1
00:00:01,637 --> 00:00:03,422
Friendship. Romance. Mystery

2
00:00:03,607 --> 00:00:05,107
Because we cherish them we can continue

3
00:00:05,342 --> 00:00:07,309
The true killer is found together
with a secret cassette tape

5
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,894
A message that sways Al's heart

6
00:00:09,145 --> 00:00:10,713
He sees through the one and only truth,

7
00:00:10,814 --> 00:00:12,448
A child in appearance
with the IQ. of an adult

9
00:00:12,648 --> 00:00:15,050
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

12
00:01:55,568 --> 00:02:01,290
Secret Hidden in the Toilet Part 2

14
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,826
After my older sister Akemi came here,

15
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:04,410
the burglars who-broke in
were probably them...

17
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:06,578
the burglars who broke in
were probably them...

19
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:07,596
Yeah

20
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:11,533
they took it that
she hid something in this house

22
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:12,801
and came to look for it...

23
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:17,539
There were traces of them having
set up wiretaps in the toilet too.

25
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:21,810
It's most. likely.that they couldn't find it
when they'broke'in here the first time.

27
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:24,079
And so they set up a wiretap. Ir

28
00:02:24,147 --> 00:02:26,315
But after hearing that the people here

29
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:28,951
knew nothing of something being hidden,

30
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:31,086
they probably broke in here a second time

31
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:33,888
to remove the wiretap.

32
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:37,426
But. I think it-has nothing to
dorwith this case:n don't you?

34
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:40,329
President Dejima could've
been your father's friend

37
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,765
and.your father may have been
a member of the Black Organization.

40
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:45,234
but they haven't met for 30 years

41
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:47,136
What if it's me that they're after...?

42
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:49,571
They killed my father's friend

43
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,041
to mentally corner me... Then what?

44
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,310
Don't be silly!!

45
00:02:55,512 --> 00:02:57,513
How could they ever
find out-something like that...

47
00:02:58,114 --> 00:02:59,180
I felt it...

48
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,785
That day when we went to:that
Department Store in Haido-cho...

50
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,687
I could feel that:callous glare...

51
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:09,525
1$ liwas going faint...

52
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:11,426
W-What Y

53
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:13,729
Tiheniwhy did you come here?!

54
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:15,898
If 'youlknew you'd be in danger why?!

55
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:18,066
I wantedito know...

56
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:19,868
Willithat do?

57
00:03:20,203 --> 00:03:21,453
Whether my parents were

58
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:25,174
really the kind of people
the organization rumored them to be...

60
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:28,977
After meeting your cheerful mother,

61
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,279
I had_this; urge of wanting to do so...

62
00:03:30,947 --> 00:03:35,517
But. letting aside my mad scientist father,

63
00:03:35,985 --> 00:03:37,686
It seems that my mother was reticent,

64
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:40,889
somber and hard to
understand as rumor has it.

66
00:03:41,124 --> 00:03:42,424
Don't be silly .

67
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:44,059
It's just rumor, isnt it?

68
00:03:44,427 --> 00:03:46,628
Don't go deciding things
without seeing for yourself!

70
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,063
Do you know what

71
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:51,166
my: mother was referred to
as in the organization...?

73
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:53,535
Hell Angel...

74
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:57,840
n Angel who fell to hell...

75
00:03:59,475 --> 00:04:02,144
Well now I'm totally'uninterested in her

76
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:03,779
and feel sort of.refreshed...

77
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:07,649
So, now that I've finished:all
I have to do here,

79
00:04:07,817 --> 00:04:09,284
Iet's leave the homicide case to the police

80
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:11,787
and hurry out of here.

81
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:13,856
I'm not even sure

82
00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:18,427
If we have any place*to,run
to at this point already: though...

84
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:24,132
But. unless we find what
your. older sister had hidden...

86
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,337
he deduced a whilea
regardingÂ«the wiretap.

88
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:31,640
Iticould be that after hearing
the conversation of the employees here.

90
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:33,876
They specified the place
the object was hidden,

92
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:36,177
broke in here a:second timem

93
00:04:36,178 --> 00:04:39,014
found what they were looking for
and retrieved the wiretap

95
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:41,316
while they were at it too, right?

96
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,937
That's why there's no reason why
we should stay here any longer...

99
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:48,357
Oh... so you were burglarized

100
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:50,525
but nothing was stolen?

101
00:04:50,726 --> 00:04:51,343
N-No...

102
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:55,898
It seems that the president thought
that his design was stolen, though...

104
00:04:56,332 --> 00:05:00,002
He insisted someone had secretly
taken a picture of his design...

106
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:03,004
The president was always
nervous about things like that...

108
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:05,574
He used to lose his temper every time

109
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:07,276
he saw a design that was similar to his...

110
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:09,244
He went to shout his mouth
off this morning too...

112
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:10,412
This morning...?

113
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:13,482
To another design office.

114
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:15,717
He went to tell them off
for stealing his design,

116
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:18,453
and he accused them of
the burglary some time ago.

118
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:19,922
H-Hey...

119
00:05:19,956 --> 00:05:20,923
Don't tell me that...

120
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:22,057
Yes.

121
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:24,393
There is a possibility that when
he went to that design office

123
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:27,862
somebody somehow
got the poison on him...

125
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:31,233
Well, I don't blame the president
for being angry though...

127
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:33,268
Because if his design is copied
and goes around,

129
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:35,771
people will get bored and it'd
be disposed of in no time...

131
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,572
Disposed of...

132
00:05:39,142 --> 00:05:39,841
Yeah...

133
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:42,878
After that burglary
a strange thing happened...

135
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:44,846
Strange thing... 2

136
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:49,016
A pen that was lost a long time ago
suddenly came out...

138
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:50,419
Right. right!!

139
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,387
I Together with my ruler!

140
00:05:53,623 --> 00:05:55,257
It was not stolen. but rather.

141
00:05:55,258 --> 00:05:56,525
Came out?

142
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,059
N No 3 t
I IUD...

145
00:05:57,327 --> 00:05:57,759
11COo...

146
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:01,229
from the shoe cabinet of
the front door. just like that...

148
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:04,599
But. wasn't that before the burglary?

149
00:06:04,734 --> 00:06:05,233
Huh

150
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:07,002
Was it?

151
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,539
But even stranger,
was the president after that!

153
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:11,340
Huh

154
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:15,777
ah... now that you mentioned
it was from just about then, wasn't it...

156
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,030
He kept going around
saying to save water!

158
00:06:18,514 --> 00:06:20,732
He started nagging us to save water...

159
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:25,253
So. we had to stop
taking showers during work...

161
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:28,807
He wasn't the type to be worried about
something like that before and yet...

163
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:30,325
See.

164
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:32,160
So that's what it was...

165
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:37,132
Could you take us to
that design office then?

167
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:41,802
It's not right after all.

168
00:06:44,173 --> 00:06:48,210
This case hasinothingito-do
with the Men] Black

170
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:50,245
The Killer:is probably...

171
00:06:50,947 --> 00:06:52,197
that man...

172
00:06:52,882 --> 00:06:54,249
He used the toilet to his advantage

173
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,785
to kill President Dejima...

174
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:58,954
And, why should we leave'when
the treasure is right beforejour.eyes.

177
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:00,222
And, why should we leave:when
the treasure is right before our ::eyes.

182
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:02,257
Then...

183
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,625
Yeah...

184
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,028
It's still there

185
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:07,862
in the toilet...

186
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:11,700
The something that your sister hid in there!

187
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,270
Inspector!

188
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:16,805
Let's go...

189
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:18,373
to that design office!

190
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,107
Yeah...

191
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:22,978
Maybe we can find out how the poison
was put on President Dejima

193
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,981
without anybody being aware...

194
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:27,449
No. you'll find nothing...

195
00:07:28,484 --> 00:07:30,285
Uh... well, you see...

196
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:32,821
Huh

197
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:36,491
Even if... there were to be
something poisonous,

199
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:39,628
wouldn't he have touched something
as soon as he.came back'here?

201
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:42,764
On the doorknob or the back of the chair...

202
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:46,401
But, the poison was detected only
on the president's left hand.

204
00:07:46,702 --> 00:07:47,986
The right side of his slacks

205
00:07:47,987 --> 00:07:50,238
the belt holes of his belt

206
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,307
the handkerchief that he had

207
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:57,646
and the wrapper of the hamburger that
he took a bite of just before he collapsedO

209
00:07:58,214 --> 00:07:59,114
Besides.

210
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:01,266
The poison was of a very small amount...

211
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:06,688
And if it was poison that rubbed"off:, when
he touched it with his poisoned hand

213
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:09,007
you can already make it out, can't you?

214
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:12,127
That is. where the poison got
on the president's hand...

216
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:12,794
Huh

217
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:15,530
Well . the place where
you loosen your belt...

219
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:17,132
pull your slacks up and down...

220
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,368
and the place where
you use a handkerchief...

222
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:23,755
D Don't tell me...

223
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,707
In the t oilet?!

224
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:28,810
Yes...

225
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:31,313
President Dejima came in contact with the

226
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,082
poison in the toilet and was killed...

227
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,885
by one of the three employees. over there!

228
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:54,351
But... Dr. AgasaO!

229
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:57,088
There was no poison reaction
found in the toilet...

231
00:08:57,824 --> 00:08:59,691
It's most natural that
there was no reaction!!

233
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,161
Because the thing with
the poison smeared on it

235
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:09,134
was taken out of the toilet by
President Dejima himself!

237
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:11,036
W-What?!

238
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:12,871
Taken out?

239
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,723
The thing that

240
00:09:14,724 --> 00:09:18,109
you have to throw away
once you use it up...

242
00:09:18,678 --> 00:09:21,178
There wasn't any aromatic inside...

243
00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:22,981
And if he changed the towel

244
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:25,851
it would've been a cleaner towel...

245
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:27,919
Then, all that'd be left is changing
the roll of the toilet paper...

247
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:29,821
Right!

248
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,423
The cylinder!!

249
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,075
The cylinder of the-toilet-paper!!

250
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,795
If poison is smeared-on-it
and it's left in place.

252
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:39,264
When paper runs out and
the roll has to be changed

254
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:41,933
the person would take the cylinder
empty roll out of the 'toilet to dispose of it!

256
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:44,986
B-But if so...

257
00:09:45,203 --> 00:09:47,606
poison should/be found on the toilet paper

258
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:49,508
that had been newly changed...

259
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,178
After you change the toilet paper roll,
you usually use it, don't you?

261
00:09:53,513 --> 00:09:56,648
The part with the poison on it was torn off,

262
00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:01,086
used and flushed down the toilet!

263
00:10:01,487 --> 00:10:03,288
I see...

264
00:10:03,456 --> 00:10:04,055
Huh 2

265
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:07,292
You see. now are you convinced?

266
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:13,532
Nd... this is probably what?
President Dejima did in the toilet!

268
00:10:14,684 --> 00:10:18,135
First, he realized that
the roll was out of paper.

270
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:21,005
He touched the roll with poison
on it withrhis right hand and

272
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:21,540
put it on the floor...

273
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,941
put it on the floor...

274
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:26,945
Then, he reached over for the new roll
of toilet paper on the.shelf and replaced it

276
00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:29,147
After he finished using the:toilet paper...

277
00:10:29,415 --> 00:10:32,183
he pulled his slacks up with
his poisoned right hand

279
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:34,019
fastened his belt.

280
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:39,057
Flushed the toilet with the lever on
the left side of the tank with his right hand.

282
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,560
And washed his hands...

283
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:45,029
If he wipes his hands with the handkerchief
the poison would be wiped off,

285
00:10:45,197 --> 00:10:48,099
and if he takes the used up toilet
paper roll and comes out of the toilet...

287
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:51,536
no poison would be left inside the toilet!!

288
00:10:51,703 --> 00:10:55,040
But. the poison was: detected
on the victim's: left hand:

290
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:57,207
He wasn't left-handed and yet

291
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,077
why would the poison that was
on the roll go on his left hand...

293
00:11:00,346 --> 00:11:02,047
Come on. Inspector!

294
00:11:02,248 --> 00:11:04,049
If you open the door with your right hand,

295
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,718
you would naturally:hold the roll with
your left hand, wouldn't you.

298
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:13,441
0 eCSese

299
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:15,610
So. he brings the roll out of the toilet and

300
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:16,962
throws it into the waste basket,

301
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:20,731
then he grabs the burger with
his poisoned left hand. eats it.

303
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,201
And died!

304
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:25,537
Shall we test it out?

305
00:11:25,804 --> 00:11:26,471
Huh?

306
00:11:27,006 --> 00:11:29,307
Lets go-into the toilet...

307
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:38,883
h... Hey?! Dr. Agasa

308
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:42,754
The most important thing isn't solved yet!!

309
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:45,090
Who of the three employees is the one

310
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:47,692
that set up this trick?

311
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:50,562
The most suspicious would be the one who

312
00:11:50,563 --> 00:11:53,965
went into the toilet right before
the president, but...

314
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,767
H-Hold it

315
00:11:55,835 --> 00:11:57,235
but isn't it strange?

316
00:11:57,636 --> 00:12:01,473
It's true thatlthe president can be poisoned
to death in the way he just explained, but

318
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:04,709
unless the president has the runs,
goes to the toilet and

320
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,411
uses toilet paper.

321
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:09,279
While in the meantime.somebody
goes out to buy the hamburgers,

323
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,082
this crime wouldn't have occurred!!

324
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:15,020
Besides, the president's the one who
said he wanted to eat hamburger...

326
00:12:17,857 --> 00:12:21,159
It does fit in a bit too well...

327
00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:22,894
So...

328
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:23,260
So...

329
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:26,130
The killer carried out
epeated simulations...

331
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,036
President Dejima probably
didn't even dream that...

333
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,606
in the coffee that Mr. Ima
served him everyday.

335
00:12:36,142 --> 00:12:38,710
There was laxative!

336
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:40,478
) L-Laxative?!

337
00:12:45,051 --> 00:12:46,151
Mr. Imai's the one...

338
00:12:46,952 --> 00:12:48,553
What?!

339
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,525
He put more laxative in
the coffee everyday

341
00:12:53,526 --> 00:12:55,243
to get the president used to the taste.

342
00:12:55,244 --> 00:12:57,262
And he calculated the timing of
the president going to the toilet

344
00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:59,029
with the amount of laxative
he put in the coffee...

346
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:00,165
Then...

347
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:03,635
the president had frequent
runs lately because...

349
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:05,070
Yes,

350
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:08,873
and since the president
orde ed hamburger.

352
00:13:08,874 --> 00:13:11,142
Ee ed ee oO I epresi en ocay.

353
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:15,814
Mr. Imai brought the cookie
toget er wit) te co ee so that

355
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:18,450
it would urge the president
to go to the toilet...

357
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:20,318
When people eat.

358
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:22,387
A strong peristaltic movement

359
00:13:22,388 --> 00:13:26,891
takes place from the transverse colon
to the sigmod colon...

361
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:29,461
In other words when something
goes into the stomach.

363
00:13:29,595 --> 00:13:31,830
The need to move one's bowels occurs!

364
00:13:33,032 --> 00:13:35,366
Well, if President Dejima was talking

365
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:37,702
Iaxatives on a regular basis
because of his hemorrhoids...

367
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,305
there would nothing
strange about laxatives

369
00:13:40,306 --> 00:13:42,891
being detected in his body
during the autopsy .

371
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:46,177
And even if laxatives were
to be found in his coffee...

373
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:48,913
I would just be thought that he had
always been drinking his coffee that way.

375
00:13:48,914 --> 00:13:51,382
So. there would be nothing suspicious!

376
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:52,917
Which means that

377
00:13:53,018 --> 00:13:55,019
Mr. Imai set the poison up

378
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:57,288
when he went to the toilet...

379
00:13:57,356 --> 00:13:58,423
Hey. hey!

381
00:13:58,824 --> 00:14:00,759
I went in before him?

382
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,627
If I didn't urinate but went to
move my bowels instead,

384
00:14:02,628 --> 00:14:04,195
you mean I would've been dead?

385
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,029
(No!

386
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:09,534
(You always hold your drink
in your left hand and

388
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:13,238
and if you had to frequently urinate, it isn't
hard to imagine that you'd do the same

390
00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:15,173
If you moved your bowels,

391
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:18,009
he was probably planning to give you
a wet tissue or something...

393
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,579
Telling you to wipe
your hands before eating...

395
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:24,616
How can you tell if somebody's going
to urinate or move his bowels?

397
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,685
He couldn't have looked into the toilet...

398
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,054
The sound of the toilet being flushed.

399
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,390
F-Flushed?

400
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:36,728
If President Dejima was nagging
everyone about saving water,

402
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:40,765
you wouldn't use the lever that flushes a lot
of water when you urinate. would you?

404
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:43,835
He knew that Conan and Au

405
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:46,638
who went into the toilet after
you and were rushed out of there

407
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,808
by:the president and didn't touch
theijpoison:smeared toilet paper roll.

409
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:51,442
Okay

410
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,046
All:lwe need to find now is the roll that
President Dejima threw away somewhere!

412
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:55,680
Yes! Sir!

413
00:14:56,015 --> 00:14:56,981
Wait!

414
00:14:57,116 --> 00:14:59,017
He always throws it in here...

415
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,486
See! I foundit!

416
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:03,388
I-inspector!

417
00:15:05,424 --> 00:15:06,925
Okay, forensic officer!!

418
00:15:07,927 --> 00:15:10,528
If there's poison,on this.

419
00:15:10,663 --> 00:15:12,964
There should be a bag that
was used to carry it here,

421
00:15:12,965 --> 00:15:15,567
or a container for poison somewhere...

422
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:18,736
It's inside the triangular garbage
disposenrdin the kitchen...

424
00:15:20,573 --> 00:15:21,773
If it were me...

425
00:15:21,774 --> 00:15:24,042
After I go to the toilet
and set the poison up,

427
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:27,345
after going to the kitchen to make.coffee.

428
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:29,781
I would hide it there...
It's dirty and stink.

430
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:32,517
And a place nobody would want to:itouch...

431
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:35,386
He wouldn't have to go and
dispose of it himself later...

433
00:15:35,454 --> 00:15:38,356
Because somebody else would
probably do it for him anyway...

435
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:45,964
And unlikeithe;waste basket: just in case
he wants to:change the; place he hid it

437
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:48,183
it.would be easy to retrieve

438
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:52,070
Inspector!!

439
00:15:52,404 --> 00:15:54,505
I found a strange plastic bag inside

440
00:15:54,573 --> 00:15:56,608
the triangular garbage
container in the kitchen!!

442
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:57,809
Oh. you did!

443
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,513
If poison is detected from this bag
and your fingerprints are-on it...

445
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:04,649
I'm sure you'll find both...

446
00:16:05,584 --> 00:16:08,553
I had it on me day and night so that

447
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:11,823
I wouldn't miss the chance
to kill the president...

449
00:16:13,726 --> 00:16:17,295
I first intended to kill him
about 20 years ago.

451
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:19,464
T-Twenty years ago...

452
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:21,099
Yeah...

453
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:24,769
Not too long after you came to this office...

454
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,803
Remember,

455
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:28,473
I went independent and quit here,

456
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:30,441
and came back again...

457
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:32,010
It was back then...

458
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:34,812
Yeah, I heard about it from
the president some time ago...

460
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:37,815
That you went independent,
Il but couldn't make it

462
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:38,816
SO he picked you up again...

463
00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:41,653
That I couldn't make it...

464
00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:43,888
There was no way I could make it...

465
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,524
because the president was
moving behind the scenes

468
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:48,793
CON ac INg Ye puÂ» Is INg companies...

469
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:51,879
telling them not to give a traitor any work.

470
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:54,632
Are you serious?

471
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,700
Yeah,

472
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:58,670
a publisher friend told me...

473
00:16:58,904 --> 00:17:02,040
I was enraged then too,
to the point of no return...

475
00:17:03,392 --> 00:17:06,511
Iiwas=thinking of how to kill him
when he cames back...

477
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:10,231
I was thinking all sorts
of things in the kitchen...

479
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:12,116
Then it just so happened that

480
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:15,687
Akemiwho:was there with her parents
was standing behind me...

482
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:18,656
Sherasked me,
What's wrong? You look scary

484
00:17:18,857 --> 00:17:19,791
are youjlooking-for;something?

486
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:22,827
r. are:you 1cing:some 1ng.

487
00:17:23,362 --> 00:17:26,664
Don't hide it in the triangular
garbage container

489
00:17:26,932 --> 00:17:29,434
because somebody might throw it away)

490
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:32,737
She remarkedjatime: with
a sad*look on:her'face...

492
00:17:33,372 --> 00:17:37,408
When I answered, I think I'm just tired.

493
00:17:37,993 --> 00:17:39,877
She-smiled and...

494
00:17:41,613 --> 00:17:42,512
It was after that.

495
00:17:43,182 --> 00:17:48,286
Akemi started hiding
our things all over the place...

497
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:52,022
But. after seeing her innocent smile

498
00:17:52,691 --> 00:17:55,193
my will to kill vanished off somewhere...

499
00:17:57,863 --> 00:18:00,999
Then... why did you decide to go
rough it at this time...

501
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,752
The other day when I told the president
I wanted to go independent again,

503
00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:06,587
this is what he said...

504
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:09,140
You would never make it at your age.

505
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,878
It would've been a different;story
if this were 20 years ago, though...

507
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:17,448
It was a long time since I've seen her last,
and twas feeling like anything was possible.

509
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,518
So, the president's words
really made me blow my top...

511
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:22,887
S-She...

512
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:25,823
you mean Akemi who
came to use the restroom?

514
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:27,959
Yeah...

515
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:30,294
The thing is. I was kind expecting
her to come around again,

517
00:18:30,462 --> 00:18:32,413
after she smiled and said...

518
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:36,000
I'll come back again

519
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:38,403
with my younger sister in about a week...

520
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:41,906
But... she never came...

521
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,941
I thought that she would
blow off my intent to kill with

523
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:47,028
that smile of hers again,

525
00:18:47,613 --> 00:18:49,414
but... I guess I was just.being; selfish.

526
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,041
And.

527
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,926
You found it, didn't you?

528
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:04,829
When you went into
the restroom with Dr. Agasa...

530
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:07,331
The thing that Akemithid. .!

531
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,268
Huh? Yeah...

532
00:19:11,403 --> 00:19:13,771
It dawned on me when they said, as soon
as your sister came to use the restroom,

534
00:19:14,106 --> 00:19:20,344
President Dejima started nagging them
about saving water :all of a sudden...!

536
00:19:21,113 --> 00:19:23,347
That something must've been

537
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:25,316
6 attached to the float in the toilet tank...

538
00:19:25,517 --> 00:19:28,319
So that water was flowing out little by little.

539
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:33,374
I opened the tank and checked behind
the float. then! Sure enough...

541
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:36,627
A plastic bag with something inside

542
00:19:36,728 --> 00:19:39,430
it was firmly attached to
the float with masking tape...

544
00:19:40,065 --> 00:19:42,800
There were traces of
old maskingitape on/it too.

546
00:19:43,435 --> 00:19:44,669
SO it's most likelythat 20iyears ago...

547
00:19:44,803 --> 00:19:45,736
your' sister took

548
00:19:46,004 --> 00:19:48,839
Mr. ilmai's I guess?
I'm just tired- seriously and

550
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:51,993
hid the pens and rulers so
he could take a rest from work...

552
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:55,379
Then, 20)years-later,

553
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:58,816
she came back again, took off
the thing she,had hidden and

555
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:02,787
replacedlit with this.

556
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:05,189
She put this cassette tape
numbered from 1 to 200

558
00:20:05,457 --> 00:20:09,127
in this plastic bag!!

559
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:11,662
Cassette tape?

560
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:13,464
Yeah...

561
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:16,968
I think that there's at least some clue
about those guys in here...

563
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:20,204
Some really important information that

564
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:22,089
she doesn't want the Meniiin.Black
who are watching her to know about!!

566
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:23,975
Hey!

567
00:20:24,176 --> 00:20:26,144
Don:-tell me that. you're
Iistening to it now?!

569
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,315
I was listening to the
numbered 11 to 15. but...

571
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:34,285
there;siso much space at the top that
I haven't heard anything yet.

573
00:20:34,553 --> 00:20:36,020
No. don't!!

574
00:20:36,155 --> 00:20:38,156
It's something you don't
need to know about!!

576
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:41,159
If you: delve any deeper,
you'll really...

578
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:45,663
Sorry Ar

579
00:20:46,231 --> 00:20:48,633
This-is:definitely a tape
I shouldnst be listening to...

581
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:50,334
It's yours...

582
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:52,470
and your voice only...

583
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:54,489
Listen to it.

584
00:21:01,113 --> 00:21:03,164
To Shiho who has turned 11 years old...

585
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:05,683
Happy Birthday...

586
00:21:06,502 --> 00:21:08,252
MM Mother?

587
00:21:08,754 --> 00:21:11,255
Have you found .
Somebody you like?

589
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,291
My first love was when...

590
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:15,660
She probably...

591
00:21:16,328 --> 00:21:19,363
gave the tape to Akemi after feeling
that her life would soon be.ending.

593
00:21:20,532 --> 00:21:23,401
Sheisent words to her maturing daughter
up to her daughter's 20th birthday

595
00:21:24,102 --> 00:21:26,470
of the love she felt for her...

596
00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:28,940
Akemi who received the tape
couldn't give it to TA:

598
00:21:29,074 --> 00:21:31,358
because of severe monitoring...

599
00:21:32,194 --> 00:21:34,579
But, she probably
remembered hiding things

601
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:37,081
at the design office in the past
and hid it in the toilet there...

603
00:21:37,082 --> 00:21:39,567
so. she could secretly give it to you...

604
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,287
I'm happy for you Au...

605
00:21:46,657 --> 00:21:47,124
Mother...

606
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:53,998
Your mother was genuinely an angel...

607
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:20,958
Sorry to keep you waiting...

608
00:22:21,627 --> 00:22:25,630
I don't think I'll need any helpÂ¥from you but,

609
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:29,400
Anyway... get her the minute you see her,
