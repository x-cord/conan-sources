1
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:04,971
Just as flowing water has no form,
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:07,273
deductions take all shapes and styles
in each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:10,576
That unforgettable melody
brought us an unusual case.

7
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,178
He sees through the one and only truth.

8
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,946
A child in appearance
with the l.Q. of an adult,

10
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:17,617
no case is left
unsolved with Detective Conan.

12
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:58,217
I get involved in a case &
end up getting hurt

14
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,454
The-blood-transfusion
from Ran saves me...

16
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:05,057
But Ran has guessed who I really'am!!

17
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,731
An antidote Al makes for me
changes me back into Shinichi,

19
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,166
and then she disguises
herself to look like Conan

21
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,335
so that Ran's suspicions will vanish...

22
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:25,745
Please...l need just a little more time...

23
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,949
she's waiting for me... U

24
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,820
I can't turn into Conan
again now...not;yet...

26
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,594
Ha iHaibara?! You...

27
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:44,096
Why ..Why

28
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,700
24 minutes over time...

29
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,369
I guess that's the maximum
tolerance level...

31
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,872
I'll consider this a loan...

32
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,043
Conan?

33
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:04,750
(RAR)
THE ENTRUSTED MUSIC BOX
PART I

37
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,454
What is it?...

38
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:13,859
The antidotesfor the apoxin 4869!
You stilllhave some, don't you?

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,461
May I have some?

41
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,695
Not on your life!

42
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,632
I wouldn't think of giving you any,
not with your habit of unthinkingly

44
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:22,301
getting.involved with
any dangerous crime you come across

46
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,637
Forget'about it!

47
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,374
Well let me apologize then...
I'll try to be more careful next time...

49
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:31,343
I already told you!
Hat was+*a trial drug...

51
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,581
I can"tygo around
administering'unperfected drugs...

53
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,784
You could really die from it next time...

54
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,687
I guess you can't come up with
the real thing using

56
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,789
only the ingredients for paikal

57
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,657
Yes...

58
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,093
If only we had the data for the real drug...

59
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,760
Oh well,

60
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:51,297
you should just be grateful she fell for
our ruse and count your blessings

62
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,965
Oh rats!

63
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,567
If I'd known.it was going
to turn out like this,

65
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,402
I should have just told her
what I intended to!!!

67
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,777
It's Doctor Agasa

68
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:08,080
Conanxare you sure you won't come?

69
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,982
We're going to the city's indoor pool...

70
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,784
It- has a wave making machine,
it's reallypyneat

72
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,854
Sorry, I've still got a cold

73
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,891
See you later!!

74
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,860
Tee hee...

75
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,430
Al, you're in a good mood...

76
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:27,165
I bet something nice happened to you!

77
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,701
Yeah, the school lunch today was curry!

78
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,570
She's not you, Genta!

79
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,083
Well, here we go.all over again...

80
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,386
Good grief, and it's already summer

81
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,088
I guess Spring won't be entering
my life for a long time...

83
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,559
Huh?...l1 know this song...

84
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,128
It's "Haru yo Kol

85
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:03,903
I'm back...

86
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,372
Hi Conan, welcome home!

87
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,175
Why I didn't know you had a son too

88
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,578
I don't,
I'm just taking care of this kid and...

90
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,647
What's wrong with this music box...

91
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,049
it sounds like it's skipping
a few keys here & there

93
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,984
This is none of your business!

94
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,354
How old are you, son?

95
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,356
Uh, er, 7, I think...

96
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:28,160
He's in the 1st grade but
he's very perceptive &

98
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,129
he's a big{help when it
comes to solving crimes!

100
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:34,766
I see...l guess that makes you
a little detective doesn't it...

102
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,901
Ehehe

103
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:36,902
Oh, that's right!

104
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,871
Why don't you tell Conan about it?

105
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:43,442
Maybe he'll be able:to help.finding
the person Haruna'is looking for!

107
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,944
She's looking forisomeone?

108
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,480
The truth is...

109
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,150
A bell friend?

110
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:55,721
You're looking for
a pocket bell (beeper) friend?

112
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,891
Yes, that's right... His name is Shugo

113
00:05:59,226 --> 00:05:59,792
We met 3 years ago.

114
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,060
We met 3 years ago.
Haruna Yuki
Art student

117
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,528
I came to Tokyo around then
to attend an art university
Haruna Yuki
Art student

121
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,264
I came to Tokyo around then
to attend an art university

124
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:08,200
I had a hard time making
friends & I was very lonely,

126
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,971
so I started pressing numbers
at random onwmy pocket bell...

128
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,073
and sent messages saying,

129
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,008
My name is Haruna,
will you be myafriend?

131
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,943
And who would have imagined!
I got a reply:saying

133
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,413
My first girlfriend's name was Haruna.

134
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:24,950
This must be fate, let's be friends'!

135
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,519
We've been bell friends ever since...

136
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,653
Gee...

137
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:33,158
He seemed like such a nice old man
that I could confide all my secrets to...

139
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,362
Then if you.send a message with your
pocket bell that you want to see him,

141
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,663
won't"he come?

142
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,633
That's no longer possible...

143
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,534
You see, his pocket bell...

144
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,536
Is here, with me...

145
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,475
It was last Christmas...

146
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:58,183
I'd been working part-time
to pay for my tuition but

148
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:02,087
it was hard making ends meet
so I'd decided to quit school

150
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,658
& go back home, so I figured that
before I left, I'd meet him just once

152
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,861
so we decided to meet in front of the
Hachikostatue at the Shibuya station...

154
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:14,466
I waited for a long time...but no one
fitting his description appeared...

156
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,969
And just when I decided to
give up & leave...

158
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,511
I looked inside & found his pocket bell...

159
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,813
along with this music box

160
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:31,917
But how did you know that
that was his pocket bell?

162
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,953
There was a message
on that pocket bell . it said

164
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,957
This music box is worth a lot of money,

165
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:44,363
please use it to pay for your tuition &
don't give up your dreams, Haruna

167
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:48,067
I couldn't very well accept such an
expensive present, now could I?

169
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,969
Thatis why I thought I'd have it looked at
& maybe the owner couldrbe found,

171
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,073
then I could giverit back

172
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,276
I took it to an antique shop...

173
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:03,215
But the antique dealer said it was
just an old, broken music box...

175
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:10,589
And I've started gettingtstrange
messages on my pocket bell...

177
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,458
Strange messages?

178
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,827
It said, "I have something to ask you.

179
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,830
Meet me at the place
I've indicated, come alone...

181
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,832
And then? Did you go?

182
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:24,536
No...because the tone
just wasn't Shugo's style

184
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,606
it scared me somehow,
that's why I didn't go. O

186
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:34,413
Later that night though, I got messages
reading. Thief'. more than 10 of them...

188
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,048
More than 10...

189
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,385
Thief, eh... Do you know what it mean?.

190
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,823
And there was no way to contact
the 'sender to ask what it meant.

192
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,894
I thought it might have
something to do with Shugo,

194
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,796
that's why I came to you for help...

195
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,165
And are you still getting those messages?

196
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,502
No. thev kept coming but not anvmorjes

197
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:57,302
Hmmm

198
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,103
Hmmm...

199
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:02,541
that means this music
box is our only clue...

201
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:07,012
But what can an off tune
1usic box possibly tell us...

203
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,781
I don't think it's a lost cause

204
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:09,782
Huh?

205
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,250
Here, look!

206
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,452
The pins on the drum of
this music box are broken.

208
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,855
And it doesn't look like
they broke off naturally

210
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,690
because of long use,
it looks like they were

212
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,592
deliberately twisted &
broken of, doesn't it...

214
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:21,560
You're right...

215
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,696
It could be some kind of message!

216
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,198
It's possible...

217
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:30,803
the song is, Haru yo Koi" & the missing
notes are the la, do & la at the end...

219
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,037
Ladola?

220
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,005
It sounds like some kind of monster...

221
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,108
Do you know the words
for the missing parts?

223
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,743
Eh. Let's see...

224
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,646
that part of the song goes,
Onmo e detai to matte iru, which means

226
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,449
the missing parts are...

227
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,317
[Mo] and [de] and [ru]

228
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,452
Mo..de..ru

229
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,954
IModel!!

230
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,290
Shugo's a model!

231
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:55,194
Now that we know that much, we can
ask around all the model agencies...

233
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,029
That won't be ncessary,

234
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,965
it'll be faster if we go
talk to him personally

236
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,435
Stupid, she can't do that,
that's why she's here...

238
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,805
But you have the number
for his pocket bell, don't you?

240
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,175
Then you can explain
the situation to Officer Takagi

242
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,577
and have him contact
the pocket bell company

244
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,214
I'm sure we'll be able to get an address...

245
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,584
Way to go, Conan!!!

246
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,753
We've got the address
AND the telephone number!

248
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,555
You could be smarter than Shinichi!

249
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,957
Not really...

250
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,558
Officer Takagi did the work...

251
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,061
Humph

252
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,996
that's what I call abusing his authority...

253
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:36,034
By the way. Haruna, are you sure
he said you could visit him?

255
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:37,469
Yes...

256
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,472
but I don't think he was the
one who answered the phone

258
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,575
Everyone in his family seemed to

259
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,010
know he was very much into
pocket bell communication.

261
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:47,779
So when I told them that

262
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,749
I wanted to return the pocket bell and
music box I was keeping for him,

264
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,384
I was told to come by anytime...

265
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,420
I'm really looking forward to meeting him!

266
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,622
Yes, so am I...

267
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:03,862
Excuse me!

268
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:04,997
It's me, Haruna!!

269
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:05,797
Yes!

270
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,866
Please come in...

271
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,402
Oh my, you've brought friends along...

272
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,505
Oh my, you've brought friends along...
Kazuko Ogata

274
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:13,739
Oh my, you've brought friends along...

275
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,242
I guess you could say we're her escorts...

276
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,711
Mother, we can talk about that later...

277
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:20,512
Shiro...

278
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:23,782
The infamous Haruna
has come to pay us a visit...

280
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,652
Let's have her relax
in her room for awhile...

282
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,255
After all, she was such
a comfort to our grandfather...

284
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:32,224
Your grandfather?

285
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:33,926
That's right

286
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,962
but first, why don't you
offer him some incense...

288
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,164
Did she say incense...

289
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:40,632
You don't think...

290
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,337
Did he pass:away?

291
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,307
Yes, very suddenly
at thelend ofllast year...

293
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:50,776
Th, that's terrible...

294
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:54,746
Did he do any modelling?

295
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,380
What?

296
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,582
I guess not, ahaha...

297
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,217
Hahaha...

298
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,119
By the way,

299
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,956
about the music box
you got from my father...

301
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,390
Yes,

302
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,191
this is it!

303
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:06,792
Here you are...

304
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,562
I understand it's worth
a lot of money so I'd like to return it!

306
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:12,630
That's very kind of you...

308
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,168
this tune...

309
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,803
Haru yo koi...

310
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,571
You...

311
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:23,475
It's the song mother
often played on the harp...

313
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,143
Mother...

314
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,445
The woman in the photo...

315
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,080
That's right...

316
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:32,351
that'symy mother Haruna next to
father's photo, she died 3 years ago.

318
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:33,685
Haruna?

319
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,253
Th, three years ago...

320
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:42,561
I think you reminded my grandfather
of our late grandmother

322
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,164
He was very happy,

323
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,033
he told everyone
Haruna hadrcome back...

325
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,670
I realize this is rude,

326
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:55,273
but isn't it rather unusual for
a man his age to be using a pocket bell?

328
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,742
Not at all...

329
00:12:56,743 --> 00:13:02,214
you see, after mother died,
father took to taking late night walks...

331
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,350
we made himycarry one along
because we were worried about him...

333
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,318
Aha...

334
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,687
Uh, by:the way...

335
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,091
Was there anything in the music box?

336
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,192
Like what?

337
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,294
Well, for instance, uh...

338
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,295
Stamps.

339
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:19,531
A set of four, they're hand carved
and worth about 200 million yen

341
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,433
A set of four, they're hand carved
and worth about 200 million yen
Minoru Ogata

344
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:24,302
Jini!

345
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,606
There's only one reason
for you to come all the way here,

347
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:31,009
grandfather told you where he hid it
and you're here to look for it, aren't you?

349
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,445
That's not why I'm here...

350
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,080
Oh never mind...

351
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,516
you'll show your true colors eventually...

352
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:41,119
you just relax and have
a nice stay. Haruna

354
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:42,320
Ld°O

355
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,654
Good grief...

356
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:46,625
Don't mind him. He's just irritated

357
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,326
because his company's
not doing too good.

359
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,226
I see...

360
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,130
We appreciate you coming here today,

361
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,865
why don't you join us for dinner

362
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,202
and we'd like to hear
about dad from you...

364
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:04,009
I wonder what that guy meant
about'stamps worth 200-million yen...

366
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:09,147
and I wonder what those missing keys
on the music box mean...

368
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,383
What does it mean...

369
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,796
Phew...

370
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:28,166
boy, all those questions,
questions, questions during dinner.

372
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,302
Poor Haruna, I feel sorry for her

373
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:35,707
Andron top of that, it starts to pour so
we end up having to spend the night...

375
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,242
Hey, don't you think this is weird?

376
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:43,448
Yes, everyone in this family except
for Shiro, the second son. is weird...

378
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,850
That.s'not what I meant...

379
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:45,817
-- Look at that,

380
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,219
behind Shugo's mortuary tablet...

381
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,155
It says he died on December 6th...

382
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,125
So what about it?

383
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:59,064
Well Harunaysaid:she;got
A the music"box last year at Christmas

386
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,133
Which means,

387
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:08,106
if Haruna is telling the truth then
it wasn't Shugo that gave it to her,

389
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,041
it mustshave been someone else, right?

390
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,949
Let's just forget all about the
unpleasantness and get some sleep...

392
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,065
Hey, what's the matter, Ran?!

393
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,702
An, an old man with a cane just walked
down the corridor and-went to the left...

395
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,071
Who's there?!

396
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:40,872
Huh?

397
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,809
There's no body out there...

398
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,044
But I'm positive I saw him go left...

399
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,882
But that's where I'm sleeping!

400
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,083
What's wrong?!

401
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,054
Has something happened?

402
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,858
It's nothing, my daughter thought
she saw a strange shadow of someone...

404
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,260
Someone's shadow?

405
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:09,134
I think their imagination
got the best of them

407
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,435
It wasn't our imagination!

408
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,805
Didn't the guest who
stayed with us the last time

410
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,742
say they thought they felt someone walk
past their pillow when they were asleep'?

412
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,845
You meaniit happened before?

413
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,713
Well, uh...yes...

415
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:26,218
we should be the only ones here tonight

416
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,353
By the way, where's Minoru?

417
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,754
Probably 'in the bath

418
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,091
Good grief, now what?

419
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,127
It sounded like a bowstring breaking

420
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,297
You don't think it's. fromithe.room
where mother keeps her 'koto...

422
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,433
Let's go and have a'look!!

423
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,505
Hey, wait for us!

424
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,014
Mi, Minoru!

425
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,249
Minoru!

426
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,652
Hang in there Minoru! Minorut!

427
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,520
Minoru wake up!!

428
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,789
Hang on, Minoru!!

429
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:13,832
It's impossible...

430
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,033
What's wrong, Haruna?

431
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,635
Haruna!

432
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,303
I don't believe it...

433
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,973
I was waiting for you Haruna?

434
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,041
What?!

438
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:34,152
Do you suppose this means that old
mans shadow we just saw as well as.

440
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:37,789
What just happened is all the work
of Shugo, the man who died last year...

442
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:42,260
You idiot! Once a.person dies,
they can't do anything!!

444
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,262
Instead of wasting time
making silly deductions,

446
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,732
get on the phone and call the policell
This could be a murder case...

448
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,334
Hey, wait

449
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,871
Ouch...don't go killing me off...

450
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:53,605
Minoru...

451
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,274
Minoru, what in the world happened?!

452
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,409
How should I know!

453
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,345
Somebody came out of nowhere and
hit me on the head with something hard...

455
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,913
Something hard

456
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,281
You mean that koto?

457
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,482
Probably...

458
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,586
Isn't that koto the one
grandmother loved the most?!

460
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,988
Haruna

461
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:13,124
don't tell me YOU
were the one who hit me!

463
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,926
1. I would never

464
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:15,993
You're wrong!

466
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,600
When we heard the loud noise,
we were all in Ran's room...

468
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,001
Right?

469
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,903
Huh? Yeah, that's right...

470
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,704
Then who did it...

471
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,139
Why are you asking?

472
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,575
You saw who hit you, didn't you?

473
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:31,176
What?

474
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,579
Because see, you were
hit on the forehead!

476
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,849
That means you were hit
from the front, right?

478
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,885
Humph! It was so dark,
I couldn't. see anything...

480
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:44,723
Eh? You mean this room
was dark too, when you got hit?

482
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:45,991
That's right...

483
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:49,227
When I heard a strange noise and felt
someone's presence in the dark

485
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,295
it was too late

486
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,564
But isn't that strange?

487
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:53,798
What do you mean?

488
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,736
What were you doing
all'by:yourself in the dark?

490
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:58,470
Eh?!

491
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:00,637
Well?

493
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:04,909
Minoru...

494
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,344
Minoru?

495
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,286
You idiot!

496
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,522
I'm sure Minoru came into this room

497
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,025
because he could
\ feel someone's presence

499
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,361
And just when he was
about to turn the lights on,

501
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,498
that person hit him with the koto!

502
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,299
Isn't that right, Minoru?

504
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:30,168
Yes...

505
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:30,769
I guess...

506
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,470
Then dad

507
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,440
what about the message on
Haruna's pocket bell?

509
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,441
Oh that...

510
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:39,177
that's probably from one of her friends

511
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,545
A friend?

512
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,517
You had probably promised
to meet a friend tonight...

514
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:50,387
but you forgot all about it
and came here...

516
00:19:50,388 --> 00:19:52,690
and so that message,
I was waiting for you"

518
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,693
was probably from
your friend complaining...

520
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,163
Am I wrong, Haruna?

521
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,798
Yes...

522
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't remember
making any such promise

525
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,838
Yes, well, a lot has
happened to you today,

527
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,873
I don't blame you for forgetting

528
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,243
Then what about the
old man's shadow I saw?

530
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:12,810
Huh?

531
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:13,845
Humph!

532
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:15,146
OR that...

533
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,714
M. maybe that's who
attacked m brother...

535
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:21,786
I don'tithink an old man with a cane
could lift a koto as heavy as that

537
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,021
and knock someone out...

538
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,322
You're absolutely right!

539
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,192
Even if that old man did exist,

540
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:30,728
he wouldn't have been able to
knock Minoru unconscious...

542
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:36,334
Besides, the old man Ran saw was
heading toward the end of the corridor...

544
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,136
and even if he tried
toihide inithe room at the end,

546
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,971
that's where Conan and I were sleeping...

547
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,739
Are you saying...

548
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,676
That old man was probably...

549
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:45,610
Probably

550
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,113
Just your imagination...

551
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,547
What?

552
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,518
As people used to say, Ghosts
are usually withered eulalia grass.

554
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,488
Now wait just one minute! I'really saw...

555
00:20:57,156 --> 00:21:01,759
You're so scared of seeing ghosts,
that's why you imagined seeing one!

557
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,961
Dad!!

558
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,930
Anyway, ma'am,
you'd better call the police!

560
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,136
There's one thing we can be sure of,
someone else besides us is in this house!

562
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:12,904
Yes, right away!

563
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,141
Could the old man be right,

564
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,677
is somebody hiding
somewhere in this house?

566
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,981
If there is, what*doythey want...

567
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:28,118
By the looks of the room,
nothing seems to have been touched...

569
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,021
So whoever-lit is,

570
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,724
Minorulis the-target...

571
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:36,327
But this isn't his room

572
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,366
and I have a pretty good idea
what he was doing here in the dark room.

574
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:47,338
But I wonder how and when
the attacker found out about it

576
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,008
And about the koto used as the weapon...

577
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:55,445
Did the attacker have a reason for
picking the koto as the weapon?

579
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,349
Rats.

580
00:21:58,384 --> 00:21:59,983
There's so many unanswered questions...

581
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,387
the shadow of the old man
Ranssaw is another mystery...

583
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,892
Was it really just her imagination?

584
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,695
And the last mystery is...

585
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,897
the off tune music box!!

586
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,702
I'm positive the music box is the
key to a very important secret...

588
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:22,906
It'll tell us where the very thing everyone
in this household is searching for, is...

590
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:29,214
It'll tell us where the stamps
worth 200 million is hidden!
