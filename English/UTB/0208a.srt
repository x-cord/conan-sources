However, those who enraged
the goddess died a ruthless death.

00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,299
So, it has been told...!

27
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,638
What a dreadful thing to do,
digging a tunnel

29
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,010
through the rocky mountain ,
where the goddess stands...

31
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:32,150
The curse of the heavens
are sure to fall upon them!

33
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,088
Oh, that must be
the statue of the goddess?

00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:41,027

There are people

It seems that you not only called me

There is actually another reason why
we've asked you to come, Mr. Mourn...

There are many who are against
the opening of the ropeway,

126

are the local shop owners and those
who will gain profit from it...!

137
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,859
Since the way my father does
things is ven aggressive,

139
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,027
he has a lot of enemies!

140
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,329
That's why I went independent
at an early age,

142
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,498
and started an import and export
business handling miscellaneous goods!

144
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,001
And, since your business
is not doing well,

146
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:05,403
didn { you come ask dad
for financial help again today?

148

00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,549
I hear a lot of things happened when
the tunnel was under construction...?

Re you Mr. Aoyagli...?

193

I see so you're the one trying
to get it going good with Rina, eh!

00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,256
Yes, I believe
I talked to you over the phone...

197
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,124
Just a sec. what is this about?

198
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,528
I wonder if he has a secret or something
he doesn't want others to know about...

201

what do you say we have
Mr. Mouri and his party

203
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,371
test ride the ropeway in preparation
for tomorrow's ceremony?

205
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,507
Oh, that sounds good, let's do that!

206
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,710
Let s have you take a look at the
splendid landscape from the terminal

208
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,845
at the top of the mountain which is the
pride and joy of Dohmoto Tours!!

211
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,884

One sheep, two sheep...

213
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:39,865
Huh, Mr. Mouri, don't tell me
you can't take high places?

215
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,801

216
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,503
How nice...

217
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,939
It is about 3,000 meters to the summit,

218
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,641
and we'll be there in about 10 minutes.

219
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,808
What's that...?

220
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,045
It s an esplanade!

221
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,947
It's closed until we open it to the public

222
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,182
After going to the summit
with the ropeway,

224
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,784
everyone will be walking back down

225
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,187
while enjoying. breathing
in the fresh air of the greenery!

227
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,489
In other words,

228
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,227
the protest of the inhabitants was
settled by financial guarantee?

230
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:11,730
However, we still get blackmails
and crank calls

232
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,832
demanding cancellation of
the opening of the ropeway...

234
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,901
Do you have any idea who Is doing this?

235
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:20,406
It's not just one or two people so...

236
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,242
Besides, there 1s a priestess called

237
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,144
Shizu Kamiya who resides
in a temple nearby...

239
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,547
making a fuss saying
that the gods will be angered.

241
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,983
The local papers wrote an article,
Does The Curse Of The Goddess Exist ./

243
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:36,555
And this is stirring fear among the
inhabitants, that we are in quite a fix.

245
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,397
Uh...? That cable car that is
headed down is empty, isn't it?

247
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,467
When one cable car moves,
so does the other.

249
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,170
It runs like a well bucket going up
on two stays,

251

It runs like a well bucket going up

Oh, I see...

257
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,487
Wow?! What is that?

258
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,889
They are the 500 disciples of
Buddha who have attained Nirvana

260
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,924
In other words.

261
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:15,427
We'll be taking a tour inside the
womb of the goddess that is above here.

263
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,396
A tour inside the womb ?

264
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,598
Does it mean that we can attain good luck

265
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,266
if we go through
the body of the goddess?

267
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,135
Well I guess you could say so.

268
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,405
Come to think of it, that man called
Aoyagi had mentioned something

270
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:29,541
about the construction of this
tunnel, hadn't he?

272
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,111
I'll bet: he's thinking of conjuring
upta scandal or something

274
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,980
in order to suck money
ff of our company...!

276
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,216
Sis, should've been more careful too!

277
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,318
Why'd she have to tell
a guy like that about it...!

279
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,652
About it 7!

280
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,553
What:is it about?

281
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,858
Oh, it's nothing but family business
that is not worth mentioning...

283
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,827
We ll be out of the tunnel
in about 30 seconds.

285
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,903
See, when the ropeway
comes up to here,

287
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,872
the top half of the goddess
statue comes Into view.

289
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:01,039
The top half of the goddess
statue comes Into view.

291
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,875
The roc « mountain was carved

292
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,077
in the shape of the goddess
about 800 years ago...

294
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:10,215
Her right hand stuck out in front
is called the form of the Yoganin.

296
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,751
In her left hand,
she is holding the Nyoihoju,

298
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,721
a crystal ball that will
get rid of disasters and unhappiness...

00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,390
For those who want to
take a good look at it

302
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,861
there is an observatory that can
be accessed from the promenade.

304
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:28,700
Aha, ha... I sort of understand why
the priestess was all upset...

306
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,470

310
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,276
Wow, what a fantastic view!

311
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,577
You don't get to see
Iandscape like this everyday

313
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:43,715
People seem so tiny when you
see something as grandiose as this!

315
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,518
Yes but those tiny people
are the ones who work

317
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,154
with grandiose nature such as this,
and develop it into tourist sites!

319
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,497
Oh...this?

320
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,433
This is a keepsake of my mother.
It's a broche made out of jade beads.

322
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,204
That's not it... Your broche is nice too,

323
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,340
but, I just thought you ook
a lot like that goddess statue!

326
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,810
Yes, kind and refined...

327
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,680
Thank you...l makes me happy,
even if you're just flattering me

329
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,950
I'm not flattering you!
Right, Conan!

331
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:18,717
St a=

332
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:19,784
Ms. Yoshino.

333
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:20,552
Yes.

334
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,422
Will you please see
Mr. Mouri to his hotel?

336
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:24,890
Yes, Sir.

337
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:25,924
What are you going to do?

338
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,560
I'm going down the
promenad 'to do final-checks

340
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,395
onsthe facilities, then come back. ;

341
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,231
I ll see you at the ceremony
tomorrow afternoon, then.

343
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,568
Wow, he's a vice president
and yet very diligent, isn't he

345
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,038
Of course! The life of the company
IS on his shoulders.

347
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,213
Hotel Dohmoto
DOUMOTO

349
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:48,614
DOUMOTO

350
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:53,351
Just great!

351
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,488
Dad: think you've'alreadydhad enough!!

352
00:10:56,523 --> 00:11:00,659
Well, they got a suite room, you know!

353
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,794
I want to enjoy it with my entire
heart and soul, sol don't lose out.

355
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,865
Well, yes, I guess it is a glamorous room.

356
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,734
I wonder If it's okay

357
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,503
They must be loaded with cash!
You don't have to worry about it!

359
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,106
But, it seemed like the 2nd son, Junpei

360
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:17,242
andsthe oldest daughter,
Rina had financial problems

362
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,978
Yes, it seemed so, and besides,

363
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,014
they didn't seem to
be getting along well either...

365
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,051
When it comes time to'/inherit the estate,
I'll bet they'll go through hell!

367
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,921
It'll be so bad that bloody rain
Is likely to fall!

369
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,790
Cut it out, dad! What a thing to say!!

370
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:39,197
I wonder why the opening ceremony
IS going to be held in the afternoon...?

372
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:58,650
Mr. Machida, shouldn't we be holding
interviews, rather than sitting here?

374
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:03,589
Hold your horses...
I didn't come here to write up a flop!

376
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,258
Where the hell is Conan?

377
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,126
He told me he had to
go to the men's room...

379
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,097
Conan,
it's going to start soon.

381
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:12,798
Okay.

382
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,902
Preparations are perfect.
Nobody's, noticed anything.

384
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,505
Phooey!
Your perfect can never be counted on!

386
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:25,344
You can't even get rid of
a hyena blackmailer like Aoyagi!!

388
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,345
But, that's...

389
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:30,248
Don't talk back to me!
In business all that matters are results!!

391
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,151
The way you are,
I cant leave the company to you!!

393
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,589
President; let's. start makingspreparations.

394
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:49,301

00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:08,887
Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for

401
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:13,759
We, at Dohmoto Tours, who are
the leaders of the world of tourism ¢

403
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,528
have always tried to preserve
cultural heritage from the days of old...

405
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,696
You darn sinners!!

408
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,134
E of the heavens will
fall upon all of you present here today!!
Priestess
hizu Kamiyama

412
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,870
You idiot!! Just what are you doing?
Take pictures!!

414
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:25,604
OO. Oh, shoots!!!

416
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:29,241
To do something as outrageous as
to dig a tunnel

418
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:32,377
under the lotus pedestal of the holy
goddess is totally abominable!

420
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,813
All of you, know thy shame!!

421
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,683
May the curse of the heavens
fall upon Eizo Dohmoto!!

423
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:42,287
We seem to have had
a guest here that was not invited,

425
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,189
but please do not
concern yourselves over her!

427
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,192
Even-the papers have
irresponsibly written gibberish

429
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,094
about that statue of the goddess!!

430
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,329
However I, Eizo Dohmoto shall
scatter all such nonsense away for you!!

432
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:56,068
That isywhy we have with us here today,

433
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:03,575
among our honored guests,
the renowneDetective Kogoro Mourille Say.

435
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:10,481
Well, hello, everyone, I am Kogoro Mourt!

436
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,318
Thank you, thank you!

437
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:17,389
Mr. Machida, this is really
something! Kogoro Mouri is here!

439
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,558
Don't you think there's
something fishy going on?

441
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,128
What?!
You mean it's not him, but a look alike?

443
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,563
Oh, never mind...

444
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:29,234
Why on earth did Eizo Dohmoto
call us here for?

446
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,612
The Mt. Tenbu will now
begin its first trial run!

448
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:44,583
The second group of people
will get on the second cable

450
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,853
that will arrive afterithe first
cable car reaches the top!

452
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,560
That's?!

453
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,163
The two there are
journalists from Tokai Nippo,

455
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,432
the agency that
Is attackingaDohmoto Tours...

457
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:05,537
Why would they be here before all the
other agencies and take the trial run?

459
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,117
You fools

460
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,293
Look, look, Mr. Aoyagi,
the view is fantastic.

462
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,295
How do you like it, Mr. Machida?

463
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:33,064
Why not try writing some good
things about us for a change?

465
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,333
Are you trying to bribe me?

466
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,604
If you do, I'll.-make an
article of that too!

468
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,008
Absolutely! I wonder how long
you can keep it up?

470
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,009
Hmm?!

471
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,898
H Hey, Mr. Machida, take a look at that!

472
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,701
The statues of the 500 disciples
of Buddha who attained Nirvana?!

474
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,505
You mean you made things like that
using the power of money?!

476
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:16,942
I'd rather you take me
to be a reli ious man...

479
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,778
I'm sure that this would
become the talk of the town

481
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,646
and we'll have visitors avalanching in!

482
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,349
Wanting to worship and pray
to the statue of the goddess,

484
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,851
as well as the statues of
the 500 disciples of Buddha!

486
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,320
In other words, I have every
reason to be given gratitude

488
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,590
from the statue of the goddess,
and no reason to be cursed by it!!

490
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:33,892
Hmm? What's up?

491
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:34,326
Hmm? What's up?

492
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,095
What?! What's up?! Is it a black out?

493
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,397
Hey just what do you
think you're doing!! Don't!!

495
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:40,665
Y,.You're...?!

496
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,601
Somebody! Somebody, give us light!

497
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,503
Use the flash of the camera!!

498
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,878
Use the flash once more!!

499
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:53,678
OO, Okay!

500
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,486
What the?!

501
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,287
T,This is...?!

502
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:02,854
T, This is...?!

503
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,322
T,This is absurd?!

504
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:05,924
The President's?!

505
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:07,459
He's gone!!

506
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:12,897
The windows cannot be opened! The two
journalists are by the door to the left!!

508
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,033
By the door to the right is \ aka!

509
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:16,801
The ceiling only has a small ventilation hole!

510
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,472
The emergency exit...!
Hasn't been used yet!!

512
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,406
Then, where did he disappear to?!

513
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,876
What is with this talisman?!

514
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,845
The principle of cause and effect'?

515
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,749
Cause and effect?
You will pay for your sins?

517
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,684
D.Dad 1s over there!

518
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:35,320
What?!

519
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,358
That 1s indeed Mr. Eizo Dohmoto!

520
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,261
It looks like something
IS stabbed into his chest!

522
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,363
Contact somebody with
the cell phone immediately!!

524
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,400
No, because there are no
antennas in this area yet!

526
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,068
There's a phone once we
get to the top though...

528
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:53,070
This is ridiculous!!
Can something like this really happen?!

530
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,518
Something's happened to the President!

531
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,421
Get the police and let the people below
know about this right away!!

533
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:10,088
Yes, sir!!!

534
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,325
We'll head down over to the statue
of the goddess using the hiking path!!

536
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,159
This is Machida!

537
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,762
Please leave one page of the evening
news open! There's been a curse!!!

539
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:20,999
Eizo Dohm0to's been stabbed! on top
of the palm of the statue of the goddess!!

541
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,539
Ayaka, 'What's wrong? Are you okay? -

542
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,642
I just felt a little faint! Never mind me,
check on the president!

544
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,844
Y,Yes
I'll go on ahead then...

546
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,279
Let's go, Conan!

547
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:52,564
Mr. Mouri, the statue of the goddess
IS up these stairs!!

549
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,445
It takes 15 minutes to get up here!!

550
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,164
He's been stabbed right
in the chest and is dead!!

552
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,033
Father!!

553
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,770
It can't be!! You've gotta be joking
saying that he's dead right, Mr. Moun!!!

555
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,974
I understand how you feel but he's dead!

556
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:42,447
It.It can't be...
It wasn't supposed to turn out like this...

558
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,952
Vice president please get a hold of yourself!

559
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,320
Huh?! Ayaka, are you all right?

560
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,391
Yes, I'm fine...ll won't be able to
do my job as a secretary,

562
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,760
being rendered helpless at a time like this.

563
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:09,841
There!

564
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,845
Hi, there, so it's you?

565
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,581
Oh!<Mr. Mouril!
Not you again?

567
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,451
Just what do you mean! Am I supposed
to be the god of death or something?

569
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:23,088
If so, have the statue of the
goddess help you out this time!

571
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:28,193
Oh no! I'm just delighted that I get
to hear your superb deduction again!

573
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:31,096
Doni tell me that this is some«kind
of curse, though!

575
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,598
There are rumors of that sort
going around so...

577
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,100
No such thing!

578
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:38,536
The killer is among the ones
who were in the ropeway!

580
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,338
What?! Is that true?

581
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,440
Which means the killers
among those people over there?!

583
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,410
Before Eizo disappeared from
inside the cable car,

585
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,645
there was a sound of someone fighting.

586
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,682
Moreover, a strange talisman was
found pasted to the window!

588
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,952
The killer must have
In some way pushed Eizo

590
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:57,622
from the ropeway onto the tunnel below!

591
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:01,593
But, no one who was
in the cable car got off

593
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,895
until it reached the top, right?

594
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,999
It s likely that an accomplice
was inside the tunnel.

596
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,400
I"think. that's highly unlikely...

597
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:13,137
Why you! Keep your big mouth shut!!

598
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,641
Wait a sec. Mr. Mourn!
Conan just what do you mean?

600
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:21,713
Well, it takes the ropeway only 30
seconds to get through the tunnel!

602
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,815
Even if there were to be an accomplice,

603
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:26,518
I wonder if it would be possible
to move the victim from the tunnel up

605
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,685
to the palm of the statue of
the goddess in just 30 seconds?

607
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:33,258
Ayaka, aren't there any secret elevators

608
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,260
or something that can get you
from the tunnel to this observatory?

610
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:39,764
There is no such thing...Of course,
though...for maintenance purposes,

612
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:43,635
there is a path leading from the tunnel, to
part way of the stairs of the observatory

614
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,804
That's it! The killer used
that route and killed Eizo!!

616
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:49,941
But to get from the tunnel
to the observatory

618
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:53,111
it would take even asmant
who runs at least 3sminutes.

620
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:56,281
3.3 minutes...?! Wait a sec.!

621
00:21:56,282 --> 00:22:00,451
From the time of the black out to
the time we found Eizo in the palm of

623
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,354
the statue of the goddess,
it took about 30 seconds.

625
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,724
So, if'it takes 3 minutes...

626
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,327
No, I think it takes even more time.

627
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:13,731
It's unthinkable that Mr. Eizo Dohmoto
would stay quiet being kidnapped!

629
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,434
Which means he would have
had to been killed right away!

631
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,971
However, if someone were to
carry the corpse on his back and go

633
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,839
from the tunnel to observatory , it would
take double the time, 6 minutes, not 3!

635
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,376
No,it would probably even take more!

636
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:28,346
Right! More unimaginable than the fact

637
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,216
that the victim disappearing
from within the ropeway is that!

639
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,818
It's a curse!!

640
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:39,958
What sight having to display a corpse
in the palm of the statue of the goddess

642
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,794
It sure is rightful punishment
from the heavens

644
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:46,497
for Eizo Dohmoto who
has turned money hungry!!

646
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,813
It's too impossible to
be called a homicide!

648
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:09,220
Don t tell me that this ls really
some kind of curse?

650
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,624
That it really us the fury of the goddess?
