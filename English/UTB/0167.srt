1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,002
Inspiration flashes piercing right
through to the truth.

3
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,704
Once he gets going nothing can stop him.

4
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,539
The case at the "spider mansion
becomes more complicated.

6
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,274
Ran and
Kazuha are in a danger situation.

8
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,176
The one and only truth is brought into light

9
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,944
He looks like a child but he s t
the brains of an adult.

11
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,680
His name is... Detective Conan!

12
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:55,181
We were called out to the Takeda home
at Trick Ridge in Tottori Prefecture

14
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:59,318
Heilji Hattori and Kazuha
Toyama get lost in the forest

16
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,854
and meet up with an American by the
name of Robert Taylor.

18
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:06,025
We happen to pass by and find outsthat
we«had -all'fbeen:- called out to

20
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:08,194
to the Takeda home to solve the mystery
of the curse

22
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:10,496
at the "spider mansion of Trick Ridge".

23
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:17,168
On the night we arrive, the eldest
on of the Takeda family: Nobukazu,

25
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:19,638
commits suicide on-the second floor
of the doll storehouse.

27
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,876
Furthermore, someone suspicious
appears behind Kazuha...

29
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:32,785
MYSTERY OF THE SPIDER
MANSION OF TOTTORI

31
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:38,591
I'm sorry Kazuha! I've found the mascot
I was looking for!

33
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,227
It was caught on the Cover of the
CD player

35
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,630
Kazuha? Where are you?

36
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,534
Kazuha's penlight...

37
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:54,640
Kazu ha. . . .Kazu ha'?

38
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:01,447
Hey, look at this!
Looks like he's been hit on the back

40
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,249
of the head with something!!

41
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,583
What?!

42
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,453
Then, the murderer hit him and then...

43
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:11,991
Yes, the time of death is about 9:00 p.m.

44
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:15,394
just around the time Nobukazu
Ieft the living room.

46
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:20,199
At that time, he had already been
called out by the murderer.

48
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:24,470
The murderer met Nobukazu
here-and hit him,/on the head

50
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:28,274
put him unconscious then,
strung him up by the neck.

52
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,677
That's right! He wrapped a lot of
string around the body

54
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,713
to make it look like the curse of
the "spider empress!

56
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,551
Ummmm... But, I don't understand...

57
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:42,755
How did the murderer escape from the
room after he committed the crime?

59
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:49,595
Nobukazu's sandals and flashlight
scattered on the floor also bothers me.

61
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:53,599
It's also.strange that there's no
dust on the shelves and floor.

63
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,535
The room was-supposedsto have been
Ieft alone for three years.

65
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,003
Hey, kid!

66
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:01,373
H, that small window...

67
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,044
A child can barely fit through it but

68
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:09,949
Is there something to it? A reason
why it had to be left open?

70
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,418
No... I thought heard.

71
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,254
Ran's voice outside the window...

72
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,222
Huh?

73
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,224
And, Kazuha's voice too...

74
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:23,062
Idiot! Those two are probably in their
room fast asleep...

76
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,432
Hey! What was that sound?

77
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:27,466
Shhh! The stairs!

78
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:27,766
Shhh! The stairs!

79
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:28,434
Shhh! The stairs!

80
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,406
Someone's coming up the stairs!

81
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,343
Heavy feet... It's not Ran...

82
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,680
Who'd be coming here?

83
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,615
Never mind...

84
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:47,987
Let's meet him in person
and ask him what the reason 1s!!

86
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,757
Good grief! It's the housekeeper.

87
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,891
What's the matter?

88
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:57,596
I thought you'd be hungry sol
brought you some rice balls and tea.

90
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,533
Oh, this looks delicious!!

91
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,170
Kazuha! Are you here!

92
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,272
Answer me If you're here!

93
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,407
Kazuha!!

94
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:15,548
Oh, so you know Misa Takeda
who died three years ago?

96
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:19,385
Yes, we were nurses at the
same hospital

98
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:23,989
but, the.work was too hardsfor me and
I quit...

100
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:28,460
I became a housekeeper here through
Misa's introduction.

102
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,362
Thank you.

103
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,799
Misa was a really nice girl...

104
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,268
always attentive and kind...

105
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,870
But why?

106
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,838
Why does a person like that have to
commit suicide?

108
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,444
Just maybe... that could be. the reason!

109
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:51,684
Misa's father Nobukazu, came home
from the hospital for some reason

111
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:55,688
he grabbed his wife, Kinuyo, and was
In great anger.

113
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,526
He said, "you really deceived me for
the past 20 years!!!

115
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,528
Deceived him... about what?

116
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:07,132
Well... I have no idea...

117
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,903
And, that's when Misa got badly hurt.

118
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,004
Badly hurt?

119
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:17,810
Yes... Misa went between them to stop the
fight, but Nobukazu pushed her aside

121
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,814
she hit her head:on-ggpiller and
had to have 7 stitches on her forehead.

123
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:29,888
Misa became gloomy... and rested from
work at the hospital until she met Robert.

125
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,123
Robert?

126
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:36,795
The day of a landslide three years
ago, Misa accidentally found him.

128
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:42,401
He was caught in a landslide while
taking photos and was badly hurt.

130
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:46,237
Unfortunately, the hospital rooms were
filled that day.

132
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:49,842
Misa had no choice, so she had him
treated at the hospital and

134
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,378
brought him here and took care of him.

135
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,614
In the beginning she had a hard time
taking care of him.

137
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,651
The inside of Robert's mouth was
cut-up with the landslide

139
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,352
so he couldn't speak well.

140
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:06,792
Robert could speak Japanese, but it
seems he couldn't read or write it

142
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:10,663
and the conversation with Misa took
place on paper with roman letters

144
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,134
But, when Robert got better and
was able to talk

146
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,735
they seem to be enjoying things.

147
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,538
They told all sorts of jokes...

148
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:23,776
Japanese foods are delicious
especially on rainy days

150
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,711
dirt and sand are excellent"

151
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:30,349
I'm a prince of a certain country, and
I came to find a bride who is like light

153
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,653
By the time Robert's wounds had healed
and a farewell party was to be held

155
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:39,224
Ryuji and his family were home and
he became friends with them too

157
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,127
Misa also became bright again.

158
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,398
But, that makes it more confusing...

159
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,936
Wasn't it 2 or 3 days after Robert went
home when Misa committed suicider.

161
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:56,308
I don't really know, but after Robert
went home, Misa became gloomy again.

163
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:02,114
She suddenly disappeared and everyone
thought she ran away from home.

165
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:07,519
Yuzo is the one who found Misa dead
on thesecond floor of the storehouse.

167
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:11,056
Nd, several days later...

168
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:17,296
her mother, Kinuyo, also committed
suicide in the storehouse...

170
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:22,034
After the two died, was there anybody
who had a change in attitude?

172
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:29,007
Nobukazu came to the funeral
without tears or sad expression,

174
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,044
but on the other hand, Ryuji was
the one who was a big problem.

176
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:32,911
Huh?

177
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:38,016
He.cried in a voice so loud it echoed
throughout the neighborhood

179
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,687
The other would be Sae and Emi...

180
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,022
Oh, those twins...

181
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,826
Those two were such good friends with
Robert but...

183
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,263
2 years ago when they
came back to visit,

185
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,032
they suddenly
started saying something strange.

187
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,603
It was Robert...

188
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,938
Robert is the one who killed Misa...

189
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,473
Isn't it terrible...

190
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,841
Terrible, terrible...

191
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:07,279
But why did the children say something
Iike that?

193
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,451
I don't know... Mr. Negishi who came
to pick up the dolls was also surprised

195
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:17,322
Because after they talked to him, they
suddenly started saying those things.

197
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,491
What did they talk about

198
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:24,029
Well.... Mr. Negishi said they only
asked him his name

200
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:31,170
Hmmmmm... that's the Mr. Negishi who
died in the barn the other day.

202
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,505
Everyone was out to attend
to the neighborhood gathering.

204
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:38,976
Yoko came home ahead of the others to
prepare dinner and found him in the barn.

206
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:41,947
At that time, weren't you around?

207
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:47,252
Nobukazu and I were at the supermarket
buying the grocery for dinner.

209
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,821
With Nobukazu?

210
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:55,327
Yes, after his wife died, Nobukazu
took control of the-household money.

212
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:02,768
By the way the rope used to hang
Nobukazu and the string around him

214
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,436
can they be found in this storehouse?

215
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,806
Yes, for the string...

216
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:11,343
there's a'lot of it because it's used to
make the marionettes.

218
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:15,614
The ropes are in the barn
Would you like to go and see them?

220
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,284
Gee. it's raining hard

221
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:25,724
Hey, Kudo... Do you know who it is?
The murderer?

223
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,627
Not who the murderer
the sealed room trick

225
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,895
not a single lead...

226
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:33,699
After Nobukazu left the living room,
Robert went to the barn to get the car

228
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,868
and left with Ran and Kazuha

229
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:39,638
he didn't go near the storehouse even
once. It's impossible to be him.

231
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,941
Yoko, who was in the bath with the twins

232
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,978
and the housekeeper who was
cleaning up in the living room with us

234
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,147
and the old lady who was in her
room are also clean.

236
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,481
Yeah.

237
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:56,288
The ones that could have done anything
are Ryuji, the one making the bath

239
00:10:56,289 --> 00:11:00,659
And Yuzo, who was looking all over the
house for Nobukazu, those two

241
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:05,864
But something bugs me.
Something...

243
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,668
The string... isn't it?

244
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:15,641
Why did the murderer have to use the
string to make it look a curse?

246
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,643
It was a sealed room.

247
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:22,915
If he didn't do a thing like that, we would
have thought it was a suicide.

249
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:27,653
And, that request letter that was sent
to you also bothers me.

251
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,923
H... if that was sent by the murdere

252
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:34,259
IS he taking me lightly and
putting up a challenge?

254
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:40,098
This case, something fishy is running
behind it.

256
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,468
Let's see... the rope is...

257
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,872
Is somebod. there?!

258
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,308
Ran?!

259
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:54,178
What's that?! Kazuha is missing?!

260
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:55,414
Is she really?!

261
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:58,650
Only her penlight w
on the ground...

263
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:02,888
When I thought someone carried her off,
I panicked...

265
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,991
Anyway, let's split up and search for her!

266
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:06,658
Yes!

267
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,196
Kazuha! Where are you!

268
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,297
Hey!

269
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,231
Kazuha!

270
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,502
Hey! Have you found her?!

271
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,204
Nope... she's nowhere!

272
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,013
What's the matter? Hattori?!

273
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:32,351
The door to the storehouse
Isthought Irclosed it, but it's open!

275
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,260
This is...

276
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:46,698
Ka...Kazuha!!!

277
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,673
Kazuha!!

278
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,441
Hey! Get a hold of yourself. Kazuhat!!

279
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,678
Hey! Kazuha'!

280
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,914
Hel...

281
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,149
Kazuha!

282
00:13:06,184 --> 00:13:09,721
What*happened to me?

283
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:13,692
If I'm not mistaken... I was waiting
for Ran in front of the the storehouse, but...

285
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,594
I suddenly felt faint...

286
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,196
Be quiet! I'll cut you loose right now!

287
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,798
Kazuhat!

288
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,867
You don't have to worry .

289
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,503
Looks like you were just hanging with
the strings.

291
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:27,272
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Kazuha!

292
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:31,777
I didn't search hard enough, and got
youlinto this terrible situation.

294
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,779
Then the mascot?

295
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,983
I'm sorry... I found it! It was
caught in the cover of the CD player.

297
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,253
I'm really sorry... if I had taken a
closer look...

299
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:45,524
I'm glad you found it...
on't lose it again

301
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,491
Okay!

302
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,962
Hey, Hattori.

303
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,664
Oh yes! I know!

304
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,100
Old man! Please take care of Kazuha!

305
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,034
Huh? What?

306
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,970
Don't you see?

307
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:03,108
He tried to use our blind-spot by hanging
Kazuha up in the storehouse

309
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,677
we were in a while ago.

310
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:11,049
After we left, he brought Kazuha here
and wrapped her in the strings

312
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,452
then all he/had to do was put that rope
around her neck

314
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,320
and the curse would be completed!

315
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,890
There's only one reason
why he had to stop!

317
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:24,596
The murderer noticed my footsteps when I
ran overhere, and he left in a hurry.

319
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,097
Which means,

320
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,832
Which means,

321
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:31,636
The murderer is still
in this storehouse!!!

323
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,112
Hey, Kudo! Are my deductions wrong?

324
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,848
No, nothing' s wrong

325
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:47,586
Then, let's have a look at the
murderer's face!!

327
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,860
Hey, is he around?

328
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:55,794
Nope...

329
00:14:56,095 --> 00:15:01,333
That' strange... it hasn't been 3 minutes
since we came to this storehouse.

331
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:05,937
We were guarding the entrance on the
first floor so there's no placexto hide!

333
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:09,674
The only place to escape from would
be that tiny window

335
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,676
Is it really possible?

336
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:15,547
Is there a way to get out from there
in such a short time?

338
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,452
What!! This time that girl from
Osaka was attacked?!

340
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:20,685
What!! This time that girl from
Osaka was attackedr.!

342
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,754
By who?

343
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,322
I don't know!

344
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:29,895
Kazuha is resting in the room right now,
but she may remember in time

346
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:33,932
one of the faces among you!

347
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,435
One reason we had you gather here is

348
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,905
to prevent anymore murders
from taking place

350
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:43,942
and the other is to confirm your alibis!

351
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:49,114
Alibis? We were asleep in our
rooms all this time.

353
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,715
It's the same for me.

354
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:54,886
I was in my room too, but I wasn't asleep .

355
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:59,524
Where were you? I didn't see you when
we were searching.

357
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,227
I was searching outside the house

358
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:06,231
In other words, everyone doesn't have
an alibi

360
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,632
You're kidding...

361
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,869
Yuzo isn't arou

362
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,639
Oh, if it's Yuzo, wouldn't he be in
the workshop?

364
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,645
I was here working all the time

365
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:25,584
I was putting the finishing touches on the
doll Brother had to complete by tomorrow.

367
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:30,055
Mmmmm. you can make dolls too

368
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:34,693
Three years ago, my company went
bankrupt and I came back home

370
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:42,734
Brother taught me all sorts of things
and let me do the simple constructions.

372
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:46,404
Three years ago... that's the time of
that incident?

374
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:51,476
Yes, I came home just
after Robert had left

376
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:57,148
But I wasn't allowed to make fixtures
or do repairs.

378
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:03,755
Brother's marionettes cost $10,000 a piece
and he charged $7.000 for repairs.

380
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,525
He sold them for $10,000 and repaired
them for $7,000?

382
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,262
Can he do business like that?

383
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:16,101
Yes. . seems like there are some people
who request repairs more than 10 times.

385
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:20,704
He charged quite a bit for
the marionettes.

387
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:28,113
With the money he saved, he often
went abroad with Mr. Negishi to play

389
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:35,153
After leaving the sales of the dolls to Mr
Negishi, they began to sell at high prices

391
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,424
Hey... what's that big doll?

392
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:45,030
Oh, that's the marionette
of the "spider empresssn

394
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:49,467
When Father was alive, dolls of
that size were used at every festival

396
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:55,339
to do plays of the "spider empress
but the number of people able to

398
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,712
handle dolls that big gradually disappeared
and they quit doing it...

400
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:03,481
What are those boxes that are
stacked up?

402
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:08,920
It's the dolls that Mr. Negishi wa
suppose to take that day.

404
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:15,060
After Mr. Negishi died, Brother
realized that he was one doll short.

406
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:22,567
The customer called directly and he
had to make one more.

408
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,570
Anyway

409
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,707
please stay in the room everyone is
gathered In.

411
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,642
It's dangerous to be by yourself.

412
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,876
Sure...

413
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,213
Alright, now's our chance!

414
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:38,450
The repair fees for the dolls
are extremel high

416
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:43,221
Despite the price, there are customers
who request repairs more than 10 times.

418
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:47,892
A simple puppet that's
expensive means

420
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:52,329
What's inside is probably...
« narcotics!!

422
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:55,433
As for the marionettes

423
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:02,640
you can only put the narcotics in
the head so the price is cheaper!

425
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:07,145
I've got it! Now I know the reason
why Nobukazu called a detective

427
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,147
to find out who the murderer is.

428
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,952
A large part of the entire picture
has come into view.

430
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,789
What's left that we don't know is the
the sealed-room trick and

432
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,892
why Kazuha had to be attacked...

433
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,661
Sae! Emi!

434
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,297
What is it... what's the matter?

435
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,701
The two daughters I brought to the
restroom aren't here!

437
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:30,735
What's that?

438
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,537
Mother...

439
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,908
Ohhhh... you worried me!

440
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:40,078
Didn't I tell you to wait in front of
the restroom when you were through!!

442
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,547
But, there was a smell!

443
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,616
There sure was... a funny smell!

444
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,585
It's probably the spider children
burning in the furnace!

446
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,920
They're burning!

447
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,688
Grandmother said so, didn't she...

448
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,156
She did! She did!

449
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,658
The furnace??

450
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,733
It's true, there's something strange
burning in here...

452
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:06,104
Hey, come to think of it... what was
the meaning of that?

454
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:06,738
Huh?

455
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:10,575
You said it, didn't you?
You called Robert "murderer"

457
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,644
The day Robert was leaving,

458
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,713
Misa told us to go and ask him what his
feelings were

460
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,749
so we went to the bus stop!

461
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,953
We asked him, "how do you feel about Misa?"

462
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,223
Then, Robert wrote a terrible thing
down on paper!

464
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,156
Didn't he!

465
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:27,692
A terrible thing?

466
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,594
He wrote, "die!"

467
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:30,728
Die?

468
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,098
It's terrible!
Terrible, te rible

470
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,033
Don't let it bother you

471
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,635
The children probably saw wrong.

472
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,672
I shouldn't have shown that name card.

473
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,474
Name card?

474
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:47,479
Let's see... I'm sure I have it here...
this is it!

476
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,454
They. found this name card inside the
wallet and made a lot of noise.

478
00:20:57,455 --> 00:21:01,759
« hey asked, "who did: you get this
from?" "where is this person?"

480
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,428
Look at this!

481
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,098
I got it out somehow!

482
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,900
Hey, this is...

483
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,034
You're kidding...

484
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,805
Isn't it a stungun?!

485
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,941
Kazuha!

486
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,511
Oh, Heiji! I feel much better now...

487
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,146
Take off your clothes!

488
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:22,012
Huh?

489
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:24,115
Just let me see!

490
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,316
What're you doing!!

491
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,751
Wait a minute Conan!

492
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,723
Why am I the only one to get hit!

493
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,391
Well... I'm a child.

494
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,361
T's here...

495
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:39,230
small burn marks on her back

496
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,901
She was knocked out with a stungun
after all! And?

498
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,969
Did she say anything else?

499
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,871
She didn't see the murderer,

500
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,641
but she said she found a strange ball
in front of the storehouse §

502
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:50,708
Ball?

503
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,678
She said that it was a ball about
this small.

505
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,880
BB-shot!

506
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,216
That's it!

507
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,884
There was that method!

508
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,618
If that's so...

509
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:02,887
That thing...

510
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,923
Should be somewhere...

511
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:05,323
In this room!

512
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:06,257
In this room!

513
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,527
I found it! Hattori, it's here!

514
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,529
The marks of a thumbtack!

515
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,364
I've found it too!!

516
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,368
Strange string with loops on
the beam ends!

518
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,239
It's just as we thought, isn't it!

519
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:22,406
Yeah!

520
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:28,346
There's no mistake... that person is
the murderer!!!
