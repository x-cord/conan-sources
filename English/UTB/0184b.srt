1
00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:02,268
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,936
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:06,005
deductions take all shapes and styles
in each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,006
Today is a special of a cursed mask.

6
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:10,409
A mysterious room and an eerie smile.

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,878
He sees through the one and only truth.

8
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,679
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

10
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,950
no case is left unsolved when
Detective Conan comes to the scene.

12
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,748
The Masks Smile Callously

13
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,618
The messenger of the cursed masks...

14
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,089
Why didn't youlreport it to the police

15
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,624
when you first found this letter?

16
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,361
Well, the victim, Ms. Suou
mentioned that she had been receiving

18
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:11,430
similar pranks for some time,
and to not worry about it...

20
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,101
So, these are the cursed masks...

21
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:15,768
Yes...

22
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:20,573
We heard a groan and a loud crash.

23
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,909
It could've been the sound of the Killer
scattering the masks.

25
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:28,381
You said that this door was
Iocked from inside?

27
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,249
Yes, that's why

28
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:33,418
I cracked the glass above the door,
made Conan go inside

30
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,588
and verified Ms. Suou's death.

31
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,823
The door was definitely locked.

32
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,658
All two doors were locked...

33
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:40,926
wo doors...

35
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,131
Ms. Suou always locked
both locks on her door.

37
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,000
His door lock...

38
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,070
and then this padlock...

39
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,607
Why did the victim have
two locks on her door?

41
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,710
Well, according to her secretary,
Ms. Inaba...

43
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:02,081
when Ms. Suou went to have the curse of
the masks sealed in by a clairvoyant,

45
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,850
she was told to carry out several things.

46
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:10,990
One of them was to put two locks
Nn the bedroom door...

48
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,059
clairvoyant, eh...

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,865
Which means that the victim herself,
opened the door and let the victim in...?

51
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,802
Well, it doesn't seem so

52
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:23,602
Hmm...?

53
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,772
It seems that Ms. Suou was suffering
from insomnia lately,

55
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,007
and was taking sleeping pills.

56
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,812
That's why there were no traces of
the victim having struggled?!

58
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:38,417
If the victim locked the door as usual
drank sleeping pills and went to bed,

60
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,886
how did the killer get into the room...?

61
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,289
Hmm, what IS this door .

62
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,092
There us a bedroom next door too,

63
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,628
but that door seems to have been
closed off for many years.

65
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,430
It seems to be nailed shut,

66
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,432
and there are no traces of
it having been opened.

68
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:58,370
The railing above the door,
is that bar removable?

70
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,907
I checked on it, but it was not.

71
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,243
The space between the bars is
about 5 or 6 centimeters,

73
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,778
so not even an arm can go through.

74
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,247
How about that window
on the other side?

76
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,382
That window is fixed on.

77
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,184
There Is nothing abnormal about it.

78
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:17,123
If so, how and where did the killer
go in and out of this room?

80
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:21,994
The only door that could be opened
and shut, was locked from the inside.

82
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,598
'Lihe door to the-bedroom next door
IS nailed and sealed.

84
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,199
The space between the bars above it,

85
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,602
isso-nanrow-that
not even an arm can get through.

87
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,403
The windows are both fixed on

88
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,072
and there-seems-to be
nothing wrong with them.

90
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:36,408
It's also impossible for the victim herself
to have opened the door

92
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,145
and let the killer in, because she was
under the effect of sleeping pills.

94
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,515
The room is a locked room,
where you can't get in or get out of!

96
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,585
I wonder if Ms. Suou really drank
the sleeping pill herself?

98
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:47,987
Huh?

99
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:50,523
If she didn't drink it herself,
who would make her...

101
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,991
uh? Wait a sec...

102
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,593
I've got it, Inspector!!

103
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,061
What?! Is that true?!

104
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:59,265
The killer met Ms. Suou
in the middle of the night,

106
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,600
made her drink something
with.a'sleeping- pill in-it,

108
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,835
put her to sleep...

109
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:06,338
Then, the killer carries Ms. Suou to her
bed on the bed and kills her there!

111
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:07,406
I see!

112
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,076
And, how did the killer lock the door
when leaving the room?!

114
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,012
OO. Oh well...

115
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,481
I don't know just yet!

116
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:16,482
VAgh...

117
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:21,420
only half of the locked room mystery
can be.explained...

119
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:26,659
The door is the only possible way
that the killer could've come in from,

121
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,362
but how on earth did the killer lock
the door from the outside?

123
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,665
If the lock were just a handle
that could be turned,

125
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,766
then using a string or something
may unlock it...

127
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,769
But, the padlock ls the problem.

128
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,805
In order to lock this,
the door has to be closed first.

130
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,908
Then the door and the metal piece
on the door frame has to be matched.

132
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,376
Only after doing so,

133
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,646
can the pole be stuck into
the two metal fixtures.

135
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,984
I feel that it is impossible to do all this
rom outside the door...

137
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,987
What kind of trick
did the killer use anyway...?

139
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,457
- Â» Tas
O Ira er wa IC - e 1 er use

141
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,093
why didn't the killer
make it look like a suicide,

143
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,996
ter doing all this to kill her...

144
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,266
The killer called our room
just before the murder was committed...

146
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:11,870
As if to let us know beforehand
that murder was going to take place...

148
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,873
This knife seems to be
the murder weapon.

150
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,010
This is what was decorated
in the room of the masks.

152
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:22,581
It was poked into the bed pole,
but there's something odd...

154
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:26,451
As you can see, the handle of it is also
smeared with blood

156
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,587
It sure is odd...

157
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:32,458
If the killer is holding the handle,
there should be no blood there...

159
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,059
Talking of blood,

160
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:37,796
there were masks among the masks
that were scattered on the floor

162
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,999
with blood splattered on them too.

163
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,270
This was found on the bed.

164
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,473
It seems to have been splattered
with blood at close range.

166
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,042
I think that the killer was wearing
this mask

168
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,944
when committing the murder...

169
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:56,548
If so, there may be some traces of
the Killer left...

171
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,951
Are there other masks
that have been splattered with blood?

173
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,355
Yes, but it's quite strange...

174
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:08,427
All the other masks had blood
nly around the mouth...

176
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,697
There is a spook story
concerning the masks

178
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,501
that says the masks sip the blood of
the people who own them...

180
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,569
Don't be silly...

181
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,906
Could the killer have scattered the masks

182
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,576
to confuse investigations
with occult stories?

184
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,979
That's most likely...

185
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,883
I wonder if that's the only reason why
the killer scattered the masks?

187
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:34,186
No, I'm sure there is some other reason.

188
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,854
If I could only figure that out.

189
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,855
Inspector!

190
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,325
Oh, Officer Kobayashi, how was it?

191
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,594
We checked ever nook and crann
surrounding the mansion,

193
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,997
but maybe because of the snow
that has accumulated,

195
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,599
there are no signs of
the killer having gone in or out!

197
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,202
Which means that the killer us...

198
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,870
A person that is within the mansion...!

199
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,139
Aside from Mr. Mouri and his family,

200
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,674
those who were insthis mansion are

201
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,344
camera man, Masanori Katagiri,

202
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,214
pro baseball player, Mamoru Matsudaira,

203
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,484
popular Fortune-teller, Haruka Nagara,

204
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:09,088
rock singer, Touya Aikawa,

205
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,691
the victim's secretary, Kazuyo Inaba,

206
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:16,161
and the twin maids,
Minaho and Honami Shimogasa.

208
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:18,764
A total of 7 people

209
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,267
We can narrow down
the suspects a bit more.

211
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:23,869
What do you mean?

212
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,303
111]

214
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:27,606
You can't get to Ms. Suou's bedroom
which is on the 3rd floor,

216
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,742
without using the stairs of the west wing.

220
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,477
At the time-of the incident,

221
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:35,147
the doors leading to the east and west
wings were both locked.

223
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,015
This has already been verified.

224
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,250
In other words,

225
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,887
you couldn't pass from the east wing
to the west wing at that time.

227
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,589
Which means that the killer is someone

228
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,324
who was in the west wing
of the mansiong,

230
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,726
Who were in what rooms?

231
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,995
First, on the 1st floor of the east wing,

232
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,563
were Mr. Aikawa and Honami

234
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,264
In the west wing

237
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:52,865
In the west wing

239
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:53,899
were Ms. Inaba and Minaho.

242
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,668
On the 2nd floor east wing were we three,
2nd Floor

245
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,372
in the west wing, were
Mr. Katagiri, Mr. Matsudaira and Haruka.
2nd Floor

249
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,909
There are 5 sus

250
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,678
Mr. Katagiri, Mr. Matsudaira, Ms. Nagara,

251
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,115
Ms. Inaba and Minaho

252
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,585
Yes, the messenger of the cursed masks

253
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,687
are amongethe five...!

254
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,323
H...everyon

255
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,558
I hate to have to do this,
knowing how tired you all must be,

257
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,262
but I'd like to ask you a few questions.

258
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,564
The incident occurred,

259
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,433
in the wee hours of the
morning at around 2:30.

261
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,970
Please tell me in order, what you
were doing at that time.

263
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,839
First, Honami?

264
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:38,777
I was fast asleep in my room until
Ran came to wake me

266
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,848
You got the key and
headed for the 2nd floor?

268
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,783
Where do you keep the key?

269
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,920
On the kitchen wall that
Is next to this dining room

271
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,255
So anybody could take
it and use it at will?

273
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:54,259
But, the key was
definitely there at that time

275
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,260
Ran?

276
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,896
She's right.

277
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,231
Are there any spare keys?

278
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,801
They are old keys, so
we canst make spares.

280
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:06,305
When we unlocked the door
and went into the room of masks

282
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,475
we noticed that the masks of
Chableu were gone.

284
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:14,379
That was when we heard the
groan and loud noise from the 3rd floor

286
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,485
Yes, and while we were waking Minaho on
the extension phone,

288
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,553
Aikawa came along.

289
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,755
I was sleeping in my room on
the 1st floor too

291
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:28,159
I realized that they had come to
wake Minaho but,

293
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,363
I didn't think it was a big deal.

294
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,999
Then, it started getting noisy,

295
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,301
so I went to the 2nd
floor to check things out

297
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:39,872
I was awakened by Honami
on the extension phone,

299
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,673
took the key and went to the 2nd floor.

300
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,343
I was also sleeping
in my room, but since it

302
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:47,212
started to get noisy outside,
I got up and went out

304
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,382
into the corridor, just as
Minaho had come up the stairs.

306
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,052
Same with me

307
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:55,921
Me too...

308
00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:00,859
Ms. Inaba, I heard that you did not appear
at the time the corpse was found?

310
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:05,898
I over drank wine last night
and was totally passed out.

312
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,867
So, you didn't realize
all the racket going on?

314
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,601
N.No...

315
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,707
Oh, Mr. Katagiri, have you ever
met Ms. Suou before?

317
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,110
No, I met her for the first time yesterday.

318
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,211
Why?

319
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,181
Ms. Suou asked me to check on the traffic

320
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,151
accident that took your
wife's life 20 years ago.

322
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,555
Huh, Ms. Suou did? Why?

323
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,123
Do you have any idea why?

324
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,225
No, I don't

325
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,662
Ms. Suou asked Pops to check on the

326
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,830
traffic accident that took
Mr. Katagiri's wife's life?

328
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,401
Why would she want to check on a traffic
accident that happened 20 years ago?

330
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,139
Your mother got into a traffic accident

331
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,441
twenty years ago too,
didn't she, Mr. Aikawa?

333
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,544
Huh? Yeah, that's right

334
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,445
Huh? Don't tell me that?!

335
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,613
Mr. Katagin?!

336
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:58,050
Will you tell us about the traffic
accident that took your wife's life?

338
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:03,488
You'll find out sooner or later
even if I didn't tell you

340
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,292
Yes, my wife was the
victim of the traffic accident

342
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,461
that Mr. Aikawa's mother had caused

343
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,496
OO. Oh no

344
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,499
Didn't you know about it, Mr. Aikawa?

345
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:18,202
No...because I was still only six years old

346
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:22,507
But, how is that traffic accident
connected to today's murder case?

348
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,677
The police think that
the murderer is among

350
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,312
us, isn't that right?

351
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:27,946
What?!

352
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,849
Oh no! Is that true, Inspector?!!

353
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,351
Oh, no, not really...

354
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,522
I recall that it had
stopped snowing after 12:00

356
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:41,058
I'll bet you couldn't find
traces of the killer on the snow?

358
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,594
Ugh...

359
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,231
Is she right, Inspector?!

360
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,568
It can't be helped

361
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,837
Yes, it's true that there are

362
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,172
no traces of the killer
having entered or left the mansion

364
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,207
Oh no...

365
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,176
You mean the killer is among us?

366
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:02,114
Moreover, since the room of masks was
Iocked, the killer has to be one of the five

368
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,851
that was in the west wing!

369
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:13,592
Mr. Katagiri, Haruka, Ms Inaba,
Mr. Matsudaira and Minaho

372
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:18,196
null; vvdit d sel tidL wWdo d slidiiye
remark.

374
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,298
Why that remark?

375
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,835
But, it's difficult to determine the suspect.

376
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,805
I think there is a way.

377
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,474
Don't tell me that you're
going to find the killer

379
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,376
using your cards, are you?

380
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,712
From the looks of the scene of the crime,

381
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:36,848
killer probably was
splattered by a lot of blood.

383
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,885
Although it is possible to avoid blood
on the face by wearing the mask,

385
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:43,588
it would not be as easy remove the
blood from the hair and body.

387
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:47,893
I see! The killer is someone who had time
to wipe the blood that splattered on, off!

389
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,963
W., What?! Are you saying
that I'm the killer?!

391
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,067
The only person who had
time to wipe blood off

393
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,235
IS you, because you
weren't at the scene where

395
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,037
the body was found

396
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,872
You've got to be kidding!

397
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,808
Why would I have to kill Ms. Suou?!

398
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,711
Hey, you!

399
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:05,976
Agh!!

400
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:06,344
Agh!!

401
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,113
Cut out your nonsense!

402
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,281
Please calm down!

403
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,615
You fraud fortune-teller!!

404
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:11,717
Agh!!

405
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,969
That's what happene

406
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:36,341
I was completely deceived
by the trap that the killer had set

408
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,278
But, the trick's over!

409
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,915
I've figured out...the curse of the masks!

410
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,989
Huh? What's up, Conan?

411
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,860
Mr. Mouri says he has a favor to ask you.

412
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:55,093
Huh...?

413
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:55,727
Huh...?

414
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:00,132
What is it? Hey, what?

415
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,268
On the chest over there. Take a look at it!

416
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,737
What a nuisance...

417
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:14,379
There's nothing h

418
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,054
Leave the rest to me, Pops

419
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:34,065
So, this is the bedroom next door...

420
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:40,071
So a bedroom that looks
just like Ms. Suou's was right next door

422
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,941
This room, with the same structure

423
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,876
as that of the room
where the crime took place,

425
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,611
is what helped solved
the mystery of the locked doors

427
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,614
as well as reveal the identity of the killer.

428
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,018
What? You mean
Ms. Inaba is not the killer?

430
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,486
I've been saying that I'm not!!

431
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,955
Have you solved the
mystery of the locked doors?!

433
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,157
Yes, I've figured everything out.

434
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,993
Who on earth is the killer?!

435
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:05,931
The killer who killed
Ms. Beniko Suou in a locked room

437
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:08,033
Messenger of the Cursed Mask" is

438
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,404
you!!

439
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,310
The "Messenger of the Cursed Mask" is

440
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:19,411
You!

441
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,546
Mr. Touya Aikawa!!

442
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,449
What?

443
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,450
NO...

444
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:26,818
Oh no...?!

445
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,588
WwW. What on earth are you
talking about, Mr. Mourn?

447
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,390
How could I, who was
in the east wing of the

449
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,759
mansion have gone to
Ms. Suou's bedroom?

451
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:39,231
Yes, it's true that you
could not go to Ms. Suou's bedroom

453
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,633
In order to prove that

454
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:46,504
You called us on the extension phone,
just before you committed the murder!

456
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,574
But, if he couldn't go to her':bedroom,

457
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,443
how could he have committed the crime?

458
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,413
I've been suspicious
from the time the body was found.

460
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,250
I kept thinking of why the Killer,
despite having committed the crime

462
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,251
behind a locked door,

463
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,787
did not make her death look to be suicide.

464
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,124
It was because he couldn't

465
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,460
Mr. Aikawa

466
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:13,131
killed Ms. Suou without
entering her bedroom at all!

468
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,066
WwW, what?!

469
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,168
Without going into her bedroom...?

470
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,905
Phooey, impossible...

471
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:24,643
It's possible, with the help
of the cursed masks

473
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:30,482
D,Don't tell me that you really believe in
things such as curses?

475
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,185
No. But the masks of Chableu are indeed

476
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,522
the key to committing murder
behind locked doors.

478
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,659
I will replay that method here.

479
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:42,060
Officer Takagi!!

480
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:42,727
Yes sir!

481
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:43,595
Huh?!

482
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,169
I borrowed a knife that
Is similar to the murder weapon.

484
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,506
There is a rubber rope attached through
the hole at the rear end of the handle

486
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,374
Next for the mask.

487
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,644
The rubber rope is passed through
both eyes of all the masks

489
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,280
And the rubber rope attached to the knife is

490
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:06,151
passed through the
mouth hole of all the masks.

492
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,454
After all of us went to bed, Mr. Aikawa

493
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:13,525
went to the kitchen to get the key
to enter the room of masks.

495
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,127
He stole the masks of Chableu and a knife

496
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:19,731
en OC G 8 OOI an
returned the key to the kitchen.

498
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,168
He brought the masks
and knife into this room,

500
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,870
and carried on with the rubber rope trick.

501
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,406
He dropped the masks and the knife into

502
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,208
Ms. Suou's bedroom through
the space between the railing

504
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,843
The size of the space is 5X5 centimeters.

505
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,713
A thin mask would easily slide through.

506
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,950
Can you really solve the mystery of the
Iocked door doing something like this?

508
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,553
Well, please watch.

510
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,904
This is the last mask!

511
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,809
After placing all the masks inside the room

512
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,012
he pulled the rubber
rope towards himself

514
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,069
Now everyone, since
the mask is 15 millimeters thick,

516
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,304
if 200 are piled up one
on top of the other,

518
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,739
the pile would be 3 meters.

519
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,776
The position of the neck of the victim
asleep in bed was about

521
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,745
3 meters and a half from the railing

522
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,947
So, then what...

523
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,249
Aaagh!!

524
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,991
Whaaa!!

525
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:09,541
From the edge of the knife to the
victim's throat is only 10 centimeters.

527
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,912
All he had left to do now, was to push
the masks out using a ruler or something

529
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:21,519
By using these stairs that only the people

530
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,989
who are in the east wing
of the mansion can climb

532
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,095
Mr. Aikawa killed Ms. Suou
without setting foot into her room at all.

534
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:34,866
I see! One of the masks
was badly covered blood because

536
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,535
it was the mask on the very top,
wasn't it?!

538
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,872
The reason why several masks
had blood by the mouth,

540
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,141
was because Ms. Suou's
splattered on them

542
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:46,511
And he finally severs the rubber rope
that was passed through the eyes

544
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,880
of the masks and the handle of the knife.

545
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,053
His is...

546
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,226
So, that's it for the locked door mystery!

547
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,663
It's all baloney! Just where do you
have the proof that I used that trick!

549
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:09,267
Mr. Aikawa, you're acting in bad grace

550
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:15,306
Haven't you realized that you've already
confessed that you are the killer?

552
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,842
What the?! What do you mean...?!

553
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,745
While you were being
questioned a while ago,

555
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,981
you said,

556
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:27,185
I noticed that the kids came
to wake Honami up.

558
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:31,156
Yeah, because I was in my
room on the first floor then!

560
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,692
When you said, "Those kids" who
and Ran were you referring to?

562
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,828
Who else but the kid named Conan!

563
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,297
Huh, how strange.

564
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,400
I didn't say a word back then,

565
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,502
and yet how did you know I was with Ran? WW

566
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:50,642
Right, I opened the door a
bit and looked out.

568
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:53,444
That's why I know that he was with her!

569
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,213
Really?

570
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:56,714
Really!

571
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,217
Then, it's even stranger.

572
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,620
Because I didn't go with Ran

573
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,224
I went to check if the doors
around the house were locked!

575
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,791
OO, Oh no...

576
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,761
Is that true?!

577
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:10,295
Y. Yes

578
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,732
I went to Honami's room alone

579
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:21,239
I did tell Ran and Conan to go get
Honami back then.

581
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,177
Didn't you think that they
went together to Honami's room

583
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,380
because when you heard me say so,
you were in the room in the 3rd floor?

585
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,117
Only because of something like
that. ..you.

587
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,954
Touya! After all she did for you,
how could you!

589
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,024
Shut up! After all she did for me?

590
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,192
You've got to be kidding!

591
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,296
That lady blamed the hit-and-run accident
that she caused on my mother,

593
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,699
and made it look as if
she committed suicide!

595
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,500
Is that true?!

596
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:53,771
It's true! Although I found out
about it just 2 months ago.

598
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:56,374
I was cleaning out my
mother's belongings

600
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,077
when a letter fell out from
behind the cover of her diary

602
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,945
and the truth about the incident was
ritten in it...

604
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:04,682
That's a he! It's all baloney!

605
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:08,620
No it's not! Mother had an alibi!

606
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,857
The accident occurred on the
night of October 31st

608
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,027
October 31...

609
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,495
Touya s birthday...

610
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:21,799
Right! Mother was with
me right through on that day!

612
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,470
Which means that the one who
hit-and-ran my wife

614
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,238
was Suou

615
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,642
Moreover, she didn't even
know that your wife

617
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:33,578
was the victim of a
traffic accident, Mr. Katagiri!

619
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:37,382
I guess she asked me
to investigate on the case,

621
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:40,218
after she heard Mr. Katagiri
talk about it at dinner.

623
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:44,389
Ms. Suou is a fine person who has
been hosting charity shows for 15: years!

625
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,291
What a laugh!

626
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:50,495
That lady embezzled the money
that was raised to fatten her own pocket!

628
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:52,597
Mw That's a lie! Ms. Suou wollldinever
do any such thing!

630
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,600
You also got part of the cash, didn't you!

631
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,902
You're not playing dumb with me!

632
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:04,208
I wanted to keep Mr. Katagiri
from participating in this corrupt charity

634
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,077
no matter what

635
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,046
That Lady

636
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:11,949
Beniko Suou was a devil wearing
the mask of person practicing good will!

638
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:16,320
Just to think that I felt grateful
for her having saved me, all these years

It could be that Mr. Aikawa was
possessed by the curse of the masks.

684
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,822
Curses are only superstitions!

685
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:15,373
Curse! This is a curse...!

686
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,812
That's no curse, Pops,
it's just that you're a klutz
