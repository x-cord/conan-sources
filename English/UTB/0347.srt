1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:03,702
Friendship. Romance. M"stery

3
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:05,471
ecause we cerisa ; em we can con inue

4
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,406
The hint lies with Ayumi and Genta

5
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,041
The key lies in the car

6
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,843
He sees through the one and only truth,

7
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,611
A child in appearance
with the IQ. of an adult

9
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:15,214
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

12
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,716
On the way back from school in the rain,

13
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,718
Ayumi bumps into a street
ripper:on the run.

15
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,123
She didn't get to see his face but

16
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,924
the mark of what most likely was from that

17
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,494
of the belongings-of the culprit that
resembled the number "5

19
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,162
was left on-the palm of her hand.

20
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:13,465
And the same mark was also, found
on Genta's rear end

22
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:18,153
D.Don't tell me that it's?!

23
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:20,839
This!! This mark!!

24
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,408
A blood stained shape of a key was
on the sleeve of Ayumi's clothes

26
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:26,178
This serves as proof that the culprit
grabbed the key with hands soiled

28
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,113
with the blood of the victim and fled!

29
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:31,083
So. that.he could drive away
on his. car immediately

31
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,085
and flee as far away as he, can.

32
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,421
This means that the culprit
will not show the police the key,

34
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,557
which he knows will
display haematological. response!!

36
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:48,900
(13 ha)

37
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,503
Huh? Only three?

38
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:55,040
A.Are you serious? Inspector Megure!

39
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:55,641
Yeah...

40
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,007
Yeah...

41
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:56,507
Yeah...

42
00:02:56,508 --> 00:02:58,260
One that was stopped at the checkpoint

43
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,847
and two others that were driving
around in the vicinity!

45
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,882
They're the only ones who
are residents that live in the vicinit

47
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:07,319
have no alibi and who are saying that
they've lost their master keys...

49
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:13,692
I'm going to have the three people
go over to you right now...

51
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,629
If you got alimpse of the street ripper,
I'd like you to make a confirmation too!

53
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,331
Yes. sir'I understand

54
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,602
The:three suspects are on their way
here right now!

56
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,670
\ ell

57
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,005
It's as if we've already
arrested the culprit!

59
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,076
Ayumi heard the culprit's voice...

60
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,947
So. he'll probably go pale
when he sees her!

62
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,682
Yup. I'm sure!!

63
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,584
I'll do my best!!

64
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,152
I'm against it.

65
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,153
Huh?...

66
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,990
It the culprit is really among the three.

67
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:48,961
You meet him and he gets arrested,
that's fine...

69
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:52,631
But what if he's acquitted
because of lack of evidence?

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,902
The culprit's going to hold a grudge
»n you for putting him in a fix

73
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,439
come after you and
may take revenge on-you one day!

75
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,843
If he's a street ripper who's killing people
at random the more so.

77
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,513
Y.You're taking your imagination too far,

79
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,448
I'm trying to say.

80
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,652
Don't go taking a reckless risk when there
isn't sufficient evidence yet!

82
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,557
But; I'm the one who saw the culprit
at the closets range.

84
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:23,462
So I may be able to tell who the culprit is
if you make them wear raincoats, right?

86
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,198
You can confirm that just looking
at pictures too. right?

88
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,434
As for the voice,
you can listen to the recorded voice

90
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,837
There's no need to go any further and
Ieave a stronger impression

92
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,506
on the culprit than you already have.

93
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:40,045
Just as Al's pointing out,
it's too risky to meet the culprit directly.

95
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:46,718
But, it's vexing to let the three suspects go
off just like that-after questioning them too

97
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,987
There's no guarantee. that
theydl be no more victims either.

99
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,124
Maybe it's better to just keep a distance
and peek in secretly for now. huh?

101
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,610
Okay. this way. this. way.

102
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,730
Stop!

103
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,802
Please get out of the car one by one

104
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,671
tell me your name and what you do.

105
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,273
Please also tell me
where and what youwere doing

107
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,808
at the time of the crime. around 14:00.

108
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,076
First, from.you.at the far left.

109
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:17,316
Ghads. I came here voluntarily,
and you treat me. like I'm the culprit.

111
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,584
I'm Hiroshi Enomoto.

112
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,421
I'm a university student working
part-time at a sushi shop on 3-chome!

114
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:25,223
Did you buy this car with the money
you made from working part-time?

116
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,360
No. ..l leeched off my parents.

117
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,227
Bug your:

118
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:31,797
I see...

119
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,567
If throughi:smoked glass,
they can't see"us from their side.

121
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:40,205
And. does the voice of that man
sound familiar?

124
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:44,609
it-sounds-familiar and:yet:doesn:t...

125
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:46,411
It's my day off today.

126
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,414
Last night my boss blasted me
so I was feelin bummed out

129
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:53,218
and decided to get it off my chest
by going to the mountains,

131
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,987
when I was nabbed at the checkpoint.

132
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,622
You were going to the-mountains
to get it off your chest?

134
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:01,560
Well, the scenery in that area is nice,
so I feel refreshed...

136
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,030
No wonder the body of the car is soiled
and full of scratches

138
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,165
Next! You. in the middle!

139
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,968
Oh, yes...

140
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,470
He...
Don't you go banging my car around!!

142
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,305
He...
Don't you go banging my car around!!

144
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,439
1. mm sorry...

145
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:20,112
I'm not really:good at driving...

146
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,114
but I'm good making repairs

147
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,116
Which means you work as a...

148
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,886
Oh, yes...l work at
a automobile repair factory.

150
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,588
My name is Naokazu Fukuchi.

151
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:34,326
The factory is closed today
but my car was not in the best condition,

153
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,995
so I was confined in the factory
from morning repairing it.

155
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:41,933
But, there are reports of
you being seen driving;around town...

157
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,736
4 was just.driving around
the shopping arcade to check

159
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,872
if the car was totally repaired!

160
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,273
Is.ls anything wrong with that?!

161
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,540
Oh. no...

162
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:50,141
Oh. no...

163
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:52,811
Next.

164
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,413
Yeah...

165
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,683
My name:s-Toshiaki:Degawa.

166
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,552
I'm a locksmith.and my'shop"s located
onifiéchomezén

168
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:07,826
How wretched of me despite
being a locksmith, to lose master key.

170
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:13,432
Your car, unlike the other two
IS sure nice and shiny.

172
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,568
Yeah,
I go get a car wash each time I go out.

174
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,571
This car is my heart and soul. you know.

175
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,274
Which means you went out
this afternoon too?

177
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,643
I gotiarcallisaying that
the client:lostiher house key

179
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,445
and wanted me:itoiunliock the door.

180
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,713
But, sinceSheididn't explain
her address very well,

182
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:32,384
I was goingiiaround in circles
ookingifor the house.

184
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,287
I didn't get to see her at all, however,

185
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,223
because she called to tell me that
her boyfriend who had a spare key came,

187
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,825
so that I didn't have to go...

189
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,161
Did anything dawn
on you so far?

191
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,896
Nothing at all...

192
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,232
They're not shouting besides...

193
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,835
All three of them are about the same
height and have the same kind of physique

195
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,837
Hey. over there!

197
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,038
What're you whispering about?

198
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,372
Oh, well...

199
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:54,873
Officer Takagi

201
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:55,207
Officer Takagi

202
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,775
Officer Takagi

203
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,844
I've got a little favor to:ask you...

204
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,446
What is it? .

205
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,664
What could! it be?

206
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,620
I'll go see: them:after all.

207
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,588
What?

208
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,991
If I go closer and take a look
I may be able to make out the culprit.

210
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,560
No! Didn:it IFjust tell youithat

211
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:19,931

B'But.

Not.only you.

215
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,407
There's a-danger of anyone who helped
you becoming.the-culprits target.

217
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,879
I know, how you feel about wanting

219
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,947

and keeping out of the picture
alsorequiresza lot-of courage too...

223
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:42,287
Yes . this is the right thing to do...

224
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:46,374
For yourself as well as for all the others...

225
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,826
That's the story...

228
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:48,894
Huh

229
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,230
Will you call the forensic officer
and get us a minus screw driver?

231
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,098
Yup.

232
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,433
I think everything will clear up...

233
00:08:55,434 --> 00:09:00,038
And we'll all find out Who /
the big fat liar street ripper,

235
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,375
that is resorting to cheap tricks
to hide his crime is...

237
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:03,642
that is resorting to cheap tricks
to hide his crime is...

239
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,711
Yes, it's him

240
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,413
Well, at any rate.

241
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:12,450
You're going to have to leave your cars
at the police station for a while.

243
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,553
There are a lot more things
we'd like to check on so...

245
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,888
Hey. hey. you've gotta be kidding

246
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,759
I came here to Beika Police Station;
voluntarily, you know.

248
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,162
Why are you taking things so far as
to keep my car in police custody?

250
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,699
P.Please give us
a convincing explanation too.

252
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,635
On why we were summoned here
as suspects of a street ripper case...

254
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:35,606
If you called us:in justibecause we don't
have an alibi during the time of the crime,

256
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:38,376
I'm sure there; are a lot of
her. people 00...

258
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,979
First of all, it's your car!

259
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,648
They are all of the same make and model.

260
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,449
Y.Yeah...

261
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,587
Moreover, all three of you say
you've lost your master key.

263
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,589
When the street ripper fled.

264
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,326
He dropped the car key of this car
with the emblem of the maker on it.

266
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,279
We already have reports that the culprit
picked the.key,up with hands

268
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,898
smeared with the blood of the victim.

269
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,667
We also know that he came back
to the site of the crime to confirm

271
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,236
whether the police had a lead on him.

272
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,906
We know too, from
the testimony of a witness

274
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,642
that the culprit is very likely a'resident
of this vicinity

276
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:16,214
who Knows he'll be in hot-water
once the police start checking on him.

278
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,251
That is, we know that the culprit:is
among you three

280
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,120
because you own this car model,
have no alibi,

282
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,788
Iive nearby and

283
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:29,628
cannot show-us your master key
because it is smeared with blood...

285
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,798
what?
'Told ou lreall ustlostm ke...

287
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,470
Well, a simpleicheck
by those forensic officers

289
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,538
will clear all of that in no time at all.

290
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,207
Ch.Check.)...?

291
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,141
What?

292
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,444
We're just going to check
for luminol reaction

294
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,147
Officer Takagi. please have them-begin

295
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:50,882
Y.Yeah

296
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,885
Please do as I told you to
over the phone then.

298
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,154
Yes, Sir.

299
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,391
First start from Mr. Enomoto"s car
n the far left...

301
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,158
Hey. hey,

302
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,295
PR dd
don't tell me that you're going to search
the inside of the car for the master key?

305
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,764
Even if you're the police,

306
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,499
you couldn't possibly do something
outrageous like that, can you...

308
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,166
Don't worry.

309
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,701
We won't check inside your car.

310
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,836
H-Hey, Conan?

311
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,838
What on earth are you-going to check?

312
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,174
If'I'were the culprit.

313
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,711
I would've thrown.the:blood stained key
away-long time ago!

315
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,847
Silly, we're not checking for the key.

316
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,784
We're checking the keyhole
of the.door of the driver:s seat side

318
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:30,955
that the culprit stuck the key in
when he fled.

320
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:34,826
I see! Blood should: be=there too. huh!

321
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,129
B.But, even if blood.were found there,
it would be a.very:small amount...

323
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,198
Will you really .berable:to make it out?

324
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,299
Of course.

325
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,767
Luminol reaction is

326
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,271
verysfssensitive and can detect
the slightest'amountiof blood...

328
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,172
Yeah,

329
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,340
the culprit went.out;all out
as to think.uprarcheaputrick

331
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,308
and lie in order;to/hide:the fact

334
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:55,313
Try: and remember

335
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:59,117
at the three. said..about wh
they were doing: at the time of the crime...

338
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,824
Mr. Enomoto was headed for
the mountains to take a drive...

340
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:11,463
Mr. Fukuchi drove around the shopping
arcade to check if his car was repaired...

342
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:16,000
And Mr. Degawa was going around
Iooking for the house of the person

344
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,470
who said she lost the house keys.

345
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,472
Why does that make them liars?

346
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,474
Then, take a look!

347
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:26,010
The car of Mr. Degawa. who says his car
is his heart and soul-is sparkling clean.

349
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:29,564
Mr. Fukuchi whoa.says-he's a lousy 'driver
has his car parked really near the next-car.

351
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:34,252
And the speed racer Mr. Enomoto-s.car-is
full ofiscratches and soiled.

353
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,287
Youtunderstand. now<;don't you?

355
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,290

363
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:51,836
Ohlil'see!

364
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,904
Mr. Fukuchi is lying!!

365
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:55,707
If he's not good at driving

366
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,575
he wouldn't even try driving through
a shopping arcade

368
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,444
where there are a lot of people!

369
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,398
Besides at the time of the crime it was
raining:and vision was poorer than usual.

371
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,052
It's the worse course to try out a car that
yousrexnotzeven sure is working right...

373
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:12,190
Moreover, Mr. Fukuchi parked his.car
completely parallel to the car next to, his.

375
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,993
That's only proof that
he's an extremely good driver!

377
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:18,763
If he's not good.»
he's car would be a biticrooked...

379
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:23,101
Then, the culprit is
Mr. Fukuchi and he's the:liar?

382
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:23,701
1 Co,

383
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,436
he parked his car very close to
the next car

385
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,906
to make checking the keyhole
of the door difficult.

387
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,207
But-it-s all over now...

388
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,478
Becauseslook,
the car next to his was moved.

390
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,648
So the keyhole on the driver's seat side
IS In clear view.

392
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,683
I'm sure there'll be:a-response:if:luminol
Is sprayed. onto the:keyhole

394
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:42,420
A bluish purple colorshould: be emitted

395
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,023
when it chemically reacts to blood...

396
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,561
Huh...no reaction

397
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:50,228
Hume!

398
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,162
Huh?

399
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,529
Otfikliflbrwr 1

401
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,880
R.Really...?

402
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:12,750
Hey,
just what's going on, Officer Takag!?

404
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:16,788
You said confidently that we would be
able to figure out who the culprit was...

406
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,358
Oh, well...
it was supposed to work out that way...

408
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,878
Huh

409
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,848
Excuse me, could you lend me
minus screw driver...?

411
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,484
Huh? A minus screw driver?

412
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,352
Here you go.

413
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,388
Thank you.

414
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,091
So. are you satisfied-jnow?

415
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:57,762
Since all three cars showed no reaction,
can we go now?

417
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,765
Now you know that
we're not the street ripper. right!!

419
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,967
Please calm down...

420
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,573
What's going on. Conan...?

421
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,475
It's not like you said at all...Huh?

422
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:10,708
It's not like you said at all...Huh?

423
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,844
Huh? Where's Conan?

424
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,380
He went that way just now,

425
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,666
after taking a minus screwdriver
from the forensic officer...

427
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,851
What?!

430
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:30,328
this: keyhole;moves like a slime
when: pushed 'from, outside?

432
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:30,795
Huh

434
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,199
I"'wonder-what it is?

435
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Oh. hey!!

436
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:36,467
Oh. hey!

438
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,045
H.Hey: sonny!!

439
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,921
The key cylinder is fixed in place
with vinyl tape!!

441
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,257
I see.

442
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,060
He changed it on the spur of the moment
with the cylinder of another car,

444
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:05,596
thinking that the police would check it out.

445
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:06,597
Which means

446
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,267
that the real reason why he parked
his car really close to the next car is...

448
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,069
to hide this.

449
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,222
Unless you open the door this way and
remove the cover,

451
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,076
you can't.cheCk how the key cylinder is
on the inside...

453
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,545
Then, then, don't tell me that...

454
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:24,949
Conan had foreseen
Il this to begin with...

456
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:31,222
Oh. well... This key Cylinder
1s really the one for this car!!

458
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,492
1.1 goofed when trying to set
it up and broke it...

460
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,129
It's just a temporary measure until a
replacement arrives...

462
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,766
Will you show us the key
to this car, then?!

464
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,402
As well as the car number
that is carved into it!

466
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,638
You should know since
you're an auto mechanic...

468
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,676
that there are numbers on the key cylinder
of the driver's seat side of the car.

470
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,513
If we compare the two, we can tell
whether it's the same key...

472
00:16:55,514 --> 00:17:00,601
Or would you like us to spray luminol
on to the key cylinder

474
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,071
of the ignition beside the steering wheel?

475
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:05,790
I'm sure blood reaction will be displayed.

476
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,910
Because the key cylinder
f the ignition is sealed

478
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:11,829
and cannot be changed in a
hort period of time...

481
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:18,469
O.0Okay! "if show you the key number!

482
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,280
I'm sure the key is
In the dashboard compartment...

484
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,652
Oh. hey!!

485
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,820
Hey. open up!!

486
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,045
This guy confessed later that

487
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,082
he did what he did because
he wanted public attention...

489
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,668
It seems he was just seeking stimulation
in his mundane life.

491
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:11,005
Although we cannot really say"that

492
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:17,295
it was fortunate
that no one died in thus:incident...

494
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,848
It turned out-that this stupid
attention seeker just jostled the area

496
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:26,037
around the Beika'iPolice Station a bit...
and the case was closed...

498
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:33,243
I'm sure glad that
the culprit-was caught though!

500
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:36,647
We don't have to. worry about Ayumi
being pursuedfby the culprit anymore!

502
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,317
I-doni-t mind-being pursued!

503
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:39,851
Huh

504
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:40,718
Why ?

505
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,989
Because I know Conan will protect me.

506
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,591
Hey. hey...

508
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:54,265
Of course I was counting on Mitsuhiko,
Genta and Al too!

510
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,733
I know I'd be totally fine!

511
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,370
O. Oh

512
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,377
Excuse me.

513
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,111
Huh

514
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,781
I have something I have to do.

515
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,784

562
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,357
My. how nice of you...

563
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,759
to come visit me...

564
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,560
Heave. heave...

565
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:06,130
If If I let time pass by.

566
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,899
I felt.like I was going to change
my mind, that's why...

568
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,835
0. you've made up your mind...

569
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:14,972
as to whether to accept the witness
protection program or not...

571
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:18,242
Yes...
of course,

573
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,833
Of course...

574
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:26,284
I'm declining.

575
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,622
It's probably true that

576
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,660
I'd be safe if I change my name and address
and-become an entirely different person...

578
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,863
But. I'd have to go over the
same thing again anyway...

580
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,464
I'll be living a vicious circle
of fear and hiding.

582
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:42,733
Then becoming another person

583
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,336
when the danger of my identity being
revealed comes around...!

585
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,671
Besides. there is no guarantee

586
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:51,676
that I can completely trust
you FF. B I. agents...

588
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,212
And...besides...

589
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,834
although I understand how itsfeels to
want to punish the bad guys...

591
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:02,820
and keeping out of the picture
also requires a lot of courage too...

593
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,221
B:But...

594
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,289
But...

595
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:05,756
But)...

596
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,156
But)...

597
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,159
don't want to run!

598
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,829
I can't win just running around!

599
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,165
I can never win!!

600
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,969
I. don't want to run...

601
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:25,176
@nh.
SO, you've decided against it after all...

603
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,645
You're not going to
try to convince me otherwise...

605
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,012
Well...

606
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:32,983
I'm against your idea
as an F B.l. agent but...

608
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:39,906
since I experienced somebody coming
after my life when I was still a child...

610
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:45,029
I'd like, you to cherish how
you feel right now!...

612
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,432
Hang in there

613
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,305
See you...

614
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,286
Ghads...

615
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:12,390
It's like I'm watching you as a child...

616
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:12,723
It's. like I'm watching you as a child...

617
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,193
You, who kept denying to accept the
witness protection program...

619
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,796
And in the end, shouted defiantly
to let you join the F.B.I.

621
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,165
in exchange for accepting the program...

622
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,034
Wrong. James,

623
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:29,339
she seems to already have
what I lacked back then...

626
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,341
[RIC Ye?

627
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:38,482
Yes..-something that is very dangerous
and capable of breeding disaster...

629
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:42,219
But yet a very warm thing
that gives you courage...

631
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:03,007
There's something that feels familiar
about this place!

634
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:06,610
Nostalgia. as they say...

636
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,382
Beware of fire

637
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,684
Huh? Where's Ayumi?

638
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,687
WwW. Wait, don't leave me behind!
Here ( oes...

640
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:17,822
Whaaaa!

641
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,127
Don't tell me that...

642
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:23,360
(BI¥R)
Don"t-tell me that...

644
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:28,432
