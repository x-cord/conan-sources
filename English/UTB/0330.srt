Dark stains are rinsed
clean and exposed

00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,440
The sad reality over friendship

7
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,509
You can't buy happiness with money.

8
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,378
He sees through the one and only truth,

00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:14,179
A child in appearance
with the l1.Q. of an adult

Orv Ty

22
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,901
We, the Youth Detective Squad
come along to camp with Dr. Agasa

24
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,121
We happen to run into 4 university
students of an Qutdoor:Club

26
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,057
riding a luxurious camping car,
whose names are

28
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,925
Reiji Fukuura,

29
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,194
Yasumi Shirato.

30
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:11,797
Haruka Tendo

31
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,466
and Takuhito Meshiau...

33
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,271
But, while we were all having barbecue,
and chatting away

35
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,273
Yasumi disappears.

36
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,810
So we left to look for her and headed for
the scenic point

38
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,412
to watch the fireworks while we were at it,
but she wasn't there either...

40
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,549
On the way back to the camping grounds,

41
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,220
we find Yasumi lying dead
in the middle of a winding road!

43
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,727
Which means that the killer is someone
who could freely take the bicycle

45
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,263
rom the camping car...

46
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,298
Yeah...

47
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,301
Her friends who belong
to the same circle

49
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:52,704
The probability of the killer
being among the three is high!!

Friendship Torn Apart Part 2

00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:03,682
(13214)

54
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,185
W. Wait a minute. officer!

55
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,588
Why do we have to be
questioned for alibi?

57
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,257
Yasumi died of an accident, didn't she?!

58
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,592
Well, it's just to be.sure!

60
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:20,666
So. please tell us where you all were
around 5:00 to 6:00 when Yasumi died.

62
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,737
Well, we were:all doing/different things.
Moving around here and there...

64
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,674
I was fishing alone...

65
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,011
I was keeping watch over time
and camping!

67
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,748
Then, who drives the camping car?

68
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,419
Reiji used to be in a car gang before
SO he's good at driving...

70
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,756
Hey. hay. if it's just moving the car:
all three of can do it!

72
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:48,260
Takuhito, sometimes takes
over driving for me,

74
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,663
and Haruka's the one who brings this car
to our meeting place!

77
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,067
Uh, why are you asking us
something like this?

79
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:55,300
Hah)

80
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,135
Oh, well, I figured if
you can't drive the car

82
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,138
it would be impossible
to move the corpse to wheresit was...

84
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,275
So, you're suspecting us after all?!

85
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,543
Yeah, right!

86
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,210
Huh?!

87
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:05,944
What the?!

88
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:11,149
If you leave Yasumi's body
in the middle of the street beforehand,

90
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,386
and pretend not to see her on the way
uphill, then act as if you saw her

92
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:18,689
for the first time
on your way back, it's not impossible

94
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,828
Moreover, there aren't many cars
going through here,

96
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,530
and if the driver is the killer with nobody
riding in the passenger's seat

98
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,400
when going uphill...

99
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,802
it's true that nobody was sting
in the passenger's seat

101
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,606
when I was driving but...

102
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,743
If I drove in the oncoming lane,
the view outside the window would

104
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,879
change and somebody sitting in
the back seat would've noticed.

106
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,816
And besides I could never do such a feat
as to avoid somebody lying

108
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,820
in the middle of the road
without changing lanes

110
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,240
Besides, when we passed here
the sunroof was open,

112
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,160
and we were sticking our heads out of it,

113
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,362
but there was nothing on the road...

114
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:59,831
You stuck your heads out of the sunroof?

115
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:02,334
YÃ©s, When we did so last year
we saw fireworks

117
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,636
from between the mountains...

118
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,439
So. we wanted to show those children
the same thing too:

120
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,975
Well, but you can only catch a view of it
for about 10 seconds

122
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,377
until turning the curve...

123
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:18,583
ut...if you open the sunroof afte
you successfully avoid the corpse then...

125
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,252
So, like I've been saying,
its Impossible to go by

127
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:20,986
without running over the corpse!

128
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:24,489
Right. the car didn't w Be

129
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,592
before or after the sunroof was epened...

130
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,394
0000

131
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,330
What the?

132
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,333
There are-strange looking lines...
on the edge of the sunroof...

134
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,268
It It can't be?!

135
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,539
Conan?!

136
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,408
Hey, Conan!

137
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,352
What're these lines!

138
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,024
This is blood...

139
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,826
Blood dried in streaks...

140
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,297
I $&O...
So, that's the story...

142
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,099
I've figured this case out!

143
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,569
And the only one
who could've worked out this trick is

145
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,571
the one who seems to be
highly skilled in...

147
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:16,842
Huh?

148
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:18,826
Oh, my flashlight!

149
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,045
There!

150
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,647
On thank you...Genta!

151
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,316
Are you all right?

152
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,319
Thank you A, A, A, Al...

153
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,153
Please be careful!

154
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:32,057
It's sort of windy today, and

155
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,393
the car .is-slanted
because it's a slope here...

157
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,862
It's not too bad up here on the car, is it...

158
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,967
Because the night view is so nice...

159
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:47,372
Agh. this is the place where
we watched the fireworks from the car!

161
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,574
Over here?

162
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:53,445
Wait a sec... Then, the trick
that I was thinking of a while ago...

164
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,112
Hey, everyone!

165
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,249
It's dangerous Climbing up
a place like that...

167
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,050
Huh /!

168
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,387
C.Conan?!

169
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,990
Hey, Conan!
Where do you think you're going?!

171
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:09,194
Close call...
I was about to fall for the killer's trap...

173
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,446
The real trick is...

174
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,005
I found it! This is it!

175
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,941
D.Did you find somethin?

176
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,545
Yep, a vinyl sheet.
It seems to have blood on it!

178
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:27,879
WwW. What?!

179
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:33,218
True, We'd better report this right away
to Inspector Megure...

181
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,253
I sure am in a fix...

182
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,023
Anybody can use this trick

183
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,392
and there is no evidence
to specify the killer...

185
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,195
I'll just have to...

186
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,263
show the sheet and
watch how he responds...

188
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,601
What?! A blood smeared vinyl sheet?!

189
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,137
Yes! It was stuck on a guard rail

190
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,806
about 50 meters downhill!

191
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,210
I see...It sure is blood...

192
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:04,149
H.Hey, isn't that the sheet that
we always use when we go camping?

194
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,886
What? Will you come
here and confirm it?

196
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:08,620
Yeah...

197
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,690
Just as I thought!

198
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:15,794
h,...But, we haven't been us
recen y ecauseil as a oe in.

201
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,597
But, why would it be in a place like this...

202
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,332
No good...

203
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,934
None of them. are reacting at all...

204
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:27,138
I've got to search the mountains
and look for some other evidence...

206
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:27,906
Huh...?

207
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:34,613
I see...l get it...
Blood splattered on the Killer...

209
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,717
I can understand that
it was done on the spur of the moment...

211
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,836
But, now the killer has no way out...

212
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,056
The killer's made a grave mistake...!!

213
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,129
So, like I've been telling you?!

214
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:55,267
At around 7.00 p mm. when we passed
here with the camping car

216
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,403
to look for Yasumi
there was nothing on the road.

218
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,906
And 2 hours later, when we came back

219
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:04,442
we found Yasumi
Iying in the middle of the road!

221
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,913
The only thing that was on the road
was the wooden fence

223
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,515
that fell from right above this road!

224
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,718
And didn't you say
so yourse .0 lcer...

226
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:17,255
that the place where the fence was
broken and the place where the broken

228
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,858
piece was and the place where
Yasumi's body was,

230
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,826
were all in one straight line.

231
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:26,031
The traces of the wheels were found
near the broken fence,

233
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,567
and the bicycle was stuck in the bushes
outside the guard rail of the road

235
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,236
where the piece of broken fence was,
SO...

237
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:36,441
Yasumi probably accidentally crashed
through the fence

239
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,443
and fell to her death...

240
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,946
You also explained that
we didn't see Yasumi

242
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,548
when we first passed here
because she was probably stuck

244
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:49,888
in the bushes with her bicycle and
slid then down to the road

246
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,757
just before we passed here
on our way back, didn't you?

248
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,226
Y.Yes, that's right.

249
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,829
Then, it was an accident after all!

250
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,765
Why do we have to be suspected?!

251
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,367
There are no blood stains...

252
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,504
on the road that
Yasumi was thought to have fallen to...

254
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,909
If she crashed through the fence and fell,
isn't it strange

256
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,579
that there's not even a drop of blood
on the road where she fell?

258
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,882
N,No...Are you saying that vy
Yasumi was...

260
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,151
And this vinyl sheet!

261
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,955
If these blood stains are Yasumi's ,

262
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,625
it has something to do with the killing...

263
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,226
It sure is connected to the killing!

264
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:28,627
Huh?!

265
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,312
D Dr. Agasa?!

266
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:31,162
What the?!

267
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:32,029
Huh 7!

268
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,130
What?!

269
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:33,932
Doc...7?7!

270
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,603
With the window closed,
it's hard to hear my deduction, isn't it?!.

272
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,606
Will you please open
the sunroof for,me?!

274
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:42,807
Oh, yes...!

276
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,681
Why are you up on the car like that?

277
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,618
I just wanted to get a taste of
what it feels like!

279
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,955
To be loaded on the roof of a camping
car after being killed. Yasumi was!!

281
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,165
What it feels like to be loaded
on a camping car after being killed...?

283
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,769
W.Which means that the killer loaded

284
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,904
Yasumi's body on the roof of
this car after all...?!

286
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:19,444
Yes! The killer. under the pretense of
going to.look for Yasumi got into the car

288
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:24,249
together with us and dropped Yasumi's
body romdhe top of the roof on the way!

290
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,252
The way Yasumi was killed,
probably went like this...

292
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,789
The killer probably asked Yasumi
to climb up

294
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,525
and wipe the dirty
sunroof or something...

296
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,895
And Yasumi probably agreed,

297
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,130
which after the killer snuck up behind her
and hit her on the

299
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,801
head with a stone or something!

300
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,904
As proof of that, there is a streak
of reddish black line

302
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:49,040
on the glass of the sunroof!

303
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,976
A streak of blood that remained in
the corner when the killer wiped off

305
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,247
blood that splattered on when he hit her!

306
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,249
But, gramps,

307
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,654
How was Yasumi's body dropped in
a just right place like that!

309
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,590
We were all in the car, you know.

310
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:06,758
Reijr...

311
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:12,163
When you. .:.tried to avoid the fence
that came falling on the road right above,

313
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,766
you slammed on the brakes
and drifted slightly, didn't you?

315
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,101
YyYeah....so what?

316
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,172
Ee. . You took advantage
the impact of drifting

318
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:27,112
and made the body go over the guard rail
throwing it onto the road below...

320
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,581
You left the debris of
the fence on"the road

322
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,416
as a marker as to where to drift the car...

323
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:36,087
That way, you would be able to
find the body on the way back...

325
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:40,558
H.Hold it, but there are many
sharp curves before going by there!

327
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,628
If the dead body's not fastened
to something

329
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,096
it would fall way before that point!

330
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,366
Were there masking tape or ropes
on Yasumi's body?!

332
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:53,303
Oh...come to think.of it, her belt...

333
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,009
IS the same one that
Yoko Okino was wearing the other day...!

335
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:02,147
Something was on her belt!

336
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,015
But. how could that have been used...

337
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,683
Oh, didn't you notice...

338
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:06,551
Huh?

339
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:12,157
The decoration on the tip of her belt,
only one edge was tied...

342
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:17,629
Yeah, I saw that (00.
I thought it was a fashion of some kind...

344
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,565
Oh, right!"Officer Takagi!

345
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,902
Williyou please close
the sunroof for now?

347
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,370
Oh. all right...

348
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,974
See! 1 here's. the blood streak
I mentioned a while ago!

350
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,110
T's a little away from the edge. isn't?

351
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,444
Why do you think it's that way?

352
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,649
Es it's probably because
the sunroof was a little open

354
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,450
when the person killed Kazumi!

355
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,987
Why was the sunroof a little open?

356
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:44,722
What do you mean why...

357
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,257
I.l see!

358
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,594
If one edge of the belt was tied. then...

359
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,062
Exactly!

360
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,399
The killer pinched the tied part
to the sunroof

362
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,869
and fixed Yasumi's body in
place on top of the car!

364
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,038
After bending her body in half!!

365
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,842
The killer left the sunroof a little open

366
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,111
so that he could carry out
the murder smoothly.

368
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,848
He left it open because
unless he did so,

370
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,851
after he hit Yasumi to death
on top of the car,

372
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,221
he would've had to go down,
open the sunroof,

374
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,557
then climb up again to stick the string
between the sunroof

376
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,961
and finally come down again
to close the sunroof

378
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:27,031
Since there is only one button
to open the sunroof by the driver's seat.

380
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,969
You did say a while ago that
when you first passed by here,

382
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,640
you opened the sunroof and watched
the fireworks. but who opened it...?

384
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,109
O. Of course, I did
since I was driving the car...

386
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,645
HaruKa asked me to open it so...

387
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,580
W Well...

388
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:46,784
I just wanted to do what was good
Iast year, this year too

390
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,021
I see, If so, it's net difficult
to assume that

392
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,157
someone will ask
to open the sunroof this year too.

394
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,027
Even if it is not so,
since you're at the driver's seat ,

396
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,696
you could secretly open it
without anybody noticing it

398
00:14:59,198 --> 00:14:59,964
H.Hey...

399
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,967
You opened the sunroof

400
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,703
and removed the tied part
that was stuck to the window

402
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:08,773
and let the corpse go free
then you drifted the car on the road

404
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,375
where the piece of broken fence was,

405
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,176
and swing her body down
on the road below

407
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,813
In other words,
the one who can work out this trick is

409
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,549
one with skilled driving techniques
Iike you

411
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,752
who used to belong to a car gang!

412
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,153
You'd think so, right?

413
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:22,954
Huh?

414
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:23,888
Huh 2!

415
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,891
The fact is not so!

416
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,627
Actually, I thought so at first too...

417
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,763
But. I had forgotten that...

418
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,899
this car had been going uphill

419
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,536
and that this was just the place
where the sunroof was opened!

421
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:43,474
But, after seeing the blood smeared
vinyl sheet it dawned on me!

423
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:47,278
If the vinyl sheet is laid
under the body of the corpse

425
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,548
and friction is decreased, it's easy.

426
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,151
The minute the the sunroof is opened

427
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:55,153
because of the impact
of the wind and the slope

429
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,488
the dead body would slide off
the top of the car!

431
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:04,595
Which means that any of you Â¢
three could've committed the murder.

433
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,798
I'm very sorry to say this.

434
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,800
But I would like\ ou all
to come to the station with me.

436
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,935
You don't have to do that!

437
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:11,602
What?

438
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:15,206
Because the killer has made a mistake
wearing-clothes!

440
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,341
Wearingsclothes?

441
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,811
Will you three stand up
and go out to the corridor?

443
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,347
Shoots...l tell you...

444
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,350
So what the hell can you find out
doing something like this...?

446
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,051
Aght!

447
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,520
What's the matter, Ayumi...?

448
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,789
See, her belt...

450
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,526
Her belt is net through the belt
Ioop of her jeans!

452
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:36,160
Huh?

454
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:36,394
Huh?

455
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,463
Then, don't tell me that...

456
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,198
You're the killer?

457
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,668
(No! I was in a rush
when coming from home...

459
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:48,139
Ayumi, you took a picture of
everyone, didn't you?

461
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,007
Oh. uh huh...

462
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,711
I think you took a rear view shot
of her 100. if I remember correctly...

464
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:54,645
Wait...

465
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,316
Here it is!

466
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,550
This is the one!!!

467
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,721
But her belt is through the belt loop
Iike it should be!

469
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:07,525
It was through the belt looprat first and
why isn't it now?

471
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,560
On, well I took a shower
In this camping car at sundown

473
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:12,997
0 I may have done: then...

474
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:18,136
Uh, isuikhecessary to remove your belt
when you take off your jeans?

476
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:21,739
Oh, it's because I changed into
a different pair of jeans...

478
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,475
Oh...you changed jeans...

479
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:25,143
Y,Y@Ss...

480
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,012
Could I have a look at it?

481
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,479
Yes...

482
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,983
mm...it sure looks like the on
you reswearing

484
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,620
although you say you changed jeans...

485
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,122
The one in this picture...

486
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,924
W. Well, I guess so...

487
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,327
Then, I don't mean to be rude, \

488
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,064
but please show me the jeans
before you changed...

490
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,331
WwW. Well...

491
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,600
You can't show it to him
even if you wanted to, right? \

494
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:54,505
It's probably the jeans that
you were wearing when you hit Yasumi,

496
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,607
and you threw it away in the mountains,

497
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,377
somewhere with the clothes
you were wearing back then, right...?

499
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,847
Because they were splattered
with Yasumi's blood!!

501
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:09,587
But, she let us ride this car
when we went to go watch the fireworks!

503
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,389
R.Right!

504
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,926
Why would she want us to ride the car
that she had the dead body on?

506
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,063
Rather..she had to make us ride the-car!

507
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:22,100
If I followed this camping car
with my car from behind

509
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,703
I would see the dead body
sliding off the camping car...

512
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,172
But, but .

514
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,309
ou're so rich...

515
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,045
I'm not rich...

516
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,179
ob 00

517
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:39,183
I'm an ordinary university student
with no special talent...

519
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:44,522
That's: why:unless I acted rich
nobody would even look at me...

521
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,824
I really had a tough time...

522
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,961
I worked part-time with all my might,
and even borrowed money

524
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,014
to rent this expensive camping car
in order to take everybody

526
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,832
to the beach and the mountains...

527
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,769
U., SOMe Ow Pu eC rough) recause
they were the first friends I had...

529
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,640
Yes...l thought they were my friends...

530
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:07,310
Until I heard what Yasumi said...!!

531
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:11,315
Huh, didn't you know?!

532
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,752
It's all just a bunch of baloney that
she's from a rich family!

534
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:19,207
I could tell right off the bat
that she wasn't

536
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,576
So I followed her, and sure enough,
she was living in a rundown apartment!

538
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,762
Which means I was being deceived
for four years?!

540
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:28,966
Then why don't you tell her to stop lying?

541
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:32,036
You're her best friend, aren't you?
Yasumi...

543
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,437
Best friend?

544
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,706
All she means to me is money

545
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,475
Do you think I could continue faking
that I didn't know

547
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,343
about this for four years otherwise!

548
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,280
It was really tough for me
to keep from laughing though...

550
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,682
Besides. if I told her and
she gets angry at me

552
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,553
demanding to get back all she dished out
up to now, what would I do?

554
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,555
I don't think she's that kind of girl...

555
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,890
Too bad, Reiji...

556
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,826
I guess you were sort of
Iooking forward to getting rich, right?

558
00:19:55,827 --> 00:20:00,731
Yeah, too bad...l guess I'll
bid her farewell as soon as we graduate

560
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,467
Well, I guess I'll have her devote
herself and money to me till then

562
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,603
Dear Ms. Richie-Rich, Haruka!

563
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,412
I believed, I believed that
you they were my best friends

565
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:18,883
T.That's why you killed:Yasumi and
tried to frame Reiji up as. the killer

567
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,086
Yes! I got angry at her
just as she thought I would!

569
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,655
At that woman who had the nerve
to step alllover my feelings of friendship!

571
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,058
That's\not 'being friends at all!

572
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:33,264
That's not being friends
at all to begin withl!!

574
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:37,468
Yes, she's right it's no better than the
vending machine of juice cans +/

577
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,738
In other words, if you put money into the
machine it-will quench your thirst.

579
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,156
But if you don't insert money, it
won't give you anything

581
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:48,112
You can't buy
people's hear-ts with money

Al's final remark was splendid!

628
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:39,056
Yes. it made me feel good!

629
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:42,026
You sure can make good remarks
when you want to. can;t you, Ail

631
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:46,630
Not really it's some phrase I heard
somebody elsÃ© say... Â»

633
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:52,303
thought:that's how it would nermally be...

634
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:57,808
Sometime in the past, Ran refused
Sonoko's invitation to go skiing with her

636
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,210
When I asked her why,
she told me a bit depressed,

638
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,213
that she didn't have enough
allowance that month...

640
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,817
I told her to have rich
Sonoko pay her way too.

642
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,687
Then she angrily looked
at me and said

644
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,423
she would never do such a thing because

645
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,693
she wants to stay
friends with Sonoko forever.

647
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:22,716
That's why I felt that their relationship
with Haruka seemed kind of fake

649
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:26,871
They seemed to be flattering
her only because she was rich.

651
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,809
But, you were really cool!

654
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,613
You. can call me by
my first:name, it's okay.

656
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,482
You want to call me
by my first name. don't you?

658
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,020
Really, Ail

659
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,892
T.Then can...

660
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,076
Wercalll you:by your first. name too!

662
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,962
NO yourtwo:can t

663
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:03,607
want to see Senoko s
villain Karuizawa too!

665
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,611
And besides, if I know
Sonoke: for what'she is,

668
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,882
she'll probably think.up.Some no
good idea like always anyway

670
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,286
He's not in bed...
