00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,686
With a strong mind
and sharp powers of reasoning,

3
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,288
a keen sense of rhythm that grape
the meaning of the crime,

5
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,056
today's episode is a unique type
of mystery story.

7
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,325
Flourishing business is the entrance
to a criminal case.

9
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,894
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,662
A child in a earance
with the IQ. of an adult,

12
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,931
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

tin kin bcfl b': C5

18
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,960
A suspicious man?

19
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:08,828
Yeah.

20
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:13,032
Your family has a diner's business, right?

21
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,835
I know! Manpuku Diner's

22
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,438
The shop is dark, dirty

23
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,908
and because everything tastes lousy,
it's always empty!

25
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:25,211
Oh...I'm sorry.

26
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,613
And: in what way is that man suspicious?

27
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,817
He suddenly came around
2 months ago...

29
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,954
My name is Yuji Kamekura.

30
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:35,855
Yuji Kamekura (28)

31
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,491
I owe the shop owner
who passed away my gratitude...
Yuji Kamekura (28)

34
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,027
To my deceased husband?

35
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,895
What kind of gratitude?

36
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,898
It's something so great
that I could never express it in words.

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,234
So, in order to pay the master back,

39
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,970
I'm wondering if you'd let me stay here

40
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,339
and work for you
as a token of my gratitude, yes.

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,642
You mean you want us
to let you live here?!

44
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,945
W,We can't afford hiring anyone!

45
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,481
I'm not asking to be paid!

46
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,750
I just want to pay him back
for what he did for me!!

48
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,486
Please let me!

49
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,488
Okay, I've got to get to work.

50
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,894
So saying,
he forced his way into our house...

53
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,298
But, something is definitely strange!

54
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,635
Because grandpa who passed away,
was stingy and had a bad personality.

56
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,838
He would never do a favor for anybody!

57
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,841
I'm sure that man is up to something.

58
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,476
That's why

59
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,379
I want the Youth Detective Squad
to find out what it is!

61
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:34,980
Shoots!

62
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,249
L'thought it was going to be
an interesting case,

64
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:41,220
but it's nothing but a liar trying to freeload.

65
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:44,423
I smell something super fishy
that may lead to a crime!

67
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,425
Same here!

68
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,293
Idotoo!

69
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:50,763
Yes, it smells, really smells super fishy.

70
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,898
Ai'?!I

71
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,233
All right!

72
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,569
It's show time
for the Youth Detective Squad!

75
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,772
Give it all'iyouEv'Ã©'lgot;f'.Conan,

77
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,775
Because I unfortunately have
other commitments.

79
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:03,843
Bye-bye!

80
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,779
Hey, don't walk away like that, no fair, Al!!

81
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,248
What?!

82
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,420
You mean, this is Manpuku Diners?!

83
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,488
So, what?

84
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,823
The shop's) so pretty now}.

85
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,360
Look at all those customers

86
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,698
It's because of that man...

87
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,440
We got'no customers at all again today...

88
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,177
s-usual, Aha, ha...

89
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,780
After all, there are loads of delicious
and nice diners so...

91
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,452
We can't go on like this...

92
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:50,356
Okay!

93
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,892
I have experience as a cook

94
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,161
so I'll give you special training in cooking!

95
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,930
And, let's renovate the shop
to make it brighter and more Cheerful

97
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,965
Renovate the shop. . .'?

98
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,902
I'll dish out all the cash

99
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:03,969
Please don't be hesitant

100
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,105
because all I want to
do is repay the favor!

102
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:13,712
D...the shop started doin
unbelievably good...

104
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,848
What's so suspicious about all that?

105
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,050
He dished out his own money
to renovate the shop

107
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,785
as a token of his gratitude, right?

108
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,021
He's a nice man.

109
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,289
I got it!!

110
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:27,960
He's going to make good business
and split after taking all the money!

112
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,362
Is that what the man's thinking?!

113
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,698
If he wants to split with the cash,

114
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,067
why should he help the shop
make-money, then steal it?

116
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,370
Wouldn't it be faster for him
,to pick eat-flourishing shop to begin with?

118
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,439
Oh, yeah...

119
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,175
Smell of a crime, my foot...

120
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:44,710
Hmm'?

121
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,111
Just what does that mean?

122
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:47,179
What?

123
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:52,051
Researching newnmenu.
Absolutely off-'limits, Kamekura

125
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,257
The man's in the room from morning
to night thinking up new menus...

127
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,460
He won't even let us in,

128
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,129
saying that it is a secret
til he completes the menu.

130
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,130
Rintaro!

131
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,935
We're busy, so if you're home,
you've got to help!

133
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,271
Come on, say bye-bye to your friends!

134
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,040
I see,

135
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,008
1 I  fr

136
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,643
If the sho ets bus

137
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,313
the members of the family will have to
stay at the shop all day...

139
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,782
In the meantime,

140
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:27,920
the one who proposed'all this
stays secretly confined to his room...

142
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,857
This sure sounds like the pattern of
TheuRedeeaded  League. . .'?!

144
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,260
It can't be...

145
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,728
I've got it!

146
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,198
I'm sure that this is the pattern
of the Red-Headed League'!

148
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,268
Oh, The Red-Headed League!

149
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,203
What's that?

150
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,805
The Red-Headed League" is

151
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:51,477
one of the most famous among
the 600 stories of Sherlock Holmes.

153
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:55,414
A man who sneaks into a shop
as an employee,

155
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,883
gets the shop owner to step out
of the shop by telling a Clever lie.

157
00:06:58,385 --> 00:06:59,285
In the meantime,

158
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:04,423
he digs a tunnel underground
towards the bank in an attempt to rob it.

160
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,961
It is a masterpiece that describes
a very bold and bizarre crime!

162
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,164
Thanks for the explanation.

163
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,435
Butilid like to add that it was written
more than a hundred years ago.

165
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,738
I wonder where in the world today
you>can find a criminal so patient

167
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,974
who'd dig a tun'nel
in order to steal Valuables...

169
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:23,709
Huh?

170
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,246
W,What are you:guys doing?

172
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,715
we should be able to hear something.

173
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,119
Stop acting silly.

174
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,121
I'll go check it out for you!

175
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,057
Check it out?

177
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,533
Is he the one...?

180
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,003
What is it, Rintaro?

182
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,606
We're sorry to bother you
when you're busy, but...

184
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,643
you must be the god of fortune

185
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,579
because the minute you came,
the shop is so busy.

187
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,316
I came wanting to see what the palm
of the god of fortune looks like...

189
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:05,851
The palm of my hand?

190
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,252
Oh! Sure.

191
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,121
Go ahead and take a look at it!

192
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,857
T,This is!

193
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,992
This can't be, hey...

194
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,066
Hey, it was,'wasn't it?
The hand of a criminal?!

196
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,002
That's not what I checked for.

197
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,405
He had a lot of blisters
and calluses on his hand.

199
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,075
It's the hand of one who uses a shovel!

200
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,910
It's hard to believe

201
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,313
but I'm sure he's digging a hole
under the house!

203
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,515
I told you so!

204
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,251
You're fantastic, Mitsuhiko!

205
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:44,390
Too bad Mitsuhiko got \the credit this time.

206
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:45,791
But...

207
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,926
can something like this
really be happening...?

209
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:48,927
The thing is,

210
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,463
where is the tunnel
that he's digging headed towards!

212
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,265
Conan?!

213
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,133
Conan?!

215
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,538
Locc...

216
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,275
The closest bank from Manpuku Diners
is here!

219
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:03,642
fan
flfimfltttif!
SlfiÃ©

222
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,677
mmnmttm
same
But, it's closed.

225
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,581
This bank's been closed down
since a week ago

227
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,550
So, it can't be here.

228
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:12,284
No...

229
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,087
Nufuh, wrong again!

230
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,156
You seem to have swung at air again,
Conan.

232
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,027
Another place near here
that could be a target would be...

234
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,565
Agh! There's a jewelry shop

235
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:33,505
It's impossible for any thief
to steÃ©l "anything from our shop.

237
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,443
Because this place is protected
by a fail-proof security system,

239
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,445
thanks to a bitter experience in the past!

240
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,314
A bitter experience in the past?

241
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:47,786
We've been robbed before
of 3 billion yen worth of jewelry

243
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,256
and the robber hasn't been arrested yet...!

244
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:52,791
A jewel thief...

246
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,327
And the thief hasn't been arrested yet?!

248
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:57,196
Maybe this could be...?!

249
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,400
When were you robbed?

250
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,836
Next month makes it exactly 5 years ago.

251
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,171
I guess not, then...

252
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,707
A jewel thief...

253
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,244
and a suspicious man who is
secretly digging a hole underground...

255
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,246
This could be

256
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:15,848
Mitsuhiko'?

257
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,115
Mitsuhiko'?

258
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:20,919
Hey. Mitsuhiko,
don't tell met that you're thinking that...

260
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:23,655
-4".

261
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,524
Mitsuhiko!

262
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,193
Well, I've got to go because I'm busy!

263
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,331
What were you asking her, Mitsuhiko'?

264
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,667
I've solved the mystery!

265
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,971
A man ca 9 I'. GU16 ura IS

266
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,173
the one who stole the jewelry

267
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,575
from that jewelry shop we just went to
5 years ago!

269
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,577
He's the jewel thief?!

270
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:46,712
Really?

271
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,114
I'm sure my deduction is correct

272
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,717
Aha, ha...l thought so.

273
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,053
But, that deduction's a bit too farfetched!

274
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,390
However, the thief is no dunce!

275
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,260
If he sells the loot immediately,
he'll be caught,

277
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,796
and it would also be too risky
to keep the loot with him right through.

279
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:06,865
Therefore,

280
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,936
he buried the loot somewhere
right after he stole it, for the time being!

282
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,438
He happened to bury the loot

283
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,440
right under Rintaro's house
that was being re-built back then!

285
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,911
The house was being re-built...?

286
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,648
Oh, so that's what you were asking
the lady a while ago!

288
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,516
Right!

289
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:28,854
So, Kamekura forced his way
into the house as a live-in employee,

291
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,124
in order to gradually dig out the loot.

292
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,293
Wow, Mitsuhiko, you're awesome!

293
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,662
What a perfect deduction!

294
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,598
I mean, it's not'that much of a big deal.

295
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,734
No need to be shy, renown detective! But,
I was thinking Ã©long the same line too.

297
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:46,238
Why would he want to dig it out now,
after leaving it buried for 5 years?

300
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,508
Fuh! Don't you get it, Conan?

301
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,911
He was waiting for the statute to expire.

302
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:54,980
The period of prescription expires
in 5 years.

304
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:00,919
Which means he can soon
hold his head up high and sell the loot off.

306
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,256
That only goes for criminal cases!

307
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,191
The period of expiration for civil affairs
is 20 years!

309
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,192
Which means

310
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,530
even if he digs it out now,
he won't be able to own the jewelry.

312
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:15,701
Ha,ha,ha...!
We don't know of such complicated rules.

314
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:20,038
If we don't know about it,
I'm sure the thief doen't either.

316
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,208
H,Hey...

317
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,545
You're just argumentative by nature,
aren't you Conan.

319
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,182
Mom always tells me
that it's important for people

321
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:33,151
to accept things without argument.

322
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,754
That's not the point...

323
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:40,158
Let's go tell the police
that he's actually a jewelry thief!

325
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,894
Don't! There's no evidence!

326
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,229
You'll just end up
embarrassing yourselves!

328
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,565
Shoots, okay.

329
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,301
All we've got to do is
catch him in the act, right!

331
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,103
jiJst what'do you intend to do?

332
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,838
I'm going to set up a trap!!

333
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,308
A trap...?! Hey...

336
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:07,285
(),

344
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,088
Oh, it's you...

345
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,490
You want to see my palm again?

346
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:15,360
We know about everything!

347
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,229
W,What'?!

348
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:21,033
You can't deceive the eyes of
we the Youth Detective Squad!

350
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:22,567
Good-bye!

351
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,370
Good - bye!

353
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:25,704
'BU""

364
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:28,240
Qt? x

368
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,508
G,Good-bye.

369
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,881
So, now all we do is
wait for him to fall for it.

371
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,751
What kind of trap
is that supposed to be

373
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:43,088
He'll anic etflustered
And commit himself right away, for sure!

376
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,156
Sure!

377
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,824
It's perfect!

378
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,293
Where in the world
woula there be an adfllt

380
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,996
whd'd panic just 'cuz
some grade schooler takes a jab at him

382
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,498
The following morning

383
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,033
What?!

384
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,636
YoUr'fwfiole familylis going{
on a 1 night 2 days hot spring trlp?

386
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,204
Yeah,

387
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,307
Mr. Kamekura suddenly recommended
father and the others to take a trlp!

389
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,977
He said that we should go on 3 mp
and relax

391
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:10,182
since we haven't had a day of rest
after the shop started getting busy.

393
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,385
And of course
Mr. Kamekura's not going, right?

395
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,453
Right,

396
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,988
he says just our family should go
and enjoy ourselves.

398
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,991
He's making the entire family
Ieave the house

400
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,527
and then is planning
to dig it out all at once!

402
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,629
I'm sure that's it!

403
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,331
Like I told you, Conan,

404
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,301
he fell right for the trap
and started making his move!

406
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:30,836
It can't be...

407
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,371
Can this really be happening?!

408
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,780
I don't have the slightest idea
what's going on

410
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,317
You seem to be completely lost.

411
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,885
Well,

412
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,988
where in the world are there criminals
that will make moves

414
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,324
Just because they're pushed from behind
by a bunch of grade school kids!

416
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,459
And, there are other things
that I donlt get either,

418
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,193
Iike...

419
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:56,461
Conan,

421
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,731
Maybe the man you're dealing with is

422
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,869
very different from the criminals
that you've handled so far.

424
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,204
In what way?

425
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,140
He's an unsophisticated person.

426
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,177
It's even harder to understand!

427
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,583
Conan seems to have lost
a lot of confidence.

429
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,653
Yeah, he's so off this time.

430
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,190
I hope he doesn't get sulky
and become a juvenile delinquent!

432
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,325
It's possible.

433
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,928
That doesn't sound good at all...

434
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,431
Temporary Closure

435
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,201
Are you sure
you don't want to come along?

437
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,137
No, because a friend of mine
has been bugging me

439
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,705
to spend the night at his place.

440
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:41,940
Have a nice trlp!

441
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,647
In the past, going on a trip to a hot spring
was unthinkable, even for a day.

443
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,183
This is all thanks to the business flourishing.

444
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,518
Rather, to Mr. Kamekura.

445
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,189
I'm really glad
that such a good man has come.

447
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,392
Okay, everyone's left!

448
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,529
Now, all we have to do is
wait for Mr. Kamekura to come home!

450
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,732
Are you going to wait one whole night
if he doesn't come back...!

452
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,402
What are you going to tell your parents?

453
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,404
Agh! He's back

454
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,846
So, we go in there when the time is right

455
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:24,049
and use this key
that I borrowed from Rintaro to go inside,

457
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,585
and catch Kamekura in the act!

458
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,790
Conan, you're not your spirited self.

459
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,735
I've been digging day after day,

460
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,071
but I haven't seen a glimpse of anything...

461
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,040
I shouldn't have buried it so deep

462
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:50,942
ASH?!

463
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,611
There it is!!

464
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,880
I did it!!

465
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:00,619
I did it, the loot, the loot!

466
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,490
Wow!

467
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,027
That's it, mister!

468
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,296
Huh?! Whaaaaa!

469
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:16,034
We have clearly confirmed the jewelry
that had been buried.

471
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,239
I'm sorry.

472
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,710
Oh, uh, well, we're not the police...

473
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,746
Come on, Conan...

474
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,814
Huh? Come on, what?

475
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,486
Aren't you going to thrust your deduction
at the criminal?!

477
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,622
We'll let you have the best part.

478
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,959
Because you had no room
for highlight this time!

480
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,361
I've got nothing to thrust at him!

481
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,030
Come, get on with it!

482
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,698
Give it your best shot, Conan!

483
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,035
Mr. Kamekura,

484
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,371
5 years ago, you broke into a jewelry shop

485
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,707
and stole 3 billion yen worth of jewelry...

486
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:57,909
Exactly.

487
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,578
See, he admits it.

488
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,281
But, I'm no dunce.

489
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,151
I knew that if I'soldathem off right away,
I would be caught,

491
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,021
I had my eyes fixed
on the re-building construction

493
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,557
that was underway.

494
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:16,027
I buried the jewelry under the floor
and fled...

496
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,899
Then, I worked day after day
so the police wouldn't suspect me.

498
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,970
I endured everything,
being shouted at, being hit and all.

500
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,706
All my friends
couldn't bear the apprenticeship

502
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,541
and quit one after the other.

503
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,176
But I stuck it out!

504
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:32,844
Thinking, 5 years...

505
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,815
after 5 years the 3 billion yen worth
of jewelry will be mine...

507
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:43,288
This was what had't'ept me going
through all the tough times.

509
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,092
And, finally the 5 years that I've waited
for all this time had come!

511
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,894
I just couldn't wait till the time expired,

512
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,963
I just had to dig it up as soon as possible!

513
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:55,033
You figured that if you worked here
as a live-in employee,

515
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,435
you'd have the chance to dig it out...

516
00:18:58,604 --> 00:18:59,704
But, it didn't go that easily...

517
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,874
Since there were no customers,
the shop was always slow

519
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,111
and the members of the family were
always rolling around on the floor.

521
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,815
If this keeps up you'll never get around
to digging up the loot...

523
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,351
Having no other choice,

524
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,287
you renovated the shop
with the money you had saved working,

526
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,890
taught them the cooking

527
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,091
that you had learned
under apprenticeship,

529
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,861
and by making business flourish,

530
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,463
you succeeded in
chasing the entire family

532
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,966
out of the living room.

533
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:32,103
You were finally able to work
on digging up the jewelry

535
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,571
that you buried.

536
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,509
Isn't that right, Mr. Yuji Kamekura?

537
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,545
It's exactly as you say.

538
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,013
Ithoughtso!

539
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,882
Our deduction was right on the ball!

540
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,951
I just can't figure it out, please tell me!

541
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,621
Why did you rush to dig it up,
Just because

543
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,023
a bunch of grade school kids
pushed you from behind?!

545
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,559
I'm really chicken...

546
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,594
Even if you're only inf grade school,

547
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,963
the minute I heard that you guys were
the detective squad, I got scared...

549
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,100
I see.

550
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,235
What's there to be afraid of!

551
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,438
An adult being afraid of a detective squad
of a bunch of kids!!

553
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,774
If you had thought up sending them off
to a hot spring trlp,

555
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,510
why didn't you carry it out
in the first place!

557
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,212
Huh?

558
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,215
It would've been faster, cheaper
and easier

560
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,752
if you just gave them a voucher for 3 mp
and send the whole family off,

562
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,221
than to go out of your way,

563
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,391
dish cash out of your own pocket,
renovate the shop, and help it flourish

565
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,126
Oh, that's true.

567
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:29,928
That's right!

568
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,531
I guess so, now that you mentioned it.

569
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,066
You guess so...

570
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,002
It never even dawned on me...

571
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:39,404
What...?!

572
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:42,807
I guess the case is closed...

573
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:43,808
Al?!

574
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,077
Convinced?

576
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,317
Didn't I tell you that
the person you're dealing with this time

578
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:53,985
is unsophisticated.

579
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,724
They've come. I called them...

580
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,794
I wonder if they'll award us

581
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,996
with the Tokyo Police Commissioner Award?

582
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,030
It would be nice if they did.

583
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,298
Sure would.

584
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,067
I'm pretty sure they will.

585
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,736
After all, you've carried out
fantastic good deed, eheh, heh...

587
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:13,638
You do?

588
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,980
I hate this...

589
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:25,617
I don't feel a least bit good
even after the case is solved...

591
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:30,088
I hate it!!!

We received a letter offathanks award
.from the police

636
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,380
for cooperating in the arrest
of a jewelry'thief

638
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,983
Just before his duration of prescription
was about to expire...

640
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,287
We did it, didn't we!

642
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,923
It was really easy this time!

643
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,226
Uh, I've got something
I'd like to tell you guys.

645
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,261
HUD.

646
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,731
Not all the criminals are going to be
a fool like this one, you know!

648
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,201
It's dangerous just barging in,
Just us kids!

650
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,136
Be more careful next time, understand!

651
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:26,004
HUD?

652
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:29,641
You sure don't sound like your usual self,
Conan!

654
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:34,879
Conan, so you're that vexed
that we got the upper hand this time?

656
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,782
Genta! Don't talk like that

657
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,817
because Conan is hurt!

658
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,655
Conan, cheer up.

659
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,124
I'm so sorry, Conan. That's a good boy...

661
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:48,593
You idiot!!

662
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,329
I'm a specialist-of. decent crimes

663

and em spams.

665
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,958
H, He's dead.
