1
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:53,846
Unsettled Police Department
12 Million Hostages

3
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,217
A.A bomb!

4
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,953
On the ceiling of this elevator?

5
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,724
A.Are you sure about that, Conan?

6
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:10,096
Yep! I saw-! bomb
that looks just like this one on TV!

8
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,165
I heard that.if it's just one
type of liquid it's okay,

10
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,503
but when it mixes with the other liquid
it turns into avery strong bomb!

12
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:22,308
Hen, wouldn't it-be.more the reason
to have the rescue squad come here?

14
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:26,379
I just said that the
mercury lever is set, didn't I?

16
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,749
It's most likely that the switch went on.

17
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,083
With the impact of the elevator
stopping just a while ago

19
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,289
The switch of the trigger device that
will go off with the slightest shake

21
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:41,660
So if you climb up to this roof

22
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,230
or if the rescue squad comes
down here with a

24
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,298
the minute they set
foot on the ground

26
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,334
and even if it shakes just a little bit...

27
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,469
it's BOOM!

28
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,240
Is ity that strong?

29
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,475
The mercury lever...

30
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,412
Mercury lever...

31
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,616
Just as I thought!

32
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:07,720
I'm sur hatgthe one who set this up is
the same bomber as three years ago!

34
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,159
Then, don't tell me that...

35
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,326
It can't be!

36
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:20,099
Then, why don't we have them lower
a rope from the elevator door above

38
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,168
and we both climb and escape...

39
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:23,668
I don't think

40
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:24,737
that will work either

41
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:25,504
What!

42
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:30,109
There's wire tap near the bomb...

43
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,945
I'm sure that the bomber is
near by us and listening

45
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,713
to our conversation from somewhere.

46
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,451
And the minute we leave here and he
stops hearing our conversation

48
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,220
he's planning to turn on the
switch and set the bomb off

50
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,458
Which means
we're trapped either way...

52
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,094
No. we still have cane way out

53
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:54,100
I disassemble this bomb!

54
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:57,837
I need them to lower the bomb
disposal tool from above though!

56
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,710
I repeat, all citizens
within the vicinity of Toto Tower,

58
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:08,948
please follow theflnstructionsé
of the police and evacuate to safely!

60
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:09,949
What!

61
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,216
What!

62
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,284
Are we running away?

63
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,488
But Conan and
Officer Takagi Te still in there<

65
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:22,328
NO need to worry; because those two
are probably heading this way already

67
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:26,132
Officer Chiba, please take
the children to a safe place!

69
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:26,765
Okay!

70
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,637
The two are going to
dispose the bomb right?

72
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:32,671
What?

75
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:39,278
The bomb disposal squad is
not evensggoing into the tower

78
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,379
and are waitingifor communication,
so that's what it means. right?

82
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,349
They'll be okay!

83
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,485
The composition of the bomb is
virtually the same as the one

85
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:50,422
that was set up in Beika €huo
Hospital 3 years ago so

87
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,926
those two will somehow
work something out!

89
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,561
Yes. I guess so.

90
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:01,400
As long as they don't lend an ear to the
voice of the devil, like 3 years ago

92
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,006
Let it down slowly!

93
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,775
Easy now, easy

94
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,878
Okay! Okay!

95
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,482
Are you all right?

96
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,717
Okay. I got it!

97
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:21,854
Roger!

98
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,790
We've completed
giving the equipment!

100
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,125
Okay!

101
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,727
Okay, Officer Takagi,
Iet's start!

103
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,530
Y.Yes, sir

104
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,531
You fool!

105
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,801
Shape up and stop panicking

106
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,371
The one who's going to do the actual
work is the boy that is with you!

108
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,775
If you get flustered
you may make the boy

110
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,543
anxious and that may
call for careless/mistakes!

112
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,344
Yes, sir

113
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:46,946
Don't worry.

114
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,583
If you take it easy and follow our
instructions, it'll finish in no time at all

116
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,218
Calm down!

117
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,619
I understand!

118
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,254
Okay, first of all...

119
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,624
Let's start by removing the
photosensitive trigger device!

121
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,391
Yes, sir

122
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,796
We will turn off the elevator
Iights in a minute from now, so

124
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,465
put on the infrared night scope.

125
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:13,072
When it gets dark remove the
mercury lever's right side cover!

127
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,741
Be carefulnnotito touch
the mercury lever!

129
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,612
First we remove the cover, right

130
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,715
Right!
We'll turn off the lights now!

132
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,418
Did:you get that, Conan?

133
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,290
C,Conan?

134
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,993
Here it is!
The light sensitive tube!

136
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:37,062
If I cut the cord...

137
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,400
What a relief...

138
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,036
Conan, can you hear me?

139
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:47,239
Yep!
I can hear you, so keep on going!

141
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,475
Yeah...uh...let's see...

142
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:54,379
If you take off the cover you
can see a lot of machines. right?

144
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,614
Just above those machines

145
00:06:55,682 --> 00:07:01,552
should see a device that moves when it
detects. light called a light sensitive tube.

147
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:05,391
First of all cut the cord that is
sticking out of the light sensitive tube

149
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,426
Then, I turnrtnis...

150
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,197
Electricity's flowing!

151
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,199
Watch. out, watch out

152
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:19,271
Okay, then, I'll place the plastic plate
in this space and use it as a stopper

154
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,006
Stopper?

155
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,908
Come to think of it...

156
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:27,046
That code "Getting a good stopper
IS not going to help.

158
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,447
That's what..it said...

159
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:33,919
Good stopper
probably means earned run average 3

161
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:40,626
But.-why a major leaguer?
This is Japan...

163
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,462
He could've just
written pro baseball player

165
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,398
Wait a sec!

166
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,035
Extended game. earned run average...

167
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:54,173
Turn over, Major Leaguer...

168
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:58,410
Don't: tell me that, the
other bomb is located at...

170
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,649
There's still a lot of time but...

171
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,919
unless I figure out where it is...

172
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,259
Now listen, Conan, when you're
finished 'what you're doing. next

174
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,561
Uh, Officer Takag:...

175
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,097
What is it. Conan...

176
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:22,000
I have something
I want to discuss with you

178
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,740
Hey. what. what's going on ?

179
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,275
Now it's the helicopters
of the TV stations!

181
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,945
I wonder if something's
happened after all...

183
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:33,645
Hey!

184
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,647
Oh, bummer!

185
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,984
We're having a test now!
Be quiet!

187
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,754
The time now is 11:40!

188
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,591
There is less than 20 minutes to go,
before the bomb is to go off!

190
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,795
The boy and the police
officer who are trapped

192
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,797
together with.thesbomb
havggnot'been rescued yet!

194
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,332
Time is definitely ticking away!

195
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,202
What will become
of the boy.and police officer

197
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:03,575
Will they perish
together with the symbol of Tokyo?

199
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:10,749
What! He can't cut the cord!
There are only three more left!

201
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,284
First the yellow cord to

202
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:14,787
switeh off the liquid crystal panel!

203
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:18,190
Next the white cord that is connected
to the mercury lever!

205
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:23,061
And the black telephone cord that is
set there for remote control manipulation

207
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,731
If you cut it in that order the
bomb will stop completely!

209
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:31,069
How come you can't.do that when
you've already gone that far!

211
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,271
Give me that!

212
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:34,206
Officer Takag!!
Just what are you doing?

214
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,375
Hurry!
Hurry and cut it!

216
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,577
N No, we can't cut it...

217
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:42,614
Just what are you talking about?
You've only got 10 minutes left

219
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,950
Gallant police officer...

220
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,556
I shall reward you for your courage...

221
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,424
I will tell you the place where the

222
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,060
great fireworks will
color the sky after the game

224
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,664
It will be displayed 3 seconds
before the bomb goes off

226
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,532
Good luck...

227
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:06,305
Conan says these are the words that
are displayed on the LCD panel

229
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,576
I would at least like to get
Conan to evacuate somehow, but

231
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:13,178
in order to specify the other
place where the bomb is set,

233
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,247
and to avoid a large
number of casualties

235
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,282
there seems to be no other
choice than for Conan to

237
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:23,322
Iook at t;e hint and for me.to
relay the location by phone

239
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,593
I'm sorry...

240
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,395
Officer Takagi

241
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:35,300
But, you understand,
don't you Officer Sato?

243
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:38,803
You fool...

244
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:45,744
4 minutes to go! There's 'only 4 more
minutes till the bombygeeés off!

246
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,615
The timer has not been stopped yet.
Mr. Bomber!

248
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:54,653
If you are watching this broadcast.
Please stop the timer, please!

250
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,657
If you have a tinge of
conscience left in you...

252
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,127
Heck with conscience

253
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:08,000
I#ll"still can't believe that it's
all working out so well...

255
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,370
Then. why don't you pick the
broadcast of the TV on radio

257
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,572
andalisten to our heroic story

259
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,278
The timer of the bomb is still moving

260
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,012
What?

261
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,914
Mr. Bomber, are you watching!

262
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:25,751
D.Don't tell me the
remote control didn't work right!

264
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,085
Let them be

265
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,021
We got the money already besides

266
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:33,058
1.I'm going to g
o tell the police how to

268
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:33,457
Hey!

269
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,726
I'm going to go tell them!

270
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,262
Hey. stop!

271
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,543
The police, those cops...

272
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:56,748
Took advantage
of his conscience and.

274
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,319
I feel sorry for the brat, but...

275
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,420
If the bomb goes off,

276
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,222
the police will be blamed for
not being able to save the kid.

278
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,625
If they go chicken and stop the bomb
before it explodesthey lose the hint

280
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,428
and a greater number of
casualties is inevitable

282
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,735
I'm going to, make
this publicito.the media

284
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:21,473
and colossal blunder of the police
will be exposed in broad daylight

286
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,775
Either way. you're finished

287
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,711
you dang police...

288
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:35,087
Oh, that code had such a meaning...

289
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,626
If you talk too loud,
the bomber will hear us

291
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:47,099
Yeah, but there are more than 400
places in Tokyo that fit into that category

293
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:53,872
Yep, it would be impossible to
check all the places from now

295
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,040
without the bomber noticing...

296
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:02,247
If we try to evacuate all the people
that are at the more than 400 locations

298
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,249
judging from the bomber's
character, he will probably

300
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,284
turn the switch on
using remote control...

302
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:11,690
In other words,
to definitely save everybody

304
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:16,161
we've no other choice
but to look at the hint

306
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,529
we've no other
choice but to look at the hint...

308
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,801
Just like Officer Matsuda did, right?

309
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,370
Yep and besides

310
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:28,540
the person that I don't
want to let die no matter what,

312
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,577
the person that I don't
want to let die no matter what.

314
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,348
I'm sorry Officer Takagi

315
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,949
It's fine...

316
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,353
Hey, Conan

317
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:44,890
While you're at it,
tell me one more thing, will you

319
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:50,062
WwW. Who on earth are you?

320
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,199
Oh, if you want to know...

321
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,503
I'll tell you...

322
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,478
In the world beyond

323
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,947
The two have notrbeensrescued yet

324
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,451
There is only a minute left,
The seconds are ticking away!

326
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,418
Wait a second!

327
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:18,356
What's going on!
Conan and Officer Takagi are still inside!

329
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,591
Oh. well...

330
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:23,795
Seems that the members of the riot task
force has also been ordered to evacuate!

332
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:24,563
What!

333
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,932
Take the car back to Toto Tower!

334
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,234
Hey. it's dangerous. dangerous!

335
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,136
Take the car back!
Hey. Chiba!

337
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,338
Take the car back!
Take it back!

339
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,706
They listened to it...

340
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:39,111
The same words of the devil,
as 3 years ago.

342
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,854
You guys, the Youth Detective Squad can
handle it. evenYif I'm not around. right?

344
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,257
C.Conan!

345
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,594
15 seconds to go...

346
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,463
Are you ready, Officer Takagi?

347
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,297
Yeah...

348
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:03,235
I wrote all your
deductions in the mail

350
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:06,171
All I have, left to do now is to punch in
the hintiyou're going to read and

352
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,506
send it out...

353
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,408
It's going to be coming out soon!

354
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,576
The first letter is...

355
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,045
The letter "E"

359
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,186
N No!

360
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,930
Get out of there...
get out of there!

362
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,366
Get out of there, Ran!

363
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,403
SShinichu?

364
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,273
Ran!

365
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,447
Takag!

366
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,994
Conan? Hurry. what's next!

367
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:13,205
WwW. What the. the slightest
shake will set the bomb off!

369
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,573
What the...

370
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:18,977
I was too scared to die af er all,
sO I cut the rest of the cord.

372
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:19,578
What!

373
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,813
I'm sorry...

374
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,755
Then, you stopped
partway through the hint...

376
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,756
Yep!

377
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,391
With only the letters EVIT,
we can't

379
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,228
tell where the other bomb is.

380
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,064
Well, it can't be helped...

381
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:42,601
Let's call the rescue squad
and have them come rescue us!

383
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,738
So. they went chicken after all...

384
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:50,508
The kid's the one who stopped
the bomb, but the people will think

386
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,744
the police made him stop it...

387
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,414
They'll think that the police sacrificed
the lives of a lot of people

389
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,784
just to save their own skin!

391
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,125
Please listen to the people cheer!

392
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,628
The bomb:has safely been stopped!

393
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:13,598
Moreover, the one who disassembled
the:bomb was boy who was

395
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,967
trapped in the elevator!

396
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,570
Let's ask the boy some questions then!

397
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,405
I'll bet you were scared. sonny?

399
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,211
Sfihiriichi?

400
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:31,116
But the police taught
me how to do it really well, so

402
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,218
I-had an-easy time taring it apart!

403
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,687
Officer Takagi

404
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,625
Officer Sato...

405
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:41,493
You fool!

406
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,361
Don't blame yourself

407
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:47,799
Two hours and a half left to go!
Let's go look for the other bomb!

409
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,834
Oh, but the thing is...

410
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,777
I'm glad you're okay!

411
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:02,314
I knew you'd do it. Conan!

412
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,482
Just as would-be
expected-of my following!

414
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,087
Well, you did right to stop the bomb

415
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:14,259
It's a silly thing to sacrifice your
Iife for people you don't even know

417
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,461
Yeah. I guess so

418
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,700
I'm sure that's
what th) bomber thought too {

420
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,975
finally only one more subject to go...

421
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,246
What's the matter. Ran?
You look depressed

423
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,416
The next subject is
your best sub™@ct, Japanese

425
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,956
I was just thinking that there sure are
a-lot.of cars going in and out today.

428
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,225
It's probably because they
kor yelling) Wh [ling ) foe) loko

431
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,793
into-the warehouse
of the gym in the basement!

434
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,662
It seems that the next ping-pong

435
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:50,962
It seems that the next ping-pong

436
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,164
tournament is going
to be held at our school

438
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:57,535
While they're atdit, they should
take the space-consuming

440
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,804
drum cans that are .inside the
warehouse with them too.

442
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,573
What are you talking about?

443
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,607
Don't you know?

444
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:08,747
[Because of those Sbig cans
it's so hard to take-out» the tennis net

446
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,818
so they couldn't find it after all...

447
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,922
Oh well, eveniif they were to find.itenow,
they wouldn't be able to evacuate

449
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:23,294
There's only 5 seconds left to go!

450
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:24,695
Four /

451
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,897
Three,

454
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:29,834
Zero

455
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,037
BOOM!

456
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:33,972
What!

457
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,940
WwW. Why?

458
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,009
Why isn't it exploding?

459
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,977
Dant, it ant be helped!

463
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,111
Dant. it an't be helped!

464
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,846
I'll have toset the
bomb off with remote control

466
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,520
I'm sorry to say

467
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,522
the guy you called
can't pick up th phone

469
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:55,627
The bomb disposal squad secretly went
into school quietly taking

471
00:19:55,628 --> 00:20:00,365
care not to leave any voices on
the wiretap that you set up

473
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:06,070
and took apart all 5 of the bombs
that you set up in the drum cans

476
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:11,309
Oh, you look as if you're wondering
how we located the bombs?

478
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:18,883
We deciphered the code you sent of Toto
Tower and the time of bombing as follow

480
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,454
RE gp
I am a Major Leaguer, a
strong pitcher as well as batter

484
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,789
Here goes the beginning
of an extended game

486
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:30,862
No use getting ready a good stopper,
I'm winning in the end

488
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:35,733
The phrase Major Leaguer means to
change everything into English

490
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:40,405
A good stopper means, a pitcher
with good earned run average

492
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,642
Extended game in English is
called Extra inning game

494
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:48,713
the abbreviation of
earned run average is ERA

496
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:56,421
If you remove-the 'no-use words "ERA"
from the word EXTRA. you get XT!

498
00:20:56,856 --> 00:21:00,692
XT is written vertically
and when it is turned over

500
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,594
it becomes the
Japanese Kanji character!

502
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,530
That's the map symbol
that stands for school!

504
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,969
And the hint that was displayed on the
LCD panel of the first bomb,

506
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:15,006
EVIT. is the English spelling of

507
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:19,477
DETECTIVE, that is,
a part of it, spelled reverse

509
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:23,815
If you reverse detective ~you get Teitan

510
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,085
The school with the name Teitan
has a grade school,

512
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,754
intermediate school,
high school and university,

514
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:33,224
the only school where a lot of students
gather during winter vacation is only

516
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,527
Teitan High School that is

517
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:39,197
holding national trial exams...

518
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:43,835
You didn't plant a fake bomb at
the baseball park is because

520
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,070
you wanted to
keep everyone's attention

522
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,139
away from the schools
with baseball grounds

524
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:51,876
Well, but I guess you took us
Iightly looking through your

526
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,211
binoculars from a A
conspicuous place like this,

528
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,915
keeping watch over
Teitan High School. You lose this time

530
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,387
Look out!

531
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,156
Oh no!

532
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,868
Officer Sato!

533
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:32,083
Dang it!

534
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:32,884
Dang it!

535
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:53,438

WwW. Wait!
I.I'm not!

539
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:31,108
It's,one of those things that
occur frequently, I heard it in my head

541
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,011
a child's voice...

542
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:36,147
It, It told me to Kill the police

543
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:39,217
No. it told me to kill anybody

544
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,489
T:That why it's not my fault!

545
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,993
To think that he
was killed-by a guy like this

547
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,766
A guy like this!

548
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,701
To a guy like this!

549
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,047
Officcer Sato!

551
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:26,731

To,think that he had to die for a
guy like that! So, let me go!

559
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,685
Just what do you
think you're doing. Officer Sato

561
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,124
Wasn't it you who always said

562
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:57,962
contribute to the nation and the citizens
with pride and'a sense off mission,

564
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,231
never to-¢ringe in fear and hate

565
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:03,301
and 'at all times to
respect the rights of people,

567
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,704
and perform our duties
as police officers wit justice

569
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,272
That's what you always said. right!

570
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,915
But: bit...

571
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:18,449

00:25:19,984 --> 00:25:23,788
Acting the way you are now, I'm sure
that Office Wiatsuda will scold you

574
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,891

Ou shouldn't, forget him...

579
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,418
If it's a precious memory, /
you shouldn't forget it

581
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:59,724
Once a person dies, that person can
only live within one's memory

583
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,394
Officer Takagi...

584
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,730

Well um...

588
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,389
Hired one warning shot...

589
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:34,392

that you stopped it

638
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,895
You had less than 3
seconds to cut the cord, didn't you?

640
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:24,302
Well, I kind of figured it out
partway through the hint so

642
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:27,204
Besides. I couldn't
afford to let Officer Takagi die

644
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:31,608
But, you're really something, to
figure out that just by seeing

EVIT" it's the reverse of DETECTIVE
You can say that again!

648
