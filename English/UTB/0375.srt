stole his cell phone
and was keying in the will.

172
00:07:14,454 --> 00:07:18,023
Mr. Futagawa deliberately
took out one cigarette

174
00:07:18,057 --> 00:07:19,158
from another cigarette caso that he had.

175
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:20,359
And put that extra cigarette into the original
cigarette case with the 6 cigarettes inside it,

177
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,828
and completed the message.

178
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:25,164
I feel that this 1s indeed a dying message!

dying message applied to him...

That's strange...

00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:15,701
If tho killor left such 1 will behind
and killed him,

285
00:10:15,735 --> 00:10:18,603
It should be around somewhere.

That's more: than enough motive.

446
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:08,159
Ms. Nonomiya said
she passed us In the forest

448
00:15:08,427 --> 00:15:10,629
She colldn'l possibly have gone up
the hill before us,

meet Mr. Futagawa and
push him oft the chff!

452

But whon Mr Futagawa fell off,
all three of you ran right over..didn't you?

If somaetrody was watching
that from on top of the cliff .

Soon from on top the chff wore
only three little lights the slzc of a bean.

In other words,
by means of elimination...

463
00:15:34,086 --> 00:15:38,073
the only one capablo of'being the killer 1s,
Mr. Futagawa's boss and editor, you

465
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:40,692
Mr sHaoihachi Mikami, right?

466
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:45,614
Ha. ha, ha

467
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:48,750
If the other two aren't the killer,
you say that it's me?!

00:15:48,968 --> 00:15:50,702
Ha ha, ha

470
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,173
But, Mr. Futagawa was
holding 7 cigarettes!

472
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:58,543
That was a message pointing out
your name Helhachi!

474
00:15:58,778 --> 00:16:00,045
It's only a coincidence...

475
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:04,082
And, besides. why do I have to go
and kill Futagawa?

477
00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:08,503
If he did kill the guy called Kono
a ear ago. then the more so.

479
00:16:08,888 --> 00:16:12,791
I have no obligation to avenge the doth
of a person that I've met for the first time...

rule

482
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,997

517

Mr. Futagawa increased the numbaor of
cigarettes to make it easier to understand...

519
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:07,812
He chose the same brand Hf cigarette
because the killer for both Incidents was

00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:50,622

that should've boen there either.

573
00:17:50,823 --> 00:17:51,723
that should've been there either.

575
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:52,924
Something that should've been there?

576
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:55,059
The heavy-weight for the.telescope.

577
00:17:55,961 --> 00:18:01,199
. Lens barreland removed thesheavy-weight!

578
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,269
In order-to keep tho woighlt

Right

595
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:25,056
I went out of my way to look after him
and see that he made it to the desk,

597
00:18:25,057 --> 00:18:26,991
yet he had the nerve to say
to pay him 50.000.000 yen

599
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:29,493
If I wanted him to keep his mouth shut
about the murder

601
00:18:29,994 --> 00:18:33,298
All I did was punish Kono
for not being grateful...

603
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:34,432
Punished him!

604
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:36,201
J.Just what do you mean!

605
00:18:37,136 --> 00:18:38,386
A comet

606
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,577
A year ago, that day. the guy named Kono
came to ask me a favor.

608
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:50,615
He asked me to verify whethor
the comet he found was a new one or not.

610
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,035
You moan tho comaot that
was named after you ..7

612
00:18:54,787 --> 00:18:57,889
It was found by that man and
I confirmed it on that cliff

614
00:18:57,923 --> 00:18:59,089
It was found by that nan and
I confirmed It on that cliff

Don't tell me that you killod Asao 80 that
you could hog that comet all for yoursclf?!

621
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:09,067
I asked him to put my name on the comet,
of course. But that go

623
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:10,568
Talk about ungrateful

624
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:12,303
No. I can't...

625
00:19:12,338 --> 00:19:13,505
No. I can't .

626
00:19:14,138 --> 00:19:16,608
Wo'va: already decided that
the name of the star Is

628
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:18,810
AmafsLIciAI, Nonomiya. Kono comet.

629
00:19:19,445 --> 00:19:21,579
What?! I thought...

630
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:26,951
Com  to think of it
he mentioned that the time's finally,come

632
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:30,154
I thought that he-found somebody else...

633
00:19:30,455 --> 00:19:34,041
It was a dream
I've held since childhood too!

635
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,595
And yet he refused to listen to me .

636
00:19:38,097 --> 00:19:40,732
Op AEE) WER PE) er ae) er yd 1
before he does

638
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:42,634
and headed back for the pension

639
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:45,703
Then, that guy came clinging onto me
80 I brushed him away...

641
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:47,454
and he fell off the cliff...

642
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:51,943
Then, later when you came here again
In order to hasten skeletonizing

644
00:19:51,944 --> 00:19:54,879
of the corpse you poured lime ove .it.- ght?
