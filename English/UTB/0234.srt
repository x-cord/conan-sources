1
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:03,169
Even destiny serves as
a clue to deduction

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,471
and the light of truth pierces through
the most mysterious case.

5
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,173
Champion dog Doyle disappears.

6
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:08,741
The real faces of the breeders
are revealed.

8
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,177
He sees through the one and only truth

9
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,879
A Child in
appearance with the I.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,615
no case is left
unsolved with Detective Conan.

13
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,183
We visited the residence of
Teruya Kanoh, a friend of Dr. Agasa

15
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:01,020
whotinyited us over
because-he wanted to give away

17
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,622
things he didn't need to his friends,
before moving to England.

19
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:07,994
At his house, we meet his friends
Mr. Yoshio Tsunashima,

21
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,329
Ms. Aki Tosasbayashl,

22
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,965
and Ms. Shino Hasukl.

23
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:17,403
Amidst the exchange of
various complicated feelings,

25
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,272
one of the Papillons,

26
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,808
named Doyle disappears out of the blue!

27
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,445
Moreover,

28
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,881
the burnt black piece of Doyle's collar,

29
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:33,052
that has been cut with a knife is found
in the incinerator!

31
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,521
D,Don't tell me that's...

32
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,555
Doyle s...

33
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,358
No...It can't be...

34
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,659
No ..It can't be...

35
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:46,632
Huh?

36
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:47,700
That's strange...

37
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,969
JUSt a while ago

38
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,071
there were only blue cushions.

39
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,042
Counting the one that Arthur brought oVer,
makes three blue cushions...

41
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,845
One extra cushion...

42
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,648
What does this all mean...

43
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:10,823
The Non-Vanishing Evidence Part II

44
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:16,195
Doyle,

45
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,697
at the chime of the clock
which struck 1200 noon,

47
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,900
headed for the Japanese room
here he could get his snack

49
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,535
and disappeared from our view...

50
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,470
After that.

51
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:29,308
We all followed Mr Kanoh who went into
the kitchen to get the cheese snack

53
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,876
Then

54
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,712
we went to the Japanese room
and found that that Doyle was not there.

56
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,649
So, we split up
and looked all over the house for Doyle...

58
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,317
This is approximately
how the layout of the house is

60
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,054
We don't ream know
who searched where yet...

62
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:43,756
But,

63
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,425
where on earth
did the person hide Doyle..

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,561
And,

66
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,831
how in the world is that person
planning to carry Doyle out of here?!

68
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,568
Looks like your time to
prepare to move IS running out.

70
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,603
Yes. . .that's ok.

71
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:58,904
Move?

73
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,508
you said that you're giving us
the things you don't need

75
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,577
because you're going to be moving away

76
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,445
but can we take the things we want,
home with us today?

78
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,515
Y,Yeah...sure...

79
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,984
Are all the other people going to take
their things home with them today too?

81
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,152
N04.

82
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,822
I'm going to be sending Mr. Tsunashima's
clock to his residence tomorrow.

84
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,458
Ms. Hasuki's stereo will be sent to
her house 10 days later,

86
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,260
which will be the day before I move...

87
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,528
I never use any of the stuff,

88
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,364
so I told them
that I could send the goods right away,

90
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,399
but they both came today

91
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,902
because I happened to find
more antui'ques in the closet

93
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,137
and they wanted to take a look.

94
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:31,570
Debl ll

95
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:31,971
ayashl

98
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,539
As for Ms. Tosabayashi who showed up
out of the blue today,
ayashl

103
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,841
Judging from her personality and all,
Jdebl ll

107
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,010
I'm sure she's going to take
that flower vase home with her today...

111
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:39,445
That flower vase

112
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,013
if I remember correctly was
in the living room!

114
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:41,780
Don't tell me that...!

115
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,751
Doyle is in that...

116
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,525
Of course not...

117
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,296
A living creature couldn't possibly
be hidden in a stereo

119
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,398
that is supposed to be shipped out
10 days from now, either...

121
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,034
The wall clock in the Japanese room...

122
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,305
It's impossible to hide a dog
in there either...

124
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:08,274
HUD.

125
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,242
That clock is 5 minutes slow...

126
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:10,643
HUN?

127
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,846
Strange...

128
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,549
after it was repaired,
it was always accurate...

130
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,350
Wait a sec...

131
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,985
Wheml looked a while ago .

132
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,657
What's this cotton like thing?

133
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,692
It looks like some sort of chemical fiber...

134
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:28,527
Hey,

135
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,528
Iet me see it...

136
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,131
This is...

137
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,668
That glittering cotton was
on the blue cushion

139
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,903
that Arthur was holding too...

140
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,472
W Wait a sec...

141
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,675
Come to think of it, I've seen this
some place too...

143
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,278
T,The incinerator

144
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,984
What's the matter Conan?

145
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,554
Was Doyle burned in there, after all?

146
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,093
When I saw it a while ago,
I just thought it was plain trash,

148
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,196
but this is definitely glass wool!

149
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,664
It's sound absorption material

150
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,266
I see...

151
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,703
so, that's what the person used

152
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,905
Uh, Conan!

153
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,908
I've figured out where Doyle is hidden,

154
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,478
as well as how and why.

155
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,015
I've also figured out who did it too!!

157
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,520
It's this late already...

158
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,424
I've got to get going home.

159
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,326
Me too,

160
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,095
since I've ot to start
getting dinner ready...

162
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,963
P,Please wait

163
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,633
Well, I guess you were just unlucky.

164
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,401
I suggest you forget about that doggie.

165
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,370
0 Oh. no...

166
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,408
T,This is the sound of...

167
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,810
The clock in the Japanese room...

168
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,014
It's only supposed to ring at 12:00 noon...

169
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,982
What's going on?!

170
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,222
C,Conan'?!

171
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,158
It worked. Conan!

172
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,595
We'll go get things ready
in the living room, then!

174
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,396
Okay!

175
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:11,830
Get things ready?

176
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,500
We're going to try an experiment!

177
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:18,237
To see if the person
who hid Doyle could really do so

179
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:21,073
without being seen by anyone.

180
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,908
How foolish,

181
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,577
when we haven't even found Doyle yet...

182
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:27,146
Of course,

183
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,480
the star of the experiment is...

184
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,016
Doyle, here!!

185
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,251
Huh?!

186
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,119
Â«DoyleH

187
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,089
You found him!!

188
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:40,826
I'm glad

189
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,031
Okay,

190
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,599
Iet's start the experiment then.

191
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,869
Doyle disappeared from our sight...

192
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,972
from the corridor
in front of the front entrance...

194
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,943
Darn,

195
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,447
the dog's been found,
soianthatenough!

197
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:05,284
I don't have time to be fooling around
With a child's detectivesggame either.

199
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,319
Well, well...

200
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:11,357
Okay, Mitsuhiko, you can start!

201
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,624
R0 er!

202
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,063
N,Not again...

203
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,835
Yes, first Doyle...

204
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,837
after hearing the chlme of the clock,

205
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,673
headed for the Japanese roo'm
where he usually gets his cheese snack.

207
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,176
In the meantime, we went to the kitchen
before going to the Japanese room.

209
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:32,778
Right?

210
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,480
Y Yeah...

211
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,483
Then, where do you think Doyle is now?

212
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:38,717
This is ridiculous!

213
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:39,485
This is ridiculous!

214
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,688
If he was given his snack as usual
in the Japanese room...

216
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,856
Where else would he be,
but the Japanese room...

218
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:48,760
He's not here...

219
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:50,896
Besides,

220
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,265
the sound of the chime
did not come from this room...

222
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,400
Oh, really.

223
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,336
W,What is going on...

224
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,875
The sound of the clock came from
thus Ilving room!

226
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:04,576
The living room...?

227
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,347
D,Don't tell me that's...

228
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,516
From the speaker of the stereo?!

230
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,350
IUD.

231
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:15,387
We rung the chime of the clock
a while ago, recorded it,

233
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,755
and played it on this stereo.

234
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,927
I used the tape recorder that was
in your room, brother!

236
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:26,265
Which means that Doyle, was lured to
the living room by the sound of the clock.

238
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,167
Just the sound won't do.

239
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,234
The cushion's got to be there too.

240
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:30,601
Cushion?

241
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:31,904
Remember,

242
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:36,241
you said that Doyle pulls out his own
cushion at snack time.

244
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:37,876
But,

245
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,879
the blue cushion that Doyle likes was
in the Japanese room just a while ago...

247
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,183
Doyle doesn't necessarily like
blue cushions!

249
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,085
A dog's ear can hear
four times that of humans,

251
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,389
its sense of smell is
far more superior than that of humans.

253
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,724
But its eyes can hardly tell
one color from the other

255
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,361
That's why Doyle always pulled out
the cushion

257
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:00,466
which had his smell on it at snack time,

258
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,634
and that cushion just happened to
be blue.

260
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,837
In other words,

261
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,773
Doyle was not waiting in the Japanese
room at 12:00 noon.

263
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,843
He was trained to think that

264
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,577
if he waited on the cushion
near the sound of the chime of the clock,

266
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,913
he could get his snack!

267
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,082
So,,

268
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,984
the person who schemed this took
advantage of Doyle's habit

270
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,952
and lured him out to the living room!

271
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,524
The cushion that Doyle always used had
bite marks oniit,

273
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:28,560
so it was also easy for the person
to tell~it apart!

275
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,729
But,

276
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,066
I came here to living room right away with
Mr. Tsunashima to look for Doyle,

278
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,969
but saw neither the
cushion nor the dog...

281
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:38,070
Ngnt/

282
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,171
R,Rlght...

283
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,640
There's a good place to hide Doyle...

284
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,441
Huh?

285
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,144
Look,

286
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:49,380
here behind the stereo

287
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,887
Behind the speaker

288
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,960
The person peeled off
the sound absorption material

290
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,462
that was stuck on to the inside of
the speaker beforehand.

292
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,933
Then the person put Doyle's cushion
in the space that was made,

294
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,668
and put the cheese on the cushion.

295
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,305
Of course the right speaker was rigged
so no sound came out from it...

297
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,806
Of course the right speaker was rigged
so no sound came out from it...

299
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:16,975
And the left speaker was rigged

300
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:21,213
so that the sound of the clock that was
recorded beforehand would come out of it.

302
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,348
Doyle,

303
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,484
Iured by the smell of
the cushion and cheese,

305
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,252
as well as the sound of the clock,

306
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,755
went into the right speaker
where the back board was open.

308
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,924
In other words, he was lured inside!

309
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:35,394
If so. wouldn't he come out
after eating the cheese. ?

311
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,262
He was put to sleep with a sleeping pill

312
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,731
that was burled inside the cheese!

313
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,869
I wonder if it would work out
that smoothly...

315
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:47,673
Back then, the clock in the
Japanese room indicated 12:00 noon,

317
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,207
so the real chime should've been
ringing too...

319
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,444
I don't think it rang.

320
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,479
Because.

321
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,648
It was 12:00 midnight!

322
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:57,582
Huh?

323
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:02,553
That clock is made to ring
only at 12:00 noon.

325
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,791
If the hands of the clock
are moved up 12 hours,

327
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:06,959
the chime won't ring!

328
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,562
But, who would do something like that?!

329
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,529
Who else?

330
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:11,964
Hulk!

331
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,733
It can't be anyone else but

332
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,302
Ms. Hasuki who was going
to take this stereo with her, can it?

334
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,871
It, It can't be...

335
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:24,776
She was probably going to put
that doggie in the speaker and steal it.

337
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,579
0,Oh hofiifjlf'awoul "never. . .

338
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,581
W,Wait,

339
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,618
Ms. Hasuki would never do
a thing like that...

341
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:37,356
But, her shoes were
in the yard by the incinerator too.

343
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,255
But...

345
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,461
Ms. Hasuki IS not the one!

346
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,068
Ms. Hasuki is not the one!

347
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,537
What IS this boy talking about?

348
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:57,342
Because that stereo was going to
be sent out on Saturday, right?

350
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:01,413
No one would look a live dog in a
place like that!

352
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,349
If it's not Ms. Hasukl,

353
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,385
why would the dog have been
inside the speaker of the stereo...

355
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:10,288
The person who did it,
didn't want to steal Doyle,

357
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,592
but rather, just wanted Doyle
to disappear for a while.

359
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,460
Disappear for a while?

360
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:20,098
It maybe a blind spot, but if
the back board of the speaker is removed,

362
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,667
it would easily be noticed.

363
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:25,437
That's one of the places
anyone would look when searching...

365
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:26,738
Right...

366
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,008
That's why the person came first thing,
0 IS Mng room,

368
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,544
replaced the back board and hid Doyle...

369
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,481
Isn't that right, Mr. Tsunashima'?!

370
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,254
Since you said that you came here first
thing to look for Doyle,

372
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,322
it would've been easy for you to pretend
that you were searching

374
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,291
behind the speaker
and replace the back board, right?

376
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,726
Come to thunk of It, you said that

377
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:52,097
you looked behind the speaker and
didn't come over this side, didn't you?

379
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:53,832
H Hey...

380
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,501
I'm sure that .

381
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,972
you heard about Doyle's snacking habit
from Mr. Kanoh's parents.

383
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,076
As well as about the
stereo not being used much

385
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,413
And when you came to
this house before...

387
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,016
You peeled off the sound absorption
material behind the speaker

389
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:15,420
and had prepared a place to hide
Doyle beforehand!

391
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,157
All you had to say was that
the speaker didn't sound good to pretend

393
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,127
that you were trying to fix it.
Then nobody would suspect you.

395
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,629
If you were around when Doyle was
eating his snack

397
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,331
you could record
the sound of the chime too...

399
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,769
You put the tape and cushion
behind the stereo...

401
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:34,139
when Ms. Hasuki came before 1200,

402
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,942
and we were all gathered
at the front entrance

404
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:41,747
You then pretended to look for Doyle

405
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,448
and went around behind the speaker.

406
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,485
You removed the collar from Doyle,
who was asleep...

408
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,922
retrieved the cushion
and replaced the back board...

410
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,092
You then put the cushion back
into the Japanese room.

412
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,161
You returned the hands of the clock
that were moved up in time,

414
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,696
back to the accurate time.

415
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,298
You then burned the collar
in the incinerator

417
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,100
and left the back door open.

418
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,970
Because you wanted
everyone to think that

420
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,339
someone who snuck
into the house took Doyle

422
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,807
and fled from the back door!

423
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,142
I see...

424
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,610
It seems that you wanted to

425
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,913
burn the sound absorption material that
you peeled off in the incinerator but...

427
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,050
That's glass wool that is also used
as a heat insulator...

429
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,420
Most of it was left in the incinerator
without being burned!

431
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,022
I see,

432
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,691
that's why
when we made Arthur look for Doyle,

434
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,593
he brought the cushion
from the Japanese room...

436
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,364
Because it was Doyle s cushion
that was replaced.

438
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,501
But, why wasn't Arthur able to tell...

439
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,337
That Doyle was inside the speaker...

440
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,940
He knew but he couldn't go inside,

443
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,441
Because this room was a place

444
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,877
where he was scolded.v'ery harshly
in the past, and had bad memories about.

447
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,045
Oh...

448
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,047
But, sonny,

449
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:53,518
I gain nothing from hiding Doyle
inside the speaker...

451
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,755
What you wanted was not Doyle,

452
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,690
but this, that was on his collar,

453
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:59,457
right?

454
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,626
This gem stone...

455
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:06,231
This is quite an expensive item that...

456
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,899
Mr. Kanoh grandfather had bought
in France.

458
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,435
And, where did you find that?

459
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,338
Behind the pendulum of the wall clock
in the Japanese room!

461
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,441
When I looked at that clock at 12:00,

462
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,410
the time was accurate.

463
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,378
But, when I looked at 15:00,
it was off 3 minutes,

465
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,180
and when I looked at 17:00
it was off 5 minutes

467
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,983
The clock continued to delay
one minute an hour...

469
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,486
That's how I found out

470
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,656
there was something attached
behind the pendulum,

472
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:33,491
as well as the person who attached it

473
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,729
was the one who was to take
the clock home, Mr. Tsunashima.

475
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,763
And, that person is you!!

476
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:40,899
Darn!!

477
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,234
Mr. Tsunashlma'!

478
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:05,924
Darn...

479
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,168
Stop it, Arthur, don't!

480
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,272
You could never hit a dog

481
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,742
because you like dogs, don t you

482
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,611
That's why you didn't kill Doyle, right?

483
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:29,614
You didn't screw the back board
of the speaker back on

485
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,616
because you wanted Doyle to
be able to leave

487
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,451
when he woke up, right?

488
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,287
That's right, isn't it, Conan?

489
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,525
But, Mr. Tsunashima, why...?

490
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:44,129
Money...

491
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,434
I wanted money to take care of my dogs
that multiplied beyond expectation...

493
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,437
If so, you could've sold your dogs
anÃ©l redfi'ced'fithe'fido'g'sÃ©'thatWESu fiw'ned'.!

495
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:57,275
The dogs that I have at home are mostly
mixed breeds that have been abandoned.

497
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,476
Selling them is out of the question.

498
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,645
There is nobody
who is willing to take them.

500
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,181
The only path left for them is.

501
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,184
To starve to death or be killed by drugs...

502
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,454
They only have one in two choices

503
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,823
Mr. Tsunashi'ma...

504
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,459
Mr. Tsunashima...

505
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:16,861
Here...

506
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:17,462
Huh?

507
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,531

How audacious can you get!\

563
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:29,493
I feel sorry for the dogs that are.owned by
someone who cannot handle them!

565
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,695
Come now...

566
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,130
after all, he did promise
that he'll make sure

568
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,731
the number of dogs
he owns won't increase...

570
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,733
Arthur and Christie were both great,
weren't they!

572
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,070
They were like police dogs

573
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,572
when they cornered Mr. Tsunashima
who tried to flee

575
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:41,772
It's instinct!

576
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:46,243
All I'Ah'th'fi'rA-did was go after the person
Who pushed his master,

578
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,480
and Christie is a sheep dog to begin with.

579
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,649
Shetland Sheep Dogs are brought up to
bring sheep

581
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,518
that have gone astray from the flock,

582
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,920
back into the flock...

583
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,158
They have the habit of going around

584
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,560
and stopping anything
that suddenly runs off!

586
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,230
Talk about a wet blanket!

587
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,766
I can t figure out why...

588
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:13,304
Ms. Hasuki's shoes were on the ground
near the incinerator...

590
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:17,541
He's the one responsible.

591
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,278
Hide here a while, will you...

592
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,213
What're you doing , Conan?

594
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,855
Hey!! Arthur'!

595
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,092
Since when did you start doing
a thing like that?!

597
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,028
Hey, Arthur Are you listening to me?!

598
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:37,395
C 07.7

599
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:39,897
Arthur

600
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,935
I wonder if he doesn't Ilke me anymore?

601
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,238
No he just wants you to stay here
forever,

603
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,873
right, Arthur!

604
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:53,411
Remember, you said a while ago
that Arthur would bring your shoes

606
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,447
when he thought you were going to
flake him for a walk?

608
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,616
That's why Arthur came to think

609
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:02,720
that humans cannot go outside
unless they wear shoes!

611
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,291
He tried to hide your shoes

612
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:11,095
so that you wouldn't be able to
go home with Christie who he really likes!

615
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,265
Is that right.

616
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:19,003
But, don't worry, Arthur...

617
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,439
Christie and I have also ended up

618
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,742
having to go to
London just like your master .

620
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:26,578
Huh?

621
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,512
WhiCh means...

622
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:30,647
Yes...

623
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,185
that is what I came to tell you today!

624
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:38,389
Which means that
you're going to get married after all?

626
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,625
This calls for a celebration.

627
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,660
Congratulations, both of you!!

628
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,396
Congratulations

629
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:48,366
We've got to have a celebratory party
before the move, then...

631
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,303
Silly d'og...

632
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,808
Don't worry,
nobody s angry at you anymore...

634
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,613
All right

635
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,750
We were all worried about you!

637
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,586
Because you looked to be
so blue recently .

639
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:12,156
That's why we were trying to think up
a plan to cheer you up!

641
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,291
So, I'm not counted in?

642
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:18,796
Because you're always arguing with Al.

643
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:19,764
LRight, right.

644
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,099
Oh, okay .

645
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,868
You did it, Arthur!

646
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:26,537
Good work!

647
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,015
Right, you should always keep smiling
Iike that...

649
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:37,515
Huh?

650
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,784
As long as you're wearing
that facial expression

652
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,953
you look nothing but a child.

653
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,259
You look far from an old lady
approaching her 90 s that way!

655
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,295
Nah, only joke!

656
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:51,896
How rude!

657
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:53,431
I'm only 84.

658
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,807
Why .Why

659
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,510
is he lying on the ground
in such an unnatural posnion?

661
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,512
Uh, take a good look.

662
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:11,516
The wine bottles on the very top of
the low shelf are toppled...

664
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:15,053
But, nothing's wrong with the wine bottles
on the shelves on this side!

666
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,256
I've found conclusive evidence

667
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,726
I'm sure the criminal still has it!

668
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,365
