Friendship. Romance. Mystery

Because we cherish them
we can continue

00:00:05,455 --> 00:00:07,239
Searching through
the cell phone memory

6
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,807
reveals an unusual case.

8
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,843
He sees through
the one and only truth,

10
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,544
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult

And

27
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,200
I found three prospective people!

29
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,136
They called from day
e ore yes erc: ay o \ 0c ay...

32
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,769
Three people?!

33
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:20,472
And? What did they have to say?

34
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,307
The first one...

36
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,876
said he wanted to go the interview
site of a company

38
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:27,980
but forgot the paper that he had
written the address on at home

40
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,848
and said that he may be

41
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,351
excluded from the interview
if they found out...

43
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,620
NF py WU
And asked to somehow
have them give him

46
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,387
the address...

47
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,755
The second call...

48
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,857
was from a man
who said his daughter

51
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,325
who had run away
from home had called

53
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,164
and that he wanted to specify from
where the phone call was placed...

55
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:46,915
The third-call...

56
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,417
was from a person who said
that the cell phone of a person

58
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,618
who he had befriended
during-his trip

60
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,804
was mistakenly mixed up.
In his bag

63
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:56,909
He wanted to thank that person
as well as return the cell phone

65
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,312
so he wanted the name and
address of that person...

68
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:01,947
He's the one!!

69
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:02,180
He's the one!!!

70
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,616
He's the only one
who mentioned cellphone so far!

72
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:05,851
Y-% FY)

73
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,319
On top of that,

74
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,856
only this last person asked to
ve the phone number too...

76
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:12,591
And. what's the number?!

77
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,194
Well...since they were going to
refuse answering him,

79
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,162
they didn't take his number down...

81
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,064
Besides all three

82
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,333
seem to have called from outside
and not their residence,

84
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,570
so they don't know
who called at all...

86
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:25,837
From outside?...

91
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,307
One called the day before yesterday

92
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,091
One called the day before yesterday

93
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:30,142
from the platform of Beika Station.

94
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,445
«the next one called yesterday
at noon from sports shop Aollo

96
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:36,615
and yesterday at sundown another
calledifrom Restaurant Colombo...

98
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,383
The problem is...

99
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:44,022
they don't remember
which person it was that asked

101
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,058
for the cell phone number...

103
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,094
Oh, right...

104
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,197
Tiseems that only the person
who asked for the phone number

106
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,633
suddenly hung the phone up
«from his side.

108
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:55,901
Suddenly?!

109
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:56,935
Yes...

110
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,072
They say they heard a sound on the
other side of the line at that time.

112
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,140
A sound that
interrupted conversation...

114
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,809
A loud sound...

115
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,579
it seems to have been
so-suddensthat they didn't seem to

117
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,549
have time to make out
what theasound of the was...

120
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,953
I guess we have no choice
but to get in touch with

122
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,457
the place that these three people

123
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,192
I've passed one of the universities

124
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,360
that I applied for although
it's not my-first.choice

126
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,395
Oh, I'm happy for you!!

127
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,596
Thanks...

128
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,598
I guess you're relieved.

129
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,833
Here's your change

130
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,003
Now, for the first one...

131
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:31,703
Yes...

133
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:37,459
ATION
What?!
The public phone on the platform?

136
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:37,709
ATION
What?!
The public phone on the platform?

139
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:37,960

00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,478
ATION
What?!
The public phone on the platform?

145
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,247
Tithe night before last...

146
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,917
There were many passengers using
the phone so...

148
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:47,636
Hmm-~~I.thought so

149
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:49,021
I mean I understand

150
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,024
Hey! Could it be-that guy?

151
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,924
Huh 2!

152
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,093
You know that person who was
standing in front of the phone

154
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,362
that looked to be contemplating
whether to call or not...

156
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,965
Oh=Come to think of it, yeah...

157
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,968
Uh She was wearing
this expensive looking coat.

00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,720
With a frightening and taut look...

160
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,472
He comes around to
the station recently...

162
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,975
Didn't you hear a loud sound

00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,399
mo ye
there was a man: with a short hair cut
that came here asking to

204
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,984
use the phone: He's the one, right?

205
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:12,003
He said that the battery of
his cell phone went dead...

207
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,939
and that he had no loose change either,
so he wanted to borrow the phone...

209
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,743
Huh? A loud noise?

210
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,343
Yes...

211
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,812
Was there noise loud enough back then

212
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,848
that you had to stop talking?

213
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,649
Yeah...I'm sure you're referring to

214
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,752
the sound of the construction...

215
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:30,088
that's been going on for about a week
in front of the bank...

217
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,591
See! It's started again!

218
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:32,958
Huh 2!

It's like this intermittently
from a little after noon time!

221
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:39,965
The sound of construction...

223
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:44,019

He's reticent and always wearing
Iight colored sunglasses...

229
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,780
He unusually seems/to
have forgotten his cell phone

231
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,448
and asked for loose change

232
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,350
in order to use the phone.

233
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,085

Did you hear that loud sound?
It's like this every noon and at sundown.

248
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,983
It'seems thatéthe campaign car usually
takes this route...

250
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,618
A political campaign car...

251
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,822
When will that customer
come to your shop again?

254
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,323

I'll give you a call.

All of them sure sound suspicious...

260
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,469
All of the three cases seem to ~~
fit the description.

262
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,404

00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:27,622
Maybe they all live in the
same neighborhood!

297
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,523
Stupid!

298
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:33,144
I just told you that there are no
10 digit numbers that start with 1.

300
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:37,666
I'm, pretty sure that the owner-of
this cell phone, that chubby man

302
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,151
are".
who got-to know: people
on the job or something,

306
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:40,552
whougot to know people
on the job or something,

308
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,821
putenumbers in order
besides their names...

310
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:43,772
Hey!

312
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,658
Among those numbers
which are the newest ones?

317
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,162
This is it.

318
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,817
1000. he sure knows a lot of people.

319
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,137
Yeah... maybe he was a door to door sales man

321
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:03,008
and just numbering his customers...

323
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,744
£5 ~-
007y
Then/what is thesnumber
behind it supposed to be?

327
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,346
C- Cw
2720
And this! What about this black dot?

331
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,850
Some are marked and some are not .

332
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,654
Maybe he marked the people

333
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,557
who are prospective buyers
with the black dot

335
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:23,028
The number towards the end like
150" and "600"

337
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,731
could be number of products he sold, or...

338
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,100
If so, that's strange?!

339
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:29,334
Huh

340
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,971
Because there are no people
before the numbers

342
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,340
1022 that are at the start of the
all the numbers, and see look carefully!

344
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,944
There are two people with
the number 1031"!!

346
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:39,544
Hmm» /

348
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:42,314
Two...

353
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,782
True.

355
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:48,119
And. this too!
There's a person numbered 1101

357
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,324
but why isn't thereranyone
with the numbers 1032 to 1100

360
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,427
If he was numbering everyone in order

361
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,029
why does the number jump suddenly
from 1031 to 1101

363
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,733
Uh...could it be that...

364
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,168
it's a calendar?

365
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:04,653
282425282728
IS ea Fon eu?

367
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:04,903
232425262728

369
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,504
Calendar?!

370
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,407
1031=0ctober 31st

371
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:13,378
1101=November 1st and so forth

372
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:14,496
I seell

373
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:17,165
Everything falls in place that wa 7 N

374
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,116
Hold it...

375
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,419
If this number stands for
the end of October last year

377
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,855
and this other one the 1st of November

379
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,957
it's just about the time
the Tohto Congress election was held

382
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,593
Besides...

383
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,364
back then it was a pretty busy time
with the community baseball tournament

385
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,733
and preparations for the autumn festival
and all...

387
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,702
SO, it's for sure that this guy's not
from this community

391
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,606
Hey! T That's:not the point...

392
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,408
I'm sorry.

393
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,476
No problem...

394
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,579
if the four digits at the top are dates

395
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:51,316
the numbers behind them could be
the time that he made the visit...

400
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:55,787
150" =1:50, "600" =6:00 sharp.

404
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,222
sly To
Then why

406
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:00,158
aresthe surnames written in kanji
and the names in katakana?

408
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,528
Because when he visits the house the
surname is written on the name plate, but

410
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:04,162
he can only get the name of the person
after he talks to them...?

414
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,330
he can only get the name of the person
after he talks to them...?

416
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,431
He can only get the name of the person
after he talks to them...?

418
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,432
1028000
he can only get the name of the person
fter he talks to them...?

421
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,166
RAY?
1028000
he can only get the name of the person
fter he talks to them...

425
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:12,137
It could be that the-person was
angry at the guy

427
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,306
for selling him something
he didn't want.

429
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:16,975
What?! Who?

430
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,510
Ow...the guy who called us
a number that was not displayed.

432
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:21,680
The one who. shouted for the owner of
the cell phone-to take the call.

434
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,915
And the same one who called
the telephone company asking

436
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,317
for the name and address of
the owner of the cell phone.

438
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,019
The man with the frightening face.

440
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,255
If we can find out who and where he is,

441
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,392
we can get the phone number of
this cell phone from him

443
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,829
and figure out the identity of
the chubby guy

445
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:44,135
Damn!! We wouldn't have to think
so hard if that guy didn't die

448
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,639
I wonder if that's how it really is?

449
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,206
Huh.

450
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,408
It's strange after all

451
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,976
The; place where that cell phone
was forgotten.

453
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:55,246
It's strange that it was folded in two,

454
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,981
with the antenna sticking out
and under the sofa

456
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,751
That's true, that it's strange.

457
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:03,121
It's, as if the cell phone was asking for
someone to find it.

459
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,090
Talking of the phone ringing,

460
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,926
[the gruff person who was the
2nd one to call said,

462
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,794
Didnit rim ?"

463
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,299
Maybe the chubby man made
the gruff man call

465
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,671
and was planning to secretly
give him the cell phone.

467
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,606
Don't be silly!

468
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,210
Then, why didn't he call the gruff man
over to this shop?

470
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,077
If ithe phone rings.

471
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:28,779
The employee of the shop
would find it first

473
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,648
and he could never give it away

474
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,950
secretly, could he?

475
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,120
Exactly! It's just as Pops says!

476
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,053
Right?!

477
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,389
He would never come back for something

478
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,024
he was planning to hand over secretly!

479
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,161
He couldn't have made mistake as
to the place either...

482
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,730
Mistake?!

483
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,666
You know,
Iike always make a mistake too.

485
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,001
Come to think of it,

486
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,469
before getting run over,

487
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,904
the chubby man asked for directions
at thexconvenience store...

489
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,139
Il see!

490
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,273
That's right...

491
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,042
If he wasn't familiar with this place

492
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,245
there's a possibility of
him making a mistake...

494
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,047
Then. the most suspicious would be...

495
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,716
Apollo!

496
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,085
He could've made a mistake

497
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,320
because this/shop Poirot
sounds similar to Apollo

499
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,421
the sports shop?!

500
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,422
I see!

501
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,627
But. Azusa. I think it's hard to believe
that he'd 'mistake a sports shop

503
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,928
for this coffee shop, don't you?

504
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,898
I...I-guess so...

505
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,966
Um. Azusa!

507
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,603
Why is the name of this shop
called Poirot?

509
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,640
Yup...l wonder if you know,

510
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,476
Hercule Poirot?
The master likes him,

513
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,577
that's where we got the name!

514
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,514
@Oonan, do you know Poirot?

515
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,516
The man's that a bit plump.

516
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,418
Yup! I've seen him on TV!

517
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,053
He's the one that always says,
You know, my wife she ."

519
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:45,590
The detective that's,
wearing the wrinkled up coat, right)

521
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:50,061
No! No!! He's not Poirot, but Colom...

522
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,045
bo...?

523
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:52,880
D.don't tell me!!!

524
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:56,301
Maybe he made a mistake because
they're both detectives?!

526
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:00,138
Besides, €olombo is located on
5-chome like we are

528
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:04,375
So, if that chubby man
remembered the shop

530
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,678
it's understandable that
he would make a mistake...

532
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,681
Let's go!!

533
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,049
Huh?! Where to?!

534
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,917
Where else?!

535
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,186
The-other detective's shop!!

536
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:16,638
Wait!

537
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,056
» Hey! I'm going too!!

538
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,340
Me 'tool!

539
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:23,294
The identity of the chubby man
is becoming.clear!

541
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,238
The man with the sunglasses that
I told you about over the-phone gg

543
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,656
hasn't.come yet

544
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,359
oh... could we wait for him here. then

545
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,494
Yeah.

546
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,031
Are you going to be all right, Azusa,
taking off from work like this?

548
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:43,948
Yes...

549
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,985
Master's there and as long as go back by
sundown when it'll start getting busy...

551
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,571
I'm so concerned that
I can't work this way anyway...

553
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:50,538
Hey. mister!

554
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:51,239
Huh

555
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,592
Did that customer ask you something?

556
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,627
Yeah...

557
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:59,030
From just a while age, each time
he comes here, he keeps asking me...

559
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,165
whether anybody found a forgotten
cell phone here...

561
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,635
ust as I thought...

562
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,471
There seems to be no doubt about it...

563
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,038
Right

564
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,009
Oh! There he is

565
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,343
Welcome!

567
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,479
it's him.

568
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:18,116
But...what did you want with him?

569
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,784
Oh . just a little something.

570
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,054
I'll go talk to him.

571
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,523
If I talk to him, I'm pretty sure I can tell

572
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,358
whether he's the person who called or not.

573
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,126
No!!

574
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:29,577
I'll go first!

575
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:30,328
Huh >1

576
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:33,064
In times like this. men should go first.

577
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:34,966
Nuaah!!

578
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,367
Haah! Haah!

579
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,201
Haaa

580
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:38,403
Huh 7!

581
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,204
What's the matter, Mr. Detective?

582
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,240
Aren't you going to go talk to him?

583
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,108
Talk to that man

584
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,978
after you hear my deduction out.

585
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,081
First for the strange names inskatakana

586
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,150
that were in this cell phone.

587
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:55,586
Although its made to look like
names of people at first glance,

589
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:58,523
these are actually,
the short form of a certain name...

591
00:15:58,991 --> 00:15:59,824
A certain name?

592
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,859
Please show me the cell phone.

593
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,795
Just what do you mean...?

594
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,664
There are names that are saved
on:the cell phone

596
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:09,634
that are very unnatural as
names of people, aren Athere?

598
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:14,288
Could you be referring to
Sho Kenbashi and Chiyo Daitoma?

600
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,473
True...

601
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:20,478
I've heard of places named like that,
but not so with the names of people.

603
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:21,379
Right!

604
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,282
Those names are probably
e names oO e groups

606
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,550
that belong to the name of-the place...

607
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:28,753
For example Sho Kenbashi stands
for Kenbashi Shopping Arcade

609
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,638
and Chiyo Daitoma stands
for Daitoma Community.

611
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,925
That it falls into place if so...

612
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,661
Ken Aida stands
for Aida Construction Company,

614
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,764
Seisaku Ishizawa stands
for Ishizawa Manufacturing Company.

616
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:40,631
Furthermore...

617
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:45,136
the 10 digit numbers that are registered
together with the names...

619
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,305
The 4 numbers at the top are dates.

620
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,107
The numbers after that denotes cash,

621
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,143
and the black dot shows that
the company in question is in the black.

623
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,945
In other words. it's about income.

624
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,849
The ones without the black dot means
just the opposite-That is. expense

626
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,685
If you consider that the dates are focused

627
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,987
during the election time of last year,

628
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:04,188
there is just one answer.

629
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,106
It can't be!

630
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:07,925
Under-the-counter accounting
book of election campaign funds?!

632
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:08,926
Exactly...

633
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,529
I have no idea how the chubby man got

634
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,265
a hold of the
under-counter accounting book, but...

636
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:19,170
there's probably no mistake that
he was extorting money for this...

638
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,274
(He probably put the copy of
the under-the-counter accounting 'book

640
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,577
into the cell phone to show
the one he was extorting

642
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,112
that he really had the info...

643
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,114
Which means that the man is...

644
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,315
Most probably...

645
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:33,885
some man hired by congressman Baisho,

646
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,654
who runs his election campaign
car through this area...

648
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:37,454
What?!

649
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,758
He probably wanted-«to get back the
under-the-counter accounting book...

651
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,829
That man hung up part way calling
he telephone company...

653
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,766
Because he heard the Shuhei Baisho's
election car coming...

655
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:52,253
He didn't want people to think that
anybody connected to Baishe was

657
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:54,739
searching for somebody
who had information

659
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,390
on the under-the-counter account book,

660
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:57,809
$0 he hung up without thinking.

661
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,845
The one who chose this shop as
the place to get the info,

663
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:04,115
IS that man wearing sunglasses,
who frequents this shop...

665
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,718
He was supposed to ring
the cell phone here

667
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,254
and secretly get hold of the information

668
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,390
but the chubby man made a mistake!

669
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,493
But, I wonder why the chubby man
didn't call our shop

671
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:19,530
after he realized he made a mistake?

672
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:20,998
Probably because...

673
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,067
He realized only after...

674
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,304
the time he promised to
ring the cell phone...

676
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,339
Because if it worked out the way
it should have,

678
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,742
the Chef of this'shop was supposed to
have found the cell phone

680
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,945
and the man wearing the sunglasses
was: supposed to come pick. it up

682
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:35,680
as something 'he-forgot.

683
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,748
Even if he went to the wrong shop,

684
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:41,552
if he calls the cell phone,
the guys could come pick it up at Poirot.

686
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:46,089
But he didn't want the guys
to hear his voice...

688
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:51,529
So. he probably carried everything out
using faxes and e-mails,

690
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,699
because he didn't want the guys to
get anything on him,

693
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,969
including his face and voice
that would identify him...

695
00:18:58,436 --> 00:19:01,939
That's why he even ended the contract
with the cell phone company

697
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,158
and peeled off the product number...

698
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:08,613
Then why did the chubby man
rush back to Poirot. .?

700
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,083
He wanted to confirm whether
the man wearing the sunglasses

702
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,152
really got hold of the cell phone.

703
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,155
Because if someone picked it up and
delivered it to the police,

705
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,656
his plans for getting cash
would go down the drain...

707
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:23,828
But, under these circumstances,
that man wearin the sun lasses

709
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,831
would probably refuse to talk no matter
what we ask him.

711
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,900
Don't worry, there's still a way.

712
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:29,567
Huh /!

713
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,935
Okay...Conan!!

714
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:31,652
Yup!!

715
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,637
Let's go, Azusa!!

716
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:34,105
Huh /!

717
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:35,740
Hurry!

718
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,541
C.Conan??!

719
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,127
Hey. Azusa!!

720
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:42,980
I wonder who forgot that cell phone?!

721
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,083
If the:owner can't be found,
give it to me, okay!!

723
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,720
This is the first time I've seen a
cell phone with such a strange pattern!

725
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,156
Huh? There are many strange names
and letters in it!!

727
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,458
Conan...

728
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:56,160
Hey you!! Kid!!

729
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:56,594
20...

730
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,462
Oh...I mean, sonny.

731
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,933
You see, that's my phone...

732
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,768
What?! Really?

733
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,836
Then, show me proof!

734
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:06,837
PP... Proof?!

735
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,210
Yup. if this is yours, you should know
the number of this cell phone, right?!

737
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,379
I'll call it with my cell phone and
see if it really works. I

739
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,481
Will you give me the cell phone number?!

740
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,416
Cut out the blabbering, hurry up and

741
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,752
Agh?! There's a policewoman!!

742
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,118
Huh 2!

743
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,656
I think I'll give this to that policewoman

744
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,559
H. Hold it...0 Okay...

745
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,761
I'll give you the number now...

746
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,799
I got hold of the chubby man's
phone number,

748
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,468
and from that number the police

749
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,438
tracked down the apartment
where the chubby man lived...

751
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:43,574
The man seems to have been
a journalist...

753
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,577
and a copy:of the
under-the-colintersaccount book

756
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,397
was found buried below
asheap-of receipts.

758
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,483
The names, dates and amount of cash
were clearly written in it...

760
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:56,254
and twas more than enough to
serve as evidence. {,

762
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,991
All the people who received meneyyyy
I= from or who were given money

764
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,810
from congressman Baisho during...
the election campaign

766
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:05,429
were arrested ..one after/the other...

Thank you so very much for yesterday.

If anything should ever come up again,
make sure you tell me, okay:.!

Yes, sir!

825
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,479
I cannot solve

826
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:03,481
Take for instance, thatTstudent...

827
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,050
He has successfully passed
the university exam,

829
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,985
and doesn't have to come here
to study anymore,

831
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,653
and yet he comes-here frequently...

832
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,256
I'm sure that something else is
blossoming inside him now...

834
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:14,558
?! A case!

835
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,596
Es! This is Detective...

Yup. what is it?

838
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:25,636
I think I'm going to be a bit late
because of club practice today,

840
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:26,971
so could you go shopping for me?

841
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,607
Yes...of course.

842
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,942
Uh potatoes...

843
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:36,814
Carrots. onions, pork. and apples!

844
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,884
Yep. I figure...

845
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,385
We're going to be having: cusry tonight?

846
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:42,553
Bull's eye!

847
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,038
