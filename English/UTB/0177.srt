00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:03,035
Just as flowing water has no form,

00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,871
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,606
deductions take all shapes and styles
in each and every case to be solved.

00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,741
Danger is closing in, Haibara and Conan.

Detective Conan comes to the scene.

13
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,982
On the way home from school,

14
00:01:56,717 --> 00:02:00,720
we run into the car of one of
the men in black, Gin's car.

16
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,357
+ I'set a transmitter and wire tap
up in the car and we pursue them!

18
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,160
However, Gin finds the gadgets.

19
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,896
He realizes that Haibara is around!!

20
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:17,336
We found out about Gin and
his men plan to kill somebody.

22
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,438
We head for a memorial
service of a movie director...

To be held at aido CityÂ¥Hotel.

25

What?!

27
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:31,617
What was that?

28
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:41,761

How is he, Detective Takagi?

52

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,101
He's the killer

57
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:00,573

Then you were the ones
closet to Nomiguchi

64
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,855
when the chandelier came falling?

65
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,825
Did you see anyone
suspicious at that time?

67
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,561
I didn't have time to be looking...

Take a look at this!

79
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,102
The chandelier skimmed
y my suit and it tore...

81
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,241
I see.

82
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,711
Inspector, she says she hasn't
seen anyone suspicious.

84
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,047
It's an accident, a mere accident!

97
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:52,258
But, somebody reported that there
was going to be a murder, right?

99
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,926
What about that?

113
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,503
After all ythat person
may be the murderer...

115
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:06,739
The person was using a voice changer

116
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,441
that we couldn't make out
whether it was a man or woman...

118

It could've been a prank then...

hi Mugikura (43)

127
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:16,549
Many people detested Nomiguchi
for being suspected of bribery so...

129
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,917
That's right,

130
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:22,153
and it just so happened that the accident
happened after the crank call

132
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,923
He was punished by the heavens!

I don't see how you can
at in this situation...

145
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,068
Phooey! I wish timid
greenhorns would shut up!

147
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,344
Hey, somebody go get the chef!!

148
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,447
What's the matter? Did you find
a cockroach in there or something?

150
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,983
That's because you ate a time like this

151
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,552
You're being punished
by the heavens too!

153
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,687
Come, now, let's all calm down...

154
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,957
T.This is...A piece of broken
chain from the chandelier?

156
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,192
Was it. found there...

157
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:04,129
Anyway. politician Nomiguchi
died because the chandelier

which came falling from

165
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,701
which came falling from
above crushed him, right?

167
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,603
If it were homicide,

168
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:14,840
then there would have:had
to be a rig of some kind.

170
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,776
And somebody would've had to
take him under the chandelier

172
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,079
after the place got dark

173
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:20,813
Hot...

174
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,882
there seems to be no such
rigs on the ceiling

176
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:28,787
that it was hanging from either...

177
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,856
Therefore dmurder'd be impossible!

178
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:35,594
Now that it's cleared.
May please be excused

180
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:41,567
That's true

181
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:45,903
Dropping the chandelier
on the target in the dark,

183
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,973
would've been impossible unless
something were to be set up beforehand

185
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,944
But, the killer succeeded in doing so. %.

187
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,953
Hey, where're we going

188
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,554
We're getting out of here.

189
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:06,692
It's too dangerous to spend
meaningless time here any. longer!

191
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,259
Besides...

192
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,561
If Inspector Megure and
the others see us here,

194
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,531
how are we going to
explain why we're here?

196
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,133
The.only clue there is,

197
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:17,136
is the broken off piece of chain
that you.picked: up a while ago.

199
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,607
You couldn't possibly figure out
who the killer is with just that...

201
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,709
What if I have two cluesy

202
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:29,214
After the'chandelier fell and
before the'lights came back on,

204
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,117
this handkerchief came falling...

205
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,119
So what?

206
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,323
The name of the killer
is not written on it is it?

208
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,025
See, look in the corner of
this handkerchief:the words,

210
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,762
Memorial Service for
Director Sakamaki" are sewn on

212
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,100
The owner of this handkerchief
received it here at the reception desk!

214
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,036
Besides: look*at everyone around you...

215
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,974
See, that man with the glass cup,
the plump lady next to him,

217
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,544
and the old man with
the beard who is beyond,

219
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,180
they all have handkerchieves...

220
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:02,748
The colors are different!!

221
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,149
What does that mean?

222
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:05,284
Probably...

223
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:09,555
because they passed out
handkerchieves of 7 different colors

225
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:13,192
in memonr of Director Sakamaki's
best movie, "Rainbow Handkerchief"

227
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:13,859
In other words,

228
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,163
if we check at the reception desk on
who received purple handkerchieves,

230
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,898
we have more or less a clue!

231
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:20,766
But...

232
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,737
we won't be able to determine whether
the owner'is involved with the killing.

234
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:25,971
Yeah...

235
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:30,943
still can't tell what it was used for or
whether it belongs to the killer or not...

237
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:35,547
But, the possibility that it has nothing
to do with the killing is not zero, right?

239
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,854
Excuse me, officer

240
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:42,388
Hmm?

241
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,490
May I go to the restr om?

242
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,023
Okay .. Â£

243
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,462
Hey, hold it, what're you all doing here?!

244
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,630
Is it true that politician
Nomiguchi passed away?!

246
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,601
I hear it was an accident...?
W about it?!

248
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,606
We'll explain everything later
so stand back everyone!!

250
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:01,807
Hey, wait!

251
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,275
Please answer us!!

Sherry

257
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,597
Huh? Who I gave the';
purple handkerchief to?

259
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:30,502
Ep! I picked that handkerchief up.
So I want to give it back to the owner!

261
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,440
That handkerchief was supposed to
be used for something later, right?

263
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,074
Yes, at the end of the gathering,

264
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,843
a certain color of handkerchief
was supposed be chosen,

266
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,945
and the people. with that
color of handkerchief

268
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,347
was supposed to make comments...

269
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,716
Can you give me the names!

270
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,186
I'll go look for the person who
doesn't have a handkerchief.

272
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,224
What shall we do, Inspector?

273
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,360
If we hold them back any longer,
e may cause a racket.

275
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,063
It looks like an.accident no matter
how you look at it too,

277
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,165
SO maybe:we should
Iet them go for now

279
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:00,899
Yes, sir...

280
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,034
I've found the person, sonny!

281
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,104
The ones's who are.in the room now,

282
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,507

I see, those seven...

285
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,380
I can't be absolutely sure...

286
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:20,519
but maybe one of their members
sco is among the seven...

288
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,753
Hey, they're.coming out!

289
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:27,259
Excuse me. were you nearby
when the accident occurred ?!

291
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,127
I don't 'know! :Get.out.of my'way!! *

292
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,230
Please tell us the-details of the accident.

293
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,231
Ask the police, not me!

294
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:37,635
Damn, let's go back to
Doc's car-for. now, H3ibara!

299
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,940
Hey, Haibara?!

300
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,775
Where are you? Answer met

301
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,211
gh, wait

302
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:47,713
Hey, where are you?!

303
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,315
Answer me!

304
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,819
Haibara

305
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:04,630
Al. Wake up, Al

307
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,306
What's thegqmatter?
We're having class now

309
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,147
Could it be because of your cold?

310
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,883
Maybe you should go rest
in the infirman after all...

312
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:25,951
A dream...

313
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,455
Ga . >
rLirgrie... rigger ase Co

315
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,259
It can't be coincidence that
I ran intothimvin town...

317
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,663
All my dreams are the sameirecently...

318
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,300
wonder if I'm tired.

319
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:42,734
Haibara...

320
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,370
Answer me, Haibara...

321
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,138
Who is it?

322
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,739
Hey,-Haibara?!

323
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:48,840
Who is it?!

324
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:49,942
Haibarar!

325
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,577
Who is it?!

326
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,476
Haibara??!

329
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,550
SS, Shinichi?

330
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,351
Haibara? Is it you, Haibara?!

331
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:01,452
Where are you?

332
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,956
In Doc's car in front of the hotel!

333
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,225
I'm using the microphone and
speaker that is built into my glasses

335
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,360
and communicating with you.

336
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,462
What happened...to me?

337
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,397
That's what I'd like to know!

338
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,766
What happened in the
corridor in front ofÂ¢the hall?!

340
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,002
I $front-of'the hall?...

341
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:25,344
Oh, I was swallowed by the crowd
of people .-VYand'lost track of you...

343
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,347
Somebody came at me from behind...

344
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,884
What from behind?

345
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,988
Somebody made me sniff' something

346
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,324
and I'm confined in a
wine cellar or something.

348
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,526
H Hey, somebody, don't tell 'me that...

349
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:46,498
S...The one who committed th
murder under the ven eyes of the police

351
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,401
is one of the members
of the organization...

353
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:50,969
Pisco!

354
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,337
What?!

355
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,741
Don't tell me he's near you?!

356
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,878
No, that somebody
is not here right now...

358
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,316
The door of this room is
securely locked.though .

360
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:10,322
The only thing that I see here are a box on
a baggage cart, and a janitor's overalls

362
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:11,890
Overalls?

363
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,394
Yes...after I was made
to sniff something,

365
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:19,464
he probably took me to the restroom
and changed into overalls,

367
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,834
then, he put me in this cardboard
box and brought me here...

369
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,772
I think that if he goofed killing
that politician in the hall,

371
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:31,109
he was going to carry out the killing
in the restroom and bring him here...

373
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:36,915
Okay, we've got to find a way to get you
out of there, and we've got to do it fast

375
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,986
Listen, Shinichi, listen very carefully...

376
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:47,592
The "Apo" in the Apotoxin
486 J3*thatishrunk my body

378
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,729
means. death of program

379
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:54,599
es...cells have a
self-destruction structure,

381
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:58,603
and is existing because of a
signal that keeps that in check...

383
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,672
hey AIAadl d

384
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,577
But, this drug not only guides apotosis,

385
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:07,979
it also waits for the
activation. of trimorphism

387
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,348
and increases multiplication efficiency...

388
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:15,487
Cut it out, Haibaral! I'll listen to all you
ave say after you get out of there...

390
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,889
Never mind, and just listen, williyou!!

391
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:24,096
Because I'm never going to be Â«
able...to...to talk to you again...}

393
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:24,963
What?

394
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,064
Can't you tell?

395
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:32,170
They kidnapped me
despite me being a child.

397
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:39,344
Even if were.to.able to get.out of here,
they would track medowniin'a day or two

399
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:45,650
If that happens. they will annihilate
Dr Agasa.who had sheltered me.

401
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:49,254
As well as everyone I am involved
with in order to protect their secret...

403
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,592
Now, do you understand?
Whether I am killed here

405
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,527
or whether I get out of here

406
00:14:56,162 --> 00:15:01,099
I will never be able
Oo see you all again...

408
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:02,868
Haibara...

409
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,940
That's why I'm going tojgive you all
the information on the drug while, I can.

411
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:14,279
Taraaah! "The Great Adventure
f Dr. Agasa Part II"

413
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,482
H,Hey, what was that...

414
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:22,287
Oh, the game that DrsAgasa made that
Mitsuhiko gavelback toime atsschool...

416
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,526
They probably checked the
MO that was in my pocket...

418
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,062
A cellular phone connected
to the computer means.

420
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:34,399
Just as I thought.

421
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,235
They were searching my face...

422
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,938
Hey, you're not tied up?

423
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,440
That's why I'm rushing! .

424
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:47,112
They wouldn't leave me for a long time
without even tieing me up, would they?

426
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,982
0...They won't be back for a while yet

427
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:51,716
Huh?

428
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,053
After you disappeared, I called
the: Inspectorimmediately...

430
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,957
And told him not to let the seven
who received the purple handkerchief

432
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,927
out of the Haido City Hotel

433
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,029
using Shinichi's voice!

434
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,464
The fact that you're not bonded,

435
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,835
and thatthe cellular is connected
to the computer goes to show

437
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,372
that the guy who confined you
wanted to leave the hotel...

439
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,441
just for a while for something,

440
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:20,111
but was stopped at the door by the
officers.and is being questioned now!

442
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,016
Moreover, it is ve: likely'that'he ;
made contact with those outside.

444
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:29,454
It's been an hour since
you disappeared, and yet,

446
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:34,459
it's unthinkable that nobody including
the guy who kidnapped you isn't back.

448
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,361
Just as I thought...

449
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,364
the guy who committed the
murder is among the seven

451
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,167
He assassinated his target
And confined you there

453
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,369
the guy called Pisco!!!

454
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,708
Then, you mean I'm still
inside Haido City Hotel?

456
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,276
Yeah, most probably!

457
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,445
If we can find proof that
he committed the murder

459
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:56,982
before he contacts the others,
and hand him over to the police,

461
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,085
you're still safe!

462
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:05,457
The longest the Inspector can keeps
them in the room is another hour...

464
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:11,496
I'll go ask the employee of the hotel if
they have a wine cellar that's not in use,

466
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,064
and get you out of there!

467
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,800
If I say . that argirlrisilocked.-in_ 27 _

468
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:16,935
You idiot...

469
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,139
Didnt I just tell you. what will:happen
to people who. get involvedywith:me?

471
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:27,445
It's not my fault.if something happens
to the enmiployee:who helps:me-out*

473
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,650
Then, why don't you find a way
to get out of there yourself!

475
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,754
In the mean time I'll go and figure
out which of the seven is Pisco...

477
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,391
You sayit.like it's "so simple,

478
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:44,796
but there is no escape route
here... 'only an old fireplace...

480
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,765
Can"you climb up that:fireplace?

481
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,637
Impossible...it's too wide to climb.

482
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,172
If I weren't this small,

483
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,608
I could probably use my hands and
Iegs and get out of here, but...

485
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,944
Isn't there.a rope or something?

486
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,814
I wonder...would they have
a rope in a wine cellar...?

488
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,718
Are there all kinds of liquor in there?

489
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,921
It seems that they pac
Iiquorifrom*all over the world.

491
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,089
Into this room that is not
being used anymore,

493
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,658
and turned it into
wine cellar...

495
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,493
Do you see something
called Paikal there

497
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,729
Paikal?

498
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,031
Yeah, it's a very strong Chinese liquor.

499
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,133
I don't know...

500
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,301
Look for it!

501
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,170
} wonder if ll can...

502
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,272
Why do you want me
to look for it, anyway...

504
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,841
How's! your cold?

505
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,410
Didn't you say:you were coming
down with one-this morning AN

507
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,313
What areiyou'a.scatter.brain...

508
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,549
Never mind, how are you feeling?

509
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:42,587
Thanks to being left lying on the floor
for a while, I think my fever went up.

512
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:43,454
1 HDTCo

513
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:46,624
You sound a bit happ

514
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:47,559
Sort of 4

515
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,730
I found, the Paikal...

516
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,966
But, what do I do with this liquor...?

517
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,335
I'm going to help you get out of there...

518
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,839
I'm going to put a real
ancy spe on you...

520
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,778
That was the scene.
Right after the accident?

522
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:07,178
MP rT

523
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,048
In-a-rogmjylocated near
the scene of the accident,

525
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,351
ittseems-that:several people have
been called in for questioning.

527
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:16,187
The names of these people
have not been announced...

529
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,156
This was brought to
you live from:the scene.

531
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,159
From the televised broadcast just now,

532
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,529
I've figured out the approximate positions
of the seven right after the murder.

534
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:26,865
But, this isn't enough...

535
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,301
Um ..what's the spelling
for Et Liqueur Poalo?

537
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:34,639
Hey. what're you doing?Did you
drinksthe Paikal like I told you to?

539
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,808
VesBidid.

540
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,213
I don't know what you're trying to do,
but Imsfeeling as worse as ever...

542
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,350
Give me the spelling for Poalo...

543
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:52,557
it's H-e-r-c-u-l-e P-0-i-r-o-t,
why do you want know

545
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:58,630
I'm trying to download the data
of that drug to Dr.,Agasa's MO,

547
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,632
but it requires a password.

548
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,104
No good...l can't open
with Poirot either...

550
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:09,074
What do you mean
the password is Poirot?

552
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:14,846
People of the organization
used to call this drug in its trial.

554
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:22,854
Serial number 4869 was coded
Sherlock... for inefficient detective...

556
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,690
That's why I'm entering the
names of all the detectives...

558
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,459
I can think of one after the other...

559
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,929
I, guess its not all that easy

560
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,130
Shelling Ford...

561
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:32,497
Huh?

562
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:37,902
It's spelled. S-h-e-l-l-i-n-g F-0-r-d...

563
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,204
Was there'a detective by that name?

564
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,473
Never mindNjust enter it!

565
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:46,077
L-L-I-N-G-F-O-R-D...

566
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,684
Mt opened... why?

567
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,519
The name Shelling Ford,

568
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,789
is the temporary name that Conan Doyle
named the detective of his novel,

570
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:01,291
before the detective
was renamed Sherlock.

572
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:04,695
In other words, this detective
was in his trial stage!

574
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:08,500
Oh...itys a pretty fancy thing
for the organization to do

576
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,768
We.don't have much time left...

577
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,505
How're you doing?

578
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,875
Of course hm doing terrible,
rinking that liquor...

580
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:23,147
I'm going to download the data of the
drug into the MO, and hide it here,

582
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:29,254
so come get later, okay...
After they come to get me...

584
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:30,522
H Hey.

585
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:32,857
S Shinichi, in front of you...

586
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,599
It sithem:-- Don't tell me
they've .come'for Pisco...

588
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,268
No, no-way!

589
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:47,939
Before the seven people are released,
the Inspector is 'supposed 'to call'me'...

591
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:54,312
Don't tell me that a transmitter was built
in to the computer that Ai was using...

593
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:59,617
I see, since they couldn't get through
by phone, they followed the transmitter...

595
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,452
Ail, big trouble!

596
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,454
They're coming! Hide in the
fireplace or something for now...

598
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:07,625
Hey, what's up?!

599
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,665

600
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,537
