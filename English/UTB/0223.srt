The strange letter sent to
Heiji Hattori beckons us and

20
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,822
we come to the island of Bikuni

The Island of Bikuni

23
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,763
but we learn that the sender,
Saori Kadowaki, is missing.

25
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,836
That night, the island is lively

26
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,638
because they are celebrating
the annual Dugong Festival.

28
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:23,142
The islanders believe that whoever
possesses the dugong arrows blessed

30
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,412
by the Holy Person who gained
eternal life by eating dugong meat

32
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:29,248
would also be granted eternal life.

33
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,619
But during the festival,

34
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:37,289
one of Saori's childhood friends,
Toshimi Ebihara

36
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,360
is found hanging
by the neck in the waterfall.

38
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:47,833
Heiji and I realize this is a murder and
we begin to investigate,

40
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:52,304
but on the night of Toshimi's wake,
another murder takes place

The footprints on the sand are
from sandals & rubber boots...

00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,375
Naoko was probably wearing
these sandals,

83
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,376
so the murderer must've been
wearing boots!

85
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,546
How cruel...

00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,680
Hey, look!

87
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,784
See, doesn't this look like an arrow was
stepped on by sandals?

00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,187
It's been stepped on by sandals

90
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,556
so Naoko must have stepped on it
after it fell

92
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,491
while she struggled with the murderer...

93
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,027
The killer must've taken the arrow!

94
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:54,467
Let's follow the boot prints,
that'll lead us to the killer.

96
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,568
You're right...

97
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,337
Hey, these prints...

00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,841
They look like they go straight
into the ocean...

You're right...

101
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,544
Huh?

102
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,581
There's some shiny things
around the prints...

104
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,883
What are they?

105
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,653
Hmm... these are . '7?

106
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,856
Fish...scales...?

107
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:21,360
There're 2 or 3 fish scales
on Naoko's body too.

109
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:22,728
What?

110
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,063
Hey!!

111
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:24,663
Huh?

112
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,533
What are you people doing there...!

113
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,935
Carrying out an investigation, of course...

114
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,304
We're the Fukui Prefecture Police,
that's OUR job!

116
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,939
Prefecture Police?

117
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,175
You're finally here...

118
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,477
What?!

119
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,480
The killer's footprints disappeared
into the sea?!

121
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:44,717
Yeah...and left some fish
scales behind too

123
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,719
Did you say fish scales...!?

124
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,687
You're no saying the killer's"...
A mermaid... 1?

126
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,622
How stupid!

127
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:52,057
Mermaids don't wear rubber boots!

128
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,628
The killer probably approached
from the shoreline and

130
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,330
then went up to the nets where
Naoko was told to wait...

132
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,667
after murdering Naoko,
the killer walked back to the shoreline

134
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,004
and left the scene walking
through the water!

136
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,372
Now I get it...

137
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:11,210
By the way,
did anyone see Naoko leave the room?

139
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:15,314
Not me...
she wasn't there when I got there...

00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,219
You signed in right after Naoko,
didn't you?

146
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:23,722
I didn't see her and nobody was in
the room when I got there...

148
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,326
That means Naoko was the first one
to get here

150
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,763
then she left to go to where
the nets were hung...

152
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,231
Wait a minute,

153
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,301
do you think the same person
who killed Toshimi killed Naoko too?

155
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,870
We don't know that for sure yet

156
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,307
but we do know the killer
took Naoko's arrow...

158
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,709

Saori also said that she'd lost her arrow,

do you think...

163
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,850
Yeah...she might already be dead too...

164
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:58,624
I saw Saori near the Mermaid's waterfall
on the morning of yesterday's festival.

169
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,860
I saw her too.

170
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,297
She was far away and I only caught a glance,
she was in the forest by the waterfall...

172
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,933
Are you absolutely sure it was Saori?

173
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:12,037
No mistake, she was the only girl
with brown hair and glasses...

175
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,173
And she always wears blue clothes...

176
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,307
Then she must be running
away from something,

away from something,

189
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:34,426
I just hope she hasn'tsturned into
a mermaid like this dead girl...

191
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,296
Mermaid? What do you mean?

192
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,430
Didn't you know?

193
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:44,169
The legendary nun ate the meat of
the mermaid that was caught in the net...

195
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,105

198
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,713
women will return to the water and
become silent mermaids...

Hei...

206
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,138
Later that night, the police searched
everyone at the wake looking

208
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,841
for the person who took Naoko's arrow,

209
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:29,114
the only ones with arrows were Benzo
and Kazuha, who won them at the festival.

211
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,051
Hey Kudo, did you find anything out?

212
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,419
No, nothing...

213
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,254
All I know at this point is,

214
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:39,625
Toshimi, Naoko & the missing Saori

215
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:46,932
the powers of the Holy Person who
is said to have eaten mermaid flesh...

217
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,668
Yeah...it's almost abnormal
how much they believed in it...

219
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:54,807
If we only knew who held what number
at last night's fest:

221
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,342
that's easy.

223
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,978
We have everyone sign the list...

224
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,182
Would you like to come with me now
and take a look at the lis

226
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,650
Of course!

For goodness' sake Dad!
Get a grip on yourself!

00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,930
I know this is a bad time,

230
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,532
but... did you think about
what we talked about before?

232
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,134
I'm serious, you know...

233
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:23,135
I can't...

238
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,243
I can't leave this island...

239
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,278
I'm sorry...

240
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,152
Did the 5 of you go to
college together too?

242
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,086
Yes...

243
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:45,491
We all loved watching movies &
joined the movie club in college

245
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,194
We even made a film about
the legendary n

247
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:54,099
And it took first place in the film contest,
we were all so

249
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,969
We set our sights on Hollywood!

250
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,237
That's fantastic!

251
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:03,442
But we all loved this island and
ended up coming back...

253
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,745
who would have dreamed Toshimi &
Naoko would end up like this...

255
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,986
I could have sworn we left them here...

256
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:15,654
Can't you find them?

257
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,790
No...only the ones for this year
are mis

259
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,126
Maybe that old lady took them?

260
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,661
She would never do that...

261
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,497
Did anyone else know
you kept them there?

263
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,100
Most of the locals knew

264
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:32,337
I'll go check the other rooms just in case.

265
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:35,274
I'll help you.

266
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:36,842
Me too...

267
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,110
Thank you.

268
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,585
Wow, look at these names!

269
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,987
A former Foreign Affairs Minister,
a Chief Secretary of-the Cabinet and

271
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:50,088
a President of the Bank of Japan!

272
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,825
They all wanted to live
a long life I guess...

274
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,194
Shino Miyano...?

275
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:56,862
I'm pretty sure...

276
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,865
her real name was something like that...

277
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,303
but it couldn't be...she's not the type to
wish for eternal youth & beauty...

279
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,105
Eceececeeceececeek!!

280
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:10,909
What happened!?

281
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,646
I saw a brown haired girl with
glasses standing?Oover there...

283
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,548
She was staring at us!

284
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:18,183
Th, that's impossible...!

285
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,183
Th, that's impossible...!

286
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,586
Saori was here...!?

287
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,921
Huh? What is this...

288
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,356
Why is this glass cracked!?

289
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,391
Where's Kimie!?

290
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,627
She said she was going to look in
the rebuilt warehouse.

292
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,362
Where is it!?

293
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:31,663
I'm pretty
she said it was behind the shrine.

295
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,499
She said it was behind the shrine.

296
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,967
Hey, what's that?

297
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,435
It's awfully bright over there!!

298
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:37,803
It couldn't be!!

299
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:41,673
The fire continued to burn
throughout the night

301
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,343
just like it did 3 years ago,
it burnt to the ground...

303
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,880
that's right...

304
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,215
it was exactly like the fire 3 years ago...

305
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,051
including the remains of 1 victim...

306
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:55,587
A burned body!?

307
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,823
It was burned beyond recognition

308
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,091
but it had glasses on it.

309
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,994
You could just barely make out
that it was wearing blue clothing.

311
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,430
It's probably... Saori...
who was missing...

313
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,166
Th, then the girl we saw last night...

314
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,768
Was a gh, ghost

315
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:11,737
Kimie...where are you, Kimie...
Mikoto Shimabukuro (130)

317
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:15,106
Kimie...where are you, Kimie...
Mikoto Shimabukuro (130)
LR 553 (130)
BOWIE

321
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:15,374
Mikoto Shimabukuro (130)
B&R IRE 30
HORNE

324
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:15,574
Mikoto Shimabukuro (130)

325
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:16,475
Kimie...

326
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,177
Isn't Kimie back yet?

327
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,178
No, she's not .

328
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,714
I'll go stay with the great grandmother...

329
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,049
I'll go too...

330
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,919
Hey Hattori...

331
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,521
didn't Kim.
She went to the dentist recently?

334
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:30,689
Yeah, she did...

335
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,358
You don't mean...

336
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,260
do you know what you're implying...

337
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:36,827
Don't fool me...

338
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,598
the same thought passed through
your mind too, didn't

340
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,134
We bot
the same bad feeling about this...

342
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:47,539
Yes, I see...thank you very much...

344
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,743
What did you find out...1?

345
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:57,115
They compared Kimie's dental records
with the burn victim's teeth and...

347
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,851
They were a perfect match

348
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:01,987
How awful...

349
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,288
Kimie's dead...

350
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:07,693
She... can't be...

351
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:08,860
I don't believe it!

352
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,462
It's all a lie!!!

353
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:18,803
I see...

354
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:20,973
So Kimie's dead...

355
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,108
We're very sorry...

356
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,344
we lost sight of he
for just a few moments...

358
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,614
Another young life has been lost...

359
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,351
and here.l am, still alive at this old age,
I'm-so a

361
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:33,385
I have a question,

362
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,987
the mermaid's grave that
you asked someone

364
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,154
to help you move into the forest...

365
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,856
who helped you do it?

366
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,326
It won-t do you any good to know...

367
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,730
that person's died before me too...

368
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,735
Hey, Mr. Mouri!

369
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,504
Did you find anything?

370
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,005
Absolutely nothing!

371
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,441
What a complicated case...

372
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,710
we can't even figure out who the killer is,

373
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,479
how can we find a motive for all of this...

374
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:06,485
On top of that, we don't even know
why Kimie was dressed like Saori...

376
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:11,390
Well, that was probably to make us think
it was Saori who die

378
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,058
Then the Killer must be Sao...

379
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,295
Or it could be someone who
wants us to think it is.

381
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:18,296
Huh?

382
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,098
Is that the ocean?

383
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:24,002
The ocean's right behind us last night...

384
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:32,811
Kimie told us that . last night...

385
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,981
Well, no matter who the killer is,
one thing is for sure

387
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,085
we've got to find the killer
as soon as possible,

389
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:44,289
we can't let such a heartless
Killer run f

391
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,260
Dad!

392
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,295
What is it, Ran?

393
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,166
Someone just called Kimie's home,
the caller said something strange!

395
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:55,332
What do you mean?

396
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,103
The caller said, Thank you for
Ietting me have the arrow.

398
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:02,307
It was worth the 1,000,000 yen,
my son's operation was a success'.

400
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,176
Someone bought the arrow!?

401
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,377
For 1.000.000 yen!?

403
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,611
ICC...

404
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,713
the caller said that the other morning,

405
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:11,750
a man who said he worked at the shrine
agreed to sell it as a special favor...

407
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,587
Doesn't that have something
to do with the old couple

409
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,456
who cancelled the morning of the festival?

410
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,490
It probably does...

411
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,459
And so what was the man's name?

412
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,060
I don't know but

413
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:25,464
he was a big man probably in
his 50's and he had a scruffy beard...

415
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,164
Are you sure...!?

416
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:27,866
Benzo!

417
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:32,404
Hey! If it was before the festival,
then that arr

419
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,341
More than likely it was the arrow
Saori said she lo

421
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,679
And luc {for Benzo, he won an arrow
at the festival and on top of that,

423
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,215
the register with all the names got lost...

424
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,916
Something's going on...

425
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,186
Naoko, who was kille
on the day of Toshimi's wake, also

427
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,888
had her arrow stolen...

428
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,225
I'm going to the Ebihara's home
where the wake was held.

430
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,696
Kudo, I mean... Mr Mouri, please
go and check Benzo's place!

432
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,397
Good grief...

433
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,503
Are you sure about that!?

434
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,974
Did you say Benzo left right
after us last night!.

436
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,910
That's right, he looked scared...

437
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,713
I knew it, Benzo was listening to us...

438
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,850
He heard us talking about going
with Kimie to check the register...

440
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,654
So he took a short cut and stole it
before we ar

442
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:26,024
Then it was probably Benzo who set fire
to the warehouse,

444
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,092
You re probably right...

445
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:31,296
if Kimie found him hanging around
holding the regist

447
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,831
What are you doing here?

448
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,166
Don't tell me you forgot!

449
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,668
You're the one who told me to stay close!

450
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,370
Oh... that's right...

451
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,439
Besides, since I have an arrow
that's been bless

453
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:42,941
I'm your good luck charm!

454
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,779
You have nothing to worry about,
if you're in danger, I'll protect you!!

456
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,614
Wow, I'm so lucky...

457
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,851
I'm serious...Heij...

458
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,188
But now that Kimie's dead,

459
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,557
I guess this will b
the last Dugong Festival...

461
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,425
I guess so...

462
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,628
Hey, you!

463
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:08,767
Can you tell me again which footprints
are yours and which are your friends?

465
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,169
Sure no problem...oops!

466
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,007
Huh? What the

467
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,376
What is it, Heij1?

468
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,316
There are scratches on the back
of this sandal and they're still fresh.

470
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,720
Where are the sandals
Naoko was wearing?

472
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,122
They were taken
the Fukui Police Department.

474
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,725
Kazuha, let me see<your arrow

475
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,527
Eh? Sure...

476
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:40,932
Perfect match...

477
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:44,436
These are the sandals that stepped on
the arrow on the sa

479
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:48,240
which means...
what I thought all along...

482
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,379
I knew it, no one's home!

483
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,848
Hey, what're you people doing here?

484
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,618
Well, uh, we wanted to talk to Benzo,

485
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,553
do you know where he is?

486
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,723
I haven't seen hi
since the wake last night...

488
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,291
What bad timing...

489
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:09,761
we thought at least we could take
a look at the missing Saori's room...

491
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,231
If you want to get insid
take a look underfthe potted plant

493
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,634
That's where the key is

494
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,802
Let's see now...

495
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:19,871
Aha, I found it...!

496
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,274
Alright, let's do it!

497
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,776
Are you sure it's alright to
go in without permission?

499
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,845
He won't mind, we'll just have a fast look!

500
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:30,649
Hey, how did Saori act
just before she disappeared?

502
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,586
She was s
even when the ocean got rough...

504
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:36,387
she said the mermaid
was going to punish her...

506
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,689
Punish her...?

507
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:42,961
This is SaOri's room.

508
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:43,828
Hmmm...

509
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:45,964
Huh?

510
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,733
What's this bag doing here?

511
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,070
I wonder what's inside

512
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,271
Co, Conan...!

513
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,074
Aspirin, toothbrush...

514
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,343
That's Saor
run away from home set...

516
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,512
But then she usually went to Kimie's

517
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:05,050
so I heard she kept extra clothes
and a spare pair of glasses there...

519
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,519
So you m
the clothes Kimie was wearing

521
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,853
when she was found in the warehouse,

522
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,655
she could have put them on herself?

523
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,458
Why'd she have to go and do that for...

524
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,794
Maybe to lure the killer out...

525
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,197
Just kidding!

526
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,766
Ha, ha ha...that's ridiculous...

527
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:26,570
But if Kimie thoug
the killer was after Saori too

529
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,208
and if she saw someone suspicious
hanging around the house

531
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,310
she might have done what Conan said
so that she could catch the Killer...

533
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,879
You're crazy,

534
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:36,681
Iast night during the fire,

535
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:40,018
didn't you say you saw someone who
Iooked like Saori in the yard

537
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,355
Is there a picture of Saori in this room?

538
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:45,790
I think there's a photo album around...

539
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,128
Hey Ran! Is this the girl you saw?

540
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,464
I'm not sure, it was pretty dark...

541
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,100
These pictures,

542
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,870
are they ones from w
you did the film on the legendary nun?

544
00:18:59,005 --> 00:18:59,671
Yes...

545
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,106
Where? Let me see...

546
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,842
Wow, this is something!

547
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,213
It really looks like a mermaid
IS swimming in the ocean...

549
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:12,217
It really does! This scene
In the storm is so realistic...

551
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:17,122
Yes, Saori's special effect photography
and Kimie's theatrical makeup techniques

553
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,124
were the main reasons
we won first place...

555
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:22,794
but 1 year after that,
there really was a storm

557
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:27,799
and both of Kimie's parents, as well as
mine and Saori's mother were lost at sea.

559
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,235
Not one of us dreamed anything
Iike that would happen.

561
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,604
Huh? Wait a minute...

564
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,942
bank book, cash card, name stamp...

565
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,211
driver's license and passport are here...

566
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,815
But that thing's not here...
I don't understand

568
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,851
It cant be...1?

569
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,993
Hattori here...

570
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,765
Oh, Kudo, it's you...
oh, I mean Mr. Mouri?

572
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,801
I was just about to call you!

573
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,271
The sandal we found in
the Kadowaki's yard

575
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,440
had scratches on it
from stepping on the arrow!

577
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,176
It proves that.on the night of the wake,

578
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,211
the killer went to whe
Naoko was waiting near the nets

580
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,915
and after killing her,
the killer returned to the wake!

582
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:23,021
The only 2 who could have done
that were Benzo and Rokuro...

584
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,889
But seeing how upset Rokuro
was in the afternoo

586
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,526
I doubt he'd do anything to hurt Kimie...

587
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,663
Which means...

588
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,633
I'm going to tell you my theory now...

589
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,668
Iisten carefully...

591
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,837
Yeah sure, go ahead...

592
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,887
That's ridiculous! It's impossible!!

593
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,323
I don't believe it!!

594
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:00,191
Hattori...

595
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,227
when we rule out the impossible,

596
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:08,366
only the truth remains, no matter
how unbelievable it might seem!!

598
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,201
What did you say!?

599
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:10,935
Inspector!

600
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:14,906
Our men are in the forest
tracking down Benzo Kadowaki!

602
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,608
Good! Let's go men!

603
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,078
After we catch Benzo,
I'll go to where you are!

605
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,179
Wait for me there!

606
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,855
I don't want to believe it either, Hattorl...

607
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,525
It's a lie! A lie! It can't be true!

608
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,260
You canst make me believe it, Kudo!!

609
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:37,896
What's that?

610
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,998
Do you smell incense?

611
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,366
You're crazy!

612
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,635
Who'd be burning incense
this deep in the forest. huh?

615
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,150
Is this the mermaid"s grave...?

616
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,220
W, wait a minute...
then this must mean...

618
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:08,927
Kudo must've been right...

620
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,797
Oh no!

621
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,332
Oh no! The cliff...!

622
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,868
Argh!

623
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,214
