Oh, boy, don't you get tired of watching

24
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,595
the same video over and over
again during the day?

26
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,197
That's enough!

27
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,932
Oh, no!

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,533
Why not!

29
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:15,935
I have so little work to do anyway...

30
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:21,073
But you have a lot of mail!
It may be a job offer.

32
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,908
I will look through them later,

33
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,275

somewhere around, 0.K.?

This letter is from Yoko!

42
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:42,828
What!

43
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,333
It's an invitation to a party!

44
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,701
Great!

45
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,037
An engagement party
will be held at her friend's house!

47
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,805
How wonderful!

49
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,875
Engage, engagement?

50
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,683

51
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,187
asked her to arrange to meet
the renowned Detective Mr. Mouwuri...

You re, right!

81
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,561
YOU were the one who was sadly
mistaken and terribly disappointed!

83
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,696
So? Who is she?

84
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,065
Your engaged friend?

85
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,667
You will see her soon

00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,802
All of you know her very well!

87
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,037
Do I know the person well?

88
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,205
Hi, Yoko!

89
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,140
H, dear...

90
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,609
You really brought him here...

The renowned Detective...Kogoro Mourli

92
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,949
You...l guess,

00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,587
you are cast as the Detective, Samoniu...

00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:21,826
So, then,

102
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:24,430
you're Yoko's engaged friend?

103
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,366
Well, actually, no...
I am her future husband-to be.

105
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:31,302
Yoko's best friend is my future bride...

106
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,706
Anyway, I think it's really
great that you brought

108
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,207
the renowned Detective, Mourn, to us.

109
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,643
She'll sure be delighted to meet him!

110
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,747
In fact, she doesn't know
that Mr Mouri is here yet...

112
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:43,849
I wanted to surprise her.

113
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:48,153
OK, let's go to see her surprised look...

114
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,894
There's no answer at all...

115
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,331
But, everyone should
already be here by now...

117
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:01,901
Gosh!

118
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,136
The door ls unlocked...

120
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,073
Nuts!!

121
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,716
I'm really sorry, Mr. Mouri...

122
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:21,120
How embarrassing...And you
e all the way out here...I.

124
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,487
h... Don't worry about it

125
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,857
Being struck by a famous
actress like you... will be

127
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,792
something special to look back on...

128
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,495
I'm recently being hassled by a stalker...

Kaoru Kusano (Actress)

135
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:33,399
I saw a strange man looking through
the peep hole of the door,

137
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,733
so I couldn't help striking at you...

138
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,102
If you are his admirer or fan, you
should have known his face?

140
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:37,970
I can't believe it...

141
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:42,107
Well then, Yoko's friend
who got engaged to Mr. Kenzaki is...

144
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,047
The formal wedding ceremony
will be this coming spring!

146
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,683
It's still off-the-records to the media...

147
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:56,121
Oh, that reminds me, Kaoru co-starred
with Mr. Kenzaki in Detective, Samonji.

149
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,224
That's right!

150
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,560
We brought them both here to
celebrate and tease them,

152
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,296

Gee... Your nails, I think, are
a little bit too flashy, Yuku...

166
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,443
Cool, huh? These false nails...

167
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,913
Ah, but it's a pity...

One more person,
and all four would be present.

173
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,156
How regrettable indeed...

174
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,225
Oh, did someone call me?

175
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,396
TERUMI!!!

176
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,066

189
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,141
Come, come...

190
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:53,579
Now the four Earth Ladies have
gathered here again after a long recess.

192
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:55,180
Earth Ladies?

193
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,950
U may not know, but...

194
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,453
Kaoru for the fragrant
field of sweet grass!

196
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,790
Yuki Takeno is for white snow
covering the high mountain!

198
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:10,296
Terumi Hoshino is for the
glittering stars in heaven!

200
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:14,633
And Yoko Okino is for the sparkling
waves of the blue sea!

202
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,905
So, all four of them together
are called Earth Ladies'!

204
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,373
That's figures...

205
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,311
Each of thenames stands for
a superb view of the earth...

207
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:30,282
Yeah, but Earth Ladies broke up because
of a quarrel between Terumi and Kaoru...

209
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,752
So, only Yoko continued on as a singer.

210
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,255
Anyway, I was surprised that...

211
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:40,059
Kaoru, the youngest of the four of us,
turned out to be the first to get married.

213
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:41,860
Actually, so did I!

214
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,930
I thought Terumi would be the first
to get married and settle down!

216
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,134
Hey, I thought you once said
something about your loved one?

218
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,870
Yes, yes, tell us what happened to your
relationship with the guy?

220
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:52,738
Did you confess your love to him?

221
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,308
Not really.

222
00:07:57,077 --> 00:08:00,412
Besides, it's much easier to
Iove him from a distance.

224
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:04,383
That way I can keep him in my
heart as my ideal man.

226
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,785
You know , like some people say,
Marriage is the tomb of love and trust.

228
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,887
Hey, just what do you mean by that?

229
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,489
Terumi! How dare you...

230
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:16,261
but who is that old man with the kid?

231
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,531
Oh, yeah...Are you
Kenzaki's brother or something?

233
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,205
It's about time
Detective SAMONJI will be starting.

In the meantime,
I'm going to take a bath.

247
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:34,713
Just tell me when.it's over.

248
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:36,515
But...umm...

249
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,517
As the food's getting cold,

250
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,152
I'd like to have dinner together now...

251
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,420
Please don't bug me!

252
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,988
I said PASS! Don't make me say
the same thing over and over again!

254
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,058
When will you get off telling me
what to do? Huh, a loser like you!!

256
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,594
I'm sorry

257
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,796
Wait! Kaoru

258
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,332
She hast changed at all...

259
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,435
She's always embarrassed
to watch the programs she stars on,

261
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,303
with other people...

262
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:00,906
Just as we planned...

263
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:02,508
Hey!

264
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:03,842
Are you really going to do it?

265
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,879
Of course! That's why we invited you!

266
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,514
Do what?

267
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,450
We'll be waiting for you
in the living room...

269
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,986
Yoko, why don't you go first, and change
Into your costume in the restroom?

272
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,099
That's none other than the costume that

273
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,234
the Earth Ladies
wore at the time they debuted!

276
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,669
I SCC.

277
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,205
When Kaoru comes
out of the bathroom...

279
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,573
Yep!

280
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,576
Three of us are going to
celebrate her engagement by \

282
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,711
wearing these costumes and
singing our debut song...

284
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:43,849
It's so embarrassing
to wear this costume, though...

286
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,484
Oh! Great!

287
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,486
It looks nice! Lovely Yoko! WOW!

288
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,055
You're just too much! You know that?

289
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,127
Thank you for waiting!!

290
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:56,495
Tah-Dah!

291
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:57,396
Ugh!

292
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,665
Do you really wanna do it?

293
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,335
Well then, next I'll go get rejuvenated!

294
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,938
Hey, Yuki. Hurry up.
I also have to change into...

296
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,745
Hey, let's all write a few lines each...
in celebration of Kaoruissengagement.

298
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,617
I wish you much love and happiness...

300
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:19,784
OK...

301
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:22,921
Here you go!

302
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,590
OK then, next, Terumi...

303
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,426
Don't mind me, I think I'll pass...

304
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,829
It's a good opportunity to make
peace with Kaoru, I think.

306
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,766
OK, OK. I'll write something...

307
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:36,435
Hey...

308
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,473
Did Kaoru really want to see Pops?

309
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,976
Yeah, as she said,

310
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,178
weirdo follows her around...

311
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,282
She wants him to
find out who the man is...

313
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,288
Once she moves in with me, she won't
be troubled by the man anymore?

315
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,556
Yeah!

316
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,529
Oh that's a message card?

317
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,866
Yeah, we're all
writing our comments on the card.

319
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,502
All right, then
I'll go get transform myself...

321
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,573
Look! What is this?

322
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:14,940
I express-my 'condolences.
Terumi Hoshino

324
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,207
I express:my,; condolences.
Terumi Hoshino

326
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,377
I express my condolences.
And she stubs out her cigarette on it...
I express my;condolences.
Terumi Hoshino

330
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:18,577
I express my condolences
and she stubs out her cigarette on it...

332
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,077
ust what Terumi would do...

333
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,117
If Terumi dares to do that,
hen I can do this...

335
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,355
With a loving kiss!!

336
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,493
Hey! Manager,
why don't you write something to her?

338
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:35,961
No, um, I...

339
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,367
C'mon You donst have to be modest...

340
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,903
Well, now, you can write anything,
comments, complaints,

342
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,404
whatever you like.

343
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:47,639
Please...

345
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:00,719
Oh, I'm sorn , you don't have to
if you really don't want to...

347
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,789
No, I'm just glad...

348
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,693
Here, I changed clothes.

349
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,528
Wow! It fits you just right!

350
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,564
Then, I'll go call Kaoru...

351
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,670
What's wrong with him?

352
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,572
I have no idea

353
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:28,680
Hey!

354
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:32,784
None of you watched my drama
seriously, so none of you really care!

356
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,152
Whoa! Calm down.

357
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,388
It finished rewinding...

358
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,824
OK, well just wait for Kaoru to come.

359
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,595
Huh? Where is she?

360
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,163
Well,

361
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,332
1, I tried calling her many times...
but...she didn't answer...

363
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,903
She may have become dizzy or
fainted in the bathroom...

365
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:56,541
Then, Mr. Kenzaki,
you should go check it out...

367
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,846
I think she's just sulky and
Iocked herself in the bathroom.

369
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:02,781
Huh?

370
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,883
There are bloodstains...

371
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,486
Ieading to the entrance.

372
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,222
Shoots.

373
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:12,491
Kaoru!

374
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:15,694
Now please come out from there...
Everyone is waiting for you!

376
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,163
Mr. Kenzaki, open the door!

377
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:18,997
What!

378
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,399
Now!

379
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,401
Kaoru! I'm coming in!

380
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,101
Kaoru?...

381
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,874
Kaoru?...

382
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:30,509
KAORU!!!

383
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:37,783
Ka, Kaoru!?

384
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,017
What ha ened?

385
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,420
How did this all come about?

386
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,421
She still has a pulse!

387
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:44,623
We must get her to the hospital
immediately. Her life depends on it!

389
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:46,491
Hurry!

391
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,499
Hey! What happened!
I heard someone shouting something...

393
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,202
Ka,Kaoru!?

394
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,140
Hey! Kaoru!! Are you all right!

395
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,842
Kaoru!!!

396
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,844
RAN! Call the ambulance!

397
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,577
Yes!

398
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,985
Ah~The victim is Ms. Kaoru Kusano,
20 years old.

400
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,955
Room number 1 on the 28th floor...

401
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:23,361
A 20-year-old living
alone in this luxury condo...

403
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,197
Some rich kid or something?

404
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:25,797
Huns

405
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,432
You don t know, Inspector?

406
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,167
The Earth ladies?

407
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,304
Earth what? What's that?

408
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,438
Oh, yes.

409
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,673
We're the police.

410
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,607
Please...

411
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,676
We're coming...

412
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:45,350
Oh. I'm sorry...
I must have the wrong room...

414
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:48,987
Oh! Inspector Megure.
We've been waiting for you!

417
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,894
Yahoo! Lots of TV celebs!

418
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,731
I see...Now let me ask
you one more time,

420
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,902
You three women were invited to
Ms. Kusano's engagement party...

422
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,238
And while she was in the bathroom,

423
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:12,511
you, one by one, changed into your
costumes in the rest room, to surprise her.

425
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,148
Ms. Okino, Ms. Takeno and
Ms. Hoshino in that order

427
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,618
And when three of you finished changing,

428
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,920
the manager, Mr. Makuma
went to the bathroom

430
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,356
to call her but there was no answer...

431
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,125
Next, her fiancee, Mr. Kenzaki

432
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,095
went to call her and
opened the door of the bathroom.

434
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,199
You found Ms. Kusano leaning on
the edge of the bath tub

436
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,967
and bleeding from the neck, right?

437
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,269
Yes...

438
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,038
And once AGAIN,

439
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,476
just like the devil had planned it,
at the scene of the crime, I run into

441
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,379
Ah...Don't be like that...

442
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,416
I just happened to be invited here
by Ms. Okino...It's just a coincidence.

444
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,051
It is not a mere coincidence but a
meaningful coincidence.

446
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,686
Or maybe better said, mere curse!

447
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,358
And?2Where:is: the victim,
Ms. Kusano now?

449
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,261
She's been transported to
Haido Hospital by ambulance...

451
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,766
We haven't heard from Mr Makuma,
who accompanied her to the hospital,

453
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,100
so, we don't know how she is now.

454
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:13,738
Kaoru...Is she going to die? Oh..,no...

455
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,609
Alri ht, Alri ht... I'll oo call the hos ital...

456
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,111
I'll go with you...

457
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,948
My dad often goes to see
the doctor at this hospital

459
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,450
because of his diabetes...
So I know the number...

461
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,986
Really? Great! Thanks...

462
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,626
And about the person
who cut her neck...

464
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,995
Do you think that the killer is
someone in this very room?

466
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,330
No way!

467
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,498
But, people often say that

468
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,935
the first finder of the body
IS the most suspicious...

470
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:48,139
Hey Hey ..l don't have
any reason to kill Kaoru

472
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:53,044
and when I found her in the bathroom,
that kid with glasses was with me!

474
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,046
Besides, he's the one who told me

475
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,815
to open the door of
e bath room to begin with.

477
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,316
Is that right?

478
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,151
Yeah! Because

479
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:05,022
there was blood dripping from
the hall into the entrance

481
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,659
And when I opened the entrance door,

482
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,329
I found that stuff lying there...so...

484
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:18,603
A rain jacket, work gloves with holes...
an eye dropper and a handkerchief.

486
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,540
We found them outside the front door,

487
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,977
so we laid them aside
before the ambulance came.

489
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,681
The rain jacket and gloves
are covered with blood.

491
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:33,018
This must be the clothes
that the criminal was wearing.

493
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,391
It's slight, but there's
a lipstick stain .on-the handke chief

495
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,894
If someone filled
this bottle withlanesthetic and

497
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,598
and he or she used
the anesthetic soaked handkerchief

499
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,767
to put her to sleep
before committing the murder...

501
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:53,505
But...who did it to Kaoru?
It's outrageous!

503
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,207
It's the stalker! He did to her!

504
00:17:56,208 --> 00:18:01,512
The stalker scared her,
playing spoo Â« dingdong Dash.

506
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,014
Ding-Dong...?

507
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,218
It's a trick of ringing the front doorbell
and then running away...

509
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,789
But it's not just a joke, it's a crime...

510
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:15,060
A strange note was always left
outside the front door...

512
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,262
It said, I'll come again

513
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,564
I'll come next time and

514
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,399
I'll come even if ll die

515
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:26,371
It got worse and worse over time

516
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:29,307
That creepy piece of paper
typed with a word processor!

518
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,376
I see...

519
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:37,882
That's why Ms. Kusano tried to hit me
out of blue when I rang the bell.

521
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,385
Was the door
Iocked at the time of the murder?

523
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,820
It was open...

524
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,289
There were lots of people here so

525
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,224
she may have felt safe
and left the door unlocked.

527
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,829
So, the stalker found the door left open,
went'inside the room,

529
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,364
came across Ms. Kusano

530
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:55,567
who had just come out
after taking a bath...

532
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,036
Then, because Ms Kusano
saw the stalker's face,

534
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,206
the stalker put her to sleep with medicine
and slashed her throat with a weapon...

536
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:06,044
The bloody rain jacket and
work gloves were disposed

538
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,380
of because they were too conspicuous
and would attract negative attention...

540
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:11,182
Then the killer fled...

541
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,118
Alright, Takagt!

542
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,653
Start poking around the condo,
Iooking for clues!

544
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,958
The criminal wore a rain jacket
on a day that wasn't raining.

546
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,427
There's got to be a witness...

547
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,361
Yes, Sir!

548
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:28,833
But I don't think anyone saw that person
because the person's very cautious.

550
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,802
Very cautious?

551
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:35,874
Well, if you were wearing
a bloody rain jacket,

553
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,876
you would step on the blood
that drips from the jacket, right?

555
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,878
But when I saw It,

556
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:44,315
there were no traces of footprints
at the bloody entrance.

558
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:47,285
This means that the criminal tried to avoid

559
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,521
stepping on the blood
whenirunning away.

561
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,790
That, That's right...

562
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,826
Eh? That's odd...

563
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,664
if the criminal saw
many shoes in the entrance way,

565
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,401
why did that cautious person
come into a room with so many people?

567
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,203
Inspector!

568
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,972
What if the criminal deliberately
walked with the rain jacket in hand

570
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,910
to make the blood drip
down on the hallway,

572
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:15,447
and then tossed them over outside,

573
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:18,516
in order to make it look like
he/she ran outside?

575
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,018
- La .

577
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:23,121
and if Ms Kusano was
acquainted with the aggressor,

579
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,423
the person could
call her without alerting her.

581
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,059
If she defenselessly comes
out from the bathtub,

583
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,894
then it wouldn't be difficult

584
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,630
to make her smell the medicine
and put her to sleep at the door...

586
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,166
Hey, wait!

587
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,402
You mean the murderer is...

588
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,606
could be one of us...

589
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,810
Is that right? Detective...

590
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:48,947
Terumi!

591
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,382
That's true...

592
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,718
The restroom that was used

593
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,988
as a changing room is between
the living room and the bathroom

595
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,058
Each of us would have had
a chance to commit the murder...

597
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,358
Even you...

598
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:05,262
Even so, Yoko couldn't have...

599
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:09,033
While she was changing,
we were waiting in front of the restroom

601
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,370
and after that, we went back
to the living room with Yoko.

603
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,706
Then I'm also clean...

604
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:18,143
When I found her, I was with this kid.

605
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:20,044
Yeah!

606
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,947
First when Kaoru went to the bathroom,

607
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,251
you very kindly accompanied her...
You couldn't have killed her...

609
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:29,087
Huh? You walked to
the bathroom with her?

611
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,989
Umm, yes

612
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,093
So, you had the chance to
attack her then?

614
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:40,064
OK, first, let me ask each of you...

615
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:44,736
But before that,
aren't you forgetting to do something?

617
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:45,737
Huh?

618
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,070
The deadly weapon...

619
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,508
The knife that was used
to cut Kaoru's throat.

621
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:54,945
If It's found in our belongings or indoors,
the criminal's among us...

623
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,515
Otherwise, the criminal
came from outside...

625
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,584
It's hard to think that,
after committing the murder,

627
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,185
a criminal from outside would
hide the weapon somewhere

629
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,887
in this condo at the risk of
being witnessed by one of us.

631
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,823
The criminal may have
wiped the blood from the knife,

633
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,092
and the hemoglobin of the blood
may be invisible to the naked eye...

635
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,928
But, luminol solution can detect

636
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,863
the small amount of
hemoglobin in the blood

638
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,899
It's not something you
can hide after all, right?

640
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,135
You're right...

641
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:21,973
Umm...what?

642
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:28,479
What on earth is she?
