1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:02,168
Suspense and deduction
closes the gap between

3
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,769
the love and hatred
between two people

5
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,638
Today. we're on the set of a drama

6
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,573
the members of the
cast are human too!

8
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,308
He sees through the
one and only truth,

10
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,509
a child in appearance
with the IQ. of an adult

12
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,379
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

14
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:54,714
Good evening everyone,
I am Detective Kogoro Mour.

16
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:59,318
The stage for today is
this remote western style building

18
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,323
A mystery entangled
with love and hate

20
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,660
The focal point of
this case is color

22
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,332
When people go shopping,
they tend to

24
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,435
unconsciously select
the color they like

26
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,673
even at the scene of a crime...

27
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,510
Let's meet again at
the end of the show

29
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,946
This was Kogoro Mourn.

30
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,750
Okay, cut!

31
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,821
Fantastic! Mr. Mourn,
you were just great!

33
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,390
Is that so?

34
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,860
Dad, you were really awesome!

35
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,595
Oh, yeah?

36
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:46,365
You could've cut out that wink
at the end of the scene, though...

38
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:53,372
YA AA
(RR)
Invisible Suspect
Part 1

42
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,812
Well, thank you so very much,
you were really a great help!

44
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,749
The big name actor who always
does the introductory remark

46
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,684
at the start of our show
caught a nasty cold

48
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,220
You don't have to use me just as a

49
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,356
pinch hitter, do feel
free to call on me anytime!

51
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,390
If itrs okay with you,

52
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,825
I. don't mind acting
in this -detective.-drams

54
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,460
as a special guest
or something either.

56
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,662
Oh, well, not really...

57
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,631
That's impossible, Mr. detective

58
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:23,001
Because, in this story

59
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:26,472
there are only 5 characters,

60
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,275
They are the widowed mistress,

61
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:37,450
her daughter the shrew, their
ecrepit butler and me...

63
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:40,386
Hey. what's with that shrew bit?

64
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,554
Come on, that's not nice.

65
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,355
I'm supposed to be a
character that slightly favors

67
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,990
- flashy things, that's
about all, isn't it?

69
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,626
The character turns out a shrewd
because you're the one playing the role!

71
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,328
What did you just say?

72
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,297
By the way, Kazami

73
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,236
I didn't like you remark, decrepit either.
I just turned 60. you know

75
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:02,074
I wasn't referring to your age.
I meant that your acting is decrepit.

77
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,309
What did you say?

78
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,512
I hear that you were a great actor
some time in the past. though

80
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:08,647
Now: now,

81
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,417
please calm down dad.

82
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,987
Let's not quarrel
just before shooting the film!

84
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,856
Mr. Kazami, please calm down

85
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,760
Ms. Ujo sure is late, though...

86
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,132
are you referring to that
Ms. Ujo who

88
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:30,002
used to be the number one
comforting actress, Ruri Ujo!

90
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,804
Uh, yes...

91
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,841
Y.You mean I get to see
Ms. Ujo in person?

93
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,675
What?

94
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,043
Get to see her in person?

95
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,412
She's the one who
named you to substitute to do

97
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,713
do the introductory
comment in the first place.

99
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:42,715
What!

100
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,286
I don't know if she's
some former healer type actress

102
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,124
I sure wouldn't want to be
healed by an old maid like her

104
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,261
My. the same to you

105
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:01,901
You're no more than a failure of
an idol kid, who smells like piss

107
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,906
Wow! You're really her!

108
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,875
Wow. you're even
prettier than on TV

110
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,212
Well, hello. hello.

111
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,548
How do you do?
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

113
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,083
I hear that you're the one who
named me to take: this job?

115
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,352
Oh, I don't think it's the
fist time we're meeting: is it?

117
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:20,853
Really?

118
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,489
Have we met somewhere before?

119
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:27,960
Oh comevyon! Doesn't this mole under
my lips remind you either?

121
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,862
Kogoro-chant!

122
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,665
M.Mole?

123
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:41,674
D...Doigaki...Ruri?

124
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:43,876
Bull's eye!

125
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:48,047
Rurippe?
Long time no see!

127
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,014
You can say that again!

128
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,849
We haven't seen each other
since junior high school!

130
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,052
It can't be...
They know each other?

132
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,588
Are you serious?

133
00:05:56,423 --> 00:06:00,693
I had no idea whatsoever!
Your last name is different too.

135
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:05,097
Besides, back than you were wearing
glasses with super thick lens

137
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,967
Well? I turned out
to be pretty foxy, don't you think?

139
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,802
You did, you sure did.

140
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:13,072
But, why haven't
you gotten married yet?

142
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,108
Being as beautiful as you are, I'm sure
you got a lot of guys to pick from

144
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,010
Don't be silly!

145
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:21,280
It's because one-sidedly in love with
you all these years, why else?

147
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:28,187
Please stop joking with him, because
he's bound to take you seriously.

149
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,322
My. who is she?

150
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,692
Oh, she just some
girl who lives in the neighborhood

152
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,594
I am his daughter, Ran!

153
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,430
Oh. then she's Eris?

154
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,533
Do you know my mother?

155
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:46,305
Yes, I was with her all the way from
kindergarten to junior high school

157
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,141
But, it still is sure a mystery...

158
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:54,213
as to whyygEri, the smartest
girl in school and Kogoro-chan

160
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,816
the most mischievous boy fell so
IOvey dovey in love as they did...

162
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,252
and finally ended
up marrying each other

164
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:01,787
Very true...

165
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,058
Oh, you mean they were in love
with each other for that long?

167
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,293
H. Hey...

168
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,397
Yes! Eri who always kept her cool,

169
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:14,600
would really get upset and go all out
when her counterpart was Kogoro!

171
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:20,906
So, we all took it to be a lover's quarrel,
and they were constantly being teased

173
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,310
they're still quarreling to this day...

174
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,178
What a surprise though,

175
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:30,015
that the lewd Kogoro that I used
to know is now a renown detective

177
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,723
Okay, let's start camera
rehearsal for scene 134!

179
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,426
Ready. start!

180
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:46,799
The corpse in.front of the fireplace
IS covered with a gray tablecloth

182
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,937
And the victim's black coat is hanging
on over the chair of that table

184
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:55,274
Near the corpse. on the floor

185
00:07:55,275 --> 00:08:00,879
Is the murder weapon, a golf
club with a white head cover on it

187
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,185
I guess we can say that
the case has already been solved...

189
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,587
Don't keep us in suspense,
spit it out!

191
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,923
Come on, tell us who it is!

192
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,058
Who on earth is the murderer?

193
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:18,364
I was actually supposed to
explain what went on but...

195
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,099
H.Hey

196
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,900
there's no such dialogue in the script 8

197
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,403
Tonight, Detective Mourn!

198
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,139
Let's have you solve the case!

199
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:33,010
First, tell us why the killer
covered the corpse with a tablecloth

201
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,647
T.That's probably because...

202
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,219
the Killer loved the vigtim...

203
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,053
that's why the killer didn't want
to leave the corpse just lying

205
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,956
there without doing
anything about it...

207
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,493
But, the coat was
, on the chair, you knows

209
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,827
Why would the killer go out of the way
to cover the corpse with the tablecloth

211
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,029
Oh. the reason is».

212
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,902
The gray tablecloth seemed to
be warmer than the black coat!

214
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:02,074
Hey: hey, don't tell me that you're
serious about what you Wst said.

216
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,409
Give me a break...

217
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,446
you were dropping hints in the
opening commentary yourself

219
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,582
Why does gray seem
warmer than black?

221
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:12,918
Really?

222
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,319
Don't you think so?

223
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,457
Your friend's not
all that great either, is he?

225
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,058
Dad. talk seriously!

226
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,430
Come on.
Get serious, Kogoro!

228
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:28,100
No way!
This is as far as this old man goes...

230
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,406
geez...

231
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,108
He's come out!

232
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,510
The Sleeping Kogoro!

233
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,813
Oh, excuse me.

234
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:44,416
Since the deduction was so simple.
I sort of felt like playing a bit of a prank

236
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,451
What?

237
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:50,789
It wasn't that the killer wanted to cover
the corpse with the gray tablecloth,

239
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,892
the killer didn't want: to cover the
corpse with the black coat

241
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,995
because the person, that is
the killer, likes the color black

243
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:01,933
It's most likely that the killer
sub-consciously thought that

245
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:07,072
using a favorite color at the scene
of the murder may bring on suspicion.

247
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,108
See, please take a
good look at the golf bag

249
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,510
that is left standing
against the fireplace!

251
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:17,749
Only the club with the black
head cover is sticking out, right?

253
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,786
This is because the killer was going
to use the-club with the black cover

255
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,387
as the murder weapon

256
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,022
but decided against it
while pulling it out.

258
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,824
This is evidence that the killer decided
to use the-white head cover instead.

260
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,861
Furthermore, taking into consideration
that the furniture in this room,

262
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:31,029
as well as the curtains are all
coordinated with the color black,

264
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,832
goes to show that
the owner of this house

266
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,436
that is. the killer is
wearing a black dress

268
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,205
Rurippe. ites the role you're playing

269
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,774
the mistress of this house!

270
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,546
don't you agree?

271
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,319
Wow, just as expected of
the Sleeping Kogoro!

273
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,154
He hit the bull's eye.

274
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,327
Just as rumor has it, you
didn't let us down, Kogoro!

276
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,165
I tell you, why didn't you start
off seriously to begin with

278
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,269
The real thing is
distinguished after all!

280
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,271
Corpses aren't supposed to move!

281
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,105
Dont move

282
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,308
Hey! Just what do
you think you're doing?

284
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,412
Are you okay. Nobuharu?

285
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,015
Kazumi?

286
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,418
So. after that playwright you're
switching over to that guy?

288
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:30,355
This was still supposed to
be off the records, right?

290
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,625
Hey you!
Enough is enough!

292
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,696
Are you we want
to talk to me like that old fart?

294
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:44,135
I Know about you secretly seeing a
young lover night after night, you know

296
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,003
What the?

297
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:49,608
I'm not really sure who
or where that lady is yet, but...

299
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,978
I sort of have an idea...

300
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,113
Yeah. I do have an idea...

301
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,082
Let me go!

302
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,557
What's with that look
on your faces, you guys!

304
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,659
I could make this program go down the
drain if you want it that way, you know?

306
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,928
What a bummer

307
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,032
I'm going to go take a snooze in the
room beyond until I feel more up to it,.

309
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,501
so go ahead and film the
scenes that I don't appear in.

311
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,952
What's with that guy...

312
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,121
He's the oldest son of the
owner of the newspaper agency.

314
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,522
That,is the main
sponsor for this program!

316
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:42,594
I see, that's why he knows so much of
what's going on behind the scenes

318
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:47,099
Yes, and to make things worse,
his obnoxious character

320
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,101
seems to be getting high
ratings among the viewers

322
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,004
To be honest, I really don't
want to act on a program where

324
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,706
he's the star of the show, but I
have no choice because my

326
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,808
office says I should,
since the ratifig is high

328
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,346
It doesn't bother me much. now that
I got to see you after so long, Kogoro

331
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,718
Okay, why don't we
take a 30 minute break

333
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,720
Okay. why dogs
we take a 30 minute break

335
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,022
Yes, sir.

336
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:12,157
What?

337
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,526
Fighting over sauce and shoyu?

338
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,495
You mean Mom and Dad?

339
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:20,632
Right, they got into a great battle
during home economics class

341
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,501
in elementary school over
whether sauce or shoyu

343
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,402
should be used on sunny side up!

344
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,038
Eri insisted«that sauce should be
used becausersunny side

346
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,305
up is a western.style dish,

347
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,575
but Kogoro insisted that the
Japanesesshould'use shoyu!

349
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,180
It puzzles me even more...

350
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,049
So. why'd they get married?

352
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:43,055
But, the order in which they ate whatgzr™
was made, was exactly the same,

354
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,890
«-) cw
so the entire class
burst out.laughing!

357
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,894
Next, they get into a fight saying,
Stop copying me!"

359
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:53,130
It's really hard to tell .~
whether they get along or not

361
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,234
Never mind about the past. already...

362
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,870
Ale please tell me more,
as much as you can!

364
00:13:58,871 --> 00:13:59,771
Hey...

365
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,044
W.What is it?

366
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,779
Oeo00dO.
Xxx fF

368
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,349
Snow...

369
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,851
See, it's snowing...

370
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,990
Oh, they did say that it. may snow
today on the weather-forecast

372
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,427
Hey. why don't we all go
outside and watch the snow?

374
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,264
But, we've only got
5 minutes of break time left!

376
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,700
Who cares. if it's only 5 minutes!

377
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,268
It's the first snowfall
this year. you know!

379
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,870
1. guess so!

380
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,405
Come on, let'shurry!

381
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,413
I love It when
it. snows after all...

383
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,148
right, Conan!

384
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,817
What seems to be the matter?

385
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,087
I don't see Ruri around...

386
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,390
Where's Ruri?

387
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,661
I thought I came out
together with her...

389
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,766
RRurippe!

390
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,573
Rurippe!

391
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:09,908
Rurippe!

392
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,575
Rurippe!

393
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,990
K.Kogoro!

394
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,695
No good, his pupils
are completely dilated...

396
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,798
He's already dead...

397
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,600
Ran! Call the police! .

398
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,868
O. Okay!

399
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:42,974
B.But, who did it? Who could've done
something so-ruthless like this

401
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,209
Beats-me...

402
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:47,612
He was the type to
make enemies so

404
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,015
B.But, in cases like this...

405
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:53,685
isn't it the routine to suspect the
one who first found the body?

407
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:59,958
N No. I didn't do it.
When I came to this room,

409
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,127
he was already smeared with blood!

410
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:05,263
T's true!
Please believe me, Kogoro!

412
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,965
Yeah, I believe you...

413
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,512
We won't be
fooled by your crying and all!

415
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,682
Actress crying is one of her weapons!

416
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,483
Hey. hey, Kasumi

417
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:29,454
But, if things go as is. we may also
be suspected of homicide, you know?

419
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,756
Everything"ll be fine
We'll be okay

421
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,295
The victim is
Mr. YoshikiiKazami-age 28!

423
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,233
The cause of death is loss of blood
due toxdamage to the carotid artery!

425
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:46,238
He was probably attacked
while asleep on this sofa here

427
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,807
and slashed in the
throat or something

429
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:55,480
Estimated time of death is between 19:50
when the victim came here to take a

431
00:16:55,481 --> 00:17:00,318
snooze to the time he was found dead
at 20:20, a period of 30 minutes!

433
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,420
I think it was shorter.

434
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:08,326
Because when we were
Iooking around this house and

436
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,396
and came into this room on the way,
he was snoring away and sleeping!

439
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,732
Hey. Conan!

440
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:17,702
That was just
around 20:00, right, Ran?

442
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:21,106
Y.Yes, because
Dad looked at his watch saying

444
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,774
that he was fast
asleep in 10 minutes...

446
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:26,278
It's Ran and Conan!

447
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,146
Which means that

448
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,483
Oh, Mr. Mouri!

449
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,287
So. you're here after all!

450
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:39,190
Thank you for looking after my
younger brother the other day!

452
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:43,060
Oh. no. that was really no big deal!

453
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:47,098
Kogoro, do you know him?

454
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,033
Yeah...

455
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:53,137
How do you do! I am Officer Yokomizo
from the Shizuoka Prefectural Police!

457
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:53,371
How [do you do! I am Officer Yokomizo
from the Shizuoka Rrefectural Police!

460
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:56,207
So. I've finally got
to meet you Mrs. Mourn!

462
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,810
Arm I wrong?

463
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:05,216
Well. I guess you're wrong,.
but then again maybe not

465
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,751
Wrong!

466
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,355
I'm only joking. it's a just a joke!

467
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:13,058
Wait a minute...
could you possibly be?

469
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,560
Don't tell, you're
Ruri Ujo, the actress?!

471
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,163
Y.Yes...

472
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:23,468
Wait a second, so are you, you and you!

473
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,839
What's going on here? Why are there so
many actors and actresses here

475
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,977
It's just as if you're shooting
a drama or something here.

477
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,879
That's 'what we're doing here...

478
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,950
so this is how it goes?

479
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,752
You were shooting a
detective story here at this

481
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,320
European style building out in the
boondocks of Mt. Fuji when,

483
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,891
a real homicide happened to occur!

484
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,862
So, this is indeed a
case of the biter being bitten...

486
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,697
Well. I guess so...

487
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,900
And? During the 20 minutes from 20:00

488
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,435
when the murder is thought
to havé been committed.

490
00:18:58,436 --> 00:19:01,206
The shooting was stopped so
everyone could take a break,

492
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,509
and all you staff members stayed
in groups of more than two people,

494
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,910
so all of you have an alibi.

495
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:10,482
The ones without an alibi are
Ms. Ruri Ujo, who found the corpse

497
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,450
and each of the acters and
actresses who went back

499
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,220
back to their respective rooms to
check the dialogue in the script

501
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,055
That is. Ms Kasumi Namihara

502
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,424
Mr. Akira Nagumo

503
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,093
Mr. Nobuharu Nagumo

504
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:25,130
the four of you!

505
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,031
Then, Ms. Ujo, please
explain in detail h "W

507
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,733
things were when you-first
discovered the corpse

509
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:30,735
Yes, sir!

510
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,504
Since we decided to take
a break, Kogoro here

512
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:38,743
and everybody else including myself
went looking around inside the building

514
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,979
Then, we noticed that
it began to snow

516
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,883
SO. we invited the staff to come along
and went outside to look at the snow

518
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,753
Since the snow was so beautiful

519
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:52,190
I wanted Mr. Kazami to take a 10Ok
at it too, so I came over to this room

521
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,394
He was sulky after going, through
what he did during film shooting too

523
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,430
But. when I opened the. door...

524
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,566
He was lying on the floor
smeared with blood

526
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:05,970
I thought he was joking and
shook him, but he didn't answer.

528
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:11,643
That's when I finally realized that
he was dead and screamed

530
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:17,781
I see, you three heard her
scream and ran over here

532
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,017
Yeah...

533
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,118
That's right!

534
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:26,558
Okay. will you four go into the other
room and ge through a body check.

536
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,060
Fl- NW

537
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:34,399
We can't find it,
It isn't anywhere in this building...

539
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,501
the murder weapon,

540
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,203
the knife with a blade of
about 10 centimeters long

542
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,671
that slashed Mr Kazami's throat...

543
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,545
Inspector Yokomizo!

544
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,647
How about it?
Did you find the weapon?

546
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:55,153
Well, all four of them
had nothing like that on them

548
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:56,921
We also checked the staff just in case,

549
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,324
and the other rooms
from one end to the other but,

551
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,293
things that could've been used as
the murder weapon were

553
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,928
only the knife in the kitchen, a
small knife for cutting fruit,

555
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:09,934
and a cutter knife that was found
in the tool box of the staff

557
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,472
We found no luminol
reaction on anything either!

559
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:20,745
The victim had on him was this pack of
cigarettes. this lighter, and his wallet

561
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,982
We're searching inside
the drains and

563
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:26,384
around the building with
a metal detector

565
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,586
but wethaven't got any report that
anything was found yet

567
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:35,560
dang. and we've already found
the golf club and coat

569
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:39,264
Why can't we find the-murder weapon?

570
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,733
Moreover, the glove and the coat are

571
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:43,233
props that are used
when filming dramas,

573
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:45,770
but, it seems that nobody was in
the room ring break time

575
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,472
where these things
were during break time

577
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,043
Which means that anybody
could=ve taken it:with considerable ease

579
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,413
And? Where are
the four"suspects now?

581
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:59,050
Have them waiting in the room
together with Mr. Mouri.

583
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,655
If the killer is among them

584
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,225
it would be impossible to
get rid of the murder weapon

586
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,661
murder weapon by-taking it somewhere
far away in such a short time!

588
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,163
And yet, why?

00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,065

591
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,368

eapon be found!
