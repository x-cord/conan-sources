you were: planning to have
an interview tomorrow too, right?"

91
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,435
Going back to the hotel in Miyazaki.

92
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,739
Then coming back again,
isn't that a waste of plane fare?

94
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,174
You couldn't have known before hand

95
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,026
that the interview tomorrow
was going to be cancelled,

97
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:39,211

Did you find what you forgot?

102
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,821
It must've been my mistake...

103
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:50,922
Thanks for this

104
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,058

105
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:56,561
By the way...

106
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,263
why are you all here?

107
00:04:58,665 --> 00:04:59,231
Well,

108
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,867
they say they re doing
another circumstantial investigation,

110
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,201
where Mr Nose was found dead.

111
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,770
Well

112
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,371
It's just to be sure .

113
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,175
Um. excuse me.

115
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,095
Are you left handed?

116
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:13,945
No...

117
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,616
But your caught the: key;
with your left hand just a while ago...

119
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,650
Oh...

120
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,384
It's a habit!

121
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,153
I used to be an ace number 4 player
of the baseball club until high school...

123
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,957
And...

124
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:26,191
And...

125
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:26,425
Huh?

126
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:32,064
Why did you use such a back street
to go to Mr. Nose's hotel?

128
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,567
The main roads around that area
are crowded just about that time of day...

130
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,204
That's why although
it's the long way around,

132
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,806
we can get to our destination faster
using the back road.

134
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,273
Huh?

135
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,675
Wait a sec...

136
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,076
. (P=
If ll remember correctly...

138
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:49,681
Hm sure that sure that...

141
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,218
This IS it!

142
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,439
I get it

144
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,031
So. that's what it was...

145
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,886
It's not that

148
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:11,920
He couldn't...

150
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,840
No doubt about it...

151
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,441
The killer is Mr Motoyama

152
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,112
He-<s the one who killed Mr. Nose.

153
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,182
He used the back road of the sky
to his advantage

155
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,105
Hmm...

157
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,056
Inspector!

158
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,127
I've finished asking around!

159
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,028
And. did you find any witnesses'

160
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,362
Well...

161
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,500
there was no one who passed by here...

162
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:44,903
just about the time
Mr. Ncose was killed around 9:30) am.

164
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,037
Hmm-nNnoe

165
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,007
witness. weapon nor evidence. eh...

166
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,576
Let's take it easy and take our time.

167
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,277
Inspector!

168
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,379
There's still a lot of time before it's time
for us to board our plane for Tokyo.

171
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,415
besides

172
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,048
If you think carefully

175
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:01,153
you may come up with evidence

176
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,521

Fool!

251
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,366
Fool!

252
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,000
You re talking about him sensing that
Mr. Nose was killed

256
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,601
Yourre talking Bout him sensing that
Mr. Nose was killed

261
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,336
just as soon as
he saw him lying on the ground,

265
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,303
right?

266
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,041
Tl at Mr. Motoyama sensed

267
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:07,012
It because he knew that. somebody
had been threatening Mr. Nose!

272
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:09,180
Lal)

273
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,051
Remember,

274
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,753
what Mr. Motoyama told me at the airport!

275
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:15,820
What?

276
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,722

Let's go. sonny!

280
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,406
So why does that
make him a great detective?

282
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:39,210
Because I was away
from you and*Ran back then

284
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,947
and talkingto the security guard.

285
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,181
Huh?

286
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,284
But you still could tell that
I was supposed to be with you.

288
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,654
That's what you call super deduction,
right?

290
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,257
C.Come to think of it...

291
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,142
That's strange.

292
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:55,427
Because this is the first time
we ever met...

294
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:56,311
Well,

295
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,896
I guess we can talk
it over having a meal...

297
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,064
Wow!

298
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,266
The place is packed!

300
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,868
I wonder if there are
an ..empt seats. ..7

302
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:05,654
E .en one!

303
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:06,988
This way! Over here!

304
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,374
He's found us seats.

305
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,209
But it's hard to get straight over there...

306
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:12,460
Okay. then!!

307
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:15,547
The back road!

308
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,452
There. I'm already here!

309
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,791
Taking the longer way,
got me here faster!!

311
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,306
Te 8 Re

312
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,508
As long as I get rid of this.

313
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:47,746
Nobody will ever be able to see

314
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,847
through the crime-that I...

315
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,700
I'm sorry,

316
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:54,034
but will you please

317
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:56,521
get the timetable from my bag?

318
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,124
I forgot what time our fight is.

320
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,663
3 fils

321
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,898
1. Thank you

322
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,339
Oh. that's right!

323
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,976
An acquaintance asked me to get him
a souvenir from Okinawa...

325
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,278
Will you tell everyone

326
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,814
to go ahead and finish the meal
without me,

328
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,616
because I want to go get
the souvenir first?

331
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,121
Well, after I'm done.

332
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,124
I'll buy some bread or something
and join you all...

334
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,393
Oh. all right!

336
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:02,520
Fiih

337
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,058
Kugh. kugh. kugh. kugh. kugh...

338
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,731
Ha ha ha. hall

339
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,364
Ha. ha, ha, ha!!

340
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,733
My. my...

341
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,767
Ha ha...?7.

342
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,103
Ou seem to be enjoying yourself a lot...

343
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,039
Your best friend passed away

344
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,141
and you look to be quite over
the grief already...

346
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:24,476
Well,

347
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,677
I guess it's only natural...

348
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:29,279
because you're the one who killed him...

349
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,516
D.Don be ridiculous...

350
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:35,487
You even said I have an alibi...

351
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,058
Nose was killed.

352
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,076
If I remember correctly...
at about 9:30 this morning...

355
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,663
I arrived on the 9:50 axm. flight

356
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,500
from Miyazaki to Okinawa, you know...

357
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,472
Moreover,
that is the only flight from Miyazaki.

359
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,711
And I was on the program that
as aired livein Miyazaki. wasn't 1?

361
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,782
So. how could I have killed Mr. Nose?

362
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,752
It's true that you couldn't come directly
from Miyazaki but...

364
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:15,193
But if you take the long way
around via To «0...

366
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,494
it's possible for you

367
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,130
you to set foot on Okinawa
before 9.30 in the morning!

369
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,132
Yes...

370
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,867
You avoided thercrowded main road.

371
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:27,272
And took the back road
which got you faster-to your destination...

373
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,610
You took the 8.35 pm fhght
from Miyazaki to Tokyo

376
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:37,115
and headed for Okinawa
on the 655 morning flight from Tokyo...

378
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,802
This woukfillow you
to arrive here at 9:20!

381
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:44,923
you went with that rental car

382
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,159
from the airport
to.Mr. Nose's road working course,

384
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,094
ambushed and killed him.

385
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:52,964
You returned to the airport by 9-150 am.

386
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,367
And pretended that
you just arrived in Okinawa,

388
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,037
then. came to see us!

389
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,406
WW. Wait!

390
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:03,957
I came out of
the Naha Airport arrival gate

392
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,612
this morning at 09:50. right!

393
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,082
Let's say I did come in on the 09:20 flight

394
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,185
and left the gate going outside once.

395
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:18,640
How was I supposed toaenter
the arrival lobby-again?

397
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:20,441
Well...

398
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:21,526
Well...

399
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,962
That's true...

400
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:25,997
See...

401
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:26,764
He...

402
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,833
M.Mr. Mour...

403
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,604
Wescame here because you said
you figured out who the killer-was.

405
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:33,838
Oh, well...

406
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:34,806
Talk about hopeless

407
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,241
Right. right. that'sright...

408
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,244
Why were the people
in the store a while ago

410
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,347
giving us strange looks?

411
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,148
OX WE

412
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,417
We went into therstore

413
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,887
sat down and left
without ordering anything...

415
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,521
Igllabet you're hungry

416
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,790
Would you like my juice?

417
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,692
Oh, yes, please!

418
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,062
You went into the store
and left without ordering anything...

421
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:00,899
Come to think of it,

422
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:05,803
the embarkatiOn and arrival floors of
Naha Airport are connected on the inside?

424
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,672
Huh?...Yes. that's right

425
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,107
Which means...

426
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,244
you could've just bought any ticket
and go inside from theembarkation gate

428
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,948
and come out from the arrival gate
without boarding the plane...

430
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,550
T. That's right, exactly!

431
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,486
Which means,

432
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,391
you still not being checked out from
the hotel in Miyazaki suspicious too...

434
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,627
If you came from Miyazaki to Okinawa
on this morning's flight,

436
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,231
you would've checked out
from the hotel in"Miyazaki...

438
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,301
If you also have an interview scheduled
in Okinawa tomorrow,

440
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,070
KE 3 Oh ee Laue dl) wow YR)

442
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,872
But. you couldn't do 50

443
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:45,259
because you were alrend, away
from Miyazaki at that time...

445
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:48,579
Isn't it because you were on board
a flight last night and already in Tokyo,

447
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,647
which IS mules away?

448
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,115
A.Any evidence?

449
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,585
Phooey! Of course we've got evidence!!

450
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:55,186
Right.

451
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,054
Mr. Mouri!

452
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,057
Huh? Aha. ha ha...

453
00:15:59,124 --> 00:15:59,958
Now. what was it?

454
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,261
Let's leave the rest up
to the renown detective!

456

that Mr. Motoyama

because we were on
beard that flight too...

474
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,760
My daughter happened
to spill tennis balls on board this flight...

477
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,131
The passenger in the next seat
elped pick up the balls...

479
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,266
He was among the passengers.

480
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,839
A suspicious man that caught
the tennis ball with his left hand...

482
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,674
WwW. Was that Mr. Metoyama?

483
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,543
But. isn't he right handed...?

484
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,879
A habit...

485
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,515
since he caught
so many balls with his left hand

488
00:16:57,566 --> 00:17:02,353
protect is right hand.

489
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,555
That's why he used his left hand

490
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,108
without thinking.

491
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,895

501
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,510
You're sweating!

502
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,677
You must be ho ¢

503
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,012
How about some juice!

504
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:47,165
Yes...

505
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,935
younsfingerprints on the tennis ball
that you picked up back then

507
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,704
IS evidence that you are the killer...

508
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,776
IS what I'd like to say: butithat's not how its

510
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,579
The surface of a hard tennis ball

511
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,317
Is fluffy making it difficult
or fingerprints te remain...

513
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,087
And. even if it were found on the ball.

514
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,224
It would only serve as proof that
you were on the same flight as we were...

516
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,427
It won't serve as proof that
ou killed Mr. Nose...

518
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,062
That's why

519
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,699
we deliberately made you steal the can
of tennis balls and made you swim.

522
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:23,901
flu? j

523
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,971
Because we figured

524
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,107
you would undoubtedly lead us
to the weapon

526
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,808
ou used for the murder

527
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,877
and the place you hid
the clothes splotched

529
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:33,761
with blood when you killed the victim!

531
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,814
This is unmistakably
immovable evidence!

534
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,184
how amazing that
you saw through everything

536
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,652
just by watching him catch
the can with his left hand!

539
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:43,054
Well. well.

540
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,256
I happened to remember that
Mr. Metoyama.

542
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:49,927
Though we met for the first time

543
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,295
called out to.this boy knowing

544
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,815
that he was with us
and everything fell in place!

546
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,334
I figured that maybe
Mr. Motoyama saw us all together

548
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,904
somewhere before seeing us
at the airport...

550
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:05,143
Well, even a snotty kid like him
can be of use at times...

552
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:08,146
I should've put him to sleep
with the tranquilizer gun after all...

554
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:10,081
Phooey... talk about ironic.

555
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,884
To think that my habit ended
my-baseball career,

557
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,536
and again with this habit of mine,
I dug my*own. grave. ry. sm»

559
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,106
Nose told me,
You've got a habit when pitching.

561
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,058
on my first season off

562
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:24,028
after I received the King of Rookie
and King of Save...

564
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,297
I checked myself over and over...

565
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:27,865
To the point of going neurotic...

566
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,169
Butfi-'Fmcouldnilafindiényghabitm;

567
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:32,203
Not only that

568
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:32,970
I damaged my shoulder

569
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,906
because of ever, pitching
during, the off season...

571
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,442
@O I thought:that it was strange

572
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:39,877
that after I resigned.

573
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,379
Nose suddenly became very friendly

574
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,149
and introduced me to TV jobs and such...

575
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,350
Then last mo; th.

576
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,487
After-coincidentally seeing the VTR of
a sports variety program before editing.

578
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,589
+1 finally understoodwhy he did so...

579
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,925
WALLA

580
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,594
Are there any other interesting stories?

581
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,796
Mr. Nose, please tell us!

582
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:03,601
It's easy to get rid of a young pitcher...

583
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,503
All I did was whisper

584
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,305
that héghad*a habit
and he self-destructed...

586
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,772
What...

587
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,441
Cut the part out!

588
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:11,676
Cuz ll don't want trouble...

589
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,010
Are you. serious?!

590
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,213
No, it's something
I heard from somebody: else!

592
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:18,232
NOS,

593
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:21,185
I never had a habit to begin with...

594
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:21,685
! } JA

596
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,221
I felt obligated to him
and swayed between joy

598
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,389
and sorrow for his actions
as the guardian of the Jaguars

600
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,924
Jaguars as if they were my own...

601
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:32,463
hat I'm so vexed and wretched...

602
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,198
Is that why yeu killed him.

603
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,433
Yes...

604
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:41,372
I kept him {from making
his Japan 'save record...

606
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,175
Using Hideyoshi'swgreat revenge trick

607
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,180
All I did was let him know

608
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:53,317
that I was the one
who was supposed to win the fame!!

610
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:54,719
No...

611
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,589
you would've never made
the Japan record.

613
00:20:58,824 --> 00:20:59,257
What?

614
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:03,243
I feel sorry for the fact that
ou were deceived but...

616
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:07,131
a stopper is
the last stockade for the team.»

618
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,835
Even if you're beaten and battered
no mattered if you're'jeered at or-what...

620
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,903
If your turni'to:play comes up.

00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,073
Yousve got to stand on the mound
as if nothing happened! -

624
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,944
I don't think:'a guy who: loses himself

625
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:23,731
and'commitsgmurder can
shoulder the fate of a team...

627
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:27,318
0000

629
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,755
