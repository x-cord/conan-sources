and the breeze is invisible,

00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:06,172
deductions take all shapes and styles
in each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,107
Today is a special of a cursed mask.

6
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,243
A mysterious room and an eerie smile.

00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,111

30
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:19,705
Sigh

31
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:23,442
Uh, that person called Suou
used to be a famous singer, right?

33
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,577
Yeah,

00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:28,414

once called "Canary of the Orient.

36

44
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,767
Talk about dangerous!

45
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,436
Why is this tree in the middle of

47
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,772

00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:52,992
shouldn't we ask to be let in?

why are we going in separately?

151
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,639

Disaster befalls...?

166
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,497

167
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,700

Next, it's the mask of a cat...

177
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,492

179
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,894

Huh? Mr. Moun?

183
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:28,080
So this room connects the east and west
wing of the mansion.

185
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,615
Wow, this is fantastic!

186
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,550

A remote control...?

190
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,545

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,413

192
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,686
Hat's with all these masks...

193
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,089
What is all this...

00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,024
What're are all these masks...?

195
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,426
These are called the masks of Chableu...

196
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,294

214
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,613
Uh, yes, well I guess you could say...

215
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,349
You just mentioned
the masks of Chableu,

217
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,885
but are you referring to the masks
overing the sides wall...

219
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,621
Yes, it is said that the Spanish sculptor,

220
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,091
Chableu Gonzales made it
just before he died.

222
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,960
It was the 200th mask that he made.

223
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,430
It ls also called the "Cursed Mask."...

224
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,630
Huh?!

225
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,032
Cursed mask?!

226
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,836
Uh, what is this
rsed mask all about...

228
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,973
Chableu Gonzales,
IS a sculptor of tragedy.

230
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,509
Although over flowing with talent,

231
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,178
trapped by the jealousy of his brother,

232
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,848
his fame, glory and estate were
all taken away from him.

234
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,985
Chableu who became
very wary of people,

236
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:16,822
began making masks
as if obsessed by something.

238
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:21,393
After finishing his 200th mask,
he killed himself.

240
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:25,063
The masks that were scattered around
his body were splattered with blood\\\_

242
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:29,001
and the masks looked 'to havebsucked
the blood themselves.

244
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,137
Since then,
Chableu's reputation was restored,

246
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,474
and his masks were handed down to
various people.

248
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:39,878
However, many who owned the masks
seemed to died tragic deaths.

250
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:44,249
An English head of the bank,
fell off his horse

252
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,353
the following day after getting hold of
one of the masks, and died.

254
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,624
A French jeweler was attacked
by robbers and killed...

256
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,760
And with the passing of time,
this mask was called,

258
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,630
The cursed mask that sips
the blood of its owner,

260
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,832
and was feared by people.

261
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:05,103
Are you all right,
owning all 200 of such masks...?

263
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:06,904
No need to worry.

264
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:12,177
I had a great clairvoyant seal the curse in

265
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,514
It's starting to get more and more occult
around: here...

267
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,516
But, Ms. Suou,

268
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:22,321
the evil will of a living person may be
even more frightening than a curse.

270
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,856
Oh, what do you mean?

271
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:28,861
Well, on our way here,
out path was blocked by a fallen tree,

273
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,796
and we found this pinned to the tree.

274
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:36,268
Mr. Mouri! I received a similar sort of
Ietter three days ago!

276
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,002
Huh?!

277
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,271
1, I got one too!

278
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:40,539
Same here...

279
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,007
What?!

280
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,010
It seems to be more than just a prank...

281
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:45,811
Whaaa!

282
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,549
Touya, you're late.

283
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,485
I'm right in the midst of
a nation wide tour

Touya Aikawa

292
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:55,754
Give me a break for being tardy.

293
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:57,890
Who is he?

294
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,225
Oh, Conan, don't you know him?

295
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:04,296
He's the most popular rock singer
these days, Touya Aikawa.

297
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,498
You received a strange letter?

298
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,367
The name of the sender is not written.

299
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,369
The lettering of the name of
the addressee is also odd.

301
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:16,108
It seems a rulerwas used so that
the handwriting cannot be identified.

303
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,510
May I open it?

304
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,113
Yes, please do

305
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:26,351
11S 15...

306
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,622
The.cursed mask will sip blood tonight...

307
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,691
From the messenger of
the cursed mask...

309
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:37,229
Ms. Suou, you'd better call the police...

310
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,298
There's nothing to worry about.

311
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:45,303
Ever since I've started the charity show,
I've been bothered by pranks like these.

313
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:53,111
Yes, this stew Is very delicious indeed!

314
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,781
This wine sure is good too!

Talk about top class!

320
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:01,353
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am greatly thankful that

322
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,289
you have all pleasantly accepted
to appear as guests

324
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,326
¥ on-the chari. show that I will be hosting.

325
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:11,529
Ms. Suou, may I ask you a question?

326
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:12,998
What is it?

327
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,634
How did you come across the idea of
saving children

329
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,803
whose parents who have become
victims of traffic accidents?

331
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,541
I started charity about 15 years ago.

332
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:29,748
But, to tell the truth,
» my manager caused a hit-and run case...

334
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,082
A hit-and-run?

335
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,085
Yes... ever since then,

336
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:37,154
I could not stand being
indifferent to traffic accidents...

338
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,760
There are people saying that
shggis-a-publicity seeker

340
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,096
-g¥utlit'ssreally-not anything likesthat.

341
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,000
Um...what happened to the manager
<after the incident». .?

343
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,001
She-committed suicide.

344
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:49,935
What...?

345
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,471
That manager happened to be
my mother.

347
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:53,805
You: mother...?

348
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:57,009
Since I lost my father at a young age,

349
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,878
after my mother died,
I was sent around to my relatives' homes.

351
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,947
I really had it tough

352
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:06,351
But, Ms. Suou here helped me
In every way she could...

354
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,421
I'm what I am today, thanks to Ms. Suou!

355
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:15,060
Touya's mother was more a cherished
friend of mine than a manager.

357
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,462
There are many at Kurenai Productions

358
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,399
that have lost their families
in traffic accidents.

360
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,235
Ms. Suou is puttingda lot of effort
inthelping the:children

362
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,202
of traffic accident victims,
become independent.

364
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,606
Kugh! What a touching story!

365
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:32,944
I'll cooperate as much as I can
at your charity show next week!

367
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,413
Same here.

368
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,717
In fact, I lost my wife in a traffic accident
20 years ago...

370
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,119
I'm sure that my wife in heaven is happy

371
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,455
that I'm going to be taking part in
Ms. Suou's charity show too...

Yes, I know.

382
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,268
You'd like me to figure out the one
who sent out those letters, right?

385
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,740
Well, I wonder if you can check in detail

386
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:05,210
on the traffic accident
that took Mr. Katagiri's wife.

388
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,279
Mr. Katagiri's... 7?

389
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,880
May I ask you why...7?

390
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,483
There is something that bothers me...

391
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:14,419
Would 2 million yen be enough to do it?

392
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,021
2 million yen?!

393
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,423
I'd be more than glad to!

394
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,332
You're pretty good, King of Homeruns!

395
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,400
It's just luck!

396
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:37,409
Mr. Mouri, this year is a good year
for you to begin something new.

398
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,944
What, really?!

399
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:43,448
Why then Mr. Mouri, how about making
a debut as a singer from our company?!

401
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,082
What, a singer?!

402
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,952
I'm sure it'll make a great hit if it is sung

403
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,354
by the detectives f the Heisei Era,
Kogoro Mourt!

405
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,256
I guess I'll sing you a song then...

406
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,424
We're sorry...

407
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,558
Oops!

408
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:57,028
Everyone,
when the clock strikes midnight,

410
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,499
we have a tradition of locking the door
of the-room--oftMmasks.

412
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,033
When the door is locked,

413
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,504
we will not be able to pass back and
forth between the east and west wings.

415
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:10,475
Therefore, we would like you to go into
your rooms before that.

417
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,213
Midnight is still too early
o hit the sack...

419
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,884
Is there a reason for locking the doors
at midnight?

421
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,286
Theymasks of Chableu like pranks

422
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,022
and begin playing
(on their own come midnight.

424
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,526
Therefore! we must lock the doors
and keep them confined.

426
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,461
T, That's ridiculous

427
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,329
It's true.

428
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,332
Come morning
the masks are tilted unnaturally,

430
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,201
or down on the floor.

431
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,136
This has happened many*timesstill now.

432
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:43,041
Now, please go into your rooms,
'everyone.

434
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,579

Hee-hee-hee-hee! Ha, ha, ha!

446
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,383
Who are you?!

447
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,986
Messenger of the cursed masks...

448
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,854
Messenger of the cursed masks?!

449
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:04,322
What the?!

450
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:05,522
Hand it over!

451
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:06,524
Hey!

452
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,461
The cursed masks are starving for blood.

453
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,130
Who will be the sacrifice?

454
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,331
WwW What?!

455
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,267
You'd better hurry before it's too late.

456
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,201
Kugh!

457
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,270
Hat bastard...

458
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,808
Kugh! It's locked!

459
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,545
Ran, Conan, wake Honami up
and bring the key to this room!

461
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,213
Okay!

462
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:33,685
Hah!!

463
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,635
Ss locked...

464
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,305
The phone a while ago was
from an extension...

466
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,640
The person's in this mansion...

467
00:17:58,544 --> 00:17:59,444
Dad!

468
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,445
Honami, please give me the key!

469
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:06,718
Aaaagh!!

470
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,126
The masks of Chableu are gone...!

471
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,529
What is the meaning of this...

473
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,266
What the?!

474
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,068
Hat was that...

475
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,003
It came from above...

476
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,539
Ms. Suou's bedroom?!

477
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:30,809
You can't go that way!

478
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,608
What?!

479
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:35,947
In order to get to her room, you have to
take the stairs on the west side...!

481
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,015
Ugh...

482
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,654
his door is locked too...

483
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,322
I'll wake Minaho
and make her open the door!

485
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,391
Hey, what on earth is this racket about...

486
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:47,926
In the middle of the night...

487
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,462
Aaagh?
He masks of Chableu are gone...?

489
00:18:58,436 --> 00:19:00,204
What on earth is going on?!

490
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,482
Ms. Suou! Ms. Suou!

491
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,284
Kugh, this door is locked too!

492
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,953
Crack that glass!

493
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:15,620
Hmm?

495
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,225
Mr. Mourn,
just what are you going to do...?

497
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,961
Is anything wrong with Ms. Suou??

498
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,674
Hey, how's Ms. Suou?!

499
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,444
It seems that she's hurt.
She bleeding badly!

501
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:40,045
What?!

502
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:43,048
The masks of Chableu are scattered
all over the room!

504
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,582
The masks of Chableu?!

505
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:45,650
Aaaagh...!

506
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,652
Re there any other entrances...?

507
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:48,520
Agh?!

508
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,522
There's another door over there!

509
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,190
That door's no good!

510
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,426
It's been sealed off
for quite a while already!

512
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,427
Hoots...

513
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,163
I'll go in from there
and check out the inside!

515
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,166
I guess there is no other choice...!

516
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,435
Dad! Here you go!

518
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,973
We're counting on you!

519
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:09,641
