Someone been killed, and Sonoko and I
were also attacked and we're in trouble!

320
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:20,565
Hey?! What! Are you in the
middle of running away from the killer?

322
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:26,337
No, We're alright now..we're not hurt,
we're with the police right now...

324
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,239
And? 'Who was killed?

325
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,976
A.man called\Miyama
who was 'staying insthe same hotel as us!

327
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,413
Then, were you attacked
because you saw the killer?

329
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:39,584
NO, we didn't see him...
We found out:that the man was killed only

331
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,586
after the police informed us...

332
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,789
What? You mean, were attacked
despite the police being there?

334
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,127
No. we were attacked on
our way back from the police!

336
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,263
It was too dark to see who it Was though...

337
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,032
Issthe one who attacked you. the killer?

340
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,366
con. NOW.

341
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,101
That person ran off with Sonoko s bag so
maybe it was just a purse snatcher

343
00:13:58,102 --> 00:13:59,654
He 7!
Wait! What are you doing!! Give it bac
That person ran off with Sonoko's bag so
maybe it was just a purse Snatcher .

348
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:02,106
He 7!
Wait! What are you doing!! Give it bac

350
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:02,440
He 7!
Wait! What are you doing!! Give it bac
Why did you go to the police at night?

353
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,176
Why did you go to the police at night?

354
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:09,981
Sonoko remembered there was
something written on the window

356
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:15,887
where the man, was killed so
we went to the police tell them about it...

358
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,722
What writing?

359
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,425
Yeah...some kind of a code...

360
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,227
A code?!

361
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,997
Hey! What are you:so happy about?!
Someone died you know...

363
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,982
Um, Sorry» .

364
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,202
And. what was written...

365
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:36,808
Yeah... According to. Sonoko, it was written
in red by something similar to lipstick...

367
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:42,730
There-were 4 alphabets written
in"small letters. telu...

369
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,199
Teiu?

370
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,388
Yeah. so Sonoko thinks :.
The: victim probably left a message...

372
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,659
It's notiprobablyly
I That is definitely a.dying message!

374
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,297
The; victim probably wantedOto say teiuka

375
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,500
He's, he's, "8...

376
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,402
S:sOnoko...

377
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,704
It Is so-called...!

378
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:12,777
The teluka homicide!

379
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,412
Huh?

380
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,650
What?! "The teluka homicide"

381
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,686
Huh?! Hey! Sonoko!! Quit fooling...

382
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:26,324
I'm not fooling around!
A man called Miyama:was killed

384
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:30,495
and on his window were the letters telu!

385
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:35,233
Teiu. "teiuwithithe, letters
telu thentit mustibe:teiuka"

387
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:39,170
that he wanted.to leave as a message?!

388
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:45,643
When we met Mr. Miyama on the beach.
He kept using the,word teiuka.

390
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:51,049
Uh huh! So whatever you say,
it's "The.teiukahomicide

392
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:57,422
Was the "I" in "teiu
the alphabet "I"?

394
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:02,327
Huh? 1? Yeah maybe...

395
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,862
So:what if it is?!

396
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,898
Nd the fourth letter
wasn't the length of the right side

398
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,834
a little shorter than the left?

399
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:10,902
Huh?

400
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:14,339
So I'm asking if it wasn't the hiragana "shi"!

401
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,676
Hmm...? Now that yousmentioned it...
It mightihaveibeén that...

403
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:24,615
Think of the "shi" coming right
after the alphabets "tel".

405
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,986
Tel...tel shim?

406
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:34,158
I get it! "please tel it means "please call
and he was trying to" call for help this way!

408
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,961
I knew you could do it Shinichi!

409
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:40,031
Uh huh. your hubby Is great. great!

410
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:45,536
H,he's not m hdbb. ,1
What are you saying Sonoko!

412
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:45,737
Hey, Ran, your face...it's red!
H. he's not mm hubb
What are you saying Sonoko!

415
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,705
Hey, Ran, your face...it's red!
Ahem! And?
In what situation was the man killed

418
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,108
Ahem! And?
In what situation was the man killed

420
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:53,578
Oh yeah...according to the police.

421
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:58,716
He was-lying onithe floor bleeding from
his head. near'the window-of.the hotel...

423
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:02,487
He was hit byfsomething hard from the back

424
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:10,795
If he was trying to write tel shite, that
guy probably wrote it with his own blood...

426
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:11,996
What?!!

427
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:17,251
It was red, right? The letters...
And, who found the body?

429
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:21,239
The 3:friends of Mr. Mlyama Who was killed!

430
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:25,810
If I'm not mistaken,
Mr Kino the classmate of Mr. Miyama.

432
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:29,247
Miss Yanuma. Mr Miyama's girlfriend

433
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:33,251
and Mr Bito a colleague
at a part-time job they both worked for

435
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,421
Mr. Miyama and the the
were planningto have dinner together

437
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,022
so they went to his room to ¢e shim
because he didn't come.

439
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:42,860
They found the door unlocked
and the window broken

441
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,029
Mr..Miyama was found
on the floor near:the window

443
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:50,435
This is what they testified to the police...

444
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,570
The window was broken?

445
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:59,544
Yeah, that's why the police say
the killer broke in from the window,...

447
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:04,916
When Sonoko went to the-police about
the letters that were written on the window

449
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:09,720
The didn't find an thing of that
sort among the broken pieces of glass...

451
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:14,992
The letters ""'teiu were not understandable
so wouldn't behave us anther...

453
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:20,698
So I toldfthe police!
I'd"bring the evidence!

455
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:24,802
Hey, hey, Sonoko?!
Do you really have it? The evidence...

457
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,737
Yeah, remember I sent it to you Kudo?

458
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,372
Huh...?
What?!

462
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:32,944
The special sexy shot of Ran that
I took with my cell phone!

464
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,130
Noticed the . red letters
before I took the picture

466
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:38,216
so it should be in the background
of Ran's:picture!

468
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,285
Hey! What do you mean by should
You raven ci1ec ec .

471
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:46,491
No I thought left
my cell phone. back at the hotel.

473
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,861
So-we headed back
from the police station to go get it...

475
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:53,531
But; half way back,
realize thatlit was in my bag.

477
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,766
So we were heading back to the
police station again when

479
00:18:55,767 --> 00:19:00,137
I was unfortunately mugged
and my bag was taken!

481
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:04,442
I didn't want to be called a liar so
I told Ran to call you and

483
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:08,212
ask you to send me back-that picture!

484
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,347
Huh?

485
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:15,553
I told her that .you probably erased it
so it would be no:iuse...You erased it. right?

487
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,356
Uh, yeah...of course...

488
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,091
See]

489
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,358
Really?

490
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:27,265
Well anyway. you know the moaning
of the letters now. so go tell the police!

492
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:31,135
Okay!:I:ll:call If something comes up!

493
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,937

Ummm...picture:. picture...

496
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,081
Ah...the red letters...

497
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:49,253
There's: something written
on the window just like Sonoko said...

499
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:53,391
The, curtain is closed so
It's not possible to look inside the room...

501
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,027
Sdly the letter t" which is hidden
behind RA"$ hips iS in view...

503
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:56,294
Only the letter "{" which is hidden
behind RA's hips is in view...

505
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,528
Hmm? There's something written

507
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:02,133
Hmm? There something written

cold DO e GOtmlme OF & ello GF no [pom

510
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:10,208
What a weird killer
If the dying message were to be "tel shite

512
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,844
Some time after committing the murder,
he must've noticed the writing and

514
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,464
broke the window to retrieve
the pieces with writings on them.

516
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:20,218
Even if it were to be an attempt to delay
the discovery of the body,

518
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,720
breaking the window would risk
attracting more attention

520
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,389
and hastening the discovery.

522
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,793
What are you looking at, Conan?

523
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,711
What, what?

524
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:31,762
What is it?

525
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:36,334
'Wow: hey,
that's! It'sta:woman"s nude.lisn't it?!

527
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,935
What!

528
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:41,772
Conan! It might be against the law
if a grade schooler looks

530
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:44,342
atfa picture like that!

531
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,943
It's not...

532
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:50,214
Hahaha. ..it's Just spam mail

533
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:55,786
When I accessed the site to the mail
I just happened to get this picture...

535
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:59,690
By the way,
were you able to decipher Doc's code?

537
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,143
No...Not at all...

538
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:04,228
No way!

539
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,764
If even you can't, how could we

540
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:12,336
We borrowed the paper with the code
Maru mushi mi tent...

542
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,472
Maru mushi...

543
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,774
I wonder if we'll really be able to find
the site of the treasure

545
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,643
after deciphering this code?

546
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:22,947
If I were to choose,
I would rather have come here

548
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,049
for the festival Dr. Agasa went to

549
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:31,489
Festival...?Wasn't that festival
called the Tento Festival...

551
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,125
What?! What did you just say

552
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:38,129
Yeah! You can see the shrine gate
that lit up. right?

554
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,366
Doc said that it's a village festival and
the float starts from there.

556
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:48,372
Then the "tent" in the code points
to the Tento festival?

558
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:52,443
Even so, I still don't understand
the maru mushi part...

560
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:57,114
I still think it has something to do with
the Marumushi hot spring inn?

562
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,450
3ut-that-place was closed down

563
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:05,323
The entrance was closed
and no one answered our calls...

566
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,791
What is it?

567
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:11,295
Hey... look! Something's getting bright!

568
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:16,500
That's where...
Marumushi hot spring is located...

570
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,539
Maru mushi ni lento...
does that mean to light itaup?

572
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,508
T.that's«it] That must b it!

573
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,377
I'm getting it!

574
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,313

575
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,182

You guys give up too easily!
