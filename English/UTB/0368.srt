00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,779
and Mr. Maeda found the dead body

287
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,448
when he-came back
from the office. Am I right?

289
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,249
Yes.

290
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,486
Ms. Morimoto. you
were the only one here.

292
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,822
Didn't you notice anybody coming in?

293
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:38,656
IN. mo...

294
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:38,990
IN. mo...

295
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,960
The back of the victim's
head was severely injured

297
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:45,163
There could be a murder
weapon inside the museum.

300
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,432
Search throughout the museum!

301
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,700
Yes sir!

303
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,702
One of the chefs must
have killed Ms. Hashigaki

305
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:54,639
Then, the type of the»weapon
and how it was disposed of ,

307
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,741
would be the key to finding the suspect.

308
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:01,178
I think either Maeda or Fujino
must have killed Ms. Hashigaki.

310
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:02,279
What are you talking about!?

311
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:08,452
Yeah, it's gotta be, :because
you both were having trouble

313
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:11,156
with &hief Maeda,
owed her a lot of money,

315
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,858
and Fujino wanted to go independent.

316
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,662
Well. we aren't the only ones who were
having trouble with the Chief, were we?

318
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,397
What do you mean

319
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,467
She wanted to.quit the
candy-making performance,

321
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,403
because she was too confident
in the taste of her candies.

323
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,706
You were having an argument with
Chief right before she was murdered,

325
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,176
werenst you? I heard your
voice all the way across the hall.

327
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:36,147
It's true that Ms« Morimoto was having
an argument with Ms Hashigaki

329
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,217
Let me act as a chef!

330
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:43,404
It's possible that Ms. Morimoto
murdered the chief

332
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:49,327
Each kitchen is divided with partitions, so
nobody can 'see Ms. Morimoto from here.

337
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:54,499
But the same applies to the other
chefs too. The big tree gets in the way.

339
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,370
So. nobody can see what's going
on here'fro'm Ms Morimotds kitchen.

341
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:04,409
That means. the other two chefs
could've murdered Ms. Hashigaki as well.

343
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,445
You left here right after I left, right?

344
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,348
Don't you think it took
too long just to find the kid?

346
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,251
The east space is huge.
It'senot easy toxfind a person there.

348
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,452
Let me ask you then...

350
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:14,786
Let me ask you then...

351
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,555
Don't you think it was TOO good
timing that you got a phone call?

353
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,259
The phone was already
cut when I answered the phone.

355
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,261
This us got-ta be a setup!

356
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:28,399
You could've been the one who called
and told yourself to come to the office.

358
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,567
You bastard!

359
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:33,238
Weill find out who killed
Ms. Hashigaki when we find the weapon!

361
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:37,809
Just to let you know, you are
the one who could kill Boss the easiest.

364
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:38,843
Right!

365
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:39,077
Ri ht!

366
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,314
The cakes are almost gone, huh? It's crazy.

367
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:44,465
HMM 7

370
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,690
A piece of wood

371
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,727
Sir! No weapons were found

372
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,162
Hmm. nothing was found...

373
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,965
Ah. the weapon isrgoneybecause it's
been eaten-already.

375
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,700
Can we think this way?

376
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,802
What do you mean by that?

377
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,005
This is a candy house.

378
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,073
It's possible that
the weapon was made of sweets.

380
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,777
Who would eat stuff
that was used to kill somebody?

382
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:18,616
But if we think that way,
the typesrof sweets would be limited.

384
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,001
It's not cookies

385
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,419
They would break

386
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,588
Not pies or tarts of course.

387
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,524
It can't be my chocolate.

388
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,660
Mine as well. is pretty soft.

389
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:29,127
Now what!

391
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:33,932
You're saying I killed her with,my gandy
and ate the sweet bloody weapon?

394
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,636
- - q 4
A candy as a murder weapon...
It's too big to.eat...

397
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:38,953
- - AA

398
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,438
Oh. I'm sory...

399
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,341
Maybe; shelmelted the candy.

400
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,008
What?

401
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,145
She put the candy into a pot
that was heated up beforehand

403
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,379
Is that what you are saying?

404
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,881
Didn't do that!

405
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,551
She could be the one
who did these things

407
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,753
because nobody could hear
or see what she was doing.

409
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,723
I. 1 didn't do it! Please!

410
00:15:59,491 --> 00:15:59,757
Well

411
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:03,494
we'll find out. whether it's true or not,
after the identification

413
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,564
$s she the killer...

414
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:11,336
It's my dream to win a contest
with these candies, someday...

417
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,805
NO./Zit canst be...

418
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,902
Yeah, She cannot be the murderer.

419
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,893
This is...

420
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,936
How come pieces of wood
are in the kitchen?...

422
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,540
There was no
Wood chocolate making trial

424
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,109
when I came here yesterday.

425
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:52,910
I got it!

428
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,183
80 she W 'S being used...

429
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,252
But...it's not gonna go like that!

430
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,323
No...the murderer ls...

433
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,325
on ..an...

436
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,060
Hm! 2?

437
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,531
SS. Sonoko!?

438
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,437
Not, Ms. Morimoto.

439
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,906
Sonoko! That thing again!?

441
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,944
She was trying so hard) to, make

442
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,914
candies for the afternoon to convince
the chief that-she was good enough.

444
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:35,203
There are candies in her kitchen
for tasting. if you wanna see.

446
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,557
Ran, could you show everybody
the thing in my left hand?

448
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,059
Hm? OK...

449
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,601
Yes,

450
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:55,039
\\ looks like it is for tasting...

451
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:57,208
That piece of candy tells us

452
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,378
how-mueh she wanted
to be a chef andOnot a magician.

454
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,147
I just wanted her
to taste this one more time

456
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,349
Then,
who on earth murdered Ms Hashigaki?

458
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,717
The real suspect is...

459
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,887
The "Prince of Sweets

460
00:18:10,138 --> 00:18:12,589
Mr. Fupino! It's you...

461
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,058
First of all

462
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,027
you called Mr. Maeda by phone

463
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,361
just to let him out of here.

464
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,831
Then, after making sure
Ms. Morimoto started using the blender

466
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,432
you left the kitchen.

467
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,335
From-this point. you can't see a thing of

468
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,204
what's going on
in Ms. Morimoto's kitchen.

470
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,574
Mr Fujino used this blind spot!

471
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,829
So are youisaying killed her with candy?

473
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:54,999
it's the wood chocolate!

474
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,735
Really! My wood chocolate?

475
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:00,137
That soft chocolate killed a person?

477
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,473
Let me explain!

478
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:07,178
It seems-that-this candy-house
IS totally made of sweets

481
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,748
the truth is that this is a wooden house
that's coated with sweets.

483
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:14,085
This was how he came.up with the plan

484
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,155
hiding the murder weapon
under the sweets

486
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:18,222
What!?

487
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,858
So he hid the weapon under
the wood chocolate, am I correct?

489
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:21,592
Right!

490
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,493
A piece of wood was

491
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,195
used to Kill the chief!

492
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,798
You are a very careless man.

493
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:29,800
You hid the piece of wood

494
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,103
that's smaller than-your wood chocolate
in your kitchen beforehand.

496
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,142
And then, you brought
the wood chocolate to Conan,

498
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,378
with the piece of wood hidden
under the tray.

500
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:45,316
You hit the back of the victim:s head,
with it.

502
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,986
Show Me the evidence If you say so!

503
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:49,720
The evidence

504
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,290
Iies in Mr. Fujino's corner over there.

505
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,024
Conan,

506
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,791

for me, please?

509
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:57,695

00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,101
Let me help you

I can't cut it.

522
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,195
What is it?

523
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,864
There a real piece of wood in the cake...

524
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:34,999
Hmmmm!?

525
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,271
Fujino hid the murder weapon in the cake

526
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,106
put it on this trays

527
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,257

529
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,511
He took the! real wooden chocolate

530
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,913
and 'went-outside

531
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,687
Chief was literally like a witch
that's on the wall of this candy house. >

533
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,057
She promised me to give me my own store

534
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,126
if I win a contest and
work with her for three years

536
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,695
So I wen a contest
with my wood-chocolate

538
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,664
and worked. for three 'years

539
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:08,916
I never complained at all

540
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,334
even fl had to-work like a bee.

542
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,903
as 'soon as "became popular.

543
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,671
Hashigaki took back
what she:said-before.

545
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,373
Sheevenswent as far as to say

546
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,508
sheswouldrtake the wood chocolate
away.fromime

548
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:18,826
Finally

549
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,279
sheisaid.there was no promise
made between us at all!

554
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:24,615
I, I just...

556
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,586
