Well, I've heard a lot about you

59
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,661

00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:04,362
I'm really honored...

61
00:05:04,363 --> 00:05:08,333

may be the cause of this incident...

63
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:08,867
Huh!

64
00:05:09,302 --> 00:05:10,402

65
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:12,971
es, u..we...

66
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,873
I didn't think that something
Iike this was going to happen...

68
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:19,144
Well, its reallyia great help
that you're here Mr. Mouri.

70
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:20,679
We're:counting=on you.

71
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:23,148
Oh, uh, I hope I can be of help...

73
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:27,352
I guess you can leave things to me,
since I'm here anyway.

75
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:30,254
6y...

76
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:33,158
And. have you identified the victim?

77
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:34,426
Yes,

78
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:36,895
he is Keisuke Furuta age 42.

79
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:39,030
He is an office worker who lives nearby

80
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:41,483
He seems to always
come home on this train,

82
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:43,635
and it seems that he was on
his way back home today too.

84
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:47,406
The cause of his death is due to a fractured
skull from a violent blow to his head

86
00:05:47,774 --> 00:05:52,060
He got into a fight... with this person here
Mr. Hideki Sugimoto age 27.

88
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:55,013
He works at a company
in the city of Tokyo.

00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:57,649
I am Goto from
the West Sumita police station.

92
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,052
Will you please explain
what just happened...

94
00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:03,754
Hmm~~~ it's kind of noisy here...

95
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,626
You may use the break room
for station employees if you like...

97
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,127
Mr. Noriwaki!

98
00:06:09,562 --> 00:06:10,128

00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:11,329

100
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:13,432
Oh, that would be a great help.

101
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:19,538
What is»... thisswound he has here...?

102
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,912
I went to an after-hours
business contact meeting tonight,

104
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:28,647
and I was on my way back home...

105
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:34,119
I suddenly had to-go to the restroom .and

106
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:36,521
put my knapsack-on the. net shelf,

107
00:06:36,923 --> 00:06:38,290
then headed for the restroom.

108
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:46,631
Myistomach was feeling queasy
soil stayed inside. for some time.

110
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,266
And came out.

111
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,469
My knapsack was gone!

112
00:06:50,837 --> 00:06:52,637
Oh!... And?

113
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:55,740
Then? I happened to look out
it the platform and...

115
00:06:55,942 --> 00:06:58,443
saw him with my knapsack!!

116
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:00,111
H-Hold it!!

117
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:02,547
What do you think you're doing...
That's my knapsack!

119
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,115
Just what do you think you're doing?!

120
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,117
W-What's with you?!...

121
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:10,088
He wouldn't give my knapsack back to me.

122
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:12,390
So you got into a fight...

123
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:13,792
Yes...

124
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,194
and when I tried to bet
ck... apsack ba my kn

126
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:18,663
the strap cut off and...

127
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:24,152
Whaaaa

128
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:32,277
Unluckily the under construction
fence wasn't there...

130
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:37,382
Which means you
haven't met Mr. Furuta before?

132
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:39,951
N-No...

133
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:41,186
I haven't!

134
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,557
What do you think, Mr Mourn...

135
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:48,360
el sorry for him...

136
00:07:48,661 --> 00:07:50,996
Mr. Furuta wouldn't have
gone through what he did

138
00:07:50,997 --> 00:07:55,634
if he didn't take Mr. Sugimoto's
knapsack in the first place...

140
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:58,803
U... Uh...

141
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:03,341
I wonder if Mr. Furuta was really
trying to steal Mr. Sugimoto's bag?

143
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:05,744
What do you mean?

144
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,880
Maybe he thought that
somebody had forgotten it?

146
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:11,149
F-Forgotten?!...

147
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,350
YES.

148
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:16,354
He has delivered forgotten goods
to us several times in the past too...

150
00:08:16,856 --> 00:08:19,691
I Among all of us we thought that
he was a nice person, a rare breed,

152
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:22,460
a rare breed, not too easily found in
Iately. He doesn't seem like the type

154
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:26,231
who would steal something that
someone else had forgotten.

156
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:27,365
Are you serious?

157
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,567
Definitely!

158
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,103
Mr Mouri

159
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:33,104
Hmm...

160
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:36,441
If it's really as you say,

161
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:40,779
he may have confirmed the owner
of the bag before he got off the train...

163
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,315
Go and question the passengers
on the double!

166
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:44,849
Yes sir!

167
00:08:46,352 --> 00:08:48,385
Inspector...

168
00:08:48,955 --> 00:08:51,590
Please calm down, Mr. Sugimoto.

169
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:54,058
Anyways, we'll just wait till
an eyewitness testimony comes out.

171
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:56,260
Y-yes, sir...

173
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:04,769
It's just as the Station employee had said...

174
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:06,938
Mr. Furuta seems to have confirmed

175
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:09,808
whether the owner was around
before cettin off the train.

178
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,577
R-Really?

179
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:13,311
Yes.

180
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:17,115
There was a passenger
who remembered you, Mr. Sugimoto,

182
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,584
when you stood to go
to the restroom, and

184
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:21,385
also saw that Mr. Furuta
came on the train after you.

186
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:23,021
In other words...

187
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:26,224
Mr. Sugimoto went to the restroom
Ieaving his knapsack on the net shelf.

189
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:29,260
Then Mr. Furuta who boarded the train later,

190
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:32,597
took the knapsack to be a forgotten item,
took it and got off the train...

192
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,600
mm Mr. Sugimoto who had gone
to the restroom; thought

194
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:37,736
that his knapsack was:being stolen.

195
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:41,873
Found Mr. Furuta among the passengers
who had gotten off the train

197
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,508
and tried to get it back.

198
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:48,380
Mr. Furuta thought that
e confirmed the owner,

200
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:50,981
so when he was told to
Give the knapsack back

202
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:52,417
he couldn't believe it off the bat...

203
00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:55,387
Mr. Furuta was also probably
a ven righteous man.

205
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:58,923
He probably got into a fight trying to keep
the knapsack from being taken away...

207
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:00,925
I guess this Is a tragedy...

208
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:03,128
That was born from misunderstanding

209
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:04,829
O-Oh no...

210
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,799
You're to blame too.
You know, Mr. Sugimoto!

212
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:12,070
You didn't have to jump on him
so aggressively as you did too...

214
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:14,472
I lost my temper...

215
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,942
He goes out of his way to deliver
a forgotten item and dies,

217
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:21,012
poor guy...

218
00:10:22,782 --> 00:10:25,550
You can have this back.

219
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:35,293
It.It's gone!

220
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:37,829
What seems to be the matter?

221
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:40,031
The receipt is gone!

222
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:41,366
Receipt?

223
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,968
The receipt of the store
I went to with my client.

225
00:10:44,003 --> 00:10:46,838
I had it-in here with the change!

226
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:49,307
Both are gone

227
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:53,144
Maybe you put it in
your pocket or something?

229
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,714
No. I'm positive I put it in the wallet.

230
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:57,582
Give me a break...

231
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,919
Maybe it fell on the platform when
ou were stru in with each others...

234
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,153
Officer Saito!

235
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:03,922
I'll go check!

236
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:11,096
How was it?

237
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:12,464
Well,

238
00:11:12,698 --> 00:11:15,332
there, was nothing of
that sort on the platform...

240
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:16,801
ut... Inspector!

241
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,904
I brought Mr. Furuta's belongings...

242
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:24,175
Japanese Restaurant Sasayama? )

243
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:27,077
Inspector.

244
00:11:27,113 --> 00:11:29,781
Could you show me that?

245
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:34,519
Excuse me.

246
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:36,254
Just as I thought!

247
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:39,157
This is the receipt I was looking for!

248
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,024
See.

249
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:41,726
Mr. Hideki Sugimoto.

250
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,394
The price was for the food was

251
00:11:43,696 --> 00:11:45,463
25000 yen.

253
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:50,368
ut, why was it in Mr. Furuta's pocket?

254
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:54,272
I can't figure it out.

255
00:11:56,242 --> 00:11:58,176
U-Uh... the thing is...

256
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:01,479
It was just once in the past...

257
00:12:01,914 --> 00:12:04,481
But. there was a time that money
was taken from the forgotten item

259
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:07,685
that Mr. Furuta had turned in.

260
00:12:07,987 --> 00:12:09,154
AN -»
What?!

262
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:10,722
Back then...

263
00:12:10,723 --> 00:12:12,690
Mr. Furuta was suspected too...

264
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:14,692
But. he was deemed innocent

265
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,295
after we decided that the thief wouldn't
go turn in a stolen item...

267
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,832
see, so that's the story.

268
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:26,638
Mr. Furuta probably had
a habit of stealing money

270
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,073
from the forgotten items he turned in.

271
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:31,442
A habitual thief?

272
00:12:31,744 --> 00:12:34,145
That's why he
couldn't return the knapsack.

274
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:34,979
Because if he did.

275
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,615
The fact that he stole the money
would be revealed on the spot...

277
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,685
Iv 1) [Al
1a SS es ory...

279
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:44,522
Mr. Furuta would never
do something like that...

281
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:46,424
It's very difficult to believe...

282
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:48,760
Mr. Sugimoto!

283
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:50,061
Oh... yes!

284
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:51,496
Just to be safe.

285
00:12:51,497 --> 00:12:54,666
Will you check to see
if anything else had been stolen?

287
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:56,201
Y-Yes, sir.

288
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:09,880
Everything else is here

289
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:11,115
I see...

290
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:15,587
Please fill in this form then.

291
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:16,588
Yes...

294
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,695
Oh. could you please lend me a pen?

295
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:25,597
Oh, excuse me...

296
00:13:25,664 --> 00:13:27,231
for not noticing it...

297
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:28,399
Here you are.

298
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:30,534
Oh. thank you...

299
00:13:50,222 --> 00:13:51,489
You jerk!!

300
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:56,827
It's just as I thought...

301
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:11,075
I see, that's the story...

302
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:13,244
I figured out

303
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:17,582
the real truth hidden behind this accident...

304
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:26,357
Ghads...
what kind of important talk could there-be...

306
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,561
And, where'd Conan go off to...

307
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:32,964
after calling me out like this...

308
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:44,509
Pops

309
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,311
you can leave the rest to me...

310
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,281
Okay... this will be fine

311
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:54,218
Inspector Goto!

312
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:56,154
What's the matter?

313
00:14:56,488 --> 00:15:00,191
Mr. Mouri wants all of us
to come to the platform

315
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:02,493
To the platform...

316
00:15:04,463 --> 00:15:06,664
What on earth is itr. Mourn?

317
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,667
Look at the pose?!

318
00:15:10,102 --> 00:15:11,769
The rumored

319
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,271
Sleeping Kogoro?!

320
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,708
But Inspector...

321
00:15:17,993 --> 00:15:19,377
Agh... Mr. Mouri,

322
00:15:19,478 --> 00:15:20,678
this case was solved already as

323
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:24,215
being an accident that happened from
a man trying to get back his knapsack...

325
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:27,318
That's not the story; though,
Inspector Goto!

327
00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:28,286
What?!

328
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:30,722
Just what do you mean?!

329
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:33,291
I'll explain that in a minute.

330
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:38,997
First of all, will all of you try to
recall Mr. Sugimotds testimony.

332
00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:41,466
It's true that Mr. Sugimoto returned
after going to the restroom and

334
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:44,602
realized that his knapsack was gone.

335
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:46,437
He sees Mr. Furuta on the platform

336
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:48,639
and rushes off the train...

337
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:50,375
That's right, isn't it...

338
00:15:50,476 --> 00:15:52,377
Yes. right!

339
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:56,547
But the Mr. Sugimoto that we saw

340
00:15:56,548 --> 00:15:59,951
came dashing out from
near the vending machine.

342
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:02,553
And. is there anything strange about it?...

343
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:05,289
Don't you think it's strange?

344
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:08,559
If Mr. Sugimoto jumped off
the train from the front.

346
00:16:08,694 --> 00:16:10,928
Why would he be in a place like that?

347
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:16,000
He would've ran there from
an absolutely different. direction...

349
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:18,870
Agh?! I see.

350
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:20,738
Ome to think of it, yes...

351
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,308
It's unnatural that he was by
the vending machine over there...

353
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,246
ut. why did Mr. Sugimoto do that...?

354
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,481
He was waiting.

355
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,551
For Mr. Furuta to take the money out!

356
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:34,318
What?!

357
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,120
What?!

358
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,289
You're only running wild on imagination!!

359
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,391
Mr. Sugimoto probably knew that

360
00:16:40,526 --> 00:16:43,327
Mr. Furuta would take
money out of the wallet

362
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:46,147
pretending to turn the knapsack in.

363
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:48,399
That's why he left the receipt

364
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,769
inside his wallet deliberately
with the money

366
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:54,038
Because if the receipt is found.

367
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:57,008
And the fact that Mr. Furuta stole
the money is revealed. Mr. Sugimoto

369
00:16:57,042 --> 00:17:01,579
aggressively trying to'get his
knapsack back would be justified.

371
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:02,914
T-That's not true!

372
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:04,682
Then?!

373
00:17:04,883 --> 00:17:05,616
Yes,

374
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:09,620
Mr. Sugimoto deliberately put the net shelf

375
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:13,958
and went to the restroom
to make)Mr. Furuta steal the money.

377
00:17:15,594 --> 00:17:18,695
But there were other
passengers on the train...

379
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:22,100
Why did Mr. Furuta think that
the knapsack was a forgotten item?...

381
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:24,302
The cell phone.

382
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:27,171
The cell phone?!...

383
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:29,307
Didnit 'you realize that

384
00:17:29,475 --> 00:17:32,009
there, was a cell phone
inside the knapsack?!...

386
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:33,578
Probably

387
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:36,881
a cell phone with
a history of incoming calls...

389
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:40,651
Mr. Sugimoto. who went to the restroom

390
00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:43,087
just before arriving at West Sumita Station,

391
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:48,025
with his other cell phone and
called theicell phone in the knapsack!

393
00:17:57,836 --> 00:18:00,070
The phone rang. but on one answered it!

394
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:03,040
That's why he thought that
the knapsack was a forgotten item!

396
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:04,442
I see...

397
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:06,844
just as would be expected
of the Sleeping Kogoro.

399
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,679
Mr. Sugimoto quietly watched

400
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,015
while Mr. Furuta hid behind
materials of the construction site

402
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:15,520
and took out the money.

403
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:17,121
He grabbed Mr. Furuta and dragged him

404
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:20,324
and pushed him into the KEEP OUT area.

405
00:18:20,492 --> 00:18:23,361
Then; he pushed him
over with all his might!

407
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:33,371
Of course the rope that held
the fence of the KEEP OUT area

409
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:36,474
in place was cut beforehand.

410
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,810
Then all hé had to do next.

411
00:18:40,811 --> 00:18:44,147
Was pull the knapsack from Mr. Furuta
who was down on the ground.

413
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:47,585
If Mr. Furuta fought back to keep
the knapsack from being taken away

415
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:50,788
the strap which had been slit
in advance would be cut

417
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:53,207
and Mr. Furuta who loses balance

418
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:56,627
would fall off the overpass platform
to the ground below.

420
00:18:56,795 --> 00:18:59,030
The shoulder strap
was slit beforehand?!...

422
00:18:59,031 --> 00:19:01,299
Excuse me, please.

423
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:04,602
In-Inspector?!

424
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:05,636
Yes,

425
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,805
it was not accident!

426
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:11,242
It was a planned murder under
the pretext of an accident!

428
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,512
T-That's absurd!

429
00:19:14,513 --> 00:19:16,280
That's nothing more than a far-fetched story.

430
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,515
Listen!

431
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:21,652
He tried with all his might and
resisted giving me back the knapsack!

433
00:19:21,753 --> 00:19:25,356
How could I have knocked him down,
then pushed him over...

435
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,992
Things don't work out that well!

436
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,493
As a matter of fact it does.

437
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:31,229
Huh 2!

438
00:19:31,763 --> 00:19:36,317
If you use the ballpoint pen that you have
stuck to the inner pocket of your suit!

440
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:39,103
Ballpoint pen...?

441
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,441
You cornered him to behind
the materials and

443
00:19:43,575 --> 00:19:47,310
poked Mr. Furuta with
all your might with that ballpointpen.

445
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:57,121
While Mr. Furuta flinched
from pain,

447
00:19:57,122 --> 00:19:57,722
While Mr. Furuta flinched
from pain,

449
00:19:57,723 --> 00:19:59,290
you pushed him.

450
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:08,214
The mark left by the ballpoint pen was left

451
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,738
plain and clear on the back
of his hand that you poked!!

453
00:20:15,207 --> 00:20:16,307
How about it,

454
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:17,808
Mr. Sugimoto!

455
00:20:33,392 --> 00:20:35,393
Mr. Sugimoto...

457
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:37,928
I couldn't forgive him!!

460
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,199
He took the life of my girlfriend!!

461
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:43,134
Huh

462
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:47,438
6 months ago...

463
00:20:48,173 --> 00:20:53,210
He rammed full speed into my-girlfriend
who was crossing. the crosswalk.

465
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,793
We were going

466
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:10,761
to get married soon...

467
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:15,199
There were no witnesses and

468
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:17,535
Furuta's version insisting that

469
00:21:17,536 --> 00:21:19,704
the pedestrian ran into
the street went through,

471
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:21,806
and he wasn't even prosecuted!

472
00:21:22,507 --> 00:21:26,694
That's much too cruel... ruthless.

473
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:28,195
So. you decided

474
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:30,581
to kill Mr. Furuta

475
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:32,683
under the pretext of an accident...

476
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:34,552
I just couldn't...

477
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,387
I just couldn't make myself

478
00:21:38,156 --> 00:21:40,591
