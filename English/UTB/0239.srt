00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,904
I found more and more evidence

404
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:02,000
whose number is 8, was his killer.

405
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,026
The lights on in the second room.

406
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,606
Since the hotel's not open yet,

407
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,545
where the gun shots came from,

408
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,368
After you knocked on his door,

409
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,376
you spoke into the transceiver,

410
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,579
You should've been able to stop

411
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,722
for scoring goals on free kicks

412
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,759
could also have done it, however

413
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:27,158
to the Osaka Prefecture Police.

414
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,183
But he was;looking forward to

415
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,899
But you canst prove I put it there...

416
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:52,150
I had my agent hang on to for me.

417
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,154
When you shot him, weren't you?

418
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,654
You could also turn the light off,

419
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:42,760
to kick the ball, knock on Ed's door

420
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,025
He could've opened the curtains

421
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,608
Everything he wrote was a lie

422
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,595
What are YOU talking about!

423
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,669
A mop in a hotel's'guest room?

424
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,917
These stairs to get to each floor...

425
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,400
Ieft the field, never t Nréturn again...

426
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,933
If Conan's anything like Shinichi,

427
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,772
and the sliding door is lifted up,

428
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:42,760
then kicked the ball, didn't you?

429
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,312
ELLEN S SL ELTH

430
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,843
but the evidence you mentioned,

431
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:52,611
which turned the light on in the room

432
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,062
Escort on the Shinkansen" Part I

433
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,430
Like the newspaper article said,

434
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,734
and professional soccer player

435
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:42,260
to kick the ball, knock on Ed's door

436
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:46,698
then kicked the ball, didn't yéu?

437
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,997
And is undergoing rehabilitation.

438
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:09,320
"Don't know what everybody»

439
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:52,738
the same time he opened the door.

440
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,421
Ray's not going to be playing?!

441
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:30,468
Whom I loved more than anything...

442
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,620
IMS Entertainment, Ltd.

443
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,624
When they go into withdrawal.

444
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,096
So when'd you figure it out, boy...

445
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,730
Goal keeper, uniform number 8...

446
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,238
and told her that you were heading

447
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,757
and by the time the victim let them in,

448
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,997
Mike's injured his Achilles tendon

449
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:39,992
The 3K's Incident in Osaka" Part ll

450
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:42,760
You probably knocked on the door

451
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,811
The person who is working there

452
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,132
your so called super plays were...

453
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:40,879
closest to the scene of the murder

454
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,957
turning the light off on the fifth floor

455
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:46,698
You probably knocked on the door

456
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:31,009
the toilet holding-your right knee

457
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,747
Any other time, if the witnesses to

458
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,715
You washed your face and hands,

459
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:41,259
other great players in that game...

460
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,731
The sliding door is.proppediup

461
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,588
because they can't stand the pain

462
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,702
Have I missed something? ..Ray...

463
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,813
Are yousserious, did he really say

464
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,630
the scene of the murder was on the

465
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,683
your plan went something like this...

466
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,825
of the sleeve and maybe the pants.

467
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,841
After you turned on the first light,

468
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,519
It would've been impossible for me

469
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,519
It would've been impossible for me

470
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,833
I set off to prove you were innocent

471
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,918
I should, have powder residue on me.

472
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:27,606
The same goes for Mike who was

473
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:38,324
I know it had something to do with

474
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:18,255
went into the toilet right after you

475
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,569
Katsuyoshi Kobdyshi

476
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,883
the room Ed was waiting in, shot him

477
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,500
turned your shirt and pants inside out

478
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:01,606
I started using drugs AFTER that...

479
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,016
but it would have taken 10 seconds

480
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:20,106
[4But while we were in the midst of

481
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:05,484
they're probably sticking close to

482
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:32,438
The tip of the mop handle is placed in

483
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:13,518
deflate the ball and hide it in your shirt

484
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:16,722
First, you leave the door wide open

485
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,576
A prisoner's being transported!

486
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,944
What's this deflated{soccer ball

487
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,771
through the most mysterious case.

488
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,397
Then...to forget the grief I. felt over,

489
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:18,255
came out and found it in the trash bin.

490
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,469
I heard it in some restaurant once...

491
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:09,227
If I'm arrested, my fans and my family

492
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,617
but if he used what he always does,

493
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:58,770
I I OKs like something happened!

494
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,177
The elevators weren't operating...

495
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,728
All the rooms are set up the same and

496
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,041
Conan's disappointing suspect...

497
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,929
the murderer will be caught in no time!

498
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,632
I believe that would be solid proof...

499
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:20,106
helping them with their secret plan,

500
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:40,879
Out of the three, Ray was in the room

501
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,548
This shirt as well as these pants,

502
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,550
you'd had hidden and the soccer ball

503
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,727
or a sukiyaki restaurant. one of those.

504
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:18,016
Even a kid like me managed to do it...

505
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,569
EU 'RDING DIRECTOR.

506
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,722
It would take:more than 3 seconds

507
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,506
This is the time to solve the incident.

508
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,128
000 B LulAngeles/San Diegé

509
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,962
You set this up in the room 'scheduled

510
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:42,508
and at almostithe same time, kill the

511
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:05,484
Inspetor Otaki helping with the case...

512
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,277
Take the soccer ball you've prepared

513
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,707
and while you were waiting in the room,

514
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:20,332
gun powder residue on them, did you?

515
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,481
Barely three seconds had passed

516
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,953
attend a restaurant's opening party.

517
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:21,794
Then remove the closet's sliding door

518
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,767
It wouldn't have been possible for him

519
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,728
the lights switches are all in this spot.

520
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,132
In the position the light switch will be

521
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:40,679
his right hand is in a sushi eating form

522
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,946
who could have committed the murder!

523
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,703
That string had been tied to the curtain

524
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:39,598
knowing Ran was outside watching,

525
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:06,058
and ran back down.stairs into the room,

526
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:53,439
you got yours before this happened!

527
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,887
I guess you knew gun powder residue

528
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:50,389
a chronic articular ailment in his left knee.

529
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:03,342
Lights on and off is to press the switch...

530
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:29,955
Then turned on the lights on in the third,

531
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,813
that means there was-an extra one...

532
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:13,518
Isn't that when you used this needle to

533
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,026
Of course, you deliberately didn't turn}

534
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,320
Detective? Can we leave already?

535
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:27,606
Opening the curtains on the third floor...

536
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:57,208
he'll do a complete turnaround and hate

537
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,677
I'm asking you to turn yourself in, Ray...

538
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:54,266
that the wiring was rigged in any way...

539
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:16,722
until the door to the hotel room is locked

540
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,233
so that I have an excuse for the police...

541
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:52,611
then you kicked the ball down the stairs

542
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,148
The other two might not be able to do it

543
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,957
which means Ricardo. who said he was

544
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,376
confirmed the light had been turned out

545
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:17,222
is where my wife was born and raised...

546
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,519
to do what you said in such a:short time.

547
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:10,963
Major League pitcher, Mike Norwood,

548
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:32,438
between the sliding door and the switch,

549
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,648
we found that an American newspaper

550
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,163
in the room you were just in at the hotel

551
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:03,342
And it seems like the only way to turn the

552
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,957
go back to the hotel and take 'a shower!

553
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,727
A tempura restaurant, a sushi restaurant

554
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,537
None of the three could have committed

555
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:36,168
with this method, you cangturn the lights

556
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,659
that would take another five seconds...

557
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,731
in the position the lightiswitch: will be

558
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:14,065
O Gosho Aoyamn / Shogakukan * YTV *= TMS

559
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,630
second floor, which you were in charge of.

560
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:49,688
In sushi restaurants, the employees use

561
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:17,222
and lured him here to Japan because this

562
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:22,868
After all, Heija Hattori's hot on the case!

563
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,064
Thanks to this murder, the party's ruined.

564
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,519
To do what you said in suchta;short time.

565
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,813
He wasn't goingito-the game in Nagai?

566
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,747
A crime had shaky alibis like these guys.

567
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,098
SO youican hide it just about anywhere...

568
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,009
He sees through the one and only truth.

569
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:45,056
They look like real brothers, don't they?

570
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,787
Even if they could've made it to the room,

571
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:52,738
you went to the stairs and kicked the ball

572
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,121
If he tied string to the edge of the curtain

573
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:49,688
a code of symbols only they understand.

574
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,388
The lights you were supposed to turn on,

575
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,962
by the gun shot giving us the impression, ,

576
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:06,978
but it caused my wife to commit suicide

577
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:49,435
The lottery for the autographed souvenirs

578
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,119
during your career-assa mid-fielder, you,

579
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,293
fig Beach/Los Angeles/Qfii DIQD

580
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,933
we'vergot¥a lot to worry about:though...

581
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,894
