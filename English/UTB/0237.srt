00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,202
Even destiny serves
as a clue to deduction

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,638
and the light of truth pierces
through the most mysterious case.

5
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,607
This is the first time Conan is handling
a case like this.

7
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,842
XWere you able to enjoy his facial
expressions as well as his deductions?

9
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,410

12
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,248
no case is left
unsolved with Detective Conan.

14
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,351
We set off on a trip to Whitevsandeeach
in Wakayama prefecture.

16
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,054
Despite having a feeling
that somebody was watching us,

18
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,023
we continued sightseeing .

19
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,259
Later

20
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,161
we find out that one of the five
Naniwa University students

22
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,963
that we met the prevnous day,

23
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,433
Mam Sh'mm was found dead
at Sandanbekl.

25
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:18,170
Among her belongings,

26
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,138
her wallet and her car key are missing.

27
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,509
In the pocket of her top,

28
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,477
she has working gloves.

29
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:26,946
Also,

30
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,180
what is the meaning of the tiny bottle

31
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,586
and the Sour Boy easel?

32
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,956
What looks to be murder-robbery
is firobably camouflage...!

34
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,760
Possibilities of this being a murder
committed by an acquaintance is high.

36
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,094
If so

37
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,997
the murderer is among the people here!

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,974
Okay everyone,

41
00:02:55,508 --> 00:03:00,846
please tell us where and what you were
doing from 10:26 in the morning to 11:00.

43
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,948
Just what do you mean by that!

44
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,350
Do you suspect us?

45
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,053
No, we're just verifying things...!

46
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,622
I was sketching at White Sand Beach...
TatsumkUYUra

48
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,559
Since there were a lot of tourists,

49
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,295
it shouldn't be hard to verify.

50
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,197
In your case, Ms. MItSUI...

51
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,067
since you were so near
the scene of the crime,

53
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,735
your alibi may not help you much.

54
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,104
But we do there sketching right through?

56
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,405
IUD.

57
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,440
Any witnesses?

58
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:28,974
I'U...

59
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,275
I don't like to be watched
what I'm sketching...

61
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,845
I don't like to be watched
what I'm sketching...

68
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,016
that's why I had them show me a place
where there were not too many people.

70
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,317
Who told you of this place?

71
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:39,985
Makl did.

72
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,955
She seems to have come to
White Sand Beach many times,

74
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:43,789
so she knew this place very well.

75
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,625
Uh, Ms. Mihara.

76
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,563
I was a restaurant near Engetsu island...

77
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,698
from about 10:30 to 12:00.

78
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:57,369
Oh, the parking lot where a woman was
standing calling out to the customers.

80
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,405
The shop where Engetsu Island
is in view, right?

82
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,107
Yes, that's right .

83
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,610
At first, I was sketching in the vacant lot
where Marine Palace used to be...

85
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,346
Right inside the tunnel
from the Memorial hall.

87
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,481
A funnel?

88
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,785
Back there,. eh...

89
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,087
Maki was the one who told you about

90
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,522
the vacant lot wh'arejMa'rine Palace
used to be too, right?

92
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:17,857
LRight...

93
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,492
Because I didn't want to be bothered

94
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,294
But somehow I didn't feel like drawing,

95
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,362
so I went to drink a cup of coffee
to refresh myself

97
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:25,463
and ended up eating lunch there...

99
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,934
draw much did you?

100
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,970
Nope, not at all.

101
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,239
I was sketching at the beach
from afternoon.

103
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,042
You mean the one on the way
to the Memorial hall?

105
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:41,614
But from there you can only get
a side view of Engetsu lslahd, can'; you?

107
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,216
Why didn't you sketch
mom the mo \ . area

109
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,684
where you could get
a frontal view of Engetsu Island?

111
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,721
I didn't want to draw anything
that resembled picture postcards.

113
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,189
That's what art is all about!

114
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,092
Don't ask such silly questions

115
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,293
By the way, Ms. Mihara,

116
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,296
we found in
Ms. Maki Shinjo's caller ID records

118
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,198
that you were the last person
to have called her.

120
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,634
Yes, I called her,

121
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,201
wondering how she was...

122
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,138
But, since she didn't answer, I hung up.

123
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,874
And now, Mr Pu.

124
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,011
I was at Adventure World...

125
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,482
from 10:26 to about 11:00...

126
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,817
I think I was watching the Marine show.

127
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,686
Do you have any witnesses?

128
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,490
I didn't run into anyone,

129
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,458
but I took a picture
using my digital camera.

131
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,227
Would you like me to connect it
to the TV set?

133
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,161
What?

134
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,897
You mean you can do something like
that with a digital camera?

136
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,639
This is the picture
that Maki sent me this morning.

138
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,609
She sent it first to Kanako, Yura
and-Madoka, then me, in that order.

140
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,011
She sent it first to Kanako, Yura
and Madoka, then me, in that order.

142
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,580
After this,

143
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:50,149
I took several more pictures
inside Adventure World...

145
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,954
Then I watched the seal, dolphin, and
Orca shows that were 30 minutes each.

147
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,989
Oh, see, from here.

148
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,597
It's the show that we saw, isn't it?

149
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,064
Yep!

150
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,933
We saw the one from 11-00.

151
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,970
Then, we just missed each other.

152
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,941
Huh...?
Ooops, that's it!

154
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:22,448
But, could there be a possibility that
he took the next Orca and Dolphin show?

156
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,782
Just what do you mean by that?

157
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,220
In other words, if he takes a picture of
the seal show from 9:30 to 10:00,

159
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,624
and then"'takes
the next dolphin show from 11:30,

161
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,027
it would serve as his alibu
from 10:00 to 11:30.

163
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,362
I see!

164
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,596
I don't think so.

165
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,364
What?!

166
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,699
I think that's an Interesting deduction,

167
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,769
but she's not the same woman we saw.

168
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,239
Oh, you're right.

169
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,608
The person we saw had braids.

170
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:53,078
Which means that
Mr. Fuji has a perfect alibl

172
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,915
But why didn't you take Ia picture of
the Cree Shbw untilm 3:1 5

174
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,185
after taking theaOncéerhow before 11 :00'?

175
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:05,891
The next picture is the one that you took
when you saw us at 1315, isn't it?

177
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:09,228
Dlsn'ta-strange
that you didn't take any pictures

179
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,195
for a period of
more than 2 hours and 15 minutes?

181
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:14,600
T,That's because I was riding
Jet coasters, having meals

183
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,635
besides I had nothing
that I wanted to take during that time!

185
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,638
I tell you, cut out your stupid questions!

186
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,110
Please let me copy your pictures
on your driver's license

188
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,746
so I can go verify what you just testified.

189
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,382
I'm pretty sure...

190
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,951
that my intuition is correct...

191
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,454
If so,

192
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,323
what with the pictures
taken by the digital camera. '?

194
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:39,325
Wait a sec...

195
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,860
A laptop...?

196
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,196
Maybe...

197
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,232
May I go outside for a while?

198
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,235
Okay, but keep away
from dangerous places.

200
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:50,836
Okay.

201
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,949
Nun-l...n:,

202
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,518
Adventure World
'7-Jbl~

204
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:10,723
Um, I left just a while ago,
but may I go back in again?

206
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,491
My father is inside.

207
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:13,959
Okay,

208
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,295
I guess-you didn't get your hand stamped
when you went out

210
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,096
What?!

211
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,131
A stamp...?

213
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,102
Okay,

214
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,737
I got a hold of one evidence!

215
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,174
What?! Down with a fever?

216
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,109
RI ht,

217
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,344
that's why we're so busy.

218
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:35,247
Justaslthoughtu!

219
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,188
Why did Maki go to Sandanbekl
where Madoka was

221
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,324
after she saw us at Shirahama Station?

222
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,027
Moreoven the greatest mystery yet is

223
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,497
that I still can-it figure out
who kill'éd Makl...!

225
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,867
Just one more timé!I;Oneef'mOne? time!

226
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,969
Please let me ride
the Adventure Coaster, okay!!

228
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,771
My goodnessh:

229
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,606
Will you promise to study
when we" get home?

231
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,241
I will I will I promise

232
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,042
Okay then, just one m'oiez'time!

233
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,911
All right

234
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,251
That boy's not going to study for beans...!

235
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,994
Hsee,

236
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,295
so that's what happened.

237
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,931
Ifso,

238
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,366
everything's been solved...!

239
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:30,302
No doubt about it...!

240
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,871
That person's the killer!

242
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:39,044
I'm sure that person's the killer,
but I have no proof...!

244
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,313
Oh, goodness!

245
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:41,747
Hmm...

246
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,584
Today is r'eally'hot,
and it's -a'l'tea'dy1thi's4time of day!

248
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,392
I see...

249
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,760
This was a blind spot for men!)

250
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,197
I've found conclusive evidence

251
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,667
Hey, aren't you the boy
staying with Mr Mourl'?

253
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,268
Oh, officer.

254
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,369
Why are you here?

255
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:07,706
Did you come to verify
the time_o,f the=Marine-Show too?

257
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,707
Yeah just to be sure...

258
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:14,680
Mr. Mouri was saying that he wa'nte'dyou
to check on something elser-loo.

260
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:15,948
What?!

261
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,015
Mr Mouri said so...?

262
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,591
First of all, Mr. Yura

263
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:29,528
was witnessed sketching right
through from about 09:00 to after 11:00

265
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,431
by the life guard who was
on duty at the beach park.

267
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:36,301
Next, as for Ms. Mihara,

268
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,971
we were able to get testimony
from the people at the restaurant.

270
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,175
The problem is you, Mr. Fuji

271
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,176
What?!

272
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,246
We questioned the Cree trainer
and found out

274
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:50,282
that the same members have been
on duty all day today.

276
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,219
Nevertheless, a person
that was not even there today

278
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,954
was taken on your digital camera!

279
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,723
Well, that's because.

280
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:58,991
Mr. Fuji.

281
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,726
You left Adventure World once,
didn't you?

283
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,097
No use lying about it,

284
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,332
because all we have to do is use
this black light to disclose that you did!

286
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,168
What is that?

287
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,837
Come on, Mr. Mourn,

288
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,171
Iet's cut out that horse play

289
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,973
You're the one who told us to check on it.

290
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:15,674
Huh?!

291
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:16,775
Please go ahead

292
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:19,411
Please show me your right hand.

293
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,415
Some letters have appeared?!

294
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:24,850
Mr. Fuji,

295
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:30,154
the mark is stamped on your hand
for those who want to re-enter

297
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:32,356
when you leave
Adventure World temporarily.

299
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,092
I'm sorry...

300
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,896
The pictures I just showed you were the
edited version of the ones that I had taken

302
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,464
when I came to Adventure World before.

303
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:40,332
I edited them with my laptop

304
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,768
Oh, and just why did you do
something like that...?

306
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,536
W'el la.

307
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,942
You're going steady
with Madoka, right, Mr Fuji?!

309
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:50,475
What'?«!&

310
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,180
What a thing to say, Conan?!
Madoka is...

312
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:55,714
What a thing to say, Conan?!
Madoka is...
Mr Fuji

315
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,351
you left Adventure World about 09:50

316
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:02,287
to see Madoka
who was at Sandanbeki, didn't you

318
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,290
And you stopped over
at Shirahama Station on the way, right?

320
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:06,692
Uh,sonny,

322
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,494
Why would he go frorfi Adventure World
to Shirahama Station

326
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,598
that is in the opposite direction
from Sandanbeh...

328
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,435
He went to buy the key holder
that Madoka wanted.

330
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,837
See, the one that is on that bag.

331
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,606
Sour Boy that is only sold
at the shop at the station...

333
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,811
That's when you saw Mam,
fight, Mr Fun?

335
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,212
What's why...

336
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,183
I was really surprised back then...

337
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:38,056
I didn't think I would run into her
in the place like that...

339
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:40,425
Makl!

340
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,729
Thanks again

341
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,864
To top things off,
I run into all of you too, Mr. Mourn...

343
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:53,338
I didn't want anybody to find out
that I was going with Madoka...

345
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,340
Especially when it came to
Man and Yura...

347
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,442
I knew!

348
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,043
What?!

349
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:01,146
That's why I went to see Madoka
part way too.

351
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,180
What?!

352
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,618
I got to Sandanbeki a little before 12:00...

353
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:07,919
But,

354
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,553
you weren't there,

355
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,556
and that key holder was hanging
from the easel .

357
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:15,027
We were having lunch then.

358
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,130
I sensed right away
that you were with Fujn.

360
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,731
That's Whyfyou threw down
the bottle with sand in it, right?

362
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:21,533
Huh?

363
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,103
The sand of White Sand Beach?

364
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,039
You got it for me .?

365
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,841
Because I sand
that I wanted to take it home?

367
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:32,844
So, you found it eh sonny...

368
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,447
Cracked jUSt Ilke my broken heart...

369
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,553
Why 'did you keep something
so important hidden?!

371
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,255
Well, let's calm down
a bit here, Mr Mourl...

373
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,757
Which means you took
those pictures with your digital camera

375
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,825
just so that you could show your friends

376
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,659
that you had an alibi of
no elng wn a o a -

379
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,229
Yes, almost as if I were playing a game...

380
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,565
I'm really sorry.

381
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,201
But, how'd you figure it out, Conan?

382
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,570
How'd you find out
that I was gonng with her?

384
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,673
Because you were the very first person
that Madoka called

386
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,042
to report what had happened to Man

387
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:07,379
when it would've been more natural for
her to call Mr Yura, right?

389
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,950
Besides, when we got to Sandanbekl,

390
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,253
you knew where Madoka was sketching.

391
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,990
That's why I thought
maybe you had already seen her today.

393
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,025
Oh, I see...

394
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:20,826
No!!

395
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:21,126
Huh?

396
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:26,164
Mam happened to see you
together with Madoka...

398
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,234
so in order to contain the secret

399
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,803
you decided to shut her up!

400
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,806
Southern White Sand Beach

401
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,144
Hmm'?!

402
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,445
What seems to be the matter, Mr Mourl?

403
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,813
Agh! Don't tell me that...!

404
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,682
This is the much rumored about,

405
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,183
Sleeping Kogoro pose!

406
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,952
Now,

407
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,322
Mr. Fuji has absolutely nothing to do
with the incident that had happened.

409
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:50,989
What?

410
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,224
He's not involved?!

411
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,559
The main point of this case is

412
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,963
that there was a switch of
the main characters part way.

414
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,165
The victim of the murder

415
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,000
Which was supposed to have be'e'h
Madoka had also switched to Makl!

417
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,004
Let me explain...

418
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,405
First of all»

419
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,676
Mam, who was angrycat Madoka
3 mg , . er overaaway,

421
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,312
hated her and schemed to kill her

422
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,381
Maki was scheming to kill me ?

423
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:21,052
And, she chose Sandanbekn
as the place to carry out her plan.

425
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:22,687
However,

426
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,023
since Maki had a motive to kill,

427
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,692
she decuded to make herself an allbl.

428
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,796
She let that person pretend to be her

429
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:34,432
and made her do something that caught
the eyes of people at Shirahama Station.

431
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,803
D,Does that mean
she had an accomplice?!

433
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:38,904
Right

434
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,674
Maki who ran into us
at Sh'irahama Station

436
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:46,478
thought of setting up us as wntnesses.

437
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,715
That's why
Maki asked us for our schedule.

439
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,220
She set it up so that we would arrive
at Shirahama Station at 10:00 today.

441
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:01,726
However,
Maki's accomplice had other plans.

443
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:03,295
Other plans ?!

444
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,998
That plan was to switch Maki's alibl

445
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,168
and kill her!

446
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,139
Wait, dad!

447
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,410
Then the Maki that we'saw
at Shirahama Station at about 10:10 was...

449
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,812
Yeah, an ir'fiposter!

450
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,382
The imposter wore a wig, hat,
sunglasses and even make-up

452
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,785
jUSt like Maki's...!

453
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:34,926
And this imposter had probably already
killed Maki at around 09:25 at Sandanbekl

455
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,263
before coming to Shirahama Station!

456
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,633
Whaaaat?
35 minutes before we met her...?

458
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,870
W,Who is that imposter anyway,
Mr. Mourn'?

460
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,539
A person who was trusted enough

461
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,941
to be asked to be an accomplice
in committing the murder...

463
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,611
as well as disguise herself
to look just like Makl.

465
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,013
There iS'Ohly one'ppe'rsonsamon'g athe four
that is. capable of'fib'ifig-thiS! I

467
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,316
Yes? Ms. Kanako Miyahara!!

468
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,652
Only you could've done it!!

470
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,291
But, Mr Mourl!

471
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,929
Kanako already told Maki yesterday that
she would not listen to Maki anymore!

473
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,233
Mam tom her to say

474
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,703
so that the police wouldn't suspect
h'er safiinfi

476
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,939
that Kanako was only making up an alibi

477
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,675
because she was forced to say
what she did.

479
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:29,481
This mooning, after Makiwdropped
everyone off at their destination,

481
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:33,752
she returned to Engetsu Island,
and made Kanako get into her car.

483
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:40,358
Kanako disguised herself
as Maki as they drove along.

485
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,329
According to Maku's plan,

486
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,332
she was supposed to get off
atuthexinner alley of Sandanbekl

488
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,368
which after, Kanako drives to
Shirahama Station.

490
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,271
Then after her alibi was established,

491
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,808
Makl was supposed to kl Madoka.

492
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,276
I see!

493
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,812
That's why there were working gloves
in Maki Shinjo'si'rj'a'cket

495
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,547
Right!

496
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,582
She was going to use them
when committing the crime!

498
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,084
However,

499
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,054
Maki's plan suddenly shatters to pieces.

500
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,294
After committing the murder,

501
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,030
Kanako took Maki's knife and wallet.

502
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,901
She did this to make it
Iook like a murder-robbery...!

506
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,637
She then speeds along

507
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:27,072
9250

508
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:31,576
and arrived at Shirahama Station
a little before we got there

510
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,646
Then, she observed us

511
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:39,050
and waited for
the right time to appear before us

513
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:40,485
Which means that

514
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,755
when Conan said that he felt
as if he was being watched .

516
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,022
Right!

517
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,458
It was Kanako!

518
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,560
After that you...

519
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:54,566
Made us witness Maki around 10.10

520
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,868
Then you went to Sanjo Shrine, while at
the same flme gem'n'g me of the emdence,

522
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,439
You then abandoned the car
and went-lback» to Engetsu Island:

524
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,807
Please wait!

525
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,143
Do you have any grounds
for saying all of this?

527
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,278
Of course!

528
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,749
Although you mentioned
not wanting be bothered by others,

530
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,551
you went out of your way
to choose a beach

532
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,053
where there were
a lot of tourists and began sketching.

534
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,990
Fearing the estimated time of death
being extended to a later time,

536
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,093
you called Maki on her cell phone to
make Madoka realize as soon as possible

538
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,329
that Maki was lying dead on the ground

539
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,099
That's only forced interpretation!

540
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,069
If you insist that I'm the killer,
show me proof!!

542
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:33,204
If I'm not mistaken,

543
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,875
Mam was us'm make-u that
she ordered «from Paris, wasn't she?

545
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,043
Huh?

546
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,779
You may have been able to get
a hold of the clothes

548
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,081
that Mam wore,
or the bags she carried, in Japan

550
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,983
but, as for the characteristic color lipstick
that she used,

552
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,185
you could find no substitute here!

553
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:55,627
Nd your saliva was foun
on that lipstick.

555
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,431
The saliva of the person
who used it last, you...!

557
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,901
Moreover,

558
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:06,104
Maki's lipstick that
you could not wipe off completely

560
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,704
IS still on your lips...

561
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,009
Under Mr. Mouri's orders,

562
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,011
we have already received
the results of the forensic analysis of

564
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,345
Ms. Maki Shlnjo's lipstick.

565
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:19,317
Would you like me-to explain
in detail on saliva and blood type?

567
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,456
No, thank you...

568
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,559
I am aware of that
amount of medical knowledge too.

570
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,729
When did you figure out
that I was the killer...?

572
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:35,600
It took me quite a while
to put my fingers on you.

574
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:40,004
Only, I did have a hunch
that it was one of you.

576
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,675
But, when I found the key holder
near the deadbbody...

578
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,477
Key holder?

579
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:49,747
Mam had the key of the rent-a-car

580
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,084
attached to the key holder together
with her house keys, didn't she?

582
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:57,922
But the key of the rented car was
missing from that key holder.

584
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,358
That's because Mam...

585
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:02,560
Yes,

586
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:06,231
a robber would've taken
the key holder and all

588
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:11,536
because Maki's key holder was not
the hook type key holder,

590
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,506
but the coil type that is harder
to remove the key from.

592
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,576
80, I'm sure that Mam gave you
the key to the car

594
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,812
after she removed it from the key holder...

595
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,115
You're a great man, Mr. MOUI'I,
Just as expected of you.

597
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,718
I've completely lost...

598
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,255
But, Kanako, why did you ?

600
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,759
Entered the university illegally.

601
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,360
Huh...?!

602
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,829
I asked Maki's father to get me in...

603
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,900
After I got in,

604
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:44,736
Makifthreatene'd to disclose
what happened if I didn't listen to her...

606
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,637
That's Why I kept following
her orders all this time...

I guess we'll be able to get back
to Tokyo by tonight somehow.

654
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:29,173
Yes,

655
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,975
it's goodbye to White Sand Beach too...

656
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,681
I'm so sleepy that I can't stand it...

657
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:39,717
Then, have some of this.

658
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,352
A pickled plum.

664

665
00:23:59,038 --> 00:23:59,937

666
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:03,074

667

668
