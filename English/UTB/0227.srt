a keen sense of rhythm that enables one
to grasp the inner meaning of the crime.

getting our photo sticker's made,

15
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:03,389
that's when we run into
Jody Santemillion, an English teacher

17
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:07,126
at Teitan High School,
deeply engrossed in a shooting game.

19
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,861
At her insistence,

20
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,530
Ran is set to compete in a fighting game
against a skilled gamer

22
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:15,400
named Kengo Bito
who beats her in no time at all.

24
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:21,273
But during the game
with his next opponent,

26
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:24,343
Mr. Bito ends up getting killed!

27
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,279
There are 4 suspects.

28
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,349
Mr. Bito's opponent, Takakazu Shimizu,

29
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,953
the game arcade attendant,
Hisashi Dejima,

31
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,090
a taxi driver, Toshitsugu Emorl,

32
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,027
and Jody Santemillion.

33
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:47,566
Ju'dgihgfifnom the Eondiition of the body,
I'm positive he was poisoned...

35
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,301
Which means,

36
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,906
that person is the most suspicious.
And the evidence is probably in there.

38
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,511
All that leaves is the needle or
hypodermic syringe...

40
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,313
nothing like that Was on the-floor...

41
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:06,652
and I doubt the killer would still
be hanging on to something like that...

43
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,055
Where...

44
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:13,192
where'd the killer hide
the murder weapon!?

47
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,602
I was picking up a 100 yen coin...

48
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,672

Oh, surex ou did...

65
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,119
he saw you make a mistake
when you played that racing game

67
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:42,388
and he made a fool out you
in front of everybody.

69
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,123
Is that true?

70
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:44,323

Humph!

89
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,901
Well, you had a stronger motive
to kill him!

91
00:03:55,902 --> 00:04:01,240
After all, that guy was your precious
baby sister's boyfriend...

93
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,509
His sister's boyfriend?

94
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,447
They were living together,
or you could say, he was living off of her...

96
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,650
but I guess he can't complain,
he's her brother

98
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,186
and he's a gamer too,
jUSt like that guy was...

100
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,455
And kid, what about you?

101
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:20,593
You wanted him out of the way too,
didn't you?

103
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,328
What do you mean?

113
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,670
That was until that guy came along &
thrashed him,

115
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:32,872
then he dropped out of sight

116
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:36,342
Who would've thought he'd
change his hairstyle

118
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,411
and start working part time
in a game arcade...

120
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,748
Inspector!

121
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:46,085
They found poison in the victim's blood!

122
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:46,886
What!?

123
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,188
The name of the poison is tetrodotoxin!

124
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,590
The point of e'n'tn was the inside of
his upper righ'tiriarm

126
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,260
and it appears the penetration
went up to the artery

128
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,262
Te, tetrodotoxin, that's...

129
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:57,997
Puffer fish poison!!

130
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:02,001
Tetrodotoxin, commonly called TTX.

131
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:05,070
0.5-1 mg would cause instant death,

132
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,606
that's 11500th the amount needed
for a deadly dose of potassium cyanide,

134
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,175
it's a crazy poison...

135
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,877
it is found in most puffer fish.

136
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,481
But when ingested by mouth,
the symptoms progress slowly

138
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,349
and the rate of survival is quite high.

139
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:22,588
When directly introduced unto the
bloodstream, paralysis sets in quickly

141

Now to find where the weapon is hidden...

At any rate,

165
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,674

and go over everything one more time!

What could it be...

00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:02,494
Hey, the shoe lace on your left shoe
is coming loose!

176
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,564
Oh, thanks kid...

177
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,168
it's dangerous, you could've tripped

178
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:12,104
That's who it is...

179
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,506
that's who killed Mr. Bito...

180
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:20,112
the distinct features of these arcades
were used to commit the murder...

182
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,713
But oneithing bothers me...

183
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,985
Why'd that person deliberately do that
in front of the police...

185
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,186
Conan...

187
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,256
What's the matter, Conan?

188
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,189
Come on, hurry!

189
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,658
Oh, yeah!

PW'! U" ll H1! H

192
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,604
Inspector!

193
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,007
We've searched this floor
from top to bottom

195
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,875
but we haven't come up with anything
needle like

197
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,310
that could've been the weapon.

198
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,045
Hmm...

199
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:55,447
according to the video from
the security camera,

201
00:06:55,448 --> 00:07:01,453
none of the suspects left this floor
until the police arrived...

203
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:06,391
Chances are high the killer still has
the weapon, don't you think?

205
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,192
Yes...

206
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:12,798
We'll be taking you all into
another room for a body check.

208
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,133
Humph!

209
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,669
I'll answer all of your questions,
anything you want,

211
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,937
but don't you think you're making
a mistake by suspecting me?

213
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,141
He died while playing against me.

214
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:25,477
I didn't have a chance to poison hum.

215
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,280
Well that goes for me too.

216
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,549
I went up to Mr. Bito

217
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,820
before the game started to collect
the coins in the machine, that's all...

219
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,623
If you're going to do a body check,

220
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,957
you should check Mr. Emorl,

221
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,125
during the game,

222
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,828
he was close to the machine when
he was picking up the coin he dropped.

224
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:48,033
Only that lady was next to Mr. Bito
playing her racing game

226
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,768
Hey wait a minute!

227
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,103
What are you talking about!

228
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:54,707
Miss'Jody was playing the game the
whole time, she couldn't have stopped!

230
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,507
Right?

231
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,442
Right!

232
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,043
No mistake about it!

233
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,846
Besides,

234
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,782
the inspection of the scene just now
proved that, didn't it?

236
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,318
When you're sitting here

237
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:06,985
See!

238
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,655
Your hands don't reach the chair
next to you!

240
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:12,591
I don't think she could have done it, but...

241
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:13,926
Hmm .

242
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,262
Let me say something now.

243
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:21,266
The poison was injected
under Bito's right arm, wasn't it?

245
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:25,137
Ircame up from his left side,
I couldn't have done it, now could I'?

247
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,673
Everybody just calm down.

248
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,876
This is just a formalix ,
so please cooperate...

252
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,414
Sonoko, what's wrong?

253
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:38,484
Good grief, how disappointing

254
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:42,087
Inspector Megure, what's up with you...

255
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,021
Huh?

256
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:48,226
WThe killer's right in front of you,
smiling & you haven't caught on yet...

258
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,628
Wham?

259
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,365
The poison's point of entry was
the inside of his upper right arm.

261
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,832
As Mr Emori himself pointed out,

262
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:58,036
he couldn't have done it because the only
time he came in contact with the victim,

264
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,371
he was on the left.

265
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,907
We can also cross Mr. Dejima out

266
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,176
since he came in contact with the victim
before the game started

268
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:08,447
and after that the victim was seen
talking to Mr. Shimizu

270
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,048
And of course,

271
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,451
Miss Jody was busy playing her game

272
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,452
and we were on the opposite side
of the victim,

274
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,855
so none of us could have done it either...

275
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,126
Then that only leaves...

276
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:22,594
That's right.

277
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,596
Only 1 person remains...

278
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,533
You're the only one who could've done it!!

279
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:32,871
"Fih'at '3 fight.

00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,007
on'h 1 pférgson remains...

281
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,810
You're the onl. one who could've done it!

282
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,845
Takayasu Shimizu...

283
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,317
You're the only one!

284
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:48,921
Haha.

285
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,323
Younglady,
do you know what you're saying...

287
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,725
you watched the video, didn't you?

288
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,928
You saw me getting beaten in the game

289
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:02,000
How could I have poisoned him
in the midst of all that?

291
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:02,935
Heh heh...

292
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,269
no use acting innocent.

293
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,939
You'll see how easy it is when
we demonstrate!

295
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,540
What!?

296
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,275
Ran & Detective Takagl!

298
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:14,413
I hate to ask but will you play that game?

299
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:15,614
Huh?

300
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,817
The answer will come to you right away
when you do it

311
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:35,100
Is the police going to take orders
from a young girl?

313
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:39,238
Well, you may not know it
bUthonoko 3 pretty sharp...

315
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,373
It's starting!

316
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:43,375
Fight!

317
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,385
Wow, that girl's getting a total beating

318
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,255
Hey Takagi, go easy on her.

320
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,795
Oh no!

321
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:12,471
Oh oh...the irl's had it...

322
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,473
Poor thing1

323
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,142
Ta,. Takagl!

324
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,879
I know how much you hate to lose but
don't you'think you went overboard here,

326
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,347
just a little too much?

328
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,086
Sonoko told me to tell Detective Takagl
what to do

330
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,122
She said he would be the girl character

331
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,856
and that he had to blindfold himself
with his necktie

333
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,659
and not do an thin durin the ame,
just go limp!

335
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,529
Then the one controlling
the male character was.

337
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:39,998
It was me!

338
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,199
Sonoko told me to...

339
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,601
Isn't that ri ht, Conan?

340
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:44,536
Yup!

341
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,404
You mean!?

342
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:47,472
That's right...

343
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,074
preconceived notion...

344
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,343
Everyone would assume Ran .,
would be the female character

346
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:54,279
and Detective Takagi the male, correct?

347
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,349
But it was actually the opposite...

348
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,217
jUSt like it was before...

349
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,020
Mr. Bito is Beika's Shisa"

350
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,289
Mr.Shimizu is Haido's Lutus",

351
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:09,094
everyone assumed
they'd use their own characters.

353
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,630
And on top of that,

354
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,498
this game has no hit point gauge

355
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:17,369
so no one can tell who is which character
Just by watching the monitor...

357
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,307
Nobody would notice if they switched

358
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,178
Are you saying Mr. Site was killed
before the game started...

361
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,379
IUD...

362
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,116
Mr. Shimizu had already injected him
and he was either dead

364
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,452
or the poison was just starting to take
effect & he was semi-conscious

366
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,856
Tetrodotoxin causes paralysis...

367
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:41,927
even if Mr. Bito was
alive during the game,

369
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,263
it would have been difficult for him
to sit up straight.

371
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,666
But if that were the case,

372
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:53,672
someone was bound
to notice something was wrong...

374
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:56,742
No, that's not necessarily true!

375
00:12:56,743 --> 00:13:01,246
I let my body 90 limp but everytime
I took a hit,

377
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,148
my arms & legs would move a little

378
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,250
so unless
someone was watching very closely,

380
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,487
it would look like I was playing the game!

381
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,690
And besides, these guards would keep
his body propped up

383
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,425
so he wouldn't fall.

384
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:17,029
This is how Mr. Shimizu did it!

385
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,033
Before the game starts
he goes up to Mr. BRO

387
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,168
and injects him with the poison,

388
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,570
while Mr Bito is struggling,

389
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,106
he finishes the game he's in the midst of.

390
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:31,443
And then starts the new game with
the new character,

392
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,979
hrs. character, Lutus'.!

393
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,716
Then all he has to do is
go to another machine

395
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:42,654
and enter the game as Mr. Bito's
character, Shisa & he's set!

397
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,457
Then you deliver a series of blows
to an unmoving opponent

399
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:50,529
and everyone thinks
you're getting beat up, right?

401
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:55,200
But why didn'tche deliver-the finishing
blow at the end of the game?

403
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:59,471
Because if he had & someone
ran up to MrBito,

405
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:04,543
they (3 see the words You Lose
on his machine when in fact he had won.

407
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,947
If they ended in a draw, Draw would
appear on the screen!

409
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,949
And in a draw,
the game comes to an immediate end!

411
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,220
The character Mr. Bito used
would remain unknown...

413
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,023
What about the weapon?

414
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,125
If what you're saying ls true, girlie,

415
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,626
it should be around some place,
shouldn't it?

417
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,696
Where's the needle or syringe?

418
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,899
That's why we're going to do
a body check...

420
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,834
Humph!

421
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,336
Search all you want but if you don't find it,

422
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:35,107
you're going to be in
a whole lot of trouble...

424
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,109
Of course we won't find it!

426
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,846
You don't have the weapon
on you anymore...

428
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,248
but, I bet you didn't notice...

429
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,252
A certain something has been
following you around...

431
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,387
What do you mean!?

432
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,991
Mr. Dejima, could/you please come here?

433
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:53,925
Why, sure...

434
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:58,597
What is it?

435
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,332
That's fine, you can go back...

436
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,603
Okay.

437
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,471
What was that all about?

438
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,274
Didn't you notice It, Inspector?

439
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,810
Every time he takes a step,
you can hear a strange sound,

441
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:14,479
Iike metal scratching something...

442
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:15,547
What!?

443
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:16,081
Huh?

444
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,417
You mean it's on the bottom of his shoe?

445
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,953
Yes...Mr. Shimizu,

446
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,157
put the used needle inside a cigarette

447
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,491
then stuck some gum to it

448
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,394
and then put it on top of
the gum wrapping paper

450
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,864
and left it on the floor.

451
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,735
Someone would step on it while they were
watching the game on the monitor

453
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:40,305
and then the evidence would be carried
to another location, that was the idea!

455
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,807
And it was done,

456
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,811
when he bent down to pick up
the lighter he dropped...

458
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:51,283
If the cigarette is flattened, you wouldn't
really notice if when you stepped on it

460
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,486
And even if you did notice

461
00:15:54,487 --> 00:16:00,759
you'd just think it was rubbish
& throw it in the trash bin.

463
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,229
I suppose we'll just have to rely on
Mr. Shimizu's good conscience

465
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,432
to see whether he wiped the poison off
the needle before he got rid of it...

467
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,099
Heh heh...

468
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:12,103
He prepared the cigarette trick
before the crime...

470
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,173
probably in the toilet of this arcade.

471
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,444
All he had to do was roll up the paper
& put it into the box of cigarettes

473
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:23,448
then when he took it out,
it wouldn't look suspicious...

475
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,649
I see.

476
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,119
So if we find Mr. Shimizu's fingerprints
on this cigarette or paper,

478
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,121
then we'll have the proof we need...

479
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:30,655
Humph!

480
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,859
I must commend you,
that was one terrific story...

482
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,129
but unfortunatel irlie, this is a tra

485
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,066
Take a look!

486
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,669
Both the gum & the cigarette
aren't my brand

488
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,404
Let me see!

489
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:46,972
Sure...

490
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:47,472
Sure...

491
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:51,343
I'm sure somebody's trying to frame me!

492
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,145
We. a we known fact the chew on
gum during the game to keep rhythmn,

494
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,681
it was even written in a magazine...

495
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,950
Check if you don't believe me,

496
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,753
you're not going to find
my fingerprint on anything!

498
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,624
Aha...now I understand!

500
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,960
That's what bothered me all along

501
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:13,598
I couldn't understand why you would
chew gum in front of the police

503
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,901
when you used gum to hide the weapon!

504
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:20,005
I'll bet you used someone else's gum

505
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:22,974
and cigarette from the ashtrays
in this arcade.

507
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,978
You chewed gum so that just in case
the needle was found,

509
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,813
you could use the excuse you just used.

510
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,550
You used the preconceived notion

511
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,286
th'atsnoicriminal would
deliberately incriminate himself,

513
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,754
to your own advantage...

514
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:39,758
But wouldn't his fingerprints be left
behind when her-injected the victim?

516
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,361
No, if the needle was placed
between his fingers,

518
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,431
it would be possible to commit the crime
& not leave any finger or palmprint!

520
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,433
That's right!

521
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,969
If you were to push the bottom of the
cigarette box, the cigarette would come up

523
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,270
and you could take it out

524
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,507
between your fingers without
getting your fingerprint on it.

526
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,778
But. . .what about a com?

527
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:04,983
Mr. Dejima'? Could you please open up
the coin box on that machine?

529
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,451
Yes ma'am...

530
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:13,124
There should be two 100 yen coins
in there if his story is true, right?

532
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,660
Because before Mr. Bito
started the game,

534
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,796
Mr. Dejima had collected
the coins already...

536
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,666
But I'm sure you'll find 3 coins in there!

538
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,403
Hey! She's right

539
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,073
There's 3 in here!

540
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,941
You're right...

541
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:34,746
1 of them is-the coin Mr. Bito put in
to start the game...

543
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:38,350
another will be Detective Takagi's,
he just finished his game...

545
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:46,491
& the last one is the coin the killer put in
when he started the camouflage game.

547
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:46,825
Ll f-

548
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,226
That's right...

549
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,427
Mr. Shimizu,

550
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,963
your fingerprints should be all over that

551
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,099
100 yen coin.

552
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,704
But we won't know until
we have it analyzed...

554
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:00,905
Sure we do...

555
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:04,909
the coins were collected
before Mr. Shimizu got here...

557
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,213
He probably thought
it wouldn't pose a problem

559
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:12,384
if a coin with his fingerprint was found
in a mountain of other coins...

561
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,755
Anothe'rrthing', unless he wore gloves,

562
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:20,091
he wouldn't be able to drop the coin in
without getting his fingerprint on it...

564
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,960
You'll find them...

565
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,428
my fingerprints are on it...

566
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,298
I had a tight grip on it
when I dropped it in...

568
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,769
That's because I intended that
to be my last game...

570
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,504
Your last game?

571
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:33,704
Yeah...

572
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:38,243
I intended to bid farewell to these games
as well as to that guy...

574
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:42,647
it was for my sister's sake,
she's in the hospital, almost blind...

576
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,183
Almost blind?

577
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,520
Do you now how she got that way?

578
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,524
Vitamin A deficiency due to malnutrition...

579
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,860
Haha.
Can you imagine, in this day & age...

581
00:19:56,095 --> 00:20:00,632
That guy's gambling debts were so high

582
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,068
and my sister was working like crazy
this past month

584
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:06,137
trying to repay those debts,
she hardly ate anything...

586
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,139
But after an he put [her through,

587
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,076
she still refused to break up with him...

588
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,945
I don't know how\ ou could Have played
games with someone like that.

590
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,416
He told me that

591
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:24,022
if I won just 1 game against him,
he'd leave my sister alone.

593
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:30,161
I pratioed & got good enough
to be called Lutus of Haido, but...

595
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,299
I just couldn't beat him...

596
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,166
so you-killed him?

598
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,769
IUD...

599
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,372
but you know, Inspector...l regret it now...

600
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:45,643
That unbeatable character
he controlled, Shisa,

602
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:48,980
I destroyed my chance
to beat it with my own hands...
