1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:05,621
Friendship, Romance, Mystery
Because we cherish them we can continue

3
00:00:05,622 --> 00:00:07,373
Beginning of the yeargstarts with the
Detective squad!

5
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,408
Instead of a monkey's butt its
Genta's

7
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:10,959
He sees through the:one and only truth,

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,711
A child in appéarance
with. the I.Q. of'an adult

10
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,947
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

13
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,884
Hey!! Is it for real

14
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,720
that 'Ai and you:were almost.-kidnapped

15
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,456
Yeah
but we somehow made it through safely

17
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,426
The kidnapper got away though

18
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,894
I'm really glad for you both!

19
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:13,165
Since you both recovered from your cold
and .got to comerto school!

21
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,450
We were really worried about you!

22
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:16,735
Thank you

23
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,137
I'm perfectly:fine now

24
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,940
We actually wanted to go see you but

25
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:26,712
Conan insisted "that we shouldn't go-see you
dmbecause'we'd catch yourkcold

27
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,579
Right...?

28
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,213
Yes!

29
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,382
Oh. is that so

30
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:34,353
We even decided.on what time
to go see you and yet

32
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,687
He had th nerve to tell.us
not to come see,you

34
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:38,340
Now that I'm relieved. I'm starved

35
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:38,924
Not again!!

36
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:40,292
Um...

37
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,328
Are sure it's really safe?

38
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,831
For me-to go outside

39
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,934
Yeah petty much... for now

40
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,970
WwW. What do you mean, pretty much

41
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:56,391
Al removed all the wiretap
that was set up in Doc's house

43
00:02:56,392 --> 00:03:01,530
and in fact; I went browsing around here
alone last night

45
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:03,248
disguised as you

46
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:09,605
I asked mom {0 helpgme
disguise myself.as.you once more!

48
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,956
HmmsShinichi

49
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,059
you 10OK just great!~What do you think?

50
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,060
You think so

51
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,096
D.Doing something dangerous
Iike that on your own again

53
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:23,368
There was nobody watching me
or anybody suspicious following me

55
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,271
I wouldn't say that it's 1006 safe,

56
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:30,842
but mot the type who can stayed
Iocked up just because I'm scared.

58
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:34,613
I decided to believe her words for now

59
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,882
I lose.

60
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,518
I'll give up on Sherry

61
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,752
Her words?

62
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,822
Besides. you prettyymuch recovered too,
haven-tiyou?

64
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:47,259
Isn't it because pressure
from those guys disappeared?

66
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,064
(BI%R)

67
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:56,101
(ma)
Look for the Mark on
the Buttocks Part 1

70
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,369
(ma)

71
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,774
An FBI agent?!

72
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,309
S,Sonokol!

73
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,278
RR Really

74
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,513
Sfionoko

76
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,649
But!
Y.You mean Jodie is?!

78
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,316
No kidding?!

79
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,618
S Sonoko!!

80
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,986
This is a hospital! /

81
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,153
Be quiet

83
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,121
Oh...

84
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,289
I'm sorry

85
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,490
Don't worry about it

86
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,994
Why'd. you think of working
as an Englishiteacher'in Japan...?

88
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,496
D.Don't tell me that you're an undercover
agent investigating something?

90
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,764
Sonoko...

91
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,499
No-NO!

92
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,135
Oh...that's not it

93
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,437
I There.was a culprit I was
after for a long time.

95
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,840
But I carelessly lost track of that person.

96
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,576
So. I was given time off
from work for a while,

98
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,076
that's why I came to Japan!

99
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:45,817
A really honestly: love Japanese games!

101
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,986
G:Games...

103
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,689
I became an English teacher,

104
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,325
because I always wanted to
be one for a long time!

106
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,695
But. my time off has come to an end!

107
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,963
As soon as the wound
on my stomach heals.

109
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:01,533
I have to head back to the States!

110
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:05,937
Then, the treasure map you said
you'd been looking for all this time is...

112
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:09,608
I got a call from my boss telling me
to come home

114
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,576
because they got a clue
to the culprit that I've been looking for!

117
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:15,280
He said he's going-to give me
a chance to make:things right again!

119
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,182
See...

120
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:22,454
I wanted-to say good bye to
cool'kid, before leaving too

122
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,338
so. I-went.to.Doc"s house. ¥*

123
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,425
That's when I saw cool kid and Al

124
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:30,729
¢ being pushed into the car and taken away
by some suspicious looking people,

126
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,129
so I went after them with my car!

127
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,603
I cornered them by a pier...

129
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:38,937
nd...
I cornered them by a pier...

132
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,939
They suddenly fired a gun at me

133
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,807
They suddenly fired a gun at me.

134
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,409
Se. I did likewise!

135
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,011
Oh...

136
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:50,816
Of:course, the gun was what I had
taken-from the suspicious people!

138
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,651
But. I was sure lucky!!

139
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:56,138
That Ran was hiding
in the trunk of the car.

141
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,357
And that she protected Al...

142
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,126
Because back then,
I was shot in the stomach

144
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,046
and couldn't move.

145
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,715
Moreover, the kidnappers were planning
to give up kidnapping and

147
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,901
kill the children!

148
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,003
R:Really?

150
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,208
I found the pictures of Conan
and Shinichi hidden and pasted

152
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:20,128
behind-the mirror in 'the«restroom of
Jodie's condo.»

154
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,849
So I went to Jodie's place
to ask her about them

156
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,951
But, she wasn't home,

157
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,922
so I was ready to leave when I
saw her car in front of her condo.

159
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,759
The trunk of the car was open
so I took the liberty of...

161
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,927
So, you took the liberty of .
I mean you know

163
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,362
Huh

164
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:43,468
Im sure.glad yourweren't
2 bad person after all. Jodie!

166
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,072
I mean, I thought: that
you were-involved in some way

168
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,141
with the case that 'Shinichi is involved in...

169
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,277
Andlz~that you were being threatened \
by the culprit to take pictures of Shinichi

171
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:55,847
to find out what his weaknesses were...

172
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,451
I had every mind to confront
the culprit directly and beatthim up...

174
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,887
Hey, Ran!! Are you serious?!

175
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,790
I mean the things you think of
are so unreal...!!

177
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,125
Oh! Those pictures that-are pasted

178
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:10,996
there are of people thatufve
befriended in Japan!

180
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:11,997
What?!...

181
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,867
I actually had them: pasted
on the living room board

183
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:20,105
when one of my Japanese friends came over,
she had a queer look on her face so

185
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,407
I decided to move the pictures
over.to where:they:are:now!

187
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,809
I see!

188
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,845
Americans often have pictures
of their families

190
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:30,048
all over the desk at their work place too...

192
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,818
It's not too customary to do
something like that in Japan

194
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,086
so. I guess it's only natural that
it would be thought of as odd...

196
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:38,573
Come to think of it, even when
I went to watch an opera in New York...

198
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:40,826
the actresses had a lot of pictures pasted

199
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,361
all over the mirror
of their dressing oom.

202
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:48,633
you mean the time when you and Shinichi
were attacked by the street ripper!

204
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:54,172
Take care, because I've heard
that they appear in this area recently too!

206
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,841
Oh4dwe will...

208
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,544
Somebody's here...

209
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,248
I guess we'd better be going then...

210
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,885
I hope you get well son. Jodie,

211
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,787
Thank you so much, both of you!!

212
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,555
Please excuse us...

213
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,660
Howyre you doing?

214
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,596
All right. somehow...

215
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,966
The shot fortunately missed
my vital point so...

217
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,068
By the way, were the Japanese police

218
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,337
convinced with the explanation
we gave them?

220
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,371
Yeah...

221
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,373
After hearing the siren of the police car,

222
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:32,476
one of the kidnappers took the boy
hostage and fled.

224
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:36,314
Then he disappeared leaving the car
and the boy behind in the forest...

226
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,217
The other one who's leg was fractured

227
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,486
committed suicide with the gun
he had on him...

229
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,053
Unfortunately,

230
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:45,490
since it was the dark, neither
yoURner the children could see theiface

232
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,560
of the kidnapper who fled...

233
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,931
Of course I made both children say
the same thing...

235
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:57,168
I didn't want to create a sensation
by publicizing that

237
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,939
the kidnapperwas actress Chris Vineyard
after having failed to take her in,

239
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,142
on top. of not knowing what the actual
motive of the kidnapping was...

241
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,145
We also felt bad about
making you work undercover here

243
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:11,049
without acquiring permission
from the Japanese police, so...

245
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:16,187
The problem is that girl...who was called
by the name Sherry by that woman...

247
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,856
boos

248
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,295
I wonder if she'll accept

250
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,737
Well, it seems like the F.B.l. is in on this
too so I'm sure

252
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,874
they can't make any moves
that easily either!

254
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,542
Come to think. of it,

255
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:41,746
Doc was saying that you got a phone call
from Jodie this morning

257
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,948
What did she want?

258
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:43,848
Huh

259
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,519
Was it to verify whether
we didn't contradict. each.other?

261
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,455
Well "guess so...

262
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,826
I'll be frank with you...

264
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:58,529
We would like you to accept
the witness; protection program...

267
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,866
Back then, Chris Vineyard...

268
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,103
Yes...the lady called Belimott,

269
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,440
tried to Kill-you to keep you from talking...

270
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:13,745
In other words, it's obvious that
you have information

272
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,547
that she finds very inconvenient...

273
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,749
I think you-already know-what

274
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,185
the witness protection program is
about from movies and novels,

276
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,521
in which your name, personal history,
addressand everything else

278
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,690
IS changed to that
of a totally different identity

280
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:29,394
in order to protect you
from the people who are after your life...

282
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:33,398
You will be guaranteed sufficient
income and other miscellaneous things

284
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,469
from the country for life, and I will see to
it that you get™o live a happy life...

286
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,472
Of course whether you.want to accept
TS or not 1s:up to you...

288
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,524
However. once you accept it

289
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:46,211
you will not be able to.see or call
our family and!friends...

291
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:50,448
If you're afraid of that woman coming
after you in revenge

293
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:54,786
If you don't want to get
your friends involved...

295
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:58,123
I'll be waiting for you to
give me a:good:answer...

297
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,691
What's up Ail?

298
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,159
Maybe her cold's...

299
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,494
Huh?...

300
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,162
No. that's not.it...

301
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,749
It's been a whilé since I came outside.
Oo I'm just a bit tired...

303
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,168
Bye then. because I'm. going this:way...

304
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,553
See you tomorrow!

305
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,138
I'll see you at school!

306
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,556
Okay!

307
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,680
I feel great
splashing in the rain...

309
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,998
splash, splash

310
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:25,417
La, la...

311
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,366
Ouch!

312
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,101
Heave., heave...

313
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,988
Street ..Street ripper!!
Somebody, get him 1

315
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:48,773
Huh?

316
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:49,874
Whooooaaaaah

317
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,743
Kyaaaaaaa=

319
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,845
It's Ayumi's voice...

320
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,181
\ aaah!

321
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:01,686
Whaaa!

322
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,657
What's up?!

323
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,058
Ayumil!

324
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,259
Ay/unfii?!

325
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,600
I sea...

326
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,603
So, you don't'remember that
person's. face.

328
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,803
N.No...

329
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,456
It was raining and

331
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:21,840
It was raining and,
I was wearing my raincoat-and-hat...

333
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,292
It was raining-and
I was wearing my!ca'incoatl~j;and"hat>.»...

336
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,846
Besides. "was sO scared.
I couldn't look atitheiperson;s face!

338
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,181
Even the lady victim
who got her armed slashed

340
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,150
didn't see the culprit's face...

342
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,320
Judging from the way things 15Ok

343
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,255
the culprit is probably the same as the one

344
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,957
who committed
the other three previous cases...

346
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,126
But. the outfit is different...

347
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,260
I heard. the person shout, Wt $o006ah

348
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,063
I'm sure it was a man!!

350
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:47,832
000000

351
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,433
But, youi{can't really tell
just.from a shouting véice...

353
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,803
Either way.

354
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:55,039
Let's go to the scene of the crime
and do an inspection!

356
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,442
Maybe you'll remember something...

357
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,743
Yup!

358
00:12:58,744 --> 00:12:59,144
Yup!

359
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:02,680
Bumped into the street
ripper-over here...

361
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:07,085
We heard Akemi scream so
we came running over

363
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:11,556
Which means that the culprit.ran.away
because you and the others.came?

367
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,560
He fled before that!

368
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,760
Oh...

369
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:20,431
Before he ran away,
he:came towards me once,

371
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,366
Oo I was: surprised:but...

372
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,168
He'came towards:you?!

373
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:23,835
Yep!

374
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:28,373
I heard a clinkingisound afterwards
SO I'm sure he picked something: up!

376
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,526
Maybe he dropped loose
change or something?

378
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:34,412
Maybe:it was his glasses or house key...

379
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:38,216
ItFcould ve been a necklace of bracelet...

380
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:42,187
Do you know what the-culprit picked up?

381
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,454
Nope...

382
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,758
I think it has something {6 do
with the: number 5!

384
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,726
The number 57...

385
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:54,465
Because there's a mark that looks like
the number 5 on the palm of my hand!

387
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:59,003
I looked around-the-area-after
that but I saw nothing on:the ground...

389
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,605
Can you drawer-picture
of thelmark- for me?!

391
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:01,873
Yes: I can.

393
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,512
It looked like this...

394
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,950
It doesn't look like a
50 yen coin or a 500 yen coin either...

396
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,520
I Kind of, looks like the letter-"S
of the alphabet too.

398
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,790
Well, I'll try go looking for traces
of this mark...

400
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:21,125
Boon

401
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,877
It could be a mark left behind
by some coin

403
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:25,196
from a slot machine
game center or something...

405
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,699
Oh~~~1]

406
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,668
T.There he is!!

408
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,402

412
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,410
Wow!

413
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,278
Oops!

414
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,014
Damn!! Its so-hard to get through
with [so manysonlookers..}

416
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,883
Ge There is he, the man in the raincoat!!

417
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,018
There's the street ripper.

418
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,686
Hey-!!

419
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,421
Oh- wait...

420
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,789
Why you

422
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,326

WisssVVAEW hat a thing to do...

429
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,472
Hey, @fficer Takagi,

430
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,475
didn't a man wearing a raincoat
come running this way?

432
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,845
Here are so many of them:here...

433
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,614
Because it just stopped raining...

436
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,216
But, Wow bod.

437
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,685
To come back wearing araincoat to the
site of the crime.

439
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,687
Knowing that/the police IS
conducting investigations...

441
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,290
Yeah...
the culprit:probably figured that

443
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,759
) the police wouldn't think that
he would-come"back in the same fashion

445
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,093
as. when:he:committed the crime...

446
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,496
Don't tell me that he: came back to take
revenge-thinking

448
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,231
that Ayumiihad seen his face...?

449
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,066
No way

450
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,169
He probably came back because he was \
positive that she didn't see his face!

452
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,171
F:For what?

453
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:43,508
Beats me...He may have forgotten
something at the site

455
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,643
that he shouldn't have left'-behind-"

456
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,712
On: maybe he came back
to.confirm something

458
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,082
Darn..I"m:all wet...

459
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:55,653
Anywy S top priority to figure out
what:this mark that Ayumi. drew-is...

461
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,788
H.Hey!!

462
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,006
Agh!!

463
00:15:58,007 --> 00:15:59,057
Gfienta'?!

464
00:15:59,058 --> 00:15:59,924
Huh ?!

465
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,126
Y.Your buttocks. Genta

466
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,195
What?! Is it ripped or something?

468
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:06,130
The: mark that the street ripper left
behind is there!

470
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,132
The mark that the street ripper left
behind is there!!

472
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,067
What?!!

473
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,668
No kidding?!

474
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:14,472
That means he must've come in contact
withfthe culprit somewhere...

476
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,474
Genta. please try and remember!!

477
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,475
Huh

478
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,010
Where on earth did you?!...

480
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,214
Please answer. GentaHV

481
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,550
Where on earth
did you get that mark on?!

483
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,853
The mark of the street ripper
that is on your buttocks!!

485
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:32,156
I.wonder if this is really a mark
Ieft.-behind by the street ripper?

487
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:32,924
Yup!

488
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,995
It looks just like the mark that wasy
on the thing that the culprit dropped!

490
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,497
I coincidentally pressed
my hand against-it,

492
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,233
when the culprit got flustered,
came back toiget it and then fled.

494
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,803
After that, the same mark was left
on the palm of my hand...

496
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,672
Which-meansithat

497
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,793
Genta touched the culprit or the culprit's
belongings somewhere along the line...

499
00:16:51,827 --> 00:16:54,345
It could've been when
you went after the culprit

501
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,750
who was among the crowd and
wearing a raincoat, went fleeing!

503
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,818
BB. But...

504
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:04,188
The-bag of somebody in the crowd,

505
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,392
staggered and.bumped into a bicycle,

506
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,460
it wasn't the culprit!

507
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,928
B.Besides.

508
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,829
Huh?

509
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,066
It.It's nothing...

510
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,470
Could it be that the mark
that was on the bag.and the bicycle were

512
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:23,141
the same as the mark
on the culprits belongings?

514
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:27,578
If so, it could've been
a name brand item...

516
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,549
Let's go back to the site and
ask the people in the areal

518
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,486
Besides the owners of the bag and
the bicycle may still be there...

520
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,425
Officer Sato...

521
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,893
O,Officer Sato?!

522
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,428
Oh, yes...

524
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,365
Yeah...

525
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,568
It's strange...
The mark that was left

527
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,437
on Genta's buttocks...

528
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,372
It: looks familiar...

529
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,309
Oh! There!!!

531
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,611
rippe over is mans ag...

532
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,548
But, there's nothing that looks like that
mark on the bag...

535
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:08,753
Besides, the bag isn't dirty at all
so I don't thin his is the one

537
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:13,024
Because the mark on Genta's buttocks
Iooked to be soiled with mud...

539
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:16,828
If he was soiled with mud,
maybe the bicycle is a better bet?

541
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,097
And. where is that bicycle?

543
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,233
There she is! She's the lady!

544
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:23,501
Poooo

547
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:28,940
It's true that itsis"soiled with:mud but...

548
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,375
The mark doesn't seem to-be there.

549
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,312
Where on earth did you get

550
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,914
I that number 5 or S of the alphabet
Iooking mark on you...?

552
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,916
It's neither a 5 nor an SS...

553
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:39,884
Huh?

554
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:43,271
The mark that is on the palm. of
Ayumrs hand and Game's buttocks

556
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:46,324
IS a reverse and mirrored image of
the actual shape.

558
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:50,962
In other words the actual shape is
a shape that is opposite that of an 5 or:S.

560
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,497
Oh, I see!

561
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,099
And what about the size of the mark? Ii

562
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,836
If that something left this big asmark
on Ayumils palm think

564
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,706
that she would have an idea of
what it is...

566
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,709
No... Mine was much smaller!

568
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,479
It was here about the size of
a one yen coin!

570
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,152
Which means that the two were
the same mark on separate things...

572
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:19,123
If it was that small...It could've been an
accessory of the same brand...

574
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:22,059
Mirrored image...accessory...

575
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,729
Huh=:the:'mark on the sleeve...

576
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,297
D.Don:t tell me that?!...

578
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,103
O:Officer Sato?

579
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,440
This!! It's this mark!!

580
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,310
What!! Officer Sato...

581
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,913
Yes..:After I drove through a muddy road,
I didn't wash the car,

583
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,315
I sO those traces were left behind...

584
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:48,786
. Come to think of it. you were sitting
on the/hood of Officer Sato's car,

586
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,121
weren't you, Genta?

587
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,789
Y.Yeah...

588
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,058
Why didn't you tell us right away?

589
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,228
Well. it crossed my mind to begin with

590
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:01,999
but I didn't say anything...
But, I didn't think...it can't be!

592
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,736
I didn't think that Officer Sato
was a street ripper sol!

594
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,338
1.I'm Not one!!!

595
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:07,672
LE not one

596
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:13,144
The culprit probably has
the same model caras I do!

598
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,078
Then

599
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,147
the mark that.was on'my palm...

600
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,866
Is the key to! the: car of thisr-model!

601
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:23,788
A cover with this mark:carved.on
it comes with the master key!

605
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,156
S>CC.

606
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,757
No kidding!

607
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:30,194
As proof of it. look at
the tip of Ayumi's sleeve!

609
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:33,231
See the zigzag vertical lines on it?

610
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,298
UP"...

611
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,716
True.

612
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:38,703
That's probably because
there was dirt on the tip of the key...

614
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,972
and when it.was pressed
against her hand,

616
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,307
traces of it stuck on to the tip
of her sleeve...?!

618
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,376
No. it's not dirt...

619
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,646
It's discolored and:-black...
butithis is...

621
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,047
blood?!

622
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:54,652
M:Maybe the reason
why the culprit came back here is...

624
00:20:54,653 --> 00:21:00,191
Yes.probably to check whether Ayumi
and Genta saw this mark...

627
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:05,146
And after seeing our undercover
police car, the culprit probably figured

629
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:08,065
that it would be a matter of
time before everything is disclosed...

631
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:11,068
Then, we'd better hurry or
the culprit will get away!!

633
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,371
Officer Takagi, get a hold of
Inspector Megure

635
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,406
and have him set up a cordon!!

636
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:19,243
Check all the drivers that are
driving cars with the same mark

638
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,145
that are trying to leave this areal!

639
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,546
Y.Yes!!

640
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:27,818
Also check all the inhabitants in the is
area. who own the same model car!

642
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,688
If the culprit is a person who will risk
coming back to confirm

644
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,257
whether the model of
his car had been specified,

646
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:37,328
it's likely that. he has
a parking space or storeroom nearby!

648
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,497
Okay!

649
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:43,000
But, what if there are many cars like it?

650
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,868
D be one hell of a.job looking for it...

651
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:47,738
No, I don't think there are that.many...

652
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:51,826
The modal of this; car with this mark
Onfltheikéyriénd Body is

654
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:56,347
pretty old: and.-manufacturing of
it stoppéd-about:7 or'8 yars ago.

656
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,749
Besides, it was raining
when 'the crime=-was-commiitted.

658
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,018
If we were to search for a culprit whose
car is wet in the rain,

660
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,754
with no alibi and
who has lost his master key,

662
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,890
the criteria for the search would be
drastically narrowed down...

664
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,626
Why doesn't the culprit have
the master key?

666
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,728
He probably had it but dropped it.

667
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:15,466
A blood stain in the shape of a key
was left on the sleeve of Ayumiis outfit...

669
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:19,070
This serves as proof that the culprit
grabbed the key with hands

671
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,672
soiled with the blood
of the victim and fled!

673
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:25,743
This means that the culprit will not show
the police the key,

675
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:30,147
which he knows will display %
haematological response!!
