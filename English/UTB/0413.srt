It was set up afterwards, Inspector...
The entire house was lifted up with a crane.

00:03:05,956 --> 00:03:11,061
No one would ever think that such a

It's amazing how they can
think up a trick like that.

It makes me so happy .

69
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:31,180
I think that the "52nd Closed Door Murder
is a great mystery story too.

Mr. Mouri...

The smell of almond
t's poisoning by cyanic acid.

205
00:07:49,707 --> 00:07:53,743
There was po son in the coffee
cup that was on the floor...

207
00:07:53,744 --> 00:07:57,480
NO poison whatsoever was
detected in the other three cups.

209
00:07:57,481 --> 00:08:01,451
In other words, the culprit put
poison only in Mr. Yagami's cup...

211
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:06,389
That's right. Mr. Keda, you're
the one who got the drinks?

213
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:11,527
Yes sir. I took everyone's order

214
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:13,196
Everyone usually drinks hot
coffee while I drink Japanese tea.

216
00:08:14,264 --> 00:08:18,701
But, doesn't a staff of the TV station
usually serve tea and things likc that?

218
00:08:18,702 --> 00:08:21,104
OO, TR

219
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:24,640
I'm still a fledgling scriptwriter, so
I try to help out whenever I can...

221
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:29,045
Is: somethin¢ strange about what I did?

222
00:08:29,046 --> 00:08:32,382
No. not really...

223
00:08:32,383 --> 00:08:36,635
see! One of the cups in the hot
water room was smeared with poison

225
00:08:36,636 --> 00:08:39,305
and«that-cup just happened
to go to Mr. Yagami.

227
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:44,659
Oh { $6 ousre sa Ing: that someones
wanted to commit at random murder?

229
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,896
I can't think of anything else...

230
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:54,904
So. you said: that you d-serve the coffee
but Mr. Koda insisted on doing it himself.

232
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:57,507
Yes. he said he'd do it... himself

233
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,611
May I have a moment with you. Inspector .

234
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:08,117
Ms. Inouo. will you ploasc como with mo?

236
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:14,624
Judging from the circumstances

237
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,960
the only one who would've been able
to mix the poison in the drink is Mr. Koda.

239
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:22,999
His remark of it being a random killing is
shaky justification

241
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,435
and we feel that he's our man

242
00:09:25,436 --> 00:09:27,970
But. what's his motive?

243
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:30,373
You brat, I told ou to stay in your room

244
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:34,510
Butyhe's writing for the same
program, isn't he?

246
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:36,779
Why would he want to
poison his colleague?

248
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,115
He may be a colleague but...

250
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:41,651
Is something bothering your

251
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:45,121
Please tell us about it. This is
a homicide case. you know!

253
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:50,760
The scripts of Dotective Fluke wero
ply (Ol) WIRE Ly Cot

255
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:51,461
The scripts of "Detective Fluke" were
originally being written by both

257
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:55,448
Mr. Yagami and Mr. Sakumadby turns.

258
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:58,433
Then, this man who introduced himself
as a fervent fan of the program brings

260
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:02,605
a plot that he had written to me.

261
00:10:02,606 --> 00:10:05,141
J te 6) foo) IR
to be verytintcresting.

263
00:10:05,142 --> 00:10:08,144
So, I decided to have him work for us
as our 3rd scriptwriter.

265
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:14,283
Although Mr. Sakuma evaluated him highly,
Mr. Yagami for some reason didn't like him

267
00:10:15,652 --> 00:10:20,957
Therefore, Mr. Yagami had repctedly
told me to take him off the program...

269
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,759
Bid"Mr. Koda know about this?

270
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,329
I think he could sense it
from the atmosphere.

272
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,998
I'm sure it was a very trying
situation for Mr. Koda...

274
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:30,600
Which means...?

275
00:10:30,968 --> 00:10:32,601
Ms. Inoue.

276
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:35,938
I want to write as many scripts of
this popular program as I can,

278
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:39,675
sell my name and succeed as a scriptwriter.

00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:59,262
He does have a motive...

286

But. if he did do it...

287
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:16,077

00:11:27,824 --> 00:11:30,659
Besides. there are things
that are not solved yet

295
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:35,097
Quiet!! I'll make him spit it out!
I. Detective Kogoro Mouri will!

You:re'suspecting that I did it? N.No way...

300
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:49,312
Well, it's true that I
slightly hated him. but...

302
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:54,016
Mr. Mouri, even if I wore to have

00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:56,452
I wouldn't make Mr. Yagami drink it./

306
00:11:56,453 --> 00:11:59,805
Because out of the three cups
onl one-would be roisoned.

310
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:03,793
Moreover. I left to go get milk
so I wasn't there

312
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:05,861
In ether words,
I didn't urge him to drink it.

314
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:09,098
In other words,
I didn't urge him to drink it.

316
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:11,834
But Mr. Yagami drank
it of his own initiative...

318
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:14,470
could've known that Mr. Yagami
would choose the coffce cup he chose.

320
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:15,805
Am I wrong?

321
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:17,005

That's it. If he's the ki ler

how did he make Mr. Yagami choose
the cup he drank out of?

00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:45,334

No, though he 1s my superior

we know each other quite
well, so even back then

352
00:13:10,627 --> 00:13:16,465
I took the coffee cup before Mr. Yagami
and gave him the remaining cup .

358
00:13:22,372 --> 00:13:26,142
Mr. Mouri, if you want to implicate
me SO much

361
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:31,080
Just what kind of trick did I use to
make sure Mr. Yagami drank the poison?

363
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:34,683
Figure that out first

364
00:13:34,684 --> 00:13:39,955
Those challening eyes, he's gotta be
the suspect

366
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:44,527
And he's confident about the trick he used.

That's true. Didn't it cross his
mind that an accident could occur?

Hmm?! Hoy!
Are you listening to me. Mr Mouri.

Actually, that was tho first plot
that Mr. Koda brought here.

420
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:27,413
I was also surprised that 1 new
scriptwriter with such talent existed

What /!

423
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,551
Mr Koda also wrote the

00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:35,054
Yes. what is it?

426
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,490
Don't tell me.

429
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:40,960

both Mr. Yagami and Mr. Sakuma.

There's only one way

you've reached

456
00:16:34,014 --> 00:16:37,082
Inspector! This is no joke.

457
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:42,988
The rate of success 1S 50%
You took a s nk or swim chance.

460
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:45,558
Your desperate feeling of not
wanting to be removed

462
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,693
from the script writing of "Detective Fluke

463
00:16:47,694 --> 00:16:50,930
made you take the dreadful
risk of sink or swim.

465
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:53,866
- That's enough.;Mr Mour

466
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:57,236
No. Inspector! I'm saying
this with conviction.

468
00:17:03,476 --> 00:17:04,777
M.Mr= Mouri?!

469
00:17:05,311 --> 00:17:07,313
Could this be the rumored...

471
00:17:07,314 --> 00:17:09,181
Sleeping Kogoro?!

472
00:17:09,182 --> 00:17:12,051
I took a sink or swim chance?

473
00:17:12,052 --> 00:17:14,553
Are ou serious about What ou're sa ing?

474
00:17:14,554 --> 00:17:17,323
At one point I really thought so. but...

475
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:20,392
MM. Mr. Mouri. my God...

476
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:23,045
Please hear me out. Inspector.

477
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:30,169
Mr Koda. you said, to solve the mystery of
the trick you used to make Mr. Yagami

479
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,088
cheese the poisoned coffee (if
we're 90mg to bUbl-NIH-fl you.

481
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:35,574
But that's impossible. Because.

482
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:39,878
You used no trick to begin with.

483
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:41,012
T.There's no trick?!

484
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:41,981
T.There*s no trick?!

485
00:17:42,215 --> 00:17:44,016
No. nothing at all.

486
00:17:44,017 --> 00:17:47,586
If SO. how did he make
Mr. Yagami drink the poisoned coffee?

488
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:54,793
Before I tell you that, please let me explain
how I came to such a-conclusion.

490
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:56,395
Conan. bring me the stuff.

491
00:17:56,396 --> 00:17:57,596
Oh, oka...

492
00:17:57,864 --> 00:17:58,230
Oh, oka...

493
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:05,070
This 1s the list of the scripts of
Detective Fluke that Conan just borrowed.

495
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:07,573
I was surprised at seeing this

496
00:18:07,574 --> 00:18:14,113
One among severa scripts is an
extremely well written mystery story.

498
00:18:14,114 --> 00:18:17,650
Ingenious tricks. logical mystery solving.

499
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:21,754
And most of all a story development
that sticks to unbiased standards...

501
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:25,357
For example, "52nd Closed*Door Murder
is one of them.

503
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:27,493
So is "Supporting Performers Club,

504
00:18:27,494 --> 00:18:29,428
Evil Well Murder.

505
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:32,698
And When the Door of Fate Opens *

506
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:34,783
hose scripts are all

507
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:37,935
es, all those scripts that
I thought to be amazing

509
00:18:37,936 --> 00:18:43,275
were those that you have written Mr. Koda

510
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,847
re Ofter ne 0X
that's when I changed my mind.

513
00:18:48,848 --> 00:18:50,883
When I found out,
that's when I changed my mind.

516
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:51,183
A person such as you who writes such
a perfect mystery story would never

518
00:18:51,184 --> 00:18:54,586
A personlsuch as you who writes such
a perfect mystery story would never

520
00:18:54,587 --> 00:18:59,291
take a sink or swim chance
when the SUCLLbS nan us {>070

522
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:03,195
and I Hogan to GUOSLHON Your Mowe...

524
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:03,796
That's, why: did youmleave the place
back then

526
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:07,633
That is, why did younleave the place
back then.

528
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:12,671
You of course had it in mind beforehand
that you would say that you forgot the milk.

530
00:19:12,672 --> 00:19:16,208
You may have wanted to
instill the impression on everyone

532
00:19:16,209 --> 00:19:18,677
that you had nothing to do with
which cup of coffee

534
00:19:18,678 --> 00:19:21,347
We Ye oh end) Me, Sra
were going to choose. but

536
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:24,950
that action of yours is suspiciously
strange after all

538
00:19:24,951 --> 00:19:27,319
Because as Inspector Meguro
had mentioned earlier...

540
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:33,325
If byrchance, Mr. Sakuma had -chosen
the poisoned coffee instead of Mr. Yagami.

542
00:19:33,326 --> 00:19:36,462
You would've 'had to stop him
from drinking it no matter what.

544
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:42,201
That's right, no matter how goed your plan
IS It can always go wrong.

547
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:47,406
You, who writes flawless mysteriesm would
not overlook that fact

550
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:50,275
Nevertheless. you left the meeting room

552
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:54,413
There 1s only one possible answer.

553
00:19:55,248 --> 00:19:59,418
You did not only target Mr Yagami!

554
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:03,122
At aout

555
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:05,524
Just what are you trying to get at,
Mr. Mouri?...

557
00:20:05,657 --> 00:20:09,962
It didnrtomatter whether
Mr. Yagami or Mr. Sakuma drank it.

559
00:20:11,664 --> 00:20:14,299
That's why no trick needed to be used

560
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:19,438
In other words, you're saying that I V
he didn't care which of us hé killed!

562
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:22,541
You monn it was such
flimsy murder plan?!

564
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:25,611
This is no flimsy plan Inspector

565
00:20:25,612 --> 00:20:29,415
No matter who.dies,
the result:he 'wantsiis achieved.

569
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,384
So long as one of the two main
scriptwriters disappears

571
00:20:32,385 --> 00:20:34,853
the chance of the 3rd scriptwriter,

572
00:20:34,854 --> 00:20:37,823
Mr. Koda getting to intreduccehis
writings would increase tremendously...

574
00:20:37,824 --> 00:20:41,560
He wanted to write as many scripts of
Detective Fluke" as he possibly could.

576
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:45,130
This 1s probably the real motive
for the murdefithat was committed.

00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:46,397
