It was late last night
when he came to my place.

Then to catch the first train

188
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,851
He left my place around 4:30 in the morning.

189
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:38,457
So, he left your apartment
and headed to the station

191
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,625
and this was the street that he took...

194
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,396

It was 10 minutes
after he left Mr. Mizuhara's, apartment.

213
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,224
The train station is this way
hospital is: located before the station.

215
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,227
$0 it'll be like this
though its a rough sketch...

217
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,497
Mr. Takagi, since I was interrupted last time,
now it's a good time to tell you

219
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:23,802
the reason why. I suspect Mr. Hiromatsu.

220
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,238
He killed Ohkubo

222
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,506
Did you?

224
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,274
No. I didn't!

225
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,377
First of all, you were the
first ome to find the victim

227
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:38,316
There's a possibility that the murderer
Ieft his belongings at the crime scene...

229
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,186
But if he pretends that he is
the first person to find the victim,

231
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,622
then he can make an excuse.

232
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:46,625
Saying that these things
were there when he found the victim!

234
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,260
Yeah. but...

235
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,930
Second of all...you left
the murder scene to get the ambulance...

237
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,499
You know, people usually don't do that...

238
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,970
Perhaps,
u left for some other purpose. didn't you....?

240
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,106
What's that supposed to mean?

242
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:03,542
I or example...

244
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,445

245
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,463
Sakurada...Um?

246
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,415
The murder weapon was found?

247
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,317
Yes sir. I'm pretty sure. sir

248
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:18,490

00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,325

255
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,332
Kami-Takada bridge?

256
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,034
Oh, that's a bridge located

257
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,803
between this murder site and the hospital...

258
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,273
So, the reason why you
headed to the hospital was...

260
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,343
not to call the ambulance...

261
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,282
but to dispose of the murder weapon!

262
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:48,320
Give me a break! Why would. I
have to kill him in the first place!

264
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,654
As to that, I already have a clue!

265
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:51,923
What?

266
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,659
You said you are a
comedian but not popular at all...

268
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,363
You knew Mr. Ohkubo
was Mr. Mizuhara's manager.

270
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:05,570
And you knew-he visited Mr. Mizuharaloften
so you begged him to give you a job...

272
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,707
You got mad. and then...

Wait, held on...

275
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,478
And you know what!?

276
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,481
The dying message the victim
Ieft is telling that you are the murderer!

278
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,882
Dying message?

279
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,751
What is it?

280
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:25,557
It's how Mr. Ohkubo died. Wasn't it strange?
Smiling with a peace sign...

282
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:30,362
That was the dying message'?

283
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,564
Exactly, that was the murderer's name!
Iivu

286
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,133
Take a look!

287
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,075
Smiley Peace?

288
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:48,546
I knew you were a comedian but
I didn't know that your stage name was this

290
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,783
Yeah, but I didn't Kill him!
Believe me. Mr. Takagi!

292
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,819
Hey. what about his alibi?

293
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,254
Oh, alibi?

294
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,826
If Mr. Ohkupo-was killed at 4-40,
then I was still in my apartment...

296
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,296
I left t ere a little before 5:00

297
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,916
It was: right after
I started jogging when I found the victim!

299
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,435
I wish you-could prove-that.

300
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:15,807
Yeah, but how can you prove
that a man living alone was in his room?

302
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:19,210
Oh. I remember. after Mr. Ohkubo left

303
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:24,315
I set thesalarm clock and went to bed

304
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,450
Then, I heard the sound of.

305
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,452
the toilet flushing from the room next to Mine.

306
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:31,973
And that was 4:40, right
Mr. Mizuhara?

308
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:33,224
I think so.

309
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,460
Now you have an alibi. Hiromatsu!

310
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,095
Yeah!

311
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,863
What's. that look on his face?

312
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,701
Sorry... May I go home now?

313
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,835
Um'!?

315
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,754
Ohkubo was like a father to you.

317
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:48,173
You must be shocked.

318
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,642
I think you're done with Mizuhara. right?

319
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:56,064
Elk I will have to see you
some other time, but today. yes...

321
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:01,186
Uh...May I go home too?

322
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:05,724
I haven't asked you about the situation
when you found the dead victim. have I?

324
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,627
Ha ha ha...You're right.

325
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,864
Yeah, Uh ha...

326
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,532
Are you sure'?

327
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,135
Got it! Thanks.

328
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,207
Bad news. The alibi you stated is invalid.

329
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,207
Huh?

331
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,375
What the!

332
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:28,779
IL knew you were hiding something.
So I had my officers investigate: this:area.

334
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,450

Hiromatsu.

00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:56,274
Well how could I tell you the truth?
I could've been arrested for the murder!

344
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,308
So that was a lie out of « ésperation. huh?

345
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:00,612
That's why you had a strange -
Iook on your face.

349
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:08,086
Maybe that was Mr. Mizuhara's
Imagination? I don't know.

351
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,154
But that was totally
out of blue that he said so...

354
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:13,491
So it was just a coincidence
that you lied about your alibi

358
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:14,993
Is that what it is?

359
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:19,097

373
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,931
Mr. Mizuhara knew the name,
only because they were neighbors. right?

377
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,900
I haven't seen Mr. Mizuhara on TV lately,

378
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,670
But he used to be on
a lot of TV shows. eh...

380
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,807

397
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:36,908
t's about the conversation Mr. Ohkubo
had with Mr. Mizuhara.last. night

400
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:40,178
Oh, you mean the future
plan about Mizuhara's career.

402
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,381
Yuan, Mr. Takagi wants to know
more about this future plan in detail.

404
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,987
OK. so this future plan means...

405
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:56,361
ORR 1 AOORR RYO een
what the dying message means!

407
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:57,996
And

408
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:02,050
The real murderer is that person!

409
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,576
Ms. Yasunaga? You-mean. the-female-owner
ofatheaproduction company?

411
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:15,947
Yeah. She told me to tell you this b cause
she thought it might help to solve the case.

413
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:20,718
The future plan means smile

414
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,254
Smile?

415
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:28,660
We sold Ryoji Mizuhara as 1 cool handsome
actor that never smiles

417
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,996
But that style doesn't work any more...

418
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:36,434
So, Ohkubo told him about switching
to a handsome actor with warm smiles

420
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,504
That's why he visited me last night...

421
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,244
I agreed with that plan,
beeause Mlzuhara looks so sexy

423
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,614
Switching to a smiley actor?

424
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,350
Yeah! But I'm pretty
sure that Mr. Mizuhara...

426
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,653
was surprised since
hclw.as told so out Of the luc

428
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,390
Umm, he was me angry
than surprised. I think, because...

430
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,960
he was suddenly toldste be an acter
than was totally opposite...

432
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,529
what he used be. right?

433
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,464
Oh no!y

434
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:11,569
Also, Mr. Ohkubo treated Mr. Mizuhara
as if he were his own child: I heard

436
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:15,907
Ohkubo had a sickness actually...

437
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:16,941
What?

438
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:20,311
The doctor told him that he
had only 6 months more to live

440
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,114
SO HO Alexa oO
been resting in the hospital

442
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,351
but he refused, and worked hard instead,
just to make his boy Mizuhara

444
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:31,356
make a great comeback on TV once again,
while sacrificing his life.

446
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,292
He did it all for Mizuhara.

447
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,461
Sacrificed his life.

448
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,799
Then, I think I got the meaning
of the dying message!

450
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,434
Really?

452
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:48,373
Yeah, If my deduction is correct,
then this case is a really sad one.

454
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,860
Right. This is not a funny. case at ll
Not.at all.

456
00:16:56,448 --> 00:17:00,284
What is this? Why are you calling
everyone to the murder scene?

458
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:05,823
Listen Mr. Sakurada,
Hiromatsu did not murder Mr. Ohkubo!

460
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,375
The murderer is somebody else

461
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:09,694
First of all, about the
disposal of the murder weapon!

463
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,531
After the murder, the killer fled
from here as ou cansimagine

465
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,867
But which way did he/she run away?

466
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:20,671
Iva.
KamrTakada bridge, where the
weapon was found. is that way...

469
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:26,144
414 )
Then, the murderer ran that way too?
Not necessarily...

472
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,247
Maybe he went that way!

473
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:34,052
Criminals try to divert police attention
opposite the direction that they flee.

475
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,921
Very simple trick though.

476
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:41,092
I see. The real murderer is
someone 1a -siwvingarounc ere...

479
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:46,247
Wait a second Mr Mizuhara. your
apartment as tnaswvayd Isn't It'?

481
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:47,615
Yeah.

482
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:50,233
Second of all, about establishing the alibi...

483
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:52,437
Perhaps this criminal
act was a compulsive one.

485
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,238
Perhaps this criminal act
as a compulsive one.

487
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,675
Thus, the murderer was not
well-prepared! I assume.

490
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,845
But that person camo up with 1 good idea.

491
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:04,816
You lied about your alibi
out of desperation. right?

493
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,052
The true murde er tried to use that lie

495
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,837
I don't get. it

496
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:14,192
Fy «>»
Don't you remember? There was one
person who was drawn into your lie...

500
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,529
Rv oft Mizuhara!
Yes...

502
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,313
You murdered Mr. Ohkubo!

504
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:23,401
You murdered Mr. Ohkubo!

505
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:23,801
You murdered Mr. Ohkubo!

506
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:27,637
+ then heard the sound of flushing toilet
from the room next to mine.

509
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:31,476
That was neither your imagination
nor misconception, right?

512
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,094
By saying so.

514
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,396
you tried to fabricate your
alibi that you were in your room

517
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:35,646
you tried to fabricate your
alibi that you were in your room

520
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:35,930
you tried to fabricate your
alibi that you were in your room

523
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:36,230
you tried to fabricate your
alibi that you were in your room

526
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:36,514
you tried to fabricate your
alibi that you were in your room

528
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,082
you tried to fabricate your
alibi that you were in your room

531
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:43,820
Last night. «Mr. Ohkubo made a suggestion
about the futurezplan of your career

533
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:47,091
It was about switching your character
from a smileless one to a smiley one

535
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:52,864
But (you had "lways liked being a cool,
handsome actor that didn't smile

538
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,601
Mr Ohkubo s suggestion
was nOflbdwé) of? your options

541
00:18:56,602 --> 00:19:01,305
And then you thought Mr Ohkubo was
gonna force you to change your character

543
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,108
No way! Am I wrong?

544
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:11,382
Huh...I'm Ryoji Mizuhara. You think'l am
gonna laugh like a teenage brat?

546
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,218
Mizuhara,
You murdered OhKubo?

548
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,889
This morning. after he left your apartment.

549
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,957
You followed Mr. Ohkubo...

550
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,805
Huh=?You are darn right, Mr. Takagi.

551
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:40,044
But then, why did the victim die In
such a strange way Explain that?

553
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:44,682
Of course, as you thought,
that was a dying message

555
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:49,153
But it wasn't "Smiley Peace". It
was smile and "V(Victory) sign.

557
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:55,126
It was Mr. Ohkubo=s last message to you.
Whom he treated like his own child.

559
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,897
R. Ohkubo said to you...

560
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:04,302
Mizuhara:,: senile
mile Is your new' style.

562
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,704
You.look'amazing when you smile

563
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,211
I did't how that.

564
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,745
This can't be true!!

565
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,515
Who in the world would encourage
someone that's actually trying to kill you?

567
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:19,750
But there are people like that

568
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:26,724
That's how much
Ohkubo,cared about Mizuhara

570
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,393
He deeply cared about you.

571
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,363
Idn't you know, Mizuhara...
He had only 6 months left to live?

573
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,865
But he decided to
sacrifice. his valuable time for you.

575
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,755
Mr. Ohkubo!

577
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,310
Mr Ohkubo was thinking about
you until the last moment of his life.

580
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:52,116
You should pay for your crime
and live right for him. Mr. Mizuhara.,

582
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:58,256
Alright
Let me hear your story in the station, ok.

584
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,525
Mr. Sakurada!

585
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,627
Huh?

586
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:06,831
Could you...
Please, apologize to Hiromatsu!

589
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,099
Huh!?

590
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:15,573
Please, apologize that you suspected
Hiromatsu Yes. he did lie about his alibi...

592
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,842
And lying Is not a good thing...

593
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,977
But. it's partly your fault because you put

594
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:23,481
too much pressure on him
so that he had to lie!

596
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:28,019
Am I wrong, Mr. Sakurada?
Suspect the first man who finds the victim.

598
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,421
It is the basics of investigation...

599
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:35,259
But there's a flaw that people
tend to ignore in this principle too...

601
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,396
This applies not only to you, but me as well

603
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:42,767
That is:.[police officers
must be free from prejudice!

605
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,770
No matter what!

606
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,772
I'm sorry

607
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,206
I was wrong.

608
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,175
Uh, no
It's OK.

611
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:58,382
