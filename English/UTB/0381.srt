H. Helji?

238
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:25,170
Ah, hey you.
You're not allowed at the murder scene...

240
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,638
Now...

241
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,509
the forensic officers are done
searching the murder scene; right?

243
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,110
Well. yeah...

244
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:37,549
The victim 18 the owner of a
toy production company,

246
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,185
Kenji Tsujiya. 53 year old

247
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:44,122
He worked and also lived here

248
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,027
The estimated time of death was the
29th of last month, Sunday. around 5 pm.

250
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:54,231
The dead body was found on the
30th. Monday. around 10 am...

252
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,568
Who found it?

253
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,971
Four workers in this company found it

255
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,306
Four workers...

256
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,378
These four workers always come a
Iittle early in the morning.'and

258
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:11,182
eat breakfast in a coffeehouse down there,
then come to the office together...

260
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,851
I see. That's why it's four people .

261
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,755
- OK, and these four workers
found their boss.

263
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:21,126
Who was tied with a rope and
beaten-to death with a golf.club.

266
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,062
How.do you know. Helji?

267
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,532
You see the ink spot
around the victim's back?

269
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,332
Yeah.

270
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:34,089
Perhaps, the ink spilled over
when they were fighting...

272
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,442
But the murderer\didn'tscare and
just tied the owner up with a rope.

274
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:42,047
I saw the marks of the rope
all over the floor

276
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,650
So I thought he was wriggling on the floor
with his hands tied behind him.

278
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:47,118
Ok, but what about him being beaten
with a golf club

280
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:50,121
Ae, [one AE Xs =Aoxonrge Got [ox=ilinge) [ox=r=§g=1m
with a golf club?

282
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,891
I saw the blood on his had

283
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:57,662
Andralso, see the thin marks
on-the floor near his head?

285
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,731
These are from iron clubs

286
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,702
T Yo m rderer missod
the head and hit the floor

288
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,837
when he or.she was beating the owner
who was lying on the floor.

290
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,975
But why did the murderer tied him up first,
andfthen clubbed him?

292
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:13,510
I think the murderer wanted to get the
combination to the safe... .Look!

295
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,714
You see the safe over there?

296
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,231
It's left open...

297
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,084
I see...

298
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:21,853
Some outsider committed the murder
for the money. is that it?

300
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,522
\ "don't know whether
it was an outsider or not...

302
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,292
But it's certain that the.murderer
tied the president up first

305
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:32,464
And THEN
the murderer clubbed him to death,

307
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,000
because the president saw his or her face.

308
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,069
Something like that, right Inspector?

309
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:39,354
Ah . Yeah.

310
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,241
Hey. are you gonna be alright.:Dad?

311
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:43,707
Hmm?

312
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,177
The boys are dominating
this deduction battle!

314
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,178
Oh, are the ?

315
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:48,913
Well. it's not a hard thinguto do

316
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,248
With this scene«of murder.

317
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,783
Cven a policeman can
make a deduction likeuthis

319
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,518
Oh. thanks...

321
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,589
This isn't everything, right?
We must'vergot something else .

323
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,255
What?

324
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,974
Hey! Let it out!

325
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,794
Oh, alright

326
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,601
We found these on the floor
around the victim's deadibody.

328
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,470
These four building blocks

331
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:17,709
TY A 200 RO ORC TR x) DOE VY
near the Ictims dead bod .

333
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:23,915
Actually, we found the victim's fingerprints
and also ink on those four blocks.

335
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,183
Ink!?

336
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:29,921
If you look at the ink: spotted side
of each building block

338
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,399
Nd this is the last one...

340
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:44,601
Omoecha To ?

341
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:46,321
Omocha To 7?

342
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,315
M1 Lilt

343
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,316
Omocha To 7

344
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,286
No. Is it Omogchiya (Rice cake store)

345
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,588
I think it's Omochiya, doni you think ?

346
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,491
Right

347
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,926
If 1it really means "omochar,
then whoever made this

349
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,159
could've picked the
other block to spell it right...

351
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,196
We. Inspector}

352
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:16,000
Can you tell me specifically where
the four blocks in the pictures were?

354
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:16,735
Sure...

355
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,235
Sure

356
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,221
This 18 how it looked when
e found the dead bod

358
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:22,841
guess this guy is he

359
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:28,646
Yeah.... He's the victim the president of this
toy production company. Mr. Tsujiya...

361
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,651
From the stack of the building blocks
by the victim's dead body.

363
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,856
We found the four blocks with characters
'mo. chi, and "ya".

365
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,592
Each of them had the victim's fingerprints
and an ink spot on it...

367
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,579
The Ink spots on the blocks

369
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:50,401
and the one that's on the victim's back
came from the same bottle...

373
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:56,307
The problem is, who put the Ink spots
on those four building blocks...

375
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,375
Right...

376
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:01,045
We found the victim's fingerprints
on those blocks but...

378
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,984
it.could be that the murderer made the
president hold them to hide something.

381
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:07,851
What

383
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:12,223
These are really the only ones that
have the owner's fingerprints?

385
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:17,061
Ah, actually the fingerprints are
on some other blocks.

387
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:21,666
But we found that
these four blocks have fingerprints

389
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:26,738
all over them. I mean on every single side,
even on those characters.

391
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,042
So. I guess+itys possible to think that

392
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,446
those four blocks Ar Sa
the owner's dying message

394
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:39,050
What? What makes you think that?

396
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,469
of the murder scene.

397
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,253
Hmm ?

398
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,255
His"hands are tied behind his back. right?

400
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:50,795
You can hardly sce and touch anything
if your hands are-tied like this...

402
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,532
Uti) ug Xe (Glo Y30 Er Of CVO
«Single side of the four blocks

404
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,037
because the victim was
searchingafor the correct blocks

406
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,340
by reading them with his fingers
e touched some other blocks.

408
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,875
But notso: many fingerprints were
found fromsthem.

410
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,345
Think that's because
each block is designed to have

412
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,897
five characters in the order.

413
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,981
So it's not so hard to
find which one's which.

415
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,567
I 888 .

416
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:15,920
That's why we found so many fingerprints
particularly on the four blocks.

419
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,058
In fact
Fingerprints are made of sweat and skin oil

421
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,327
and that's why they remain on things.

422
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,196
But once people die,
these things stop coming out

424
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:29,384
So even if you try to leave
fingerprints of a dead body.

426
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:31,069
You ¢an only get one or two solid ones...

427
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,875
Perhaps, when the murderer wasn't looking,
this guy took the four blocks

429
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,979
with his hands tied behind his back.

430
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,582
And then, rolled his body and
put the ink on those blocks.

432
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:49,187
And then, he rolled his body back again
to put them back to where they were.

434
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,925
I'm sure his hands were full of sweat
becausc of fear of death,

437
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:59,464
As a matter of fact the marks of the rope
all over the floor prove that.

439
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:00,999
So it's possible to think that...

440
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:06,404
The feeling of danger actually made
the owner choose the wrong block

442
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,073
This Is a to production compan .

443
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,076
If you think logically
the-dying message-must be "omocha

445
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,012
Rather:than "omoechiya. don't you think?

446
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,015
Oh my god. We just got here

447
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,450
How could you come up with
SO many things in such a short while

449
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,786
Yeah, I know, eh?
That's my bo

451
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:22,987
Oops .

452
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:28,459
This.isn't good, Ran!
He's dominating us mentally!

454
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,095
This is a battle between Heiji and us!

455
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,331
It's either the baseball game
or Takarazuka show!

457
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:33,731
Y. yeah!

458
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:34,198
Y. yeah!

459
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:34,532
Y. yeah!

460
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,068
To win this deduction battle,

461
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:41,172
we gotta find out what the
dying message really meant first.

463
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,376
Maybe there are some hints
in the other toys

465
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,379
No, we found no strange toys
other than the blocks.

467
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:49,380
Are: ou sure?

469
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:55,019
We checked every single toy in this office
Iooking for some other dying messages

471
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,889
that could be hiding

472
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,895
Then! ma be he d ing message
hasta different meaning

474
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,363
What do you mean?

Different combinations of

00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,840
Ugh! Doesn't make sense at all!

480
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,760
Alright. what else have we got?

481
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:26,351
/we found only a golf club andi
Ieather coat with the victim's blood on it.

483
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,785
BE TT
we found only a golf club and; in
Ieather coat with the victim's blood on it.

486
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,555
We found only a golf club .and a
Ieather coat with the victim's blood on it.

488
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,558
Which we assume the murderer was
wearing during the 'murder.

490
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,565
But the golf club and the leather coat are
the victim's belongings.

492
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,301
So they didn't help us
determine who killed him...

494
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:47,739
What's more confusing is that
the murderer was wearin ¥that leather coat.

The murderer,may have touched it

You haven't found gloves
or something like that. right?

509
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,497
Speaking of blood...

510
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,299
there's a strange bloodstain right here!

511
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,035
Where is it?

Hold: on:a sec!

00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,710
You have to look at it really close .

You sec tho part whoro
the bloodstain ends unnaturally?

Hmm!?

00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:37,320
Yeah

It's external input only,

00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:59,644
So then... Maybe a video camera was
here until the victim was murdered.

533
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,247
The video camera was
in the president's room.

if there's any bloodion it. will ya?

Itgs strange...Let's assume that
the video camera was here"...

539
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:15,059
But why would the murderer move it
after killing the owner?

541
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:19,030
The murderer connected the video camera
to the TV just to watch the president

543
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,765
after tying him up?

544
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:23,818
No. then why did he remove it?
The owner was dead.

00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:37,915
Theres something odd
something unnatural

554
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,851
Hey. Conan...

555
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:42,320
Hey!'What's up. Ran?

556
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,722
Could you do me a favor?

557
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:45,323
What?

558
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:50,261
I really want Kazuh1 to win
this deduction battle...

560
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:55,333
I think she i1s really looking forward to see
the Takarazuka show with us. 7

562
00:18:55,951 --> 00:19:00,488
So, next time you come up with a good idea
omwsomething. I want you to tell us quietly.

564
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,906
VERN
I'll give Dad your Ideas

566
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:06,577

Conan, please

572
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,256
Hey hey hey!

573
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,327
This idiis mine!

574
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,197
So stop headhunting:-him will you?

575
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:35,039
Hey! Of course. you respect a guy's
friendship more than one with girls. right?

577
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,908
Friendship?

578
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,510
I'm en your side only
because ou ga e me no choice .

580
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:41,846
Ah, doesn't matter. man!

581
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:46,050
We gotta: win. this the: battle anyway
We got &.watch the final game!

583
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,768
Oh. what a guy

584
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:51,305
Oh! How was the identification?

585
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,190
We found it...

586
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,925
We found the victim's blood
even though it was very slight

588
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,927
I guess the murderer did not realize it

590
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,447
But why was the,video camera
herelanyway?

595
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,699
Perhaps the murderer connected
the camerarto the TV

599
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,200
And watched-the owner until
he spit out the combination to the safe...

601
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,770
and,watched the owner until
he spit out the combination to the safe

603
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,373
Yet.
Why do something round about like that?

605
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,793
Why not just tie him up and
wait in front of the safe

607
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,378
intil he spits out the combination?

608
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:19,116
He left the video ¢cmera on,
to keep him from moving around

610
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:22,420
because he was ransacking
the other rooms!

612
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:28,426
As a matter of fact, the murderer didn't
know the victim left a dying message...

614
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:32,897
Well. now it more likely that
the murderer 1s well acquainted

616
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,567
with this office and also with the victim
What do you say?

618
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,070
The president left a d. Ing message

619
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:42,139
So that means,
If we get it night it's possible to find out

621
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,474
who the murder is...

622
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,478
Then, we should investigate the
four workers who found the dead body.

624
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,481
Oh, Takagi is asking them
about their alibi right now.

626
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:51,749
Inspector Megurel

627
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,017
Yeah?

628
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,685
Just finished the interrogation!

629
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,155
Ok. And . how was it?

630
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,393
They are all designers

631
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:06,230
but also do some other types of work,
Iike NaoAikQ; whw does accounting.

633
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:09,233
June 29th around 5 pm,
when the murder occurred.

635
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,668
She was out fishing alone.

636
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,873
Atushi Hasami, the salesperson,
as watching a movie at home.

638
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,410
Isao Nakagami,

640
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,680
Hajime Iw1tomi,
the vice president,

642
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:26,384

of a golf tournament

All very vague alibis

648
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,790
Yes... Right now,
Chiba is verifying their stories and

650
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,791
Iifthere is anything hiding
behind the stories.

652
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:36,127
It seems nobody Is able to
prove:their alibi. Not even one.

654
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,128
Hiding

655
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,046
Behind .

656
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,267
Wait 1 minute... If the situation was...

657
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,537
That dying message on the four blocks Is...

658
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,548
Ohman it was so easy)

659
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,785
How come I didn't realize this?

660
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,790
