between two people

Ran won in a shopping mall lottery.

We are heading toward
Chinatown in Yokohama.

52
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,102
Circumstances led to us
having dinner with them.

54
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,304
But. suddenly...

55
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,384
Mr. Kawabata died.

56
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:36,589
Poison was not found in his clothing.

57
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,659
Because chemical reaction was found
on the plate and towel that he used

59
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:46,499
Pops who sat beside him was
suspected of planting cyanide.

61
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,902
This is ridiculous!

62
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:53,572
Why do I have to kill 2a man
I met for the first time

64
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,108
at a restaurant I came for the first time?

65
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,811
What you say sound suspicious already!

66
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,680
What's superb timing for your daughter
to be asked to appear in the movie

68
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,716
at a restaurant you came
for the first time!

70
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,084
True!

71
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,886
We came to this restaurant

72
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,554
Just by coincidence...

73
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,890
Ahhh

74
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,798
Are you all right? You look pale.

76
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,369
I'm okay. I was just a bit dizzy.

77
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:26,305
Why don't just sit over there.

78
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,674
Uncle will solve the case soon.

79
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:31,677
Yeah. thanks.

81
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,381
We're in trouble

00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,917

Ran looks really sick.

84
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,821
We need to take her to a hospital soon.

Chinatown: Deja vu in the Rain-Part 2

86
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:58,037
Anyway, the killer replaced
that poisoned towel...

88
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,440
After the soup was spilled, and
the victim changed seats. that means...

90
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:07,913
You were sitting to his right
at that time and are the prime suspect!

92
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,515
Hey. hey...

93
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,016
Hey. Inspector...

94
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:11,417
what?

95
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,751
Umm Ra...

96
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,285
Inspector!

98
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:19,992
This bottle believed to have contained
the poison was found in the restroom.

100
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,893
What!

101
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:28,400
I see... the towel was brought into the
restroom and laced with the poison...

103
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,802
That's why. it's not me!

104
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,573
In that case, Uncle Kogoro
IS not the culprit!

106
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:35,307
What?

107
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,712
Cause Uncle hasn't been to the
washroom since he arrived here!

109
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,448
So that's why, Inspector!

110
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:47,786
Mr. Kawabata changedseats, holding
his towel he used to wipe the soup off.

112
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:54,160
That's why, nobody
could have switched towels...

114
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:59,798
No. there must be something to wait...
a way to switch without people noticing...

116
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,537
I see!

117
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:10,009
The killer used the rotation
of the turntable!

119
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:17,750
The cyanide-laced towel is placed at the
edge of the turntable and it is rotated cleverly

121
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:21,987
It can fall right in front of Mr. Kawabata!

122
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,290
How's that!

123
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,759
Even if you say "How's that"...

124
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,663
If something like that falls, everybody
will find it strange. right?

126
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:34,500
So. that's why it has to be done cleverly
SO Nobody notices...

128
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:39,572
If nobody sees it, the speed with which
the turntable has to turn

130
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:43,943
to drop off the towel would
make all the plates fall off, too!

132
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:51,116
In the first place, who'd use such
a towel when you have one yourself?

134
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:54,052
Ha. ha... you're right!

135
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:55,888
Wait...

136
00:05:56,423 --> 00:06:00,359
I remember when I tried to
get the soy sauce and the chili oil...

138
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,562
The turntable rotated so many times,
that they were hard to get...

140
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:08,133
The order of the dishes that
were placed.on the turntable was...

143
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,768
in the clockwise direction...

The soy sauce was between the

164
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,522

twice cookeed pork and the steamer lid.

At that time. the order of the seats was...

169
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,862
Starting with the victim Mr. Kawabata,
In the clockwise direction,

171
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:45,004
Me. Ran. Mr. Kitaura,
Mr. Ito, Mr. Isogami, and Pops...

173
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:49,475
And the soy sauce went back in front
of Pops again and again...

175
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:53,312
And the chili oil went
back in front of Mr. Kitaura...

177
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,982
Oh, yes, Mr. Kawabata said...

178
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:04,590
Actually, I'm allergic to eggs
and hate even the sight of it...

180
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,927
even the sight of it

181
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,735
Okay, work on this area with caution.

182
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:17,236
Yes. sir!

183
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,406
Excuse me. officer!

184
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:20,939
Yes?

185
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,509
There's something I'd like to ask you...

186
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,244
What's that, kid?

187
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,112
If you checked the food...

188
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,916
you must have checked the plates and
the top of the table as well, right?

190
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,117
Yeah...

191
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,786
Then...

192
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,324
So you checked places like there right?

193
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,659
No. not yet...

194
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:45,230
Then, Uncle Kogoro is
asking you to check it right away!

196
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,033
What? You mean Sleeping Kogoro?

197
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:53,105
Yes, also, did you find anything
funny on the towel with cyanide?

199
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,374
Huh? You mean other than the cyanide?

200
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,314
Oh, yes! Yes, there was
a light brown stain!

202
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:06,251
I sniffed it. and that's soup for sure!

203
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,954
You must have seen it, right?

204
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:13,192
Mr. Kawabata spilled the soup on his
jeans and wiped it with the towel. right?

206
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,661
It's a stain from the spill...

207
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:16,895
Anything else?

208
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,298
You found nothing else?

209
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,134
Oh. no . nothing special...

210
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,939
Really... nothing else... right?

211
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,776
Then, I'll tell that to Uncle Kogoro!

212
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:31,944
Oh... okay...

213
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,146
I was right.

214
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:39,118
Mr. Kawabata was not killed by switching
his towel with the poisoned one...

216
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,254
The towel was switched
after he was killed...

218
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,792
By that person...

219
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,297
If that is right, the evidence
must still be there...

221
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,767
On that table...

222
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:02,808
Anyway...

223
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,845
The killer is the one who laced his own
towel with cyanide in the restroom

225
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,749
and switched it with the
victim's towel at the table!

227
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:17,523
Yeah... without attracting the attention of
Rang Conan and me sitting on both sides

229
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,827
But how... how can you do that...

230
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,896
Oh. that's how!

231
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,698
All three suspects are In
the movie industry!

233
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:31,437
Maybe he used an invisible line used In
special effects to move the towel...

235
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,904
For goodness's sake...

236
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,681
They've got to turn
down the air conditioning!

238
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,317
What is it, Inspector Yokomizo?

239
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,954
Well... there's something...
I heard from my brother...

241
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:55,159
Kogoro Mouri makes bizarre comments?
At first. but it's only to fool people...

243
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,231
His attitude changes abruptly with a
weird voice and dance...

245
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,734
As if a spirit takes hold of him

246
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,101
A whole entirely different person...

247
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:08,907
But. of course. he can be exaggerating...

248
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,545
Is that what you mean ..7?

249
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,483
By a weird dance...?

250
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,350
What?

251
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,590
So. enough joking around...
Now, I would like you to take your seats...

253
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:29,561
At the same table the crime took place.

254
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:37,101
There was Mr. Ito,
Mr. Isogami and Mr. Kitamura...

256
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:44,943
Then, I'll be able to tell you everything...
hat happened during dinner...

258
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,847
It's happening!
The Sleeping Kogoro detective show!

260
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,487
First, I would like to have Inspector
Yokomizo take a seat where the victim sat.

262
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:03,028
From his right, in the exact same seating
arrangement, there's me and Mr. Isogami,

264
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,431
+2 Mr. Ito and Mr. Kitaura...

266
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:11,870
Next, at Ran's seat,
I'd like another police officer...

269
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,739
'  ~r@
Humm™ Why?

274
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,442
hh... my daughter is and feeling to we

279
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,311
I'm all right!

280
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,781
I can do it.

283
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,286
Ran...

284
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,858
And Conan sits
between Ran and the victim...

286
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:43,068
Now that all the seats are taken,
I would like to hear an exclamation...

288
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,471
of a mysterious incident that took place
immediately before the crime...

290
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,440
A mysterious incident?

291
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:54,046
Yes, the table! Somebody was moving the
turntable, trying to give me a hard time!

293
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,646
What?

294
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:55,847
Look!

295
00:11:55,848 --> 00:12:00,319
Do you see the bottle of soy sauce on the
turntable right in front of Uncle Kogoro?

297
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,385
Yeah...

298
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:05,123
I moved the turntable
to get the soy sauce...

300
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,391
Each, time I tried to get it.

301
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:11,163
It will return/immediately in front of
Uncle. No matter how many times I do wt

303
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:16,068
The same thing happened with the
chili oil in front of Mr. Kitaura!

305
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,404
Each time the bottle came close to me...

306
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,874
We It would go back to where
It was right away...

308
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:27,145
This means that someone was having
fun, giving me a hard time. night?

310
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:33,518
Hey, Mr. Detective... Is what the kid is
saying related to the crime?

312
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,722
H-hey... don't...

313
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:39,758
It's all right...

314
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:40,892
What?

315
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,365
Uncle Kogoro said we don't have to do
anything for the culprit will expose himself.

317
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,500
Expose... himself. ?

318
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,537
Here you are, little boy. Your bun"

319
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,573
Wow! Thank you!

320
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,509
Hey why now?

321
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:05,417
Oh... yes. Detective Mouri ordered
Chinese bun for this little boy...

323
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,686
Thank you! First. a big bite!

324
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:09,921
Don't eat it!

325
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,459
What is it, Mr. Isogamir

326
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:19,564
Somebody got killed just
now at this table! VY

328
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,467
Poisonamight still be
found somewhere on the table!

330
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:26,071
And you allow a kid to
eat with his hands here?

332
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:31,009
But. the forensics have already checked
and did not find cyanide anywhere...

335
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,845
Mr. Isogami is right...

336
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,948
There might still be cyanide...

337
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,653
Somewhere... where we cannot see...

338
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,396
Hey!

339
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,032
Don't fool around with me!
Get to the point!

343
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,070
Who's the culprit=and™
where's the cyanide!™

346
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,305
How would you turn it?

347
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:01,139
What?

348
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,275
The turntable...

349
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,445
How? Of course,
you placeryour hand like this...

351
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:06,778
How? Of course,
you place:your hand like this...

353
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:14,152
What would you do if plates are crowded
Iike this egg and crab dish and the pitan?

355
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:20,459
Well, in that case...

356
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,462
Ill pick up the edge
of the turntable withimy fingers...

358
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:26,898
It can't be...

359
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,868
The cyanide is under the turntable?

360
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:37,008
No. wait There are a lot of problems
here making the victim touch this...

362
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:42,180
What is Mr. Kawabata
didn't like these two dishes?

364
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:42,881
What?

365
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,918
What is Mr. Kawabata ¢
didn't like these two dishes?

367
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,123
Is that right?

368
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:55,193
Y-yes. . Mr Kawabata
was allergic to eggsO.

370
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,563
Now, Inspector Yokomizo. please check!

371
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:02,701
Right in front of you,
seated at the victim's chair...

373
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,103
are the two dishes.

374
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,205
Now. where is the chili oil?

375
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,710
In-in front of-Mr. Kitaura...

376
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,645
Yes: of course!

377
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,615
That's why. when the, kid
tried to get the chili oil.

379
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,917
The turntable was returned
to the original position!

381
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,853
The victim would try to
avoid the two dishes 'and

383
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:25,590
hold the table to moving
around, again and again!

385
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:32,063
It might be true for the chili oil But this
time. the soy sauce is in front of the kid.

387
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,401
Why then did the table turn when he
tried to get the soy sauce?

389
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:40,906
To get the victim to touch the cyanide, you
have to get the cyanide on that spot, right?

391
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,811
In addition, the cyanide must be applied
immediately before the Peking duck is served

393
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:49,514
a dish you have to eat with your fingers

394
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:55,821
If you do that eailier, somebody might
touch it accidentally

396
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:02,394
Then, when the kid tried to get the soy
sauce, he had not applied the cyanide yet?

398
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:03,328
Right...

399
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:07,566
Most probably, the culprit tried to apply
cyanide on the underside of the turntable

401
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,268
where the two plates were placed

402
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,170
when the waiter could be seen
bringing the Peking duck.

404
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,006
He couldn't apply the cyanide and
turned the turntable again and again,

406
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,042
because Conan would rotate it.

407
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,010
Y-you mean...

408
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,213
the person who had the two plates

409
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,849
in front of him when-the soy sauce
was in front of you is the...

411
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:24,883
Yes...

412
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,352
That person...

413
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,689
Killed Mr Kawabata...

414
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,491
Here... tonight!

415
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,461
Mr. Isogami!

416
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,668
Then, what was that
towel with so much cyanide?

418
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,305
That was Mr. lsogamrs towel...

419
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:52,277
He brought the towel to the restroom, poured
cyanide on it, and returned to his seat

421
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:57,349
He applied the cyanide on that spot...

422
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:02,687
In the chaos that ensued when
Mr. Kawabata lost consciousness...

424
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,323
He switched towels...

425
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:11,096
To make sure nobody notices the switch,
he drenched his own towel with soup...

427
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,733
He wanted to make the
towel look identical to

429
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:18,336
Mr. Kawabata's towel after
he wipe the soup of his pants, but...

431
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:25,543
You missed one small point...
that Mr. Kawabata was wearing jeans!

433
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:33,084
Es... on Mr. Kawabata's
towel that you switched...

435
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,588
Along with the soup stain...

436
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,392
There was a blu stain from his jeans!

437
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:49,134
I get wt... if that towel is night
In front of Mr Isogami.

439
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:54,306
That is proof that he is the killer!

440
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:58,543
No... that towel is not proof enough...

441
00:17:58,945 --> 00:17:59,411
Why

443
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:05,016
There is the possibility that the towel was
placed there to frame Mr. Isogamu...

446
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:10,088
But, you will confess,
won't you? Mr. Isogami?

448
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,926
When Conan touch the place with
cyanide just a while ago...

450
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:20,065
And he tried to eat the bun with
those hands. you stop him...

452
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,237
There is enough conscience left in you...

453
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,979
Conscience...

454
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:53,298
If that guy who let Rika die had a bit of
conscience, I wouldn't be doing this...

456
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,769
Rika? You mean the girl
who died a year ago . ?

458
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,704
But. that was an accident during the shoot...

459
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,942
It was no accident!

460
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,214
That was full-fledged murder...

461
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:15,687
That Rika took over the stunt in the
Iast scene from the stunt pro...

463
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,923
Kawabata knew about it all along...

464
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,526
R-really!

465
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:29,267
He told me that he made her wish to
do it on her own come true

467
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:35,406
He said the movie became a hit, thanks
to her. grinning that evil grin...

469
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:39,411
We had so many opportunities to stop that...

470
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:49,287
F) ('U f
B-but why? The diretor snubbed her
for:being such a ham...

474
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,290
You're still green...

475
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,194
A director's job is a sad one...

476
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,231
When you keep on I coking at the
actress through the camera lens,

478
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,867
You fall in love with her...

479
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:11,108
No matter how amateurish... or uncouth

480
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:17,115
You'll never get to direct a film,
If you don't understand that.

482
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:19,918
Okay. let's go...

483
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,053
We'll talk to you at the station...

484
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:32,297
Mister Detective, I'm sure you had
already wiped off the cyanide...

486
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:37,068
But. what were you planning if I had
pretended not to know and let him die?

488
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:42,107
If I was a man like that scoundrel?

489
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:46,878
Then, I was planning 10 say something
different to corner you...

491
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,416
And stop you from
trying to make excuses...

493
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:55,553
I wanted to see that!

494
00:20:56,155 --> 00:21:02,493
I have a gripe to whoever gave
melthis thing called conscience...

496
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:10,401
As a film director, I most certainly wanted
to see you interrogate ruthlessly...

498
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:15,473
I'm not the one to believe in a god...

499
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,142
God...

500
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,746
Is there a god in this world?

501
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:24,249
That voice... Who?

502
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:28,920
That calm voice of a woman... Who is it?

503
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,656
Ran?

504
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:33,625
Rain...

505
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,595
The noise of the rain is fading...

506
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,564
Is that okay?

507
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,300
I can hear

508
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,802
Should there be a reason?

509
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,641
Should there be a reason?

510
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,710
Is there a god?

511
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,512
Your Japanese?

512
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,483
The angel did not smile at me.

513
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:00,985
Get out!

514
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,387
Not even once...

515
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:04,522
Sharon.

516
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,393
Yes . that time

518
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,428
I met her.

519
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:13,231
