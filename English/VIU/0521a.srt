1
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:31,162
Hey, are you all right, Conan?

2
00:00:32,362 --> 00:00:33,962
I'm fine.

3
00:00:33,962 --> 00:00:37,362
I drank the cold medicine that Dr. Agasa gave me.

4
00:00:37,362 --> 00:00:39,562
But, your voice sounds terrible.

5
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:40,662
I think it's better we head back

6
00:00:40,662 --> 00:00:43,262
and I take care of you at home.

7
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:45,262
He'll be just fine.

8
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:49,362
That wonder drug that was given to the brat a while ago,

9
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:51,362
will soon cure him.

10
00:00:51,362 --> 00:00:54,362
What wonder drug?

11
00:00:54,362 --> 00:00:57,962
Hey, don't tell me it's that Chinese liquor called Baikaru

12
00:00:57,962 --> 00:01:00,962
that you brought with you

13
00:01:00,962 --> 00:01:04,562
when you first visited my detective agency?

14
00:01:04,562 --> 00:01:05,562
No, no.

15
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:09,562
It's medicine that's way more effective than liquor.

16
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:11,062
Right, boy?

17
00:01:12,662 --> 00:01:14,862
I wonder if the person

18
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:16,562
that we're going to see is really okay.

19
00:01:16,562 --> 00:01:18,462
"Mr. Heiji Hattori" -Because it said in the letter

20
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:20,162
that he wanted to talk to Shinichi.

21
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:21,962
Isn't the person going to be disappointed

22
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:23,662
if he finds that Shinichi's not with us?

23
00:01:23,662 --> 00:01:25,662
Really?

24
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:28,062
Yes, something about that person

25
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:30,162
finding that Shinichi made a mistake in deducing

26
00:01:30,162 --> 00:01:32,162
a murder case that he solved a year ago.

27
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:33,662
So the person wants to meet him and talk about it.

28
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:37,062
That's why, in consideration of that mistake in deduction,

29
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:42,862
we're going to reinvestigate the case and reveal the truth.

30
00:01:42,862 --> 00:01:45,562
Well, I mailed Shinichi.

31
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:48,462
So he just might decide to show up.

32
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:52,762
Shinichi might come?

33
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:56,762
But, why would the guy send the letter to you?

34
00:01:56,762 --> 00:02:00,862
Of course because I'm Shinichi's best friend.

35
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:04,362
Well, even if he did try to contact me by mail or phone,

36
00:02:04,362 --> 00:02:07,562
I'm not living here now anyway.

37
00:02:07,562 --> 00:02:08,862
So, he probably got impatient

38
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,062
and decided send mail to high school detective Heiji Hattori,

39
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:12,962
since he's in the same profession.

40
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:15,762
But, what's this about a mistake in deduction?

41
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:17,862
If I'm not mistaken the sender was...

42
00:02:17,862 --> 00:02:20,062
It's a letter from a man called Makoto Okuda

43
00:02:20,062 --> 00:02:22,362
who lives in a place called East Okuho Village

44
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:24,962
on the outskirts of Okuho-cho.

45
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:25,962
You know him, don't you?

46
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:28,862
Yes. I think it's the young man who helped us

47
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:31,362
when we investigated the murder case

48
00:02:31,362 --> 00:02:34,262
that occurred in that village.

49
00:02:34,262 --> 00:02:36,162
Do you have a cold?

50
00:02:36,162 --> 00:02:40,162
Well, I'll take the letter that's addressed to you

51
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:42,662
that's enclosed together with mine when I go over,

52
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,662
so read it well, okay?

53
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:46,362
"Shinichi Kudo" -I'll bet it's filled with foul remarks

54
00:02:46,362 --> 00:02:48,162
about your deduction,

55
00:02:48,162 --> 00:02:52,562
but it'll be great stimulus to get rid of that cold of yours.

56
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:54,562
The only case I can recall

57
00:02:54,562 --> 00:02:56,662
that occurred in East Okuho Village is...

58
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:59,262
A mistake in deduction?

59
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,962
It sure bugs me.

60
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:05,062
A crisis is gracefully revived.

61
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:07,062
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

62
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,262
Shinichi loses his memory and is not himself.

63
00:03:09,262 --> 00:03:11,362
He cannot deduce the case together with Heiji.

64
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:13,062
He sees through the one and only truth.

65
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:14,962
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

66
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,062
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

67
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:56,706
"Murderer Shinichi Kudo"

68
00:04:58,206 --> 00:05:00,906
What? His whereabouts is unknown?

69
00:05:00,906 --> 00:05:02,106
Are you serious?

70
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:03,206
"Residents Division" -Yes.

71
00:05:03,206 --> 00:05:06,406
A missing persons search was out for him six months ago.

72
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:10,006
Well, Makoto always wanted to go to the city anyway.

73
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:11,006
"Makoto Okuda (19)" -The villagers say

74
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:13,806
that he probably left home for the city

75
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:16,406
and is part-timing or something there.

76
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:19,906
And? What do you want with Makoto Okuda?

77
00:05:19,906 --> 00:05:22,806
I got a letter from him last week.

78
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,506
It said that he wants to talk

79
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:26,106
about the deduction mistake that was made by Shinichi Kudo

80
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:28,006
when he solved a murder case

81
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:30,406
that occurred in this village a year ago.

82
00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:32,306
Who?

83
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:35,506
He asked me to bring Shinichi Kudo.

84
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:42,406
What this?

85
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:44,606
Liar!

86
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:48,806
You're friends of that liar, right?

87
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,006
Liar?

88
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:51,806
Hey, Sonny.

89
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:53,806
At any rate,

90
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:56,806
if you want to know about the case, go to the village police box.

91
00:05:56,806 --> 00:06:00,006
We have nothing to tell you people.

92
00:06:02,006 --> 00:06:04,906
What the heck did that high school brat detective do anyway?

93
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,906
Ran, haven't you heard anything from Shinichi?

94
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:08,906
No.

95
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:11,806
Where's Conan?

96
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:15,206
That brat said that he'd head off for the inn ahead of us.

97
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:17,606
I guess his cold got worse.

98
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:20,106
I'm going back to the inn too then.

99
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:22,206
I don't want to leave him there alone.

100
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:24,306
Well, I guess the truth is he didn't want to go there

101
00:06:24,306 --> 00:06:28,306
and have to face me pointing out his deduction mistake.

102
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:32,906
Dear Mr. Shinichi Kudo,

103
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:36,706
I've found evidence that there was a mistake in your deduction.

104
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:40,006
I suggest that we should talk things out just the two of us,

105
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:41,906
so you can save face as a detective.

106
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:43,906
I'd like to see you at the mountain hut

107
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:45,606
where we both first ran into each other.

108
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,106
Makoto Okuda.

109
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:56,406
Excuse me.

110
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:00,606
The cold medicine that doctor got me

111
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:03,006
isn't making me feel better at all.

112
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:06,906
Are you Shinichi Kudo?

113
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:10,206
His voice is changed.

114
00:07:10,206 --> 00:07:11,306
Who is it?

115
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:18,406
The door is locked.

116
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:21,706
Hey, wait! Hey!

117
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:23,106
Darn, my throat...

118
00:07:23,106 --> 00:07:25,606
I've lost my voice because of this cold.

119
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:28,306
The window...

120
00:07:29,806 --> 00:07:31,006
and door as well...

121
00:07:33,506 --> 00:07:35,306
I've got to find an escape route.

122
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:40,906
This thing I'm feeling...

123
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:42,006
It can't be...

124
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:46,606
Doctor, did you see the bottle of medicine

125
00:07:46,606 --> 00:07:48,706
that I had way inside the drawer?

126
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:52,006
You mean that cold medicine.

127
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:54,106
The container was that of cold medicine,

128
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,106
but the content is the medicine that I made.

129
00:07:56,106 --> 00:07:57,106
What?

130
00:07:57,106 --> 00:07:59,706
Don't tell me you drank it?

131
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:01,906
No. Well...

132
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:08,906
Bummers.

133
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,506
I've got to get out of here fast.

134
00:08:11,506 --> 00:08:16,406
What? It was a prototype anecdote for APTX 4869?

135
00:08:18,906 --> 00:08:20,206
Yes, that's right.

136
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:22,306
I made it thinking to secretly try it on him

137
00:08:22,306 --> 00:08:25,006
when he comes to spend the night here next time.

138
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:26,206
That medicine was the miracle drug

139
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,506
that could maybe change his body that had become that of a child

140
00:08:28,506 --> 00:08:31,706
to the body of a high school student that it used to be.

141
00:08:31,706 --> 00:08:33,806
You've got to call him quick.

142
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:36,406
If he transforms into his original body in front of everyone,

143
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:37,906
we can't afford that to happen.

144
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:02,806
Conan is not back at the inn yet?

145
00:09:02,806 --> 00:09:05,406
No. I asked a villager

146
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:06,706
and was told that he saw a boy wearing glasses

147
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:09,906
go into the forest alone.

148
00:09:09,906 --> 00:09:13,006
Then, why don't you call him on his cell phone?

149
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:14,106
"Out of service"

150
00:09:14,106 --> 00:09:15,306
No good.

151
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:17,306
This place is out of service range.

152
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,406
What the heck is he doing?

153
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:21,806
And Conan has a cold too.

154
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:24,406
That troublemaker.

155
00:09:24,406 --> 00:09:26,006
Sorry, officer.

156
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:28,606
We'll go to the site of the murder later.

157
00:09:28,606 --> 00:09:31,206
Okay, see you later then.

158
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:38,306
Conan!

159
00:09:38,306 --> 00:09:40,306
Where are you?

160
00:09:40,306 --> 00:09:42,806
Come on out!

161
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:44,106
Don't tell me that he...

162
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:46,606
that something was written on that letter addressed to him,

163
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:49,406
and he was summoned to go to some strange place?

164
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:51,506
Hey, did you hear about it?

165
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:52,606
What's up?

166
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:55,706
A stark naked man was afloat in the lake.

167
00:09:55,706 --> 00:09:57,406
Yes. I heard.

168
00:09:57,406 --> 00:10:00,306
My mom just took a blanket over.

169
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:01,906
Hey.

170
00:10:01,906 --> 00:10:04,206
It wasn't an elementary school kid, was it?

171
00:10:04,206 --> 00:10:05,506
No.

172
00:10:05,506 --> 00:10:06,706
It was a young man,

173
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,406
probably a high school student or something.

174
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:10,706
-High... -High school student?

175
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,206
Over there, over there.

176
00:10:17,206 --> 00:10:19,606
It's that man wrapped in a blanket.

177
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:39,106
Shinichi?

178
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,406
Shinichi!

179
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:45,406
Why? Why are you here, Shinichi?

180
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:49,106
Shinichi...

181
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:53,806
Is that my name?

182
00:10:53,806 --> 00:10:55,306
Shinichi?

183
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:08,696
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

184
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:12,521
You're the high school detective of the East, Shinichi Kudo.

185
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:15,821
Talking funny like that isn't making anybody laugh.

186
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:17,221
Detective?

187
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:20,221
Don't tell me that Shinichi...

188
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,221
Lost his memory?

189
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:24,221
I don't know

190
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:28,221
who I am or where I am.

191
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:35,221
Shinichi?

192
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:39,421
Hey, isn't this the guy, Shinichi Kudo?

193
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:42,021
If so, we shouldn't have rescued him.

194
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:43,821
Hey, watch your mouth.

195
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:47,321
Could you lend me something to wear?

196
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:49,921
I don't seem to have any clothes on.

197
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:53,021
Okay. I'll lend you my clothes.

198
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:55,621
Talk about a voice hoarse from a cold.

199
00:11:55,621 --> 00:11:58,221
Just like Conan.

200
00:11:58,221 --> 00:12:01,221
That's right, we've got to find Conan quick.

201
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,721
No, I don't think we need to worry about him.

202
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:10,821
Well, the thing is...

203
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:13,621
What?

204
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:16,021
He took the train and left for home?

205
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:17,621
All by himself?

206
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:18,621
Yes.

207
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:20,021
I'd completely forgotten that he told me so

208
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:23,921
before we went to the town office.

209
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:25,421
He said he didn't want his cold to get worse,

210
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:27,421
so he wanted to go on home.

211
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:31,521
But, there's nobody back at the office.

212
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:32,821
I'm sure that he told me

213
00:12:32,821 --> 00:12:35,221
that he was going to stay over at old man Agasa's place

214
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,621
or something.

215
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:39,321
What's your problem talking like that?

216
00:12:39,321 --> 00:12:42,621
I said I just simply forgot.

217
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:47,421
At any rate, this place is out of service range,

218
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:50,021
so if we want to check on the whereabouts of that brat,

219
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:53,021
we've got to go back to the inn where there's a phone.

220
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:54,921
We're taking this troublesome detective brat

221
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:57,921
that forgot everything with us too.

222
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,921
Forget about trying to put sense back into him.

223
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:04,821
I'm sure he met the you know what in the forest.

224
00:13:05,821 --> 00:13:08,421
-You know what of the forest? -What a scare, scare...

225
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,621
Hey, hold it you!

226
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:13,721
What do you know about the forest?

227
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:38,021
You look pretty good in Heiji's clothes.

228
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:40,421
Don't you think so, Ran?

229
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:41,621
Where's Ran?

230
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,721
It seems that Ran's more worried about the glasses brat

231
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:48,121
than that high school detective.

232
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:51,421
What? You gave me the wrong medicine?

233
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:55,221
Don't tell me you gave me the medicine

234
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:57,021
that the little lady made at the school festival?

235
00:13:57,021 --> 00:13:59,221
Yes, that's right.

236
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:01,821
It's the antidote for APTX 4869

237
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:04,521
that shrunk Shinichi's body.

238
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:06,221
In other words, it's a drug that will return his body

239
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,321
to that of a high school student that he originally was.

240
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:12,021
I mistook that drug that Ai made for cold medicine

241
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:14,621
and carelessly gave it to you.

242
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,421
I mean gramps, careless is not the word for it.

243
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:17,421
By the way,

244
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:20,421
is it true that Shinichi has lost his memory?

245
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:23,421
Yes, it seems he doesn't remember anything.

246
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:27,221
Well, I guess it's better for him that way, though.

247
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:29,821
I mean with his original body from here on now,

248
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:32,321
it'll be more convenient for him and all I guess.

249
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:34,021
Stupid.

250
00:14:34,021 --> 00:14:36,321
That drug is only a prototype.

251
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:38,321
There may be a slight discrepancy

252
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:41,921
but the longest the effect will continue is more or less 24 hours.

253
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,321
Twenty four hours?

254
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:46,221
You've got to make sure he regains his memory by then

255
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:47,621
or else we're in big trouble.

256
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:49,321
Why? If it's his memory,

257
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,121
we can work on it slowly after he becomes small again.

258
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:54,621
What are you saying?

259
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:57,221
If two people get amnesia at the same time,

260
00:14:57,221 --> 00:14:59,621
no matter how dense, it'll be more than obvious

261
00:14:59,621 --> 00:15:01,921
that the two are one and the same.

262
00:15:01,921 --> 00:15:03,921
Especially her.

263
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:05,021
True.

264
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:06,221
If that should happen,

265
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:08,921
I'm sure she'll find out

266
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:13,521
what's going on no matter what.

267
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:15,521
About who made him drink the drug and for what.

268
00:15:15,521 --> 00:15:17,021
I wonder if she'd be able to hold the truth

269
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:20,421
that she finds out about all within herself?

270
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:22,721
Well, in order not to corner her

271
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:26,121
into a dangerous predicament like we're in,

272
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:28,421
will you please bring him back here

273
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:30,721
before he turns back into a child again?

274
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,321
I'll take care of everything else here.

275
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:35,221
Okay, you can count on me.

276
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:39,021
Heiji, what's all the whispering about?

277
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,521
Please put me on the phone.

278
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:42,521
They hung up.

279
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:43,921
What?

280
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:47,021
Well, I was told that he drank medicine

281
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:49,021
and is fast asleep so not to worry.

282
00:15:49,021 --> 00:15:50,721
Okay.

283
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:53,821
Okay then, let's eat dinner too and hit the sack right away.

284
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:56,521
After all, we've got to back to Beika-cho tomorrow.

285
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:59,121
I thought we were going to take it easy

286
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:00,521
and stay for 2 nights and three days?

287
00:16:00,521 --> 00:16:02,021
The schedules been changed.

288
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:04,921
We've got to get Kudo to a doctor as soon as possible, right?

289
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:09,821
Let's take Shinichi to that murder site too then.

290
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:12,121
He may just remember something.

291
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:14,121
What the heck are you talking about?

292
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:16,321
Wait.

293
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:18,121
Maybe she's got a point there.

294
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,250
My god, what a mess!

295
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,750
The entire house is messed up.

296
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,850
"Officer Shiroyama (46)" -The room was left as is, since the incident,

297
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,650
in keeping with his wishes.

298
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,850
His?

299
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,650
Daiki who was staying over at a relative's house

300
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:50,050
and escaped disaster on the night of the incident a year ago.

301
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,950
He's the brat that we ran into at the town office.

302
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,150
Then, the two people who are in the picture on both sides of him are...

303
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:00,550
Daiki's parents who died because of that incident.

304
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,950
He's Mr. Takinori Hinohara, who was the village head back then

305
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,150
and his wife, Shoko.

306
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,750
Mr. Hinohara was a very cheerful person

307
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,150
"East Okuho Village Office" -and was liked by all the villagers.

308
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:17,650
He served as village head for more or less 20 years or so.

309
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,650
Therefore, that disaster that struck a year ago

310
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,650
really broke the hearts of the villagers.

311
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,350
And this is the aftermath of the incident?

312
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,450
These black footprints.

313
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,450
Yes. This is...

314
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,150
the blood of Mrs. Hinohara who was stabbed part way down the stairs

315
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,650
and stepped on by the murderer

316
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,450
which after he seems to have walked around the room

317
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,550
with his shoes on, leaving footprints behind.

318
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,250
How terrible.

319
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,150
These shoe prints continue on quite a long way

320
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,150
over to that veranda.

321
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,550
It sure is a spacious veranda.

322
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,250
The shoe prints return back from here.

323
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,750
I see.

324
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,250
So, the village head was made to fall over from here.

325
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,550
And? What about the murder weapon,

326
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,450
or was anything taken?

327
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,750
The knife that was the murder weapon wasn't found in the house,

328
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,250
but the jewelry and antiques were gone.

329
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,850
The only thing left behind were the bloody shoe prints.

330
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,550
The same shoe prints were found going from the back door

331
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:29,150
to the asphalt outside and then back.

332
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,350
Are you sure that those were the only shoe prints?

333
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,350
Yes.

334
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,450
It was raining until the day before the incident

335
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,850
and the ground was muddy, you see.

336
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,650
Which means that the armed robber after killing Mr. and Mrs. Hinohara,

337
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,750
made off with the jewel and valuables in the house

338
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,850
and fled by car.

339
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,950
And? Who did Kudo say the murderer was?

340
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,350
Don't tell me that he branded an innocent citizen

341
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,850
to be the armed robber.

342
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,850
No, well the thing is...

343
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,050
Double suicide.

344
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,850
Shinichi Kudo there deduced this case to be

345
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,050
a forced double suicide that Mr. Hinohara committed.

346
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,950
Forced double suicide?

347
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,350
By the way, who are you, young lady?

348
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,750
I'm the classmate of Makoto

349
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,350
who was staying over at this house after his parents passed away.

350
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,550
See, he's in that picture over there too,

351
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,250
behind the village head.

352
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,850
Hold it.

353
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,450
Makoto, you mean Makoto Okuda?

354
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,050
"Moegi Hikawa (19)" -Yes, that's right.

355
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,950
He, Makoto Okuda, discovered the corpses

356
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,950
and was the first to be suspected of being the murderer.

357
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,950
Well, on the day the murder was committed,

358
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,250
Makoto was staying over at a hotel in the city

359
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,950
to take the entrance exam for a university,

360
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,450
so he was cleared immediately.

361
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,950
And let me ask you,

362
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,150
where's that Makoto now?

363
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,050
He's the one who sent a letter asking for me to bring Kudo here

364
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,850
because he found that Kudo had made a mistake in deduction.

365
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,050
Yet his whereabouts are unknown?

366
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,350
What the heck is going on?

367
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,550
His whereabouts are not unknown.

368
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,750
He's probably been killed.

369
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,050
What?

370
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,450
Just what do you mean?

371
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,550
The people of this village say that Makoto is part-timing in the city,

372
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,450
but since he was adopted by this family,

373
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,750
he probably inherited a huge.

374
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,950
So, you're saying that somebody who wanted to take that money from him.

375
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,550
Yes. It's unthinkable

376
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:32,350
that Makoto would not get in touch with anyone for half a year.

377
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,750
Besides, the one who killed him

378
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,450
is probably that thing in the forest.

379
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,850
That thing in the forest?

380
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,550
If so, who for what reason sent me a letter like that?

381
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:49,050
What the heck is Kudo's deduction blooper?

382
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:52,350
The motive for Mr. Hinohara committing forced double suicide

383
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,550
was because his doctor declared that he had cancer

384
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,850
and he was full of despair.

385
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,050
The problem arose

386
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:02,350
when Mr. Kudo publicized the truth a year ago.

387
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,550
Who are you?

388
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,550
"Misato Kawauchi (36)" -I'm a reporter for Tohto News,

389
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,050
Misato Kawauchi.

390
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,450
I'm sorry,

391
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,350
I helped myself in because the door wasn't locked.

392
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,850
And? So, what was the problem?

393
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,850
Some days later,

394
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,950
a nurse at the hospital let it out with a slip of her tongue.

395
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,850
She told him that although he did have cancer, the tumor was benign

396
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,150
and it would be completely cured with surgery.

397
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,650
Hearing this, the he seemed very happy.

398
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,950
What?

399
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,550
Hey, Kudo. What the heck is going on?

400
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,550
Explain.

401
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,250
Kudo.

402
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,250
I don't know... I don't know anything.

403
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,450
I don't know what's going on.

404
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,750
Kudo.

405
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,350
I see.

406
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,150
I finally got it.

407
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,450
I understand now why the villagers don't like this detective kid.

408
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,550
Yes.

409
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,850
He's a horrendous villain who disgraced the village head

410
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,950
who was loved by everyone.

411
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,350
But, how frightening.

412
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,750
If that's true it means that the murderer

413
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,950
is still out there somewhere, right?

414
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,950
There's a rumor going around among the villagers

415
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,850
saying it's that you know who in the forest that's done it.

416
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,050
Hey, I heard that just a while ago.

417
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,250
But what the heck is it about?

418
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,150
Is there something in the forest?

419
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,550
It's folklore that's been relayed for generations in this village.

420
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,050
Folklore?

421
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,450
I remember frequently being told the folklore

422
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,150
when I was a child too.

423
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,450
I was told not to look at its eyes if I run into in the forest.

424
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,650
That if you don't look away, you'll be cursed

425
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,650
and become prey to Death.

426
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,650
Death?

427
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,950
What is it, Ran?

428
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,050
It's nothing.

429
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,750
I just felt a bit weird.
