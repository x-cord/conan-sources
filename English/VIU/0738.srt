1
00:00:11,313 --> 00:00:15,613
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

2
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:19,413
Right, my business is looking for the faults of others.

3
00:00:19,413 --> 00:00:22,213
In order to console a heart that is battered by such a job,

4
00:00:22,213 --> 00:00:27,013
most detectives have their own secret pub that they frequent.

5
00:00:27,013 --> 00:00:28,313
Awesome!

6
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:33,113
This shop where the youths noisily play pool and darts

7
00:00:33,113 --> 00:00:36,413
is unfortunately not my kind of pub,

8
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:38,713
but the bartender here being my client,

9
00:00:38,713 --> 00:00:40,413
I've got no choice.

10
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:43,013
Here you go, Mr. Detective!

11
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:45,313
Drink this for the time being.

12
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:48,913
Her name is Yuzuki Fukui, age 26.

13
00:00:48,913 --> 00:00:51,313
The bartender for this shop.

14
00:00:51,313 --> 00:00:54,013
I'm sure she likes me.

15
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:55,413
As proof of that,

16
00:00:55,413 --> 00:01:00,613
she's treating me to this light green cocktail, Gimlet.

17
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:04,413
I'm sure she sees me as

18
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:07,613
a double of that detective, Phillip Marlowe.

19
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:11,913
This is green tea?

20
00:01:11,913 --> 00:01:13,013
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:15,213
I figured you wouldn't be able to work if you got drunk, you see.

22
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:16,713
Well, it's okay.

23
00:01:16,713 --> 00:01:19,913
Let me start over again.

24
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,313
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

25
00:01:23,313 --> 00:01:25,413
This is a pool bar where my client

26
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:27,413
who is a bartender here is working.

27
00:01:27,413 --> 00:01:29,213
The thing that relaxes my heart is

28
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:32,513
the off-beat jazz music playing in this shop and...

29
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:34,113
Hey, Pops.

30
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:36,113
The voice of a brat.

31
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:41,513
Huh? Why're you here?

32
00:01:41,513 --> 00:01:43,913
Because Ran told me to come and get you

33
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:46,713
before dinner gets cold!

34
00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:49,213
I told you I'm here on business!

35
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:50,213
So you say,

36
00:01:50,213 --> 00:01:53,513
but she said that all you're probably doing is drinking.

37
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,013
I'm here on business, right? It's a difficult case!

38
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:57,413
Yes, sort of.

39
00:01:57,413 --> 00:02:00,413
-See, like I told you! -What kind of case is it?

40
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:03,013
I hear strange sounds when I'm working.

41
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:05,113
A popping sound like that of the cork of a champagne bottle

42
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:07,313
when it's opened.

43
00:02:07,313 --> 00:02:11,313
A sound like when the cork of a champagne bottle is removed?

44
00:02:25,113 --> 00:02:26,713
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

45
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,613
are slashed by the light of deduction.

46
00:02:28,613 --> 00:02:32,613
Pool Bar Blue Parrot Liquor summons the case.

47
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:34,213
He sees through the one and only truth.

48
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:36,213
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

49
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:38,813
His name is Detective Conan!

50
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:12,793
"Kogoro is at the Bar (Part 1)"

51
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:18,093
See, just like that sound.

52
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:19,193
Maybe it was just

53
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:22,093
the sound of the cork of a champagne bottle being removed?

54
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:24,193
But back then,

55
00:04:24,193 --> 00:04:27,293
I didn't serve champagne to any of the customers.

56
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:31,093
Maybe a customer snuck a bottle in?

57
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:33,393
Wine bottles also have corks.

58
00:04:33,393 --> 00:04:35,193
I thought so too,

59
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:38,493
so I watched the customers closely.

60
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:40,093
But there were no customers

61
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:42,093
drinking champagne or wine at that time.

62
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:43,593
After I heard that sound,

63
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:46,593
I also heard the sound of something falling.

64
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:49,193
I looked for it after closing when I was cleaning the shop,

65
00:04:49,193 --> 00:04:52,393
but found no corks.

66
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:55,093
Only... I smelled something strange.

67
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:57,493
A strange smell?

68
00:04:57,493 --> 00:04:59,593
Don't tell me it was the smell of something that explodes,

69
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:01,093
like gun powder?

70
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,993
No. It smelled like yuzu.

71
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:06,993
Although it was very slight,

72
00:05:06,993 --> 00:05:09,793
since the kanji character "yuzu" is in my name,

73
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:12,793
I've always been sensitive to the smell.

74
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:15,193
Since we don't use yuzu in this shop,

75
00:05:15,193 --> 00:05:16,793
I thought it was strange

76
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:19,393
and decided to discuss it with you, Mr. Mouri.

77
00:05:19,393 --> 00:05:24,693
Maybe a customer spilled a citrus drink that smelled similar?

78
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:27,493
You know, like the gimlet that uses lime juice.

79
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,693
The screw driver and white lady, likewise.

80
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:34,693
I thought it was the smell of yuzu, though.

81
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:37,093
Did you hear that sound several times?

82
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:40,093
Yes. 2 or 3 times on different days.

83
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:41,593
Are there any customers here today

84
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:43,993
that have been here every time you heard that sound?

85
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:47,693
Yes! They're the ones at the table right behind us.

86
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:50,193
That foursome!

87
00:05:50,193 --> 00:05:52,393
Then, here goes.

88
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,293
Okay, cheese!

89
00:05:55,793 --> 00:05:58,693
Department head, I've run out of film.

90
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:00,593
Don't worry, no problem.

91
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,693
I've got two or three spare films myself, too.

92
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:07,193
I had a lot of spares bought for me.

93
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:08,593
Right?

94
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:10,993
Yes.

95
00:06:10,993 --> 00:06:13,193
-Mr. Kogure, here. -Okay.

96
00:06:13,193 --> 00:06:18,393
But, isn't it a hassle using analog cameras in this day and age?

97
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:22,193
I hate digitals!

98
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:23,893
Remember...

99
00:06:23,893 --> 00:06:25,993
there was one guy in our department too, wasn't there?

100
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:27,493
The one that used to say, "I'm at home with digitals",

101
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:30,693
that geek, who was no good at work.

102
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:32,793
You mean Mr. Yoshikuwa?

103
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,793
Yes, Yoshikuwa.

104
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:36,493
If you get totally hooked on digitals like him,

105
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:38,493
you'll soon lose track of what's real and what's not.

106
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:41,293
And end up being cooped up,

107
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:44,893
then eventually hang yourself to death!

108
00:06:46,393 --> 00:06:48,693
Come to think of it, it seems that

109
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:51,693
you were getting it on with that guy, Ms. Kishiura.

110
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:53,693
But if you're lonely with no boyfriend,

111
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:56,893
you can count on me to give you a good time, you know?

112
00:06:56,893 --> 00:06:59,393
No, I don't think so.

113
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:02,093
Come on, don't be that way.

114
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:04,193
It's between you and me...

115
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:06,093
Yes, Mr. Usuda!

116
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,993
What is it, Hatsumura?

117
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:11,793
I got you the billiard cue that you asked me to get for you.

118
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:14,293
I found a super high grade ebony base model

119
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:17,293
for a super low price, you see.

120
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:20,093
Is that right? Thanks, Hatsumura.

121
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:22,693
It's a fantastic gift.

122
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,693
A gift?

123
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:28,693
It's my birthday present, isn't it?

124
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:31,093
Yes.

125
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:34,593
I bought you something, too! Your own darts, Mr. Usuda.

126
00:07:34,593 --> 00:07:39,393
Although there were a lot of soft plastic darts around,

127
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:43,893
these hard steel darts were really tough to find.

128
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:45,893
I see. Is that right?

129
00:07:45,893 --> 00:07:48,793
You guys are really efficient, after all!

130
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:53,593
Of course, I meant to give it as a gift to you, Mr. Usuda!

131
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:58,993
Kogure, do you know why I wanted the steel darts?

132
00:07:58,993 --> 00:08:00,493
No.

133
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:02,593
It's because...

134
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:11,393
I can't make you panic with plastic darts,

135
00:08:11,393 --> 00:08:13,693
like I'm doing now. Can I?

136
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:20,493
It seems the pool table's open now!

137
00:08:20,493 --> 00:08:24,593
Since you went out of your way to get the cue for me,

138
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:26,693
I guess I may as well try it out!

139
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:33,093
Anyway! Go on home and tell Ran,

140
00:08:33,093 --> 00:08:36,493
that Pops Kogoro got a request to solve a difficult case,

141
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:39,193
and won't be home for a while.

142
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:40,993
So, Yuzuki my dear,

143
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:42,993
won't you please make me a Gimlet?

144
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:46,293
What? Are you sure you can do your job drinking?

145
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,893
I'll be fine, fine.

146
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:51,593
Don't blame me for what may happen later.

147
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:59,693
Pops! Let's go home, already!

148
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:01,893
Ran was really pissed, you know!

149
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:03,393
Come on, shut up!

150
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:04,993
Coming back time and again.

151
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:07,793
Can't you see that I'm working?

152
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:10,893
All you're doing is drinking!

153
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:14,093
Yuzuki my dear, another Gimlet, please!

154
00:09:14,093 --> 00:09:17,493
Please think it out like you should now!

155
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:18,893
Once this mystery is solved,

156
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:21,593
I'm planning to upload it on my blog, you see.

157
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:25,793
Don't you worry, because the mystery is almost solved.

158
00:09:25,793 --> 00:09:27,293
Is that so?

159
00:09:27,293 --> 00:09:28,993
No joke?

160
00:09:28,993 --> 00:09:32,593
The perp probably spilled some lime-vinegar.

161
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:35,293
Moreover, the kind with yuzu in it.

162
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:37,393
Yuzu lime vinegar?

163
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:38,793
Hey.

164
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:41,693
In other words, that is...

165
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:44,593
That is?

166
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:47,493
That is yuzu and lime.

167
00:09:47,493 --> 00:09:50,693
Yuzu and lime! Like so.

168
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,193
-It's got the pop and all, see! -He's wasted.

169
00:10:00,193 --> 00:10:03,293
So, Mr. Usuda's fallen asleep.

170
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:07,693
Yes, he's a weak drinker and yet he wants to drink.

171
00:10:07,693 --> 00:10:09,793
Talk about bummers,

172
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:13,593
that billiard cue cost 100,000 yen.

173
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:16,493
The darts, case and all that I got for him

174
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:17,993
cost me 60,000 yen too.

175
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,893
You're lucky, Kishiura,

176
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:22,193
that you only had to buy him 5 to 6 cases of film, right?

177
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:23,893
I told you, didn't I?

178
00:10:23,893 --> 00:10:26,193
That he asked me to buy him the poster of an idol

179
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,993
through internet auction for his birthday.

180
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:31,693
Come to think of it, you were giving it to him at the company.

181
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:34,293
It cost me 30,000 yen, autograph and all, you know!

182
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:36,593
May I take a look at it?

183
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:38,193
Don't get it dirty, you know,

184
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:40,293
'cuz Mr. Usuda's going to get at me if you do.

185
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:43,193
I know!

186
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:45,193
Yoko Okino.

187
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:48,593
Okay then, shall we have another drink before leaving?

188
00:10:48,593 --> 00:10:50,193
I guess so.

189
00:10:50,193 --> 00:10:52,093
All you've been doing is making the drinks,

190
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:54,093
so you haven't been able to drink much, have you?

191
00:10:54,093 --> 00:10:55,993
Come to think of it,

192
00:10:55,993 --> 00:10:59,593
I feel like all I've been doing was crushing ice with this.

193
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,593
Then how about another one of the first champagne that we drank?

194
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:05,093
Yes! That was good.

195
00:11:05,093 --> 00:11:07,593
-What do you say? -Fine with me.

196
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:10,793
Excuse me! A bottle of champagne, please!

197
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:13,693
-Right away! -And three glasses, too!

198
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:17,593
That person at the counter, isn't he Kogoro Mouri?

199
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:21,293
No joke! You mean that renown detective?

200
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:24,093
I somehow feel like I'm being watched.

201
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:25,593
I want to take a picture of him!

202
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:27,393
Maybe he's just a look alike?

203
00:11:27,393 --> 00:11:30,293
I guess so. I don't think he'd be such a drunkard.

204
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:37,993
I'm not at home with things like this after all.

205
00:11:37,993 --> 00:11:41,893
Hey, hey! Don't face it towards me!

206
00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:44,093
Mr. Kogure, please.

207
00:11:44,093 --> 00:11:46,693
When it comes to jobs requiring strength, you can count on Kogure!

208
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:48,793
Yes, yes. Please leave it to me.

209
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:54,093
What's with this? It's really tight.

210
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:57,093
Hey! Don't face it this way, you know!

211
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:59,093
I know.

212
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:05,993
-It's bursting out! -Stupid!

213
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:08,393
It's splashing on the poster!

214
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:10,493
I really heard that sound.

215
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:13,093
That was champagne just now, wasn't it?

216
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:15,193
The edge of the poster got wet!

217
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,693
Shoots!

218
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:20,093
Excuse me, please bring us three hot towels!

219
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:21,393
Yes!

220
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:32,893
How about the sound of the package of the hot towels being opened?

221
00:12:32,893 --> 00:12:37,093
Is it different from the sound you heard?

222
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:40,493
The sound of the cork being removed

223
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,493
sounds closer to what I heard after all.

224
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:47,393
Hey! Some have flown onto Mr. Usuda, too.

225
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:49,393
What? Shoots!

226
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,693
What's that?

227
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:53,893
There's something that looks like a red dot on Mr. Usuda's neck.

228
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:55,393
True.

229
00:12:55,393 --> 00:12:59,393
Rather, he's not breathing.

230
00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:02,193
Don't tell me...

231
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:04,893
Mr. Usuda...

232
00:13:10,193 --> 00:13:11,893
Mr. Usuda!

233
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:13,693
Are you all right?

234
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,793
Hey, what's up?

235
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:18,393
Mr. Usuda's not moving as if he's dead!

236
00:13:18,393 --> 00:13:20,293
What?

237
00:13:21,793 --> 00:13:25,293
It's not as if he's dead,

238
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:27,893
he's really dead.

239
00:13:32,865 --> 00:13:36,465
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

240
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:38,765
I got a job request from a woman bartender

241
00:13:38,765 --> 00:13:40,865
called Yuzuki Fukui, who's in love with me,

242
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:44,465
and came to the pool bar where she works.

243
00:13:44,465 --> 00:13:48,465
But the one that refuses to let go of me, wasn't her.

244
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:51,365
But rather, the case.

245
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:55,365
Unless we do any autopsy, we can't tell for sure

246
00:13:55,365 --> 00:13:57,865
but the cause of death is most likely, suffocation

247
00:13:57,865 --> 00:13:59,065
due to nerve poisoning.

248
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:00,865
Poisoning?

249
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:04,465
Yes, from this wound behind his neck.

250
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:05,665
It seems that a sharp object

251
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:08,665
such as an eyeleteer laced with poison, was poked in.

252
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:11,165
But, if he was poked with such a thing,

253
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:13,765
he would've shouted or made a scene I'm sure.

254
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,665
I think he died falling asleep.

255
00:14:16,665 --> 00:14:20,765
-What? -Because the victim seemed wasted.

256
00:14:20,765 --> 00:14:22,865
Well, so it's you again?

257
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:25,165
Yes, sir, Mr. Inspector!

258
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:29,165
Don't tell me that you coincidentally happened to be here again?

259
00:14:29,165 --> 00:14:31,965
Yes. It is indeed that coincidence again.

260
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:34,965
Yes, detectives have the duty of confidentiality.

261
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:36,365
No matter what the circumstances,

262
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:39,665
we may not talk about the client to others.

263
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:43,065
In order to prevent Yuzuki from being suspected,

264
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:45,465
I'll have to keep my mouth shut as to her job request to me.

265
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:47,365
And for the sake of the pride of being a detective, too.

266
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:49,365
I'm the one that asked him to come here!

267
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:50,965
What?

268
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:53,565
Because I had a mystery that I wanted Mr. Mouri to solve for me.

269
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:57,665
-A mystery? -I hear this popping sound during work

270
00:14:57,665 --> 00:15:00,365
like the sound of the cork of a champagne bottle being removed.

271
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:03,365
-What? -Of course at that time,

272
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:06,065
no champagne is being served to any customers.

273
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:07,865
Even when I clean the shop after closing time,

274
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,165
no cork of any kind has been found.

275
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:14,365
However, I smell the fragrance of yuzu.

276
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:17,565
By the way, how much are you getting paid for this request?

277
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:18,665
She said that she's going to drop all the charges

278
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:20,665
for all the drinks I drank here so far.

279
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:23,365
Of course, you're going to have to pay for

280
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:25,065
the Gimlet that I served tonight though.

281
00:15:25,065 --> 00:15:27,165
What? I do?

282
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:31,265
So, they're the three

283
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,865
who were drinking with the victim? Is that correct?

284
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:35,165
Yes, sir.

285
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:39,865
I asked them several questions before you got here, Inspector.

286
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:41,765
Starting from the person to your right.

287
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:44,765
She's Ms. Mika Kishiura, age 30.

288
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:47,965
He's Mr. Kensaku Hatsumura, age 31.

289
00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:51,665
And, he's Mr. Monpei Kogure, age 28.

290
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:54,165
They all work at the same company

291
00:15:54,165 --> 00:15:55,865
along with the victim, Mr. Usuda who is their department head.

292
00:15:55,865 --> 00:16:01,265
And they were all here tonight to celebrate his birthday.

293
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:06,365
Which means that one of three here,

294
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,365
had a grudge against the department head

295
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:10,665
and poisoned him to death.

296
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:12,765
Hey, hold it, will you?

297
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:16,065
We were all just celebrating his birthday.

298
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:18,665
We didn't poison him to death!

299
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:21,365
Didn't you three do it?

300
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:25,565
You guys were shooting glances at me, a detective, and whispering.

301
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:29,865
We were saying that you look just like the "Sleeping Kogoro!"

302
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,865
We had no idea that you were the man himself.

303
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:35,165
Besides, we've got no motive to kill him.

304
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:38,965
But you guys were all talking among yourselves

305
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,065
after the department head got wasted, right?

306
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:43,565
Saying things like he forced you

307
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:45,065
to buy super expensive birthday gifts,

308
00:16:45,065 --> 00:16:47,265
so you were pissed.

309
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:49,565
You were listening, sonny?

310
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:51,865
Yes! Because I got good ears!

311
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:54,565
Moreover, you also mentioned that a person called Yoshikuwa

312
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:57,365
that the department head despised committed suicide.

313
00:16:57,365 --> 00:17:02,665
And that the man called Yoshikuwa was going with you too, miss!

314
00:17:02,665 --> 00:17:04,565
Is that true?

315
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,365
Yes. It's true.

316
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:10,465
Not only that, Mr. Hatsumura here was his senior in university,

317
00:17:10,465 --> 00:17:12,965
and Mr. Kogure entered the company at the same time he did!

318
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,265
Besides, we'd never play billiards and darts

319
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:19,165
with somebody we hate so much as to want to kill him!

320
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:20,965
You were playing games with the victim?

321
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:23,865
Yes, until the department head got wasted,

322
00:17:23,865 --> 00:17:26,865
we were taking turns being his game partner.

323
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:31,065
Was the department head really playing with those three people?

324
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:34,365
That's right! You kept going home each time,

325
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:35,865
so you didn't see what happened, did you?

326
00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:38,465
That department head really was a problem, you see.

327
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:41,465
The dart board here is only for soft darts,

328
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:42,865
but he tried to use the steel darts

329
00:17:42,865 --> 00:17:44,265
that were given to him as a birthday present

330
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:47,265
and got into trouble with the other customers.

331
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:48,765
Those three people went over to stop the fight

332
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:51,865
and managed to cool everyone off.

333
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:53,865
It seemed they decided to let him rest at the table

334
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,265
and wait for him to get sober.

335
00:17:56,265 --> 00:17:58,065
And, what about after that?

336
00:17:58,065 --> 00:18:01,765
Three of them were playing billiards and darts for a while.

337
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:04,665
They seemed to be switching partner each time one person lost.

338
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:08,065
Which means that when two of the three were playing,

339
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:09,165
each person had the chance

340
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:12,465
to spend time with the department head alone, right?

341
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:15,065
In other words, each of you three people had the chance

342
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:19,865
to be alone with the department head, just the two of you.

343
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,865
Okay, we're going to have to do a body check on you,

344
00:18:22,865 --> 00:18:24,765
as well as check your belongings.

345
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:30,165
A billiard cue.

346
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:32,365
It sure does look expensive!

347
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:36,965
Yes. It cost 160,000 yen but was selling for 100,000 yen

348
00:18:36,965 --> 00:18:38,365
so I decided to get it for the department head.

349
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:41,565
And, just as this boy mentioned.

350
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:45,265
I didn't intend to buy him such an expensive gift,

351
00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:47,565
so I was a bit annoyed.

352
00:18:47,565 --> 00:18:50,565
Do you think I'd kill somebody for a reason like that?

353
00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:55,165
But if you were to attach a poisoned needle on the tip of the cue,

354
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:56,965
even if you were away from the table,

355
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:59,465
you could probably have poked him with it?

356
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:01,965
What? If I did something so obvious,

357
00:19:01,965 --> 00:19:03,965
somebody would've remembered it!

358
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:06,365
I didn't do anything of that sort, did I?

359
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:07,665
No.

360
00:19:07,665 --> 00:19:09,365
As soon as the department got wasted,

361
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:12,865
he hastily put the cue back into the case.

362
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:15,965
I see. So, these darts

363
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:19,465
were what caused the fight with the customers.

364
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:22,865
I didn't deliberately buy it to cause the fight, you know!

365
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:26,665
I only bought it because the department head told me to buy it for him.

366
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,465
I received a vintage dart board that was a keepsake of my grandfather,

367
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:31,965
so I gave it to the department head.

368
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:33,965
Then, he told me to go and buy him darts to go with it, too.

369
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:37,165
I don't play darts at all, you see.

370
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:38,165
Come to think of it,

371
00:19:38,165 --> 00:19:40,365
when the department head pretended to throw the dart at you,

372
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:42,265
you were really panicked, weren't you?

373
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:47,965
Yes. I really panicked back then.

374
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:51,465
I'll bet you laced poison to the tip of the dart

375
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:53,265
and threw it from a distance poking it into him?

376
00:19:53,265 --> 00:19:56,665
Didn't I just tell you? That I'm not good at darts.

377
00:19:56,665 --> 00:19:58,865
Besides, if I were going to throw it from a distance,

378
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,665
it would be easier for me to poke it into him at point blank range!

379
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:04,265
-Well, I guess so. -If you insist on suspecting me,

380
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:08,165
why don't you go ahead and scrutinize the darts?

381
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,665
Of course we will.

382
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:14,765
You got him several boxes of film

383
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:17,065
and a poster of an idol.

384
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:20,265
Compared to the other two, your gifts are way cheaper.

385
00:20:20,265 --> 00:20:24,765
Hey! That poster cost me 30,000 yen autograph and all, you know.

386
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,865
Well, I couldn't help but get it for him

387
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:29,265
because he was sitting near my desk

388
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:32,265
and persistently repeating that he wanted it.

389
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:37,065
The wet part of the poster, it smells like...

390
00:20:37,965 --> 00:20:40,365
This fragrance is the smell of yuzu?

391
00:20:41,765 --> 00:20:43,465
This is...

392
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:44,865
Pops realized it, too!

393
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:46,965
It's Yoko's poster!

394
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:50,265
Moreover, it's the super rare western bikini shot!

395
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:51,465
Is that what he noticed?

396
00:20:51,465 --> 00:20:53,565
I mean, don't wet it!

397
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:55,565
I mean the beauty's all wet!

398
00:20:55,565 --> 00:20:57,165
And he's making bad jokes, too.

399
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:59,565
The champagne splashed on it

400
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:02,065
when Mr. Kogure tried to pull the cork out.

401
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:06,365
By the way, you seemed to have taken quite a lot of pictures.

402
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,965
Did the department head like pictures?

403
00:21:08,965 --> 00:21:12,465
Yes. They're pictures to be uploaded on his blog!

404
00:21:12,465 --> 00:21:15,665
But we're actually the ones

405
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:17,065
who choose the pictures and upload them.

406
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:19,565
The department head's not at home with digitals, you see.

407
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:23,065
Despite that, he likes to put on airs and upload blogs.

408
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:25,165
Well, I'm glad that we don't have

409
00:21:25,165 --> 00:21:28,665
to choose pictures for him anymore from now on.

410
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:33,465
Well, something like that would never lead to murder, though.

411
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:37,365
By the way, who was making the whiskey and water drinks?

412
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:40,865
I was the one making most of it.

413
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:43,965
Then, we'll have to check this too.

414
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:46,565
Because ice picks like the needle of darts

415
00:21:46,565 --> 00:21:48,065
are sharp objects that can be used to kill someone.

416
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:51,165
They are very similar in shape to the murder weapon.

417
00:21:56,965 --> 00:22:00,765
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

418
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:04,065
It seems that my saga of being a detective

419
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:06,665
has brought upon disaster to this pool bar

420
00:22:06,665 --> 00:22:10,365
that was supposed to be my haven of comfort.

421
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:12,065
Well, well...

422
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:16,865
It seems that this case won't let me sleep again tonight.

423
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:43,865
"Next Episode" -There was no trace of poison being laced?

424
00:23:43,865 --> 00:23:46,965
What's going on? No murder weapon.

425
00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:49,965
It's the same as the pick-pocket case the other day.

426
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,465
This is...

427
00:23:54,465 --> 00:23:58,065
Why would clay be stuck on the bottom of something like that?

428
00:23:58,065 --> 00:24:02,165
So, the perp was the customer who had it out with the victim.

429
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:04,065
Don't tell me...

430
00:24:04,065 --> 00:24:09,465
Next Conan, "Kogoro is at the Bar (Part 2)"
