3
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:07,275
came to tour a studio run by an acquaintance of Dr. Agasa.

4
00:00:12,175 --> 00:00:14,175
It's the bronze giant.

5
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:15,675
-Talos! -Talos!

6
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,175
It even looks like bronze up close.

7
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:21,975
It looks so heavy.

8
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:25,775
I hope we get to see the completed Talos soon!

9
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,875
I'm so excited!

Mr. Yamagata.

11
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:33,475
Yeah. We were right.

12
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:37,375
Your sense of professional self-satisfaction won't fix the problem.

I'm rejecting your plan!

17
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,075
Do you understand?

18
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:52,375
I wracked my brain

19
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,975
because I understood your daughter's suffering.

20
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:56,275
How can you say that without hearing me out?

21

Isn't that Mr. Hanyu?

No.

47
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,747
Judging by the wound on his head,

48
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:11,547
it's hard to imagine this was an accident.

I found this on my hand.

00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:03,947
I think it was next to Tadashi's injury.

69
00:05:03,947 --> 00:05:06,147
I recognize that color.

70
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:07,847
Isn't that the color of Talos?

71
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:09,147
Could it be?

72
00:05:11,147 --> 00:05:13,347
Did those fists strike Mr. Hanyu?

73
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:14,347
That's impossible.

74
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,647
Talos has no legs.

75
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,247
It couldn't do that.

76
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:21,747
We didn't find any suspicious persons inside the dome,

77
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:23,847
just figures and models that fell

78
00:05:23,847 --> 00:05:26,647
when the power went out.

79
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:30,147
Could they have entered through a window or vent?

80
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:33,747
There were no signs of that either.

81
00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:36,847
We're checking the security camera footage right now,

82
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:40,047
but we haven't found any suspicious persons.

83
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:43,547
Then who hit Hanyu?

84
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:48,147
Take good care of Hanyu.

85
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,047
He's very important to us.

86
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:52,147
I will.

87
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:55,747
So the culprit

88
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:59,447
took advantage of the opportunity to escape.

89
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:04,247
But we ran here as soon as we heard him scream.

90
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:07,247
I don't think they had time to do that.

91
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:08,447
Hey!

92
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:11,147
No one came through here.

93
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:13,647
I didn't see any suspicious persons either.

94
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:14,947
Me neither.

95
00:06:14,947 --> 00:06:18,747
We came in a hurry so we can't be certain.

96
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,247
Either way,

97
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,047
this had to be the work of someone

98
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:25,047
who intimately familiar with the facility.

99
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:30,947
It's natural to assume the culprit used the situation created

100
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:34,847
by the loss of power and falling models to hit Mr. Hanyu,

101
00:06:34,847 --> 00:06:38,447
but that wouldn't have given them enough time to flee.

102
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:41,147
Then there's the bronze paint...

103
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:45,847
Why was it on Mr. Hanyu's wound?

104
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:48,247
An outsider snuck in?

105
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:51,147
We're known domestically and internationally

106
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:53,847
for our products with originality.

107
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,747
I think it's possible.

108
00:06:56,747 --> 00:07:00,047
Then shouldn't your security be tight?

109
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:03,747
It's just a possibility.

110
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:07,947
It would be wise to have our security guards look into it.

111
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:10,647
We should tell them.

112
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:11,947
You're right.

113
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:13,647
Is there something bothering you?

114
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:14,947
Yes.

115
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:17,947
The service entrance door was broken.

116
00:07:17,947 --> 00:07:20,547
It couldn't be locked.

117
00:07:20,547 --> 00:07:24,047
That's it. The culprit must've entered through there.

118
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:25,247
Wrong!

119
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:28,447
-What? -That door's fine.

120
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:33,747
After all, I made sure it couldn't be opened.

121
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:36,947
You're right. It doesn't look like it was moved.

122
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:41,347
This and the security camera footage

123
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:43,047
eliminates the possibility

124
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,847
that a suspicious person entered

125
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:46,347
through the main or service entrance.

126
00:07:46,347 --> 00:07:48,347
Nice work, Genta.

127
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:49,747
Yes!

128
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:52,547
In other words, one of us is the culprit.

129
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:55,547
Just before the crime,

130
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:58,147
we were saying hello to Mr. Yamagata.

131
00:07:58,147 --> 00:08:02,247
Ms. Shinobu was with us the whole time.

132
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:05,147
Agasa, are you saying I did it?

133
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:06,947
Of course not!

134
00:08:06,947 --> 00:08:08,747
That's not what I'm saying.

135
00:08:08,747 --> 00:08:12,047
I was just stating the truth.

136
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:15,247
They've been friends since college.

137
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:18,847
Apparently they argued often as students.

138
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:20,247
I see.

139
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:21,747
Hey, Mr. President.

140
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:25,847
How many remotes are there that control the dome's facilities?

141
00:08:25,847 --> 00:08:27,047
There are two.

142
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:31,647
Yamagata and the tour guide, Shinobu, each have one.

143
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:34,747
Mr.Yamagata, do you have your remote with you right now?

144
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,047
Yeah...

145
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:39,147
You must mean this.

146
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:41,747
Can you differentiate it from the other remote?

147
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:44,747
No. They're both the same shape.

148
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:51,347
We'll start by asking everyone for their alibi.

149
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:53,947
President Kagami, what were you doing?

150
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:57,847
When I heard Hanyu scream,

151
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:59,647
I'd just concluded a deal over the phone

152
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,747
and was preparing to leave in my office.

153
00:09:02,747 --> 00:09:06,247
The security guards were just returning...

154
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:07,547
Right?

155
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,547
Yes, that's right.

156
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:12,747
What I'm wondering is

157
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:15,547
why Mr. Hanyu was on the observation deck?

158
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:19,247
Why was it necessary to shut off power to the dome?

159
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:21,847
The dome's lights shut off,

160
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:23,847
and we heard the models fall

161
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:26,347
after Mr. Hanyu's scream.

162
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:29,547
Since the lights came back on immediately afterwards...

163
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:34,947
it's likely Mr. Hanyu had a remote.

164
00:09:34,947 --> 00:09:40,847
Which means he should have dropped it around here.

165
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,447
Looking for something?

166
00:09:43,747 --> 00:09:45,347
Good timing.

167
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:48,947
Could you split up and look for a remote?

168
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:51,947
You can stay within a 10 m radius.

169
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:54,847
Got it.

170
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:02,247
Why are we looking for a remote?

171
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:05,447
Remember how the dome's lights shut off?

172
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:08,347
But they immediately came back on, so...

173
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:09,547
So?

174
00:10:09,547 --> 00:10:13,447
So that means Mr. Hanyu had the remote until then.

175
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,547
Mr. Hanyu used it to shut off the power

176
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:19,247
while standing there.

177
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:21,347
Maybe the power shut off because he dropped the remote

178
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:23,247
when he was attacked.

179
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,247
No.

180
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:26,547
If that were the case, the power would have gone out

181
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:29,047
after Mr. Hanyu screamed.

182
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:30,847
Right.

183
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:35,447
Which means Mr. Hanyu chose to shut off the power.

184
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:38,147
But why?

185
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:40,247
We searched pretty thoroughly,

186
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:41,847
but we didn't find the remote.

187
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:45,547
Maybe the culprit took it with them.

188
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:46,647
That's it.

189
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,447
That must be it.

190
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,847
Yeah.

191
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:52,647
Even if the culprit did,

192
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:55,047
they didn't have time to leave

193
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:57,347
without being spotted by us.

194
00:10:57,347 --> 00:10:59,047
That's right.

195
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:00,147
Huh?

196
00:11:00,147 --> 00:11:01,147
What?

197
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:02,347
What is it?

198
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:04,747
During the tour...

199
00:11:12,747 --> 00:11:16,247
Ayumi, you took a picture of the floating boat, right?

200
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:18,347
What? Yeah.

201
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:19,747
Let me see for a while.

202
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,247
Here.

203
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:24,647
Thank you.

204
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:27,347
I knew it!

205
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:29,047
Look.

206
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:31,847
This is the last place we saw the floating boat

207
00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:34,047
during the tour.

208
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:37,547
But now, it's over there.

209
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:40,047
You're right!

210
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,247
The boat is in a different location.

211
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:43,647
But why?

212
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:47,347
Maybe it moved when the power shut off.

213
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:50,647
It may be a light fiberglass boat,

214
00:11:50,647 --> 00:11:54,547
but would losing power make it move that far?

215
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:58,747
I found this on my hand.

216
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:03,347
I see. So that's how it is.

217
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,836
Anything unusual?

218
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:13,936
No matter how small.

219
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:15,336
Is there anything at all?

220
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:16,736
Come to think of it,

221
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,636
while I was on the phone,

222
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:23,236
someone visited my office.

223
00:12:23,236 --> 00:12:27,436
I heard the door open and close twice.

224
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:28,436
Twice?

225
00:12:28,436 --> 00:12:32,236
That means someone entered and then left.

226
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:35,436
Do you have any idea who it was?

227
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:38,836
I thought it was Hanyu or Yamagata.

228
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:40,836
Was it you?

229
00:12:40,836 --> 00:12:43,536
No. It wasn't me.

230
00:12:43,536 --> 00:12:46,236
Then it must've been Hanyu.

231
00:12:46,236 --> 00:12:50,236
Or maybe the culprit had already snuck in by then.

232
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,236
Inspector, we still haven't found any signs

233
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:55,236
that anyone entered or left the studio

234
00:12:55,236 --> 00:12:58,536
around the time of the crime.

235
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:02,436
We'll have to thoroughly search the studio.

236
00:13:02,436 --> 00:13:05,436
Please find the culprit.

237
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:08,236
This man's ideas alone

238
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:10,536
are a treasure trove for anyone in this industry.

239
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:13,436
Please don't, president.

240
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:16,136
Don't be modest.

241
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:18,436
You should hold your head high.

242
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:23,136
But I burn so much money...

243
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:30,236
It's my job as well as Hanyu's to complain about you.

244
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:32,736
Don't worry so much about it, you fool.

245
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:37,536
There are plenty of places for the culprit to hide

246
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:40,436
like offices and storage rooms.

247
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:43,136
If they came for our industry secrets,

248
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:45,636
then while they were looking for treasure...

249
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:47,536
I see.

250
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:52,536
It's possible they ran into Hanyu then.

251
00:13:52,536 --> 00:13:54,136
What is it, Conan?

252
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:59,136
There's something I want to ask Ms. Shinobu.

253
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:06,536
It's me.

254
00:14:06,536 --> 00:14:09,736
How is Hanyu?

255
00:14:09,736 --> 00:14:11,936
You're crying too much to understand.

256
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:14,436
Pull yourself together.

257
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,836
He's in critical condition.

258
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:18,936
What should I do, dad?

259
00:14:18,936 --> 00:14:22,236
Why don't you believe in him?

260
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,436
When he wakes up,

261
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:27,336
the first thing he'll want to see is you looking well.

262
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:30,836
You're right. Thanks, Dad.

263
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,636
What about the culprit?

264
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:35,836
Unfortunately, they still haven't...

265
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:37,636
What?

266
00:14:37,636 --> 00:14:39,136
Please...

267
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:40,336
What is it?

268
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:42,036
You're a nuisance, aren't you?

269
00:14:42,036 --> 00:14:43,236
He sure is.

270
00:14:43,236 --> 00:14:48,036
Sorry, but could you do as he asks?

271
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:49,736
What are you talking about?

272
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:52,136
Take this kid and...

273
00:14:54,236 --> 00:14:56,236
Tell me.

274
00:14:56,236 --> 00:14:57,436
Tell you what?

275
00:14:57,436 --> 00:14:59,936
Do you have your remote with you?

276
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:03,236
What are you doing?

277
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,736
I have it.

278
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:08,136
What about this?

279
00:15:08,136 --> 00:15:09,736
Never mind, then.

280
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:11,136
Thanks.

281
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:15,636
You mischievous brat!

282
00:15:15,636 --> 00:15:17,736
Who is he?

283
00:15:21,836 --> 00:15:25,336
Looks like you solved the mystery.

284
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:27,436
Yeah, more or less.

285
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:31,436
Dr. Agasa, there's one more thing I want to confirm.

286
00:15:31,436 --> 00:15:32,436
What?

287
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:37,636
We'll begin thoroughly searching

288
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,936
the entire studio for the culprit.

289
00:15:39,936 --> 00:15:41,936
We appreciate your cooperation.

290
00:15:41,936 --> 00:15:45,636
-Yes, sir. -There's no need for that.

291
00:15:47,936 --> 00:15:50,936
Dr. Agasa, what do you mean?

292
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:53,136
I know who did it.

293
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:55,236
-What? -The culprit?

294
00:15:55,236 --> 00:15:56,436
Who is it?

295
00:15:56,436 --> 00:15:58,536
Now... Calm down.

296
00:16:00,736 --> 00:16:04,136
Well, what's next?

297
00:16:06,236 --> 00:16:09,736
Dr. Agasa, he said something about the remote.

298
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12,236
Oh, yeah. That's right.

299
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:13,636
Are you listening?

300
00:16:13,636 --> 00:16:17,336
There are two remotes that control the dome's facilities.

301
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:19,636
Isn't that right, President Kagami?

302
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:21,436
Yes, that's correct.

303
00:16:21,436 --> 00:16:26,536
And one of those was used during the crime.

304
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:29,636
The power came back on immediately after it was shut off, but...

305
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:33,936
During that moment,

306
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:37,336
all the models floating in the air fell.

307
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:41,536
But one of them behaved unnaturally

308
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:43,536
which is...

309
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,536
the floating boat.

310
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:49,736
When the power goes out,

311
00:16:49,736 --> 00:16:53,436
the no longer suspended swinging boat

312
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:57,636
should fall to its lowest point.

313
00:16:57,636 --> 00:17:00,636
However, the floating boat is over there,

314
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:02,336
in a different position

315
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:04,336
from the one it was in before the attack.

316
00:17:04,336 --> 00:17:07,036
How did that happen?

317
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:08,936
Uh, well...

318
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:10,536
That...

319
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:13,336
I was the first to notice.

320
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:16,236
I was looking at the photos Ayumi took.

321
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,836
See?

322
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:22,336
This was the floating boat's final position during our tour

323
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:27,136
and now it's over there after the attack.

324
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:29,136
You're right. It moved.

325
00:17:29,136 --> 00:17:32,836
Someone must've moved it using the remote.

326
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:36,036
Mr. Yamagata, do you know anything?

327
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:38,236
I...

328
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:40,136
Or maybe...

329
00:17:40,136 --> 00:17:44,936
Mr. Hanyu had a remote during the attack.

330
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:47,236
As the last to arrive,

331
00:17:47,236 --> 00:17:51,136
wouldn't you have had the opportunity to retrieve the remote

332
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,036
while we were distracted by discovering the injured Hanyu?

333
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:57,136
I don't know anything.

334
00:17:57,136 --> 00:17:58,436
Mr. Yamagata,

335
00:17:58,436 --> 00:18:01,636
aren't you the one who overheard my conversation

336
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:03,136
with Kagami in his office?

337
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:05,536
Doesn't this studio exist

338
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:07,536
because of Mr. Yamagata's talent?

339
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:09,836
You don't know anything.

340
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:11,536
My company's been in the red

341
00:18:11,536 --> 00:18:13,236
since his father worked here.

342
00:18:13,236 --> 00:18:14,736
No way...

343
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:26,136
What's this?

344
00:18:28,536 --> 00:18:31,036
Then you should hate me.

345
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:34,536
Why did you attack Hanyu?

346
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:36,936
That's right.

347
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:39,436
You were my target!

348
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:42,136
I tried to set a trap for you!

349
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:45,836
I've created something I'm proud of.

350
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:49,136
Use your remote in the dome.

351
00:18:49,136 --> 00:18:52,736
You'll see something incredible when the power goes out.

352
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:57,436
I left you a note.

353
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,536
I wasn't expecting Hanyu to be there.

354
00:19:02,236 --> 00:19:05,236
I finally get it now.

355
00:19:05,236 --> 00:19:07,236
Hanyu wanted to present your new product

356
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:12,136
to the Suzuki Financial Group as a gift.

357
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:16,436
Without realizing it was a trap.

358
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:24,036
Your target was President Kagami,

359
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:26,936
but Mr. Hanyu fell for your trap instead.

360
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:30,736
You can tell us all about it at the station.

361
00:19:31,936 --> 00:19:34,636
There's no point in running!

362
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:36,536
There's no exit that way!

363
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:37,536
Could it be?

364
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:39,536
Stay back!

365
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:41,336
Watch out! Everyone, get down!

366
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:46,136
It vanished?

367
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:54,436
What?

368
00:19:54,436 --> 00:19:55,936
What is that?

369
00:19:55,936 --> 00:19:58,236
Talos's hand!

370
00:19:58,236 --> 00:19:59,536
Run!

371
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:00,936
Yamagata!

372
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:08,336
I'm sorry.

373
00:20:12,436 --> 00:20:14,136
No, you don't!

374
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:27,136
"Kagami Studio"

375
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,336
Yamagata!

376
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:40,036
Listen to me.

377
00:20:40,036 --> 00:20:43,836
I just made a deal with Franklin Planning.

378
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:46,536
This studio will become Franklin's Japanese branch.

379
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,736
None of the employees will be laid off.

380
00:20:48,736 --> 00:20:50,536
We'll keep the whole staff.

381
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:54,236
The Kagami name and I will be gone,

382
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:55,836
but the studio will continue operating

383
00:20:55,836 --> 00:20:58,936
under the name Yamagata Room on a trial basis.

384
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:02,136
You should be grateful, you fool!

385
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:08,936
Once you've gotten that through your head,

386
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:11,936
go do your job.

387
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:16,336
Everyone's waiting for you, you fool.

388
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:26,736
I'm sorry for the trouble.

389
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:56,636
Dad, Tadashi has regained consciousness.

390
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:59,236
The hospital director said he's fine

391
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:01,236
and not to worry.

392
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:04,736
I see. That's great news, Shinobu.

393
00:23:04,736 --> 00:23:07,436
Did you find the culprit?

394
00:23:10,236 --> 00:23:12,636
What's wrong, Dad?

395
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:19,536
Don't worry, Shinobu.

396
00:23:19,536 --> 00:23:22,336
The case has been solved.

397
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:26,136
Your father was a good man after all.

398
00:23:30,936 --> 00:23:33,536
I'm sure Talos will get his day eventually.

399
00:23:33,536 --> 00:23:35,336
Yeah.

400
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:38,536
I'm sure the giant's entire body will be completed.

401
00:23:38,536 --> 00:23:39,736
Someday.

402
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:44,536
"Next Episode" -You may not be strong

403
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:46,636
but you've got money.

404
00:23:46,636 --> 00:23:48,836
You'll pay, won't you?

405
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:52,836
Apparently they've found dinosaur bones and footprints before.

406
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:56,336
All right! Let's find an ammonite!

407
00:23:56,336 --> 00:23:59,536
Which means someone poisoned the bathroom beforehand

408
00:23:59,536 --> 00:24:04,136
and made the victim touch it.

409
00:24:07,636 --> 00:24:13,036
