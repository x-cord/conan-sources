1
00:00:06,336 --> 00:00:07,536
This is it.

2
00:00:09,336 --> 00:00:12,336
"Kagami Studio" -This is amazing!

3
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:13,736
Shall we go?

4
00:00:14,936 --> 00:00:16,236
Good work.

5
00:00:17,536 --> 00:00:19,036
Good work.

6
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:21,136
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:21,136 --> 00:00:22,636
Genta.

8
00:00:22,636 --> 00:00:24,136
Sorry.

9
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:27,536
Are they coming to see the studio on their day off?

10
00:00:27,536 --> 00:00:31,636
Mr. Agasa requested a tour for the kids.

11
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:35,436
So they're our future regulars.

12
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:38,636
If this place lasts that long.

13
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:41,936
Are we really in trouble?

14
00:00:41,936 --> 00:00:43,936
Have you heard something?

15
00:00:43,936 --> 00:00:47,036
Well, I heard a top-class corporation

16
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:49,636
called dibs on the place.

17
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:51,336
It's just a rumor, though.

18
00:00:54,236 --> 00:00:55,936
In my eyes are maximum creation.

19
00:00:55,936 --> 00:00:57,736
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

20
00:00:57,736 --> 00:00:59,436
The security guards' anxious conversation

21
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:01,636
leads to some toy-related crime!

22
00:01:01,636 --> 00:01:03,236
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:03,236 --> 00:01:05,336
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:07,936
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:54,839
"The Killer Fist of Talos (Part 1)"

26
00:02:55,395 --> 00:02:57,195
I've been waiting for you.

27
00:02:57,195 --> 00:02:59,695
Sorry to trouble you, Ms. Shinobu.

28
00:02:59,695 --> 00:03:01,895
"Shinobu Kagami (23), President's Daughter, Secretary" -Well...

29
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:05,895
The president said he wanted to speak with you.

30
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:08,995
It must be about the plan we discussed the other day.

31
00:03:08,995 --> 00:03:10,495
What did that...

32
00:03:10,495 --> 00:03:12,995
Oh, excuse me.

33
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:15,795
What did your father say?

34
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:22,095
I'm sorry, but you'll have to ask him yourself.

35
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:24,195
He's in his office.

36
00:03:24,195 --> 00:03:27,595
I'll show the rest of you around.

37
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:30,695
Thank you. Please do.

38
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:31,795
I will.

39
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:38,395
That dome over there is for tours.

40
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:40,595
It's big.

41
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,895
The children must love it.

42
00:03:42,895 --> 00:03:44,995
Unfortunately, it's designed for professionals.

43
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:49,595
It's for requests for event characters and modeling.

44
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:52,595
You can take all the pictures you want.

45
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:53,695
Really?

46
00:03:53,695 --> 00:03:56,395
In that case, say cheese.

47
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,595
No... You can't take pictures of me.

48
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:03,795
-She must be shy. -Yeah.

49
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:05,395
Geez...

50
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:09,595
But what if another company copies your figures?

51
00:04:09,595 --> 00:04:13,495
Yeah. You should watch out for corporate spies.

52
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:15,995
Yeah. You don't want any bad supplies.

53
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:17,795
-Genta. -Genta...

54
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:19,095
Don't worry.

55
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:21,195
We check everyone's identity and possessions

56
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,195
before taking them on tours.

57
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:28,895
Besides, it's not that easy to get inside the studio.

58
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:31,495
Really?

59
00:04:31,495 --> 00:04:33,395
Come in.

60
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:35,095
First!

61
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:40,595
Is this...

62
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:44,095
It's a goblin, like the ones that appear in Western stories.

63
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:46,595
They're mischievous little imps.

64
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:49,995
This is the Greek mythological ship, Argo.

65
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:52,595
Heroes like Perseus and Orpheus,

66
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:55,995
who became constellations, rode on this ship.

67
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,795
You sure are knowledgeable.

68
00:04:57,795 --> 00:05:00,495
-This is cool! -This is cool!

69
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:02,795
It's like a dreamland.

70
00:05:09,695 --> 00:05:11,495
It's Sun Wukong!

71
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:14,595
That's right. He's riding the Jindou cloud.

72
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:17,595
He appears in China's "Journey to the West."

73
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:26,495
What a beautiful ship.

74
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:28,395
That's the floating boat in the sky.

75
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,495
It's a legendary flying ship

76
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,795
that appears in Japanese mythology.

77
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:36,095
It's facing this way.

78
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:49,695
Despite its appearance,

79
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,995
it's made of fiberglass, so it's light.

80
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,195
Really?

81
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:56,695
It doesn't seem that way at all.

82
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:59,495
You can control its position and orientation?

83
00:05:59,495 --> 00:06:01,695
Yes, easily.

84
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,395
With this single remote,

85
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:05,895
you can control all the facilities

86
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:07,895
and even the security in the dome.

87
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:11,095
It would be terrible if it broke.

88
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:14,995
If the remote detects any shocks or malfunctions,

89
00:06:14,995 --> 00:06:17,895
control switches to the control room

90
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:19,795
inside the dome.

91
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:20,995
When control switches over,

92
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:24,395
the power inside the dome goes out for a second,

93
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:26,095
but it's safe.

94
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,895
As long as there's nothing wrong with the remote,

95
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:30,195
control switches back to it.

96
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,395
It's a mandragora!

97
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,395
People die if they hear its voice!

98
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,495
It's incredible!

99
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:44,495
Isn't that the roc?

100
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:47,595
Yeah, from "The Adventures of Sinbad".

101
00:06:48,695 --> 00:06:49,995
The Garuda?

102
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:52,795
They've even got Indian mythological creatures.

103
00:07:05,395 --> 00:07:07,395
It's the bronze giant.

104
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:08,995
-Talos! -Talos!

105
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:19,795
You kids sure are knowledgeable.

106
00:07:19,795 --> 00:07:23,395
There aren't many adults who know who he is.

107
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:25,195
We're brimming with curiosity.

108
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,395
We're even part of the Youth Detective Squad.

109
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:31,295
Talos moves even though he's so big.

110
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:32,295
That's right.

111
00:07:32,295 --> 00:07:34,195
We only move Talos and the floating boat

112
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:37,395
for special occasions.

113
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:40,095
Talos in particular took an incredible amount of effort.

114
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:43,795
His fists and arms alone were redone countless times.

115
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,095
Make Talos stand up.

116
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:50,795
I bet that's amazing.

117
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:52,195
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:55,895
He's not finished from the legs down.

119
00:07:55,895 --> 00:07:58,395
What? When is he going to be finished?

120
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,195
Well...

121
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:04,995
Unfortunately, he'll never be finished.

122
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:08,495
"Tadashi Hanyu (25)" -We wouldn't want to get people's hopes up.

123
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:11,595
Honestly, it's quite difficult to build the entire body

124
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:13,295
of something that large.

125
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:15,795
Because it's too expensive?

126
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,895
Children these days are so smart.

127
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:22,495
I wish Mr. Yamagata could've heard that.

128
00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:24,495
Mr. Hanyu!

129
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:27,595
Who's Yamagata?

130
00:08:29,095 --> 00:08:31,595
"Tokuichi Yamagata (35)" -Let's not talk about that anymore,

131
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,195
Mr. Hanyu.

132
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:37,495
Didn't we decide that we'd leave it up to the president?

133
00:08:37,495 --> 00:08:39,895
That's easy for you to say

134
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,695
but as the one holding the company's purse strings,

135
00:08:41,695 --> 00:08:43,695
I'll never agree to it.

136
00:08:50,995 --> 00:08:52,595
Hey...

137
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:55,795
It's true that Talos was expensive,

138
00:08:55,795 --> 00:08:59,295
but without having legs will kill him.

139
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:03,095
Do you kids know the story of Talos' heel?

140
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:04,095
-Yeah! -Yeah!

141
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:06,295
The only weakness of the bronze automaton Talos,

142
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:12,095
who protected the island of Crete in Greek mythology,

143
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:14,795
was his heel, right?

144
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:17,295
That's right.

145
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:19,395
Well, Mr. Hanyu?

146
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:21,695
For Talos to truly be Talos,

147
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,195
he needs legs.

148
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:31,695
The Talos you saw is too big to leave the dome,

149
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:33,095
but look...

150
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:37,395
By breaking him down into parts and transporting them,

151
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:39,495
the bronze giant Talos can appear

152
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:44,095
before audiences around the world.

153
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:45,795
Look at this!

154
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:48,895
It's really light!

155
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:50,395
What are you doing, Genta?

156
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,095
Put it back where you found it!

157
00:09:52,095 --> 00:09:53,995
What if you break it?

158
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:55,995
It's important!

159
00:09:57,195 --> 00:09:59,595
Go on. Apologize.

160
00:09:59,595 --> 00:10:01,895
Sorry.

161
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:03,295
It's fine.

162
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:07,295
You're free to look at and touch everything in here.

163
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:09,495
Really?

164
00:10:09,495 --> 00:10:10,795
Yes.

165
00:10:10,795 --> 00:10:12,595
-All right! -All right!

166
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:16,695
It even looks like bronze up close.

167
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:18,495
It looks so heavy.

168
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,295
I hope we get to see the completed Talos soon.

169
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:25,395
I'm so excited.

170
00:10:25,395 --> 00:10:26,895
Mr. Yamagata.

171
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:29,995
Yeah. We were right.

172
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:33,895
Your sense of professional self-satisfaction won't fix the problem.

173
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:36,395
Whether we live or die

174
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:38,495
is a matter of business.

175
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:41,695
Then we should be investing in our future!

176
00:10:41,695 --> 00:10:44,795
Under current circumstances, our company has no future.

177
00:10:44,795 --> 00:10:47,295
That's enough, you two.

178
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:50,995
It's not that easy a matter to compromise, Ms. Shinobu.

179
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:52,095
What?

180
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:53,595
This day...

181
00:10:53,595 --> 00:10:56,995
No, every second is important.

182
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:59,395
In that regard, we agree.

183
00:10:59,395 --> 00:11:03,795
Fine. Let's go get the president's decision now.

184
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:05,695
Don't go bringing your family's hobby

185
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:08,495
into my business.

186
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:10,095
Tadashi!

187
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:11,595
Sorry.

188
00:11:21,895 --> 00:11:26,495
Was it just a hobby?

189
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,895
"President's Office" -I'll say it again!

190
00:11:38,895 --> 00:11:41,195
I'm rejecting your plan!

191
00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:42,495
Do you understand?

192
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:43,795
No!

193
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:46,395
"Eizo Kagami (58)" -Ms. Shinobu placed the order.

194
00:11:46,395 --> 00:11:48,095
She asked me to design Talos' driving system

195
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,695
as cheaply as possible.

196
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:51,795
What?

197
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:55,095
I wracked my brains

198
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:56,595
because I understood your daughter's suffering.

199
00:11:56,595 --> 00:11:58,995
How can you say that without hearing me out?

200
00:11:58,995 --> 00:12:02,095
You've lost your humanity.

201
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:05,795
You've gone too far.

202
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:07,595
Why shouldn't I?

203
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:09,295
Because of your cowardice,

204
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,195
Mr. Yamagata will never be able to show off his talents.

205
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:15,895
You're not an employee. You've no right to talk.

206
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:19,695
I employed Yamagata's father.

207
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:21,895
If he doesn't stop showing off his talents,

208
00:12:21,895 --> 00:12:23,395
the company won't last.

209
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:27,395
Doesn't this studio exist

210
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:29,395
because of Mr. Yamagata's talent?

211
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:31,695
You don't know anything.

212
00:12:31,695 --> 00:12:33,495
My company's been in the red

213
00:12:33,495 --> 00:12:35,095
since his father worked here.

214
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:36,595
No way...

215
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:40,495
That can't be...

216
00:12:44,423 --> 00:12:46,723
"President's Office"

217
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:49,182
I'm out of time.

218
00:12:50,282 --> 00:12:51,782
Wait, Kagami.

219
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,082
What's this?

220
00:13:05,782 --> 00:13:10,882
Dr. Agasa's meeting sure is taking a long time.

221
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:13,182
You're right. He's late.

222
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:15,782
If he's not coming, I'm eating his food.

223
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:18,582
That's right.

224
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:22,282
The rumors about the company being sold are true.

225
00:13:22,282 --> 00:13:25,782
The president is acting without telling Mr. Yamagata.

226
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:29,282
I've been talking to other companies

227
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:31,782
but it's not going well.

228
00:13:31,782 --> 00:13:33,782
I see.

229
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:37,582
Our top priority is keeping the Kagami name,

230
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:40,182
but that's become difficult.

231
00:13:40,182 --> 00:13:42,482
It's been around since the Edo Period.

232
00:13:42,482 --> 00:13:44,482
I'm sure my father can't stand

233
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:48,182
to let it fail in his generation.

234
00:13:48,182 --> 00:13:51,082
They said they'd consider it

235
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:53,782
if we had a special plan in place.

236
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:56,682
What's wrong, Ran?

237
00:13:56,682 --> 00:14:01,182
I feel like I recognize Mr. Hanyu...

238
00:14:01,182 --> 00:14:02,582
That's it.

239
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:04,882
He was at a Suzuki family party.

240
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:07,082
Sonoko loved him.

241
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:10,782
Her uncle seemed happy about it, too.

242
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:12,882
That can't be good.

243
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:15,682
Doesn't she have Kyogoku?

244
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:17,482
We're talking about Sonoko.

245
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,882
She was just excited to talk to a handsome man.

246
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:23,782
Well, I guess that's nothing new.

247
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:26,482
The buyer you're talking about

248
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:28,482
is the Suzuki Financial Group, isn't it?

249
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:30,382
You knew?

250
00:14:30,382 --> 00:14:34,182
A classmate said she saw you at a Suzuki family party.

251
00:14:34,182 --> 00:14:38,682
She said you were dancing with their daughter all night.

252
00:14:38,682 --> 00:14:42,982
Ms. Sonoko Suzuki took a strange liking to me.

253
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:47,282
Isn't she young and pretty?

254
00:14:47,282 --> 00:14:50,082
Not as much as you.

255
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:57,182
Those two are in love.

256
00:14:57,182 --> 00:15:00,882
There's no room for Sonoko.

257
00:15:00,882 --> 00:15:02,982
In any case, I need a plan

258
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:05,482
to present them to seal the deal.

259
00:15:05,482 --> 00:15:08,082
That's the feeling I got, but...

260
00:15:08,082 --> 00:15:11,482
If only you could ask Mr. Yamagata for help.

261
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:14,582
"Future dreams for children!" -I was a little too hard on him earlier.

262
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:19,182
I'm stuffed.

263
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:21,982
Mitsuhiko, where's the washroom?

264
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:24,482
I think I saw one around there.

265
00:15:24,482 --> 00:15:26,882
I see. Around there, huh?

266
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:29,482
Around there...

267
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:30,782
Where are you going?

268
00:15:30,782 --> 00:15:32,282
Around there.

269
00:15:34,482 --> 00:15:36,882
They've got snacks.

270
00:15:37,982 --> 00:15:39,182
I really need to go.

271
00:15:39,182 --> 00:15:41,382
Around there...

272
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:46,682
Sir, my kids are young.

273
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:48,582
What if the company goes under?

274
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:53,482
This place does pay better than other companies.

275
00:15:53,482 --> 00:15:57,682
Why is a company as clean as ours going under?

276
00:15:57,682 --> 00:15:59,082
Who knows?

277
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:02,082
Maybe that's just how the world works.

278
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:12,482
This doorknob is broken.

279
00:16:12,482 --> 00:16:14,882
It won't lock?

280
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:16,182
This isn't good.

281
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:18,782
Let's make sure it gets fixed immediately.

282
00:16:18,782 --> 00:16:19,982
Got it.

283
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:37,482
That was close.

284
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:40,182
I almost wet myself.

285
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:50,082
Is someone there?

286
00:16:57,382 --> 00:17:00,482
It's broken.

287
00:17:00,482 --> 00:17:02,282
How careless.

288
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:07,282
We don't want any bad supplies getting in.

289
00:17:07,282 --> 00:17:09,282
That should do it.

290
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:13,682
You're back?

291
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:15,382
You seem down.

292
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:17,482
Where have you been?

293
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:19,782
I was looking for the washroom.

294
00:17:19,782 --> 00:17:21,882
The washroom's right there.

295
00:17:21,882 --> 00:17:23,682
Oh, no!

296
00:17:23,682 --> 00:17:25,982
Anyway, Dr. Agasa, I'm sorry.

297
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:28,582
For what?

298
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:31,482
I ate your food.

299
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:33,782
But I left your dessert.

300
00:17:33,782 --> 00:17:36,982
Really? Then you can have my dessert, too.

301
00:17:36,982 --> 00:17:38,282
Really?

302
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:40,582
Thanks for the food!

303
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:45,582
Children are so energetic.

304
00:17:45,582 --> 00:17:48,382
Sounds like your plan was rejected.

305
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:51,982
The company doesn't have time for it right now.

306
00:17:51,982 --> 00:17:53,782
What's happening?

307
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,282
They're selling.

308
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,082
What? They're selling?

309
00:17:58,082 --> 00:17:59,682
They've steeled their resolve.

310
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:02,982
The president's set his focus overseas.

311
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,882
What a waste.

312
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:06,382
The company's technology and designs

313
00:18:06,382 --> 00:18:08,682
have an established reputation here.

314
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:11,982
You can spend all the money you want building good products,

315
00:18:11,982 --> 00:18:14,082
but if they don't sell, it's over.

316
00:18:14,082 --> 00:18:15,882
It's ironic.

317
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:20,282
Their exceptional technology has become a burden for them.

318
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:21,982
We had a shouting match like the old days,

319
00:18:21,982 --> 00:18:25,082
but that was the end of it.

320
00:18:25,082 --> 00:18:26,482
It's a harsh world.

321
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:28,482
Wait.

322
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,482
Tadashi, where are you going?

323
00:18:30,482 --> 00:18:33,582
I'm going to ask the president how negotiations are going.

324
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:40,782
"President's Office" -Get your boss on the phone immediately.

325
00:18:41,882 --> 00:18:45,682
Tell him that Kagami has finally made his decision.

326
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:48,282
I won't take much of his time.

327
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:51,582
Let's drop all pretenses and have one last conversation.

328
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:55,482
Sorry, but wait there.

329
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:57,682
I can't come to the door right now.

330
00:18:57,682 --> 00:19:01,782
Your father is a compassionate man,

331
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:03,582
but he's stubborn.

332
00:19:03,582 --> 00:19:07,182
He has a habit of suffering alone.

333
00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:08,682
I know.

334
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:11,982
He's often misunderstood because of it.

335
00:19:11,982 --> 00:19:14,782
He's no good with people.

336
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:18,382
His nickname in college was the Wild Pitcher.

337
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:20,382
I was the Clumsy Catcher.

338
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:23,882
I constantly failed to catch his pitches.

339
00:19:23,882 --> 00:19:27,782
Well? This is the most I'm willing to compromise.

340
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:31,682
I hope you'll consider signing a contract under these terms.

341
00:19:33,082 --> 00:19:34,882
Later!

342
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,782
What? Franklin?

343
00:19:37,782 --> 00:19:40,782
He's negotiating with Franklin Planning?

344
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:44,582
Yes. That's what Mr. Hanyu told me.

345
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:46,982
That's a top foreign corporation.

346
00:19:46,982 --> 00:19:49,482
They make a killing in transmedia business.

347
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:52,782
Conan, how do you know that?

348
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:55,682
Well, Shinichi said so.

349
00:19:55,682 --> 00:19:56,782
There it is.

350
00:19:56,782 --> 00:20:01,882
He's asking them to keep the Kagami name.

351
00:20:01,882 --> 00:20:04,182
Keep the Kagami name?

352
00:20:04,182 --> 00:20:07,882
They do care a lot about their honor.

353
00:20:07,882 --> 00:20:09,582
Because he expects negotiations to move slowly,

354
00:20:09,582 --> 00:20:13,382
Mr. Hanyu has been talking to other companies.

355
00:20:13,382 --> 00:20:15,982
But their conditions are hard to swallow.

356
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:19,082
Then we'll exchange documents

357
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:23,882
confirm the conditions we agreed upon over the phone.

358
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:28,682
Tell your boss I hope his business does well.

359
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:30,482
I'll talk to you later.

360
00:20:36,182 --> 00:20:38,282
Sorry...

361
00:20:38,282 --> 00:20:39,582
I kept you waiting.

362
00:20:39,582 --> 00:20:40,682
Huh?

363
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,782
What was that? There's no one here.

364
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:46,582
Mr. Yamagata.

365
00:20:46,582 --> 00:20:48,182
Excuse the intrusion.

366
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:50,282
Good luck with your work.

367
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,582
It was interesting.

368
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:53,482
Sorry for the trouble.

369
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:55,982
We look forward to seeing Talos completed.

370
00:20:55,982 --> 00:20:59,082
Goodbye, Teacher Yamagata.

371
00:21:08,682 --> 00:21:11,382
Teacher?

372
00:21:11,382 --> 00:21:12,982
Me?

373
00:21:18,982 --> 00:21:21,882
I'm really sorry about today.

374
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:24,282
It's fine... Give my best to your father.

375
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:25,282
I will.

376
00:21:33,282 --> 00:21:34,582
What was that sound?

377
00:21:34,582 --> 00:21:35,782
Could it be?

378
00:21:35,782 --> 00:21:37,182
Tadashi?

379
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:47,882
Tadashi!

380
00:21:47,882 --> 00:21:49,782
Where are you?

381
00:21:49,782 --> 00:21:51,582
Answer us!

382
00:21:51,582 --> 00:21:53,782
Come out if you're okay!

383
00:21:53,782 --> 00:21:56,082
Please respond, Mr. Hanyu!

384
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,282
Where are you?

385
00:21:58,282 --> 00:21:59,382
Look!

386
00:21:59,382 --> 00:22:00,482
Isn't that Mr. Hanyu?

387
00:22:00,482 --> 00:22:01,782
What?

388
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:43,882
"Next Episode"

389
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,882
What is this?

390
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,782
What is it, Ms. Shinobu?

391
00:23:47,782 --> 00:23:50,782
I found this on my hand.

392
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:54,082
Tell me.

393
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:56,782
Do you have your remote with you?

394
00:23:58,382 --> 00:24:00,082
What are you doing?

395
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:02,282
What about this?

396
00:24:02,282 --> 00:24:04,382
You mischievous brat!

397
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:06,582
Who is he?

398
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:12,682
