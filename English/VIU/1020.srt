1
00:00:01,055 --> 00:00:04,424
Sera suspects that Haibara may have been turned into a child

2
00:00:04,425 --> 00:00:06,815
and is trying to get close to her.

3
00:00:07,525 --> 00:00:09,754
In order to dodge her investigation,

4
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:17,335
we accepted Professor Agasa's invitation to visit an antique appraiser along with Subaru-san.

5
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,285
However...

6
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,435
Nishitsu-san.

7
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:24,855
Nishitsu-san?

8
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:26,295
What happened?

9
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:28,365
Who did this to you?

10
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:30,625
Th-This...

11
00:00:31,735 --> 00:00:37,524
This is the real tray...

12
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:39,135
Wh-What's this?

13
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:40,775
A crane design?

14
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:45,065
In any case, we need to call an ambulance and the police.

15
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,565
Oh, no. My phone is in my car.

16
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:51,005
Nishitsu-san, wait here. I'll be right back.

17
00:00:58,335 --> 00:00:59,325
That's the room.

18
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:04,745
What's this?

19
00:01:07,705 --> 00:01:10,404
It's no use. He's dead.

20
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:12,055
Hey, Conan-kun.

21
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:15,764
I don't see a tray anywhere.

22
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:16,465
What?

23
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:19,005
What's going on here?

24
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:23,975
Let's begin by checking the back of the tray inside Tojima-san's box.

25
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:30,205
Naturally, whoever owns the bloody tray will become our prime suspect.

26
00:01:31,415 --> 00:01:33,254
There's blood on this.

27
00:01:33,255 --> 00:01:34,105
What?

28
00:01:34,415 --> 00:01:37,584
I see. So you're the culprit.

29
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:39,995
N-No! It wasn't me!

30
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:44,995
Now, now. Just to be sure, let's look at the other two trays.

31
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:50,375
Whoa, whoa.

32
00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:53,835
There's blood on the backs of all three trays.

33
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:56,724
What's going on here?

34
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,244
Well, uh...

35
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:02,685
The culprit probably noticed the blood on the back of the tray,

36
00:02:02,985 --> 00:02:08,064
and used quick thinking to put the same bloody mark on the other two trays.

37
00:02:08,065 --> 00:02:11,595
So we wouldn't know which one is the real tray.

38
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:14,254
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

39
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:16,524
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

40
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:18,344
Three bloodstains conceal the real tray!

41
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:20,634
As the truth approaches, new mysteries appear!

42
00:02:20,635 --> 00:02:22,214
Always determining the one truth

43
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:24,204
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

44
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:26,695
his name is Detective Conan!

45
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:11,785
"The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden, Part Three!"

46
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,605
Hey, you.

47
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:21,735
Making us stay here won't get you anywhere.

48
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:23,764
B-But...

49
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:25,905
I'm leaving.

50
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:27,655
You can't leave.

51
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:30,874
Judging by the situation,

52
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:36,744
it's likely that one of you struck Nishitsu-san the appraiser on the head with a spear,

53
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:43,175
and used that same spear to stab him in the back and kill him.

54
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:46,055
We'd like you to stay a little longer.

55
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:50,055
How much longer?

56
00:04:50,335 --> 00:04:55,815
How are you going to find the culprit when none of the appraisers can make it here?

57
00:04:56,045 --> 00:05:00,974
We're currently reaching out to appraisers from other prefectures.

58
00:05:00,975 --> 00:05:02,315
If you could wait just a little longer...

59
00:05:11,335 --> 00:05:12,325
Inspector Megure.

60
00:05:13,725 --> 00:05:15,705
According to the housekeepers,

61
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:19,835
the victim said he wanted to see the shocked expressions on his clients' faces

62
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:24,335
when he showed them this parcel during his explanation.

63
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:28,715
Perhaps his explanation on the trays is written on it.

64
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:32,464
There certainly seems to be something written on it.

65
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,855
But it's written so beautifully that it's illegible.

66
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:39,855
That's the box for the dish I asked him to appraise.

67
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:41,544
Box for a dish?

68
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:45,614
Yeah. The surface with writing on it is the lid.

69
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:48,554
You can open it by sliding it upwards.

70
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:50,285
L-Like this?

71
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,554
You're right. There's an antique dish inside.

72
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:57,705
Excuse me.

73
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:00,604
May I take a look?

74
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:05,744
Sure. From the looks of it, it doesn't seem connected to the case.

75
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:06,845
Thank you.

76
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:14,475
Huh?

77
00:06:14,895 --> 00:06:17,844
There's some paint missing on the back of the dish.

78
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:20,975
It looks like there are cracks on the bare spot, too.

79
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:23,184
That's odd.

80
00:06:23,185 --> 00:06:28,085
When I found it, the paint wasn't peeling off.

81
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:31,615
That's it!

82
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:33,205
Hey, Professor.

83
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:33,875
Huh?

84
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:39,615
When you flipped over the tray, what was the orientation of the crane carved onto the front?

85
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:43,625
The orientation of the crane?

86
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:52,265
I think it was like this.

87
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:01,394
Hey, Detective Takagi. Try flipping their trays over again.

88
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:03,644
What? Again?

89
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:07,155
Yeah. Flip them over sideways like you did before.

90
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:20,424
Okay, I flipped them over.

91
00:07:20,425 --> 00:07:21,915
Also, Detective Chiba.

92
00:07:22,895 --> 00:07:24,165
What is it, Conan-kun?

93
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,025
On the cushions inside the boxes...

94
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,595
Yeah, there was one.

95
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:33,845
There was one box that had a bloodstain there.

96
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:36,845
I see.

97
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:39,465
So that's how it is.

98
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:44,105
I can't stand this any longer.

99
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:48,444
Staying at the crime scene is giving me the creeps.

100
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:50,865
Just look at the tatami mat.

101
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:55,865
The blood splatter reaches our boxes.

102
00:07:57,485 --> 00:08:01,904
We can put our trays back in our boxes and leave now, right?

103
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:04,875
You can finish questioning us another day.

104
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:07,404
Please wait a little longer.

105
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:11,795
An appraiser who knows a fair bit about antiques is on their way.

106
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:15,595
"Knows a fair bit?" You can't be serious.

107
00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:19,284
If the tray inside our box is determined to be real,

108
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:23,355
we'll be suspected of murdering Nishitsu-san, right?

109
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:28,844
Such an important responsibility can't be trusted to someone who isn't an expert.

110
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:31,144
I agree.

111
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:38,164
Though I'd never kill someone to get my hands on a real black lacquer tray.

112
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:40,115
Hey, you guys.

113
00:08:40,555 --> 00:08:47,625
What if I told you I could tell the real tray apart from the fakes without an appraiser?

114
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,005
What?

115
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:52,404
Remember what you said earlier, Professor Agasa?

116
00:08:52,405 --> 00:08:55,764
After being struck on the head with a spear,

117
00:08:55,765 --> 00:09:00,214
Nishitsu Hogen-san pointed at the real tray with his bloody hand.

118
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:01,645
Y-Yeah.

119
00:09:02,245 --> 00:09:05,645
Nishitsu-san left a bloody fingerprint on the tray.

120
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:12,574
When you flipped the tray over sideways, there was a crane pattern on the front,

121
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:17,785
and its beak was pointing in the same direction as the bloody fingerprint.

122
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:21,284
Y-Yeah. That's what I thought, anyway.

123
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:24,535
But we just finished checking that.

124
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:30,654
We turned each tray so the bloodstain was pointing straight up and flipped them over sideways,

125
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:34,845
but none of the cranes' beaks were pointing straight up.

126
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:38,414
Then let's check it again.

127
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:42,764
When you flipped over the tray, the bloodstain was pointing northeast,

128
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:46,604
or at 1:30 on a clock face, right?

129
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:48,105
That's right.

130
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:52,485
Could you flip the trays over again based on that information?

131
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:58,905
This time rotate the trays so the blood is pointing at 1:30.

132
00:09:59,505 --> 00:10:02,155
And when you flip them over sideways...

133
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:11,314
That's right. When the trays are flipped over sideways,

134
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:15,635
the only crane with a beak pointing at 1:30

135
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:20,475
is on the tray inside your box!

136
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:31,794
That's right. When the trays are flipped over sideways,

137
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:35,905
the only crane with a beak pointing at 1:30

138
00:10:36,495 --> 00:10:40,655
is on the tray inside your box!

139
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:44,755
Tojima Motoyuki-san!

140
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:47,594
But why?

141
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:53,234
Earlier none of the cranes' beaks pointed in the same direction as the blood.

142
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,425
That's because the trays were rotated so the blood was pointing straight up.

143
00:10:56,975 --> 00:10:59,944
When a plate-like object with a mark is flipped over sideways

144
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:05,224
and there's a mark in the same spot on the back,

145
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:10,824
we tend to think the marks are in the same place on the front and back of the plate,

146
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:13,755
but that's only true when mark is at the very top.

147
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:19,905
Before the professor flipped over the tray,

148
00:11:20,415 --> 00:11:24,914
the bloodstain was pointing northeast, or at 1:30 on a clock,

149
00:11:24,915 --> 00:11:28,264
so unless the crane's beak was pointing at 10:30, or northwest,

150
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:33,405
it wouldn't end up in the same spot when it was flipped over.

151
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:38,084
That's why the crane's beak wasn't pointing straight up

152
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:41,965
when we flipped over trays with bloodstains pointing straight up.

153
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,584
I see.

154
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:47,404
Then it was Tojima Motoyuki-san who stabbed Nishitsu-san to death with a spear

155
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:53,225
and swapped his own tray out for the real one.

156
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:55,605
Wh-Why would you assume that?

157
00:11:55,845 --> 00:12:01,124
Apparently Nishitsu-san told that Agasa fellow that "this is the real tray."

158
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,405
We don't know whether the culprit overheard that or not.

159
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:11,354
It's possible that they simply put matching bloodstains on all the trays

160
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,885
and returned them to their boxes in order to throw off the investigation.

161
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:19,664
S-So the real tray was in my box because mine

162
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:22,664
happened to be the real one in the first place.

163
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:25,424
Hey, don't go making up nonsense.

164
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:27,544
Don't be so unreasonably stubborn.

165
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:28,644
But...

166
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:30,055
That's right.

167
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,805
You're being really stubborn, mister.

168
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:33,815
What?

169
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:37,565
After all, the other two couldn't have done it.

170
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:40,065
Wh-What do you mean, Conan-kun?

171
00:12:40,235 --> 00:12:47,614
The culprit struck the appraiser on the head with that long heavy spear, right?

172
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:48,455
Yeah.

173
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:52,654
The old man and woman aren't strong enough.

174
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:55,054
If they tried to lift that heavy spear,

175
00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:58,465
they would've staggered, causing the tatami mat to make a creaking sound.

176
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,835
Nishitsu-san would've noticed.

177
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:01,835
A sound?

178
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:03,434
Don't you think so?

179
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:06,245
Maybe, but...

180
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:11,345
Kid, I'll tell you something since you don't seem to know.

181
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:16,355
Nishitsu-san's hearing aid was malfunctioning.

182
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:21,104
So Nishitsu-san wouldn't have noticed

183
00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:24,114
if the culprit staggered or the mat creaked.

184
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:25,695
How did you know that?

185
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:26,825
What?

186
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:32,325
How did you know Nishitsu-san's hearing aid was malfunctioning?

187
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:37,205
Is it because he told you before you struck him?

188
00:13:37,455 --> 00:13:40,034
No, I...

189
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:42,965
Did you call me?

190
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:45,215
In that case, I must apologize.

191
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:48,715
It seems my hearing aid is acting up again.

192
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:56,744
We realized the hearing aid was malfunctioning because the professor sent him a message, right?

193
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:57,725
Yes.

194
00:13:58,025 --> 00:14:04,985
The message the professor sent Nishitsu-san 30 minutes before we arrived hadn't been opened.

195
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:09,444
If it was unopened because he didn't hear his phone's notification,

196
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:13,305
then we can assume his hearing aid had been malfunctioning since then.

197
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:16,455
Tojima-san.

198
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:24,775
Didn't you say you didn't realize the object Nishitsu-san was wearing on his ear was a hearing aid?

199
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:30,925
Given that Nishitsu-san had been conversing with you normally,

200
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:35,935
then as Conan-kun said, you must've learned his hearing aid was malfunctioning when...

201
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:47,945
I... didn't mean to kill him.

202
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:52,404
My daughter has a serious illness that costs a huge amount of money to treat.

203
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:57,455
My last hope was the black lacquer tray I found in storage.

204
00:14:57,835 --> 00:15:04,264
Since two other clients had brought in similar trays, I couldn't help myself.

205
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:07,715
I came to ask about the results before the other two.

206
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:09,624
Take a look.

207
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,345
Look at its dignified and magnificent appearance.

208
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:16,704
This is the real black lacquer tray.

209
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:21,305
Unfortunately, it's not the one you brought.

210
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,565
No...

211
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:25,855
However...

212
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:28,235
That's my tray!

213
00:15:33,245 --> 00:15:34,315
Five million...

214
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,625
If I had five million more yen, I could afford my daughter's surgery.

215
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:42,804
Your own tray would've been enough to cover that cost.

216
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:43,625
What?

217
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:48,605
The other two trays aren't fakes, but studies.

218
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:51,554
Carved by famous engravers when they were young,

219
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:55,005
they're impressive works modeled after the real tray.

220
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:57,524
They can't compare to the real tray,

221
00:15:57,525 --> 00:16:00,835
but they're probably worth several million yen.

222
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,894
No...

223
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:07,775
Th-Then what I did was... no...

224
00:16:13,065 --> 00:16:17,744
H-Hey, more importantly, which box was the real tray in?

225
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:20,075
Naturally, it was in mine, right?

226
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:22,705
Actually...

227
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:26,425
What?!

228
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:29,215
You don't remember which box it was inside?

229
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:30,624
Really?

230
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:35,715
Yes. I know I put the real tray in my box, but...

231
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:42,904
Then out of respect for your elders, shouldn't you let me take it?

232
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:44,514
You must be joking.

233
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:45,455
Hey.

234
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:49,424
I know who had the real tray.

235
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,235
What?

236
00:16:50,495 --> 00:16:52,134
You do?

237
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:53,985
Yeah, it's simple.

238
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:58,345
When Tojima-san struck Nishitsu-san—look.

239
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:02,174
The blood spray reached their boxes.

240
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:05,745
Because of that, there's some blood on the boxes and trays, too.

241
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:08,654
You're right.

242
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:10,755
Think about it.

243
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:16,264
If the real tray was in front of Nishitsu-san when he was struck,

244
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:20,515
then that tray's box would've been empty at the time.

245
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:26,244
So the person whose cushion inside their box has blood on it,

246
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:30,395
Chono-san, is probably the owner of the real black lacquer tray.

247
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:32,905
All right!

248
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:36,964
What am I supposed to tell the owner?

249
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:38,244
It's all right.

250
00:17:38,245 --> 00:17:42,665
If necessary, I'll lend my tray to your museum.

251
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:45,804
I hope you'll offer us a discounted price.

252
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:50,205
But my dish still remains unappraised.

253
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:53,144
I guess I'll have another appraiser look at it.

254
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:55,444
That won't be necessary.

255
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:56,175
What?

256
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:59,284
The answer is written on the box.

257
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:01,174
You can read this?

258
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:02,185
Yes.

259
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,205
"The harder you hide, the more obvious it becomes."

260
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:07,814
It's a saying that means the harder you try to conceal something,

261
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:12,195
the more likely it is that others will discover it.

262
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:16,695
And given that the name "Kurisuke" is written at the end,

263
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:22,914
your uncle Kurisuke-san probably repaired a dish

264
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:25,474
he accidentally broke using glue long ago.

265
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:28,704
Fearing it would be discovered,

266
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:34,034
he painted the entire dish with a similarly colored oil paint to cover it up,

267
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:36,965
but suffered a severe scolding for it when he was found out.

268
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:44,885
I believe he put the dish in a box inscribed with that saying as a lesson.

269
00:18:45,945 --> 00:18:48,994
Some of the paint had probably peeled off

270
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:53,264
because Nishitsu-san used a solvent to remove it.

271
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,235
Really? That's all it was?

272
00:18:57,205 --> 00:19:01,235
Anyway, "the harder you hide, the more obvious it becomes," huh?

273
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:05,835
What a fitting saying. Right, you two?

274
00:20:33,935 --> 00:20:36,804
Well, I had fun today.

275
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:38,045
See you later.

276
00:20:41,765 --> 00:20:44,925
I wonder if she'll be back. I wish she'd give me a break.

277
00:20:45,265 --> 00:20:46,535
Unbelievable.

278
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,354
This isn't good.

279
00:20:50,355 --> 00:20:53,305
I doubt she'll come that often.

280
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:56,294
I was able to keep her in check.

281
00:20:56,295 --> 00:21:01,315
"Restore the flow of time?" What do you mean by that?

282
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:06,075
"Restore" implies there's something wrong with the current situation.

283
00:21:06,525 --> 00:21:10,574
Or perhaps there's something wrong with someone other than you.

284
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:13,075
It's none of your business!

285
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:18,755
She seems to have her own secrets she doesn't want examined.

286
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:20,904
About that...

287
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,345
It's all right. I have some idea.

288
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:31,845
Although I won't be able to believe until I see it with my own eyes.

289
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:37,425
No, he's wrong.

290
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:44,614
It's true that I was going to tell him that Sera and Akai-san's mother Mary-san took APTX 4869

291
00:21:44,615 --> 00:21:49,855
and is currently a middle school-aged girl.

292
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:53,765
But I actually wanted to confirm

293
00:21:54,445 --> 00:21:56,325
Mary-san's true identity.

294
00:21:57,795 --> 00:22:01,984
An English woman with that intelligence and skill in hand-to-hand combat.

295
00:22:01,985 --> 00:22:05,635
Furthermore, she called herself "the sister out of territory."

296
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:12,614
Removing the abbreviation TER for "territory"

297
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:17,635
from the English word "sister" leaves you with SIS.

298
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:23,145
In other words, the Secret Intelligence Service.

299
00:22:23,815 --> 00:22:29,305
Also known as MI6, England's secret information bureau.

300
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:38,145
Since she deliberately told me the name "sister out of territory" hinting at that,

301
00:22:40,055 --> 00:22:45,055
does that mean she's testing me to see if I'm competent enough to trust as an ally?

302
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,385
50-50?

303
00:22:51,735 --> 00:22:53,384
My favorite phrase?

304
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:58,134
Yeah, you sometimes use the expression 50-50.

305
00:22:58,135 --> 00:23:03,024
Right. Your father Tsutomu-san said it all the time.

306
00:23:03,025 --> 00:23:07,574
Come to think of it, our late eldest son picked it up from him.

307
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:09,205
Shu-nii did?

308
00:23:10,795 --> 00:23:13,134
More importantly, what about that drug?

309
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:13,735
What?

310
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:15,535
Will you be able to get your hands on any?

311
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:21,165
Not for now. I experienced some odd interference.

312
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:22,934
Odd interference?

313
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:23,665
Yeah.

314
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:27,515
He's a graduate student who lives next door to the professor.

315
00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:32,055
Is he that interesting a person?

316
00:23:32,525 --> 00:23:34,745
Y-Yeah, I guess so.

317
00:23:35,505 --> 00:23:37,434
That was a 50-50.

318
00:23:37,435 --> 00:23:39,555
You're also at fault.

319
00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:42,165
Yeah, right.

320
00:23:45,585 --> 00:23:48,315
A single blow to the back of the head with a blunt object, huh?

321
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:52,075
Isn't this a dying message identifying the culprit?

322
00:23:53,135 --> 00:23:57,635
