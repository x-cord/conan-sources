00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:05,491
"Urai"

2
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:07,791
What's with this chocolate?

3
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:09,991
My! You should at least be aware of

4
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:11,991
the new chocolate products that your company sells.

5
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,591
Yeah.

6
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:16,191
The Spy Choco White that we'll be selling

7
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:18,291
from March for White Day.

8
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:19,591
Yes.

9
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:21,491
An even sourer chocolate

10
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:23,091
than the favoured Spy Choco Black.

11
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:25,391
It's very sour white chocolate.

12
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:27,591
"Taruto Urai (53), Urai Confections President" -Hey, hey. Don't tell me

13
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:30,591
that you want me to test taste the chocolate.

14
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:33,791
You know that I don't take to sour things, do you?

15
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,791
I've been telling you from before

16
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,091
that I'm in charge of the sweet stuff

17
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:39,991
and you, the vice-president's in charge of the sour stuff.

18
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:44,191
Don't take my word for it, but I promise it's good so taste one.

19
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:47,691
"Hoshie Urai (49), Taruto Urai's wife" -Maybe you'd be okay with it by now.

20
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:49,691
No way.

21
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:51,791
I got sick over the citrus fruit cake

22
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:55,091
that you made for fun the other day too, didn't I?

23
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:57,591
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:01,191
I was just trying to remedy your hate for sour things.

25
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:04,291
By the way, did you think up something

26
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,891
for my speech tonight?

27
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:08,991
For March 14th?

28
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:10,191
The kind of idea

29
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:12,891
that will surprise the guests that we have invited to the party

30
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:16,591
out of their wits and liven it up?

31
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:19,191
I've got one such idea,

32
00:01:19,191 --> 00:01:20,391
would you like to try it out?

33
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:23,791
I'm sure everyone will really be surprised.

34
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,091
Something that'll make their eyes pop out?

35
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:30,091
Yes, I think you yourself will be very surprised too.

36
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:34,891
So much that you'll die.

37
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,691
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

38
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:40,091
Tears are start of all dramas.

39
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:41,691
In exchange for sour chocolate

40
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:43,591
is the aroma of a crime on White Day.

41
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:45,291
He sees through the one and only truth.

42
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,291
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

43
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,291
His name is Detective Conan!

44
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:33,687
"White Day of Betrayal (Part 1)".

45
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:50,387
Darn! Out of the 24-hour time limit that I had,

46
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:52,287
I've only got less than an hour!

47
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:55,587
I've got to search up the spy within the amount of time left

48
00:03:55,587 --> 00:03:57,387
or everything will go down the drain!

49
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:01,887
Just what do you think you're doing?

50
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:03,187
The four blocks in this area

51
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:05,487
are being closed off! Hurry!

52
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:08,587
Hey, is that information you got verified?

53
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:10,887
Yes! The spy is black!

54
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:13,187
Don't make me repeat myself!

55
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,387
If the spy's black...

56
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:18,387
Then why are all the chocolates white?

57
00:04:20,987 --> 00:04:23,787
Sour!

58
00:04:25,187 --> 00:04:28,287
This time it's an even sourer spy choco white!

59
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,287
It's popular and in stores now!

60
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:32,287
Don't forget the original spy choco black too.

61
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:35,287
Your dad's pretty good, Ran.

62
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:37,887
Moreover, he's acting together with his beloved Yoko

63
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:39,687
on a TV AD too.

64
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:41,887
He must be on cloud nine!

65
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:43,187
Nope.

66
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:45,887
He keeps complaining that his face is barely recognizable

67
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:47,387
because of the hat and sunglasses he wore.

68
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,787
But, thanks to that commercial,

69
00:04:49,787 --> 00:04:54,087
we were invited to the White Day party by its manufacturer, right?

70
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:55,687
Was the party tonight?

71
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:59,487
Yes. At Haido City Hotel starting from 18:00.

72
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:03,487
I hear that the company was established on March 14th.

73
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:06,887
Talking about White Day,

74
00:05:06,887 --> 00:05:09,287
did you receive anything, Ran?

75
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:11,787
A gift in return from Shinichi.

76
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:18,587
You gave him hand-made Valentine's chocolate too, didn't you, Ran?

77
00:05:18,587 --> 00:05:20,587
Well, I did sort of give it to him.

78
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,387
Or rather, he ate it without permission.

79
00:05:25,387 --> 00:05:28,387
I wonder if Kygyoku's going to give me something,

80
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:30,187
in return on White Day.

81
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:34,187
It seems that boys are not as concerned about it as girls, though.

82
00:05:34,187 --> 00:05:38,587
They may not even know about White Day.

83
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:39,987
True.

84
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:43,387
If you give somebody chocolate on Valentine's Day,

85
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:46,187
you get a return gift on March 14th!

86
00:05:46,187 --> 00:05:48,387
That's good news.

87
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:50,287
Officer Sato!

88
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:53,487
Okay, then, Officer Takagi!

89
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:57,487
I didn't get any chocolate from you, Officer Sato.

90
00:05:57,487 --> 00:06:00,487
I was really waiting for one and yet...

91
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:02,387
I gave you, remember?

92
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:05,587
On February 14th when we were on a stakeout.

93
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:06,587
You want?

94
00:06:08,587 --> 00:06:10,487
You mean that?

95
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,187
It was half-eaten!

96
00:06:12,187 --> 00:06:13,387
Officer Takagi.

97
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:14,887
Chocolates like crimes,

98
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:17,187
have no big or small or half eaten to them, you know.

99
00:06:17,187 --> 00:06:19,087
About that...

100
00:06:21,787 --> 00:06:23,287
Hey, everyone!

101
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:25,587
Have you finished the investigation and asking questions?

102
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:27,087
Mr. Shiratori!

103
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:31,887
What's with that box?

104
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:35,887
It's a White Day gift I'm giving to Ms. Kobayashi.

105
00:06:35,887 --> 00:06:40,387
Well, I was trying to make up my mind on whether to give her

106
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:42,387
biscuits, candies, white chocolates or marshmallows

107
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:44,787
that the box kept getting larger.

108
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:46,687
I'll see you all then!

109
00:06:48,587 --> 00:06:50,387
Just as would be expected of Mr. Shiratori.

110
00:06:50,387 --> 00:06:52,587
He's got love.

111
00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:55,287
In the meantime, I wonder what Officer Takagi was doing.

112
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:59,587
I'm sorry, I'm so thoughtless!

"Mouri Detective Agency"

114
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:05,187
What's the matter, Conan?

115
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:07,387
I'm sorry, I forgot something.

116
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:09,087
Go ahead on the cab without me!

117
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:14,787
Come to think of it,

118
00:07:14,787 --> 00:07:16,487
are you over with your cold already?

119
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:18,187
You were a bit nasal, right?

120
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,587
Yep, I'm fine already!

122

What? Yoko Okino can't come?

123
00:07:27,287 --> 00:07:28,687
Are you serious?

124
00:07:28,687 --> 00:07:30,587
Yes, we got word just a while ago

125
00:07:30,587 --> 00:07:31,887
because the take for the drama

126
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:34,287
is taking longer than expected, so she can't come.

127
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,687
And I brought her a White Day gift too.

128
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:39,087
What's that about?

129
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:42,287
Mom nor I got one yet.

130
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:44,787
Hello there, great detective.

131
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:48,987
Welcome to Urai Confections 8th Anniversary Party.

132
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:53,587
Who may I ask are you?

133
00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:56,887
I'm President of Urai Confections, Taruto Urai.

134
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:59,287
I think we've never met before.

135
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:01,287
President?

136
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:04,887
And this is my wife and vice-president.

137
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:08,287
I'm Hoshie. It's an honor to see you,

138
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,587
Mr. Sleeping Kogoro.

139
00:08:10,587 --> 00:08:13,387
Well, hello.

140
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:22,187
How gorgeous!

141
00:08:22,187 --> 00:08:23,687
Really.

142
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:25,587
Look at all the people, Conan.

143
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:26,587
Yeah.

144
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,087
Come along!

145
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:30,987
It's a buffet,

146
00:08:30,987 --> 00:08:34,687
so help yourself to the food and drinks as you like.

147
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:36,087
Yes, ma'am!

148
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,287
Come over here, Ran.

149
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:43,787
It's all kinds of food all you can eat!

150
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:45,387
You'd better make yourself a plate right away too!

151
00:08:45,387 --> 00:08:46,987
Fried prawns, fried prawns!

152
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:48,687
Hey, Dad, hold it.

153
00:08:48,687 --> 00:08:50,987
Pops, control yourself.

154
00:08:53,587 --> 00:08:54,687
It's good!

155
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:56,487
Just as expected of the Haido City Hotel,

156
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:58,187
the food is top class too!

157
00:08:58,187 --> 00:09:00,987
I wonder what they have in store for us.

158
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:02,087
What?

159
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:03,987
It's President Urai!

160
00:09:03,987 --> 00:09:05,587
According to Sonoko,

161
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:09,287
he does something interesting at every party.

162
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:10,787
He does magic,

163
00:09:10,787 --> 00:09:13,387
or come out wearing the stuffed animal clothes that he wore on TV ads,

164
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:17,387
or even do plays in the spotlight at times.

165
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:21,387
So, I think everybody's anticipating what he'll do.

166
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:24,887
A skit...

167
00:09:28,387 --> 00:09:30,687
I've got to say that the commercial was great, involving great acting.

168
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:31,887
Yes.

169
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:34,687
I'm glad and was right to have used you to make that commercial.

170
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,087
Well, well!

171
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,887
The fact is, I asked Yoko to use you

172
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:45,587
as her partner investigator.

173
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:49,587
Well, she's into me, you see, so...

174
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:51,187
Not true.

175
00:09:51,187 --> 00:09:52,187
Gosh.

176
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:53,187
Now, I'd like to introduce

177
00:09:53,187 --> 00:09:55,487
one of the star actors of the present commercial.

178
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:58,787
We'd like the great Detective Kogoro Mouri to say a few words!

179
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:06,787
Well, hello there, everyone.

180
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:10,187
-That's right, Ran. -Yes?

181
00:10:10,187 --> 00:10:11,987
Would you like me to read your palm?

182
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:15,087
Palm reading?

183
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:18,587
I didn't know that you could read palms.

184
00:10:18,587 --> 00:10:21,287
My, I read yours every time

185
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,587
before I wake you up in the morning.

186
00:10:24,587 --> 00:10:27,687
Your lifeline is pretty short, so be careful

187
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:29,487
that you don't pass on before your time comes.

188
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:31,087
Hey, hey.

189
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:33,987
Well, talking of Spy Chocolates,

190
00:10:33,987 --> 00:10:36,987
I would like to tell you a bit

191
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:41,687
about the special jobs I goofed on so far as a detective.

192
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:46,187
My, Ran, you're very lucky, aren't you?

193
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,587
You have a straight line going from right bottom of your palm

194
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:51,287
to the bottom of your little finger.

195
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:53,387
I usually win at lotteries.

196
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,487
So...

197
00:10:57,487 --> 00:11:00,487
how... how's my love life?

198
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:08,087
Well, your marriage line is sideways in the shape of a Y.

199
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:09,987
This means that you have to overcome many obstacles

200
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:12,187
in order to get together with the one you love.

201
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:15,187
You're going to be cornered into a doomed state of love.

202
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:17,687
Hey! Hey! Hey!

203
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:20,087
Is it working?

204
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:21,987
Yes, I'm listening!

205
00:11:21,987 --> 00:11:24,187
No, you.

206
00:11:24,187 --> 00:11:26,787
Yeah, I think so.

207
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,887
But, finally after a dramatic turn of the tables,

208
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:33,887
you two may become a couple,

209
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:36,987
so try not to get into too many fights with your boyfriend.

210
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:37,987
Okay.

211
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:54,087
Hey, what is it, Dear?

212
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:56,787
Is this supposed to be your mystery skit?

213
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,387
Detective Mouri, come here, please!

214
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:07,287
I guess it's showtime for you.

215
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:09,587
Yes?

216
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:13,587
Why didn't they tell me beforehand?

217
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:17,587
Come on, he really looks like he's dead.

218
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:25,787
So, the estimated time of death is 19:54.

219
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,187
From my long experience as a detective

220
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:29,087
and if my premonition is correct,

221
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:33,787
the culprit is here without a doubt!

222
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:39,387
And what after this?

223
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:41,287
President Urai?

224
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:43,887
Hello! Hey!

225
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:47,387
He can't answer no matter how much you call him.

226
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:49,687
Because he's not breathing.

227
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:53,287
He... he's dead? For real?

228
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:56,587
Hey. You're joking, aren't you?

229
00:12:56,587 --> 00:12:59,487
Dear? Dear?

230
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,687
Dear!

231
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:04,587
His mouth smelled like almond.

232
00:13:04,587 --> 00:13:06,787
Cyanide compound poisoning.

233
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,887
He's been poisoned.

234
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:18,531
The victim is Mr. Taruto Urai, age 53,

235
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,331
the president of Urai Confections,

236
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:23,631
and the host of this party.

237
00:13:23,631 --> 00:13:26,331
I heard from the coroner that he was poisoned.

238
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:28,631
Yes, sir. He died from acute drug poisoning

239
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:31,031
by a cyanide compound.

240
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:34,431
So, when the president collapsed,

241
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:38,131
Conan, Ran and you, his wife,

242
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:40,431
who is the vice president of Urai Confections,

243
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:43,831
were the only three near him?

244
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:46,431
Yes, that's right.

245
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:48,731
I think it was just when Mr. Mouri went up to the podium

246
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:51,131
to deliver his speech.

247
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,331
Yes.

248
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:56,131
My husband suddenly let out a loud groan and fell to the floor.

249
00:13:56,131 --> 00:13:58,331
He hasn't moved since.

250
00:13:58,331 --> 00:13:59,331
If I remember correctly,

251
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:03,931
the one who was right beside the president at that time was you.

252
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:07,831
Yes. I was palm reading for Ran.

253
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:08,931
Palm reading?

254
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,831
Is it true?

255
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:12,031
Yes.

256
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:14,931
Mrs. Urai held my left hand with both her hands

257
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:16,431
and read my palms.

258
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,131
If both her hands were being used,

259
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:24,331
she couldn't have made him drink the poison with her hands.

260
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:29,131
Did Mrs. Urai call out to her husband back then?

261
00:14:29,131 --> 00:14:31,931
Saying something like drink something or eat something.

262
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:33,831
No, not especially.

263
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,031
But while she was reading your palm,

264
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:39,131
Mrs. Urai said at one point,

265
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:42,631
"Is it working?".

266
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,931
Working?

267
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:48,231
At first I thought she was talking to me,

268
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:51,131
but I later found out that she was talking to her husband.

269
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:53,531
It's because he looked dazed out

270
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:56,431
when Mr. Mouri was giving his speech.

271
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:59,431
But, the president's answer back then

272
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,931
was sort of strange.

273
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:03,231
Strange?

274
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:06,631
He didn't answer "It's working" or "It's not working"

275
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:10,331
but rather, "Yeah, I think so" was his answer.

276
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:11,531
I see.

277
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:13,031
It's true that the answer is a strange one,

278
00:15:13,031 --> 00:15:16,631
if the question was whether listening to my speech was working or not.

279
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:18,931
He was probably dazed out and not really listening,

280
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:22,231
so he answered ambiguously.

281
00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:24,631
My husband was scheduled to make

282
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:27,631
a serious announcement after Mr. Mouri's speech.

283
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:29,431
A serious speech?

284
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:30,831
Yes.

285
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:34,131
About divorcing me and splitting the company into two.

286
00:15:35,531 --> 00:15:37,531
Is that true?

287
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:38,731
Yes.

288
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:41,731
Urai Confections have become large enough,

289
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:43,231
and my husband and I have been having a lot of arguments

290
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:46,331
because of differences in management policies.

291
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:49,031
Actually, my husband had pleaded and cried

292
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,531
asking me to think it over, though.

293
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:53,531
"I don't mind splitting the company up

294
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:55,531
but please don't divorce me.

295
00:15:55,531 --> 00:15:58,331
I can't live without you", he said.

296
00:15:58,331 --> 00:16:00,731
Which means, don't tell me...

297
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:03,031
He committed suicide from grief

298
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:05,031
could be another viewpoint.

299
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:08,231
If so, it's a great disappointment.

300
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:09,531
I'm a professional when it comes to sour tastes

301
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:11,231
while my husband is an expert on sweet-tasting things.

302
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:14,831
Just when I thought he had convinced himself

303
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:17,731
that we go our own way at what we excel in...

304
00:16:17,731 --> 00:16:20,731
Come to think of it, my friend once told me

305
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,231
that the president as well as his wife

306
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,831
have won the confectionery contest.

307
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,231
No, my husband has.

308
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:30,231
I came in second place.

309
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:33,331
I've never won the contest.

310
00:16:33,331 --> 00:16:35,031
But...

311
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:36,131
Never mind that,

312
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:37,831
but if you're going to body search me,

313
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,031
will you do so quickly?

314
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:44,331
If anyone were to give my husband poison,

315
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:47,831
there could be no likely one than me who was right beside him.

316
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:50,331
If so, I may still have the poison

317
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:53,131
that would serve as evidence on me, right?

318
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:55,031
Yes, well...

319
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:59,231
I would appreciate it if you would body check me

320
00:16:59,231 --> 00:17:02,131
in the staff room beyond that door over there.

321
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:05,031
Because I'm sure that at the entrance of this hall there

322
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:06,231
are a lot of people from the press

323
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:08,831
who have heard about this incident gathered around.

324
00:17:08,831 --> 00:17:12,331
If they see an officer taking me out from there,

325
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,031
they may think that I'm being escorted to the station or something.

326
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,131
I see.

327
00:17:18,131 --> 00:17:20,131
Officer Sato, take care of her for me.

328
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:21,431
Yes, sir!

329
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:22,731
Shall we?

330
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:25,331
Excuse me, please let us through.

331
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:33,131
Are you all right?

332
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:38,231
I shouldn't have worn such high heels like this.

333
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:40,731
Shall I lend you my shoulder?

334
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:42,331
I'm fine.

335
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:45,031
I just sprained my ankle.

336
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,031
Let's get it over with, okay?

337
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:55,431
Inspector Megure.

338
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:58,431
I'll take it back with me and check it in detail,

339
00:17:58,431 --> 00:18:01,631
but there seem to be no traces of poison

340
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:04,031
in the food or drinks here on the table.

341
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:05,531
I see.

342
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:08,531
Well, I don't think he drank from the lemon tea

343
00:18:08,531 --> 00:18:11,131
that his wife was drinking.

344
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,131
Yeah.

345
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:15,031
The president was known to hate sour things.

346
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:17,031
I see.

347
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,931
Are you hungry?

348
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:27,531
Yeah, I haven't eaten anything after breakfast

349
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:29,731
and I was summoned here

350
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:31,631
just when I was about to have dinner, you see.

351
00:18:31,631 --> 00:18:36,431
But, doesn't your wife always make lunch for you, Inspector?

352
00:18:36,431 --> 00:18:38,831
Well, just before leaving the house,

353
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:41,131
I had a fight with Midori, you see.

354
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:43,031
Like I just said,

355
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:45,631
don't you have anything you need to give me today?

356
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,931
So, I'm asking you, what is it?

357
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:50,731
Well, it's so stupid,

358
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:52,631
so don't ask me what it was.

359
00:18:57,731 --> 00:19:01,231
That's the gift that we passed out for this White Day party.

360
00:19:01,231 --> 00:19:04,231
Would you like me to give you one?

361
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:05,631
No, thanks.

362
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:08,231
White Day? What's that?

363
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,931
It's judgment day when the extent

364
00:19:10,931 --> 00:19:12,431
of the love your boyfriend has for you

365
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:14,431
will be exposed in broad daylight.

366
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:17,531
First, you casually give him a Valentine's Day gift

367
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,731
and exactly a month afterwards on March 14th

368
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:21,031
if he gives you a gift in return,

369
00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:24,831
the bells of days of romance after romance will resound.

370
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,431
But, if you get nothing, then the footsteps of broken love

371
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,531
will close in.

372
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:30,331
Footsteps of broken love?

373
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:33,631
I'm sorry, I'm so thoughtless!

374
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:39,631
Are you done with that heel?

375
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:43,031
Yes. I'll check the other one then.

376
00:19:43,031 --> 00:19:46,131
No, no. I've got to concentrate on my job!

377
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:48,531
What?

378
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:50,331
A run-up murder?

379
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:53,731
Yes, exactly, Inspector!

380
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:54,731
From what I hear,

381
00:19:54,731 --> 00:19:56,931
the president's been putting on performances

382
00:19:56,931 --> 00:20:00,031
to surprise the guests every year at the party.

383
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:06,431
Things like magic, masquerades or skits.

384
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:07,431
In other words,

385
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:09,931
the first time the president shouted and collapsed,

386
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:11,931
it was a skit.

387
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:15,231
It could be that he was counting on me

388
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,031
to play the part as detective in his mystery story.

389
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:22,031
But, of course he had no idea that he would be killed right after that.

390
00:20:22,031 --> 00:20:23,831
Then, who's the first person

391
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:26,131
that ran up to him right after he collapsed?

392
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:28,131
Mrs. Urai.

393
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:31,731
She bent down close to the president and said,

394
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:36,531
"Hey, what is it, dear? Is this supposed to be your mystery skit?"

395
00:20:36,531 --> 00:20:38,631
Don't tell me that she gave him the poison then!

396
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:41,431
You mean she put it directly into his mouth?

397
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:45,331
Yes. In other words, only his wife

398
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:47,531
who knew of the contents of the skit could've done it.

399
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:48,831
My, my.

400
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:52,431
To think that a great detective like you would utter such nonsense...

401
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,931
You were up on the podium and probably couldn't see,

402
00:20:57,931 --> 00:21:00,431
but my husband after collapsing

403
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:04,031
didn't even twitch nor utter a word.

404
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:07,931
If I did administer the poison to him then,

405
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:12,431
wouldn't he has struggled and groaned in pain?

406
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:14,831
Hey, Ran! How was it?

407
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:17,231
You were nearby then, weren't you?

408
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:18,931
Just as she says,

409
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:20,431
he didn't move at all

410
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:22,731
and looked to really be dead.

411
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:24,931
In other words, your deduction right now

412
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:26,931
is the goofed up version that you always talk about

413
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:31,731
before really getting down to the nitty-gritty real stuff.

414
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:34,131
Goofed up version?

415
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:36,831
I remember this part well, but...

416
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:45,631
Hey, where did you blow the ash to?

417
00:21:45,631 --> 00:21:48,131
And how did the body check go?

418
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:49,931
Yes, sir. No trace of poison

419
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:53,331
nor of her having had possessed poison was detected.

420
00:21:53,331 --> 00:21:55,131
Most naturally.

421
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:57,731
If so, this is...

422
00:21:57,731 --> 00:21:59,431
Inspector!

423
00:21:59,431 --> 00:22:01,731
A bottle of poison and a case of wafers

424
00:22:01,731 --> 00:22:05,631
were found in the glove compartment of the president's car.

425
00:22:05,631 --> 00:22:09,031
By wafers, you mean the thing that you wrap powdered medicine in

426
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:10,531
that melts immediately in your mouth?

427
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:13,331
Yes, sir. I reported that to the coroner

428
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:15,331
and he told me that he found a melted wafer

429
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:17,831
on the molar of the president's mouth.

430
00:22:17,831 --> 00:22:22,031
I see. He hid the wafer with poison in his pocket,

431
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:24,231
and drank it when he thought it was appropriate.

432
00:22:24,231 --> 00:22:26,731
So, can we conclude that it's suicide?

433
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:33,931
I'm sure that Mrs. Urai is the culprit.

434
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:36,331
However, how on earth did she do it?

435
00:23:58,231 --> 00:24:01,131
"Next episode" -What was the menu for tonight, then?

436
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:06,031
You must've bought the ingredients already, right?

437
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:07,331
You couldn't have known beforehand

438
00:24:07,331 --> 00:24:10,331
that something like this was going to happen, right?

439
00:24:10,331 --> 00:24:12,431
Oh no! Dad's cigarette!

440
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:15,131
Oh no, it's burnt.

441
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:18,431
That's why Mrs. Urai deliberately went pass there.

442
00:24:18,431 --> 00:24:22,731
There's a very miracle trick!

443
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:23,931
Next Conan,

444
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:27,131
"White Day of Betrayal (Part 2)".

445
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:46,531
Next Conan's Hint:

446
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:48,231
"Lemon".

447
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:50,231
Inspector, it'll become sour if you squeeze the lemon!

448
00:24:50,231 --> 00:24:51,231
You idiot!

449
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:53,231
You go on and squeeze some brains out of your head!
