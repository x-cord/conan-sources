1
00:00:01,453 --> 00:00:02,852
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,853 --> 00:00:04,652
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:07,252
The relationship between master and apprentice has been broken.

4
00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:09,252
But the story of saury will reconcile them.

5
00:00:09,253 --> 00:00:10,652
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:12,252
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:14,053
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:57,041
Sand and fish under the water.

9
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:59,141
The end of clouds and waters.

10
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:00,841
What we eat and where we sleep.

11
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:04,342
Where we sleep...

12
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:08,741
What we eat and where we sleep...

13
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:10,241
And where you live!

14
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:13,441
5-39 Beika Town!

15
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:16,441
I'm not talking about your home.

16
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:17,741
It's the next line.

17
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:19,341
You forgot it already?

18
00:02:19,342 --> 00:02:20,841
It's been almost for a week.

19
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:22,741
I can't believe he still haven't memorize the lines.

20
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,042
Yabura-koji and Bura-koji.

21
00:02:27,742 --> 00:02:29,342
Paipo, paipo.

22
00:02:30,342 --> 00:02:32,241
Paipo, paipo!

23
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:35,541
Paipo, Paipo's hooligan.

24
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:39,441
Hooligan's Shaolin boxing.

25
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:42,241
It's Paipo, Paipo's Shuringan.

26
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:44,541
Shuringan's Gurindai.

27
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:47,541
Gurindai's Popokopi and Ponpokona.

28
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:51,241
Now, the name is Chokyumei Chosuke.

29
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:52,641
Mouri,

30
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:55,241
maybe you want to forget about it this time.

31
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:58,441
I don't think you are the kind of person to do memorization.

32
00:02:58,442 --> 00:03:00,841
Don't say that, Inspector.

33
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:03,541
Well, I think I know why you're doing this.

34
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:06,841
It's about all-you-can-drink, isn't it?

35
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:09,341
I understand, but it's not worth embarrassing yourself.

36
00:03:09,342 --> 00:03:12,341
Well, it's not that.

37
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:14,941
Mr. Mouri, are you going to the hall already?

38
00:03:14,942 --> 00:03:16,641
You're all pumped up, aren't you?

39
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:17,941
"Nagaro Uwajima (50)" -The famous Detective Mouri

40
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:21,741
is going to do rakugo storytelling. People are talking about it, you know.

41
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:23,742
He's Nagaro Uwajima, my facilitator.

42
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:27,141
Did you hear that, Inspector?

43
00:03:27,142 --> 00:03:29,641
Would you still say that I should quit rakugo storytelling?

44
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,541
All right, all right.

45
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:33,541
I'll teach you a story, but it's a short one,

46
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:34,842
so you can memorize it easily.

47
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:37,441
Dear! Please look ahead while you're driving.

48
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:39,142
There's no deer on the road.

49
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:44,242
Oh dear, you're talking about that deer.

50
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:48,042
Now, that's the right one for him.

51
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:55,242
"Meguro Saury."

52
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:01,442
Hey, it's Master Manrakutei Ichimatsu.

53
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:05,641
Master Ichimatsu, are you ready for today?

54
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:07,641
"Manrakutei Ichimatsu (55)" -Yes, Nagaro.

55
00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:09,241
No worries.

56
00:04:09,242 --> 00:04:10,842
He is my childhood friend.

57
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:14,541
Who was that boy earlier?

58
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:17,141
Well, he wanted to be my apprentice,

59
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:20,441
but I told him to come after graduating from school.

60
00:04:20,442 --> 00:04:23,141
Master, tea is ready.

61
00:04:23,142 --> 00:04:24,641
Hi, Uwajima.

62
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:26,741
Nagaro, why don't you have tea with us?

63
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:28,741
And you too, please.

64
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:31,841
Well, what is the master of rakugo storytelling doing here?

65
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:33,741
He's a helper for this restaurant.

66
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:35,441
A helper?

67
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,141
Who is that lady then?

68
00:04:37,142 --> 00:04:39,541
Spring has finally come to master.

69
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:42,142
And now he is out from his bachelor life.

70
00:04:46,842 --> 00:04:49,841
"Miya Meguro (30)" -What kind of fish is that?

71
00:04:49,842 --> 00:04:51,241
It's saury.

72
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:53,841
That's a lot of saury.

73
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:55,641
I get it.

74
00:04:55,642 --> 00:05:00,141
Master, your storytelling for today is "Meguro Saury", isn't it?

75
00:05:00,142 --> 00:05:01,541
Yes.

76
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:04,641
Your "Meguro Saury" is amazing.

77
00:05:04,642 --> 00:05:09,641
People are going to come here to eat saury after your performance.

78
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,741
That's what it's for, isn't it?

79
00:05:11,742 --> 00:05:14,441
Hey, what is "Meguro Saury"?

80
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:17,042
"Meguro Saury" is a rakugo story.

81
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,741
Long ago, there was a king who was brought up protected from the world.

82
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:23,341
One day, he went out to Meguro to hunt birds.

83
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:25,641
There, a farmer served him a meal which was a saury,

84
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:27,941
which he had never eaten before in his life.

85
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:30,341
Being so impressed with its taste,

86
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:32,941
the king ordered a saury again when he went to a different place.

87
00:05:32,942 --> 00:05:34,641
However, the saury that was served

88
00:05:34,642 --> 00:05:38,741
was mealy and flaky because his servant steamed and broke it into flakes

89
00:05:38,742 --> 00:05:41,741
to make it safe and healthy to eat.

90
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,841
Since the saury tasted so different,

91
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:46,541
the king asked what kind of saury it was.

92
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:50,141
"It was saury that just landed in Boshu", said the servant.

93
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,842
And then, the king said...

94
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:55,542
-"Meguro Saury is the best!" -"Meguro Saury is the best!"

95
00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:57,941
What happened?

96
00:05:57,942 --> 00:05:58,942
It hurts...

97
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:01,341
I think I cut my finger with the broken cup.

98
00:06:01,342 --> 00:06:03,142
You're bleeding!

99
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:08,141
Hey, I'm alright.

100
00:06:08,142 --> 00:06:10,641
People are watching us.

101
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:12,441
What are you talking about?

102
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:13,741
You're going to be on stage tonight.

103
00:06:13,742 --> 00:06:15,642
You have to take care of yourself.

104
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:30,741
Thank you for the tea, Miya.

105
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:35,341
Master, the party after the show is at Meruhen at 7 o'clock, okay?

106
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:38,841
All right. Meruhen at 7 o'clock, I got it.

107
00:06:38,842 --> 00:06:41,542
Okay, we're going to head to the hall now.

108
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:46,341
She is the wife of Master Ichimatsu's apprentice?

109
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:49,541
Yes. His name is Manrakutei Kisaburo.

110
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,841
He is a famous rakugo storyteller, right?

111
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:54,141
She's his wife?

112
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:56,241
She's actually divorced with that man

113
00:06:56,242 --> 00:07:00,041
and Master Ichimatsu is looking after her now.

114
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,641
This is just my guess,

115
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:05,841
but it looks like Master Ichimatsu has been helping her out financially.

116
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,741
What a gentleman he is.

117
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:12,841
Well, I'm more worried about him because she might just be using him.

118
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:14,541
What do you mean by that?

119
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:18,641
How could a wife be intimate with someone who ousted her husband?

120
00:07:18,642 --> 00:07:22,041
People are saying that Master Ichimatsu has made a lot of money.

121
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,541
So I thought that she's getting close to him just for that.

122
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:28,241
Looks can be deceiving, is that what you mean?

123
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:32,942
I guess people are humane only in rakugo stories.

124
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,442
"Talent Show."

125
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:45,641
Paipo, Paipo's Shuringan.

126
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:48,542
Shuringan's Shuringan's...

127
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:51,141
The short one!

128
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:52,841
Change it to the short story.

129
00:07:52,842 --> 00:07:54,541
Oh, okay.

130
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:58,441
There's no deer on the road.

131
00:07:58,442 --> 00:07:59,941
Gosh!

132
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:02,141
How could he say the ending first?

133
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:03,742
Look ahead! Look ahead!

134
00:08:05,842 --> 00:08:06,941
Look ahead?

135
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:08,442
Oh, I see!

136
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:12,641
Dear, please look ahead while you're driving.

137
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,242
There's no deer on the road.

138
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:22,941
Master Ichimatsu, please.

139
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:23,942
Okay.

140
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:26,742
So, how did it go, Mr. Mouri?

141
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:31,141
I didn't know I was that talented.

142
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:33,741
You should've seen the way people were laughing.

143
00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:36,941
They were laughing at you, not your story.

144
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:37,942
Is that right?

145
00:08:37,943 --> 00:08:41,042
Maybe you should teach me how to do rakugo storytelling?

146
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:53,241
Is this a saury?

147
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:55,541
Tell me where you bought it.

148
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:57,941
It is from the riverside of Nihonbashi.

149
00:08:57,942 --> 00:09:02,541
I chose the freshest one, my Lord.

150
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,042
You dunderhead. Meguro saury is the best.

151
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:19,841
Master, we're going to drink all night!

152
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:21,841
Next time, I'll get the first prize!

153
00:09:21,842 --> 00:09:24,341
Hey, hey. He's going to do it again?

154
00:09:24,342 --> 00:09:27,741
Excuse me, my friend may be visiting me.

155
00:09:27,742 --> 00:09:30,041
So why don't you go ahead?

156
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:32,741
There's some work left for me too,

157
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:34,942
so could you wait for me outside just a little while, please?

158
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:52,442
Uwajima is a busy man.

159
00:09:57,242 --> 00:09:59,541
Looks like he's done.

160
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:02,142
Master, we'll head out to the party place now.

161
00:10:03,342 --> 00:10:05,641
Sorry to keep you waiting long.

162
00:10:05,642 --> 00:10:07,441
Where's Master Ichimatsu?

163
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:10,841
His friend hasn't come yet, so he said he'll catch up later.

164
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:12,042
I see.

165
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:17,141
This is Megure.

166
00:10:17,142 --> 00:10:19,842
What? Master Ichimatsu has been stabbed?

167
00:10:24,642 --> 00:10:26,341
It was an anonymous call?

168
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:27,541
It was a man's voice,

169
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:30,541
saying that Master Ichimatsu had been stabbed in this dressing room.

170
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,741
It's a lot of blood.

171
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:35,541
He was lying unconscious when he was found.

172
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,441
Is he going to make it?

173
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:38,742
I don't know.

174
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,541
What is this?

175
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,642
Megurono?

176
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:50,141
Isn't that about the rakugo storytelling, "Meguro Saury"?

177
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:53,941
He wanted to write "Meguro Saury", but he couldn't finish it.

178
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:56,541
Speaking of Meguro, I need you to see this.

179
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:57,841
Look at the handle of this knife.

180
00:10:57,842 --> 00:11:00,841
It's kind of scraped off, but it says "Meguro".

181
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:02,241
Meguro...

182
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:04,041
Meguro Saury...

183
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:05,341
Saury Lunch...

184
00:11:05,342 --> 00:11:08,541
Inspector Megure, I got it!

185
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,441
The culprit is...

186
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:12,341
Miya.

187
00:11:12,342 --> 00:11:14,341
She's the lady at Meguro Restaurant.

188
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:15,941
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,141
It was me.

190
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:19,142
It was me who did it.

191
00:11:20,342 --> 00:11:22,642
This is your knife, right?

192
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:25,042
Yes.

193
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:26,941
But why did you do it?

194
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:29,241
Let me explain instead.

195
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:30,741
You had some financial trouble.

196
00:11:30,742 --> 00:11:33,541
You owed Master Ichimatsu money,

197
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:37,341
but if you kill him, you don't have to pay it back.

198
00:11:37,342 --> 00:11:39,541
Wasn't that what you thought?

199
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:41,241
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,441
-Chiba. -Yes, sir.

201
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:44,541
To the station, please.

202
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:45,841
Wait a minute!

203
00:11:45,842 --> 00:11:47,541
She didn't do anything!

204
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,242
Excuse me, who are you?

205
00:11:52,742 --> 00:11:54,341
You are...

206
00:11:54,342 --> 00:11:56,741
Manrakutei Kisaburo.

207
00:11:56,742 --> 00:11:58,541
Master Ichimatsu's apprentice.

208
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:00,841
"Manrakutei Kisaburo (30)" -It was me who did it.

209
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:04,841
I'm Manrakutei Kisaburo, the one that was ousted a year ago.

210
00:12:04,842 --> 00:12:09,041
I stole the knife from Miya's restaurant

211
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:11,441
and I stabbed Master Ichimatsu.

212
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:13,041
Why did you do that?

213
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:16,441
He may not be your master now, but at least he was before, right?

214
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:17,741
Inspector!

215
00:12:17,742 --> 00:12:20,541
He is lying just to protect me.

216
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,441
It was me who did it.

217
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,741
I became pretty popular and got bigheaded.

218
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:26,941
So I skipped a show, had some debts gambling.

219
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:30,441
I also had some love affairs.

220
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:34,441
But I don't think he should have kicked me out!

221
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:35,941
So that's your motive?

222
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:37,341
That's a lie.

223
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:40,241
He loves rakugo storytelling more than anything.

224
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:43,541
He must be longing to come back on stage again.

225
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:45,541
Such a person wouldn't do that kind of thing.

226
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:49,041
Then how do you explain these words that master wrote?

227
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:50,941
"Meguro Saury."

228
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:53,241
It's my favourite story.

229
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:54,641
Then it's been cleared.

230
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:56,341
Mr. Mouri, no!

231
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,741
He didn't do anything!

232
00:12:57,742 --> 00:12:59,641
It was me! I did it!

233
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:01,641
You shut up, got that?

234
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:03,341
These two think that the other is the culprit

235
00:13:03,342 --> 00:13:05,741
and they're protecting each other.

236
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:09,242
Anyway, what's the meaning of this message?

237
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:14,942
Come to think of it, Master Ichimatsu said...

238
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:19,241
Excuse me, my friend may be visiting me.

239
00:13:19,242 --> 00:13:21,441
So why don't you go ahead?

240
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:24,142
Who was the master waiting for, anyway?

241
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:37,941
Party at 7 o'clock.

242
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,241
Meruhen?

243
00:13:40,242 --> 00:13:41,242
Wait a minute!

244
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:46,442
I got it!

245
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:49,942
That must be it!

246
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:58,931
Okay, we will find out the detailed facts in the station.

247
00:13:58,932 --> 00:14:00,232
-Let's go, Chiba. -Yes, sir.

248
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:06,431
What are you doing there?

249
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:07,432
Let's go!

250
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:14,831
Inspector, please wait.

251
00:14:14,832 --> 00:14:18,132
Those two have nothing to do with this crime at all.

252
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:23,931
Kisaburo, you visited Master Ichimatsu's dressing room.

253
00:14:23,932 --> 00:14:28,131
Around the time when we were heading down to Restaurant Meruhen.

254
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:30,532
Probably a little before 7 o'clock.

255
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:36,531
He was already down on the floor.

256
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:40,231
And there, you found a knife that had a familiar name on it.

257
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:44,331
So you thought Miya did it. Am I right?

258
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:46,031
That's why you...

259
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:51,532
On the other hand, Miya saw Kisaburo going into this room.

260
00:14:54,332 --> 00:14:59,232
As soon as he found Master Ichimatsu lying on the floor, he left the room.

261
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:07,131
When she saw this, she thought Kisaburo murdered Master Ichimatsu.

262
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:09,331
You saw me there? Now, I understand.

263
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:12,231
Well, what else could I think?

264
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:15,431
And also, I am your biggest fan.

265
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:18,331
If the police come, I thought I should...

266
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:19,931
I see.

267
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:22,731
But you really thought I killed Master?

268
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:24,431
How could you even think that?

269
00:15:24,432 --> 00:15:26,531
Well, how could you think that I killed him, too?

270
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:29,831
I would never hurt him, ever!

271
00:15:29,832 --> 00:15:31,831
Guys, please!

272
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:35,331
Mouri, who stabbed Master Ichimatsu?

273
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:40,931
Master Ichimatsu actually wrote the name of the murderer on this board.

274
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:43,431
You mean this "Megurono"?

275
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:45,631
This can't be a person's name.

276
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:50,631
Officer Chiba, do you see Master Ichimatsu's bag under the whiteboard?

277
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:53,431
Would you please take the notebook out of it?

278
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:56,832
Now, I would like you to read Master Ichimatsu's schedule for tonight.

279
00:15:59,532 --> 00:16:01,131
Party at 7 o'clock.

280
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:02,132
Naruheso?

281
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:04,731
Naruheso?

282
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:07,731
What is Naruheso?

283
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:10,231
Yeah, it does say "Naruheso".

284
00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:12,531
Now, please remember.

285
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:16,531
Master Ichimatsu cut his right finger. We saw it.

286
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:21,031
He probably used his left hand to write "Meruhen",

287
00:16:21,032 --> 00:16:22,732
but it got deformed.

288
00:16:24,632 --> 00:16:27,832
So "Meruhen" turned into "Naruheso".

289
00:16:29,332 --> 00:16:32,431
Inspector, tilt your head to the side

290
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:34,232
and look at the word on the whiteboard.

291
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:39,231
If you tilt this letter "me", it becomes "na".

292
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,531
Likewise, "gu" becomes "ga".

293
00:16:41,532 --> 00:16:45,531
"Ro" stays the same, but "no" could be a long vowel.

294
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:47,332
Now, guess what we got?

295
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:53,232
Nagaro?

296
00:16:54,732 --> 00:16:57,532
Uwajima, where do you think you're going?

297
00:16:58,932 --> 00:17:00,631
I got some stuff to do so.

298
00:17:00,632 --> 00:17:03,631
Well, you need to hang out with us a little longer.

299
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:07,631
Uwajima, I think Master Ichimatsu wanted to write your name.

300
00:17:07,632 --> 00:17:12,531
Yes, he wanted to tell us that you were the culprit.

301
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,931
Are you kidding?

302
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,331
When did I do it?

303
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:17,731
I didn't have enough time to do it, Mr. Mouri.

304
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:19,831
You know that, right?

305
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:22,732
Officer Chiba, please search at the hole on the ceiling.

306
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:25,332
All right.

307
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,132
There's a bag under the roof.

308
00:17:32,332 --> 00:17:35,731
I asked Conan to search for it a while ago.

309
00:17:35,732 --> 00:17:41,831
It showed that this room and the office are connected under the roof.

310
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:44,231
Now, please check what's inside.

311
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:45,232
Yes, sir.

312
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:52,931
You're selling this at your store.

313
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:54,931
Women usually put this doll in their room

314
00:17:54,932 --> 00:17:57,331
so it looked like a man is with them.

315
00:17:57,332 --> 00:17:59,331
For the sake of their own safety.

316
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:01,031
You actually put this by the window,

317
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:02,431
so it looked like you were doing some work.

318
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:05,331
What you were actually doing during this time,

319
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:07,831
you come into this dressing room through the space under the roof,

320
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:11,331
pick up a knife that you put there beforehand and killed Master.

321
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:12,332
Uwajima...

322
00:18:14,032 --> 00:18:16,631
You joined us like nothing happened,

323
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:18,931
and headed out to Meruhen together.

324
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,131
No. That's nonsense.

325
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,431
It's not me.

326
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:22,432
Where is the evidence?

327
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:25,131
Do you have anything that proves that I stabbed him?

328
00:18:25,132 --> 00:18:28,231
Officer Chiba, do you see the speaker on the wall?

329
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,431
Speaker?

330
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:34,031
-Yes. -Will you search around the speaker?

331
00:18:34,032 --> 00:18:36,831
There should be a MD recorder.

332
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:38,531
A MD recorder?

333
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:39,931
Please take a look.

334
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:43,531
The power is on in order to record what is going on in the hall.

335
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:47,131
Master Ichimatsu asked me something just a while ago.

336
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:49,831
So, how did it go, Mr. Mouri?

337
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:54,131
That means he wasn't listening to my storytelling.

338
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,231
The MD recorder wasn't on.

339
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:57,531
But now it is...

340
00:18:57,532 --> 00:18:58,831
On.

341
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:00,531
Who turned it on?

342
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:01,831
Probably by somebody

343
00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:07,332
who wanted to wiretap Master Ichimatsu's "Meguro Saury".

344
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:10,231
It was on the speaker.

345
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:14,232
Officer Chiba, could you please rewind and play it?

346
00:19:17,632 --> 00:19:21,132
You dunderhead. Meguro saury is the best.

347
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:28,231
Uwajima, recorders today are not like the ones before.

348
00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:31,231
It can record much, much longer.

349
00:19:31,232 --> 00:19:35,131
Officer Chiba, the moment of the incident should be recorded in the tape.

350
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,031
Please fast-forward it to that part.

351
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,032
Yes, sir.

352
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:43,631
Nagaro, what are you doing? Nagaro!

353
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:47,531
Shut up! Getting conceited after being called master!

354
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:50,831
It's all because of you that Miya doesn't listen to me!

355
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:52,531
Stop talking nonsense!

356
00:19:52,532 --> 00:19:55,432
Miya is waiting for Kisaburo to come back.

357
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:57,632
Darn it!

358
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,332
Please stop it!

359
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,731
Stop. It was me.

360
00:20:02,732 --> 00:20:05,831
I stole the knife from Miya's restaurant

361
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:08,032
and I stabbed him.

362
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:21,531
Hey, kid.

363
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:24,231
This is master's recording tape. You can have this.

364
00:20:24,232 --> 00:20:28,331
This has "Meguro Saury", so forget about your MD.

365
00:20:28,332 --> 00:20:31,231
I understand that you like master's storytelling,

366
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:33,231
but you can never record it like that, okay?

367
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,932
Okay! I'm sorry!

368
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:38,931
Miya! Kisaburo!

369
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:40,631
I just got a call from the hospital.

370
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:42,132
They said Master is going to be fine.

371
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:47,931
But, how could you think that I stabbed Master

372
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:50,431
just because you saw me coming out of his room?

373
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:54,031
-Yeah, because you were holding a knife in your hand. -A knife?

374
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:57,531
Conan, the knife she saw might be that.

375
00:20:57,532 --> 00:20:59,732
Yes. I think so, too.

376
00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:06,131
You brought this, right, Kisaburo?

377
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,631
So it was there?

378
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:10,331
It was the freshest saury I found this morning.

379
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:13,931
I got it for Master.

380
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:16,431
You thought this was a knife, didn't you?

381
00:21:16,432 --> 00:21:20,932
It was kind of dark and you had a languishing look on your face.

382
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:25,531
You are so stupid!

383
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:27,831
How could a saury look like a knife?

384
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:30,331
Come on, guys.

385
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,731
In Japanese, you write "autumn", "sword" and "fish",

386
00:21:32,732 --> 00:21:34,031
and you read it as "saury".

387
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:36,131
It's understandable that you made the mistake.

388
00:21:36,132 --> 00:21:39,831
Now, no need to worry about Master Ichimatsu.

389
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:43,531
Why don't you eat that saury together, like you used to do before?

390
00:21:43,532 --> 00:21:45,831
Well, I wouldn't mind that.

391
00:21:45,832 --> 00:21:47,531
Me neither.

392
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:50,531
But we have to go and see Master first.

393
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:55,131
Why don't you ask him to let you work as his apprentice again?

394
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:57,031
You think he'll forgive me?

395
00:21:57,032 --> 00:21:59,231
He will,

396
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:02,732
because he's been waiting for you to come back.

397
00:23:30,232 --> 00:23:32,632
I was daydreaming again.

398
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:42,831
Conan, you're crying because of my story, aren't you?

399
00:23:42,832 --> 00:23:45,731
Storytelling usually gets kids bored and sleepy, but mine doesn't.

400
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:50,131
I think that tells how good I am.

401
00:23:50,132 --> 00:23:51,831
I'm not sleeping

402
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:54,932
because you're sitting where I'm supposed to be sleeping.

403
00:23:58,032 --> 00:23:59,731
"Next Episode."

404
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:02,131
This looks amazing, doesn't it?

405
00:24:02,132 --> 00:24:03,931
The sign looks like a haunted house

406
00:24:03,932 --> 00:24:06,331
which you really like!

407
00:24:06,332 --> 00:24:08,232
Somebody's trying to kill you?

408
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:15,431
Hey, wasn't that the signal just now?

409
00:24:15,432 --> 00:24:16,831
It looked that way to me, too!

410
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:17,832
Wait!

411
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:28,032
Next Conan, "Trick Versus Magic (Part 1)"

412
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:46,031
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:46,032 --> 00:24:48,531
"Evil Message."

414
00:24:48,532 --> 00:24:49,831
What? Next week,

415
00:24:49,832 --> 00:24:52,632
the two detectives are going to do an hour show?
