1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,550
Officer Takagi went off

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,550
"Meet with parents" -without telling anyone where he was going.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,950
Do you know Officer Wataru Takagi, children?

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,150
Yes, we do. But why?

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,150
I couldn't have asked for better.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,150
He asked me to hand this over to his detective girlfriend.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,050
Could you do so for me?

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,450
He said that it's perishable,

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,550
so open it as soon as you can.

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,450
He also said that it will be no good

11
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,350
by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,450
We opened the package

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,250
and found a tablet computer inside it.

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,950
When we switched it on, the screen displayed...

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,350
Officer Takagi?

16
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,550
While continuing investigations

17
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,050
to identify the location where Officer Takagi is,

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,750
three people who are likely connected emerged.

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,850
The person thought to be the culprit was identified,

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,350
and the police headed over to where he might be hiding.

21
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,250
Finally.

22
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,650
You've finally found me.

23
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,950
While waiting for you, I was about to doze off

24
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,250
and accidentally push the switch of the bomb.

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,550
Okay, now talk.

26
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,250
Tell us where Officer Takagi is.

27
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,650
I see.

28
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,750
Just like he said, you're quite a beauty.

29
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,450
But it doesn't mean he's right for dumping Natalie...

30
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,250
Now, listen well before I knock you over!

31
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,850
The man you kidnapped is Wataru Takagi,

32
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,250
and Natalie's boyfriend was Wataru Date!

33
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,650
Besides, she wasn't dumped!

34
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,350
But in a mail that she sent out, she said

35
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,050
that Wataru wouldn't come anymore!

36
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,750
Of course, he wouldn't!

37
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,650
It was because he was run over by a car

38
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,050
and passed away that day!

39
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,250
That... That can't be!

40
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,750
So, hurry up and tell us where Officer Takagi is.

41
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,750
Don't tell me...

42
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,850
Don't tell me that there was poison in the wine?

43
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,050
Hang on!

44
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,550
He is...

45
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,350
Where? Where is he?

46
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,750
-Hurry up and tell me! -He...

47
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,850
Where is he?

48
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,550
In the meantime, Officer Takagi finally succeeded

49
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,850
in cutting the rope tied onto his feet,

50
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,350
and dropped the sheet that was near his feet

51
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,650
and finds...

52
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,250
That's...

53
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,950
Wait a second! What's that?

54
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,150
-A bomb? -What?

55
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,050
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

56
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,950
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

57
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,550
Officer Takagi's in a pinch!

58
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,550
His energy is running out, and so is time limit for the bomb!

59
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,250
He sees through the one and only truth.

60
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,150
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

61
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,950
His name is Detective Conan!

62
00:04:32,157 --> 00:04:37,357
"A Life Risking Love Broadcast (Raid)"

63
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:44,057
Something that looks like a timer is in view.

64
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:46,157
A time bomb?

65
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:48,457
Hey, Shiratori.

66
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:51,957
Do you know the time when Ms. Natalie committed suicide?

67
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:54,257
If I remember correctly, the estimated time of death

68
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:56,257
was around 10.00 am.

69
00:04:56,257 --> 00:05:00,657
Hey, tomorrow will be the same day she died a year ago.

70
00:05:00,657 --> 00:05:05,057
If the timer is set to explode at that time...

71
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:08,857
So no matter what we do, Takagi will be blown up

72
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:11,257
in less than 18 hours from now?

73
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:14,157
-Oh, no... -Hey, wait!

74
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:17,357
The masking tape securing the bomb is about to peel off,

75
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:18,657
and it looks like it's about to fall off any minute now!

76
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:25,657
Darn it.

77
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:27,357
Officer Takagi!

78
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:28,557
Don't worry.

79
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:29,857
Officer Takagi has realized it,

80
00:05:29,857 --> 00:05:31,457
and he's trying to drop it with his feet.

81
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,657
-Go for it, Takagi! -Just a bit more!

82
00:05:33,657 --> 00:05:35,357
Drop it!

83
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:42,057
He put it on the board.

84
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:44,057
What are you doing, Takagi?

85
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:46,357
-Somebody's there. -Huh?

86
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:48,757
Officer Takagi heard somebody's voice from below,

87
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:50,957
so he didn't drop it.

88
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:53,957
The audio from the tablet has been disabled, hasn't it?

89
00:05:53,957 --> 00:05:57,757
In spite of that, Officer Takagi's mouth is sealed with masking tape.

90
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,357
This means that he's in a place

91
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:02,657
where his voice could be heard by passersby.

92
00:06:02,657 --> 00:06:09,057
So, Officer Takagi did what he did to protect the people there.

93
00:06:09,057 --> 00:06:10,757
Takagi...

94
00:06:10,757 --> 00:06:13,457
I wonder who will be number one tomorrow?

95
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,857
Of course, it's dad!

96
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:18,557
Because he's the strongest!

97
00:06:20,957 --> 00:06:23,557
The strongest...

98
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:26,357
Officer Date, you are definitely strong to be able

99
00:06:26,357 --> 00:06:30,057
to take such a huge suspect into custody just like that.

100
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,457
I heard that you were the top in the police school too, right?

101
00:06:33,457 --> 00:06:36,957
Oh, come on. That rumor is rubbish.

102
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:39,057
I always placed second.

103
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:40,657
I could never outdo him,

104
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:44,157
be it physically or mentally.

105
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:45,257
"Him"?

106
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:48,457
He was a kind and lanky guy like you.

107
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:51,457
I wonder where he is and what he's doing now.

108
00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:53,857
Maybe he's dropped dead somewhere

109
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:57,657
because he was overconfident about himself.

110
00:06:57,657 --> 00:06:59,557
You'd better be careful, too.

111
00:06:59,557 --> 00:07:02,857
Although we're officers, we've only got one life.

112
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:06,257
Don't risk your life on something unworthy.

113
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:09,357
Officer Date.

114
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,757
We should narrow down the place

115
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:17,657
where Officer Takagi is to Hokkaido?

116
00:07:17,657 --> 00:07:19,557
Why is that, Conan?

117
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:22,257
Because the crow in the image with Officer Takagi

118
00:07:22,257 --> 00:07:24,757
is probably a Western jackdaw.

119
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:28,557
Western jackdaws are usually found in Europe,

120
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:31,657
but they were found twice in Japan in the past.

121
00:07:31,657 --> 00:07:34,857
And both times, they were found in Hokkaido!

122
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:38,657
But that's not enough to conclude that his location is in Hokkaido.

123
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:40,057
-Hey. -What?

124
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:41,457
What is that light?

125
00:07:41,457 --> 00:07:43,657
I wonder, too.

126
00:07:43,657 --> 00:07:45,057
What is it?

127
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:46,457
Over here.

128
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:48,357
There is a thin pillar of light

129
00:07:48,357 --> 00:07:51,157
in the sky behind Officer Takagi.

130
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:53,257
The sun pillar phenomenon.

131
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:55,057
At dawn and sundown,

132
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:59,657
if sunlight is reflected in the diamond dust in the air,

133
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:02,657
it will look like a shining pillar.

134
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:05,857
It is written on the internet that it is only seen

135
00:08:05,857 --> 00:08:07,357
in cold places like Hokkaido.

136
00:08:07,357 --> 00:08:11,157
Hey, do you mean Takagi is in such a cold place?

137
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,657
We've got to rescue him quickly, then!

138
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:15,757
He'll freeze to death!

139
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:19,257
Hey. Do you know what temperature

140
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:20,457
causes the diamond dust to form?

141
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:22,157
If I remember correctly,

142
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:24,457
it's 20 degrees Celcius below the freezing point.

143
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:26,957
Minus 20 degrees Celcius?

144
00:08:26,957 --> 00:08:29,057
It looks to be a quite a distance away,

145
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:30,957
so there's no guarantee that Officer Takagi

146
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:32,557
is right where it happened.

147
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:35,357
It's certain that he's somewhere nearby though.

148
00:08:35,357 --> 00:08:37,857
Superintendent...

149
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:40,957
It's Hokkaido!

150
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:45,457
I've confirmed that Hokkaido is where Takagi is being confined!

151
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:48,357
Ask for help from the Hokkaido police

152
00:08:48,357 --> 00:08:50,257
and contact all the construction companies

153
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:52,857
as well as the demolishers!

154
00:08:52,857 --> 00:08:55,057
Ask them to re-investigate!

155
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:56,457
Yes, sir...

156
00:08:56,457 --> 00:08:57,757
Let's go.

157
00:08:57,757 --> 00:09:01,557
Megure! You shall fly to Hokkaido with Sato!

158
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:04,557
Judging from the word "friend" that was written in the mail,

159
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:07,757
an accomplice of the suspect may be at the site.

160
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:09,657
Don't forget to bring your gun and cell phone!

161
00:09:09,657 --> 00:09:10,957
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

162
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:14,157
Hold on, Takagi.

163
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:16,757
Just hang on a little while more.

164
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,157
Thank you.

165
00:09:40,657 --> 00:09:42,357
But something's strange.

166
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:44,657
They said they were checking all buildings

167
00:09:44,657 --> 00:09:46,657
that have over four stories in Hokkaido,

168
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:49,157
so why haven't they found it yet?

169
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:50,957
If the culprit had a lot of friends,

170
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,557
and they set the place up on their own,

171
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:54,357
then it would be a different story.

172
00:09:54,357 --> 00:09:56,057
If they asked a construction company to do it,

173
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:57,357
a building with four or more stories

174
00:09:57,357 --> 00:10:00,157
shouldn't be that difficult to find.

175
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:03,257
Besides, it also bothers me

176
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:05,557
that Officer Takagi dropped the sheet below.

177
00:10:06,457 --> 00:10:08,057
It's true that someone who passed by the site

178
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:11,757
could've heard the sound of the sheet that fell.

179
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:14,557
But if the police memo book that he dropped the night before

180
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:17,457
is covered by the sheet, everything would go to waste.

181
00:10:18,257 --> 00:10:20,357
Maybe...

182
00:10:20,357 --> 00:10:22,857
he had another reason for doing so.

183
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,657
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

184
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:28,657
You were recording Officer Takagi's image

185
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:30,857
with your cell phone, weren't you?

186
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:33,157
Yes, I did.

187
00:10:33,157 --> 00:10:34,857
Show it to me!

188
00:10:37,157 --> 00:10:40,757
Don't tell me that the place where Officer Takagi is being confined...

189
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:44,457
Don't tell me that...

190
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:51,254
Hey, Megure. Haven't you found Takagi yet?

191
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:52,454
No, sir.

192
00:10:52,454 --> 00:10:55,954
The prefectural headquarter choppers are helping us search for him, too.

193
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:58,254
But we've got to narrow down the location a bit more,

194
00:10:58,254 --> 00:10:59,554
or it'll be difficult...

195
00:10:59,554 --> 00:11:02,354
Have you received any report on your side?

196
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:03,654
No.

197
00:11:03,654 --> 00:11:06,654
We had them re-investigate after dawn,

198
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:10,854
but no four-storey building as the one seen on the tablet

199
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:13,254
where Takagi could be has been found yet.

200
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:15,754
Is... Is Takagi all right?

201
00:11:15,754 --> 00:11:16,954
Yeah.

202
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:19,954
It looks as if he's about to die any minute though.

203
00:11:19,954 --> 00:11:25,054
Maybe we should consider places other than Hokkaido at this point.

204
00:11:25,054 --> 00:11:26,654
What is it? What happened?

205
00:11:26,654 --> 00:11:29,554
Snow... It just started to snow!

206
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:32,054
Superintendent! How is it over there?

207
00:11:32,054 --> 00:11:33,754
Is there any snow on Officer Takagi's image?

208
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:36,154
There's snow here, too!

209
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,654
Confirm with the meteorological agency! Hurry!

210
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:39,854
Yes, sir!

211
00:11:39,854 --> 00:11:41,554
Superintendent!

212
00:11:41,554 --> 00:11:43,654
We've only got less than an hour

213
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:45,554
until the expected time of explosion of the place of confinement!

214
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:47,554
I know that!

215
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:50,454
Superintendent! It's only snowing in Hokkaido!

216
00:11:50,454 --> 00:11:54,154
They said it started to snow in most areas in Hokkaido.

217
00:11:54,154 --> 00:11:57,554
So, Takagi's being confined somewhere in Hokkaido after all.

218
00:11:57,554 --> 00:11:59,054
But how?

219
00:11:59,054 --> 00:12:01,154
We already checked all buildings which are four stories or taller

220
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,354
in the entire prefecture, and yet...

221
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:04,754
why can't we find him?

222
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:06,954
That's because it's less than four stories tall.

223
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:08,054
What?

224
00:12:08,054 --> 00:12:10,354
The culprit used a trick

225
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,454
to make the site of confinement appear to be more than four stories tall.

226
00:12:13,454 --> 00:12:16,254
I came here because Conan said that he realized something

227
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:19,054
after looking at the image of Takagi yesterday.

228
00:12:20,754 --> 00:12:24,454
I stayed up all night analyzing that image,

229
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:27,354
and finally found the evidence.

230
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:30,454
But we also watched that image

231
00:12:30,454 --> 00:12:32,254
until there was nothing else to check,

232
00:12:32,254 --> 00:12:33,354
and couldn't find anything.

233
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:36,454
I wonder if the shaky image was checked?

234
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:37,854
The image that was shaking?

235
00:12:37,854 --> 00:12:40,254
The one where the crow perched on the stick

236
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:42,354
or whatever the camera was attached to.

237
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:44,154
This is the image.

238
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:46,854
Since the camera swayed and moved a bit out of place,

239
00:12:46,854 --> 00:12:48,554
we fast forwarded it and checked.

240
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:51,854
See. Take a good look at this image.

241
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,854
Near Officer Takagi's left shoulder.

242
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:56,754
Something's here, right?

243
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:58,654
Something that looks like a hook.

244
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:02,154
That... That's true.

245
00:13:02,154 --> 00:13:03,754
But what on earth is it?

246
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:07,554
A hook that is on the tip of the string of the police memo book.

247
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:11,154
So, this is the police memo book that Takagi dropped.

248
00:13:11,154 --> 00:13:13,654
But isn't it in a weird position?

249
00:13:13,654 --> 00:13:17,054
Yeah. It looks as if it's floating in the air or something.

250
00:13:17,054 --> 00:13:20,654
It's not afloat. It's sitting on something.

251
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:23,354
It's on a mirror.

252
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:25,954
A mirror?

253
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:29,854
That's why Officer Takagi dropped the police memo book.

254
00:13:29,854 --> 00:13:32,554
He wanted us to see through this mirror trick.

255
00:13:32,554 --> 00:13:36,654
Unfortunately, it got hidden under the board.

256
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:39,754
He dropped the sheet that was covering the board

257
00:13:39,754 --> 00:13:41,654
for the same reason.

258
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,754
In other words,

259
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:46,054
the bottom part of the front view of the image was a mirrored image.

260
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:49,154
Which means the place is only about two stories high.

261
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:52,254
Yeah. The fact that Officer Takagi is still alive

262
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:53,754
proves that, too.

263
00:13:53,754 --> 00:13:56,154
The fact that he's alive is the proof?

264
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:57,554
Don't you get it?

265
00:13:57,554 --> 00:13:58,954
The sun pillar phenomenon only occurs

266
00:13:58,954 --> 00:14:02,054
at a temperature of 20 degrees Celcius below freezing point.

267
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:04,654
If a person wearing only a suit top is left in a place

268
00:14:04,654 --> 00:14:07,954
where such a phenomenon can be seen,

269
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:10,954
it won't take him even a day to freeze to death.

270
00:14:10,954 --> 00:14:14,154
Then, why is Officer Takagi still...

271
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:17,354
An electrically heated wire is placed behind the mirror.

272
00:14:17,354 --> 00:14:21,254
It's to melt the snow so that it doesn't accumulate.

273
00:14:21,254 --> 00:14:22,854
Right, Doc?

274
00:14:22,854 --> 00:14:24,054
Yeah.

275
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:25,254
If the snow accumulates,

276
00:14:25,254 --> 00:14:27,854
it'll give away the fact that there's a mirror.

277
00:14:27,854 --> 00:14:30,554
Well, thanks to the heat, the temperature rose slightly,

278
00:14:30,554 --> 00:14:33,754
and it was a blessing for Officer Takagi.

279
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:35,054
Okay!

280
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:38,354
Change the investigation area to two-storey buildings!

281
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:39,454
If it's two stories,

282
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:41,954
it's highly probable that it could be a house, too!

283
00:14:41,954 --> 00:14:44,554
Notify the Prefectural police headquarters

284
00:14:44,554 --> 00:14:46,554
to check on renovators, too!

285
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:47,654
Yes, sir...

286
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:51,554
Megure, the site is probably a house where the roof's been blown off!

287
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:53,754
It'll be easier to find from the sky!

288
00:14:53,754 --> 00:14:56,354
There's probably only 40 minutes left before the explosion.

289
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,854
Find Takagi at all costs before that!

290
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:01,554
Copy, sir!

291
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:05,154
Where... Where are you, Officer Takagi?

292
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:11,454
Superintendent!

293
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:14,454
Officer Takagi is sticking the edge of the masking tape on his mouth

294
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:16,554
onto the steel pole beside him.

295
00:15:16,554 --> 00:15:18,454
Did he peel it off?

296
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:22,654
-Well done. -He can call for help now!

297
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:28,754
Hey, what's the matter, Takagi?

298
00:15:28,754 --> 00:15:30,454
Why isn't he calling out?

299
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:33,154
He probably can't call out.

300
00:15:33,154 --> 00:15:35,954
He's so weak that he has lost his voice.

301
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:38,254
He hasn't had anything to drink for more than two days,

302
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:40,154
so his throat is probably parched.

303
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:41,954
Oh, no.

304
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:44,454
Takagi.

305
00:15:44,454 --> 00:15:46,654
Wait a second!

306
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,954
Aren't those kites flying behind Officer Takagi?

307
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:53,954
But it's not only one or two!

308
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,954
It... It's a kite-flying contest!

309
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:58,254
Shiratori, can you identify the place?

310
00:15:58,254 --> 00:15:59,454
Yes, sir.

311
00:16:00,854 --> 00:16:05,054
Kite-flying contests are being held at three places today in Hokkaido.

312
00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:09,654
Ikeguchi Town, Komamae Town and Hibai City.

313
00:16:09,654 --> 00:16:12,454
Inform the Hokkaido Police HQ of this immediately!

314
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:14,054
Yes, sir!

315
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:16,754
But isn't there any way we can narrow it down to one place?

316
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:18,554
There's only less than five minutes until the bomb explodes!

317
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:20,154
Superintendent!

318
00:16:20,154 --> 00:16:21,954
He's... His mouth...

319
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:23,654
Officer Takagi is moving his mouth

320
00:16:23,654 --> 00:16:25,454
and trying to say something.

321
00:16:25,454 --> 00:16:29,054
-What? -But the image isn't straight on.

322
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,854
And with snow blocking the view,

323
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:33,254
it's hard to read his lips.

324
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:38,754
It's Komamae.

325
00:16:38,754 --> 00:16:41,354
The only three consonants you can't pronounce unless you close your lips

326
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:43,754
are "m", "b", and "p"!

327
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,654
If he was trying to tell us where he is,

328
00:16:45,654 --> 00:16:46,654
it would have to be the three places mentioned earlier.

329
00:16:46,654 --> 00:16:47,954
And the only place he would need to close his lips twice to pronounce

330
00:16:47,954 --> 00:16:49,254
would be "Komamae"!

331
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:51,454
Megure! Go to Komamae Town!

332
00:16:51,454 --> 00:16:54,754
Go there on the double! Takagi's there!

333
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:59,254
We're flying right over Komamae Town now!

334
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,054
There he is!

335
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:05,054
To the right of the chopper! Right below!

336
00:17:05,054 --> 00:17:07,054
Officer Takagi...

337
00:17:07,054 --> 00:17:08,454
We've found Takagi!

338
00:17:08,454 --> 00:17:11,154
He's in the vicinity of Komamae 3rd Street!

339
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:12,754
There doesn't seem to be any accomplices!

340
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:15,354
Hurry! There's only less than two minutes left!

341
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:22,054
Not good! If we go any closer,

342
00:17:22,054 --> 00:17:24,654
Takagi's body will fall from the impact of the wind!

343
00:17:29,154 --> 00:17:30,854
Inspector! Please use the loudspeaker

344
00:17:30,854 --> 00:17:33,254
and ask the passersby and town people to evacuate!

345
00:17:33,254 --> 00:17:35,254
Hey, Sato?

346
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,154
Sato! Just what are you...

347
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:38,554
Sato!

348
00:17:40,354 --> 00:17:42,154
Officer Sato...

349
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:51,554
I felt like Officer Sato came flying down from the sky just now

350
00:17:51,554 --> 00:17:53,654
with her panty and everything showing.

351
00:17:56,154 --> 00:18:00,554
I think I'm done for. I don't think I'll make it.

352
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:02,754
Takagi!

353
00:18:04,454 --> 00:18:07,254
Move your head to the left, then stay still!

354
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,154
Sato!

355
00:18:27,154 --> 00:18:29,354
Takagi!

356
00:18:36,154 --> 00:18:37,754
Are you alive, Wataru?

357
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:40,554
Oh, yes... Somehow...

358
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,654
I'm so glad!

359
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,954
We'd better get out of here quickly!

360
00:18:48,654 --> 00:18:51,054
What... What happened to Takagi?

361
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:52,654
The image went static.

362
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:55,554
-Don't die! -Takagi!

363
00:19:02,554 --> 00:19:05,754
Off... Officer Sato! We're on duty, you know?

364
00:19:05,754 --> 00:19:09,554
Who cares? Nobody's watching anyway.

365
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:15,154
He seems okay.

366
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,354
Takagi...

367
00:19:17,354 --> 00:19:20,754
You should've just died.

368
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:24,754
According to the information we just got from the Hokkaido Police HQ,

369
00:19:24,754 --> 00:19:27,654
the suspect, Fuemoto was suffering from terminal cancer,

370
00:19:27,654 --> 00:19:29,254
and the house where he confined Takagi in

371
00:19:29,254 --> 00:19:31,554
was bought under a fake company name.

372
00:19:31,554 --> 00:19:33,054
It seems that he placed an order with the renovators

373
00:19:33,054 --> 00:19:37,054
saying that he wanted to put a skylight above the entrance,

374
00:19:37,054 --> 00:19:39,954
but he asked them to stop the construction

375
00:19:39,954 --> 00:19:41,554
for three days.

376
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:45,454
Nobody's listening.

377
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:48,854
Shiratori, I'll leave the rest to you.

378
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,554
-Yes, sir. -Megure.

379
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:51,954
The two of them are fine.

380
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:55,454
You go on and join the Hokkaido Police HQ right away.

381
00:19:58,354 --> 00:20:00,254
It ran out of battery.

382
00:21:32,254 --> 00:21:36,654
We're a month late to visit Officer Date's grave.

383
00:21:36,654 --> 00:21:38,554
Well, Officer Takagi...

384
00:21:38,554 --> 00:21:41,354
You had to go through a lot, like frostbite and such.

385
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:42,954
It can't be helped.

386
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:45,254
If only I had relayed to her

387
00:21:45,254 --> 00:21:48,754
that Officer Date had died of a traffic accident that day,

388
00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:50,054
this wouldn't have happened.

389
00:21:50,054 --> 00:21:51,454
Don't be silly.

390
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:53,254
Ms. Natalie knew about it.

391
00:21:53,254 --> 00:21:56,154
She knew that Officer Date had passed away.

392
00:21:56,154 --> 00:21:59,854
Officer Date's parents remembered her.

393
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:02,854
When they went to the hospital to confirm his body,

394
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,354
they saw a Japanese-American girl

395
00:22:04,354 --> 00:22:08,554
standing outside the room with tears in her eyes.

396
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:13,154
It seems that Officer Date had planned to see

397
00:22:13,154 --> 00:22:16,054
and talk to her parents that night.

398
00:22:16,054 --> 00:22:18,554
It also seems he wanted to bring his parents along

399
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:21,354
and introduce her to them.

400
00:22:21,354 --> 00:22:22,854
Is that so?

401
00:22:22,854 --> 00:22:26,254
That's why it wasn't your fault, Officer Takagi.

402
00:22:28,254 --> 00:22:30,654
"Date"

403
00:22:31,854 --> 00:22:34,054
But...

404
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:38,854
I wanted to give her this after all.

405
00:22:38,854 --> 00:22:40,954
This ring.

406
00:22:40,954 --> 00:22:43,954
Because the last words of Officer Date

407
00:22:43,954 --> 00:22:46,454
probably meant this.

408
00:22:48,154 --> 00:22:50,254
I'm leaving this...

409
00:22:51,354 --> 00:22:53,954
to you...

410
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:08,154
A toothpick.

411
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:12,354
Why is it in a place like this?

412
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:14,054
Come to think of it, Officer Date

413
00:23:14,054 --> 00:23:16,554
used to always hold a toothpick in his mouth.

414
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:17,654
Yes.

415
00:23:17,654 --> 00:23:20,654
Somebody who came to pay a visit here before us

416
00:23:20,654 --> 00:23:22,754
probably left it here as an offering.

417
00:23:22,754 --> 00:23:25,154
I wonder who it was though.

418
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,254
"What have you been up to? Call me every now and again! Date."

419
00:23:31,854 --> 00:23:35,054
"Delete, Cancel"

420
00:23:35,054 --> 00:23:37,354
May you rest in peace...

421
00:23:39,454 --> 00:23:40,954
my friend.

422
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:55,954
I always make it a point to tell myself.

423
00:23:55,954 --> 00:23:58,854
Don't worry. You haven't fallen. You haven't fallen.

424
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,454
He fell!

425
00:24:00,454 --> 00:24:01,854
Let's go to the site.

426
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:04,154
Come on, hurry.

427
00:24:04,154 --> 00:24:05,254
Yes.

428
00:24:05,254 --> 00:24:07,754
I'm the one who took the picture.

429
00:24:07,754 --> 00:24:09,954
I'm the one who wrote the article.

430
00:24:09,954 --> 00:24:13,454
And I'm supposedly the one who edited it

431
00:24:13,454 --> 00:24:15,754
and put it in the Weekly Magazine Great.

432
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,454
Supposedly?

433
00:24:17,454 --> 00:24:22,954
