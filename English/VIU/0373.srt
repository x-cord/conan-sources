1
00:00:20,586 --> 00:00:22,585
Today's case is about poisonous spiders!

2
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:24,385
Vertical strings and horizontal strings. The locked room trick.

3
00:00:24,386 --> 00:00:26,185
Open a hole in the tangled mystery!

4
00:00:26,186 --> 00:00:27,685
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,686 --> 00:00:29,485
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,486 --> 00:00:31,386
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:59,000
Come on, Mitsuhiko, Ayumi!

8
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:01,600
Hurry up!

9
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:04,100
Let's play soccer.

10
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:06,700
Let's do so after we go to the library.

11
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:09,300
New books have come in yesterday.

12
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:13,100
Shoots, I came because you said we were going to play soccer.

13
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:15,600
Hey, say something, Conan.

14
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:18,800
I kind of feel like reading too.

15
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:22,200
What? You're the one who said you wanted to play soccer.

16
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:24,201
You traitor!

17
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:31,301
Really, talk about childish.

18
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,601
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

19
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:02,601
You're going, aren't you, detective?

20
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:11,301
"Deadly Venom Spider Trap."

21
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,600
Why don't you try calling the professor?

22
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,500
My hands are full right now.

23
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:27,500
Why don't you call?

24
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:29,100
I will then.

25
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:31,801
Oh, it's okay, I'll call.

26
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:41,101
It's the signal of lunch break for a nearby factory.

27
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:44,900
He's not answering.

28
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:46,700
Will you call him later?

29
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:48,101
Okay.

30
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,601
A red-back spider.

31
00:03:57,801 --> 00:04:00,200
-What? -Look out!

32
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:01,900
Genta, don't push me.

33
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,101
We're not going to...

34
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,000
Just what are you doing?

35
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:11,900
It's because you guys left on your own.

36
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:14,500
It's no fair.

37
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:16,800
Ayumi too?

38
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:19,500
Hey! Just what are you guys doing?

39
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:21,600
What? Mitsuhiko?

40
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:22,700
What?

41
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:24,100
Do you know him?

42
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:29,700
Yes, he's Mr. Itogawa who lives next door to me.

43
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:31,600
"Tooru Itogawa (32)" -He's a professor who's researching spiders

44
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,301
at the university.

45
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:40,300
That's a red-back spider, isn't it?

46
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,300
"Yoshiki Urazaki (38)" -Yeah, that's right.

47
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:44,400
It's amazing that you know, kid.

48
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:47,200
Some years ago, it was discovered in Japan

49
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,901
and was big news.

50
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,600
You see how its back is red?

51
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:56,600
That's why it's called the "Seakagoke" spider.

52
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:59,000
It's also called the red-back spider.

53
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:00,300
It's a poisonous spider

54
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,300
that lives mainly in Australia and Central America.

55
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:05,900
You mean a venomous spider is in Beika-cho?

56
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:10,000
"Miwa Yasuda (28)" -No, we're borrowing this yard to take pictures.

57
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:12,100
I'm a reporter.

58
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:14,200
We're making this magazine.

59
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:17,400
We're doing a venomous spider special in our next week edition.

60
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,501
See.

61
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,900
Then, that spider is...

62
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:24,700
He's my pet.

63
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,600
Pet?

64
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:29,200
Although I may not look it,

65
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:30,800
I'm quite well-known as a "venomous spider freak".

66
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:33,301
I have a variety of venomous spider pets.

67
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:41,000
We're leaving to interview the professor,

68
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,500
so call him, will you?

69
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:43,701
Yes, ma'am...

70
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:51,701
Hello, Professor, this is Urazaki.

71
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:56,100
What's the matter, professor?

72
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:59,200
It bit me! The black widow spider bit me!

73
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:00,600
What?

74
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:03,700
Please inject yourself with the serum! Professor!

75
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:06,201
The serum...

76
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,601
"Beika Agriculture University West Entrance."

77
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:14,401
"Shinno Laboratory."

78
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:17,601
Darn it! It won't open!

79
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:20,001
Here's the spare key.

80
00:06:26,201 --> 00:06:27,301
Professor!

81
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:30,700
All of you stay here.

82
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:32,101
Okay.

83
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:40,600
Oh, no. He's dead.

84
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,400
The professor passed away.

85
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:45,500
Why?

86
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:48,700
Look, there is no sign that he injected the serum.

87
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,301
No way.

88
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:52,900
Mr. Urazaki,

89
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:54,601
hurry call the police.

90
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:03,500
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing, Miwa?

91
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:05,200
Look!

92
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:09,000
It's a venomous spider, the one that bit the professor.

93
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:10,401
I'm telling you, stop it!

94
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:19,301
It's already dead.

95
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:22,400
That spider has nerve venom

96
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:25,700
that is several times stronger than that of the red-back spider.

97
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:29,800
But not strong enough for a human to die instantly.

98
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:31,800
Don't touch it!

99
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:34,901
We have to leave it that way until the police get here.

100
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:38,600
Hey.

101
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:40,001
Let me borrow it a while.

102
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,700
Hello, is this the police?

103
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:51,901
Yes...

104
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:56,901
Which means he was bitten here?

105
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:04,400
It's gone.

106
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,100
The serum for the Black Widow Spider is gone.

107
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:08,400
What?

108
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:11,101
It's always left over here and yet...

109
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:15,000
Hey, take a look.

110
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:18,200
It seems to have escaped from here.

111
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:22,300
He never ever forgot to close the lid before.

112
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,500
We're only human, so there are times we forget.

113
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:26,901
This is...

114
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:43,300
Understand? Don't come in during investigation.

115
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:45,200
What's with him?

116
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:48,000
We're witnesses to the case too.

117
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:50,501
If you chase us away, the case won't be solved.

118
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:57,000
The ones who have the key to this room are Professor Shinno

119
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:59,400
and Mr. Itogawa, his assistant?

120
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:01,100
Yes, sir.

121
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:04,201
Mr. Urazaki, you were acquainted with the professor.

122
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:08,000
Were the door and windows always locked?

123
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:12,601
Yes, sir. It's because a variety of venomous spiders are being bred.

124
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:15,500
To think that he forgot to

125
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:17,701
close the lid of the breeding box of venomous spiders...

126
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:24,001
Are you bothered?

127
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:30,801
Oh, then go ahead and think like that forever.

128
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:34,801
I saw something.

129
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:37,800
What did you see?

130
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:40,600
There's a scratch on the professor's ear

131
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:43,300
as if he brought the receiver to his ear without realizing that

132
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:44,901
the spider was there and was bitten.

133
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,700
But it seems to be rare that

134
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:52,401
someone who is bitten by this spider dies on the spot.

135
00:09:54,601 --> 00:10:00,000
Conan, I just told you not to come inside!

136
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:02,500
Oh, just for a while.

137
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:05,601
Isn't this medicine for the heart?

138
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:13,800
Did the professor have a heart problem?

139
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:14,801
Yes.

140
00:10:14,802 --> 00:10:17,400
Really? I didn't know.

141
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:20,900
If so, it was an accident after all?

142
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:24,200
You're the one who called the professor, Mr. Urazaki?

143
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:27,200
Yeah, but Miwa called him before I did.

144
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:30,000
Nobody answered the phone at that time, right?

145
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:31,501
Right.

146
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,701
Conan! Be careful with that.

147
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:46,000
That's right, I have to call Pops.

148
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:48,601
"Urazaki Cell Phone" -Mr. Urazaki's call is here.

149
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:54,401
If you need to make a call, I'll lend you my cell phone.

150
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:59,600
It's okay. I already got through.

151
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:02,501
Hello, Pops?

152
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:10,501
It's the same model as the one back then.

153
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:17,101
So, I'm going to be a little late. Why?

154
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:33,101
This is not an accident!

155
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:44,633
What's the matter, Mr. Itogawa?

156
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:47,333
I have to attend a academic conference tomorrow.

157
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:51,233
I'm going to have to deliver the speech in place of the professor.

158
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:55,634
What? How can you talk about a conference at a time like this?

159
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:00,933
But, it's an important academic conference that was scheduled long before.

160
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:03,233
So if I have the documents, I can deliver the speech.

161
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:05,033
The truth is...

162
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:07,633
it's your research isn't it, Mr. Itogawa?

163
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:10,834
What? Is that true?

164
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:15,133
The professor was delivering speeches

165
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,233
on the results of Mr. Itogawa's research all this time

166
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:20,133
as if it were his own.

167
00:12:20,134 --> 00:12:24,133
So he snatched away the works of his assistant.

168
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:26,133
It's the usual stuff that goes around.

169
00:12:26,134 --> 00:12:31,133
Which means that you had a grudge against the professor, Mr. Itogawa!

170
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:32,733
Speak for yourself, Mr. Urazaki.

171
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:34,133
What? Why you...

172
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:37,033
Come on, Mr. Urazaki.

173
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:40,933
So, do you have something against him too?

174
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:43,933
No, I don't.

175
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:47,333
If you've got something, will you show it to us?

176
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:48,733
No, it's nothing.

177
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,533
It's nothing, I tell you!

178
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:53,133
Then, please show it to us, Mr. Urazaki.

179
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:54,234
Darn!

180
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,133
Those are all rare spiders

181
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:01,233
that aren't found in Japan.

182
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:03,834
Just what does this mean?

183
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,433
Mr. Urazaki was buying the spiders from the professor.

184
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:09,434
Spiders?

185
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:10,434
Yes.

186
00:13:11,434 --> 00:13:14,033
Saying that it would be used for research,

187
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:16,333
the professor was able to get a hold of rare and valuable spiders

188
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:18,033
from all over the world.

189
00:13:18,034 --> 00:13:20,233
And he's sly too.

190
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:24,234
He picks on our weaknesses and raises the price.

191
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:29,533
Moreover, you had a grudge against the professor.

192
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:32,033
Absurd, this is an accident.

193
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:36,033
He was punished for playing around with my passion for spiders.

194
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:39,633
Pops says he's figured out who the killer is!

195
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:42,333
Conan? You're still here!

196
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:44,433
He says that this is not an accident?

197
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:47,233
Right, he says that it's strange that

198
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:50,333
only the serum for the Black Widow Spider is missing.

199
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:52,133
It's true that everything fits in too well

200
00:13:52,134 --> 00:13:54,333
if it isn't an accident.

201
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,733
Mr. Itogawa, you're the only one who has the spare key.

202
00:13:58,734 --> 00:14:00,033
Yes.

203
00:14:00,034 --> 00:14:02,733
But, Mr. Itogawa, as well as Conan and the others

204
00:14:02,734 --> 00:14:05,834
heard the professor scream at the same time.

205
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:11,433
Pops says to check this telephone carefully.

206
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,833
-The telephone? -What?

207
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:16,033
There's something shiny over here.

208
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:17,134
What?

209
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:22,633
Something is definitely inside the hole

210
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:25,134
just where the ear is to be placed.

211
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,733
It's a needle.

212
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:32,234
So, this is what was inside!

213
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:36,434
The tip of the needle is broken off.

214
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:46,134
What's up, Conan?

215
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:48,934
The toilet!

216
00:14:52,734 --> 00:14:54,833
The tip of the needle is broken off

217
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:57,933
so you can't tell from the exterior of the telephone.

218
00:14:57,934 --> 00:15:02,333
Which means that the thing that poked the professor's ear is this needle.

219
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:06,534
Then, why did he shout, "I was bitten by a Black Widow Spider"?

220
00:15:09,234 --> 00:15:11,333
Yes.

221
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:12,634
Mr. Mouri!

222
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:16,333
I've heard about the circumstances from Conan.

223
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:19,333
The killer poked a Black Widow Spider on to the needle point

224
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:23,233
of the thumbtack that was rigged inside.

225
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:25,133
Take a very close look using the magnifying glass

226
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:27,833
at that dead spider over there.

227
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:31,034
-Wait. -Hey, Takagi.

228
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:38,133
I see!

229
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:43,533
Takagi, hurry and explain it to us too.

230
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:46,733
Hey, Mouri! Just what are you trying to get to?

231
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:49,934
In other words, Inspector! This is how it is...

232
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:04,533
The killer who rigged the needle into the telephone

233
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:09,033
pokes a spider that is killed beforehand onto the tip of the needle,

234
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,933
to make the professor mistakenly think

235
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:14,433
that he is bitten by a Black Widow Spider.

236
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:16,333
Then for the serum.

237
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:19,133
The killer steals the serum for the Black Widow Spider.

238
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:22,133
After all is done, the killer replaces the phone

239
00:16:22,134 --> 00:16:24,434
and just waits for the professor to pick up the phone.

240
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,534
So, that's the story.

241
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:31,534
Which means that the professor died because...

242
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:36,534
Hello, Professor Shinno, this is Urazaki.

243
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:42,434
It bit me! The black widow spider bit me!

244
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:47,334
Please inject yourself with the serum! Professor! The serum!

245
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,033
It's gone!

246
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:54,934
The serum is gone!

247
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:11,733
All right, Mr. Mouri, goodbye then.

248
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:17,133
Inspector, the professor did not die from the venom of the spider.

249
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:18,134
Which means?

250
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:20,233
Since he's a venomous spider researcher,

251
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:23,933
he is well aware of the danger of spider venom.

252
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:26,333
He had to inject himself immediately with the serum,

253
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:28,933
but he couldn't find it.

254
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:30,533
Since the professor had a weak heart,

255
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:33,133
if cornered into such a situation.

256
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:35,833
I see, if the person has a weak heart,

257
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:38,433
the sudden stress make induce an attack.

258
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:40,133
Yes, sir.

259
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:41,633
Which means that the killer is someone

260
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:43,933
who can go in and out at will from the research lab,

261
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:47,434
as well as know about the professor's weak heart.

262
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,934
Just what proof do you have to say something like that?

263
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:54,834
Mr. Mouri said,

264
00:17:54,835 --> 00:17:58,433
"look at the incoming calls record of the telephone".

265
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:01,633
"Urazaki Cell Phone" -12:50 pm, Urazaki cell phone.

266
00:18:01,634 --> 00:18:04,634
I made the call and the professor answered.

267
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:09,833
"University Clerk Office" -5:30 pm, university clerk office.

268
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:11,533
This is yesterday's record,

269
00:18:11,534 --> 00:18:13,333
it has nothing to do with today.

270
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:14,633
Strange,

271
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:18,633
Yasuda should've called the professor once before I gave him a call.

272
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:20,133
The time was 12:00 pm

273
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:23,633
because the lunch break time tone of the factory.

274
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:27,934
Oh, I seemed to have called the wrong number back then.

275
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:31,634
Will you please show me your cell phone?

276
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:39,533
She's definitely called a different number.

277
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:43,733
Huh? That cell phone's the same as Mr. Itokawa's.

278
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:47,033
What? Oh, it's just a coincidence.

279
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:51,833
Pops said that Mr. Itokawa is protecting you.

280
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:53,733
He said that you're going out with each other.

281
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:54,734
What?

282
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:56,433
Although it's already an old model,

283
00:18:56,434 --> 00:18:59,033
it's unusual that you both still use the same type

284
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:01,233
but of a different color.

285
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:03,133
I see.

286
00:19:03,134 --> 00:19:05,133
If you two are going with each other,

287
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:07,233
Ms. Yasuda would have the opportunity

288
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:09,533
to make a spare key from the key that Mr. Itokawa has.

289
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:12,433
Besides that, she's knowledgeable about spiders

290
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:14,433
thanks to Mr. Itogawa telling her about them.

291
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:17,233
It's not all that strange that she could've known

292
00:19:17,234 --> 00:19:19,333
that the professor had a weak heart.

293
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:23,633
Wait, it's true that we're going with each other.

294
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:26,833
But, that isn't reason enough to be suspicious of her.

295
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,033
We've got proof.

296
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:33,233
The seal with the blue flower on it, that's in your pocket.

297
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:38,733
We saw you secretly pick it up from the floor, Mr. Itogawa.

298
00:19:38,734 --> 00:19:40,734
Will you please give it to me?

299
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:51,133
That's the nail art seal that you're using, isn't it?

300
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:53,233
No, it's not.

301
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,433
See?

302
00:19:55,434 --> 00:19:59,734
Can you show me the magazine you showed me a while ago?

303
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:02,234
Yes.

304
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:09,633
It's here.

305
00:20:09,634 --> 00:20:10,634
See.

306
00:20:13,234 --> 00:20:14,733
It's real!

307
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:17,334
Didn't you drop it today in this room?

308
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:24,134
If so, why did Mr. Itogawa try to hide the evidence?

309
00:20:25,634 --> 00:20:30,933
You came here today before the professor came, didn't you?

310
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:35,333
Mr. Itogawa realized what you did and tried to hide the evidence.

311
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,633
Look at the antenna of that cell phone!

312
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:40,833
Isn't it full of scratches?

313
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:43,133
Yeah, now that you mentioned it.

314
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:46,434
There were scratches on the telephone over there too, weren't there?

315
00:20:49,034 --> 00:20:50,533
I see.

316
00:20:50,534 --> 00:20:52,733
She used the antenna of the cell phone

317
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:54,333
and stuck the needle into the receiver.

318
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:55,834
That's when the scratches were made.

319
00:20:58,534 --> 00:20:59,734
I'm telling you, stop it!

320
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:16,833
You killed the professor

321
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:19,233
and tried to make it look as if he died accidentally.

322
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:21,633
You made Mr. Urazaki call

323
00:21:21,634 --> 00:21:25,833
because you didn't want suspicion to fall upon Mr. Itogawa or yourself.

324
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:27,734
Why did you do something like this?

325
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:31,433
Whenever the professor delivers a speech at the academic conference,

326
00:21:31,434 --> 00:21:34,533
it is Mr. Itogawa's research results.

327
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:36,833
I just couldn't take it anymore.

328
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:40,233
I was just hoping that the professor would be hospitalized

329
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:42,234
with a heart attack or something.

330
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:45,733
I didn't mean for it to turn out this way.

331
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:46,834
Miwa.

332
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:54,033
This is a crime that cannot be forgiven.

333
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:57,134
After all, you did take someone's life.

334
00:23:26,134 --> 00:23:29,333
So, the spider was innocent after all.

335
00:23:29,334 --> 00:23:32,833
Because if you take a good look at it, it's small and cute.

336
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:34,233
I guess you're right.

337
00:23:34,234 --> 00:23:37,033
Conan, there's a spider on your shoulder!

338
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:40,133
Don't worry, it's not a venomous spider.

339
00:23:40,134 --> 00:23:43,933
That spider's the one that was in the professor's breeding box!

340
00:23:43,934 --> 00:23:48,033
What? Do something, please. Haibara!

341
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:49,234
I'm just joking!

342
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:56,634
You guys! Just keep laughing.

343
00:23:58,834 --> 00:23:59,834
"Next Episode."

344
00:23:59,835 --> 00:24:02,234
Isn't that the hill?

345
00:24:04,334 --> 00:24:05,533
What?

346
00:24:05,534 --> 00:24:08,233
It's most likely that Mr. Kono left these here,

347
00:24:08,234 --> 00:24:10,834
before the killer came back down here, after pushing him off the cliff.

348
00:24:11,934 --> 00:24:13,934
Oh, no! I lost sight of him!

349
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:17,233
What is it that's bothering you?

350
00:24:17,234 --> 00:24:18,634
What was that sound?

351
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:22,734
Kudo, don't tell me you...

352
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:28,934
Next Conan, "Stars, a Cigarette and a Code (Part 1)"

353
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:46,933
Next Conan's Hint:

354
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:48,433
"Cigarette."

355
00:24:48,434 --> 00:24:50,033
Coming up next is a 1 hour special.

356
00:24:50,034 --> 00:24:52,033
-The beautiful image. -The cursed mask.

357
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:53,534
Don't miss it.
