1
00:00:28,217 --> 00:00:30,516
Is that the delivery service?

2
00:00:30,517 --> 00:00:33,216
No, I'm sure it's Mitsuhiko and his friends.

3
00:00:33,217 --> 00:00:35,416
Mitsuhiko?

4
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:36,916
He's a kid from the neighbourhood.

5
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:39,517
I promised him that I'd show him my figurines.

6
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:42,516
Are you saying a bunch of kids are coming here now?

7
00:00:42,517 --> 00:00:44,416
I was the one who invited them.

8
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:47,016
Mitsuhiko said he likes Yaiba, after all.

9
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:50,216
The contest deadline is just around the corner!

10
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,516
-I'm sorry. -Don't apologise.

11
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:56,116
Besides, Shiraishi, you're the reason we're so close to the deadline.

12
00:00:56,117 --> 00:00:57,616
What did you say?

13
00:00:57,617 --> 00:01:01,016
You got cigarette ash on it, so we had to do it all over again.

14
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:02,316
But you were the one...

15
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:03,616
Calm down, now.

16
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:06,717
They're already here, so stop fighting.

17
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:12,316
The love for deduction and the exhilaration

18
00:01:12,317 --> 00:01:14,316
of unravelling mysteries that comes before sleep!

19
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:15,916
Students fired up by figurines.

20
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:18,116
Friendships breaking apart by the fanning of flames.

21
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:19,516
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:19,517 --> 00:01:21,416
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:23,917
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:12,017
"Figurine of Revenge"

25
00:03:14,117 --> 00:03:15,516
It's beautiful.

26
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:18,616
Did everyone make all of these?

27
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:23,116
Yes, everyone here who's in the circle made them.

28
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:27,217
-I see. That's amazing! -A... a gun!

29
00:03:30,817 --> 00:03:33,117
What are you doing?

30
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:36,216
The gun is glowing!

31
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:37,917
What's going on?

32
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:42,516
It's just a lighter in the shape of a gun.

33
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:44,016
A lighter?

34
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:46,416
Ayumi?

35
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:49,116
Hey! How long are you going to hold on to him?

36
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:51,517
Get off her, Conan!

37
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:54,716
You're all moving around so much and making a lot of noise!

38
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:56,516
If you're going to be a nuisance, just go home!

39
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:59,016
Hey! That's not how you should tell them off.

40
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:00,516
What did you say?

41
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:02,316
Aoki, how about you show them

42
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:04,416
the Yaiba figurines you're so proud of?

43
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:07,916
That's right! It would be great, Aoki.

44
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:09,717
You're right.

45
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,116
That's awesome!

46
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:14,716
There are so many Yaibas!

47
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:17,616
This is a limited edition Yaiba, isn't it?

48
00:04:17,617 --> 00:04:19,816
I'll be back right away,

49
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:21,516
so you guys can hang out here in the meantime.

50
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:23,417
Sure!

51
00:04:27,217 --> 00:04:30,116
Why did you have to invite those kids?

52
00:04:30,117 --> 00:04:31,916
I said I'm sorry.

53
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:34,316
Even if we can't make it in time for the contest,

54
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:36,516
we could always display it at the university festival.

55
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:39,416
No way! We have to submit it to the contest

56
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:41,516
and win no matter what!

57
00:04:41,517 --> 00:04:44,616
I don't mind not winning the contest.

58
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,416
My future is on the line here!

59
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:50,316
Future? Do you mean your employment?

60
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:54,116
Hey, Shiraishi, are you hiding something from us?

61
00:04:54,117 --> 00:04:56,816
Shut up! It's none of your business!

62
00:04:56,817 --> 00:05:00,316
Anyway, we have to make it to the deadline, okay?

63
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:01,616
It's fine.

64
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:04,016
We only need to send pictures for the first stage of judging,

65
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:06,916
so we can just upload them to the website by the end of the day.

66
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:11,017
By the end of the day? But the deadline is tomorrow!

67
00:05:12,517 --> 00:05:16,117
Tomorrow's the anniversary of Yuri's death, so...

68
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:22,116
I'd like to visit her grave and show her our work.

69
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:26,116
It was her dream to enter the contest and win it, after all.

70
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,516
Yes. Out of all of us,

71
00:05:28,517 --> 00:05:31,416
Yuri was the one who had the most sense for it.

72
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,216
No matter how talented she was,

73
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:35,316
it doesn't matter now that she's dead.

74
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:37,216
Watch your words, Shiraishi.

75
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:40,216
Is she helping with the filing in the afterlife?

76
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:43,016
Hey, stop smoking right now.

77
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:44,717
Shiraishi!

78
00:05:54,017 --> 00:05:57,117
Outstanding Design Award, you say?

79
00:05:59,217 --> 00:06:02,017
-What? -Conan, incoming!

80
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:04,916
Go!

81
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:06,117
Come on.

82
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:09,316
Ouch!

83
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:11,316
It's you again!

84
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:13,217
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:23,016
Are you okay, Conan?

86
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:24,116
Yes.

87
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,916
Hey, Genta, what are you going to do if this breaks?

88
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:31,516
Put it back where it was and don't touch it anymore.

89
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:35,316
-I know. -Conan? Where are you going?

90
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:37,317
I'm going to the toilet! The toilet.

91
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:40,616
It's no good. It's going to leave a stain.

92
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,616
It's all right. Don't mind it.

93
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:44,916
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:46,917
The bottle is all empty now.

95
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:51,117
What is this?

96
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:54,216
This can't be.

97
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:56,016
No.

98
00:06:56,017 --> 00:06:58,416
There's no doubting it.

99
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:01,016
He's been pushed that far.

100
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:03,516
But I also understand his feelings.

101
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:06,316
After all, Yuri ended up like that because...

102
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:09,317
Yes. I can't allow it, either.

103
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:14,816
Yes, I can make it in time somehow.

104
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:19,016
So, things will go as promised, right?

105
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:22,717
If I win the contest, I'll receive a tentative offer from your company.

106
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:25,416
Conan, what are you doing over there?

107
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:26,516
Nothing.

108
00:07:26,517 --> 00:07:30,016
Mr. Mizuhara bought us some ice cream and juice drinks!

109
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,717
Come on!

110
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:35,416
There are so many of them!

111
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,316
You can choose whichever one you like.

112
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:39,116
Which one am I going to get?

113
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:41,516
Where's Shiraishi?

114
00:07:41,517 --> 00:07:43,016
He's probably working on something.

115
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:45,217
I'll bring these to him.

116
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:59,716
Shiraishi said he'll eat when he's done with some more work.

117
00:07:59,717 --> 00:08:01,017
I see.

118
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,416
That was delicious!

119
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,016
Genta, you've finished your ice cream?

120
00:08:07,017 --> 00:08:10,316
But I want to eat more!

121
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:12,116
I'll give you my share, then.

122
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,616
Really?

123
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:14,816
You can have it.

124
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:18,016
By the way, do you want to watch some Yaiba DVDs?

125
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:19,316
Yes, we do.

126
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:21,617
Just wait for a while.

127
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:29,717
Which one shall we watch?

128
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:34,917
Is it a blackout?

129
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,216
No!

130
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,816
But something must have happened in the next room!

131
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:42,817
It's dangerous in there.

132
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:44,916
Shiraishi!

133
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:47,016
Shiraishi, are you okay?

134
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:48,117
Shiraishi!

135
00:08:49,017 --> 00:08:50,316
Conan.

136
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:53,116
There seems to be an explosion.

137
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:55,116
Gosh, the door is locked!

138
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:58,316
Shiraishi, unlock the door! Shiraishi!

139
00:08:58,317 --> 00:09:01,516
Mizuhara! Bring the door key here!

140
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:03,016
Yes.

141
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:04,916
-You guys hurry on outside -Shiraishi!

142
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,316
and call the fire department!

143
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:07,416
-Got it! -Hey! Answer us!

144
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,316
-Let's go! -Yes.

145
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:12,617
-Shiraishi. -Answer us, Shiraishi!

146
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:29,916
Where were you when the fire occurred?

147
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:34,516
Yes, sir. We were with the kids in the living room.

148
00:09:34,517 --> 00:09:37,416
We all had ice cream together.

149
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:40,816
And then, there was a big explosion, and the lights went out.

150
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:43,716
That's when we heard another explosion.

151
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,916
You heard two explosions.

152
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,616
What did you do after that?

153
00:09:47,617 --> 00:09:52,016
Of course, we wanted to help Shiraishi, so we went to the workroom.

154
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:54,616
But the door was locked.

155
00:09:54,617 --> 00:09:56,516
Is it usually locked?

156
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:59,216
No, sir. The kids were visiting today,

157
00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:01,116
so maybe that's why he locked it.

158
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:03,416
So that he wouldn't be disturbed while working.

159
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:04,916
I see.

160
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:08,616
If I had found the key sooner.

161
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:11,516
So, what was the cause of the fire?

162
00:10:11,517 --> 00:10:14,516
A lighter was found on the floor,

163
00:10:14,517 --> 00:10:17,916
so it's likely the room caught fire

164
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,116
when he tried to light a cigarette or something.

165
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:22,816
Excuse me.

166
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:26,516
But there was a different noise before the lights went out.

167
00:10:26,517 --> 00:10:28,317
A different noise?

168
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:30,416
Excuse me, Inspector.

169
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:32,616
How is Shiraishi doing?

170
00:10:32,617 --> 00:10:36,316
I'm sorry to say, but he seems to have inhaled a lot of smoke,

171
00:10:36,317 --> 00:10:39,516
so by the time he was brought to the hospital, he was already...

172
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:41,217
That can't be.

173
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:48,516
I'm sure one of the sounds was not an explosion.

174
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,217
What could it be?

175
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:56,116
What are those?

176
00:10:56,117 --> 00:10:59,716
It's a rubber glove and some copper wire.

177
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:02,317
A rubber glove and some copper wire?

178
00:11:04,117 --> 00:11:06,516
The wall socket is burnt.

179
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:08,817
So that must have been what made the sound!

180
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:23,016
The fire seems to have burned the most around the rubbish bins.

181
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,617
What is this?

182
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:28,416
This must be the lighter.

183
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:32,317
But if I recall, his lighter...

184
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:36,316
That's a thinner bottle.

185
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:38,416
And not only is the bottle open

186
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:41,016
but there's also a nylon thread tied to it.

187
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:42,616
Could this be...

188
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:44,316
Hey, kid!

189
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:47,416
You shouldn't come in here without permission!

190
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,316
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:50,916
It's just that Officer Takagi

192
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:54,116
told me to ask if there were any lighters other than the one

193
00:11:54,117 --> 00:11:56,016
shaped like a gun.

194
00:11:56,017 --> 00:11:58,716
No, I don't think there were any.

195
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,516
So there weren't any other lighters?

196
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:02,916
Come on, now! Hurry out.

197
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:06,616
And one more thing. What is that?

198
00:12:06,617 --> 00:12:09,316
It's probably an exploded plastic bottle.

199
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:12,216
It changed shape because of the heat, so it's hard to tell.

200
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:15,117
An exploded plastic bottle?

201
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:19,917
He must have...

202
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:25,516
I see.

203
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,616
So that's how it is.

204
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:30,917
But why would the thinner bottle be there?

205
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:34,216
It's from Dr. Agasa.

206
00:12:34,217 --> 00:12:35,617
Hello?

207
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:41,416
Hey, Miss Saki.

208
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:45,916
Why are the windows in that room boarded up with cardboard?

209
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:49,216
Mizuhara broke the windowpane yesterday.

210
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:52,916
We put the cardboard up as a temporary measure.

211
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,516
So I see.

212
00:12:54,517 --> 00:12:57,516
But don't you usually have the window open when you're painting?

213
00:12:57,517 --> 00:12:59,616
We do have it open most of the time.

214
00:12:59,617 --> 00:13:02,016
But we thought we wouldn't be painting much today,

215
00:13:02,017 --> 00:13:03,916
so it would be okay.

216
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,617
Is everyone ready?

217
00:13:08,117 --> 00:13:11,316
We investigated the scene and found it's highly likely

218
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:15,216
that someone caused the fire on purpose.

219
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:18,016
First, about the blackout.

220
00:13:18,017 --> 00:13:21,716
The wall socket next to the TV stand is burnt.

221
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:26,616
A rubber glove and some copper wire were also found on the balcony.

222
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:29,816
In other words, we found evidence that

223
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:31,716
someone intentionally caused a blackout

224
00:13:31,717 --> 00:13:33,216
by feeding copper wire into the wall socket,

225
00:13:33,217 --> 00:13:34,616
resulting in a short circuit.

226
00:13:34,617 --> 00:13:37,116
When we heard the first explosion,

227
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:42,316
someone was next to the TV looking for Yaiba DVDs.

228
00:13:42,317 --> 00:13:44,317
It was Mr. Mizuhara.

229
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,416
What do you have to say, Mizuhara?

230
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:50,816
I don't know what you are talking about.

231
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:54,416
But why would Mizuhara do such a thing?

232
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:58,516
There were two explosions at the time of the incident, right?

233
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:01,316
I'm sure it was because the different solvents in the room

234
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:03,516
exploded at different times.

235
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:07,516
But most of the burning happened near the rubbish bins

236
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:10,316
and where Shiraishi was lying down.

237
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,516
Other areas weren't as burnt.

238
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:16,816
It means the solvents didn't explode one after another.

239
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:19,116
Speaking of which, there was an exploded plastic bottle

240
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:21,216
that fell to the floor.

241
00:14:21,217 --> 00:14:23,216
This must be it.

242
00:14:23,217 --> 00:14:26,616
It must have been filled with dry ice

243
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:29,117
and made to explode.

244
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:33,116
How would it explode?

245
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:36,916
When you put dry ice in a plastic bottle and close it,

246
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,116
the pressure from the sublimating dry ice

247
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:41,417
can make the bottle explode.

248
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:45,116
It's dangerous, so don't try it at home.

249
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,116
Yes.

250
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:51,416
The sound of the explosion was to signal the timing of the blackout.

251
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:56,116
And the blackout was the trigger that led to whatever

252
00:14:56,117 --> 00:14:57,816
caused the fire.

253
00:14:57,817 --> 00:15:00,316
This was the item that caused the fire.

254
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:04,116
This thinner bottle with a nylon thread tied to it

255
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:06,117
was found in the room.

256
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:11,616
Mizuhara, when you brought the ice cream to Shiraishi,

257
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:16,516
you had already put dry ice in a plastic bottle filled with water.

258
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:21,516
You opened the tied thinner bottle you prepared beforehand

259
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:24,516
and put it alongside the plastic bottle on a shelf next to the door

260
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:26,016
before leaving the room.

261
00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:29,717
The other end of the nylon thread was tied to the lock on the door.

262
00:15:30,717 --> 00:15:33,516
After that, the plastic bottle exploded.

263
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:36,316
The force caused the thinner bottle to fall

264
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:39,716
and pull the nylon thread so that the door is locked.

265
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:44,416
And the thinner poured out of the fallen thinner bottle.

266
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:47,916
If Shiraishi lit his cigarette at that moment,

267
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:50,316
he would ignite the thinner and cause the explosion.

268
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:54,116
However, he wouldn't necessarily think to smoke at that time.

269
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:58,316
That's why you used the sound of the plastic bottle exploding

270
00:15:58,317 --> 00:16:01,717
to cause a blackout and darken the room.

271
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:07,716
Breaking the glass window

272
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,816
and putting up cardboard as a temporary measure

273
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:11,616
were probably done for that purpose as well.

274
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:14,016
Excuse me, officers.

275
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:15,816
What do you mean by causing a blackout

276
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:18,716
because he wouldn't necessarily think to smoke at that time?

277
00:16:18,717 --> 00:16:22,216
I don't think he would smoke just because the room got dark.

278
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:25,116
Wouldn't he turn the lights on again because the room got dark?

279
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,516
But there was a blackout!

280
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:29,416
You're right.

281
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:33,116
Put yourselves in Mr. Shiraishi's shoes and think.

282
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:38,117
What would you do if a plastic bottle exploded and the room got dark?

283
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:43,517
I'd use a lighter to light up the room.

284
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:48,316
Mizuhara. To ensure that a fire would occur,

285
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:50,516
you robbed Shiraishi of his sight

286
00:16:50,517 --> 00:16:52,816
and took his smartphone and lighter out of the room.

287
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:55,716
Then, he would be forced to use the gun-like lighter

288
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:59,616
painted with glow-in-the-dark paint next to the door.

289
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:02,916
Conan found a smartphone and a lighter

290
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:05,617
in an ice cream box that was in the freezer.

291
00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:08,416
Not only that.

292
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:11,316
Judging by the severe burning in the rubbish bins,

293
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:13,916
you must have placed a lot of tissues

294
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:17,417
doused with flammable fluids in them.

295
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:20,516
How about that, Mizuhara?

296
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:22,316
What will you say to it?

297
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:24,117
I'm sorry!

298
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:29,716
Before the fire occurred, I spilt a lot of ethanol

299
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:31,516
and used the tissues to wipe it off!

300
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,116
So that's why...

301
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:34,916
Saki is not at fault here!

302
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,516
I was the one who told her to do it.

303
00:17:36,517 --> 00:17:40,117
So this is an accident! Please believe us!

304
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:43,616
The conversation I heard was indeed...

305
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,516
This can't be.

306
00:17:45,517 --> 00:17:47,316
No.

307
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,516
There's no doubting it.

308
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:52,116
He's been pushed that far.

309
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:56,516
It was the two of them noticing what Mr. Mizuhara was planning.

310
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:57,716
Wait.

311
00:17:57,717 --> 00:18:00,416
But I also understand his feelings.

312
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:03,216
After all, Yuri ended up like that because...

313
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:06,416
Yes. I can't allow it, either.

314
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:09,116
Could they... could they be the ones...

315
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:11,016
Please think of it as a coincidence!

316
00:18:11,017 --> 00:18:13,617
Gosh, so that's how it is!

317
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:17,016
Dr. Agasa? Where are you now?

318
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:19,016
As I said, it was only...

319
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:22,016
That's enough, you two.

320
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,416
It's just as the police said.

321
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:26,816
So, you are admitting to it.

322
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:30,716
-Yes. -But why would you do such a thing?

323
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:33,216
It's for Yuri's sake.

324
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:35,116
And Yuri is?

325
00:18:35,117 --> 00:18:37,716
She was a member of the circle

326
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,516
who committed suicide last year.

327
00:18:40,517 --> 00:18:44,916
The other day, I showed her parents the designs she made.

328
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,616
And I found that the design we're working on,

329
00:18:46,617 --> 00:18:49,216
which Shiraishi supposedly came up with,

330
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:51,817
was the same!

331
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,016
When I pressed him about it,

332
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:57,716
he readily admitted to stealing Yuri's designs

333
00:18:57,717 --> 00:18:59,916
for the designs he had made until now.

334
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:01,717
Not only that...

335
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:06,216
She committed suicide just because of some figurines.

336
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:08,117
What a stupid woman.

337
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,916
Yuri had looked up to Shiraishi,

338
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,716
who regularly participated in design contests,

339
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:15,816
since her high school days.

340
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:19,916
She was delighted to have been in the same circle as him.

341
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:22,316
He used those genuine feelings against her

342
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:23,916
and betrayed her,

343
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:26,416
so she despaired and killed herself!

344
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:29,116
So that's why I...

345
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:32,616
Spare the details until we're at the police station.

346
00:19:32,617 --> 00:19:34,516
Wait a moment.

347
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:35,816
Dr. Agasa?

348
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:40,116
I heard the details from Conan.

349
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:45,916
Mizuhara was the one who set up and caused the fire, correct?

350
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:51,416
But the others would have been able to help Shiraishi right away.

351
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:56,417
After all, Mizuhara's setup had failed to work.

352
00:19:57,517 --> 00:19:58,716
Officer Takagi,

353
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:01,516
where's the thinner bottle that was used to set up the fire?

354
00:20:01,517 --> 00:20:03,816
It fell in a corner of the room.

355
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:08,316
That is evidence that the setup did not work as planned.

356
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:09,716
Pardon?

357
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:11,916
Think about it carefully.

358
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:14,516
If the setup had worked,

359
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:17,416
the thinner bottle would hang from the door,

360
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,016
and the nylon thread would eventually burn up, making the bottle fall.

361
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:23,316
You would have found the bottle near the door.

362
00:20:23,317 --> 00:20:27,216
Perhaps the force of the exploding plastic bottle was so strong

363
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:30,016
the thinner bottle with the nylon thread

364
00:20:30,017 --> 00:20:32,216
was blown away by the impact.

365
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:33,616
I see.

366
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:37,417
But it is still true that the door was locked.

367
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:43,016
These two realised what Mizuhara was planning to do

368
00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:47,716
as well as the fact that the plan was highly likely to fail.

369
00:20:47,717 --> 00:20:51,316
So, when the first explosion occurred

370
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,216
and the lights went out,

371
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:56,616
they stopped Conan, who was on his way to help.

372
00:20:56,617 --> 00:20:59,917
They then waited for the second explosion.

373
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:04,016
But just as they had feared, the setup didn't work as expected,

374
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:07,016
and they had to stop Shiraishi, who was trying to escape.

375
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,416
Shiraishi!

376
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,516
Shiraishi, are you okay?

377
00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:12,416
Shiraishi!

378
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:14,216
-Aoki, open the door! -Seriously, the door's locked!

379
00:21:14,217 --> 00:21:17,416
Shiraishi, unlock the door! Shiraishi!

380
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:20,217
Mizuhara! Bring the door key here!

381
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,416
You guys...

382
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:31,316
We heard that you fought with Shiraishi.

383
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:33,016
Yes, that's right.

384
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:35,916
She was the one who came up with this design.

385
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:38,316
Shiraishi, you...

386
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:43,616
Besides, Yuri also showed us her design once.

387
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:45,216
That was when...

388
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:49,216
Yes, it kind of resembles Shiraishi's design.

389
00:21:49,217 --> 00:21:51,116
You can't do that, Yuri.

390
00:21:51,117 --> 00:21:53,716
You have to bring out more of your own individuality.

391
00:21:53,717 --> 00:21:56,817
That's right. You shouldn't just try to copy what Shiraishi had done.

392
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:01,516
Even though we didn't know it at that time,

393
00:22:01,517 --> 00:22:03,616
we had hurt Yuri's feelings.

394
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:07,117
It could be that because of us, Yuri...

397

First, we have to find out about the lovers.

398
00:23:49,817 --> 00:23:56,216
Is that so? If that is the case, we'll give our extensive support.

399
00:23:56,217 --> 00:24:00,216
The company I worked at went bankrupt all of a sudden.

400
00:24:00,217 --> 00:24:03,016
My sister was followed by a stalker.

401
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:06,416
You've had a streak of terrible luck.

402
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:08,117
If that is the case...

403
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:11,116
