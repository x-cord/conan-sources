1
00:00:01,516 --> 00:00:03,615
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,616 --> 00:00:05,715
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,716 --> 00:00:07,515
Ran's mom and my mom

4
00:00:07,516 --> 00:00:09,515
have a deduction match that even scares Pops off.

5
00:00:09,516 --> 00:00:11,115
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:13,015
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:15,116
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:57,797
Here's your dish, sir.

9
00:01:57,798 --> 00:02:01,598
It's scallop in ravioli with broccoli puree.

10
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:03,997
Looks delicious!

11
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,497
It's what you expect of a three star restaurant!

12
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:09,397
Excuse me, but will you bring wine that's suits this cuisine,

13
00:02:09,398 --> 00:02:11,597
and choose one from the expensive wines, please?

14
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,198
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:15,498 --> 00:02:19,197
Dad, are you sure? Can you pay?

16
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:20,897
Don't you worry.

17
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:23,898
I've got a big, easy job on my hands.

18
00:02:25,898 --> 00:02:28,297
I don't remember any such request.

19
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:31,797
Today, while you were in school, I got a call.

20
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:34,697
From a wealthy madam.

21
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:40,097
She says that somebody in her premises is after her husband's life,

22
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:43,897
and she will shell out 10 million yen if I find out who it is.

23
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,397
10 million yen!

24
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:46,997
I don't believe it.

25
00:02:46,998 --> 00:02:51,197
I've got the contract and 500 thousand yen deposit.

26
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:53,497
They seem to have enough evidence

27
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:55,897
that somebody on the premises is doing it.

28
00:02:55,898 --> 00:02:59,898
You just make a little use of your brain, and the case is closed!

29
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:11,098
"Two Princesses of a Kind (Part 1)"

30
00:03:11,998 --> 00:03:19,397
And? Did he find out who is after the rich man?

31
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:23,997
Well, dad went to that house

32
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:27,597
but their evidence turned out to be very weak.

33
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,297
Dad was completely at a loss what to do.

34
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:32,097
He is now drunk and asleep on the couch.

35
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:33,297
A shame.

36
00:03:33,298 --> 00:03:35,097
If he has time to drinking,

37
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:38,597
he should use it for calling the client and declining the offer.

38
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:40,897
But before calling the client,

39
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:43,297
he got happy and partied up with the neighbors,

40
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:46,197
and already used up 3 million yen.

41
00:03:46,198 --> 00:03:48,598
3 million yen, you say?

42
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,397
Holly Nelly!

43
00:03:53,398 --> 00:03:56,397
But I suppose I can manage that amount of money.

44
00:03:56,398 --> 00:03:57,897
And another thing...

45
00:03:57,898 --> 00:04:00,997
Do you have anything else to say?

46
00:04:00,998 --> 00:04:02,397
Yes.

47
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:05,398
He tried to get back the money, and...

48
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:08,597
Excuse me for interrupting.

49
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:11,298
What? He lost 5 million yen in horse racing?

50
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:16,198
I thought Pops would do it some day. And this is the day.

51
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,297
The debt in total is 8 million and 57 thousand yen.

52
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,197
What shall we do, mom?

53
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:27,097
Just leave him to fend for himself and come stay with me!

54
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:30,597
But dad talked in his sleep calling...

55
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:34,697
"Eri, help me. Eri, please."

56
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:36,797
Are you listening, mom?

57
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:38,997
Mom?

58
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:42,097
Okay. I'll be there right now, so you just wait.

59
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:44,397
What? Miss Kisaki!

60
00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:48,397
You are supposed to meet with Mrs. Nakanishi at 3 o'clock.

61
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:50,897
Would you put it off to next week?

62
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:53,597
She will talk about divorcing her husband

63
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:55,497
but she just wants to complain about him.

64
00:04:55,498 --> 00:05:00,397
Tell her I hate to get involved with the trouble my husband got into,

65
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:02,598
but I have to, and she will understand.

66
00:05:03,398 --> 00:05:04,797
Okay.

67
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:07,597
Well, Miss Kuriyama, take care of the office please.

68
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,898
Okay.

69
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:14,698
Does she really hate to, I wonder?

70
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:18,897
Help... help me.

71
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:20,598
I had enough.

72
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:23,497
He has been like this.

73
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:24,697
Gosh.

74
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:26,397
I can't. Not anymore.

75
00:05:26,398 --> 00:05:29,097
Here, I've come to you.

76
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:32,497
Now wake up, darling.

77
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,297
I'm full. I can't eat anymore.

78
00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:36,997
What?

79
00:05:36,998 --> 00:05:38,598
I can't, Yoko, dear.

80
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:44,297
What's that?

81
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:47,897
But he was really asking for help.

82
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:50,997
It could be this TV program.

83
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:53,597
This has been Yoko Okino's 4 minutes' cooking.

84
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:55,897
Until next week, everybody.

85
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,997
You could be right.

86
00:05:57,998 --> 00:06:03,797
Mom, you're not leaving us?

87
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:07,997
No, I won't do such a childish thing.

88
00:06:07,998 --> 00:06:11,097
But get this straight.

89
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:13,497
I'm doing this for you

90
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,597
and not for that dummy!

91
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:17,997
Yes, mom.

92
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:20,998
I can't eat anymore.

93
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:25,398
Childish enough.

94
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:28,397
I see.

95
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:32,597
So, somebody is after the life of that Mikio Fujieda.

96
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:34,297
You know about him, mom?

97
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:37,597
Yes, I heard about him.

98
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:41,097
He'd been playing around a lot when he was young, I heard,

99
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:44,197
and he made up to a young daughter of a wealthy man

100
00:06:44,198 --> 00:06:46,997
and got married into her family.

101
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:49,797
Then he took advantage of the money

102
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:53,097
to make a small fortune in his dubious business.

103
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:55,697
Then, the daughter is your client?

104
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:56,797
No.

105
00:06:56,798 --> 00:07:01,097
From what I heard, his wife died of an illness a half year ago,

106
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:03,097
so I suppose he got married again.

107
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:06,497
What? It's so soon after she passed away.

108
00:07:06,498 --> 00:07:09,397
Anyway, he doesn't seem to be

109
00:07:09,398 --> 00:07:12,298
the kind of person you'd want to protect his life of.

110
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:15,497
I have been waiting for you, ladies.

111
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:18,897
You're here on behalf of Mr. Kogoro Mouri, I presume?

112
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:20,097
That is correct.

113
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:27,097
I am Souhachi Ueki, the butler for the past 50 years for this house.

114
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:29,397
Please feel free to ask me for anything,

115
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:31,998
and I'll be at your service.

116
00:07:32,998 --> 00:07:34,197
Excuse me for...

117
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:36,197
You have a cold?

118
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:39,697
No. I've got chronic asthma.

119
00:07:39,698 --> 00:07:42,697
I apologize for the unpleasant sound I make.

120
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:44,398
Please come this way, ladies.

121
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,997
What a fine garden, this is.

122
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:50,597
The garden looks so well cared for.

123
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:55,097
Yes, it does. The late madam loved gardening.

124
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:56,797
With that gardener over there,

125
00:07:56,798 --> 00:07:59,797
we three used to work in the garden.

126
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:01,297
I see.

127
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:03,398
The garden is marvelous!

128
00:08:06,998 --> 00:08:09,297
Please pay no attention to him.

129
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:11,797
He used to be more sociable,

130
00:08:11,798 --> 00:08:14,597
but from about the time Mr. Fujieda came into the family,

131
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:18,697
he stopped talking to people except for Madam and me.

132
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,097
But nowadays, when I talk to him,

133
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:22,697
he does not reply at all.

134
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:25,497
He must have liked her very much.

135
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:29,097
I mean my sister that died of an illness.

136
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:33,897
This is Mr. Shigeru Fujieda, the brother of the late madam.

137
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:36,697
And who are these beautiful ladies,

138
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:37,997
and the little one?

139
00:08:37,998 --> 00:08:40,197
They are here on behalf of Mr. Mouri.

140
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:42,297
Yes, I mean, no, we are rather...

141
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:46,498
I am Eri Kisaki, the legal advisor for the Mouri Detective Agency.

142
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:51,197
I was asked to get the details of the case,

143
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:55,597
and when I talked of it to Miss Mouri, she got interested.

144
00:08:55,598 --> 00:08:57,597
Are we inconveniencing you in any way?

145
00:08:57,598 --> 00:08:59,897
Of course not.

146
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:01,697
Mr. Ueki, may I talk to you a while?

147
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:03,797
Excuse us, ladies.

148
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:05,098
See you again.

149
00:09:05,998 --> 00:09:09,697
Say! Why didn't you say you're Mrs. Mouri?

150
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:13,197
If I did, they would underrate me.

151
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:16,097
And what's more, he looks cool and cute.

152
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,598
Mom!

153
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:20,797
So, it's you.

154
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:23,297
The one who is on behalf of the detective that is fool enough

155
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:26,197
to seriously take the prank that somebody is after my life,

156
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,097
and started investigating?

157
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:32,397
Well, this is just for routine investigation.

158
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:36,397
Then, do snoop around to find the culprit.

159
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:41,597
It's one of the workers who got insulted by the words I used on them.

160
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:44,798
Why spend ten million yen on this kind of nonsense?

161
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:48,097
Just the type of man I pictured him to be.

162
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:49,098
I'm with you.

163
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:51,497
I am so sorry, ladies.

164
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:55,098
He is in a bad mood today, I guess.

165
00:09:56,698 --> 00:09:58,697
Are you his daughter, Miss?

166
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,897
No, no.

167
00:10:01,898 --> 00:10:06,197
I'm Motoka. I'm Mikio Fujieda's wife, and your client.

168
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:09,197
-What? -But you are so young.

169
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:12,997
It's love that counts not the difference of age!

170
00:10:12,998 --> 00:10:16,197
This much difference could be a crime.

171
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,997
But I'm so glad

172
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:20,697
to know that you're here on behalf of the detective.

173
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:22,497
Why, may I ask?

174
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:27,497
Because if such a beauty like you is the lover of Mikio,

175
00:10:27,498 --> 00:10:29,697
I, Motoka, can't possibly compete!

176
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:32,897
Ran, should I be happy or what?

177
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,298
I'd say marginal, mom.

178
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:39,197
Anyway, would you show me

179
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:41,697
the things that point out that someone on the premises

180
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:43,397
is after your husband's life?

181
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:47,298
Yes. They are all gathered up and in the study, so follow me.

182
00:10:48,498 --> 00:10:49,797
The memo sheets printed with a word processor that say

183
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:53,597
"Watch behind you!" and "I'll send you to heaven."

184
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:56,297
A bullet that is already used.

185
00:10:56,298 --> 00:10:59,097
They were under your husband's pillow every night

186
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:01,397
for three consecutive days.

187
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:04,697
Yes, they were. Terrifying, aren't they?

188
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:07,997
If it's for fun or a joke, it's gone too far.

189
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:09,297
And?

190
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:12,797
Did you have the police look into the finger-prints on them?

191
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:16,397
Yes. But Mikio got mad about it

192
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:18,397
and shouted, "Who did this?"

193
00:11:18,398 --> 00:11:21,497
Then he showed the things to everybody in the house.

194
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:23,897
Naturally everybody's fingerprints are on them,

195
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:26,498
and they aren't of any use.

196
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:31,198
Nobody can do anything about that.

197
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:34,997
Yes?

198
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:38,697
There's a lady who'd like to meet you.

199
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,797
What? What is she like?

200
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:46,397
She is as beautiful as the lawyer, Miss Kisaki there, madam.

201
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:48,097
What?

202
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:50,997
This time, she happens to be the real lover of...

203
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:52,597
No, Conan!

204
00:11:52,598 --> 00:11:54,897
If you have no idea of the person,

205
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:56,797
may I ask her to leave this place, madam?

206
00:11:56,798 --> 00:11:58,497
No, wait! I'll meet her.

207
00:11:58,498 --> 00:12:00,298
She is in the hall, isn't she?

208
00:12:01,998 --> 00:12:06,297
Mister, I see there are surveillance cameras here and there.

209
00:12:06,298 --> 00:12:09,097
Yes, madam. After the incident,

210
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:11,697
for security reasons, we have set up those cameras.

211
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,997
I want to have more cameras installed,

212
00:12:14,998 --> 00:12:19,597
but Mr. Fujieda says these will do because he is certain that

213
00:12:19,598 --> 00:12:22,997
someone in the house is playing a prank on him.

214
00:12:22,998 --> 00:12:26,697
And he also said that he does not want to waste money

215
00:12:26,698 --> 00:12:28,197
on a house that is going to get ruined.

216
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:30,097
Ruined?

217
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:31,697
You sneaky thief!

218
00:12:31,698 --> 00:12:34,697
What are you here for? Go home this minute!

219
00:12:34,698 --> 00:12:38,697
I know it! You're Mikio's lover!

220
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:41,197
I know you are after the inheritance.

221
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:43,097
But you won't get anything at all from us!

222
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:45,398
I told you and I tell you, I'm not for it.

223
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:49,198
Huh?

224
00:12:50,598 --> 00:12:52,097
It's Eri.

225
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:53,897
Yukiko!

226
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,198
Mom!

227
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:09,702
You and your elaborate make-up to hide your age,

228
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:15,202
but you just failed in trying, you old Teitan High Princess.

229
00:13:15,203 --> 00:13:18,502
What you said more aptly applies to you,

230
00:13:18,503 --> 00:13:21,703
you old ghoulish queen.

231
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:24,603
Wait and calm down, you two.

232
00:13:27,803 --> 00:13:30,302
It's been a long time, Yuki!

233
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:32,602
Yes, yes. You been happy?

234
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,802
What?

235
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:35,502
It's been ten years now?

236
00:13:35,503 --> 00:13:38,402
It was before you divorced Kogoro, Eri.

237
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:40,702
Not divorced yet, Yuki, just living separately.

238
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:42,602
We are still married in a way.

239
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:44,802
But it's been since the high school festival

240
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:47,002
that someone called me a princess.

241
00:13:47,003 --> 00:13:48,802
Good old days.

242
00:13:48,803 --> 00:13:51,202
That Miss Teitan High School contest

243
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:53,902
brought such enthusiasm with the Princess and Queen competition.

244
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:57,202
Miss Teitan High? Was there a contest then?

245
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,602
Well, I remember Sonoko told me something about it once.

246
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:01,902
Some 20 years ago,

247
00:14:01,903 --> 00:14:06,203
there was a legendary queen contest that shook Teitan High School.

248
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:13,202
The contestant on one side was the Princess of Teitan High,

249
00:14:13,203 --> 00:14:18,602
whose lovely look and acting power of a genius helped her debut.

250
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:19,702
And the contestant on the other side was

251
00:14:19,703 --> 00:14:22,602
with a gifted mind and who got perfect on the Todai entrance exams.

252
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:26,002
At the age of 16, she was recommended to study abroad at Harvard.

253
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:29,203
Gifted with both beauty and intelligence, the Queen of Teitan High.

254
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:35,003
But I never thought that the two were our moms.

255
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:40,402
And which one was the winner?

256
00:14:40,403 --> 00:14:42,202
Both of them were well known

257
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:44,802
and their fans all over the country came to see them.

258
00:14:44,803 --> 00:14:48,102
The commotion ended up in the competition being suspended.

259
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:49,402
I see.

260
00:14:49,403 --> 00:14:54,002
That's why there's no festival competition in Teitan High since then.

261
00:14:54,003 --> 00:14:57,102
And, who on earth is she?

262
00:14:57,103 --> 00:14:58,402
Huh?

263
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:01,402
She seems to be an acquaintance of Miss Kisaki,

264
00:15:01,403 --> 00:15:03,202
but I am very embarrassed as the wife of Mikio

265
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:06,302
if she is his lover.

266
00:15:06,303 --> 00:15:07,402
Are you?

267
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:08,802
No, I am not!

268
00:15:08,803 --> 00:15:11,302
Yusaku asked me to...

269
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:14,202
Excuse me, but aren't you Yukiko?

270
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:15,203
Yes, I am.

271
00:15:15,204 --> 00:15:19,402
I am Shigeru Fujieda. I asked Yusaku to solve the case

272
00:15:19,403 --> 00:15:21,102
and figure out the mystery.

273
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:23,602
He said he is very busy as he is engaged in a certain job right now.

274
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:26,502
So he said he would send his wife in his place.

275
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:29,003
I did not expect such a beauty.

276
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:33,702
Don't you know her?

277
00:15:33,703 --> 00:15:37,802
She was the star of the silver screen, Yukiko Fujimine.

278
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,802
Excuse me for not recognizing her.

279
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:43,202
I am not familiar with that part of the world.

280
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:47,402
Yusaku and I met at a party of mystery writers.

281
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:49,802
I talked to him the other day about when we happened to be in L.A.

282
00:15:49,803 --> 00:15:52,502
and asked him for help for what has been happened here.

283
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:55,002
Then, do you write mysteries, too?

284
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:59,602
Yes, I do. But I have no bestsellers as he does yet.

285
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:02,002
Besides, since I lost my sister,

286
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:05,302
I am just a freeloader in this house.

287
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:07,702
Unlike the newlywed Mrs. Fujieda who hired Detective Mouri

288
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:12,002
for a fee of 10 million yen to protect her husband's life,

289
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:15,302
in my case, I asked him to do the job for free.

290
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:17,502
10 million yen?

291
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:20,402
Does Kogoro ask for such a preposterous fee?

292
00:16:20,403 --> 00:16:23,502
If all he did was just ask, I'd be as happy as a lark.

293
00:16:23,503 --> 00:16:25,902
What? You don't say!

294
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:28,303
He's spent 8 million yen already?

295
00:16:29,603 --> 00:16:32,603
That's why I'm here, on his behalf.

296
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:37,902
And, where is he now?

297
00:16:37,903 --> 00:16:40,902
In the office, drunk and lying on the couch.

298
00:16:40,903 --> 00:16:44,203
He can't get up even if he wants to.

299
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:48,202
What? What's this?

300
00:16:48,203 --> 00:16:50,403
Hey! Come on!

301
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:52,702
Hey!

302
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:54,803
Ran! Where are you?

303
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:57,503
Hey!

304
00:16:58,103 --> 00:17:00,602
I see.

305
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,802
These show that it's not just a joke.

306
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:06,702
But the evidences are only those three items.

307
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:10,002
It would be a miracle if you can close in on the culprit with them.

308
00:17:10,003 --> 00:17:13,102
But we have him with us,

309
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:14,903
so the miracle could happen.

310
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:17,002
That reminds me.

311
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:20,202
You were with Conan in the last case, weren't you?

312
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:21,402
That's true.

313
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:24,602
He solved one mystery after another so quickly.

314
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:26,502
It's just what I would expect of my...

315
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,402
Of your?

316
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:30,602
Of my...

317
00:17:30,603 --> 00:17:33,502
Grandpa's brother's daughter's cousin's uncle's grandson.

318
00:17:33,503 --> 00:17:36,202
A sort of, you know.

319
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:38,103
Oh, he is, I see.

320
00:17:39,303 --> 00:17:42,402
Anyway, first we need to meet Mr. Mikio Fujieda

321
00:17:42,403 --> 00:17:43,602
and ask if he can think of anything

322
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:46,002
that may have caused someone to want to go after his life,

323
00:17:46,003 --> 00:17:48,002
and we'll start investigation from there.

324
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:50,802
That will not be possible, I should say.

325
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,502
Right now, Mr. Fujieda is reading a book

326
00:17:53,503 --> 00:17:57,002
in the audio room while listening to classical music.

327
00:17:57,003 --> 00:18:00,102
Please allow one to two hours before entering the room.

328
00:18:00,103 --> 00:18:04,302
He will really get angry if interrupted while reading.

329
00:18:04,303 --> 00:18:05,602
Is that so?

330
00:18:05,603 --> 00:18:08,502
How can he be so unconcerned

331
00:18:08,503 --> 00:18:10,102
when his life may be in danger?

332
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:12,902
But, is he safe being left alone?

333
00:18:12,903 --> 00:18:16,202
Do you care to look inside the room?

334
00:18:16,203 --> 00:18:18,903
We can watch it through the surveillance camera installed in the room.

335
00:18:29,903 --> 00:18:34,102
For a facility that was hastily built, it's great!

336
00:18:34,103 --> 00:18:37,302
I see they are still not sufficient enough, madam.

337
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:39,102
I understand. This place is so large

338
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:41,302
that it's not easy to take care of completely.

339
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:44,302
So this is the audio room,

340
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:46,602
and this is the surveillance room.

341
00:18:46,603 --> 00:18:49,902
If something happens, you'll have to take time coming up here.

342
00:18:49,903 --> 00:18:53,302
Who's on duty to monitor the room?

343
00:18:53,303 --> 00:18:56,802
Myself and the house maids take turns.

344
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,102
Wait a minute.

345
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,802
There's somebody in the garden!

346
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:01,702
-What? -Over here.

347
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:05,202
A man wearing a knit cap.

348
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,702
He is Doi, the gardener, madam.

349
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:10,702
But what is he doing at this late hour?

350
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:14,102
He is working with more care than usual.

351
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:17,003
Tomorrow is the birthday of my late sister.

352
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:21,002
Well, I have to go and finish up the manuscript.

353
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:23,302
Ueki, take care of everyone while I'm not available.

354
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:24,803
Yes, sir.

355
00:19:25,603 --> 00:19:29,902
I really want to stay longer with the beautiful ladies,

356
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:31,203
so it is regrettable.

357
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:35,902
It really is regrettable.

358
00:19:35,903 --> 00:19:37,802
-Huh? -Regret what?

359
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:42,302
Because you two competed against each other for Miss Teitan, didn't you?

360
00:19:42,303 --> 00:19:43,402
It is regrettable that the competition was suspended

361
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:45,202
before they got the final result.

362
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:47,802
-Oh, that. -But they did get the final result.

363
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:51,502
Each of us got exactly 10,000 ballots, it was a tie.

364
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:53,602
But the strange thing was that,

365
00:19:53,603 --> 00:19:56,502
the number of ballot s prepared was 20,001 ballots,

366
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:58,702
so it shouldn't have turned out a tie.

367
00:19:58,703 --> 00:20:01,002
They were one ballot short.

368
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:04,002
There was a great commotion over the missing ballot.

369
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:07,902
That's why the commendation ceremony was suspended, wasn't it?

370
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:09,502
Talk about nonsense.

371
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:13,202
But if you got that one ballot, Yuki, you would've won.

372
00:20:13,203 --> 00:20:16,802
Of course not. I couldn't win over you.

373
00:20:16,803 --> 00:20:21,402
Say. Did the ballot bear a golden color seal on it?

374
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:22,902
What? Yes, it did.

375
00:20:22,903 --> 00:20:25,402
The seal of Teitan High on it.

376
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:28,902
Then I found a ballot in dad's uniform pocket of Teitan High School.

377
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:30,602
What?

378
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:33,402
I found it when I was trying to dispose of old clothes.

379
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:37,202
So now I know. That was the ballot for the contest.

380
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:40,202
Which? Which name was on it?

381
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:43,102
Was it Eri? Or me? Which?

382
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:47,602
But dad seemed to have washed the suits with the paper in it,

383
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:49,802
and the paper was torn into pieces.

384
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:51,402
Really?

385
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:53,402
Be honest and tell the truth, Ran.

386
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:58,002
Ran, you don't have to worry about your mom.

387
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:00,002
No. I mean, honest.

388
00:21:00,003 --> 00:21:03,202
Well, you can always ask him for sure.

389
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:05,302
His hands!

390
00:21:05,303 --> 00:21:08,402
The master is holding up his hands!

391
00:21:08,403 --> 00:21:10,102
What does that mean?

392
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,902
Somebody came into the room and pointed a gun?

393
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:15,302
That can't be.

394
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:17,802
When I brought him coffee

395
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:19,602
and came out of the room just a while ago,

396
00:21:19,603 --> 00:21:23,602
I'm sure the door was locked from inside.

397
00:21:23,603 --> 00:21:25,702
It can't be! He was shot!

398
00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:28,002
He'd been shot!

399
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:29,602
Where is the spare key to the room?

400
00:21:29,603 --> 00:21:31,602
It's in my room, madam.

401
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:32,702
Go and get it quick!

402
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:35,002
Then, I will call the police.

403
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,502
And an ambulance, too.

404
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,503
Hurry and call them.

405
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:45,003
What's the matter here?

406
00:21:47,003 --> 00:21:48,602
Hey, Mikio!

407
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:50,702
Are you all right, Mikio?

408
00:21:50,703 --> 00:21:52,402
We are in a pickle.

409
00:21:52,403 --> 00:21:55,202
But did Mikio really go down?

410
00:21:55,203 --> 00:21:57,703
Yes, he did after he held up his hands.

411
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:00,903
Gun... gun shots?

412
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:03,103
Gosh!

413
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:05,302
-Would you do it, Ran? -Sure.

414
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:06,903
Do what?

415
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:17,503
Here is the key, madam.

416
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:20,403
Master!

417
00:22:21,203 --> 00:22:22,703
Master!

418
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:25,902
The worst has happened.

419
00:22:25,903 --> 00:22:27,103
It did.

420
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:01,602
"Next Episode" -We were neatly taken in.

421
00:24:01,603 --> 00:24:03,903
What? You don't mean...

422
00:24:06,703 --> 00:24:09,502
If he was being threatened with a gun pointed at him,

423
00:24:09,503 --> 00:24:11,203
why did he do such a thing?

424
00:24:12,203 --> 00:24:16,803
But the culprit couldn't deceive the eyes of the detective.

425
00:24:20,603 --> 00:24:22,203
Hey!

426
00:24:22,803 --> 00:24:28,303
Next Conan, "Two Princesses of a Kind (Part 2)"
