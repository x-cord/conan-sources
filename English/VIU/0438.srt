1
00:00:00,945 --> 00:00:02,444
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,445 --> 00:00:04,244
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,245 --> 00:00:05,744
Today, is the usual viewing things from a different angle.

4
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:08,644
Find the boy from the e-mails, that are randomly received.

5
00:00:08,645 --> 00:00:10,144
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,145 --> 00:00:11,944
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,245
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:59,414
Disasters at sea due to tsunamis, forest fires

9
00:01:59,415 --> 00:02:03,714
due to abnormally dry weather, and frequent earthquakes...

10
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:06,714
Maybe a large meteor or something's going to come falling down.

11
00:02:06,715 --> 00:02:09,514
Really, Earth really seems to be in trouble!

12
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:12,814
Well, even I, the great detective Kogoro Mouri,

13
00:02:12,815 --> 00:02:15,414
when it comes to natural disasters, my hands are tied.

14
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:17,114
Well, the way you usually carry yourself around,

15
00:02:17,115 --> 00:02:19,515
you probably wouldn't even be able to stop a child's quarrel.

16
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:24,002
Thank you, Azusa.

17
00:02:24,003 --> 00:02:26,402
Today is time off with the family day?

18
00:02:26,403 --> 00:02:27,602
No.

19
00:02:27,603 --> 00:02:30,602
After this, I'm going to check on the neighborhood pachinko parlor

20
00:02:30,603 --> 00:02:33,503
to see how well the balls come out.

21
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:36,102
Then, in the evening, I'm going to a drinking party

22
00:02:36,103 --> 00:02:37,702
held by the community committee.

23
00:02:37,703 --> 00:02:40,402
And at night, I'm going to play mahjong.

24
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:42,502
I'm really busy, you see!

25
00:02:42,503 --> 00:02:44,103
I see.

26
00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:49,702
Oh, it's nothing, please just ignore me.

27
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,402
Azusa, is something wrong?

28
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:56,202
Can you tell? That something is bothering me?

29
00:02:56,203 --> 00:02:58,502
I mean, you're being so obvious about it.

30
00:02:58,503 --> 00:03:00,302
What's troubling you?

31
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:01,802
Well, you see...

32
00:03:01,803 --> 00:03:03,703
It's this...

33
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:12,703
"Pursue the Fish Mail."

34
00:03:13,303 --> 00:03:14,303
Cell phone?

35
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:19,302
Don't tell me that a customer forgot something in this shop again and...

36
00:03:19,303 --> 00:03:22,102
Oh, no, this is mine!

37
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:26,302
Oh then, is it a mysterious crank mail or something?

38
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:31,002
Well, it is a mail all right, but it's not crank mail.

39
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:35,302
The one sending it is a 5 years old boy, named Mitsuru Osabe.

40
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:36,703
A child...

41
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:40,803
I think it's been for these past two or three months.

42
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:44,902
Welcome!

43
00:03:44,903 --> 00:03:49,502
He comes here often with his father.

44
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:51,103
Hello, Azusa.

45
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:54,802
It seems that his mother has gone back to her parental home

46
00:03:54,803 --> 00:03:56,602
and hasn't returned yet.

47
00:03:56,603 --> 00:04:00,402
So, since then, he's been mailing me a lot from his father's cell phone.

48
00:04:00,403 --> 00:04:02,702
He writes things like, "I ate up all the cucumber."

49
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:04,802
"I took a bath all by myself."

50
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:06,202
You know, daily routine things.

51
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:09,003
He sends me mail about trivial things on a daily basis.

52
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:14,402
Then, why don't you tell his father

53
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:17,002
to tell the boy to stop sending you mail?

54
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:20,302
Oh, I'm not bothered by his mails at all.

55
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:23,002
It's just that he sent me four mails already today.

56
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:24,402
Four mails?

57
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:28,002
Yes, and the contents bothers me.

58
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:29,202
The first mail says,

59
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:33,402
"Hi, Azusa. I'm out today with daddy."

60
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:35,402
"He bought me a chair and cap."

61
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:38,302
"Everybody's wearing caps, so I guess I'll wear mine too."

62
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:39,502
The second mail says,

63
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:41,302
"I'm drenching with sweat and feel crummy"

64
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:43,502
"so I'm taking off my shoes."

65
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:46,902
I wonder if he's doing something that making him sweat profusely.

66
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:50,102
"I'm hungry. I'm looking at the sign of a restaurant."

67
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:53,302
"I want to eat hamburger that you serve at your shop."

68
00:04:53,303 --> 00:04:54,902
The third mail says,

69
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:56,602
"A man wearing black glasses"

70
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:59,002
"and a woman in blue clothes are looking this way,"

71
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:00,102
"but I'm not scared."

72
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:02,002
"I'm not going to cry."

73
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:03,802
Crying?

74
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,102
I wonder if he's going through something frightening right now.

75
00:05:06,103 --> 00:05:07,502
I don't know.

76
00:05:07,503 --> 00:05:09,102
And his fourth mail says,

77
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:12,802
"Die like a fish caught in fishing net."

78
00:05:12,803 --> 00:05:15,103
Die?

79
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:18,402
And did you send him mail, Azusa?

80
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:20,002
Yes.

81
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:23,202
Like, "Where are you?" and "What are you doing?"

82
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:27,102
But I've got no replies to my questions.

83
00:05:27,103 --> 00:05:29,702
Maybe he doesn't know how to receive mail.

84
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:32,902
He can send mail, but can't receive?

85
00:05:32,903 --> 00:05:40,202
Right. It seems that he was taught how to send mail to me before,

86
00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:42,702
but as far as receiving mail, his father seems to do it for him.

87
00:05:42,703 --> 00:05:45,802
I guess he wasn't taught how to open mail

88
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,702
in order to prevent receiving spam mails.

89
00:05:48,703 --> 00:05:53,703
Which means his father is not near him?

90
00:05:55,703 --> 00:06:00,502
Come to think of it, his second mail mentioned him being hungry.

91
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:02,802
Maybe he's been left alone for quite some time.

92
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:04,502
What time did that mail come?

93
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:07,102
Yes, let's see, the first mail came...

94
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,902
At 9.07am.

95
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:11,502
The second one at 10.16am,

96
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:14,502
and the third one at 11.54am.

97
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:18,502
The fourth one came in just a while ago, at 3.02 in the afternoon.

98
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,002
The time span between the mails is getting longer each time.

99
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:24,802
Maybe Mitsuru's getting tired?

100
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:30,202
Really, what the heck is the father doing leaving his son alone?

101
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:32,602
I don't know about the father,

102
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:35,803
but I think Mitsuru is out fishing.

103
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:41,302
You idiot! I'll bet you're saying that

104
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:43,502
because the boy wrote fish caught in a net.

105
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,502
But people don't usual fish,

106
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,102
near fishermen are out fishing with their nets!

107
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:52,702
I think so too, but the first and second mail refer to fishing!

108
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,102
It seems that Mitsuru as well as the people around him

109
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:57,102
are all wearing hats.

110
00:06:57,103 --> 00:06:59,102
And besides, he mentioned that his feet were drenched with sweat.

111
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:01,302
Children don't usually wear boots,

112
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:03,902
so he's probably wearing rubber boots.

113
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:07,903
Wearing a cap, boots and sitting on a chair is?

114
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:13,102
But, if so, the people who are there fishing...

115
00:07:13,103 --> 00:07:14,402
That's right.

116
00:07:14,403 --> 00:07:18,702
Would not leave a child who is alone for such a long time unattended.

117
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:20,402
Oh, that's probably because...

118
00:07:20,403 --> 00:07:22,102
What is it, Conan?

119
00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:23,202
What?

120
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:25,702
Everybody's absorbed in fishing and...

121
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:28,602
Well, nobody noticed him.

122
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:32,103
That's why we think it's strange.

123
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:37,102
Maybe that boy has a sore neck?

124
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:39,602
What? What're you talking about?

125
00:07:39,603 --> 00:07:45,602
Because the first mail says, "everybody around him is wearing hats".

126
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:48,102
The second one says, "the sign of the restaurant".

127
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:51,902
And the third one says, "a man wearing sunglasses"

128
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:53,802
"and a woman in blue clothes".

129
00:07:53,803 --> 00:07:56,302
It seems he's only looking upwards.

130
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:59,002
If you were a small child, you would understand too, Pops.

131
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:01,702
It's kind of hard, you know.

132
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:05,202
You're talking like you turned from an adult into a child.

133
00:08:05,203 --> 00:08:08,203
I... I was just stating an example.

134
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:13,702
Hey, maybe that boy's in a car.

135
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:15,302
A car?

136
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:18,502
I mean, maybe it's not that he's looking up,

137
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:20,602
but rather, he cannot see what's below him.

138
00:08:20,603 --> 00:08:22,702
Oh, inside a car...

139
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,902
If he is sitting in the seat and writing mail,

140
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:26,902
from the hip down of the people that go by

141
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:28,802
is hidden from his view by the door.

142
00:08:28,803 --> 00:08:32,502
So maybe the third mail he sent about somebody looking towards him,

143
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:34,502
was probably one of the people who came to fish

144
00:08:34,503 --> 00:08:36,502
that was worried about him sitting alone in the car.

145
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:39,302
It's not that easy calling out to a child inside a car.

146
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:40,602
I see.

147
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,502
After they arrived at the fishing spot,

148
00:08:42,503 --> 00:08:45,302
his father for some reason disappeared.

149
00:08:45,303 --> 00:08:47,702
Having to wait for a long time inside the car,

150
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:51,202
the boy got bored and decided to send mail to Azusa,

151
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:53,702
but eventually got tired.

152
00:08:53,703 --> 00:08:56,302
But, what could've happened to his father?

153
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:59,203
I wonder if he's not coming back.

154
00:09:00,403 --> 00:09:02,003
It's this!

155
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:05,902
But this is yesterday's...

156
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:07,902
"4 Anglers Currently Missing" -If the sea is rough,

157
00:09:07,903 --> 00:09:10,102
the same thing could've happened!

158
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:13,902
And, did you call? Did you call that boy?

159
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:15,502
Yes, I tried.

160
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:18,202
But, no matter how many times I try, it won't connect!

161
00:09:18,203 --> 00:09:20,702
I wonder if he's somewhere outside the service range.

162
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:23,902
Maybe he was told by his father to switch the phone off

163
00:09:23,903 --> 00:09:25,902
after he sends mail out.

164
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:27,902
To save on power.

165
00:09:27,903 --> 00:09:30,902
Hey, have you ever heard of a fishing spot

166
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,102
that the father and son go to a lot, Azusa?

167
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:35,302
No. Not really...

168
00:09:35,303 --> 00:09:37,902
Oh, but...

169
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:40,702
One day, they were looking through a leisure magazine we have here,

170
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:43,202
and his father was saying, let's go here.

171
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:45,302
I'm sure he dog-eared it.

172
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:46,502
Show it to me, quickly!

173
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,703
Yes! I'll bring it right away.

174
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:53,802
Bad, six hours have already gone by.

175
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:55,902
I wonder what in the world happened.

176
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:59,302
I don't understand the fourth mail though.

177
00:09:59,303 --> 00:10:02,902
Die like a fish caught in fishing net?

178
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,702
I wonder if people who are there fishing will walk around

179
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:06,802
with fish in their nets?

180
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:09,902
No, they'll most probably put the fish inside a cooler box.

181
00:10:09,903 --> 00:10:14,003
If so, I wonder why Mitsuru would use that expression?

182
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:16,002
What?

183
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:18,202
There are three pages that are dog-eared?

184
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:20,902
Yes, I'm sure it's this magazine, but...

185
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:24,403
There are other customers who also dog-ear pages occasionally.

186
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:28,602
The first is Nakaarai.

187
00:10:28,603 --> 00:10:30,802
The second is Kusarazu.

188
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:33,902
And the third is Komaezaki.

189
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:36,202
They're all so far from one another.

190
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,702
Oh, it's says "Recommended Inns" here.

191
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:43,302
Today is Saturday, so maybe they were planning to spend a night there.

192
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:47,002
"Nakaarai" -There is no reservation for such a person.

193
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:48,402
I see. By the way,

194
00:10:48,403 --> 00:10:50,302
are there many people who have come fishing today?

195
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:52,702
Yes, although there is some wind,

196
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:54,802
it's slightly cloudy and great for fishing.

197
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:56,602
Wind? Maybe the tides are high

198
00:10:56,603 --> 00:10:58,402
and one of your fishing guests was taken away by the waves?

199
00:10:58,403 --> 00:11:01,202
Oh, what an unpleasant thing to say.

200
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,403
If this is a crank call, please cut it out.

201
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:09,402
"Kusarazu" -Let's see... Mr. Osabe, Mr. Osabe?

202
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,403
There's no one by that name here.

203
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:14,002
What? The weather?

204
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:17,402
It's raining, but it's easier to catch fish in this weather

205
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:19,102
so there are quite a few people here.

206
00:11:19,103 --> 00:11:22,303
With the rain and all, has there been any accidents or such?

207
00:11:24,303 --> 00:11:26,302
No.

208
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:29,002
It's drizzling off and on and there's no wind either.

209
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:32,202
"Komaezaki" -Osabe? Nope, no such guest!

210
00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:35,902
Is something the matter? You sound angry.

211
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,702
Yeah, the guests are bugging me saying

212
00:11:37,703 --> 00:11:39,502
that they can't catch even one fish!

213
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:41,002
In this sunny weather,

214
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:42,702
in a fishing spot of shallow water like ours,

215
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,902
it's easy to tell that the baits are on fishing poles.

216
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:47,702
There's no wind and the poles are easy to use.

217
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:48,703
If they want to fish that badly,

218
00:11:48,704 --> 00:11:51,302
they should improve their fishing skills, right?

219
00:11:51,303 --> 00:11:53,103
Very... very true.

220
00:11:54,903 --> 00:11:56,003
How was it?

221
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:04,603
No, it... it's mail from Mitsuru!

222
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:06,802
Call him right away.

223
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:09,002
I'm sure you'll be able to connect if you do so right now.

224
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:10,003
Yes.

225
00:12:12,603 --> 00:12:15,202
The cell phone is presently out of the service area.

226
00:12:15,203 --> 00:12:16,602
-Oh, no good. -or switched off...

227
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:17,902
Oh, no.

228
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,702
And, what does the mail say?

229
00:12:19,703 --> 00:12:21,502
Yes. Let's see.

230
00:12:21,503 --> 00:12:25,302
"I thought there was only one fish but there are three."

231
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:27,402
"How lucky the fish are."

232
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:28,902
What that supposed to mean?

233
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:30,402
I don't know.

234
00:12:30,403 --> 00:12:32,703
I though there was only one fish...

235
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:37,603
I see, so there are three fish.

236
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:53,965
Mommy.

237
00:13:01,265 --> 00:13:02,765
Mommy.

238
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,209
Why'd you leave?

239
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,010
When are you coming back?

240
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,209
I wonder if daddy left me and went some place too.

241
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,409
I've been waiting so long and he still hasn't come back.

242
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,710
How lucky the fish are.

243
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,209
How lucky the fish are.

244
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,209
I don't have the slightest idea.

245
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,709
The only thing we know is that this boy

246
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,909
is probably at one of the fishing spots of three.

247
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,409
Nakaarai, where there is wind, but great for fishing

248
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,109
because it is cloudy.

249
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,009
Kusarazu, where it is drizzling but has no wind

250
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,309
and the third, Komaezaki, where it is sunny with no wind.

251
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,309
Maybe it's Nakaarai because many fish are being caught, right?

252
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,609
No, but Kusarazu seems to be the same too.

253
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,609
The only place that is doing bad is Komaezaki.

254
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,209
But Mitsuru dog-eared the page

255
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,909
and decided on where to go just last week.

256
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,409
So as to the weather...

257
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,809
There's no connection.

258
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,109
Hey, about the no wind thing.

259
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,609
Is there a day when the wind doesn't blow at all?

260
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,809
What?

261
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,109
Well, if it's a clear day and the temperature rises...

262
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,009
Come to think of it, the guy on the phone,

263
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,209
just before hanging up said...

264
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,409
There's no wind and the fishing pole is easy to use.

265
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,610
Oh, now the wind's started to blow.

266
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,109
Hey, if Mitsuru is in the car,

267
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,209
and is looking up all the time...

268
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,709
Maybe he was daydreaming?

269
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:36,109
-What? -Because a fish can't swim above,

270
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,809
I mean it can't swim through the sky, can it?

271
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,609
What? A fish fly through the sky?

272
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,409
It doesn't say anything like that in his mail at all!

273
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,909
Look, it says, "I thought there was one fish, but there are three".

274
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,109
"I thought there was only one fish but there are three."

275
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,310
"How lucky the fish are."

276
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,409
Well, I guess so but...

277
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,009
If he's looking at that and thinking, "How lucky"...

278
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:00,509
Wouldn't it mean the three fish are swimming together?

279
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,409
Come to think of it, Mitsuru seemed lonesome

280
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,409
that his mother went back to her parental home,

281
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,409
and hasn't come back for quite a while.

282
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:10,709
Maybe he wanted to change places with the fish.

283
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:15,009
But, there are no fish in this world that swim in the sky.

284
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,209
Then, maybe he went to see that kind of a strange movie

285
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,709
with his father or something?

286
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,909
Because it was Children's Day just a while ago.

287
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,309
What? Children's Day?

288
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,709
May 5th...

289
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,210
Children's Day which means...

290
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,710
Ko... Koinobori!(Carp streamer)

291
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,109
Maybe Mitsuru could see Koinobori from where he is.

292
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,209
Koinobori are slack when there is no wind and look dead, don't they?

293
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,509
Which means he's at Kusarazu where there's no wind!

294
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,809
No, he says "I thought there was only one but there are three".

295
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,909
Which means there was no wind, but it began to blow.

296
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,010
Komaezaki, that's where we go!

297
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,010
Daddy.

298
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,610
Daddy.

299
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,109
I feel strange.

300
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,209
It's hot and I feel sick.

301
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,510
Daddy.

302
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,209
What? Heatstroke?

303
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,210
You mean Mitsuru?

304
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:27,009
Yeah, if he is locked up in a car for six hours under the hot sun,

305
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,009
it's very likely.

306
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,209
He may already be dehydrated by now.

307
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,909
By the way, Ran, did you contact the Komaezaki police?

308
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,909
Yes, but they say there are a lot of fishing spots

309
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,109
and it may be difficult to find him.

310
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,509
What shall I do? It's all my fault.

311
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:45,209
If only... if only I had told Mr. Mouri about it earlier...

312
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,009
Don't worry, we'll find him.

313
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,509
What?

314
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,610
Besides, it may be easier to find him when the sun sets.

315
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,409
Over here, we can see an overview of the town.

316
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,109
The thing to look for is the Koinobori, three of them.

317
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,609
Although Children's Day already passed,

318
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,509
there are still a lot of them left.

319
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,509
After all, it's the scenery and custom of this season.

320
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,610
It's going to be tough trying to single one out.

321
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,809
Wow! I found a really big net.

322
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,309
With that net, we can even catch a whale.

323
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,310
See, over there!

324
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:23,009
Idiot, that's a golf practice course.

325
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,109
It's surrounded by a big net so that the balls don't go flying outside.

326
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,310
So, it's not used for catching whales.

327
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,709
Don't tell me that...

328
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,409
Mitsuru saw the net and the Koinobori overlay each other and...

329
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,409
That's why he wrote that mail.

330
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:44,009
I see, a golf practice course with Koinobori nearby.

331
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,209
Where? Where? Where is it?

332
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,310
Oh!

333
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,609
There it is, over there!

334
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,010
"Parking Lot."

335
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,909
Mitsuru!

336
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,409
Where are you?

337
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,309
Please answer me!

338
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,109
This is the only parking lot where the two look

339
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,309
one on top of the other.

340
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,109
But it sure is a large place.

341
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,909
I'm sure he's some place there, though,

342
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,609
so check the inside of the cars carefully and look for him!

343
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,209
Okay.

344
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,810
Mitsuru! Mitsuru!

345
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,209
Come to think of it, it said in his mail.

346
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,609
The place where the golf practice course and the Koinobori overlap

347
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,810
as well as the place where he can see the sign of the restaurant.

348
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,110
I found him! Mitsuru is over here!

349
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,009
No good, the door is locked. It won't open!

350
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,609
Mitsuru, Mitsuru!

351
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,810
Stand back.

352
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,510
Azusa from Poirot!

353
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,309
Mitsuru!

354
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,709
Azusa, why? What's the matter?

355
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,009
Hurry, open the door!

356
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,709
But Daddy said to stay in the car.

357
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,809
It's okay. Please listen to me!

358
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,810
Oh.

359
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:13,910
Okay.

360
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,510
Mitsuru!

361
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,009
It sure feels good outside, after all.

362
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,509
Well, he looks to be...

363
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,110
Fine.

364
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,210
They're supposed to be fishing out at sea

365
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,309
and yet these poles are for river fishing...

366
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,309
There's no cooler box in sight too.

367
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,909
Why?

368
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:41,509
I wonder if Mitsuru's father came here for another reason.

369
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,809
I wonder what happened to that guy.

370
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,809
Oh, you mean that guy that got messed up in the fight.

371
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,909
Hey, the guy that got messed up in a fight, where'd he go?

372
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,409
Who the heck are you?

373
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,009
Never mind, just tell me!

374
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,309
I don't know. He seems to have been bleeding from the head, though.

375
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,509
I heard the ambulance so he was probably taken to the hospital.

376
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,610
Hospital?

377
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,810
Hey, Mitsuru!

378
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,910
-Daddy! -Mitsuru!

379
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,709
I'm glad, you're okay!

380
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,409
Where were you?

381
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,409
I was all by myself until Azusa and the others came to get me!

382
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,409
Oh, I'm sorry.

383
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,409
Oh, you're the one working at Poirot.

384
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,209
Yes, I read the mails from Mitsuru,

385
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,509
and had Mr. Mouri and the others come with me to check on him.

386
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,009
Hello.

387
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,309
Oh, thank you so very much.

388
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,809
The thing is...

389
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,309
What? You jerk!

390
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,310
You wanna fight?

391
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:40,810
Hey, stop it! Cut it out, you guys!

392
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,209
-You jerk! -Shut up!

393
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,509
Gosh!

394
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,910
Ouch.

395
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:55,009
I passed out and was at the hospital till a while ago.

396
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,009
But, Mitsuru,

397
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,310
I have a really big present in place for making you wait so long.

398
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,310
Mommy! Mommy!

399
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,309
Mommy!

400
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,909
I'm home, Mitsuru.

401
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,310
I see, his mother looks like you, Azusa.

402
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,810
Is that why he mailed me?

403
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,109
Your wife was hospitalized three months because of tuberculosis?

404
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,209
Yes, we didn't want to worry Mitsuru

405
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,209
so we told him that she went back to grandma's place.

406
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,809
They don't really allow visitors either when you have T.B. so...

407
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,409
The physical exam for whether she could be discharged or not was today.

408
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,709
Since I wanted Mitsuru to be able to see her as soon as possible,

409
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,809
I brought him along saying let's go fishing.

410
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,009
But, I was surprised out of my wits.

411
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:55,109
When I came to, my wife was worriedly watching over me instead.

412
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,609
And what about the result of the exam?

413
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:58,809
Of course.

414
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,609
I won't go anywhere anymore.

415
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,409
We'll stay together forever.

416
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,410
Really?

417
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:04,910
All right!

418
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,110
I'm glad, all three got together fine.

419
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,110
I wish all three of us can get together again soon too.

420
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,110
I guess I'll just kind of tag along then.

421
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,010
You were almost killed?

422
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,109
The method of murder is also the same.

423
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,109
This is not a coincidence.

424
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,209
It's not a coincidence for sure.

425
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,409
This novel is a warning of future murder.

426
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,109
Look out!

427
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:15,110
As long as I'm here, I won't let them kill you!

428
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,810
Why? For what reason is this person...

429
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,610
Hold it! Don't open it!

430
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:27,610
Next Conan, "So, Disappear Everybody".

431
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,509
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,909
"Novel."

433
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,209
Ran, any words for the 10th anniversary of this series?

434
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,609
Shinichi, just how long do you expect to keep me waiting?

435
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,610
-I'm sorry. -Did you say something just now?
