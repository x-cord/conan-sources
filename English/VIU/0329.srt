1
00:00:03,789 --> 00:00:05,588
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,588
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,288
The summer camp smells of crime.

4
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:10,988
The Youth Detective Squad helps out a lot.

5
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:12,588
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:14,488
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:16,989
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:59,673
Oh, hello, Megumi? It's me, Ayumi.

9
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:03,873
Megumi, about next Saturday...

10
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,173
I have something to do,

11
00:02:06,174 --> 00:02:08,973
but I'm supposed to be rabbit monitor that day,

12
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:10,673
so I was wondering if you could change places with me.

13
00:02:10,674 --> 00:02:13,473
Oh, okay! You're going out with Conan, right?

14
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:16,473
You're going camping with Conan and the others, right?

15
00:02:16,474 --> 00:02:18,373
Yeah, could you...

16
00:02:18,374 --> 00:02:20,873
Okay, I'll change with you!

17
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,973
But promise that you'll tell me about your trip like always!

18
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:26,273
Because every time you and Conan go out together,

19
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:28,373
you get mixed up in a case of one kind or another.

20
00:02:28,374 --> 00:02:30,773
Okay! I'll tell you everything that goes on!

21
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:32,874
See you! Thank you! Megumi!

22
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:35,473
All right!

23
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:39,473
I get to go camping! I get to go camping Saturday and Sunday!

24
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:42,074
Oh, no.

25
00:02:46,474 --> 00:02:48,173
I wonder why everybody seems to treat Haibara

26
00:02:48,174 --> 00:02:50,173
as if she were an adult.

27
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:53,374
Everybody tends to call her by her last name.

28
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,673
I guess it can't be helped because people who transfer over

29
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:57,873
from other schools seem mature.

30
00:02:57,874 --> 00:03:03,174
But, friends shouldn't discriminate!

31
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:06,574
"I want to call Haibara by her first name, Ai"

32
00:03:07,574 --> 00:03:13,673
"Friendship Torn Apart (Part 1)"

33
00:03:13,674 --> 00:03:16,373
Haibara and Doc are late.

34
00:03:16,374 --> 00:03:18,573
I wonder what's keeping them.

35
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:22,173
Doc's probably taking his time getting ready again!

36
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:25,773
Okay, when she comes out, I'm going to smile naturally

37
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:27,873
and say good morning to her and call her by her first name.

38
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:32,073
I wonder if she'll be offended.

39
00:03:32,074 --> 00:03:38,073
Oh, but she might just greet me intimately too.

40
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:41,073
But, in her case, most times not...

41
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:44,273
Well, it doesn't matter if she greets me the same way or not!

42
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:45,373
After all, we're friends!

43
00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:47,873
Oh, Doc! You're late!

44
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:50,073
It's way past departure time!

45
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:54,073
Sorry, sorry. It took a while for us to get prepared.

46
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:57,773
It's because you didn't get everything ready before going to sleep!

47
00:03:57,774 --> 00:03:59,373
You got me there.

48
00:03:59,374 --> 00:04:01,673
What you took time doing was not getting ready

49
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,073
but cleaning up, right?

50
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:06,073
The minute I take my eyes off you, there are heaps of trash.

51
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:07,373
Oh, good morning.

52
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:11,173
Ai... Ah...

53
00:04:11,174 --> 00:04:14,973
Oh, I think you look so sleepy, Haibara.

54
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:17,974
Sort of. Because I'm nocturnal.

55
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:23,573
Never mind.

56
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:26,074
I still have a lot of time left.

57
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:29,073
Camping! Camping!

58
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:31,073
Let's have a happy camping trip!

59
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:34,873
Camping today and camping tomorrow!

60
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,573
Camping! Camping!

61
00:04:37,574 --> 00:04:38,973
Hey, Doc.

62
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:40,873
Did you find out the meaning of that diary?

63
00:04:40,874 --> 00:04:42,673
What diary?

64
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:46,073
The diary of Mr. Itakura, the computer programmer,

65
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:48,873
who was asked by the Men in Black

66
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:51,474
to make some kind of system software!

67
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:55,873
The diary that had the secret dealings of the Black Organization

68
00:04:55,874 --> 00:05:00,873
were written in invisible ink on the blank page.

69
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:02,873
The meaning of the mysterious last word

70
00:05:02,874 --> 00:05:06,073
that was written inside!

71
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:09,173
Oh, you mean the words...

72
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:14,473
"We are trying to revive the dead"?

73
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:19,273
I have no idea what those words mean

74
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:22,173
but I've found out that the woman hates cats!

75
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:24,573
She hates cats?

76
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,873
I stopped reading then, because Ai came along,

77
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:31,073
but there was a continuation to that diary.

78
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:33,873
"After she finished saying so,"

79
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:36,973
"the meowing of the cat started getting louder behind her."

80
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:39,473
"The woman started to panic a bit and hung up the phone."

81
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:40,873
That's what was written.

82
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,173
That's like knowing nothing at all.

83
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:48,373
She could've hung up because her cat frolicked with her.

84
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:51,673
There are also people who are allergic to cats, right?

85
00:05:51,674 --> 00:05:58,173
Only if you knew more about Haibara's father, Dr. Atsushi Miyano.

86
00:05:58,174 --> 00:05:59,773
Atsushi Miyano?

87
00:05:59,774 --> 00:06:03,573
I know Dr. Miyano.

88
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:07,373
I think I met him once or twice at the invention announcement site.

89
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:09,273
You mean you know the mad scientist

90
00:06:09,274 --> 00:06:11,573
who was ousted from the scientific society?

91
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:13,673
Mad scientist?

92
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:17,373
Dr. Miyano was a nice and friendly man.

93
00:06:17,374 --> 00:06:21,173
He took a liking to my inventions too.

94
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:23,073
His wife was reticent

95
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:26,873
and you could never tell what she was thinking.

96
00:06:26,874 --> 00:06:29,973
If I remember correctly, her name was Eleina.

97
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:32,773
Eleina? You mean his wife wasn't Japanese?

98
00:06:32,774 --> 00:06:35,773
Nope. They seem to have met when she was here in Japan

99
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:39,273
as an exchange student from England.

100
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:44,373
But, I had no idea that she was Ai's mother.

101
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:50,073
I see. No wonder she looks a bit non-Japanese.

102
00:06:50,074 --> 00:06:54,373
Come to think of it, Dr. Miyano never mentioned

103
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:55,773
what he was researching...

104
00:06:55,774 --> 00:06:57,574
Hey, look ahead!

105
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,574
What's wrong?

106
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:08,473
Thank god.

107
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:09,973
Be careful, will you, Doc?

108
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:12,573
It's because you talked to me while I'm driving.

109
00:07:12,574 --> 00:07:16,573
What a big car!

110
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:18,673
Wow, fantastic.

111
00:07:18,674 --> 00:07:21,073
It looks to be a camping car.

112
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:24,673
It shouldn't be left in a place like this, it's dangerous.

113
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:27,773
Nobody seems to be inside.

114
00:07:27,774 --> 00:07:30,373
How lucky. I'm sure camping would be a lot of fun

115
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:31,873
if we get to come in a car like this!

116
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:33,873
Hey, brats!

117
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:37,773
Quit touching my car with those dirty hands of yours!

118
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:41,273
It's our best friend's precious car!

119
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:42,773
Right, Haruka?

120
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:44,673
Yes.

121
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:46,173
But, I don't think my uncle

122
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:50,373
who lent me the car would mind them just touching it.

123
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:52,973
You're kind to kids, aren't you?

124
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:57,273
You blasted me when I smoked in the car and then...

125
00:07:57,274 --> 00:07:59,973
You smoke too much, Reiji!

126
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:03,173
That's why you fell for her, right Reiji, because she's kind?

127
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:04,473
Shut up.

128
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:07,173
Oh, so it was your car.

129
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:09,273
I'm so sorry.

130
00:08:09,274 --> 00:08:11,173
It was such a rare car that I couldn't help myself.

131
00:08:11,174 --> 00:08:12,773
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:15,973
But our hands aren't all that dirty!

133
00:08:15,974 --> 00:08:17,473
Okay, sonny.

134
00:08:17,474 --> 00:08:18,774
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:23,173
Yasumi, will you come take a look?

136
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:26,573
I think the meat's just about ready, already.

137
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:30,073
Wow, it looks delicious!

138
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:32,773
The meat looks really expensive!

139
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:34,373
Would you like to join us?

140
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:35,673
Since there's some more meat left anyway.

141
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:39,273
-Are you serious? -But, that's for tonight.

142
00:08:39,274 --> 00:08:42,073
Come on, don't get stingy!

143
00:08:42,074 --> 00:08:44,473
If we run low, we can always borrow Haruka's wallet

144
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:47,373
and go get some more from the supermarket at the foot of the mountain!

145
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:48,673
Right, Haruka?

146
00:08:48,674 --> 00:08:50,173
Yes.

147
00:08:50,174 --> 00:08:51,673
Please eat to your heart's content!

148
00:08:51,674 --> 00:08:53,174
All right!

149
00:08:56,674 --> 00:08:57,773
This is delicious!

150
00:08:57,774 --> 00:09:01,073
You're members of a university club.

151
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:04,173
Yes, the name's The Outdoor Club!

152
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:06,473
We go to the mountains and the beach.

153
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:09,073
We all went to Hawaii together before too!

154
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:12,973
Well, everything is thanks to our sponsor, Haruka, though!

155
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:14,773
Not really.

156
00:09:14,774 --> 00:09:18,973
Yasumi, you're good at cooking and Reiji's a good driver.

157
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:20,573
I don't have any special talents like

158
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:24,273
picking edible mountain plants or fishing like our cook here so...

159
00:09:24,274 --> 00:09:26,474
the most I can do is dish out cash.

160
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:30,273
I'm a helpless Ms. Richie-Rich,

161
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:32,473
so the most I can do is dish out cash.

162
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:36,273
If only for once in my life, I'd like to say something like that!

163
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:37,673
No...

164
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:41,073
Honestly, you're way too good for a womanizer like Reiji!

165
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:44,473
Didn't I just tell you to shut up?

166
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:48,573
A rich friend, huh?

167
00:09:48,574 --> 00:09:51,173
They're just like Ran and Sonoko.

168
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:55,473
Are you feeling sick or something? You don't seem to be eating much.

169
00:09:55,474 --> 00:09:56,773
No.

170
00:09:56,774 --> 00:09:59,274
I was just thinking, that's how things usually are...

171
00:10:03,374 --> 00:10:05,374
Are you ready? Here goes!

172
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:29,673
-How about it? -Too bad. 10 seconds 31!

173
00:10:29,674 --> 00:10:31,673
You couldn't make it under 10 seconds!

174
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:34,873
No joke! And I was quite confident.

175
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:36,173
Too bad!

176
00:10:36,174 --> 00:10:38,573
Oh? That belt.

177
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:42,273
It's the same kind that Yoko Okino was wearing the other day!

178
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,573
That's right!

179
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:45,173
She was wearing her outfit for her new song, right?

180
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:49,273
But, I'm the one who found this first!

181
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,373
You've been wearing that a lot recently, haven't you, Yasumi?

182
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:54,873
Because it's the same as something an idol is wearing!

183
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:55,874
That's right!

184
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,473
Why don't you eat at our place for dinner

185
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:59,473
as a token of our appreciation for lunch?

186
00:10:59,474 --> 00:11:00,773
Oh, really?

187
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:03,673
Wow, that sounds great!

188
00:11:03,674 --> 00:11:06,873
I guess we can take it easy till dinner time, then!

189
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:07,974
Yeah!

190
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,573
How is it, Conan?

191
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,273
Yep, I think it's good.

192
00:11:17,274 --> 00:11:19,373
Let me taste it too!

193
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:23,573
If you taste it, half of the curry will be gone, so you may not!

194
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:25,273
Oh well, so sorry.

195
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:28,573
I'll go get the other people then!

196
00:11:28,574 --> 00:11:30,073
Oh, let's go together!

197
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:31,574
Ah... Ai...

198
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:36,073
Ai... Ice... I wonder if it'll make them happy

199
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:37,874
if I told them we also have ice cream.

200
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:40,474
I guess so.

201
00:11:45,474 --> 00:11:48,873
Wow! This curry is delicious!

202
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,173
I'd like to make our chef taste this too!

203
00:11:52,174 --> 00:11:53,973
Huh? Where's Yasumi?

204
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:57,173
I haven't seen her for quite some time.

205
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:01,773
Her bicycle's not here so it seems she's gone somewhere.

206
00:12:01,774 --> 00:12:05,073
Going shopping to the foot of the mountain is too far.

207
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:07,973
Maybe she went there.

208
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:09,873
The time is just about right too.

209
00:12:09,874 --> 00:12:11,373
There?

210
00:12:11,374 --> 00:12:16,373
There's a great place about 5 minutes uphill by car from here.

211
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:18,773
I guess I'll go look for her.

212
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:20,373
Yeah.

213
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:22,973
Do you guys want to come too? It's a nice place.

214
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:24,173
Yes, I'll go!

215
00:12:24,174 --> 00:12:28,773
Then, I guess we'll accompany you all on our Beetle too!

216
00:12:28,774 --> 00:12:31,773
Then, why don't you come with us?

217
00:12:31,774 --> 00:12:34,373
You'd like to ride the camping car, wouldn't you?

218
00:12:34,374 --> 00:12:36,174
Yes! I'd like to ride it!

219
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:41,273
Wow, fantastic! Super!

220
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:44,073
This sofa is so fluffy!

221
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:45,473
There's a TV here too!

222
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:48,873
There's a toilet and shower too!

223
00:12:48,874 --> 00:12:51,273
It's like a hotel.

224
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:53,673
This is really something.

225
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:55,473
What is that sound...

226
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,073
Oops, sounds like it's started already!

227
00:12:58,074 --> 00:12:59,673
Reiji!

228
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:01,373
Can you do what we did last year this time too?

229
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:02,474
Okay!

230
00:13:04,874 --> 00:13:05,973
What?

231
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:08,273
Oh, the sunroof.

232
00:13:08,274 --> 00:13:11,573
I'll hold you up, so would you like to take a look?

233
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:13,073
Can we see something?

234
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:14,874
You'll see!

235
00:13:17,974 --> 00:13:20,074
See, look.

236
00:13:22,374 --> 00:13:24,573
Fireworks! It's fireworks!

237
00:13:24,574 --> 00:13:26,673
Hey, I wanna see too.

238
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:29,573
It's covered by the mountains and I can't see it anymore.

239
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:31,373
Okay, let's go back inside.

240
00:13:31,374 --> 00:13:32,574
Okay.

241
00:13:33,574 --> 00:13:34,673
Don't worry.

242
00:13:34,674 --> 00:13:35,674
When we get to the top of the mountain,

243
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:37,674
you'll get to see it nice and clear!

244
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:48,773
Look out, Reiji!

245
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:50,174
What's wrong?

246
00:13:50,774 --> 00:13:54,873
I ran over something that was on the road.

247
00:13:54,874 --> 00:13:57,473
Hey, what do you mean something?

248
00:13:57,474 --> 00:14:00,074
Don't tell me that...

249
00:14:08,297 --> 00:14:09,597
Don't tell me that...

250
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:15,297
What the...

251
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:19,596
A wooden fence, wooden fence!

252
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:21,896
What the... It scared me out of my wits.

253
00:14:21,897 --> 00:14:24,096
I thought it was Yasumi.

254
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:27,396
It seems to have decayed and fell from above.

255
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:29,796
So, let's hurry to the spot!

256
00:14:29,797 --> 00:14:31,896
The fireworks might end soon.

257
00:14:31,897 --> 00:14:33,297
Okay.

258
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:53,196
Wow! How pretty!

259
00:14:53,197 --> 00:14:55,897
Tamaya!

260
00:15:01,397 --> 00:15:05,496
This is indeed a great place to watch the fireworks!

261
00:15:05,497 --> 00:15:08,396
Yes, we coincidentally found this place

262
00:15:08,397 --> 00:15:10,396
when we camped here four years ago.

263
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:13,496
It's a place that not too many people know of yet!

264
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:15,696
But, since we'll graduate and start working,

265
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:20,196
I guess this will be the last time we'll be coming here together.

266
00:15:20,197 --> 00:15:22,396
By the way, I wonder where Yasumi is.

267
00:15:22,397 --> 00:15:24,896
There are bicycle tire marks here!

268
00:15:24,897 --> 00:15:26,196
What?

269
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:28,896
By this broken fence.

270
00:15:28,897 --> 00:15:31,496
Don't tell me she fell from there or something...

271
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,296
Don't be silly.

272
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:36,896
If so, we would've found her on the road on our way here!

273
00:15:36,897 --> 00:15:37,996
But...

274
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:40,296
I'm sure that someone who recently came here

275
00:15:40,297 --> 00:15:43,596
bumped into the fence with his bicycle and broke it!

276
00:15:43,597 --> 00:15:44,597
I wonder.

277
00:15:44,598 --> 00:15:47,397
Even Yasumi is not that much of a klutz.

278
00:15:50,397 --> 00:15:53,596
But, I wonder where Yasumi disappeared to.

279
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:57,396
I was positive that she beat us to that spot.

280
00:15:57,397 --> 00:15:58,896
Yes.

281
00:15:58,897 --> 00:16:02,296
Is Yasumi a person who usually does things like that?

282
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:06,196
Yes, even last year she went there by bicycle before us

283
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:07,996
and boasted being the first one there.

284
00:16:07,997 --> 00:16:10,796
I'm sure she went to get something to eat!

285
00:16:10,797 --> 00:16:12,997
She's not you, Genta.

286
00:16:16,897 --> 00:16:18,096
Hey, Fukuura!

287
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:20,196
What now?

288
00:16:20,197 --> 00:16:22,696
She... she's there.

289
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:23,897
Yasumi.

290
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:27,596
-Yasumi? -Where?

291
00:16:27,597 --> 00:16:30,296
The road.

292
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:33,397
In the middle of the road!

293
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:44,796
The victim is Ms. Yasumi Shirafuji, age 22,

294
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:46,296
a university student.

295
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,096
Judging from the wound on her head,

296
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:51,296
it seems she probably hit her head hard on something

297
00:16:51,297 --> 00:16:52,496
and passed away.

298
00:16:52,497 --> 00:16:54,496
You mean she fell to her death?

299
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:56,096
I believe so...

300
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:58,096
Is something wrong?

301
00:16:58,097 --> 00:17:01,196
Well, she's bleeding so much and yet...

302
00:17:01,197 --> 00:17:04,596
there is virtually no blood stains on the road.

303
00:17:04,597 --> 00:17:06,596
You're right.

304
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:08,896
When is the estimated time of death?

305
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:12,196
Around 5:00 or 6:00 in the evening.

306
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:16,096
That's strange!

307
00:17:16,097 --> 00:17:18,096
You guys again.

308
00:17:18,097 --> 00:17:19,996
What's strange?

309
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:24,696
We came up this hill by car at night.

310
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:27,196
But nobody was lying on the road at that time!

311
00:17:27,197 --> 00:17:32,196
We found Yasumi when we came back down by car after a while!

312
00:17:32,197 --> 00:17:36,596
Just what do you mean? Will you give me more of the details?

313
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:41,196
Well, I brought the kids to a camping ground nearby,

314
00:17:41,197 --> 00:17:44,196
and we happened to hit it off well with these people.

315
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,296
Then we decided to ride in their camping car

316
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:50,696
and come to this scenic spot to get a view of the fireworks.

317
00:17:50,697 --> 00:17:53,796
You're friends of the victim, Yasumi?

318
00:17:53,797 --> 00:17:54,797
Yeah.

319
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,296
When we went to see the fireworks and first passed by here,

320
00:17:58,297 --> 00:18:02,096
the fireworks had already started so it was past 7pm.

321
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:05,396
Then, on our way back at about 9pm after the fireworks,

322
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:06,996
we found her.

323
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:09,396
Our friend Yasumi, who belonged to the same university club as us

324
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:12,096
lying here on the road!

325
00:18:12,097 --> 00:18:15,196
Which means that when you passed here at after 7pm,

326
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:17,896
you really saw no one lying here?

327
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:21,796
Yeah, the only thing we saw was the wooden broken part of the fence.

328
00:18:21,797 --> 00:18:22,896
A wooden fence?

329
00:18:22,897 --> 00:18:25,896
See? There's a wooden fence on top of the mountain.

330
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,496
That's where we were watching the fireworks.

331
00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:31,496
A part of the fence had broken off and fell to the road below

332
00:18:31,497 --> 00:18:33,196
so I avoided it by slamming on the brakes.

333
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:35,896
I kind of hit it a bit though.

334
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:38,296
Was it really a wooden fence?

335
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:39,596
Of course.

336
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:41,496
Only when we got to the top,

337
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:43,396
it looked more like somebody had deliberately broken it than

338
00:18:43,397 --> 00:18:45,296
as if it had naturally broken off.

339
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:46,297
I thought that

340
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:49,096
maybe Yasumi had gone through it with her bicycle

341
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:51,296
and fell off.

342
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,996
Bicycle?

343
00:18:52,997 --> 00:18:56,496
A bicycle that we had in the camping car.

344
00:18:56,497 --> 00:18:58,396
Since the bicycle was missing,

345
00:18:58,397 --> 00:19:00,096
we decided to go up the mountain

346
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,796
to that spot to watch the fireworks and look for her at the same time.

347
00:19:02,797 --> 00:19:06,296
She always liked to beat us to places too so...

348
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:08,496
But, I figured that if she did fall from the above,

349
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:12,396
we would find her bicycle or something on the road along the way,

350
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:14,497
so I didn't think much of it.

351
00:19:17,797 --> 00:19:18,997
This is...

352
00:19:20,197 --> 00:19:22,196
Let's go to the place

353
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:25,797
where you all say you watched the fireworks!

354
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:35,296
There are tire marks of a bicycle near the broken fence.

355
00:19:35,297 --> 00:19:38,296
I wonder if she fell from here after all.

356
00:19:38,297 --> 00:19:41,996
Didn't you notice any tire marks when you came here?

357
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:45,296
I did notice, but I didn't think that it there was any connection.

358
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:46,496
Inspector Megure!

359
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:48,896
What's up, Officer Takagi?

360
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,996
I found the bicycle!

361
00:19:50,997 --> 00:19:52,896
It seems to have been stuck in the bushes

362
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:54,696
on the outer side of the guard rail!

363
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:56,596
Oh, is that right?

364
00:19:56,597 --> 00:20:00,297
Let's verify it. Will you bring it here?

365
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:03,496
Yeah, no mistake about it!

366
00:20:03,497 --> 00:20:06,996
That's the bicycle we had in camping car!

367
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,496
Okay, try matching the wheel mark then!

368
00:20:09,497 --> 00:20:10,797
Yes, sir!

369
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:17,196
They seem to match!

370
00:20:17,197 --> 00:20:20,196
I see. Which means...

371
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:24,296
Yasumi came here by bicycle before you all got here,

372
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:26,196
and because it was dark,

373
00:20:26,197 --> 00:20:28,296
she stopped her bicycle a bit too late,

374
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:31,796
broke through the fence and fell over

375
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,496
hit her head somewhere on the road

376
00:20:34,497 --> 00:20:39,296
and then rolled into the bush the bicycle was found in.

377
00:20:39,297 --> 00:20:42,296
And, while you were all watching fireworks here,

378
00:20:42,297 --> 00:20:44,996
Yasumi's body that was stuck somewhere in the bushes

379
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:47,596
slipped off to the road below.

380
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:50,196
Then, on your way back from the fireworks,

381
00:20:50,197 --> 00:20:52,696
you happened to find her here.

382
00:20:52,697 --> 00:20:54,296
This looks to be an accident.

383
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:57,696
Yes. Then the thing about no blood on the road

384
00:20:57,697 --> 00:21:00,496
where she was found is understandable too.

385
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:02,796
I wonder about that.

386
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:05,896
Yasumi came here last year too, right?

387
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,796
She should've known about this open square as well as the fact

388
00:21:07,797 --> 00:21:10,796
that there is a cliff on the other side of the fence too, right?

389
00:21:10,797 --> 00:21:14,296
If so, I wonder why she crashed into the fence.

390
00:21:14,297 --> 00:21:18,996
So, it was dark and she couldn't see the fence.

391
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:21,996
If it was dark, wouldn't she try to be even more careful?

392
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:24,196
She should've known it was dangerous, right?

393
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:25,296
Well...

394
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:29,296
Maybe she was happy that she was the first one here

395
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:30,996
and got carried away?

396
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:31,997
Right!

397
00:21:31,998 --> 00:21:35,596
That's why she couldn't stop herself fast enough and fell over!

398
00:21:35,597 --> 00:21:37,496
Then...

399
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,296
Oh, watch out, Conan!

400
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:41,596
If Yasumi fell from here,

401
00:21:41,597 --> 00:21:43,996
there should be a place on the road below

402
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:48,996
where the blood stains of when she hit her are!

403
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:51,296
How about it, Officer Takagi?

404
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:56,396
Well, the shattered pieces of the broken light cover were found,

405
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:58,796
but no blood stains were found yet.

406
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:00,396
What did you say?

407
00:22:00,397 --> 00:22:02,596
Inspector, could it be that Yasumi

408
00:22:02,597 --> 00:22:04,796
did not fall to her death but rather...

409
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:08,296
Somebody deliberately left wheel tracks

410
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:10,396
and tried to make it look like an accident.

411
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:12,296
In other words, a homicide!

412
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,296
Which means that the killer is someone

413
00:22:14,297 --> 00:22:18,496
who could freely take the bicycle from the camping car.

414
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:22,196
Yeah. Her friends who belong to the same circle.

415
00:22:22,197 --> 00:22:26,797
The probability of the killer being among the three is high!

416
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:01,596
Who drives this camping car?

417
00:24:01,597 --> 00:24:05,296
It's Fukuura who used to be in a car club before.

418
00:24:05,297 --> 00:24:09,996
Hey, hey, if it's moving the car, all three of us can!

419
00:24:09,997 --> 00:24:11,197
What's this?

420
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:13,396
Don't tell me that...

421
00:24:13,397 --> 00:24:16,696
So, that's the story. I figured this case out!

422
00:24:16,697 --> 00:24:22,397
And the only one who could've worked out this trick is...

423
00:24:22,497 --> 00:24:23,896
Next Conan,

424
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:28,297
"Friendship Torn Apart (Part 2)"
