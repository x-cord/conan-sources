1
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:09,833
Hei, come on out already!

2
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,033
That's enough!

3
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:15,033
It's time to go home!

4
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:19,933
Where did he go?

5
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:43,733
Awesome!

6
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,333
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

7
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,433
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

8
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,733
Today's detective squad experiences something a bit different.

9
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:10,833
They have a treasure battle in a haunted storeroom.

10
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,533
He sees through the one and only truth.

11
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:14,433
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

12
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,533
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

13
00:02:57,426 --> 00:03:02,926
"Treasure Battle in the Monster Storage Room (Part 1)"

14
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:08,054
Okay, then. Let's review the deeds

15
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:11,254
that we the detective squad has been performing recently.

16
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:14,154
First, it's the red, white and yellow case, right?

17
00:03:14,154 --> 00:03:18,554
You mean that Kaito Sugiura's apartment arson case, right?

18
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:27,054
He said that when night comes,

19
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:29,954
there's a guy that does suspicious things!

20
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:32,854
As for Mr. Black and White,

21
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:36,654
I'll clear everything in black and white right here and now.

22
00:03:36,654 --> 00:03:42,254
Who of everyone here is the yellow arsonist?

23
00:03:43,354 --> 00:03:47,954
There was a red person and a white person written in Kaito's diary.

24
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:51,154
And the yellow person was the arsonist, right?

25
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:54,054
Conan was the black and white person, right?

26
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:57,454
Conan solved the mystery of red, white and yellow

27
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:59,054
and the culprit was arrested.

28
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:00,354
When Conan scores a point,

29
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:03,154
it's the same as we the detective squad scored the point too!

30
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:08,154
Of course, since Conan is also a member of the detective squad.

31
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:11,054
And the Ikkaku rock incident!

32
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:13,354
The message that the woman victim left behind,

33
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:16,754
"mackerel, carp, red sea bream, and flatfish".

34
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:23,254
The rock that is behind you,

35
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:24,854
there's something written on it.

36
00:04:26,254 --> 00:04:29,954
"Mackerel, carp, red sea bream and flatfish".

37
00:04:29,954 --> 00:04:31,454
Conan?

38
00:04:37,454 --> 00:04:41,054
That message was solved and the culprit was arrested.

39
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:42,254
Conan did it.

40
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:44,454
We, the detective squad did.

41
00:04:44,454 --> 00:04:46,354
Absolutely.

42
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:50,554
And the incident of the TV station that my father got messed up in.

43
00:04:53,254 --> 00:04:54,854
I'll go take a look!

44
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:55,854
Conan!

45
00:04:55,854 --> 00:04:57,754
You guys stay right there and don't move!

46
00:05:01,054 --> 00:05:04,154
Cut out playing dumb already!

47
00:05:04,154 --> 00:05:06,754
I heard with these very ears of mine

48
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:09,454
what you just spitted out, you see!

49
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:11,354
If you like,

50
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:13,954
I can shove my knuckles way down beyond your throat

51
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:15,654
and pull the Japanese paper out

52
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:19,054
along with the lunch you ate today, how about it?

53
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:23,054
Oh, no, I'll confess.

54
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:26,154
My dad really did his thing during that incident!

55
00:05:26,154 --> 00:05:30,154
But, we didn't do anything at all back then, did we?

56
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:31,854
Conan left without us.

57
00:05:31,854 --> 00:05:35,854
It's okay because dad and the detective squad did their thing.

58
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:37,354
I guess so.

59
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:40,454
Don't forget the Shirosaki Hot Spring case, too.

60
00:05:40,454 --> 00:05:43,454
Right!

61
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:45,754
In order to search for the whereabouts of Ran who disappeared.

62
00:05:45,754 --> 00:05:48,554
We, the detective squad, together with Heiji Hattori,

63
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:52,254
high school detective of the west, formed a formidable team.

64
00:05:52,254 --> 00:05:54,954
Conan rode is skateboard

65
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,554
despite using crutches and started a great chase.

66
00:05:57,554 --> 00:05:59,454
The crab bun, crab ice cream,

67
00:05:59,454 --> 00:06:02,754
and crab stick were delicious.

68
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:04,954
There were the bank robbers, too!

69
00:06:04,954 --> 00:06:06,154
And the incident that occurred

70
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:07,854
when we went to watch the Gomera movie.

71
00:06:07,854 --> 00:06:10,954
We really did out thing then, didn't we?

72
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,654
-Thanks to Conan! -You mean the detective squad did it!

73
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:18,454
I went and told Ms. Kobayashi that we finished cleaning.

74
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:21,454
Okay, then, let's head home!

75
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:26,054
What? A robbery case?

76
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:29,754
Could it be the one that was aired on TV again today?

77
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:33,854
Yes, please take care and make sure to lock the door.

78
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:35,554
They're a band of thieves that are stealing jewellery

79
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:39,354
and antiques in this vicinity,

80
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:42,454
and they've already broke into five places this month already.

81
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:46,754
But, this is an elementary school, there's nothing to steal.

82
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:49,754
No... Nothing beats prevention.

83
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:53,254
Let me know right away if something comes up.

84
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:55,054
I'll fly right over.

85
00:06:55,054 --> 00:06:56,054
Okay.

86
00:06:56,054 --> 00:06:58,654
Inspector Shiratori is here again.

87
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:00,654
He was here yesterday too, right?

88
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,754
Yep, he is a workaholic.

89
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:07,654
Yes, because the police's job is to protect the citizens.

90
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:09,854
No, Inspector Shiratori's job

91
00:07:09,854 --> 00:07:12,454
belongs with Investigations 1st division of vicious crimes.

92
00:07:12,454 --> 00:07:15,154
He mainly takes care of murder cases.

93
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:18,454
Investigations 3rd division is in charge of thefts.

94
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:21,354
Well, a flashy theft

95
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:23,954
like the one committed by Thief Kid

96
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:27,254
who gives out warnings before committing the crime

97
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:29,854
would be investigated by the 2nd division though.

98
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:31,754
Then, why's he here?

99
00:07:31,754 --> 00:07:33,654
He's not even in charge.

100
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:35,954
Oh, well, that's because...

101
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:38,054
It can't be helped, right?

102
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:41,654
To Inspector Shiratori, Ms. Kobayashi is...

103
00:07:43,054 --> 00:07:44,654
Here, this is for you.

104
00:07:44,654 --> 00:07:47,654
A token of my appreciation for helping me a while ago.

105
00:07:48,654 --> 00:07:50,754
Cherry blossoms?

106
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:53,854
Cherry blossoms are the mark

107
00:07:53,854 --> 00:07:55,954
that all the people of the police have on.

108
00:07:55,954 --> 00:08:00,654
Strong, kind, cool and the flower of justice!

109
00:08:05,254 --> 00:08:07,154
His destiny.

110
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,954
His destiny?

111
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:17,254
Hey, he told you not to say anything about it

112
00:08:17,254 --> 00:08:20,554
because he wanted to tell her himself when the time was right.

113
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:22,954
Oh, really?

114
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:24,354
Love comedy guys

115
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:27,254
who can't express their real feelings

116
00:08:27,254 --> 00:08:29,654
and cause confusion in women really annoy me.

117
00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:32,554
You better not be referring to me.

118
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,054
Well, I think you they make a good couple, though.

119
00:08:35,054 --> 00:08:36,654
She ignore me.

120
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:40,354
Ms. Kobayashi is a fan of Ranpo Edogawa and loves criminal cases.

121
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:44,754
Inspector Shiratori can probably tell her a lot the investigations.

122
00:08:45,954 --> 00:08:47,854
Talking about cases,

123
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:50,154
Mitsuhiko was saying during lunch break, wasn't he?

124
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,454
Yeah.

125
00:08:51,454 --> 00:08:54,754
Yes, right. Something about "hearty storeroom", was it?

126
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:57,854
Not hearty, but...

127
00:08:57,854 --> 00:09:00,454
haunted storeroom.

128
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:04,854
Haunted storeroom?

129
00:09:04,854 --> 00:09:07,454
Takuma in our class,

130
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:08,854
said that when he was playing hide-and-seek

131
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:11,454
at his relative's house in Beikacho 5 chome

132
00:09:11,454 --> 00:09:14,054
with his friend,

133
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:17,154
He couldn't find his friend at all

134
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:20,454
and figured that the only place left to look for him was the storeroom.

135
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:21,854
So, he climbed a tree,

136
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:25,354
and peeked into the window of the storeroom.

137
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:30,454
He said he saw expensive looking artworks inside.

138
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:32,754
He says that he also saw someone

139
00:09:32,754 --> 00:09:36,354
behind the treasure looking towards him.

140
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:42,154
Wasn't it the friend that he was playing hide-and-seek with?

141
00:09:42,154 --> 00:09:46,554
Takuma thought so to and tried to go inside,

142
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:50,254
but the door was locked and he couldn't open the door.

143
00:09:50,254 --> 00:09:52,954
Although he called his friend's name, his friend wouldn't come out.

144
00:09:52,954 --> 00:09:56,754
So he went to ask the owner of the house to open the door.

145
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:58,354
But he was told that

146
00:09:58,354 --> 00:10:01,054
the door of the storeroom hadn't been opened for years,

147
00:10:01,054 --> 00:10:03,954
so nobody could've possibly made it inside.

148
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:08,154
And, so he gave up looking for his friend?

149
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:12,454
No. Takuma insisted that someone was inside,

150
00:10:12,454 --> 00:10:14,254
and had the door opened.

151
00:10:15,254 --> 00:10:17,054
When they went inside,

152
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:21,354
the person he saw as well as all the treasure were gone.

153
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,054
Takuma was puzzled,

154
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:28,154
but heard the following story from the owner of the storeroom.

155
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:33,554
Nothing important should be placed in the storeroom.

156
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:35,754
If anything is placed inside it, it will disappear instantly.

157
00:10:35,754 --> 00:10:37,554
Because the treasure will be swallowed by the monster storeroom

158
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,554
that has a big appetite,

159
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:49,054
Don't tell me that the friend he was looking for was eaten up?

160
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:51,954
No, because he seems to have shown up

161
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:54,154
from a different place afterwards.

162
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,154
But, because of the shock,

163
00:10:57,154 --> 00:11:01,954
Takuma seems to be haunted by nightmares every night.

164
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,254
He was absent, too.

165
00:11:05,254 --> 00:11:09,954
I see. A haunted storeroom with a big appetite.

166
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:15,254
It is indeed the strange, eerie world of Ranpo Edogawa.

167
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:16,754
Ms. Kobyashi.

168
00:11:16,754 --> 00:11:19,054
Where's Inspector Shiratori?

169
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:22,854
He left a while ago, humming a tune.

170
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:25,654
Never mind that, the problem is the storeroom.

171
00:11:25,654 --> 00:11:29,054
We, the detective squad have to solve the case

172
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:31,554
of the haunted storeroom as soon as possible,

173
00:11:31,554 --> 00:11:36,254
so that Takuma won't have to worry anymore.

174
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:38,354
-Let's go! -Wait!

175
00:11:38,354 --> 00:11:43,054
I'm the advisor for the detective squad, you know? Don't ignore me!

176
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:44,854
Gosh.

177
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:50,454
If Ms. Kobayashi comes along, things get complicated.

178
00:11:50,454 --> 00:11:52,554
She would says things like don't go in there,

179
00:11:52,554 --> 00:11:54,854
or it's time to go home already.

180
00:11:54,854 --> 00:11:56,754
She will just gets in the way.

181
00:11:56,754 --> 00:12:01,254
Okay, since that storeroom in question is in 5 chome.

182
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,754
You want to get together

183
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:06,054
at the Mouri Detective Agency that's in the same district.

184
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:09,954
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Then, go inside and wait for me.

185
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,754
I'm going to leave a note to Ran

186
00:12:13,754 --> 00:12:15,754
saying that I might be coming home late today.

187
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:22,754
It's something to look forward to, isn't it? The haunted storeroom.

188
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:27,154
But, what if the storeroom is really a monster?

189
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:28,654
No need to worry.

190
00:12:28,654 --> 00:12:30,954
I'm sure that Conan will solve it

191
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:32,154
and find out that it's not a monster.

192
00:12:32,154 --> 00:12:33,454
Yes!

193
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:34,654
I agree.

194
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:37,154
Come on...

195
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:41,854
All of you are always so dependent on Conan.

196
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:46,054
Don't you want to show him what you can do without him at times?

197
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:48,454
What?

198
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:51,454
That's impossible.

199
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:54,754
Because Conan's really smart.

200
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:57,554
He knows a lot of strange things, too.

201
00:12:57,554 --> 00:13:00,954
I'm talking about your attitude.

202
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:03,454
You'll never grow up if you stay the way you are.

203
00:13:03,454 --> 00:13:04,754
Uh, where are you going?

204
00:13:04,754 --> 00:13:06,754
To the restroom.

205
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,654
I'm growing,

206
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:15,154
my mom told me that I grew again today.

207
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:19,454
But, I'd kind of like to see it.

208
00:13:19,454 --> 00:13:22,954
The surprised look on Conan's face!

209
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:32,954
Yeah!

210
00:13:32,954 --> 00:13:35,854
Yes, if only once, I'd like to see him depressed

211
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:39,054
because we solved the case without him.

212
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:41,254
No, what we just said...

213
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,254
Were all jokes.

214
00:13:43,254 --> 00:13:45,054
All lies.

215
00:13:50,154 --> 00:13:53,254
Sorry, thanks for waiting.

216
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:56,854
What're you all doing gathered around the desk?

217
00:13:56,854 --> 00:13:58,754
Nothing.

218
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,654
Pops Kogoro went to the horse race and isn't home.

219
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:05,354
Huh? Where's Haibara?

220
00:14:06,754 --> 00:14:08,154
Did you call me?

221
00:14:08,154 --> 00:14:11,154
Let's hurry over to that storeroom, then!

222
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:14,254
Let's go there quickly and solve the case in a jiffy!

223
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:18,754
No case is left unsolved when it comes to we, the detective squad!

224
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:22,654
You guys are really out to get, aren't you?

225
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,654
Oh, does it look that way?

226
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:27,554
Well, us today...

227
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:31,454
It's true, that we're slightly different from the usual!

228
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:34,454
I don't care what.

229
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:37,154
But don't let your enthusiasm get the best of you.

230
00:14:37,154 --> 00:14:38,854
Okay...

231
00:14:38,854 --> 00:14:41,554
Let's go.

232
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:54,836
Oh, you're Takuma's friends.

233
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:57,836
That's why you came to check on the storeroom?

234
00:14:57,836 --> 00:15:01,336
-Yes! -Because we're members of the detective squad!

235
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:04,536
Well, it's good that you're full of curiosity,

236
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,936
but be careful not to get too involved.

237
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:08,536
That the storeroom will eat you.

238
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:11,036
So he says.

239
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,736
We'll be fine, because most ghost stories

240
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:16,036
are illusions created out of the fear we have in our hearts.

241
00:15:16,036 --> 00:15:18,636
They are no mysteries that cannot be solved in this world.

242
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:20,636
There is no such thing!

243
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:22,636
Yeah.

244
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:27,036
It looks pretty old, but it's unexpectedly an ordinary storeroom.

245
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:31,736
It seems to have been built during the last days of Tokugawa.

246
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:40,336
What're you doing?

247
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:42,936
I'm taking pictures.

248
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:45,836
We're going to attempt solving the mystery of the storeroom soon.

249
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:47,336
So I see nothing wrong with taking pictures

250
00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:49,336
of the surroundings around the storeroom.

251
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:51,736
That's right.

252
00:15:51,736 --> 00:15:54,636
There, it's opened. Let's go inside.

253
00:15:56,736 --> 00:16:00,136
Well, there's nothing inside, though.

254
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,436
It's really spacious.

255
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:07,036
But it's pitch dark and you can't virtually see anything.

256
00:16:07,036 --> 00:16:08,936
The only thing that can barely

257
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:12,036
be seen is the light seeping in,

258
00:16:12,036 --> 00:16:15,536
from the window over there by the ceiling.

259
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:19,236
Okay, let's go take loads of pictures of inside the storeroom.

260
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:23,536
Be careful! Watch your step because it's dark.

261
00:16:25,036 --> 00:16:26,636
Conan?

262
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:29,736
Warning everybody to watch their steps

263
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:32,436
while you go and have a great fall.

264
00:16:32,436 --> 00:16:36,436
Wrong. These stairs...

265
00:16:36,436 --> 00:16:39,436
There are footprints of somebody having walked here.

266
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:45,636
Moreover, only in the centre of the storeroom.

267
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:48,436
It's not the footprints of a child.

268
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:53,136
That's an abacus?

269
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:57,036
The footprints are connected with the abacus

270
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:59,736
that is embedded into the wall.

271
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:08,236
There's something strange about the balls on the abacus.

272
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:12,236
Hey, there's nothing in there, is there?

273
00:17:12,236 --> 00:17:15,236
I'm closing the door, so come on out!

274
00:17:15,236 --> 00:17:17,236
Oh, okay.

275
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:21,136
Hey, you guys, let's go!

276
00:17:21,136 --> 00:17:23,336
Okay...

277
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:29,036
Are you satisfied, detective squad?

278
00:17:29,036 --> 00:17:31,236
Yes, sort of.

279
00:17:31,236 --> 00:17:32,436
Bye, then.

280
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:36,936
Oh, but can we check the storeroom again after sundown?

281
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:39,536
We promise to be quiet till then!

282
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:40,836
Please!

283
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:43,436
Okay, I don't mind.

284
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:46,136
I don't think you'll find anything, though.

285
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:51,836
It's that window, that Takuma looked in from, right?

286
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:55,836
Yes, because that's the only window there is.

287
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:59,236
So, let's not wait till sundown,

288
00:17:59,236 --> 00:18:01,136
but go take a look now.

289
00:18:01,136 --> 00:18:04,736
And look at the treasure that Takuma saw.

290
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:10,536
Are you okay, Conan?

291
00:18:10,536 --> 00:18:12,636
Please don't fall.

292
00:18:12,636 --> 00:18:15,336
I'll bet you won't find anything.

293
00:18:15,336 --> 00:18:17,136
We just looked inside a while ago!

294
00:18:17,136 --> 00:18:19,336
I'm just going to confirm once more.

295
00:18:19,336 --> 00:18:22,536
I'll come down as soon as I look inside the storeroom.

296
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:32,836
Bring that old man back here right away!

297
00:18:34,636 --> 00:18:36,836
Hey, I don't think there's anything, though.

298
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:39,036
See?

299
00:18:42,536 --> 00:18:45,336
No way...

300
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:48,136
And did you see anything?

301
00:18:48,136 --> 00:18:53,136
I saw it there, just a while ago.

302
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:55,736
The floor was filled with...

303
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:01,436
a heap of treasure!

304
00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:06,636
Uh, you really saw it, didn't you?

305
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:08,636
Yeah.

306
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:16,236
Just a while ago when I looked in from that window, I saw it!

307
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:19,036
The treasure filling the floor of the storeroom,

308
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:21,936
a heap of artworks and antiques!

309
00:19:23,436 --> 00:19:26,236
But, isn't there's nothing?

310
00:19:26,236 --> 00:19:28,736
That's why there's got to be something!

311
00:19:28,736 --> 00:19:31,636
A way in which the treasure is made to vanish.

312
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:34,436
Maybe the floor's rigged or maybe the ceiling.

313
00:19:35,436 --> 00:19:38,736
No, I don't think it's the ceiling.

314
00:19:38,736 --> 00:19:39,836
What?

315
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:41,736
Proof of this is this picture that was taken with the cell phone!

316
00:19:41,736 --> 00:19:45,136
This was taken when you climbed the tree

317
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:48,736
near the storeroom a while ago and looked inside.

318
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:49,936
The position of the window

319
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:53,236
is at about 2 meters from the top of the roof,

320
00:19:53,236 --> 00:19:57,936
And that window also as viewed from inside the storeroom,

321
00:19:57,936 --> 00:20:00,936
is about 2 meters from the ceiling!

322
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:04,436
In other words, there's no space on the ceiling

323
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,036
to set up some gadget!

324
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:09,136
Right.

325
00:20:09,136 --> 00:20:11,936
Then all that's left is this floor.

326
00:20:11,936 --> 00:20:15,236
Yeah. The floor probably comes off

327
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:19,036
and the real floor with the treasure all over it comes rising up.

328
00:20:19,036 --> 00:20:20,636
No!

329
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:23,736
That's not possible either!

330
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:24,936
It's impossible!

331
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:26,736
What?

332
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:30,536
Come over here and look! See, this!

333
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:34,736
The detective squad badge.

334
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:38,436
The badge is surrounded with pencil lines.

335
00:20:38,436 --> 00:20:42,436
I drew them! It's a mark showing where I put it!

336
00:20:42,436 --> 00:20:44,936
My badge is over this way!

337
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:50,836
See! Mine hasn't moved either, right?

338
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:55,036
Yeah, moreover, it's pretty far from where Genta's one is.

339
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:56,236
I see.

340
00:20:56,236 --> 00:21:00,436
In other words, there's no trace of this floor having slided

341
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:03,036
or tilted over a wide space.

342
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:06,436
Therefore, Conan's deduction about the floor opening up

343
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:10,536
and the real floor rising up is off the track.

344
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:14,436
You guys are pretty good,

345
00:21:14,436 --> 00:21:16,136
You think so?

346
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:19,936
Please wait!

347
00:21:19,936 --> 00:21:22,036
Is something the matter, Mitsuhiko?

348
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:24,536
There's something strange about this storeroom after all!

349
00:21:24,536 --> 00:21:26,536
What's strange about it?

350
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:30,836
It's gone! My badge that I'm sure I put here!

351
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:33,036
What?

352
00:21:33,036 --> 00:21:35,236
Are you sure you put it here?

353
00:21:35,236 --> 00:21:40,236
Yes, over there. I'm sure I left it standing against the wall.

354
00:21:40,236 --> 00:21:42,836
Are you sure it's not on the floor somewhere?

355
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:46,536
I looked for it but couldn't find it!

356
00:21:46,536 --> 00:21:50,936
Then, could it be that only the floor and wall around here moved

357
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:54,236
and the badge fell into the space in between.

358
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:56,736
Or...

359
00:21:56,736 --> 00:22:00,736
could it be that someone who is hiding in this storeroom took it away.

360
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,536
Someone?

361
00:22:02,536 --> 00:22:04,836
Don't tell me that...

362
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:08,136
A monster?

363
00:22:08,136 --> 00:22:10,036
No way!

364
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:11,336
Didn't you say that ghosts

365
00:22:11,336 --> 00:22:15,436
are illusions created out of the fear that people hold in their hearts?

366
00:22:15,436 --> 00:22:16,736
True.

367
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:19,136
Well, at any rate,

368
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,236
there's no doubt that something's going on in this storeroom.

369
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:25,736
A trick similar to magic,

370
00:22:25,736 --> 00:22:28,536
where the treasure can be put in and taken out in a short time.

371
00:23:54,436 --> 00:23:56,336
"Next Episode" -"Investigations should be done speedily"

372
00:23:56,336 --> 00:23:57,936
is basic!

373
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:02,436
Darn! Is it Ms. Kobayashi the one who is giving them ideas?

374
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:08,636
It seems that the floor is a bit farther than before.

375
00:24:08,636 --> 00:24:10,336
Far?

376
00:24:10,336 --> 00:24:14,236
Maybe it ate up the treasure that Conan saw a while ago,

377
00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:16,236
so the storeroom got big.

378
00:24:16,236 --> 00:24:17,836
Could it be...

379
00:24:19,236 --> 00:24:20,536
Next Conan,

380
00:24:20,536 --> 00:24:26,136
"Treasure Battle in the Monster Storeroom (Part 2)"
