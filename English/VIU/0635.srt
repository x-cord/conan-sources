1
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:04,703
The sun is grand.

2
00:00:04,703 --> 00:00:09,403
Let's fill our bodies up with its energy.

3
00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:19,503
Don't tighten up

4
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:22,703
but let loose you mind and body.

5
00:00:22,703 --> 00:00:24,903
Right, Conan?

6
00:00:24,903 --> 00:00:27,703
Yes.

7
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:30,203
Why do I have to yoga diet anyway?

8
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:33,503
Like the fog clears.

9
00:00:33,503 --> 00:00:35,603
Let's see through love and crime as well.

10
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:37,503
I participated in a diet boarding class.

11
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:39,303
A scary battle among women occurs.

12
00:00:39,303 --> 00:00:40,903
He sees through the one and only truth.

13
00:00:40,903 --> 00:00:42,903
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

14
00:00:42,903 --> 00:00:45,103
His name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:30,208
"Beware of Dieting"

16
00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:34,286
"Yoga Diet Training Studio" -You're just great, Ran!

17
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:36,586
To win an invitation ticket to a yoga studio

18
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:38,986
that famous people come to!

19
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:43,486
Yeah, but you didn't have to bring me along too, did you?

20
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:46,086
Okay! I'm going to lose weight as much as I can

21
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:47,586
in one night two days!

22
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:50,486
Don't push yourself too much at once.

23
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:51,686
Because if you damage your body,

24
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:53,786
everything you do will be in vain.

25
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:55,786
Yes, ma'am.

26
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:01,186
This sure is a wonderful yoga studio.

27
00:03:01,186 --> 00:03:04,786
Uh, what does "Chandani" mean?

28
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:08,686
It means the light of the moon in Indian.

29
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:11,086
It's the same as your name, Tsukiko.

30
00:03:11,086 --> 00:03:14,386
Yes. My parents who previously managed a yoga studio like this,

31
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:16,686
named me Tsukiko in hopes that

32
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:19,286
I would be able to take in energy from nature

33
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:21,786
and be mentally and physically healthy.

34
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:22,886
Thanks to that concept,

35
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:26,186
I've come this far with the help of all of you here.

36
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:28,586
I really appreciate it.

37
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:31,886
And the food we serve here also has a good reputation.

38
00:03:31,886 --> 00:03:34,486
"Kaoru Iimori (29), Chef" -A plentiful but low calorie menu.

39
00:03:34,486 --> 00:03:37,786
We grow all our organic vegetables here on our own!

40
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:39,686
And most important of all, the food is delicious!

41
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,286
Really?

42
00:03:42,286 --> 00:03:43,986
"Atsuko Degawa (26)" -Just like the Chef,

43
00:03:43,986 --> 00:03:46,486
the food was just showy and unsavory.

44
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:49,186
How dare...

45
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,286
Hot! What's with this?

46
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:53,086
I'll burn my tongue!

47
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:54,586
How dare you serve something like this?

48
00:03:54,586 --> 00:03:57,086
Do you want to be fired again like you did at the previous restaurant?

49
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:58,886
Fired?

50
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:00,886
Herb tea, unlike Japanese tea,

51
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:02,686
is to be made using boiling water, you see.

52
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:05,686
Then, why didn't you warn me?

53
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:08,186
I'll write up on the internet

54
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:10,986
that I got ruthless treatment here.

55
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:12,286
If I do that,

56
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:15,086
the reputation here will take a great plunge, won't it?

57
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:18,186
That's...

58
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:20,486
Atsuko.

59
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:23,286
I don't think you should go that far.

60
00:04:23,286 --> 00:04:26,886
You, an employee's daughter dare talk back to me?

61
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,486
That's right!

62
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:33,786
Get down on your hands and knees and apologize.

63
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:37,286
If you do, I don't mind forgiving you.

64
00:04:37,286 --> 00:04:38,886
What the?

65
00:04:41,186 --> 00:04:44,286
I'm so very sorry.

66
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:46,186
Tsukiko.

67
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:50,886
I'd just like you to understand that

68
00:04:50,886 --> 00:04:54,386
this is not a complaint, but rather a reasonable opinion.

69
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:04,186
No matter what happens,

70
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:08,386
let's think of how we can make our guests stay here comfortably.

71
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:12,086
Is she the daughter of the president of Degawa concierge?

72
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:13,086
I've heard before that

73
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:15,986
she's a complainer that's really tough to handle!

74
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,986
Hello? How about it?

75
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:22,486
Did everything end well?

76
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:28,286
What? You lost the suit?

77
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,286
Just what do you think you're doing?

78
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:33,886
How can you not win a suit that is filed against me?

79
00:05:33,886 --> 00:05:37,186
Huh? You want out of this case?

80
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:38,286
Fine!

81
00:05:38,286 --> 00:05:40,386
Just don't think that you can work as a lawyer

82
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:42,286
like you've been up to now!

83
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:43,986
You'll pay for this!

84
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:57,886
Don't you ever bring that dog

85
00:05:57,886 --> 00:06:00,186
anywhere near me from now on, understand?

86
00:06:02,886 --> 00:06:07,786
Is Atsuko being sued for complaining against somebody?

87
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:08,986
Yes.

88
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:11,486
Actually, there are a lot of other cases against her too.

89
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:15,186
I'm sure that she's having it tough inside.

90
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:17,186
Let's just let her be for now.

91
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:18,186
Yes, ma'am.

92
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:23,486
It looks delicious!

93
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:24,686
You can say that again!

94
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:27,886
So, this is the buffet that Chandani takes pride in.

95
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:29,286
Please help yourself to whatever you like.

96
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:30,386
-Okay! -Okay!

97
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:34,686
Please keep to each of your set calorie intake.

98
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:38,586
And, also, please take your meals to your rooms and eat there.

99
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:40,686
We don't want you comparing your meals with others

100
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:42,586
and be stressed out because you're discontented with what you dish has.

101
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:45,386
It's not good for your body and mind.

102
00:06:47,086 --> 00:06:49,186
This wrap was ripped!

103
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:52,086
Bring a new one right away!

104
00:06:52,086 --> 00:06:53,886
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:56,186 --> 00:06:58,886
She just as nasty as ever.

106
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,886
She could be bluffing courage, you know.

107
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:04,086
Well, who cares.

108
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:08,386
Well, my intake is up to 600 calories, so...

109
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,086
Slightly pickled Queen of the Night.

110
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:14,586
This smells good!

111
00:07:14,586 --> 00:07:16,586
I'm having this!

112
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:19,186
I'll try that, too!

113
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:26,686
Wait...

114
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:29,686
This dish has more inside, so I'm taking this!

115
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:32,186
The amount in all of the dishes is the same!

116
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:33,786
If so, there should be no problem

117
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,386
even if I change the dishes, is there?

118
00:07:37,386 --> 00:07:39,386
Thank you for waiting.

119
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:45,586
With my calorie intake, I can only eat one dish!

120
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:49,286
But, after all, you came here to go on a diet.

121
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:50,386
Oh.

122
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,786
The moon is starting to show from between the clouds.

123
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:56,386
The moon has the powerful strength of purification!

124
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:57,886
It's good for beauty too,

125
00:07:57,886 --> 00:08:00,186
so why don't we do yoga right now?

126
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:01,586
Not me!

127
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:03,686
I don't want to eat cold food!

128
00:08:03,686 --> 00:08:05,686
Oh, come now!

129
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:06,986
Even if your food gets cold,

130
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,886
you can warm it up in your room.

131
00:08:08,886 --> 00:08:10,286
And if you do what you have to do,

132
00:08:10,286 --> 00:08:14,286
we'll serve you these strawberries as a reward.

133
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,886
I guess I don't mind participating then.

134
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:20,186
Okay, everyone.

135
00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:21,786
After taking your meals to your room,

136
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:24,386
please gather in the yard immediately!

137
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:31,786
Are you going out?

138
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:33,486
Yes. I'm going to the fields

139
00:08:33,486 --> 00:08:36,686
to pick some vegetables for tomorrow's breakfast.

140
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:41,386
So, let's bathe in the light of the moon

141
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:44,986
everyone and feel purified and refreshed!

142
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:49,886
Atsuko?

143
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:52,586
I could never do this pose!

144
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:53,886
I quit, I quit!

145
00:08:57,586 --> 00:09:00,086
Atsuko?

146
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:05,286
What, quit bugging me, all of you?

147
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:08,386
I'm having my meal from now, so don't disturb me!

148
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:12,086
Right! I sweat a lot,

149
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:13,486
so wash it, okay?

150
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:17,986
Yasuko, are you all right?

151
00:09:17,986 --> 00:09:20,886
I'm just fine. Don't worry about me.

152
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:30,486
Hey, everyone.

153
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,286
Is anything the matter?

154
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:34,786
No, it's really no big deal.

155
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:38,086
Okay, let's call Yasuko and go back to doing yoga.

156
00:09:42,986 --> 00:09:44,786
What's that?

157
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:49,886
Yasuko?

158
00:09:57,986 --> 00:10:00,186
-Thank you very much! -Thank you very much!

159
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:05,286
Neither Atsuko nor Yasuko came, did they?

160
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:08,386
Yasuko.

161
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:10,186
Is anything wrong?

162
00:10:10,186 --> 00:10:14,286
I went over to Atsuko's room just now to check things out,

163
00:10:14,286 --> 00:10:15,886
but the door's locked

164
00:10:15,886 --> 00:10:17,786
and she didn't answer the door.

165
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:20,586
That's of concerned.

166
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,186
I'll go take a look,

167
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:24,786
so you all go have tea or something in the dining room.

168
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:26,186
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:10:32,086 --> 00:10:33,886
Okay...

170
00:10:57,886 --> 00:10:59,886
No!

171
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:01,486
What's the matter?

172
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,970
The victim is Atsuko Degawa, 26 years old.

173
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,570
The cause of death is potassium cyanide compound poisoning.

174
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,470
There seems to have been the same kind of poison

175
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,470
in the small dish on the table, too.

176
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,970
What is the estimated time of death?

177
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,170
Between the hours of 18:30-19:30.

178
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,470
That's during the 30 minutes

179
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,870
before Ms. Degawa returned from Yoga and was found.

180
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,770
Atsuko.

181
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,470
During the time her body was found,

182
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,970
the door and window were locked from the inside?

183
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,070
Yes, sir.

184
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,970
No doubt about it.

185
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,470
The room key was found in the pocket of the victim.

186
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,870
The spare key is in the safety box with a secret code lock to it.

187
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,270
Ms. Satoyama took it out

188
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,970
and brought it here to open the door of this room.

189
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,570
Suicide?

190
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,470
Atsuko was really shocked about losing the suit

191
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,770
that she was fighting over in court.

192
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,970
That's why...

193
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,970
What's this suit about?

194
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,970
She was a well-known filer of complaints.

195
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,370
Filer of complaints?

196
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,570
But she got sued over that,

197
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,370
and it seems several lawsuits had been filed against her.

198
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,170
She got a call from her lawyer in the afternoon

199
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,370
telling her that she lost the suit.

200
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,270
She stayed confined in her room all afternoon.

201
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,570
I'm sure she was depressed.

202
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,370
So, she committed suicide depressed over losing the suit.

203
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,370
Huh?

204
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,170
There's condensed milk on the strawberries.

205
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,370
True.

206
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,170
I guess she brought it in here without permission.

207
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,970
Isn't it strange that she forgot to eat her dessert?

208
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,470
Conan.

209
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,570
People who are contemplating suicide aren't composed,

210
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,470
so things like this happen.

211
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,670
Suits were filed against Atsuko from many people.

212
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,570
She was also hated,

213
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,770
so grieving over all that she...

214
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,270
Come to think of it,

215
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,770
weren't you fired from the restaurant

216
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,070
that you were working at because of Atsuko's complaint?

217
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,070
Is that true, Ms. Iimori?

218
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,170
It's true, but...

219
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,670
I didn't put any poison inside!

220
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,970
Besides, the food is all self-service.

221
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,970
How would I know what dishes that broad would pick out

222
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,870
of the several dishes that are lined out on the table?

223
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,570
True.

224
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,070
Moreover, she snatched Ran's small dish away from her too.

225
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,470
Then, what were you doing

226
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,270
while Ms. Degawa went to put her meal in her room?

227
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,470
I went to the fields about a 10 minute walk from here

228
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,570
to pick vegetables for tomorrow's lunch!

229
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,170
After that, I was in the kitchen

230
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,270
right through making preparations for tomorrow!

231
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,070
That's right.

232
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,370
I saw her working in the kitchen right through from the yard.

233
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,970
See? It's not me!

234
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,570
It could be that you pretended to go to the field,

235
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,770
but actually went back secretly to insert the poison.

236
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,870
If I remember correctly,

237
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,770
you're also able to take the keys out of the safety box, no?

238
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,370
What?

239
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,770
Kaoru! Don't tell me that you...

240
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,270
Speak for yourself! Although you pretend to be her friend,

241
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,770
didn't you actually hate her?

242
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,370
-What? -We saw, you know!

243
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,370
That you were stepping on her wear in the laundry room!

244
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,170
Is that true?

245
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,870
-Yes. -Yes.

246
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,670
I was doing Yoga with all of you too, right?

247
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,870
After I quit part way,

248
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,270
I was in the laundry room right through.

249
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,970
But, after everybody went back to do yoga,

250
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,570
you could have secret returned to that broad's room, right?

251
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,170
You could've inserted the poison then.

252
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,170
I didn't do it!

253
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,070
By the way, how about you, Ms. Satoyama?

254
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,370
I was doing Yoga with everyone.

255
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,470
She was with us right through.

256
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,470
I'm sorry. I'll get him right away!

257
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,770
Hey, wait up, Cookie!

258
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,470
There, got you!

259
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,870
There, there... Good boy, stay still, will you?

260
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,570
-He must've been really scared. -Yep.

261
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,070
I'll go put this away.

262
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,870
Put away?

263
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,970
It's gone.

264
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,270
The thing that's supposed to be here.

265
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,970
There, there, you be good now.

266
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,570
I see! I've got it!

267
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,570
I've figured out the truth of this case!

268
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,270
Okay, then, please give us the details at the station.

269
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,870
Yes, sir.

270
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,070
Sonoko, don't tell me...

271
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,570
Yeah.

272
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,170
Things are going so sluggishly that it's making me sleepy.

273
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,170
What the...

274
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,070
I can afford to lose any more of my beauty sleep,

275
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,670
so I'll solve the case right here and now!

276
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,370
What?

277
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,070
First of all, Kaoru...

278
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,570
I don't think you're aware of it,

279
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,670
but that yellow stain on your shoulders...

280
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,170
That's pollen from the Night Queen, isn't it?

281
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,770
The Night Queen is a flower with a short life span

282
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,470
going from bud to full bloom in one night after which it dies.

283
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,670
The petals of this flower are also edible.

284
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,470
Slightly pickled Night Queen was on tonight's menu, wasn't it?

285
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,570
Therefore, you definitely went to the field

286
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,270
to look for the flower.

287
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,570
Conan says he definitely saw yellow powder

288
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,970
on your clothes after you came back

289
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,270
that wasn't there when you went out.

290
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,670
Yes, I remember!

291
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,670
And, Yasuko!

292
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,770
You're not the culprit either.

293
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,970
Let's assume that Yasuko did go to Atsuko's

294
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,570
and inserted poison,

295
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,170
it would've been impossible for her

296
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,670
to lock the room from the outside.

297
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,170
Because the key was in Atsuko's pocket

298
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,270
and the spare in the safety box.

299
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,770
In other words, it means that she committed suicide after all?

300
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,670
Why don't we let the deceased rest in peace already?

301
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,070
See, the moon is beautiful

302
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,970
as if to mourn over the dead.

303
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,970
No!

304
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,670
The moon is not there to mourn over the dead

305
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,070
but rather to shine light on the truth!

306
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,370
Tsukiko.

307
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,070
The truth is you were the one who murdered Atsuko!

308
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,070
Sonoko, just what are you...

309
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,770
Tsukiko.

310
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,070
You went out of your way

311
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,270
to lure Atsuko out to do Yoga under the moonlight,

312
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:53,270
because you needed to make her take her meal to her room first.

313
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,370
Even if I were able to make her take her meal to her room,

314
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,570
I wouldn't have had the time to insert poison in her food.

315
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,070
You didn't have to

316
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,170
because the poison would've naturally made it into her food

317
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,470
because of Atsuko's certain behavior.

318
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,870
Just what do you mean?

319
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,170
Ran, think back at the time

320
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,470
we were worried and went up to her room.

321
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,770
What did she do?

322
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,770
Well...

323
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,070
I heard the bell of the microwave oven.

324
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,170
So, she could've been warming up her food.

325
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,370
Right! I'm sure that she covered her small dish

326
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,170
with Saran Wrap back then.

327
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,270
But, what's strange is,

328
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,570
I don't see a trace of the wrap that was used anywhere.

329
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,170
Come to think of it, there isn't.

330
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,070
But, what on earth does that have to do with?

331
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,470
I'm sure you've all experienced it at one time or another.

332
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,670
But when you warm something up after covering it with wrap,

333
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,770
steam turns into vapor droplets that stick to the wrap

334
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,370
and fall into the food in the dish.

335
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,070
What if poison was smeared onto the wrap?

336
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,970
I see!

337
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,070
Tsukiko.

338
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,570
You smeared poison onto a wrap

339
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,270
with a certain amount of length beforehand,

340
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,070
dried it and wrapped it back onto the roll again.

341
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,170
Then all you had to do was create a situation

342
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,770
to get Atsuko to warm up her food using the microwave

343
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,770
no matter what dish she chose and poison her to death.

344
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,870
That's an interesting deduction,

345
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:19,070
but I gave her a new roll of wrap in front of everyone, didn't I?

346
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,070
So, how could I have put poison on it?

347
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:24,370
That's how you schemed it to begin with!

348
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,370
You wanted to show all of us in front of our eyes

349
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,570
that you changed the roll of wrap.

350
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,470
I cut the box open and gave it to her, you know.

351
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,670
I didn't rig it or anything!

352
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,970
As for the Saran Wrap box,

353
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,670
if you tear the box from the side,

354
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,670
you can easily take the roll of Saran Wrap out

355
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,470
without opening the box from the front.

356
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,970
I see.

357
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,070
See? Doing yoga in the moonlight

358
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,470
and exchanging the box of Saran Wrap

359
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,770
were all secretly schemed by you!

360
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,370
Do you have proof that I did it?

361
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,870
In the first place, the wrap with the poison on it

362
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,170
is nowhere in sight, is it?

363
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,370
Of course, because you hid it in a certain place.

364
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,670
Huh? Where on earth?

365
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,070
Tsukiko. Why did you bring Cookie

366
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:11,170
who you were told never to bring back to this room again over?

367
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,970
That's...

368
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:17,170
It's because you retrieved the used Saran Wrap with poison on it

369
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,570
and hid it in Cookie's pocket.

370
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,870
Officer Chiba, please check inside Cookie's pocket!

371
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,270
Okay.

372
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,170
I found it!

373
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,870
You deceived everyone saying that you were going to check on her,

374
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,670
went to her room.

375
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,470
Then when you did, you quickly put the little bottle in the room,

376
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,470
put the used Saran Wrap in a plastic bag

377
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,870
and hid it in Cookie's pocket.

378
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,370
But, for a dog with a keen sense of smell,

379
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,470
the smell of poison is intolerable

380
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,770
even if it is put in a plastic bag.

381
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,770
Cookie who got excited started running around

382
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,370
and you lost your chance to get rid of the wrap.

383
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,970
Yes. I'm the one who did it.

384
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,170
Tsukiko. Why?

385
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:16,270
The boarding house that my parents managed three years ago

386
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,070
went bankrupt because of that woman's complaint.

387
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,470
And because of that, my parents ended up with a tremendous amount of debt

388
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,070
and eventually committed suicide.

389
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,970
Oh, no.

390
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,770
Three years since the death of my parents,

391
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,770
I established Chandani with blood, sweat and tears.

392
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,570
A week ago,

393
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,870
that woman called to make reservations.

394
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:46,970
That woman didn't even remember me, and said...

395
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,570
I hear that the number of celebrities

396
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,570
going over to your place is increasing,

397
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,570
but if you can't satisfy me, I'll run you bankrupt.

398
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,270
I couldn't forgive her!

399
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,470
I wasn't going to let a woman like her

400
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,270
do what she wants to Chandani!

401
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,870
That's why I shut her up.

402
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,870
That mouth of hers that knew only how to complain...

403
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,770
I shut it up forever!

404
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,870
"Several days later" -It's delicious!

405
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,070
Just as expected of you, Ran!

406
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,570
You win a sweets buffet this time!

407
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,770
To exercise well, then enjoy eating!

408
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,870
Both are important!

409
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,970
Exactly!

410
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,970
Don't blame me if you end up with a super rebound of weight.

411
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:57,070
"Next Episode" -I will gladly accept the offer to perform!

412
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,670
They're asking Dad to appear on

413
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,370
"The Most Useful School in the World" show as an instructor.

414
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,970
Principal Sakai!

415
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,670
It's Vice Principal Ueda!

416
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,070
Class representative Arita is also here!

417
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,470
About how much does that vase cost?

418
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,870
Around 160 million yen?

419
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,470
This is a super treasure

420
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,070
that even Thief Kid would go pale thinking about!

421
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,370
Next Conan,

422
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,570
"The Most Useful School in the World Case (Part 1)"
