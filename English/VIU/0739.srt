1
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:10,575
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

2
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:14,475
If there's an ocean, there are fish.

3
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:17,175
Like so, I happen to be at the scene of a crime.

4
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:21,975
It all started when I got a job request from a woman bartender,

5
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:25,275
Yuzuki Fukui, who's in love with me,

6
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,175
and came to the pool bar where she works.

7
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:30,575
Her request was for me to solve a queer mystery.

8
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:34,175
In which during work, she would hear a popping sound

9
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:36,075
like that of a champagne bottle being opened

10
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:41,875
and then smell the fragrance of yuzu soon after that.

11
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:47,375
When I was racking my brains trying to solve this mystery,

12
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:52,075
one of the four people who was sitting behind me

13
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:54,575
was suddenly killed.

14
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:58,275
The victim is Chikafumi Usuda, age 51.

15
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:00,875
He seems to be the department head of some company.

16
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,575
He was killed by poisoning.

17
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:06,375
It seems that the perp used something like an eyeleteer,

18
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,675
laced the sharp tip of it with nerve poison

19
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:13,175
and poked it in behind his neck.

20
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:15,475
The suspects are the three who say

21
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:18,975
they were celebrating the victim's birthday at this shop.

22
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:22,575
Kensaku Hatsumura, age 31,

23
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:25,975
who was told to buy a billiard cue for Usuda's birthday.

24
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:31,775
Likewise, Monpei Kogure, age 28 was told to buy darts.

25
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:34,875
And the one who was told to buy a rare poster of Yoko Okino

26
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:40,675
along with a lot of film was Mika Kishiura, age 30.

27
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:44,075
Although the most suspicious were Kogure who brought the darts

28
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:45,675
and Kishiura who was crushing ice

29
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:48,675
for whiskey and water using the ice pick.

30
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:52,775
So...

31
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:54,275
I guess I'll have to solve the case

32
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:57,075
without sleeping tonight.

33
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:14,175
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

34
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,075
are slashed by the light of deduction.

35
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:17,775
A deduction show at Blue Parrot.

36
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:19,975
Expose the trick of the hidden murder weapon.

37
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:21,675
He sees through the one and only truth.

38
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,575
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

39
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:26,175
His name is Detective Conan!

40
00:03:54,625 --> 00:04:00,225
"Kogoro is at the Bar (Part 2)"

41
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,425
What?

42
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:08,125
There was no trace of poison being laced?

43
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,825
Not even on the darts or the ice pick?

44
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:13,525
No, sir. According to forensics,

45
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:17,125
neither poison nor luminol reaction was detected.

46
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:22,225
Of course the three were checked, weren't they?

47
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:23,325
Yes.

48
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:29,225
None of the three possessed poisoned bottles or bags.

49
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:31,025
I see.

50
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:33,825
What's going on? No murder weapon.

51
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:37,625
It's the same as the pick-pocket case the other day.

52
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,725
Talking about the pick-pocket case, Inspector...

53
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:43,025
Did you tell Jodie about the incident?

54
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:45,725
No. She's an outsider.

55
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:47,425
There's no need to tell her about it.

56
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:49,525
I guess so.

57
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:51,425
Officer Takagi.

58
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,325
-What incident is it? -What?

59
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:55,425
Well, the thing is...

60
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:57,525
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

61
00:04:57,525 --> 00:04:59,825
We're going to search inside the shop once again.

62
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:01,225
Yes, sir!

63
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,325
I wonder what "the incident"

64
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:22,625
that Officer Takagi mentioned was about?

65
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:26,425
The thing that bothered me about that incident

66
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:28,525
was just that pregnant lady.

67
00:05:31,725 --> 00:05:33,325
What's that?

68
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,825
Yuzuki.

69
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:46,625
What is it, Conan?

70
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:50,025
What's that hanging down from the ceiling?

71
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:53,525
That's a torn piece of braided tinsel.

72
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:55,525
A torn piece of braided tinsel?

73
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:58,925
Right! It was stuck to the ceiling with a thumbtack,

74
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,825
but when I pulled it in order to remove it, it tore.

75
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:04,025
There were customers who reserved this shop last week

76
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:07,025
that held a party here, you see.

77
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:09,825
The ceiling here is dark so it's not too conspicuous,

78
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:12,125
that's why I just left it as is.

79
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,925
But I guess it's quite visible?

80
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:18,225
Yes! When I talk to adults, I look up, you see.

81
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:19,725
I see.

82
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:21,525
But I guess since you're always looking up,

83
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:25,425
your attention isn't on the ground below, is it, Mr. Detective?

84
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:28,125
-What? -Look!

85
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,325
On the sole of Mr. Mouri's shoe.

86
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:32,925
There's gum stuck on it, isn't there?

87
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:36,825
When he bent over to the corpse the first time, it wasn't there.

88
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:39,525
I wonder where he stepped on it?

89
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,825
How about it? Did you find anything?

90
00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:43,825
No, nothing, sir.

91
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:45,425
Don't move!

92
00:06:45,425 --> 00:06:48,725
Pops, it seems you stepped on the evidence.

93
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:49,925
What?

94
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:51,625
Officer Takagi, remove it for him!

95
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,125
Yes, sir!

96
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:59,625
This is not gum but clay.

97
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:04,925
-Something's molded on it. -What?

98
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:10,525
It looks to be 4 mirror image alphabets, E P D H,

99
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:14,025
and on top of it, there's a protruded part.

100
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:18,125
If the letters EPDH are mirrored images,

101
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,125
then the correct line up would be HDPE.

102
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,325
High density polyethylene.

103
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:25,225
In other words, plastic?

104
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:27,225
And the protrusion was because

105
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:31,025
the part where the clay was stuck onto was dented.

106
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:36,025
Which means, it was attached to the bottom of that thing.

107
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:39,825
But why would clay be stuck on the bottom of something like that?

108
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:42,325
Well, well.

109
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:45,625
If things were as always, I would already be off work

110
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:49,325
and humming a tune taking a hot bath by now.

111
00:07:51,825 --> 00:07:53,425
Taking a bath...

112
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:58,425
I see. So, that's the story.

113
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:01,425
The murder weapon didn't disappear at all.

114
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:03,625
The perp took advantage of that

115
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,125
and lifted off the murder weapon.

116
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,525
Out of visual range of the adults.

117
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,225
I got it, Inspector.

118
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:18,725
The perp who killed Mr. Chikafumi Usuda.

119
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:21,625
-What? -Really, Mr. Mouri?

120
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,925
Yes.

121
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:26,825
The perps are the customers who had it out with the victim.

122
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:29,125
Although they seem to have left already,

123
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,525
if they took the poisoned needle

124
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:34,125
that they used for committing the murder with them,

125
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,625
it's only natural that the murder weapon

126
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,425
can't be found inside the shop.

127
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:41,825
Rather, so you may want to think

128
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:43,425
but the fact isn't that way at all.

129
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:46,725
What? What on earth are you talking about?

130
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:49,225
Well, no. What I just said was...

131
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:51,925
It's him, the other me.

132
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:56,025
Detectives usually have another self within themselves

133
00:08:56,025 --> 00:09:00,025
who can objectively analyze their own deductions,

134
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:05,425
but my other self always pops out at the worse time.

135
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:07,725
It seems that the inspector and the others can hear it too,

136
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:10,925
so it may look as if I'm actually saying it.

137
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,725
I really have no sense of doing anything of that sort.

138
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:17,725
I feel like some unidentified thing has taken over my body.

139
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,425
No, no. Rather than that, the problem is

140
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:25,125
the slight pain that runs through my neck after that.

141
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,225
Right, this is it.

142
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:33,625
And that intolerable and irresistible sleepiness that takes over.

143
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:38,625
This is probably the result of my brain cells working to the max.

144
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,525
Hey, Mr. Mouri!

145
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:44,325
I'm starting to like this sleepiness recently.

146
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:45,535
Why?

147
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,340
Mr. Mouri...

148
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,040
Mr. Mouri!

149
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,340
Mr. Mouri, are you awake?

150
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,640
I mean, everybody's gone home already!

151
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,440
What about the case?

152
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
Just what're you talking about?

153
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,140
You just finished the Sleeping Kogoro Deduction Show!

154
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,240
Right. And when I snap back to myself,

155
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,940
the case is solved.

156
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,040
Well, I see through the truth,

157
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,340
and relay it to the authorities.

158
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,340
Since I use up whatever power is left in me,

159
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,340
I don't remember a thing.

160
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,140
So, the perp was the customer who had it out with the victim.

161
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,440
Huh? Didn't you mention that

162
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,840
a customer who just happened to have it out with the victim

163
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,440
couldn't have so conveniently had a poison needle ready?

164
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,240
Then, don't tell me that

165
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,140
the perp was among those three

166
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,840
that work at the same company as the victim.

167
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,240
Huh? Yes.

168
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,440
How could that be?

169
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,840
Because although they had what could be used as murder weapons,

170
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,140
no poison or blood was found on anything!

171
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,440
Are you all right?

172
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,440
I mean, didn't you think it was impossible too, Yuzuki?

173
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,640
What?

174
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,640
So you were just testing

175
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,440
if I really understood your deduction, weren't you?

176
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,140
Yes, sort of.

177
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,740
I was really convinced and I really understood!

178
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,940
I had no idea that

179
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,540
the perp had hidden the murder weapon in that manner.

180
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,440
In that manner?

181
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,840
The experiment you did with Conan's help was great, too!

182
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,240
You asked Officer Takagi to go and buy a film case.

183
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,040
Then after pouring about one-third of it with water,

184
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,240
you shattered the carbonic bath tablets

185
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,540
that you also asked him to buy for you into sugar cube size

186
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,440
and put them in the case.

187
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,140
Then you closed the lid of the film case turned the case upside down,

188
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,940
placing it facing lid down on the table.

189
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,240
Then, in about 2 and a half to 3 minutes...

190
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,940
Like so.

191
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,240
The so-called film case rocket.

192
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,740
The foaming bath tablet causes carbonic acid gas.

193
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,940
The gas the fills up inside the film case,

194
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,540
pushes open the lid of the case like a rocket and flies up high.

195
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,440
The fragrance of yuzu.

196
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,940
Right. The perp must've used

197
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,240
a carbonic bath tablet that smelled of yuzu.

198
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,340
What about the popping sound that I heard 2 or 3 times before?

199
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,140
The perp tried it out several times here.

200
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,440
To test whether the murder weapon

201
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,140
that was placed on top of the film case

202
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,940
would poke into the ceiling of this shop after it was launched.

203
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,540
He put the murder weapon on it?

204
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,640
The murder weapon is an ice pick like item, you know?

205
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,040
Something so heavy could never be placed on it.

206
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,640
The tip of the steel dart is removable,

207
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,540
and weighs approximately 18 grams.

208
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,540
There should be no problem launching it.

209
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,740
Moreover, the perp stuck clay onto the bottom of the case

210
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,240
and fixed the tip of the dart onto it.

211
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,240
A cylindrical poster was also used as a guide as well as to hide it.

212
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,640
This way, even if it were to go slightly off track when launching,

213
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,440
it would reach the ceiling without fail.

214
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,940
Am I wrong in some way?

215
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,740
The one who bought the darts

216
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,640
as a birthday present for the victim...

217
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,440
Mr. Monpei Kogure!

218
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,540
If it were you,

219
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,540
you could have laced the tip of the dart with poison

220
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,940
and put it back into the case.

221
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,640
This trick of using the film case rocket

222
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,640
could only have been set up by you who was near the poster.

223
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,440
Mr. Kogure, probably, after the victim got wasted,

224
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,640
deliberately lost when playing billiards or darts

225
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,940
with the other two to get out of the game.

226
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,040
After being left behind with the victim,

227
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,440
he put on a pretense of covering him with a jacket or something

228
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,640
and poked the poison laced tip of the dart

229
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,340
into the neck of the victim.

230
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,440
After removing the tip of the dart,

231
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,840
he switched it with another dart tip that was prepared beforehand.

232
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,540
The tip laced with poison

233
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,540
was fixed onto the bottom of the film case with clay.

234
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,240
After hiding the murder weapon between his crotch or something,

235
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,140
all he had to do later was distract the other two

236
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,140
and set the film case rocket on the table.

237
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,840
Right, by saying something like

238
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,640
doesn't that customer look like some celebrity?

239
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,440
That is, of course, after he ordered a bottle of champagne.

240
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,940
Come to think of it, back then...

241
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,240
Then how about another one of the first champagne that we drank?

242
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,640
Yes! That was good.

243
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,140
-What do you say? -Fine with me.

244
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,240
Excuse me! A bottle of champagne, please!

245
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,040
-Right away! -And three glasses, too!

246
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,940
That person at the counter, isn't he Kogoro Mouri?

247
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,740
No joke! You mean that renown detective?

248
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,540
I somehow feel like I'm being watched.

249
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,140
I want to take a picture of him!

250
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,740
Maybe he's just a look alike?

251
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,840
I guess so. I don't think he'd be such a drunkard.

252
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,940
And to finish it off, you pulled out the cork of the champagne

253
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,540
almost simultaneous to the sound of the rocket taking off.

254
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,740
What's with this? It's really tight.

255
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,640
Hey! Don't face it this way, you know!

256
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,440
I know.

257
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,640
If you splash the champagne

258
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,640
that bursts forth onto the poster after the launch,

259
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:46,040
you can just wipe off the remains of the carbonic bath tablet.

260
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,040
As proof of this, the wet part of the poster

261
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,540
should smell like yuzu.

262
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,640
True.

263
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,740
But this poster was what Ms. Kishiura had bought, wasn't it?

264
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,040
It seems that the victim repeatedly kept asking for it.

265
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,440
If it turned out that she didn't buy the poster,

266
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,440
he was probably going to prepare another poster anyway.

267
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,240
If he gave the dart board to the victim beforehand,

268
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,540
it's assumable that he would be asking for darts to go with it.

269
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,240
And as for the film cases,

270
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,540
if you know beforehand that he's going to be asking for

271
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,940
a lot of pictures to be taken for his blog,

272
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,740
this is also presumable.

273
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,540
Well, everything will be answered

274
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,840
by that thing poked into the ceiling.

275
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,040
That murder weapon over there.

276
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,240
If it weren't for Mr. Kogure who bought the darts,

277
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,140
it wouldn't be possible to prepare the same tips for the darts.

278
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,440
But if the only thing poked in is the tip of the dart,

279
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,240
the film case with the clay attached to it

280
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,040
should also come falling somewhere, no?

281
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,640
That's true.

282
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,440
But back then, everyone is panicked

283
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,840
because the important poster for the victim is wet with champagne.

284
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,340
Even if it were to have dropped,

285
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,940
it would only look as if he hurriedly wiped the table off.

286
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,840
By the way, the clay on the film case peeled off

287
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,540
from the impact of the case falling to the floor

288
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,340
and I happened to step on it.

289
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,240
And the mirrored image of the alphabets HDPE

290
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,440
were molded on that clay.

291
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,240
Because that's what's usually

292
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,140
indicated on the bottom of film cases.

293
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,540
Then what about the pieces of carbonic bath tablets

294
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,640
that were left on the table?

295
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,440
He probably put it into the beer that he was drinking.

296
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,940
Because foams look natural in beer.

297
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,040
It'll completely dissolve.

298
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,740
Well, his perfect crime

299
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,740
thanks to the Sleeping Kogoro having been here

300
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,640
has indeed vanished like the foams.

301
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,940
I see. What a good line.

302
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,540
You said that yourself, didn't you?

303
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,140
The inspector said that you don't remember a thing

304
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,140
after you solve the case,

305
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,140
but it was really true.

306
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,140
Which means you don't even remember that the motive of the killer

307
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,940
was to avenge the death of his colleague who committed suicide

308
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,340
because of terrible power harassment from the department head?

309
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,040
Is that right? Nothing what so ever.

310
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,340
Gosh, you were really awesome, and yet...

311
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,340
No, hold it.

312
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,740
It's not possible that I don't remember a thing.

313
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,740
Don't tell me that the one I thought was the other me

314
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,440
was the one who is subconsciously asleep in me.

315
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,640
"The real Kogoro Mouri" -The real me!

316
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
I see!

317
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,140
I normally save energy and accumulate my powers to be used

318
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,440
when I become the Sleeping Kogoro!

319
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,740
Either way, it's me all the same,

320
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,540
so everything's okay!

321
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,540
And about Conan, I wonder if he's okay?

322
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,040
Come to think of it, that glasses kid...

323
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,140
Did he leave me here and head home or what?

324
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,140
Yes. After talking to Officer Takagi,

325
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,740
he went pale and dashed out of here.

326
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,840
I wonder what they were talking about?

327
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,040
I think I heard something about a pick-pocket.

328
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
He probably heard from Officer Takagi

329
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,240
that a TV program that he's been wanting to watch

330
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,840
was going to be aired tonight and fled home!

331
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
What? Why?

332
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,840
Because it's a thrilling pick-pocket movie.

333
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,740
Just kidding!

334
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,140
I've outdone myself again!

335
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,140
Something's strange about the victim who was pick-pocketed?

336
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,640
Yes. Do you remember?

337
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,340
The guy called Tohei Benzaki, one of the victims back then.

338
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,640
Yes. The person who became hostage together with Jodie

339
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,240
when the bank robbery occurred, right?

340
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,340
That's right.

341
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,840
Jodie said that his wife who came later back then,

342
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,440
taped her eyes and mouth with masking tape, didn't she?

343
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,940
However, it seems that the bank robber

344
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,240
made people who didn't have anybody accompanying them do the work.

345
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Because the robber figured

346
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,640
that family members would be lenient with each other.

347
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,140
Okay, those with nobody accompanying you!

348
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,140
Stand where you are!

349
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,840
You guys come here to get the masking tape!

350
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,240
Cover the eyes, mouth and immobilize the hands

351
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,040
of those who didn't come alone with the masking tape!

352
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,340
Unless, you really don't know each other,

353
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,740
you may be lenient, you see!

354
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,340
There!

355
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,840
Of course, we'll be taking care of you guys later too!

356
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,040
Hey.

357
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,240
Excuse me, I'm going to tape you.

358
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:26,240
If her husband Tohei was also a hostage of that crime back then,

359
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,240
it doesn't fall into place.

360
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,640
A pregnant lady would never take the risk of deliberately

361
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,740
going out of her way to cheat a bank robber.

362
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,640
And? Did you try contacting the couple?

363
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,740
Yes.

364
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,040
I went to his residence many times

365
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,340
but he denied any involvement saying,

366
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:51,540
"I've never been involved in any pick-pocket murder."

367
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,840
Moreover, that Mr. Benzaki is single and doesn't have a wife.

368
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,040
Much less, he says he doesn't know of any pregnant lady.

369
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,240
I really have no idea what's going on.

370
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
Don't tell me...

371
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,040
It can't be...

372
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,540
Morning sickness is the early symptoms of pregnancy, right?

373
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,740
Right. I have bad eyesight.

374
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,240
Then, the guy with the burn on his face

375
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,940
who was next to me back then was your boyfriend or something.

376
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,040
I saw him about 2 or 3 days ago.

377
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,240
Don't tell me...

378
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,340
Don't tell me...

379
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,540
"Next Episode" -Cool it. I'll be fine.

380
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,440
I'm still okay.

381
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,840
And just the two of you. Ran and you.

382
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,740
This is the place to show your true self.

383
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,740
So, all three can commit the crime.

384
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,140
No.

385
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,540
