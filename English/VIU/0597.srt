1
00:00:02,516 --> 00:00:06,016
There's flood above and a big fire below.

2
00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:07,816
What's this?

3
00:00:07,816 --> 00:00:09,316
Hot spring!

4
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:11,116
Right!

5
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:12,716
The answer is bathtub, right?

6
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:14,716
Because you don't boil the water of a hot spring.

7
00:00:14,716 --> 00:00:18,216
Well, I don't think they're all that wrong.

8
00:00:18,216 --> 00:00:19,916
Because most hot springs are warmed

9
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:23,516
by the heat of burning magma.

10
00:00:23,516 --> 00:00:26,216
Well, that's true.

11
00:00:26,216 --> 00:00:28,816
But, I wonder what's going on?

12
00:00:28,816 --> 00:00:31,816
Why would Dr. Agasa want to take us to a hot spring?

13
00:00:31,816 --> 00:00:33,916
I'm going over to repair my invention.

14
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,716
The owner of this inn really liked it

15
00:00:36,716 --> 00:00:40,816
and bought a whole lot from me.

16
00:00:40,816 --> 00:00:44,016
It seems that the guests favored them too,

17
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:46,216
but it seem to have broken down recently.

18
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:47,916
What kind of thing did you make?

19
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,116
A chair that makes you feel like you took

20
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,616
a hot spring bath just by sitting in it,

21
00:00:51,616 --> 00:00:53,616
as well as the good effects of the hot spring working on your body?

22
00:00:53,616 --> 00:00:54,816
Amazing!

23
00:00:54,816 --> 00:00:57,816
With something like that you don't need hot springs.

24
00:00:57,816 --> 00:01:00,216
Well, I'll keep you in suspense.

25
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:05,216
Well, I'm sure it's one of his not useful inventions again.

26
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:28,916
Brooding over passing seasons

27
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,916
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

28
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,616
An open-air bath afloat on the lake.

29
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:34,716
The locked room mystery before dawn.

30
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:36,316
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:38,016
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:40,216
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,779
"Yukemuri Locked Room Scenario (Part 1)"

34
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,279
"Hakone Hot Spring Kobo Inn"

35
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:31,775
The water temperature now is 42.3 ～C.

36
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:34,975
The total sulfur content per kg of water

37
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:37,675
is 25.7 ml.

38
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:41,475
This hot spring is a sulfur spring.

39
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:43,075
It's cute.

40
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:46,675
It's effective for skin disease, arteriosclerosis,

41
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:48,575
-beautiful skin and rheumatism -What kind of doll is it?

42
00:03:48,575 --> 00:03:51,075
-as well as neuralgia... -It's a Goemon Ishikawa doll!

43
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:54,175
When it comes to baths it's Goemon Ishikawa, right?

44
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:56,975
Wasn't he was boiled in an iron pot and executed?

45
00:03:56,975 --> 00:04:00,075
If ingested it may also have medicinal effects

46
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:03,875
against... diabetes...

47
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,175
gout...

48
00:04:05,175 --> 00:04:11,275
constipation...

49
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:20,075
Goemon is totally steamed up.

50
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:22,175
It seems that the moving part wore out

51
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:24,475
and water leaked inside.

52
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:26,675
Can you fix it overnight?

53
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:29,975
Yes, since I brought the parts necessary.

54
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:32,175
This time I'll make them more sturdy and durable.

55
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:33,475
Hey.

56
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,375
You're not finished cleaning yet?

57
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,975
It's already after 1 pm.

58
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:39,775
In about another 10 minutes.

59
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:42,975
I tell you! I wanted to try bathing in all five spas

60
00:04:42,975 --> 00:04:45,175
here before I shoot the film, and yet...

61
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:47,275
Well, you can take a bath

62
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:48,575
even after we finish the shoot.

63
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:54,375
Aren't you actress Ms. Mishio Natori?

64
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,375
Yes, I am.

65
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,475
Just as I thought!

66
00:04:57,475 --> 00:04:58,975
You played the role of the lover

67
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:01,575
of the very first Masked Yaiba, right?

68
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:03,875
You were very cute.

69
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:07,875
You were always kind to everybody.

70
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,975
"Mishio Natori (28)" -I guess I did play a stupid role

71
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:12,975
like that some time in the past.

72
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:15,275
But, that's a story of the past.

73
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:17,775
I wish you wouldn't remind me of it.

74
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,975
She somehow seems different from before.

75
00:05:19,975 --> 00:05:21,875
She used to always be smiling.

76
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,675
Is she a snob?

77
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:26,275
Sorry, kids.

78
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:28,775
She's just concentrating on her role now

79
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:30,675
and is a bit annoyed.

80
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:32,575
"Junsaku Tanzawa (34)" -Even I, as manager

81
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:35,175
find it hard to talk to her.

82
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:38,275
A role? Are you filming a drama or something here?

83
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:41,675
She did say something about filming a while ago.

84
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,075
Actually...

85
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:46,575
It's a movie that'll be released next year.

86
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:48,375
A supreme masterpiece

87
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,075
of the Bloody Smoke Hitman series.

88
00:05:50,075 --> 00:05:52,375
"Ganji Tetsuyama (67)" -Titled Scarlet Wellspring!

89
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,875
Of course the scriptwriter is,

90
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,975
yours truly, Ganji Tetsuyama.

91
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,775
I guess you brats don't know me.

92
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,375
I know, I know.

93
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:07,375
You're finally going to remake Scarlet Wellspring!

94
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,775
What's that? Blood Smoke Hitman?

95
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:12,875
A story about a professional killer.

96
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,775
It is said that he got his name because for some reason,

97
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,475
he was asked to do work in the spa district,

98
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:20,675
and because steam is smeared with blood, people called him by that name.

99
00:06:20,675 --> 00:06:24,175
This series is that old man's debut work.

100
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,875
It is a story that is separated into the young life edition

101
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,875
and elderly life edition of the main character,

102
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,775
who is the killer and Scarlet Wellspring is the only title

103
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:35,575
that belongs to the midlife part.

104
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:37,275
If I remember...

105
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:39,575
the main character quit being a hitman

106
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:41,975
due to a certain incident

107
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:44,075
but, decided to kill for free for the first time

108
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:46,575
for a woman owner of an inn.

109
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:49,475
He schemes up a perfect locked room murder...

110
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,775
I think it was.

111
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:52,675
And, the midlife part,

112
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:55,475
Scarlet Wellspring was filmed just once

113
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:57,975
in black and white quite some time ago,

114
00:06:57,975 --> 00:07:00,375
but it was never remade because they couldn't find an actor

115
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,775
that was suitable to be the main character.

116
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:04,975
The youth edition and elderly edition

117
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:06,875
were acted out by various actors

118
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,275
and remade over and over by many directors though.

119
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:13,075
And...

120
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:16,175
"Unpei Terado (33)" -I, the perfect image of the

121
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:18,275
middle aged hitman appeared.

122
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:21,175
You're here too, Mr. Terado.

123
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:25,275
Yes. I heard the heroine already arrived on site,

124
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:28,675
so I ditched the manager and flew over.

125
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:31,475
Before the film staff arrives tomorrow...

126
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:32,975
If only a little bit, I was thinking of becoming intimate

127
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:34,875
with the beautiful heroine.

128
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:41,775
I won't have you doing things to our actress without permission.

129
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:43,775
Besides the role you're playing

130
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:46,875
is that of a grief-stricken middle-aged man,

131
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,875
exhausted by the business of killing.

132
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:52,875
Not that of a skirt-chasing pervert with undisguised lust, right?

133
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,175
Yeah, I know.

134
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,575
That it's a completely different story

135
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:58,675
from the pompous showoff you

136
00:07:58,675 --> 00:08:00,775
played in the youth edition.

137
00:08:00,775 --> 00:08:02,575
I see.

138
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:05,275
I thought you looked familiar.

139
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:08,175
You're the actor, Mr. Junsaku Tanzawa!

140
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:10,275
Yes.

141
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:13,275
You were great as the hitman.

142
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:16,375
You should do the midlife edition too!

143
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,975
Hey, hey...

144
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:22,375
No. I've taken a break from acting for personal reasons.

145
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,775
But you could be dragged back into acting again.

146
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:28,475
Being that the cast could be completely changed

147
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:31,275
on a whim by our great scriptwriter here.

148
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:34,275
Yes, true.

149
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:37,775
I already have two or three actors in mind as your substitute.

150
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:40,575
Depending on your performance a change could occur.

151
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:42,075
What?

152
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:45,275
Of course, that goes for you too, Ms. Natori.

153
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,675
I'm not surprised.

154
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:49,475
Well... Take a slow nice bath in the spa.

155
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:51,575
Cleanse your body well, and perform your role

156
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:54,075
as the woman owner of the inn as best you can.

157
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,775
There is a romantic sexy "wet" scene too, you know!

158
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:00,875
What's a "wet" scene?

159
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,875
What?

160
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,975
I think she's going to take a bath?

161
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:07,475
I see, if so, she'll get wet.

162
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:10,075
Well, I guess I'll leave it at that.

163
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:18,375
Is something wrong with his leg?

164
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,775
Yes. He seems to have injured his tendon

165
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:22,575
a few years ago.

166
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:24,775
He's been walking that way ever since,

167
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:27,975
according to a documentary TV program.

168
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:30,075
Now that we've come all this way,

169
00:09:30,075 --> 00:09:32,675
we should try the specialty of this hot spring inn

170
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:35,475
and take a dip in the open-air bath on the lake, okay?

171
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,175
What's that?

172
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:38,775
Literally, an open-air spa

173
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:42,575
with a great scenic view built on a lake!

174
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:46,075
They only have it here, and at the Hawaii Hot Spring in Tottori!

175
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:49,575
Awesome!

176
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:53,075
But, why is the women's bath bigger?

177
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:55,075
It seems they switch the men and women's

178
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:57,175
bath after the cleaning at noon.

179
00:09:57,175 --> 00:09:58,375
See you!

180
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,375
Okay!

181
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,575
See you later!

182
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,775
It looks crowded.

183
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,975
The women's side is filled too.

184
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:13,375
It can't be helped.

185
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,975
Let's come back first thing in the morning.

186
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:18,575
In the morning the men's bath is larger.

187
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:22,275
And it'll be nice taking a dip while watching the sunrise.

188
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:23,975
-Okay! -I guess so!

189
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:27,575
It's no wonder it's cold,

190
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:29,575
since we're atop of the lake exposed to the wind.

191
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:31,675
Let's hurry back to the room.

192
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:40,275
So you've finally decided to do it.

193
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:42,175
The open-air bath on the lake

194
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,475
with the morning sun shining down.

195
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:47,975
Sounds great, just great.

196
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:49,575
The man playing the lead role?

197
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:51,075
If you don't care for him,

198
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:52,575
we could make a switch.

199
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:08,875
What's wrong, Mishio?

200
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,575
I think I heard something crack.

201
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:14,075
Is anything wrong?

202
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:15,375
It's nothing!

203
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,675
Leave me alone!

204
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:33,975
Why me?

205
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:36,075
It's the manager we saw yesterday.

206
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,375
You're an early bird, aren't you?

207
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,375
It' still 4:30 am.

208
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,975
Bug you, brat.

209
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:53,475
I'm back.

210
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:55,475
What took you so long, Conan?

211
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:58,575
How long is it going to take you to buy drinks?

212
00:11:58,575 --> 00:12:01,375
It's because you made me go buy the drinks all alone.

213
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,675
And, telling me to buy different kinds too.

214
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:07,175
It's your fault for being weak at playing stone, paper, scissors.

215
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:08,975
The man who was smoking the pipe yesterday

216
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:10,675
is already heading for the bath.

217
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:12,575
-What? -See, over there.

218
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:15,375
He's crossing the wharf.

219
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,875
It's supposed to start at 5 am in the morning, right?

220
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,175
It's 4:43 am right now.

221
00:12:20,175 --> 00:12:22,175
It's a violation.

222
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,875
Let's go too.

223
00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:29,075
I guess we'll let Dr. Agasa sleep.

224
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:32,175
I guess so. Since he was repairing until late last night too.

225
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,175
What?

226
00:12:35,175 --> 00:12:38,375
How come that gramps get to go and we don't?

227
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,475
Well, that man is an honored guest

228
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:43,175
so he gets special privileges.

229
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:47,575
But, it's only 10 more minutes to 5 am.

230
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:50,275
Right. I guess we can let them in.

231
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:52,175
All right!

232
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:54,875
Hey! Running is dangerous!

233
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:02,675
It's been three days since I last took a bath.

234
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:06,875
Wash your body clean before going into the tub.

235
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:07,975
Understood.

236
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:15,275
The clothes of that old man is nowhere in sight.

237
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,875
What's the matter, Ayumi?

238
00:13:32,075 --> 00:13:34,275
Don't tell me that something happened inside?

239
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:35,775
Not you guys!

240
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:36,775
What?

241
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,475
What?

242
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:41,375
Why...

243
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,775
is that old man in the women's bath?

244
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:46,375
Is it an accident?

245
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,775
No. This is homicide.

246
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:52,075
Moreover...

247
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:53,575
A locked room murder!

248
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:03,393
Is something wrong?

249
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:04,893
How should I know.

250
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:07,893
I came to take a bath at this open-air stall on the lake,

251
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:10,293
but those children won't let me through.

252
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:13,293
That's because we were told not to let anyone through.

253
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:15,693
By Conan.

254
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:19,393
Hey, is he dead?

255
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:20,993
Yes.

256
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,193
He's not breathing.

257
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:24,193
No way.

258
00:14:24,193 --> 00:14:27,393
You called the police, didn't you?

259
00:14:27,393 --> 00:14:28,393
Yes.

260
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:32,793
Mr. Tetsuyama.

261
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:34,393
Why is he...

262
00:14:34,393 --> 00:14:36,193
-Mr. Tetsuyama! -Don't touch!

263
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:38,193
Mr. Tetsuyama!

264
00:14:40,093 --> 00:14:42,193
The cause of death is acute subdural hematoma

265
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:43,993
due to a violent blow on the back of the head

266
00:14:43,993 --> 00:14:46,093
in addition to cerebral contusion.

267
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,493
The estimated time of death

268
00:14:47,493 --> 00:14:49,293
is around 5 am this morning.

269
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:52,493
The lather on the sole of the victim's feet

270
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:55,993
and the residue of lather on the tile at his feet.

271
00:14:55,993 --> 00:14:58,493
In addition, judging from the bar of soap

272
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:01,793
on the other side of his feet.

273
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:03,093
It seems to have flown there...

274
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:04,193
He seems to have accidentally stepped

275
00:15:04,193 --> 00:15:05,993
on it when coming out of the tub,

276
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:07,493
slipped and fell.

277
00:15:07,493 --> 00:15:10,993
Then hit his head on the rocks around the tub.

278
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,893
I guess it's safe to say that this is an accidental death.

279
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:16,293
But, isn't it strange?

280
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:18,093
This is the women's bath, you know?

281
00:15:18,093 --> 00:15:20,593
This brat again.

282
00:15:20,593 --> 00:15:23,393
I thought it strange too, but...

283
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:25,693
This old man headed for the open-air bath

284
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,693
at a little after 4:30 am,

285
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,593
and the surroundings was still dark,

286
00:15:29,593 --> 00:15:32,493
so he just probably just mistook the women's bath for the men's.

287
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:37,193
We came here after this old man came here too

288
00:15:37,193 --> 00:15:39,693
but we could clearly read the character

289
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:42,093
on the curtain as being women or men.

290
00:15:42,093 --> 00:15:44,993
Then, you met them too, didn't you?

291
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:46,993
The two employees who were at the entrance

292
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,593
going from the main building to the wharf.

293
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:51,793
Those two said that the only one

294
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:53,293
who passed the entrance

295
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:56,093
before you children came was

296
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:58,893
this old man.

297
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:01,693
If you're the ones who came after the old man,

298
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:03,093
and found his dead body,

299
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:05,393
what else could it be but an accident?

300
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:07,393
But, take a look

301
00:16:07,393 --> 00:16:10,593
at the collarbone of the old man.

302
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:12,193
There's a pool of water there.

303
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:15,593
See, by his belly button too

304
00:16:15,593 --> 00:16:16,993
Right.

305
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:20,593
If he fell hard enough to die from hitting his head,

306
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:22,193
then any water that was left

307
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:23,693
on his body would've flown off, right?

308
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:25,193
True.

309
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:28,393
Maybe after the old man fell down somebody

310
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:32,393
splashed water on him and tried to wash something off.

311
00:16:32,393 --> 00:16:35,293
Wash off... what?

312
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:38,593
I see, blood!

313
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:40,993
The unnatural spray of blood that splattered on his shoulders and back,

314
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:42,693
when he was initially struck.

315
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:43,893
After hitting his head against the rock

316
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:45,593
by the spa in order to finish him off,

317
00:16:45,593 --> 00:16:47,093
the killer washed the blood off

318
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:51,093
to make it look like an accident.

319
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,693
Hey, hold it!

320
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:54,693
When you found the body,

321
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:57,193
there was no one else here except for you,

322
00:16:57,193 --> 00:16:59,093
kids, was there?

323
00:16:59,093 --> 00:17:00,093
No.

324
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:01,893
I didn't hear a loud sound like somebody

325
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:04,393
jumped into the lake either.

326
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:09,093
Which means that this outdoor spa on the lake...

327
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:11,293
is completely sealed off!

328
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:15,293
An impossible crime, right?

329
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:17,793
That's why we have to solve that mystery first.

330
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:20,193
Yeah, that's right.

331
00:17:20,193 --> 00:17:21,293
Hey!

332
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:24,293
Don't spout off pretending to be a police detective, you brat!

333
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,493
Hey! Call the forensics back here!

334
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:29,993
We're going to thoroughly re-investigate this case again!

335
00:17:29,993 --> 00:17:31,393
Yes, sir!

336
00:17:31,393 --> 00:17:32,993
That hurt.

337
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:35,693
And, Conan...

338
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:36,993
How was it?

339
00:17:36,993 --> 00:17:38,693
You saw, didn't you?

340
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:39,893
See what?

341
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,993
You know... "that", "that".

342
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:45,393
Ayumi screamed really loud, right?

343
00:17:45,393 --> 00:17:46,793
Yeah, I saw.

344
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:47,893
I thought so...

345
00:17:47,893 --> 00:17:49,093
You saw?

346
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:50,793
Yeah, I sure did.

347
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:52,293
It's natural because after all,

348
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:53,593
everybody comes here to take a bath.

349
00:17:53,593 --> 00:17:56,093
Totally naked and exposed.

350
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:58,293
Naked and...

351
00:17:58,293 --> 00:17:59,593
Exposed?

352
00:17:59,593 --> 00:18:00,893
How dare you!

353
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:03,193
Conan, you dumb, dumb!

354
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:04,293
What?

355
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,093
You guys saw too, didn't you?

356
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:07,393
The dead body of the old man.

357
00:18:07,393 --> 00:18:08,693
What?

358
00:18:08,693 --> 00:18:10,293
Just what are you guys talking about?

359
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:13,193
So... if it's the dead body of that old man,

360
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,093
we saw him too.

361
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,593
Just a little bit after the police came.

362
00:18:17,593 --> 00:18:22,093
No way. You guys didn't come inside.

363
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:23,693
We saw from outside!

364
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:25,593
What?

365
00:18:25,593 --> 00:18:29,293
You see, we went pass this corridor

366
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:32,293
and slipped by beside the outdoor ventilator of the ventilation fan

367
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:35,393
then climbed over this fence.

368
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:37,493
See, you can see, can't you?

369
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:43,993
Hey, you brats, where the heck did you...

370
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:47,293
The veranda here is connected to the corridor outside.

371
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:49,893
What?

372
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:51,393
Moreover, taking into consideration

373
00:18:51,393 --> 00:18:53,793
this glass window has no lock.

374
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:55,193
I see.

375
00:18:55,193 --> 00:18:57,393
If the culprit hid in a blind spot of the corridor

376
00:18:57,393 --> 00:19:02,193
before the outdoor spa closed the night before at 11 pm,

377
00:19:02,193 --> 00:19:05,493
after he killed the old man who came along early in the morning,

378
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:07,593
he could've gone through the corridor

379
00:19:07,593 --> 00:19:11,293
from the veranda and mingled within the crowd

380
00:19:11,293 --> 00:19:12,593
that couldn't make it inside.

381
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:13,993
That's right.

382
00:19:13,993 --> 00:19:16,893
Why not start by picking out guests

383
00:19:16,893 --> 00:19:19,693
who came here to the outdoor spa on the lake alone,

384
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:22,693
without telling anyone?

385
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:25,193
The killer could be among those guests.

386
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:26,993
Yes.

387
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:35,493
So, the ones who came to this outdoor spa alone without telling anyone

388
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:37,493
turned out to be only you three,

389
00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:41,993
who happened to be connected with the late Mr. Ganji Tetsuyama.

390
00:19:41,993 --> 00:19:45,593
Well, the rest of the guests were mostly family

391
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:49,093
and the only ones who stayed over alone

392
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:50,993
were Mr. Tetsuyama and you people.

393
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:53,893
While taking out your personal belongings

394
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,493
tell me where and what you were doing at around 5 am,

395
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:59,793
the estimated time of his death?

396
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:02,193
Let's start with the heroine of the movie

397
00:20:02,193 --> 00:20:04,793
that Mr. Tetsuyama wrote the script for,

398
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:07,293
Ms. Mishio Natori.

399
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:09,293
I don't know what you're trying to get at

400
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:10,893
but the only things I have with me

401
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:14,193
is this pouch with make-up inside and a towel.

402
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:16,593
My room key is at the front desk.

403
00:20:16,593 --> 00:20:19,093
I was told to leave it with the front desk

404
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,093
before going to the outdoor spa.

405
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:24,293
I just got up at about 5 am.

406
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:26,593
And I came here at about 5 am

407
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:27,893
because I was told that I could take a bath

408
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,993
while watching the sunrise.

409
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:33,293
I like hot springs.

410
00:20:33,293 --> 00:20:35,993
And, your relationship with Mr. Tetsuyama,

411
00:20:35,993 --> 00:20:39,293
was it just one between a scriptwriter and an actress?

412
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:41,693
-Yes. -Don't lie.

413
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:46,093
It seemed Mr. Tetsuyama was making passes at you.

414
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:47,893
There's rumor going around

415
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:51,893
that you got the heroine part this time by becoming the great his lover.

416
00:20:51,893 --> 00:20:55,093
What? I got the part because of my acting expertise!

417
00:20:55,093 --> 00:20:57,893
I'm not you, who had to beg for a role

418
00:20:57,893 --> 00:21:00,293
to get to become a candidate for the starring role.

419
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:04,093
Candidate? It's been decided that I play the leading part!

420
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:08,793
And? Lead actor, where and what were you doing at around 5 am?

421
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:11,093
I was sleeping at that time.

422
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:14,793
I came here to take a bath at a little before 6 am.

423
00:21:14,793 --> 00:21:16,693
The only things I have on me are a towel,

424
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:19,393
cigarettes and my room key.

425
00:21:19,393 --> 00:21:22,493
Didn't you leave your room key at the front desk?

426
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:24,493
Too much hassle.

427
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:25,793
I also brought my key along with me

428
00:21:25,793 --> 00:21:28,093
instead of leaving it at the front desk.

429
00:21:28,093 --> 00:21:29,793
Because I just went to look for her,

430
00:21:29,793 --> 00:21:32,693
since she didn't return to her room for quite some time.

431
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:37,193
So, all I have with me are my room key, wallet and cell phone.

432
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:40,393
At around 5 am I was watching TV in my room.

433
00:21:40,393 --> 00:21:43,093
Watching TV at 5 am. You're an early riser.

434
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,393
Yes.

435
00:21:44,393 --> 00:21:46,593
I was actually up at about a little pass 4 am.

436
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:47,893
And I went to the front desk around 4:30 am

437
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:49,893
to get some loose change.

438
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:53,393
Did you need the loose change to buy canned coffee?

439
00:21:55,593 --> 00:21:56,893
You're an early bird, aren't you?

440
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:58,893
It' still 4:30 am.

441
00:21:58,893 --> 00:22:00,493
Bug you, brat.

442
00:22:02,193 --> 00:22:05,093
I saw you at around 4:30 am in front of the vending machine, right?

443
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:06,593
Yes.

444
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:09,593
Which means Manager Tanzawa,

445
00:22:09,593 --> 00:22:14,193
you couldn't have hidden yourself here all night to ambush

446
00:22:14,193 --> 00:22:15,993
and murder Mr. Tetsuyama.

447
00:22:15,993 --> 00:22:17,793
Murder...

448
00:22:17,793 --> 00:22:19,493
Wasn't it an accident?

449
00:22:19,493 --> 00:22:21,093
Are you serious?

450
00:22:21,093 --> 00:22:25,393
Yes. Although I can't say for sure yet.

451
00:22:26,893 --> 00:22:29,493
The killer is among the three.

452
00:22:33,493 --> 00:22:36,993
The one who killed Mr. Tetsuyama.

453
00:23:58,593 --> 00:24:00,693
If so, the culprit is...

454
00:24:00,693 --> 00:24:02,593
the woman right here!

455
00:24:03,993 --> 00:24:06,493
The culprit got too absorbed in his role,

456
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:08,393
and forgot completely

457
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:11,093
that he had hidden the conclusive evidence

458
00:24:11,093 --> 00:24:14,293
inside his own pocket.

459
00:24:14,293 --> 00:24:17,693
The killer is here...

460
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:19,993
right in front of my eyes.

461
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:23,893
Next Conan,

462
00:24:23,893 --> 00:24:27,793
"Yukemuri Locked Room Scenario (Part 2)"

463
00:24:43,693 --> 00:24:45,993
Next Conan's Hint:

464
00:24:45,993 --> 00:24:47,693
"Ring".

465
00:24:47,693 --> 00:24:49,893
Look after your rear end next week.

466
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:50,993
Just what do you mean?
