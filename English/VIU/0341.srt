1
00:00:01,906 --> 00:00:03,805
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,806 --> 00:00:05,805
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,505
The true killer is found together with a secret cassette tape.

4
00:00:07,506 --> 00:00:09,405
A message that sways Ai's heart.

5
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:11,005
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:12,905
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:15,006
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:59,786
"The Secret Hidden in the Toilet (Part 2)"

9
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:05,785
The burglary that happened after my older sister visited here

10
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:07,285
was most likely done by those people.

11
00:02:07,286 --> 00:02:08,885
Yeah.

12
00:02:08,886 --> 00:02:12,085
They probably guessed that she may have hidden something here

13
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:14,085
and came to look for it.

14
00:02:14,086 --> 00:02:15,985
There were traces of them having set up

15
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:17,686
wiretaps in the toilet too.

16
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:20,685
It's most likely that they couldn't find it

17
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:22,285
when they broke in here the first time,

18
00:02:22,286 --> 00:02:24,585
and so they set up a wiretap.

19
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:26,885
But after hearing that the people here

20
00:02:26,886 --> 00:02:29,685
knew nothing of something being hidden,

21
00:02:29,686 --> 00:02:31,685
they probably broke in here a second time

22
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:34,885
to remove the wiretap.

23
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:38,185
But I think it has nothing to do with this case.

24
00:02:38,186 --> 00:02:39,685
President Dejima may be your father's friend

25
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:43,685
and your father may have been a member of the Black Organization,

26
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:46,085
but they haven't met for 30 years.

27
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:48,185
What if it's me that they're after?

28
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:50,185
They killed my father's friend

29
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:52,985
to mentally corner me.

30
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:53,986
Then what?

31
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:55,985
Don't be silly!

32
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:58,485
How could they ever find out something like that?

33
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:00,585
I could feel it.

34
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:02,385
The day when we went to that department store

35
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:04,085
in Haido-cho,

36
00:03:04,086 --> 00:03:06,785
I could feel that callous glare on me

37
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:11,185
as I went unconscious.

38
00:03:11,186 --> 00:03:12,585
What?

39
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:14,485
Then why did you come here?

40
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,985
Why did you do this if you knew you'd be in danger?

41
00:03:16,986 --> 00:03:18,685
I wanted to know.

42
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:20,585
Is that reason good enough?

43
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:22,285
I wanted to know whether my parents

44
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:26,585
were really the kind of people the organization rumored them to be.

45
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:29,685
After meeting your cheerful mother,

46
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:31,385
I had this urge of wanting to do so.

47
00:03:31,386 --> 00:03:36,285
But leaving aside my mad scientist father,

48
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:38,585
it seems that my mother was reticent, somber,

49
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:41,585
and hard to understand as rumor has it.

50
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:43,185
Don't be silly.

51
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:44,885
It's just rumor, isn't it?

52
00:03:44,886 --> 00:03:47,685
Don't make conclusions without seeing it for yourself.

53
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,185
Do you know

54
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:52,186
what my mother was referred to as in the organization?

55
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:54,386
Hell Angel.

56
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:57,686
An angel who has fallen to hell.

57
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:02,685
Well, now I'm totally uninterested in her

58
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:04,286
and feel sort of relieved.

59
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:08,285
Now that I've finished all I have to do here,

60
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:09,985
let's leave the homicide case to the police

61
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:12,186
and get out of here quickly.

62
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:16,485
I'm not even sure if we have any place

63
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:19,186
to run to at this point though.

64
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:24,985
But unless we find what your older sister had hidden...

65
00:04:24,986 --> 00:04:29,085
He made a deduction a while ago regarding the wiretap.

66
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:31,085
It could be that after hearing

67
00:04:31,086 --> 00:04:32,485
the conversation of the employees here,

68
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:34,585
they specified the place the object was hidden,

69
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:36,485
broke in here a second time,

70
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:38,485
found what they were looking for and retrieved the wiretap

71
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,885
while they were at it too.

72
00:04:39,886 --> 00:04:42,385
Right?

73
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:45,386
That's why there's no reason we should stay here any longer.

74
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,885
So you were burglarized,

75
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:51,485
but nothing was stolen?

76
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:52,486
No.

77
00:04:52,487 --> 00:04:53,985
"Isamu Natsuhori (35)" -But it seemed that the president.

78
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:56,685
"Designer" -thought that his design was stolen.

79
00:04:56,686 --> 00:04:57,785
"Tetsuo Imai (52)" -He insisted someone.

80
00:04:57,786 --> 00:05:00,685
"Designer" -had secretly taken a picture of his design.

81
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:03,585
The president was always nervous about things like that.

82
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:05,985
He would lose his temper every time he saw

83
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:07,685
a design that was similar to his.

84
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:09,985
He went to shout his mouth off this morning too.

85
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:11,185
This morning?

86
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,186
"Ukihiko Zaitsu (41)" -Yes.

87
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,885
"Designer" -To another design office.

88
00:05:13,886 --> 00:05:16,185
He went to tell them off for stealing his design,

89
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:18,686
and he accused them of the burglary some time ago.

90
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,585
Don't tell me that...

91
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:24,885
Yes, it's possible that when he went to that design studio,

92
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:28,585
someone managed to get him in contact with the poison.

93
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:31,785
Well, I don't blame the president for being angry though.

94
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:34,085
If his design was copied and news began spreading,

95
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:37,285
people would get bored and it'd be disposed of in no time.

96
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:38,386
Disposed of?

97
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:43,785
Oh, yes. A strange thing happened after the burglary.

98
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:45,485
A strange thing?

99
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:47,285
A pen that was lost a long time ago

100
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:49,685
suddenly appeared again.

101
00:05:49,686 --> 00:05:51,085
Right, right!

102
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:53,186
Together with my ruler.

103
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:57,485
So it was not stolen, and it suddenly reappeared?

104
00:05:57,486 --> 00:06:01,885
Yes. I just found it on the shoe cabinet near the front door.

105
00:06:01,886 --> 00:06:05,185
But wasn't that before the burglary?

106
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:06,285
What?

107
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:07,885
Was it?

108
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:11,186
But what was even stranger after that was the president.

109
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:14,285
Yeah. Now that you mentioned it,

110
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:16,585
it started around that time, didn't it?

111
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:19,085
He kept going around saying we should save water.

112
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:21,585
He started nagging us to save water.

113
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:25,785
So, we had to stop taking showers during work.

114
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,985
He wasn't the type to be worried about something like that.

115
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:29,785
And yet...

116
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:31,385
I see.

117
00:06:31,386 --> 00:06:33,585
So that's what it was.

118
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:37,886
Could you take us to the design office then?

119
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:40,585
Yes, sir.

120
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:42,386
Something isn't right after all.

121
00:06:44,586 --> 00:06:48,985
This case has nothing to do with the men in black.

122
00:06:48,986 --> 00:06:53,185
The killer is probably that man.

123
00:06:53,186 --> 00:06:54,885
He used the toilet to his advantage

124
00:06:54,886 --> 00:06:57,385
to kill President Dejima.

125
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:59,385
And why should we leave when the treasure

126
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,885
is right before our eyes?

127
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:03,285
Then...

128
00:07:03,286 --> 00:07:09,185
Yeah, it should still be in that toilet.

129
00:07:09,186 --> 00:07:12,386
The thing that your sister hid in there.

130
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:18,985
Inspector! Let's go to the design office.

131
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:20,585
Yeah.

132
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:22,585
Maybe we can find out

133
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:25,085
how the poison was put on President Dejima

134
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:26,585
without being noticed by anybody.

135
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:28,386
No, you'll find nothing.

136
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:30,786
Well, you see...

137
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:37,085
Even if there were something with poison on it,

138
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:40,285
wouldn't he have touched something as soon as he came back here?

139
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:43,385
For example, the doorknob or the back of the chair.

140
00:07:43,386 --> 00:07:47,085
But the poison was detected only on the president's left hand,

141
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:50,885
the right side of his slacks, the belt holes of his belt,

142
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:53,385
the handkerchief that he had

143
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:55,285
and the wrapper of the hamburger

144
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:58,585
that he took a bite of just before he collapsed.

145
00:07:58,586 --> 00:08:01,985
Besides, the poison was of a very small amount.

146
00:08:01,986 --> 00:08:04,385
He must've touched the poison beforehand

147
00:08:04,386 --> 00:08:07,685
for it to rub off on those spots.

148
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,885
You can already make it out, can't you?

149
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:12,886
Where did the poison got onto the president's hand?

150
00:08:13,986 --> 00:08:15,985
The place where you loosen your belt,

151
00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:18,085
pull your slacks up and down,

152
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:20,786
and the place where you use a handkerchief.

153
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:24,685
Don't tell me

154
00:08:24,686 --> 00:08:26,486
it was in the toilet?

155
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:31,885
Yes. President Dejima came in contact

156
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,885
with the poison in the toilet and was killed

157
00:08:34,886 --> 00:08:38,486
by one of the three employees over there!

158
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:51,456
But Dr. Agasa,

159
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:54,856
there was no poison reaction found in the toilet.

160
00:08:54,857 --> 00:08:57,157
It's only natural that there was no reaction.

161
00:08:58,157 --> 00:09:03,056
Because the thing with the poison smeared on it

162
00:09:03,057 --> 00:09:06,856
was taken out of the toilet by President Dejima himself.

163
00:09:06,857 --> 00:09:08,656
What?

164
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:10,256
It was taken out?

165
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:12,956
You know, the thing that you have to throw away

166
00:09:12,957 --> 00:09:15,656
once it's been used up.

167
00:09:15,657 --> 00:09:18,456
There wasn't any freshener inside.

168
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,856
And if he had changed the towel,

169
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:22,956
there would've been a cleaner one inside.

170
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:25,456
Then, all that's left would be changing the toilet paper...

171
00:09:25,457 --> 00:09:29,056
Right! The cylinder!

172
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:31,456
It's the cylinder of the toilet paper!

173
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:34,156
If poison is smeared on it and it's left in place,

174
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,356
when the paper runs out and the roll has to be changed,

175
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:37,756
the person would take the empty roll

176
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:39,556
out of the toilet to dispose of it!

177
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:42,356
But if that was the case,

178
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:44,756
poison should be found on the toilet paper

179
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:46,757
that had been newly changed.

180
00:09:48,057 --> 00:09:49,256
Usually, after you change the toilet paper roll,

181
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:50,556
you would use it, wouldn't you?

182
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:53,956
But in this case, the part with the poison on it

183
00:09:53,957 --> 00:09:58,656
was torn off, used and flushed down the toilet.

184
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:00,657
-I see. -I see.

185
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:04,557
You see, are you convinced now?

186
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:11,057
And this is probably what President Dejima did in the toilet.

187
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:15,556
First, he realized that the roll was out of paper.

188
00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:17,856
He touched the roll with poison on it with his right hand

189
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:19,956
and put it on the floor.

190
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:22,156
Then, he reached over for the new roll of toilet paper

191
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:24,356
on the shelf and replaced it.

192
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,556
After finished using the toilet paper,

193
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:29,356
he pulled his slacks up with his poisoned right hand,

194
00:10:29,357 --> 00:10:31,156
fastened his belt,

195
00:10:31,157 --> 00:10:32,956
and flushed the toilet with the lever

196
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:36,656
on the left side of the tank with his right hand.

197
00:10:36,657 --> 00:10:38,157
After washing his hands,

198
00:10:39,357 --> 00:10:40,456
if he wiped his hands with the handkerchief,

199
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:42,256
the poison would be wiped off.

200
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:45,556
And if he exited the toilet with the empty roll,

201
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:48,756
no poison would be left inside the toilet.

202
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:52,756
But the poison was detected on the victim's left hand.

203
00:10:52,757 --> 00:10:55,556
He wasn't left-handed, so why would the poison

204
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:57,456
that was on the roll go on his left hand?

205
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,256
Come on, Inspector!

206
00:10:59,257 --> 00:11:01,056
If you open the door with your right hand,

207
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:04,157
you would naturally hold the roll with your left hand, wouldn't you?

208
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:10,856
I see.

209
00:11:10,857 --> 00:11:12,856
So, he brought the roll out of the toilet

210
00:11:12,857 --> 00:11:14,256
and threw it into the wastebasket,

211
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,856
then grabbed the burger with his poisoned left hand,

212
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:20,456
ate it, and died.

213
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:22,957
Shall we test it out?

214
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:26,557
Let's go into the toilet.

215
00:11:33,757 --> 00:11:36,456
Wait, Dr. Agasa!

216
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:40,256
The most important thing isn't solved yet!

217
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:42,156
Who of the three employees

218
00:11:42,157 --> 00:11:44,757
was the one that set up this trick?

219
00:11:45,857 --> 00:11:47,356
The most suspicious would be the one

220
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:51,356
who went into the toilet right before the president.

221
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:53,156
Hold it.

222
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:54,756
Isn't it strange?

223
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,156
It's true that the president

224
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:59,256
can be poisoned to death in the way he just explained,

225
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:01,756
but unless the president had the runs, went to the toilet

226
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:03,456
and used the toilet paper

227
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:06,356
while somebody went out to buy the hamburgers,

228
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:08,556
this crime wouldn't have occurred.

229
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:10,256
Besides, the president was the one who said

230
00:12:10,257 --> 00:12:11,857
he wanted to eat hamburger.

231
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:18,057
It did fit in a bit too well.

232
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:23,457
That's why the killer carried out repeated simulations.

233
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:28,356
President Dejima had probably never dreamed

234
00:12:28,357 --> 00:12:32,057
that the coffee which Mr. Imai served him everyday...

235
00:12:33,157 --> 00:12:35,757
contained laxative.

236
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,057
-Laxative? -Laxative?

237
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:42,156
Then...

238
00:12:42,157 --> 00:12:44,156
Mr. Imai's the one...

239
00:12:44,157 --> 00:12:45,257
What?

240
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:49,456
He put more laxative in the coffee everyday

241
00:12:49,457 --> 00:12:52,456
to get the president used to the taste,

242
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:53,856
and he calculated the timing of the president going to the toilet

243
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,456
with the amount of laxative he put in the coffee.

244
00:12:56,457 --> 00:13:00,856
So, the president had frequent runs lately because...

245
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:02,456
Yes.

246
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:05,256
And since the president ordered hamburger,

247
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:08,756
he decided to kill him today.

248
00:13:08,757 --> 00:13:12,956
Mr. Imai brought the cookie together with the coffee

249
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,856
so that it would urge the president to go to the toilet.

250
00:13:15,857 --> 00:13:20,656
When people eat, a strong peristaltic movement takes place

251
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:24,156
from the transverse colon to the sigmoid colon.

252
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:26,756
In other words, when something goes into the stomach,

253
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:29,157
there will be a need for bowel movement.

254
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:31,756
Well, if President Dejima was taking laxatives

255
00:13:31,757 --> 00:13:34,956
on a regular basis because of his hemorrhoids,

256
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:37,256
it wouldn't seem strange if laxatives were detected

257
00:13:37,257 --> 00:13:40,356
in his body during the autopsy.

258
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:43,256
Even if laxatives were to be found in his coffee...

259
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:46,056
We would think that he had been drinking coffee that way.

260
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:48,956
So, there would be nothing suspicious.

261
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:52,456
Which means that Mr. Imai set the poison up

262
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,556
when he went to the toilet.

263
00:13:54,557 --> 00:13:57,856
Hey! I went in before the president.

264
00:13:57,857 --> 00:13:59,756
If I hadn't urinated but had gone to move my bowels instead,

265
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:01,456
are you saying I would've been dead?

266
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:03,156
No.

267
00:14:03,157 --> 00:14:06,856
You always hold your drink in your left hand.

268
00:14:06,857 --> 00:14:07,956
And if you had to frequently urinate,

269
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:10,556
it isn't hard to imagine that you'd do the same.

270
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:11,956
If you had to moved your bowels,

271
00:14:11,957 --> 00:14:15,956
he would probably plan to give you a wet tissue or something,

272
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:19,256
telling you to wipe your hands before eating.

273
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:20,656
How can you tell if somebody's going to urinate

274
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:22,156
or move his bowels?

275
00:14:22,157 --> 00:14:24,956
He couldn't have looked into the toilet.

276
00:14:24,957 --> 00:14:28,056
From the sound of the toilet being flushed.

277
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:29,656
The sound of flushing?

278
00:14:29,657 --> 00:14:33,956
President Dejima had nagged everyone about saving water.

279
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,656
You wouldn't use the lever that flushes a lot of water

280
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:37,956
when you urinate, would you?

281
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:40,856
He knew that Conan and Ai who went into the toilet after you

282
00:14:40,857 --> 00:14:43,556
and were rushed out of there by the president

283
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:47,556
didn't touch the toilet paper roll smeared with poison.

284
00:14:47,557 --> 00:14:49,856
Okay! All we need to find now

285
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:52,356
is the roll that President Dejima threw away somewhere!

286
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:54,156
-Yes, sir! -Wait.

287
00:14:54,157 --> 00:14:56,457
He always throws it in here.

288
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:58,857
See? I found it.

289
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,957
Inspector!

290
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:04,357
Here, forensic officer!

291
00:15:05,357 --> 00:15:07,656
If there's poison on this,

292
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,556
there should be a bag that was used to carry it here

293
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:12,956
and a container for the poison somewhere.

294
00:15:12,957 --> 00:15:16,357
It's inside the triangular garbage disposer in the kitchen.

295
00:15:17,957 --> 00:15:21,056
If it were me, I would go to the toilet and set the poison up,

296
00:15:21,057 --> 00:15:25,056
then hide it in the kitchen while making coffee.

297
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,056
It's dirty and stinks,

298
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:29,856
so nobody would want to touch it.

299
00:15:29,857 --> 00:15:32,556
He wouldn't have to go and dispose of it himself

300
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,157
because somebody else would probably do it for him anyway.

301
00:15:38,957 --> 00:15:41,456
And unlike the wastebasket,

302
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,456
just in case he wanted to change the place he hid it,

303
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:45,157
it would be easy to retrieve.

304
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:51,656
Inspector! I found a strange plastic bag

305
00:15:51,657 --> 00:15:53,856
inside the triangular garbage container in the kitchen.

306
00:15:53,857 --> 00:15:55,256
You did!

307
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:57,556
If poison is detected from this bag

308
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,356
and your fingerprints are found on it...

309
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:01,757
I'm sure you'll find both.

310
00:16:02,757 --> 00:16:06,356
I had it on me day and night so that I wouldn't miss

311
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:09,257
the chance to kill the president.

312
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:15,056
I first intended to kill him about 20 years ago.

313
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,256
Twenty years ago?

314
00:16:17,257 --> 00:16:18,756
Yeah.

315
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:22,056
Not too long after you joined this office.

316
00:16:22,057 --> 00:16:25,556
Do you remember when I went independent and quit the job here,

317
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:27,756
then came back again?

318
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:29,256
It was back then.

319
00:16:29,257 --> 00:16:32,456
Yeah, I heard about it from the president some time ago.

320
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:34,556
You went independent, but couldn't make it,

321
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:36,057
so he accepted you again.

322
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:39,256
I couldn't make it?

323
00:16:39,257 --> 00:16:41,856
There was no way I could make it.

324
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:43,656
Because the president was moving behind the scenes

325
00:16:43,657 --> 00:16:46,156
and contacted the publishing companies,

326
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:48,957
telling them not to give a traitor any work.

327
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:52,056
Are you serious?

328
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:55,856
Yeah, a publisher friend told me.

329
00:16:55,857 --> 00:16:59,257
I was also enraged then, to the point of no return.

330
00:17:00,457 --> 00:17:04,056
I was thinking of how to kill him when he came back.

331
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:06,657
I was thinking all sorts of things in the kitchen.

332
00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:09,256
Then it just so happened

333
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:10,756
that Akemi who was there with her parents

334
00:17:10,757 --> 00:17:13,756
was standing behind me.

335
00:17:13,757 --> 00:17:15,956
She asked me, "What's wrong? You look scary.

336
00:17:15,957 --> 00:17:17,056
Are you looking for something?

337
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:20,556
Or are you hiding something?

338
00:17:20,557 --> 00:17:24,056
Don't hide it in the triangular garbage container

339
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:26,657
because somebody might throw it away."

340
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:30,556
She remarked with a sad look on her face.

341
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:35,156
When I answered, "I think I was just tired",

342
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:37,157
she just smiled.

343
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,156
It was after that

344
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:46,256
that Akemi started hiding our things all over the place.

345
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:49,656
But after seeing her innocent smile,

346
00:17:49,657 --> 00:17:52,457
my will to kill vanished off somewhere.

347
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:58,356
Then why did you decide to go through it at this time?

348
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:00,156
The other day, when I told the president

349
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:04,056
I wanted to go independent again, this is what he said.

350
00:18:04,057 --> 00:18:06,956
"You would never make it at your age.

351
00:18:06,957 --> 00:18:08,656
It would've been a different story

352
00:18:08,657 --> 00:18:11,456
if this were 20 years ago though."

353
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,856
When I saw her again after such a long time,

354
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:15,156
I felt like anything was possible.

355
00:18:15,157 --> 00:18:17,557
But the president's words made me blow my top.

356
00:18:18,357 --> 00:18:20,456
"Her"?

357
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:22,957
Do you mean Akemi who came to use the restroom?

358
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:27,556
Yeah. I was kind of expecting her to come around again

359
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:30,556
after she smiled at me and said...

360
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:33,556
I'll come back again in about a week

361
00:18:33,557 --> 00:18:35,357
with my younger sister.

362
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:39,056
But she never came.

363
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:41,156
I thought that she would

364
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:44,856
blow off my intent to kill with that smile of hers again,

365
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,857
but I guess I was just being selfish.

366
00:18:56,357 --> 00:18:57,756
So?

367
00:18:57,757 --> 00:18:59,756
You found it, didn't you?

368
00:18:59,757 --> 00:19:02,656
When you went into the restroom with Dr. Agasa.

369
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:04,757
The thing that Akemi hid.

370
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:08,556
Yeah.

371
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:11,156
It dawned on me when they said,

372
00:19:11,157 --> 00:19:13,756
as soon as your sister came to use the restroom,

373
00:19:13,757 --> 00:19:16,156
President Dejima started nagging them

374
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:18,256
about saving water all of a sudden.

375
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,656
An object must've been attached

376
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:22,756
to the float in the toilet tank

377
00:19:22,757 --> 00:19:25,657
which caused the water to flow out little by little.

378
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:31,356
I opened the tank and checked behind the float.

379
00:19:31,357 --> 00:19:33,556
And it turned out that a plastic bag with something inside it

380
00:19:33,557 --> 00:19:36,257
was firmly attached to the float with masking tape.

381
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:40,556
There were traces of old masking tape on it too,

382
00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:41,856
so it's most likely that 20 years ago,

383
00:19:41,857 --> 00:19:43,856
your sister took Mr. Imai's words,

384
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:46,356
"I think I'm just tired" too seriously

385
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:47,456
and hid the pens and rulers

386
00:19:47,457 --> 00:19:49,257
so he could take a rest from work.

387
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:54,056
Then, 20 years later, she came back again,

388
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:56,356
removed the things she had hidden

389
00:19:56,357 --> 00:19:59,457
and replaced them with these.

390
00:20:00,257 --> 00:20:02,556
She put these cassette tapes

391
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:06,756
numbered from 1 to 20 in this plastic bag.

392
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:09,556
Cassette tapes?

393
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:11,856
Yeah. I think that there's at least some clues

394
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:14,656
about those guys in here.

395
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:16,056
Some really important information

396
00:20:16,057 --> 00:20:17,456
that she wishes to keep a secret

397
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:19,756
from the Men in Black who are watching her.

398
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:22,256
Hey! Don't tell me

399
00:20:22,257 --> 00:20:24,256
that you're listening to it now?

400
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:28,856
Yeah. I'm listening to the one numbered 11 to 15,

401
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:30,456
but the top part of the tape is blank,

402
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:31,756
so I haven't heard anything yet.

403
00:20:31,757 --> 00:20:33,356
No, don't!

404
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,456
It's something you don't need to know about!

405
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:37,957
If you delve any deeper, you'll really...

406
00:20:41,357 --> 00:20:43,456
Sorry, Ai.

407
00:20:43,457 --> 00:20:46,856
This is definitely a tape I shouldn't be listening to.

408
00:20:46,857 --> 00:20:50,257
It's yours. A voice only for you.

409
00:20:51,157 --> 00:20:52,257
Listen to it.

410
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,956
To Shiho who has turned 11 years old.

411
00:21:00,957 --> 00:21:02,757
Happy birthday.

412
00:21:03,557 --> 00:21:04,757
Mother?

413
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:08,757
Have you found somebody you like?

414
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:12,156
My first love was when...

415
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:14,656
She probably gave the tape to Akemi

416
00:21:14,657 --> 00:21:16,657
after feeling that her life would soon be ending.

417
00:21:17,657 --> 00:21:21,256
She sent words to her maturing daughter

418
00:21:21,257 --> 00:21:23,357
about the love she felt for her.

419
00:21:24,657 --> 00:21:26,256
Akemi who received the tape

420
00:21:26,257 --> 00:21:29,256
couldn't give it to Ai because of severe monitoring.

421
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:32,156
But she probably remembered hiding things

422
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,256
at the design office in the past and hid it in the toilet there

423
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:36,957
so she could secretly give it to you.

424
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:40,657
I'm happy for you, Ai.

425
00:21:43,657 --> 00:21:44,957
Mother...

426
00:21:46,657 --> 00:21:51,357
Your mother was genuinely an angel.

427
00:22:16,557 --> 00:22:18,756
Sorry to keep you waiting.

428
00:22:18,757 --> 00:22:23,056
I don't think I'll need any help from you.

429
00:22:23,057 --> 00:22:27,956
Get her the minute you see her. Understand?

430
00:22:27,957 --> 00:22:29,357
Calvados.
