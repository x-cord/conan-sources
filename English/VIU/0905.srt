I can't believe we're spending the weekend

12
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:55,643
in such a wonderful place.

13
00:02:55,644 --> 00:02:58,044
Sometimes, you have some chic ideas, Dad.

What's that?

"Nishiokuho, Guest House Hatobue Lodge" -This is...

16
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:04,844
an article about the boarding house we're staying at today...

17
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:07,343
"The place has the best beer!" -Apparently, the boarding house...

18
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:10,743
has a wide variety of beers.

19
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:13,943
I see. So that's what Dad's after.

20
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,944
I'm going to drink.

Who's the Prince of Beer?

22
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:23,243
Otaro Minakitaya.

23
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,143
He's an entertainer who recently became popular

24
00:03:25,144 --> 00:03:27,243
for hosting variety shows.

25
00:03:27,244 --> 00:03:30,143
His knowledge of beer that he displays on blogs and talk shows

26
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:32,443
is supposed to be amazing.

27
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:34,544
So that makes him the Prince of Beer.

28
00:03:35,544 --> 00:03:37,943
He used to be part of

29
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:41,443
the comedy duo Otaro Minakitaya and Kyujiro.

30

But his partner Kyujiro committed an act of violence.

31
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:46,943
Their duo was dissolved.

32
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:49,243
That was three years ago, I believe.

Indeed. I am the great detective Kogoro Mouri.

Yeah. Are you?

00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:15,043
Yes.

42
00:04:15,044 --> 00:04:17,043
How could I not

43
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:19,844
after the Prince of Beer spoke so highly of it?

44

49
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,343
In that case, I'll take you to the lodge.

50
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:42,043
Get in, please.

Thank you for coming.

58
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:25,744
I'm Asako Yuri, owner of the Hatobue Lodge.

59
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,343
This is my daughter Miona.

60
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:39,343
Welcome.

61
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:41,343
You must be exhausted.

62
00:05:41,344 --> 00:05:43,044
Have a seat.

63
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:48,843
Were these taken around here?

64
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:52,243
Yes. The scenery around here is beautiful.

65
00:05:52,244 --> 00:05:55,743
I recommend you go for a walk before dinner.

66
00:05:55,744 --> 00:05:57,944
What are these?

67
00:05:58,844 --> 00:06:01,343
They're cow magnets.

68
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:05,643
Cows sometimes swallow nails

69
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:08,644
or bits of metal in addition to grass.

70
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,943
It's dangerous to leave them inside their bodies,

71
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:14,443
so we feed them powerful magnets

72
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:17,843
to grab the pieces of metal in their stomachs.

73
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,143
And that's called a cow magnet.

74
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:21,643
I see.

75
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:23,743
The guests staying here last night

76
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:26,143
stuck bottle caps to them.

77
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:28,444
But there's an even more fun thing you can do with them.

78
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:36,543
You take turns sticking these onto the magnet.

79
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:38,244
And then...

80
00:06:39,844 --> 00:06:42,643
Whoever makes the chain collapse loses.

81
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:45,943
Those weren't here last time I came.

82
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:48,943
Otaro, you're early.

The Prince of Beer?

86
00:06:56,544 --> 00:06:58,843
I... I'm a huge fan!

87
00:06:58,844 --> 00:07:01,243
Could I get your autograph?

88
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:02,744
Sure.

89
00:07:03,844 --> 00:07:05,643
Gladly.

90

91
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:08,444
Thank you!

92
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:12,943
I got his autograph.

"Otaro Minakitaya"

94
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,643

Otaro, have some tea.

96
00:07:20,144 --> 00:07:22,544
Thank you, Asako.

97
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,143
Do you come here often?

98
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:31,443
Yeah. This place has a huge selection of beers.

99
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:36,043
Enjoying your favorite beers in a quiet place with clean air

100
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:38,143
is the ultimate luxury.

101
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:40,244
I come once a month.

102
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:43,643
What's that symbol?

103
00:07:43,644 --> 00:07:44,843
Oh, this?

104
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:45,844
"Masked Comet Byun"

105
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:48,444
It's the symbol of Masked Comet Byun.

106
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:52,343
The TV hero?

107
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:55,743
The show aired seven years ago.

108
00:07:55,744 --> 00:07:59,043
It's about a hero who fights to protect the Earth

109
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:01,543
from the Hell Comet's Demon King Dyark

110
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:05,144
and his quest for world domination.

111
00:08:06,244 --> 00:08:11,443
Byun himself was once a henchman of the Hell Comet,

112
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:14,843
but he's touched by the kindness of an Earthling girl,

113
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:18,844
reforms his ways, and becomes the defender of the Earth.

114
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:22,543
I remember now.

115
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:27,543
But wasn't the show canceled?

116
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:31,143
Yeah, just when the story was reaching its climax.

117
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,343
Of course, it was canceled.

118
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:34,844
Its ratings were terrible.

119
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:39,044
Ratings have nothing to do with the quality of the show.

120
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:42,344
It was pretty cool.

121
00:08:54,444 --> 00:08:55,743
Miona!

122
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,543
Calm down. Deep breaths.

123
00:08:58,544 --> 00:08:59,943
Is everything all right?

124
00:08:59,944 --> 00:09:02,344
Sorry about that.

125
00:09:11,144 --> 00:09:12,743
Oh, right.

126
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:15,643
We should start getting dinner ready.

127
00:09:15,644 --> 00:09:18,543
Dinner starts at six.

128
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:21,743
You're free to do what you want until then.

129
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:24,143
Maybe I'll go for a walk.

130
00:09:24,144 --> 00:09:26,443
-Care to join me? -Sure.

131
00:09:26,444 --> 00:09:28,344
Miona, why don't you come with us?

132
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:33,843
Okay.

133
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:36,743
In that case, I'll show you around.

134
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:38,043
What about you, Dad?

135
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,543
I'll be sleeping in our room until dinner.

136
00:09:40,544 --> 00:09:42,243
I'll pass, too.

137
00:09:42,244 --> 00:09:45,444
I'm going to read my book.

138
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,843
I need to call my manager,

139
00:09:50,844 --> 00:09:52,743
so I'll join you another time.

140
00:09:52,744 --> 00:09:54,443
Too bad.

141
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:56,043
Then the four of us will go.

142
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:57,344
Okay.

143
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:04,644
Did you drop this, Shirogane?

144
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:10,443
Thanks, kid.

145
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,344
You're welcome.

146
00:10:17,744 --> 00:10:21,643
Otaro bought a new car.

147
00:10:21,644 --> 00:10:24,143
First, he bought a light truck, then a sedan.

148
00:10:24,144 --> 00:10:26,243
I can't believe he has three cars.

149
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:28,544
Famous people really do live in a different world.

150
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:42,243
Muramatsu.

151
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:44,543
He seems to have drowned after all.

152
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:47,044
He had nothing identifying on his person.

153
00:10:49,244 --> 00:10:51,944
This is from that incident.

154
00:10:57,037 --> 00:11:01,636
Please enjoy this pre-dinner fruit beer.

155
00:11:01,637 --> 00:11:03,336
Fruit?

156
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:08,437
In Belgium, they've been making beer with fruit for ages.

157
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:13,236
Like cherries and raspberries.

158
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:15,436
What a pleasant aroma.

159
00:11:15,437 --> 00:11:17,536
Is this citron?

160
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:19,936
That's right. This beer lets you enjoy

161
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:23,937
the uniquely refreshing smell and taste of citron.

162
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:30,836
Let's toast to our meeting today.

163
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:32,736
Cheers...

164
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:34,137
Cheers.

165
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:43,137
The combination of sweet and sour flavors is interesting.

166
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,337
Next is a pilsner.

167
00:11:47,537 --> 00:11:51,437
Pilsners are well known in Japan.

168
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:55,637
They have a good balance of flavor, bitterness, and aroma.

169
00:11:56,837 --> 00:11:58,937
This is an IPA.

170
00:12:03,737 --> 00:12:06,237
You can't get enough of this intense bitterness.

171
00:12:10,637 --> 00:12:12,337
This meat is delicious.

172
00:12:13,737 --> 00:12:15,537
Next, we have a porter.

173
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:22,536
The fragrant aroma of roasted malt.

174
00:12:22,537 --> 00:12:25,736
The strong, bitter flavor of dark roast coffee

175
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:29,137
compliments the flavor of the meat.

176
00:12:33,137 --> 00:12:37,437
For dessert, enjoy this slightly unusual beer.

177
00:12:42,337 --> 00:12:44,437
Is this beer?

178
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:50,536
It's definitely beer.

179
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:54,736
It's not too bitter and has a crisp flavor.

180
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:56,136
You're right.

181
00:12:56,137 --> 00:13:00,736
Based on its color, I thought it'd be sweet like a Blue Hawaii.

182
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:04,236
This beer is dyed blue with gardenias.

183
00:13:04,237 --> 00:13:06,736
It tastes so different from how it looks.

184
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:08,536
It's confusing.

185
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,037
I was completely deceived by its appearance.

186
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:21,337
You lose.

187
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:28,637
He was here this afternoon.

188
00:13:30,137 --> 00:13:32,237
Excuse me.

189
00:13:35,237 --> 00:13:36,736
The police?

190
00:13:36,737 --> 00:13:38,936
So he's a cop.

191
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:43,936
Aren't you the detective Kogoro Mouri?

192
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:47,636
Indeed. I am the great detective.

193
00:13:47,637 --> 00:13:51,036
Muramatsu, like I told you this afternoon,

194
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:52,936
if you're here about that case...

195
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:56,036
I'm not here about that.

196
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:58,136
That case?

197
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,436
Around five this afternoon,

198
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:05,036
the body of a man was found in a lake seven kilometers east of here.

199
00:14:05,037 --> 00:14:07,736
What?

200
00:14:07,737 --> 00:14:09,636
We believe he drowned.

201
00:14:09,637 --> 00:14:13,136
We're currently considering all possibilities,

202
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:15,936
including accidental death, suicide and murder.

203
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:19,436
The river behind the lodge is connected to the lake,

204
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:23,337
so we've been canvassing along the river.

205
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:29,036
Do you recognize this man?

206
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:30,136
That man...

207
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:31,736
You know him?

208
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:35,237
Didn't he stay with us about two months ago?

209
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:41,136
"Shujiro Kitamoto"

210
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:44,336
This is him. Shujiro Kitamoto.

211
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:45,836
What?

212
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:47,137
What did you say?

213
00:14:49,637 --> 00:14:51,036
Is something wrong?

214
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:54,736
Huh? Aren't you Otaro Minakitaya?

215
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:56,636
This is Kyujiro.

216
00:14:56,637 --> 00:14:59,136
-What? -Your old partner?

217
00:14:59,137 --> 00:15:03,436
Yes. He's changed a lot,

218
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:06,736
but Shujiro Kitamoto is his real name.

219
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:09,936
When did you last see him?

220
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:14,236
Three years ago, when we dissolved our duo.

221
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:17,436
Rumor is he's an entertainment reporter now.

222
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:19,536
An entertainment reporter?

223
00:15:19,537 --> 00:15:23,337
Come to think of it, he did ask a lot of questions about you.

224
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:26,836
He doesn't have a very good reputation.

225
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:28,036
They say he'll even

226
00:15:28,037 --> 00:15:30,236
engage in criminal activity to get information.

227
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:32,536
He's also drowning in debt

228
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:34,836
and has some aggressive debt collectors after him.

229
00:15:34,837 --> 00:15:39,137
Maybe he was looking to report a scandal on you.

230
00:15:40,537 --> 00:15:42,836
Kyujiro...

231
00:15:42,837 --> 00:15:47,436
The estimated time of death is between noon and 1 pm today.

232
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:49,536
Where were you around that time?

233
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:53,236
I was recording at a studio in the city until 12:30 pm.

234
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:56,336
After that, I drove here.

235
00:15:56,337 --> 00:15:59,537
It took about two hours from the city.

236
00:16:00,737 --> 00:16:06,036
Noon to one is when we were on the train.

237
00:16:06,037 --> 00:16:07,436
What about you?

238
00:16:07,437 --> 00:16:11,436
We were getting ready for our guests here.

239
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,636
Yes.

240
00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:14,636
What about the rest of you?

241
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:16,936
We have nothing to do with this.

242
00:16:16,937 --> 00:16:18,937
We'd just like to know for reference.

243
00:16:20,937 --> 00:16:23,336
I was on the train.

244
00:16:23,337 --> 00:16:25,736
The same train as Mouri.

245
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:28,036
I was on the bus.

246
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:29,836
I took the 12 o'clock bus from Tatsukawa Station

247
00:16:29,837 --> 00:16:33,436
and arrived at Nishiokuho Station at 1:50 pm.

248
00:16:33,437 --> 00:16:36,236
I took the train an hour earlier

249
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:38,836
and was walking around the station.

250
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:42,837
Could you please identify yourselves?

251
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,736
Toru Shirogane.

252
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:47,636
I'm a writer for a local magazine.

253
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:50,836
Masanari Ide. I'm a web designer.

254
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:52,536
Hiroko Fujiyoshi.

255
00:16:52,537 --> 00:16:54,736
I'm an office worker for a stationery company.

256
00:16:54,737 --> 00:16:56,637
Do you recognize this?

257
00:16:57,937 --> 00:16:59,737
Masked Comet Byun!

258
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:08,236
Was Kyujiro interested in this kind of thing?

259
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:09,436
I'm not sure.

260
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:12,036
Miona, are you okay?

261
00:17:12,037 --> 00:17:13,636
Miona!

262
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:17,536
Miona didn't seem well

263
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,536
the last time the Masked Comet was mentioned either.

264
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:20,837
It's nothing.

265
00:17:21,937 --> 00:17:23,137
It's nothing.

266
00:17:24,237 --> 00:17:25,836
Come to think of it,

267
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:29,736
there was a robbery and murder in Haido City a long time ago.

268
00:17:29,737 --> 00:17:31,636
A financial company employee was murdered,

269
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:33,536
and a large amount of money was stolen.

270
00:17:33,537 --> 00:17:36,236
The culprits were wearing Masked Comet Byun

271
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:39,836
and Demon King Dyark masks.

272
00:17:39,837 --> 00:17:41,836
I think that was seven years ago.

273
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:43,536
"Robbery and Murder In Haido City"

274
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:44,636
Come to think of it,

275
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:48,336
there was a young girl who witnessed the crime.

276
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:49,937
A witness?

277
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,537
Miona!

278
00:17:56,337 --> 00:17:58,836
Miona, calm down.

279
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:01,037
She can lie down in the guestroom in the back.

280
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:15,037
Ide, why would you do that?

281
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:17,337
Gosh.

282
00:18:45,137 --> 00:18:48,337
"Robbery and Murder In Haido City"

283
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:02,237
Who could it be at this hour?

284
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:07,836
Fujiyoshi?

285
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:09,836
"Nishiokuho Police Station"

286
00:19:09,837 --> 00:19:12,036
It's an emergency, Muramatsu!

287
00:19:12,037 --> 00:19:13,336
What's wrong?

288
00:19:13,337 --> 00:19:16,736
The water found in the body's lungs wasn't lake water.

289
00:19:16,737 --> 00:19:18,436
It was ordinary tap water.

290
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:21,036
What? Which means...

291
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:22,336
Yes.

292
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:25,336
If the victim was murdered elsewhere

293
00:19:25,337 --> 00:19:30,536
and brought to the lake by car to be dumped...

294
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:34,137
Then Otaro Minakitaya could've done it.

295
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:39,536
Who would do this?

296
00:19:39,537 --> 00:19:42,336
I was thirsty and came down to get something to drink

297
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:43,636
when I found this.

298
00:19:43,637 --> 00:19:44,836
Dad.

299
00:19:44,837 --> 00:19:46,636
Otaro's not answering.

300
00:19:46,637 --> 00:19:48,336
His door's locked.

301
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:49,337
What?

302
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:50,737
What was that?

303
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:55,036
Otaro, are you all right?

304
00:19:55,037 --> 00:19:56,736
Please respond!

305
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,236
Otaro!

306
00:19:58,237 --> 00:20:00,636
Mouri, here's the spare key.

307
00:20:00,637 --> 00:20:01,937
Thank you.

308
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:08,136
It's not opening.

309
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:10,436
Maybe it's bolted shut.

310
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:12,836
What if he's collapsed inside?

311
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,837
Dad, let me.

312
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:28,537
Otaro!

313
00:20:31,037 --> 00:20:33,536
It's no use. He's dead.

314
00:20:33,537 --> 00:20:34,936
What?

315
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:36,336
He's still warm.

316
00:20:36,337 --> 00:20:39,836
It hasn't been long since he died.

317
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:43,637
Looks like the door was locked and bolted.

318
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:48,237
The window's locked, too.

319
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:05,736
Pops!

320
00:21:05,737 --> 00:21:08,036
There's blood over here.

321
00:21:08,037 --> 00:21:09,736
What?

322
00:21:09,737 --> 00:21:13,336
That's a bloody fingerprint, isn't it?

323
00:21:13,337 --> 00:21:15,037
Is it Otaro's?

324
00:21:21,537 --> 00:21:23,737
There's something drawn over there.

325
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,237
The symbol of the Masked Comet!

326
00:21:32,037 --> 00:21:34,436
Is it a dying message?

327
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:37,136
So it's murder?

328
00:21:37,137 --> 00:21:39,836
And the Masked Comet did it?

329
00:21:39,837 --> 00:21:41,536
Calm down.

330
00:21:41,537 --> 00:21:45,537
It's possible he was drunk, fell, and hit his head.

331
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:48,036
The Masked Comet's here...

332
00:21:48,037 --> 00:21:49,236
What?

333
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:52,736
I promise I forgot everything.

334
00:21:52,737 --> 00:21:54,037
I forgot...

335
00:21:54,837 --> 00:21:55,936
Miona?

336
00:21:55,937 --> 00:21:58,837
No!

337
00:22:02,537 --> 00:22:05,936
Miona!

338
00:22:05,937 --> 00:22:07,636
