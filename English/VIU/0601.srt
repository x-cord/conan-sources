1
00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:05,278
After the strange letter that Pop's received,

2
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,678
we were lead to the Kora Inn in Gunma Prefecture.

3
00:00:09,678 --> 00:00:14,178
We met Mr. Rokuro Tokubi and Mr. Kazuki Araiwa along the way

4
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:17,178
and found out that 11 years ago in the river near the inn,

5
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:19,978
Tatsuhiko Numayama, an elementary school student,

6
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:23,078
got swept away in a flood and died.

7
00:00:24,178 --> 00:00:29,378
Could this have been the "murder" mentioned in the letter?

8
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:33,178
Tatsuhiko's friends had set up a riverside grave stone

9
00:00:33,178 --> 00:00:36,678
was kicked by Tatsuhiko's father, Banzo, is somewhat strange.

10
00:00:36,678 --> 00:00:38,378
"Kora Inn"

11
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:39,578
The next morning,

12
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:42,478
Banzo is found dead in the attic of the inn,

13
00:00:42,478 --> 00:00:47,978
drowned in the water from reservoir where Tatsuhiko's body was found.

14
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:49,978
Could it have been the work of the water sprite

15
00:00:49,978 --> 00:00:52,378
that Ran mentioned seeing last night?

16
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:53,678
Or...

17
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:15,578
Brooding over passing seasons

18
00:01:15,578 --> 00:01:17,478
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

19
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,278
Inspector Yamamura of the Gunma Prefectural Police

20
00:01:19,278 --> 00:01:21,478
discloses the sad identity of the water sprite!

21
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:23,078
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:25,078
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:27,278
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

24
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:55,786
"The Water Sprite's Dream (Part 2)"

25
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,875
It seems that the journalist was telling the truth.

26
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:04,475
The editor-in-charge confirmed that they were talking on the phone

27
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,675
for over an hour without pausing.

28
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:10,075
So, he couldn't have drowned someone while making the call.

29
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:12,475
Inspector Yamamura!

30
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:15,475
We got alibis from all the employees!

31
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:16,875
It seems that at the time of the crime,

32
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,975
all of them were preparing breakfast...

33
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:21,075
Come again?

34
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,575
You see... At the time of the crime...

35
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:25,775
-From before that! -What?

36
00:03:25,775 --> 00:03:28,375
The alibis of the employees...

37
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,475
Before that.

38
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:34,075
Let see... Inspector Yamamura...

39
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:36,975
That's it...

40
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:39,575
Did you want to report something to Inspector Yamamura?

41
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:42,075
Yes... well, sort of...

42
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:44,775
To think that this hack was promoted to inspector.

43
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:46,075
We've also confirmed

44
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:49,575
that the water in question matched the water in the reservoir!

45
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:56,575
Then, was there anyone who snuck out of the inn last night?

46
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:57,975
The only ones who went out last night

47
00:03:57,975 --> 00:04:00,975
were your group and Mr. Nohira.

48
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:04,075
He said that he wanted to take pictures of this area

49
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:06,575
and left before you did.

50
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:10,475
It seems that he came back drenched after all of you came back.

51
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:14,175
Why did you all go out of the inn, Mr. Mouri?

52
00:04:14,175 --> 00:04:17,775
Because Ran said that she dropped her cell phone near the river,

53
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:19,575
so we went out to look for it.

54
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:22,575
That's when I saw it...

55
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:24,875
A real water sprite!

56
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,775
A water sprite again?

57
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:29,075
It is! It's really true!

58
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:32,875
It was standing near the river where I dropped my cell phone.

59
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,975
Then, didn't you take any pictures of it as proof?

60
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,075
You had the cell phone with you, didn't you?

61
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:40,275
I was so scared that it didn't dawn on me to...

62
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:43,875
I could draw it if you like.

63
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,175
"Rokuro Tokubi (42)" -I can draw in my wet sketchbook.

64
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:54,875
Yes, the beak was a bit larger!

65
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,175
About this big?

66
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:58,575
Yes... that's right!

67
00:04:58,575 --> 00:05:01,975
Strange. In order to use a water bucket to drown somebody,

68
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:03,875
at least a liter of water is needed,

69
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,975
but why can't the container with the water in it be located?

70
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:09,775
Mr. Tokubi's water ink bottles are filled,

71
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:11,975
and he's actually drawing with them right now too.

72
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:15,075
Mr. Araiwa's PET bottle was opened

73
00:05:15,075 --> 00:05:17,575
but it's still half filled with oolong tea.

74
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:21,175
All the water from his water pillow had been drained.

75
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:23,875
The most suspicious would be the multitude of film cases

76
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,575
that Mr. Nohira had on him.

77
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,875
But, he has an alibi proving that he was on the phone.

78
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,475
Besides, to begin with, Tatsuhiko, who was swept away by the river,

79
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:34,975
was wearing his swimming trunks only.

80
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:37,075
If he was in fact taking a swim in the cold,

81
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:39,475
would he be wearing shoes?

82
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:41,375
Besides, his shoes

83
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,075
were soiled with green stuff here and there.

84
00:05:44,075 --> 00:05:46,675
Amazing!

85
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:49,375
It looks just like it! It was just like that.

86
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,475
What?

87
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:56,475
Hey, Ran! Did you really see this thing?

88
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:59,075
Yep! It was exactly like this!

89
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:01,175
Could I take a look at it too?

90
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:13,575
Hey, don't tell me that the water sprite is the murderer?

91
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:16,475
No... It's...

92
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:17,675
It's not a water sprite...

93
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:19,675
This is indeed...

94
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:21,375
An alien!

95
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,375
-What? -What? Alien?

96
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,575
Yes! This is an age where space travel is possible,

97
00:06:27,575 --> 00:06:29,875
so it's not surprising

98
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,475
if a space being from outer space were to come here!

99
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:36,475
If so, where's the spaceship that the guy came on?

100
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:40,475
You shouldn't take their power of science lightly!

101
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:42,975
It could be a spaceship this small

102
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:45,175
and yet be carrying millions of space beings

103
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:48,575
that are shrunk and jam packed!

104
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,875
No joke!

105
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,975
Come on...

106
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:53,675
I see.

107
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:57,275
So it was tightly put into smaller containers.

108
00:06:57,275 --> 00:07:00,175
At any rate, since Ran witnessed this extraterrestrial life form

109
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:03,475
whose nature remains totally unknown to us,

110
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:07,575
I'm sure the culprit is none other than this alien!

111
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:11,575
Therefore, this case will be stored in the dark depths

112
00:07:11,575 --> 00:07:14,475
of the Gunma Prefectural Police HQ as classified top secret X-File

113
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,175
where it will never ever see the light of day!

114
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:20,075
Hey... Are you going to put it away as unsolved?

115
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:22,175
I mean, there's no such file is there.

116
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,675
But, why would an alien

117
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:26,875
be interested in the owner of this inn, Banzo?

118
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,375
Hey, don't take him seriously.

119
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,575
You heard about the fact, right?

120
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,575
That Banzo was always watching the river banks using binoculars

121
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:34,775
from the attic, didn't you?

122
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:38,175
I'm sure that Banzo saw them back then!

123
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:40,075
The multitude of aliens that look like water sprites

124
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:41,975
that were playing in the river!

125
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:45,775
That's why he was probably you know what...

126
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,675
Well, I guess it'll be simpler to work things out

127
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,575
by putting him to sleep this time.

128
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:58,875
Hey, Yamamura?

129
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,475
He looks just like you when you're Sleeping Kogoro, dad.

130
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:04,475
Don't tell me... It's the curse of the water sprite?

131
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:06,375
-Yes, the water sprite. -What?

132
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:10,075
Yes, when I called it, "water sprite", it suddenly hit me,

133
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:12,675
the truth of this case!

134
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:16,275
Even his non sequitur tie-ins are the same.

135
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:19,475
-What? Am I like that? -Yep!

136
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:23,875
Now, please call the remaining two suspects here.

137
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,475
I shall disclose the truth of the case to you!

138
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:31,775
Over the name of the inspector of Gunma Prefectural Police!

139
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:36,675
"Chrysanthemum Room" -You've figured who the culprit is?

140
00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:39,375
"Kazuki Araiwa, Bosuke Nohira" -And you gathered us here...

141
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:43,375
Don't tell me that the culprit is among us?

142
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,575
I thought all suspicions were cleared a while ago

143
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:49,475
when the Inspector and the others made the rounds through our rooms.

144
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:51,475
Right, Yamamura!

145
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:53,775
The point of this case

146
00:08:53,775 --> 00:08:56,075
is the water in the reservoir with a foul odor

147
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:57,875
that is 10 km ahead of here,

148
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,175
that drowned Mr. Banzo Numayama!

149
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:03,175
In order to drown him using the water dipper,

150
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,375
about 1 liter of water is necessary.

151
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,875
In other words, the one who put 1 liter of the smelly water

152
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,775
in some container and brought it in here is the culprit.

153
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:15,475
The bottles of color ink that Mr. Tokubi had

154
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:18,075
were almost all full

155
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:21,675
and he was in fact drawing using the ink.

156
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:25,175
Although Mr. Araiwa had two PET bottles of 500 ml of water

157
00:09:25,175 --> 00:09:27,775
and a water pillow in his bag,

158
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,675
the PET bottle was still half filled, and when he entered the inn,

159
00:09:31,675 --> 00:09:35,575
the water pillow was flattened out.

160
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,175
Neither of them could've brought the water in.

161
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:42,575
As for the journalist, Mr. Norihira, because of his job,

162
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:44,975
had a lot of film cases,

163
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:47,975
but at the time the crime was committed from 06:00 am to 07:00 am,

164
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:49,675
he was on the phone right through

165
00:09:49,675 --> 00:09:53,475
with his editor-in-charge, so he has a perfect alibi.

166
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:57,375
So, then, who among the three here is the culprit then?

167
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,975
Don't you think it's strange?

168
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,775
Putting aside Mr. Norihira who has an alibi

169
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:05,475
unless somebody knew of the contents of their belongings,

170
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:07,175
Mr. Araiwa and Mr. Tokubi

171
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:11,575
wouldn't have been able to avoid suspicion.

172
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:13,275
He probably brought the water in using a paper pack

173
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:15,075
or balloon and after committing the crime,

174
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:17,575
he could've torn the container up,

175
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,675
flush it down the toilet and act like nothing happened.

176
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:23,975
True...

177
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:27,075
But, we were able to verify the contents

178
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:30,175
of your belongings beforehand.

179
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:32,475
Why is that?

180
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:34,475
Mr. Tokubi!

181
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:39,875
You deliberately slipped and fell into the river,

182
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,575
then, spread out the contents of your bag

183
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:45,175
and showed it to us saying you wanted to check your belongings!

184
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:48,075
You did all this to set up the murder trick.

185
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:50,175
-What? -What?

186
00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:52,975
Then... don't tell me that...

187
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:55,975
Mr. Tokubi is the culprit?

188
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,180
Mr. Tokubi lured Mr. Mouri here by sending him

189
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,080
a letter under the suspicious name of Mika Tatezato.

190
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,380
Then you waited for his car to pass by on a road

191
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,480
on the way to the inn and got into his car.

192
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,480
Saying that you wanted to visit the grave of Tatsuhiko,

193
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,480
Banzo's son, which is located on the bank of the river.

194
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,980
Because you had to act out

195
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,180
accidentally falling into the river,

196
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,380
you deliberately made Mr. Araiwa who coincidentally visiting the grave,

197
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,580
fall along with you to also protect him from being suspected.

198
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,280
But, how did you know about the letter?

199
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,680
I told him about it!

200
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,780
I told him that we came to this inn because we got a strange letter,

201
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,780
whose name could be morphed into "water sprite".

202
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,380
But...

203
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,180
All Mr. Tokubi had were color ink bottles this small!

204
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,580
Just where in this bottle can you pour a liter of water?

205
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,180
Nine 60 ml bottles.

206
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,280
Sixteen 15 ml.

207
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,080
Including a 100 ml squirt bottle,

208
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,280
that makes 880 ml.

209
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,780
If water was poured all the way to the top of the bottles,

210
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,580
it'll add up close to 1 liter.

211
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,680
That's enough water to drown a person using a water bucket.

212
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,580
But, Mr. Tokubi was drawing using the color ink, wasn't he?

213
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,680
He was using all kinds of colors,

214
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,180
and even the bottles that he didn't use

215
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,380
have the same color ink corresponds to the label, you know?

216
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,880
He didn't use the squirt bottle, did he?

217
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,580
Look. The empty squirt bottle there on the floor!

218
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,980
Color ink is usually diluted when using,

219
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,180
because it's too thick if used as is.

220
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,280
Despite this, Mr. Tokubi finished drawing that painting

221
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
without adding a single drop of water.

222
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,480
Why? Because the undiluted color ink

223
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,380
was only in the dropper that was attached to the lid of the bottle,

224
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,080
and after the crime was committed, they were diluted using tap water.

225
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,780
Tap water?

226
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,380
I see...

227
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,280
He sucked the water up beforehand

228
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,280
using the dropper and emptied the bottle.

229
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,780
Then he filled up the empty space with water from the reservoir

230
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,080
and drowned Banzo.

231
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,180
After committing the crime,

232
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,780
he poured in the tap water and mixed it

233
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,380
with the left over solution in the dropper

234
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,580
to keep at least the color intact.

235
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,380
So, at a quick glance it would look like color ink.

236
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,980
Of course the tips were sealed with tape or something

237
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,280
to prevent the ink from mixing with the water from the reservoir.

238
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,880
As proof of this, when he checked his belongings

239
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
after falling into the water,

240
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,680
Mr. Tokubi didn't take the color ink bottles out of the cases.

241
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,880
If he did, it'll reveal the bottles not filled with vivid color ink,

242
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,280
but rather, dirty water from the reservoir.

243
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,980
How stupid can he get?

244
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,680
If he didn't draw such a picture, he may have gotten away with it.

245
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,080
He didn't have much of a choice.

246
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,680
After committing the crime, he had to clean out so many bottles

247
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,280
in such a short time is virtually impossible.

248
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,680
I'm sure that there is still some left

249
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,280
in the color ink bottles the remains of the substance

250
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,580
of the water from the reservoir.

251
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,380
That's why he went out of his way

252
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,680
and offered to draw of his own initiative.

253
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,080
He wanted to give everyone the impression

254
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,180
that the contents of the bottles were indeed color ink.

255
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,680
Well, if we ask forensics to check the composition of the color inks,

256
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,880
the result should soon be clear.

257
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,980
That can't be!

258
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,380
Mr. Tokubi couldn't possibly be the culprit!

259
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,380
Because...

260
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,780
Because Mr. Tokubi never failed to come to Tatsuhiko's grave

261
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,380
for the past 11 years, you know?

262
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,380
Even after he quit being a teacher, he still kept visiting!

263
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,180
How could you even think that Mr. Tokubi would kill Tatsuhiko's father?

264
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,380
It was because of his father!

265
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,680
-What? -What?

266
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,080
Because he was Tatsuhiko's father.

267
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,180
That's why all the more I couldn't forgive him!

268
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,480
Tatsuhiko was swept away by the river because of that guy!

269
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,980
It wouldn't be wrong to say he killed Tatsuhiko!

270
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,780
Mr. Tokubi...

271
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,980
I found Tatsuhiko in the dimly lit art room after school,

272
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,580
the day before he was swept away by the river.

273
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,280
Tatsuhiko was desperately rummaging the paint

274
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,280
that somebody had forgotten in the dimly lit room.

275
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,380
I thought that he wanted to draw something

276
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,580
so I gave him some brand new paint.

277
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,480
But a few days after Tatsuhiko was swept away by the river,

278
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,180
the guy returned the paint to me.

279
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,680
Since none of the colors seemed used,

280
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,980
I thought that he decided not to draw,

281
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:49,880
and kept the paint in memory of Tatshiko without using them.

282
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,480
But, a few days ago, I happened to realize.

283
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,680
Only the green color paint

284
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,480
was replaced by one of a different manufacturer!

285
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,280
-What? -Why only the color green?

286
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,480
I dug up the grave

287
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,780
after he was swept away by the river,

288
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,680
I checked the shoes that Tatsuhiko was wearing.

289
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
I was convinced...

290
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,880
There was green paint on the inside of Tatsuhiko's shoes

291
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
because on the day that he was swept away by the river,

292
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,980
Tatsuhiko had painted his entire body green!

293
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,580
His entire body green?

294
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,480
Hey! Don't tell me that...

295
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,380
Yeah... that's right!

296
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,480
Tatsuhiko's father had made Tatsuhiko go around the inn

297
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,780
in the figure of a water sprite

298
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,580
to attract guests to the inn!

299
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,180
Moreover, during a cold season like this!

300
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,580
No way...

301
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,180
Then, all the eye-witness reports were...

302
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,580
Probably Tatsuhiko acting out the water sprite

303
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,580
because the guy made him do it.

304
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,080
The fact that the guy took one shoe off

305
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,980
who he found floating in the reservoir,

306
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,280
hid it closed to his chest.

307
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,680
He returned the paint to me after replacing the green paint

308
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,380
were all to get rid of the evidence!

309
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,180
That's why that guy was always looking

310
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,680
through his binoculars from the attic!

311
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,580
He wanted to make sure that the other shoe

312
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,880
wouldn't be found!

313
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,480
You were wrong.

314
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,780
I think that Tatsuhiko decided to act like a sprite on his own.

315
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,080
And, secretly too, for the sake of his father's inn!

316
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,580
What're you talking about, boy?

317
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,280
Because if he were making his son do it in secret,

318
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,080
he'd make his son go and buy the paint!

319
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,780
If anyone were to find him rummaging through the paint,

320
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,180
it would give away the fact

321
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,280
that he were acting out the water sprite.

322
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,680
Besides, paints don't have to be bought in sets either,

323
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,680
and it's not strange for a child to be buying ink!

324
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,180
Then, why did he take the shoe from the corpse?

325
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,180
For Tatsuhiko's sake, I think.

326
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,980
He would be laughed that he died acting out the water sprite,

327
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,880
and moreover, it's his son's memento.

328
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,180
On top of that, he couldn't risk to be found,

329
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,080
I don't think he would carry it around in his pocket,

330
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,480
but would've gotten rid of it long time ago.

331
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,780
Don't you think so too, Mr. Araiwa?

332
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,780
Because when you heard Ran say she saw a water sprite,

333
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,780
you said that it may be a ghost, right?

334
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,080
You knew that Tatsuhiko was acting out the water sprite,

335
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,580
didn't you?

336
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,180
Actually...

337
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,880
The day Tatsuhiko got swept away by the river,

338
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,080
I was right near him.

339
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,580
-What? -What?

340
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,080
Back then, there was a rumor going around

341
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,380
that maybe somebody was acting as the water sprite when it got cold,

342
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,680
the water sprite didn't appear.

343
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,880
So, Tatsuhiko said that he's going to put on his act that day.

344
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,580
I told him not to do it because it started raining,

345
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,680
but he said it wasn't raining that hard yet so he'd be okay.

346
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,780
He then told me to go tell the guests

347
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,180
at the inn that the water sprite appeared.

348
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,480
But, it began to pour on my way back to the inn so,

349
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,880
I went back to tell him that we should cancel it.

350
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,280
Then, I saw Tatsuhiko's foot stuck between the rocks in the river.

351
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,280
I rushed back to go get Tatsuhiko's father.

352
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,380
But, when I got back, Tatsuhiko was already nowhere in sight.

353
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,280
Later after searching for him together,

354
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,380
you found him downstream floating in the reservoir?

355
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,780
Yep. As he was removing Tatsuhiko's shoe,

356
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,880
Banzo told me not to tell anybody

357
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,280
that Tatsuhiko was acting as a water sprite.

358
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,380
Because if someone were to copy him and end up like Tatsuhiko,

359
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,280
it would make Tatsuhiko very sad.

360
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,180
I see...

361
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,780
That's why he was always watching over the river.

362
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,780
He wasn't only watching to prevent somebody from being swept away,

363
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,980
but also to stop them from acting as a water sprite.

364
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,580
That can't be...

365
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,880
No way...

366
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,380
But, what about the rumor about that old man

367
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,580
snooping around the grave night after night, then?

368
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,580
He was probably

369
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,280
fixing the grave that he had kicked down in order

370
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,180
to keep Tatsuhiko's friends away from the river.

371
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,080
Although it was a grave made of stones being piled up,

372
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,880
it was a precious grave that his son's friends had made.

373
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,280
As if in response to Mr. Tokubi's wailing voice,

374
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,180
as he was taken away.

375
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,880
The surroundings were dyed

376
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,180
with the sad color of the sunset.

377
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,380
Well, you impressed me, Yamamura!

378
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,580
I guess becoming an inspector rubbed off on you?

379
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,580
I have no idea what he's talking about.

380
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,480
Well, since the case has been solved,

381
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,780
how about going out and drinking up tonight?

382
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,880
Sounds good!

383
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,680
Hey, hold it!

384
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,780
The mystery of the water sprite I saw hasn't been solved yet.

385
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,980
What? Are you still talking such nonsense?

386
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,680
Come on... Enough already.

387
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,480
I'm telling you that I really saw it!

388
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,780
So, like everyone's saying,

389
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,580
you were so scared and frightened

390
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,180
so your fear made you see what you saw!

391
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,180
What's with you?

392
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,680
Talking to me like a grown up trying to reason with a child.

393
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,580
I mean, you're still only a child yourself.

394
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,180
Water sprite?

395
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,480
-What? -What?

396
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,080
It's appeared!

397
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,380
Hey, Ran, get rid of it using karate!

398
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,380
What? No way!

399
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,180
So you're the one who was disguised as a water sprite?

400
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,580
I went near the grave last night hoping

401
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,680
to get some good pictures.

402
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,080
Then, you guys came along and surprised me,

403
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,680
so I slipped and fell into the water!

404
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,480
Since your daughter made a fuss about a water sprite,

405
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,080
I figured I'd stay quiet since I didn't want to end up

406
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,280
being suspected as the culprit.

407
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,780
But,

408
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,480
this picture shows a thinner body.

409
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,680
The lower stomach part is popped out and there's furry looking stuff

410
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,280
showing from under the shell.

411
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,080
His body looks thinner

412
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,280
because he was drenched from falling into the water

413
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,280
and his clothes stuck flat against his body.

414
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,380
And, he looked to have a pop belly

415
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,780
because he had something inside there, right?

416
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,080
Yeah. Film cases and all sorts of other things.

417
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,980
So then...

418
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,080
What's that flurry thing under the shell?

419
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,780
I sometimes do survival games,

420
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,380
so I camouflage my entire body with leaves.

421
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,080
What an idiot!

422
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,980
Well, the case is closed.

423
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,080
There!

424
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,180
Give it your best shot!

425
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,680
Coach!

426
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,480
This is...

427
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,280
The truth of this case has came to me as a flash of inspiration!

428
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,480
Really?

429
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,880
Yes! In other words, the culprit is...

430
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,480
You, Ms. Suzuki!

431
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,880
What?

432
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,380
Next Conan,

433

434
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,480
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480

00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,580
Wishing all of you a good year!
