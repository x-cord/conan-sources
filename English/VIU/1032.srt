1
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,500
Kasuga Ryuji (30) Artist

2
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,029
Finally arriving after swaying back and forth,

3
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,829
draw close to mysteries and begin deducing the truth!

4
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,459
Facing an artist, Ran smiles!

5
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,209
But her prim pose hints at a case!

6
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,699
Always determining the one truth

7
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,319
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,780
his name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,630
"Mori Ran, the Model!"

10
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,340
A modeling job, huh?

11
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,080
Conan-kun, you must be bored.

12
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,479
No, this is super interesting.

13
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,950
Professional artists are incredible.

14
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,690
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

15
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,769
Kasuga-sensei and Ran-san, why don't we take a break?

16
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,400
I've made some tea.

17
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,940
Yes, let's.

18
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,230
Thank you.

19
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,130
I should be able to finish today as planned.

20
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,280
It was quite the twist of fate.

21
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,750
I went out to do some shopping that day.

22
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,180
My ideal model happened to show up there.

23
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,380
E-Excuse me.

24
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,940
Yes?

25
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,060
But you didn't know who he was.

26
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,859
I'm sorry that I didn't know at the time that you were a famous artist.

27
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,949
It's fine. It just means I still have a long way to go.

28
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,200
Your works are special, Kasuga-sensei.

29
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,450
What was that?

30
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,990
Hello.

31
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,760
Hey.

32
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:45,040
Hello.

33
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,550
Uh...?

34
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,599
This is Conan-kun.

35
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,259
He came to watch since Ran-san's painting will be finished today.

36
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,480
Hello.

37
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,839
Hello. I'm Kasuga-sensei's apprentice Komiyama Yoshio.

38
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,560
Conan-kun, you must like art, too.

39
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,830
Yeah.

40
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,070
I can't tell them I came because I was worried about her.

41
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,069
Well, I'm going to get started on my work.

42
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,920
Really? Why don't you join us?

43
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,540
Thank you, but I'm fine.

44
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,640
Has Komiyama-san been an apprentice for a long time?

45
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,999
What? No.

46
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,310
He's a new artist who just recently became an apprentice.

47
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,310
Huh.

48
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,660
Sir, we should get back to work soon.

49
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,060
Got it. Thank you.

50
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,860
But first, I'm going to check on Komiyama-kun.

51
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,080
Kasuga-sensei really trusts you, Riko-san.

52
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,790
I don't know about that.

53
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,930
For him, keeping track of time is just an assistant's job.

54
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,599
Why?

55
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,669
Kasuga-sensei becomes absorbed in his ideas when they come to mind,

56
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,859
so he often loses his belongings.

57
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,319
That's why he doesn't carry anything with him.

58
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,400
He doesn't even wear a watch.

59
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,460
I see.

60
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,960
Nice colors.

61
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,080
Thank you.

62
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,220
Sir, there's something I've always wanted to ask you.

63
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,420
Why have you been drawing portraits recently?

64
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,039
You're opposed to the idea, too?

65
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,930
Sometimes I feel like drawing whatever I want.

66
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,060
I didn't mean it like that.

67
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:16,710
I was just wondering why you suddenly switched to drawing portraits—of all female models, no less.

68
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,559
Is there some criteria you use to choose your models?

69
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,020
No. They're all strangers I scout around town.

70
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,080
I guess I follow my intuition.

71
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,160
I see.

72
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,469
Models aren't important to me.

73
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,050
They're simply tools used to evoke an image.

74
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,970
In the end, my art is everything to me.

75
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,400
But it would seem some realities can't be improved upon.

76
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,360
There they are.

77
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,490
Hey, who are you?

78
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,829
Hello. I'm Edogawa Conan.

79
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,779
I'm visiting the studio.

80
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,770
I see.

81
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,780
Nothing's happened to the model this time, right?

82
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:33,830
What?

83
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,280
The truth is, there are some shady circumstances concerning his models.

84
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,329
Shady circumstances?

85
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,190
Well, he had two previous female models...

86
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,800
Tell me more about that.

87
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,760
Huh? Come to think of it...

88
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,930
Conan-kun said he was going to check out the yard.

89
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:07,070
I'm sorry. He always runs off before I know it.

90
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,929
The weather's nice today.

91
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,060
I understand the desire to go outside.

92
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,220
Let's hurry up and finish this for his sake, too.

93
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,530
This is the place.

94
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,200
Someone pushed me from behind here.

95
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,590
Is something the matter?

96
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,140
No. How about witnesses?

97
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,880
Did they see anyone suspicious?

98
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,490
No.

99
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,600
Apparently not.

100
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,690
Come to think of it, I saw Kasuga-san on my way here that day.

101
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,700
What?

102
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,580
I saw him from behind, so I'm not 100% sure.

103
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,960
I think he was sitting on the riverbank and looking at the river.

104
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,830
I was scouted to model for him around here, too.

105
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,220
I thought he must come here often and didn't think much of it.

106
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,080
Don't let it bother you.

107
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,590
Huh?

108
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,840
Riko-san isn't too fond of me making these paintings that don't bring in any money.

109
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,680
I-I see.

110
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,549
Riko-san isn't just my assistant.

111
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,610
She's also my manager.

112
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,550
As someone who handles money, I'm sure it's a nuisance.

113
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,860
I understand that, but...

114
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,380
This is the place.

115
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:56,140
I was waiting for the light to change here when someone pushed me from behind.

116
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,309
You didn't see the culprit?

117
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,179
No. This place is deserted at night.

118
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,700
The police said there weren't any witnesses.

119
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,950
The only clue to the culprit's identity is the sound that I heard.

120
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,180
What sound?

121
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,910
Like a clattering sound.

122
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:22,710
I felt like I'd heard it before, but I don't know what it was.

123
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:28,450
I see. Where were you scouted for modeling work?

124
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,200
What? Oh, at a nearby café.

125
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,249
Come to think of it,

126
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,350
I might've seen Kasuga-sensei around here on the day of the incident.

127
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,500
What?

128
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,340
I thought Kasuga-sensei had gone home after he finished working,

129
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,510
but maybe he was on his way to that café.

130
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,740
It seems like he's a regular there.

131
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,020
But that random attack ruined everything.

132
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,090
I'm on my university's track team.

133
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,470
Because of my injury, I'm not sure I'll be able to run like I used to.

134
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,849
My brother's really bitter about it

135
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,160
and says he'll do whatever it takes to catch the culprit.

136
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,030
Your brother?

137
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,689
Komiyama-san?

138
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,680
Oh, uh...

139
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,559
I'm sorry. I'm looking for materials.

140
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,310
What is this room?

141
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,419
It's Kasuga-sensei's late wife's room.

142
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,070
What? Really?

143
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,539
There aren't any materials in here. You should head back.

144
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,310
A-All right.

145
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,969
Our Standard Date Route

146
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,969
Evening at the Riverbank

147
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,970
Our Usual Vienna Coffees at the Café

148
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,840
This is my brother.

149
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,230
So that's how it is.

150
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,250
All right.

151
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,110
Hey, Machiko-san. By any chance...

152
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,120
It's done.

153
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,330
Did the incident occur...

154
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,169
Let's sign this and call it done.

155
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,010
Yes, sir.

156
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,010
...the day your painting was completed?

157
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,810
Thank you for modeling.

158
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,649
That better be true.

159
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,890
It definitely is.

160
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,679
Kasuga-sensei lost his wife six months ago in an accident.

161
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,800
Since they were such lovebirds, he was terribly depressed about it.

162
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,800
He couldn't even enter his studio.

163
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:27,680
After a while, he suddenly started finding models and painting again.

164
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:34,230
But both models were attacked by someone on their way home.

165
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,319
I learned that the incidents always occurred on the day their paintings were finished.

166
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,830
And Ran's painting will be finished today.

167
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,529
Damn it. Hurry, kid!

168
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,300
Yeah!

169
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,390
Kasuga Ryuji.

170
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,910
We need to talk.

171
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,880
What's the matter?

172
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,140
You're the one who pushed my sister.

173
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,130
Huh?

174
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,289
My real name is Nogami Yoshio.

175
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,030
I'm the brother of Nogami Machiko, one of your models!

176
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,080
What?

177
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:29,729
On her way home from this studio,

178
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,070
my sister was attacked by someone and badly injured.

179
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,200
I've been searching for the culprit.

180
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,580
I joined your studio, looking for information.

181
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,410
I've been watching you.

182
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,549
It was shortly after joining your studio

183
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,029
that I learned my sister wasn't the only victim.

184
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,209
Another model suffered an accident, too.

185
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,220
What?

186
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,099
Today, after seeing a room in your studio that I hadn't investigated yet,

187
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,480
I finally learned what your motive is.

188
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,170
The shock of losing your wife drove you crazy!

189
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,939
You're approaching women in locations that were important to you and your wife,

190
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,990
having them model for you, and then hurting them once the painting is complete.

191
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,489
Sir, that can't possibly be—

192
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,909
No, wait!

193
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,569
Kasuga, you're coming with me to see the police.

194
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,920
It's true that in my heart, I was painting my wife.

195
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,670
I thought it might help me get over her.

196
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,510
That much is true.

197
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,770
But attacking models? I have no idea what you're talking about.

198
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,029
You're playing dumb?

199
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,090
Because of you, my sister's dream was shattered.

200
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,810
Hey, what are you doing?

201
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,709
I'm glad you're all right.

202
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,480
Are you Mori Kogoro?

203
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,990
Dad.

204
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,290
You're Ran-san's father?

205
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,040
I see. Mori...

206
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,650
I'm surprised. I didn't know Detective Mori was on the case.

207
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,490
What? Uh, yeah, sure.

208
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,090
But I just...

209
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,790
Just happened to...

210
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,920
Sorry, old man.

211
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,979
That's right.

212
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,430
I looked into the place where my precious daughter was working.

213
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,680
Komiyama-san, you believed the following to be true about the attacks:

214
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:35,500
Both models were attacked on their way home from the studio in deserted areas.

215
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,260
Therefore, the culprit must've followed the victims since they left the studio.

216
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,830
In other words, you believed the culprit must be someone from the studio.

217
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,899
Yes, that's right. That's why Kasuga is—

218
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,610
As you deduced, the culprit is someone from this studio.

219
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,960
But it's not Kasuga-san.

220
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,360
It's not me. Don't do that. What are you—

221
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,850
Unfortunately, there's proof, Rokui Riko-san.

222
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,720
At first I suspected Kasuga-san as well.

223
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:23,490
After all, he was spotted near both crime scenes when the attacks took place.

224
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:30,120
However, I found the testimony of Nogami Machiko-san, the second victim, strange.

225
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,890
She heard a certain sound when she was attacked.

226
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,869
That's right. Kasuga-san doesn't carry anything with him.

227
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,120
If he'd done it, the victim wouldn't have heard anything.

228
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,010
Apparently it was a clattering sound.

229
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,440
I believe it may have been the sound of a sketching pencil.

230
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,520
As an artist's assistant, you carry those around with you all the time.

231
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,700
But that's not enough to—

232
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,650
Of course, that's not all.

233
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,700
I have proof that you're the culprit.

234
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,450
The pole of the steps Ayu-san was pushed down was scratched.

235
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,880
Some paint had come off.

236
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:21,710
You probably grabbed onto that pole when you tried to push Ayu-san.

237
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,270
Your wristwatch has a metal band,

238
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,550
but one part is shaped differently from the others.

239
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,340
Not only that, but it seems rather new.

240
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:43,100
Perhaps you damaged it during the attack and had it repaired in a hurry.

241
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,299
This is, uh...

242
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,020
We'll know once we check with the watch repairman.

243
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,089
No way. You're kidding, right?

244
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,880
W-Wait a minute. Why would you attack them?

245
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,050
Because I hated the models.

246
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:13,910
I was a fan of Kasuga-sensei and asked him to make me his assistant.

247
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,650
Spending time together while he was working made me so happy.

248
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,910
But that was taken from me.

249
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,790
I wondered why I couldn't be his model.

250
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,160
Before I knew it, I was following them.

251
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,410
And then...

252
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,130
How wonderful.

253
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,059
I can't allow someone who doesn't even know who Kasuga-sensei is

254
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,810
to have this painting made of her!

255
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,070
Crap!

256
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:16,450
Kasuga-sensei told me that I was the last portrait he'd paint.

257
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,769
Once he finished,

258
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,170
he wanted to paint for work with you again

259
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,010
because you supported him.

260
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,680
No...

261
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,820
Kumagaya

262
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,910
Rice crackers!

263
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,140
So this is her new job.

264
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,189
Perfect for me, right?

265
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,600
Yeah. It's important to choose for yourself.

266
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,330
What?

267
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,609
What?

268
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,119
You don't know?

269
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,020
Seriously?

270
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,539
Double H refers to...

271
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,160
Come on, really?

272
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,780
Damn it, Chukichi.

273
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:02,699
Yumi-tan? As in Taiko Meijin's girlfriend Yumi-san?

274
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,560
We hear about you from the Meijin all the time.

275
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,650
So, what are you guys all doing together?

276
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,079
The next episode of Conan is

277
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,370
"Taiko Meijin's Shogi Board, Opening Move!"
