1
00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:03,259
Ran and I accompanied

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:07,859
Pops to the wedding eve of Pop's old friend.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,700
Amidst the gala atmosphere,

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,500
the bride, Hatsune Kamon goes off to the nail salon

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,800
to prepare for her wedding.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,700
But two hours later,

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,200
Hatsune leaving behind the word "Goodbye"

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,600
is found burned to death

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,400
along with an explosion that occurred in the parking lot.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,100
At first, it was thought that she had committed suicide

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,700
but, from Hatsune's fake nail with a piece of skin on it,

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,100
that was found at the scene,

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,500
DNA that was virtually matched that of Mr. Raita Banba,

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,800
the groom was found.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,900
Mr. Banba denies committing the crime.

16
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,400
He claims that the waiter

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,900
who had secretly been seeing Hatsune is suspicious

18
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,700
but, he turns out to be a detective that was hired by Hatsune.

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,300
He seems to have been checking on Mr. Banba's daily affairs.

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,800
His testimony was backed up by the detective that Mr. Banba had hired.

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,400
Mr. Banba agrees to go through another DNA test.

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,400
The vivid coloured memories of summer.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,500
Solve mysteries all season round.

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,200
The past of the two tells of everything.

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,300
What is the proof that he is not the culprit?

26
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,900
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,100
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,500
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,139
"Wedding Eve (Part 2)"

30
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,239
Inspector Megure.

31
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,039
There's one door at the back of this restaurant

32
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,039
that leads to the parking lot.

33
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,139
But, since it was raining hard when the incident occurred,

34
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:20,039
that door seemed to have been locked.

35
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,439
Which means in order to get out of the restaurant,

36
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,739
there was no other way than to go through the front entrance?

37
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:25,839
Yes.

38
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:30,139
But if so, I'm sure that one of the guests would've remembered.

39
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:32,639
Are there no other way in and out of the restaurant?

40
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,739
You could try to make it out of the window of the toilet.

41
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:38,239
But, outside the window the road is not paved

42
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,339
and there's a big puddle,

43
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:41,739
so if anyone did pass through here,

44
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,139
there should be some traces of footprints left behind.

45
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,139
At the time of the incident, it seems to have been windy,

46
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:52,639
because Hatsune's umbrella was found

47
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,339
blown to the very end of the parking lot.

48
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:56,839
Wind?

49
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:59,139
Come to think of it,

50
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,639
when we got to this restaurant it was pretty windy.

51
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,939
And? Do you detectives have anything that comes to mind?

52
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:08,139
Not in particular.

53
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:11,339
When I told him that she was secretly seeing some other man,

54
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:13,339
he was quite out of sorts

55
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:15,339
but recently it seems that he was more concerned

56
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:19,139
about the fact that she was secretly talking to somebody over the phone.

57
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,339
Well, but she was only probably contacting this guy.

58
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:28,139
Oh, no. I contacted her only by mail.

59
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,939
The only time I met her outside was just once,

60
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,639
the time you saw her with me.

61
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,239
Only there was just one time when her face clouded.

62
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:38,939
-Her face clouded? -Yes.

63
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:40,539
I'm a detective so,

64
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:43,839
I was checking in detail on Banba.

65
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,239
Then I found out about something.

66
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:48,739
Found out about something?

67
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:52,739
He and Hatsune were both rescued from a hotel fire.

68
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:54,839
Although both their identities weren't known,

69
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,539
they were raised in the same church.

70
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:02,239
Which means that both their parents died in the fire?

71
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:07,339
It seems to have been a pretty big fire with many casualties,

72
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:08,839
and both of them were babies.

73
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,339
Which means they were childhood friends?

74
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:17,039
No, he seems to have been adopted right away

75
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,039
but she was raised in church for some time.

76
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,039
But, why did her face cloud because of it?

77
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:25,239
I wonder...

78
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:28,239
She said that she would check on things herself later.

79
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:31,939
Ran.

80
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:34,639
How tall was Hatsune?

81
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,339
She was shorter than you, wasn't she?

82
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:38,439
Yes.

83
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:42,539
Besides, she was wearing boots with pretty high heels.

84
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,139
I think she was much shorter than me,

85
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:46,739
like about 5 feet or so.

86
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:50,039
But why are you asking me something like that?

87
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,939
The average height of Japanese women is about 5 feet 3 inches or so.

88
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:57,539
Inspector Megure!

89
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
Did you get results for the DNA test already?

90
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,739
No, not yet.

91
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,339
According to forensics,

92
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,739
one fake nail is missing from the body.

93
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:12,139
So, that's the one that was found near the car.

94
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,939
No, if that's included, then there are two missing in total.

95
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:20,939
Then did the remaining one burn in the car to ashes?

96
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:23,039
Or...

97
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:25,439
Conan.

98
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,439
The place I found the umbrella?

99
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,439
What's asking something like that going to do?

100
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,339
Pops Kogoro told me to go and ask you.

101
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:38,339
It was hooked on to this car at the end,

102
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,639
like this...

103
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,939
Hey, you! Kid!

104
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:46,039
If the fake nail were to have come off,

105
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,439
it may have fallen into the inside of the umbrella

106
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:51,039
and if it would've been blown away together...

107
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,339
Here it is.

108
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:57,839
Moreover the tire and the body of the car served to rain-proof it,

109
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,839
so it's virtually not soiled at all.

110
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,739
Are the things on the tip of the nail...

111
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:03,739
skin and blood?

112
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,839
Sir, there is a fake nail under this car.

113
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:14,239
It probably belonged to the lady who died,

114
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,939
so can you pick it up carefully?

115
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:18,939
Please check the things on the tip of the nail very carefully.

116
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:19,939
Yes.

117
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:29,439
I'm sure that this will clarify things of who killed her

118
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,839
and if it's just as I've deducted...

119
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,039
the sad truth that you didn't want to know about

120
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:41,339
will be exposed in broad daylight.

121
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,039
Darn. What the heck is going on anyway?

122
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,239
Darn!

123
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,339
Hey. It's about time you really cool it, Banba.

124
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:00,139
You understand that you're in a grave predicament, don't you?

125
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,339
Hatsune burns to death in a car

126
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:04,539
that is parked in the parking lot of this restaurant,

127
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:07,039
and on the fake nail that was found near that car,

128
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,239
skin that looked to be like that of the culprit was stuck to it.

129
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,239
The DNA of the skin virtually matched the DNA of your hair

130
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:17,539
that was found on the hairbrush.

131
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,739
Under these circumstances,

132
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:20,939
it can't be helped if you emerge as the culprit.

133
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:26,439
So now, did you ever let anyone use that hairbrush?

134
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,739
Use?

135
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:31,439
Like when a friend spent the night at your house or something.

136
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,639
I wonder...

137
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,039
I don't remember any such time.

138
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,139
Hatsune and I have been living together since six months ago.

139
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:41,539
A detective from somewhere that Hatsune invited over

140
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:44,539
may have used it when I wasn't home, though.

141
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:48,939
It's true that I'm a detective that was hired by her

142
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:51,339
but I never went to your house.

143
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:55,639
I can't really say if that detective thing is for real or not too.

144
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,139
Now that Hatsune's dead,

145
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:00,339
there's nobody who can prove that.

146
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,139
If that detective was so sharp

147
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:04,639
as to divert the attention of the detective that I hired

148
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,139
so that he got away each time he was tailed,

149
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:08,639
it would've been easy for him to plant somebody else's hair

150
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,939
on my hairbrush when he came over,

151
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:14,739
and set me up for something I didn't do.

152
00:09:14,739 --> 00:09:15,839
Oh, no.

153
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,739
I'm not the spy type.

154
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:21,239
Well, I guess not.

155
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:24,739
I just got a report on the DNA test result.

156
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:27,639
I has been confirmed that the hair

157
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,439
on the hairbrush was unmistakably Mr. Banba's!

158
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,239
No joke...

159
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,239
Yes.

160
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,939
Which means that...

161
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:38,639
You who mistook me, a detective that was hired by Hatsune,

162
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,239
for her lover,

163
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:42,539
from feelings of jealousy that aroused

164
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:43,939
started harboring murderous intent.

165
00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:46,239
Therefore, there's no other option than to think that you waited for her

166
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,339
to come back at the parking lot of this restaurant,

167
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:51,839
shoved her into the car and burned her to death.

168
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,239
Why you...

169
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,439
Then,

170
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:57,039
you will voluntarily come to the station with me?

171
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,739
Wait, I tell you.

172
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:00,539
Mouri, do something, will you?

173
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:02,839
There's not much I can do.

174
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,839
-Mouri... -Let's go.

175
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:06,739
Okay.

176
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,439
I re-parked the police car a little distance from here

177
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:12,439
and since it's raining you may get wet without an umbrella.

178
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:13,939
It started raining again?

179
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:16,139
Yes, and pretty hard too.

180
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:18,539
I don't really mind getting wet, though.

181
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:26,439
No kidding, it's raining hard.

182
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:28,339
Are sure it's okay, Banba?

183
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:29,439
Really?

184
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:34,839
Are you sure you want to leave this restaurant?

185
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:37,739
Even if I don't want to, I've got no choice, do I?

186
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:39,539
At this rate, I've got to go to the police

187
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,039
to have them prove my innocence.

188
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,039
I see.

189
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:48,139
If so, you're not the culprit.

190
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:56,627
Dad.

191
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:58,527
Hey, hey, Mr. Mouri.

192
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:02,027
Although he did agree to going voluntarily to the station,

193
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:05,427
that doesn't mean that he's not the culprit, does it?

194
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:06,927
He may be thinking that even if he's interrogated

195
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:11,327
he won't get caught if he doesn't confess to his crime.

196
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:13,227
No way.

197
00:11:13,227 --> 00:11:15,827
Then please try to recall the circumstances

198
00:11:15,827 --> 00:11:19,527
when Hatsune's car went up in flames.

199
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:22,027
The door leading to the parking lot from this restaurant

200
00:11:22,027 --> 00:11:25,127
was locked because it was raining.

201
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:27,227
Going in and out from the toilet window is also unthinkable

202
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:30,027
because below that window there was a big puddle,

203
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:33,527
but the culprit's footprints weren't found anywhere near it.

204
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:37,527
If so, the only way out is through the front entrance of the restaurant.

205
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:41,827
But, if the main character of today's wedding party leaves the restaurant,

206
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,627
somebody is bound to have seen him, right?

207
00:11:46,127 --> 00:11:49,727
My deduction would be it wasn't that nobody noticed,

208
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:51,827
it's just that no one was aware.

209
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:54,327
Just what do you mean?

210
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:57,327
He disguised himself in the men's room.

211
00:11:57,327 --> 00:11:59,427
He had hidden the clothes to carry out his plan,

212
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,927
in the men's room beforehand.

213
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:02,827
For example, if he wears a knitted cap

214
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:05,227
and long windbreaker,

215
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:07,827
nobody would notice that it's him.

216
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,627
More so because he greeted everyone at the beginning of the party

217
00:12:11,627 --> 00:12:15,227
and imprinted what he was wearing onto their memory.

218
00:12:15,227 --> 00:12:19,827
Then what about the call I made to Hatsune

219
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:21,827
just before the car went up in flames?

220
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:25,127
Hatsune was crying and saying goodbye, you know?

221
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:28,027
Did you really call her just before the car went up in flames?

222
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:29,327
What?

223
00:12:29,327 --> 00:12:33,627
Isn't it a fact that you waited for her in the parking lot in disguise,

224
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:38,027
and called her after she got out of the car?

225
00:12:39,227 --> 00:12:41,527
You did this so that you could pass her out

226
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,327
while she was distracted by your phone call.

227
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:47,227
Although she put up a bit of a fight,

228
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:50,327
you somehow managed to shove her into the car.

229
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:53,027
After setting fire to the car,

230
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:54,827
you rushed back to the restaurant,

231
00:12:54,827 --> 00:12:57,227
and changed into your original clothes in the men's room.

232
00:12:57,227 --> 00:13:01,027
Then later, you deliberately punched me, the waiter, and hurt yourself

233
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:04,327
in order to hide the place that she scratched you.

234
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:07,927
All you needed to do next was to conspicuously pretend to call her

235
00:13:07,927 --> 00:13:09,527
and make the people around you think that

236
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:12,627
she was saying what sounded like a suicidal message.

237
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:14,427
You look out the window

238
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:18,127
and make the others realize that her car is burning.

239
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:21,127
This way, you end up being the poor man

240
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:25,127
who beloved woman committed suicide.

241
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:26,827
You were lucky that just about that time,

242
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:30,227
the spray can in the car exploded.

243
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,927
That's all nonsense.

244
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:34,727
Hatsune really said goodbye to me.

245
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:36,627
Please check Hatsune's cell phone.

246
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:39,027
It should be in the car.

247
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,827
We did find a burnt black cell phone.

248
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:43,927
But, even if we're able to recover the data,

249
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:46,127
we can't retrieve what kind of conversation you had...

250
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:48,327
But, if we go by that deduction the clothes

251
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,827
and things that were used for the disguise

252
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:51,927
should've been found in the toilet.

253
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:54,927
He probably shredded it and flushed it down the toilet.

254
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:56,727
Of course that's possible with a knitted cap.

255
00:13:56,727 --> 00:14:01,027
As for the flimsy nylon windbreaker, it's easy to shred.

256
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:02,627
What about the shoes?

257
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:06,927
You can shred shoes that easily.

258
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:11,027
There's no need to change shoes.

259
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:13,127
If you keep on walking without stopping

260
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:16,027
nobody can tell what kind of shoes you're wearing.

261
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:19,227
In fact, the shoes he was wearing

262
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:21,427
was sneakers that are sold everywhere.

263
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,127
Okay, Banba.

264
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:24,827
Take off your sneakers and show him

265
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:27,027
the sole of your sneakers.

266
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:33,727
That's the proof that'll show that you're not the culprit.

267
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:37,527
There is something that looks like cream

268
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:38,827
in the groove of the sole of his shoe.

269
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:40,327
What?

270
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:42,927
I think that's chocolate cake.

271
00:14:42,927 --> 00:14:46,327
Mr. Banba was stepping on the cake that fell to the floor.

272
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:48,527
When did he step on it?

273
00:14:48,527 --> 00:14:52,527
Before Hatsune left this restaurant to go to the nail salon.

274
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:54,627
I see.

275
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,427
If he walked in that heavy rain at the time the incident happened,

276
00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:01,627
most of this cream would've come off.

277
00:15:01,627 --> 00:15:04,627
More so, if he rushed back to the restaurant

278
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:05,827
after committing the crime.

279
00:15:05,827 --> 00:15:07,127
I see.

280
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:10,027
In other words, he didn't leave the restaurant.

281
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:11,427
No.

282
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:14,627
In fact, when I first saw that,

283
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:17,827
I thought it was foul play that Mr. Banba was putting on.

284
00:15:18,927 --> 00:15:21,827
That he somehow managed to change his shoes

285
00:15:21,827 --> 00:15:24,327
to show me the cream on the sole of his shoe as proof

286
00:15:24,327 --> 00:15:28,127
that he didn't leave the restaurant.

287
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,627
But, he coincidentally stepped on the cake

288
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:33,827
after that young detective dropped it

289
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:36,327
and Banba never said a word

290
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:39,027
about the cream on the sole of his shoe to me.

291
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:42,127
And more so, he's about to leave the restaurant in the rain

292
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:46,127
and would be getting rid of very important evidence.

293
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:50,927
That's what convinced me that the cream wasn't fake,

294
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:54,927
but rather, evidence that would prove Banba's innocence.

295
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:56,827
Mouri.

296
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:59,427
But, what about the DNA?

297
00:15:59,427 --> 00:16:02,227
On the tip of her fake nail was the DNA of a piece of skin

298
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,727
that virtually matched his.

299
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:08,227
That's only proof that he was near her at that time, is it not?

300
00:16:08,227 --> 00:16:10,027
Didn't it ever dawn on you

301
00:16:10,027 --> 00:16:13,627
that the skin on her fake nail may have been her own?

302
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:16,027
Just what do you think you're saying?

303
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:17,227
Like I mentioned earlier,

304
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,627
unless you're blood related,

305
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:22,027
it's impossible that genetic information would virtually match.

306
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:26,027
Currently, the chances of another person with the same type DNA appearing

307
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:29,027
is one in 4 trillion 7,000 billion people.

308
00:16:29,027 --> 00:16:33,327
Besides, women don't have the Y chromosome that men have,

309
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:35,227
so it's readily obvious.

310
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,827
It could be that they said virtually

311
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:38,527
because the skin in question,

312
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:40,527
was contaminated by rain and soil,

313
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:43,027
making it hard to determine the gender, right?

314
00:16:43,027 --> 00:16:44,427
Even so...

315
00:16:44,427 --> 00:16:46,327
Are you saying that such a twosome coincidentally ran into each other,

316
00:16:46,327 --> 00:16:50,027
fell in love and decided to marry each other?

317
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:53,127
They may have run into each other coincidentally,

318
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:56,727
but I think it was inevitable that they were attracted to each other.

319
00:16:56,727 --> 00:16:59,227
Because they were twins.

320
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:01,927
Twins?

321
00:17:12,427 --> 00:17:15,927
Banba you guys were saying,

322
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:18,827
our birthdays are the same,

323
00:17:18,827 --> 00:17:20,127
our blood types are the same,

324
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,427
and that you can tell what the other is thinking at times.

325
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:24,827
Yes.

326
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:26,827
But, that's not enough to make us twins.

327
00:17:26,827 --> 00:17:29,327
You may not have known about it,

328
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:31,727
but when Hatsune and you were babies,

329
00:17:31,727 --> 00:17:34,027
both of you were rescued from a hotel fire

330
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:38,327
and raised at a church with no way to find who you both were.

331
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:41,427
A hotel fire?

332
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,627
I see, since your parents burned to death in the fire,

333
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:46,927
no one knew you were twins.

334
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:50,827
Do twins have the same DNA?

335
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:53,627
It seems to be so for identical twins,

336
00:17:53,627 --> 00:17:54,827
but, in that case

337
00:17:54,827 --> 00:17:58,527
if I remember it's supposed to be two boys or two girls.

338
00:17:59,627 --> 00:18:01,827
It happens quite rarely.

339
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:05,027
When the chromosomes of the fertilized egg,

340
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:06,327
before splitting into two is XY,

341
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:09,227
in the case of men, during the split,

342
00:18:09,227 --> 00:18:13,227
the Y chromosome on one side because of some factor is lost,

343
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:15,627
resulting in XO and XY,

344
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:16,627
in other words,

345
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:22,027
identical twins of different genders are born.

346
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:24,127
Hey, hey. You're joking, right?

347
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,427
That Hatsune and I are twins.

348
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:29,427
Do you know how tall she was?

349
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:32,327
She said she was a bit more than 4 feet.

350
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:35,027
She was bothered about being short.

351
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:38,027
If so, the possibility is high.

352
00:18:39,127 --> 00:18:41,927
The female side of identical twins of different genders,

353
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:45,827
because of Turner's syndrome tend to be short.

354
00:18:45,827 --> 00:18:47,727
But...

355
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:51,827
why was Hatsune's own skin on her fake nail?

356
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:54,027
Can't you tell, Banba?

357
00:18:55,027 --> 00:18:56,727
After hearing from the young detective

358
00:18:56,727 --> 00:19:00,427
that you and her were rescued from the same fire,

359
00:19:00,427 --> 00:19:03,727
if she told him, "I'll check further for myself."

360
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,527
Then I can't think of anything else she would do

361
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:08,227
than to get a DNA analysis to clarify

362
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:11,127
whether you're both really twins.

363
00:19:11,127 --> 00:19:14,627
It is most likely that when she got back here from the nail salon,

364
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:16,527
and got off the car,

365
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:19,327
she got a call from the place that was doing the analysis

366
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:22,427
and was told the result...

367
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:26,527
that you and Hatsune could never get married

368
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:29,227
because you were blood related twins.

369
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:32,127
No...

370
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:35,127
No way...

371
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,727
Her skin was probably on the fake nail

372
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:44,627
because shocked at the result,

373
00:19:44,627 --> 00:19:49,127
she scratched her face and cried to the point her fake nail came off.

374
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:52,927
The fake nail that fell inside the umbrella she was holding then,

375
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:57,627
that was blown away is being checked now.

376
00:19:57,627 --> 00:20:00,127
Once the result is out I'm sure...

377
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:04,727
Yes, Megure here.

378
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:09,127
I see.

379
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:10,227
I got it.

380
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:14,427
Did the result of the other fake nail come out?

381
00:20:14,427 --> 00:20:16,627
Yes, on that fake nail,

382
00:20:16,627 --> 00:20:18,627
not only was there a blood stain on it,

383
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:20,427
it was virtually not contaminated at all.

384
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:25,127
It was a perfect match with Mr. Banba's DNA.

385
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:28,527
All except for the part that indicates the gender.

386
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:32,827
It seems to have match with her DNA

387
00:20:32,827 --> 00:20:34,927
that they barely managed to get from her corpse,

388
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:37,427
so the skin on the fake nail was concluded to be hers too.

389
00:20:37,427 --> 00:20:40,527
Then, she committed suicide after all?

390
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:45,427
That's the only thing thinkable.

391
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:49,627
But that company sure called her at a bad time.

392
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:53,327
Since they heard that the two were getting married tomorrow,

393
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:55,727
they wanted to let them know before it was too late

394
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:58,227
and before a fatal mistake was carried out.

395
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:02,427
Hatsune...

396
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:06,527
Hatsune!

397
00:21:08,927 --> 00:21:11,027
Hatsune!

398
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:20,727
Mr. Banba's scream tore through the sound of the rain and echoed.

399
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:27,027
We can't tell why she chose to burn herself to death,

400
00:21:27,027 --> 00:21:33,127
but maybe she wanted to go back in order to do things all over again.

401
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:37,627
Into the flames that lead them to this tragic destiny.

402
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:05,127
What? You want to be my disciple?

403
00:23:05,127 --> 00:23:07,927
You mean of this great Detective Kogoro Mouri?

404
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:09,427
Yes, of course.

405
00:23:09,427 --> 00:23:11,527
I decided I wanted to start from scratch

406
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:13,727
when I heard your great deduction the other day

407
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,427
and strongly felt how immature I still was.

408
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,627
That's why I want to work part-time near you

409
00:23:18,627 --> 00:23:22,527
and accompany you on the cases you go to handle.

410
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:26,227
But I don't take disciples...

411
00:23:27,227 --> 00:23:31,227
As tuition...

412
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:34,427
I don't mind paying I plan to pay you.

413
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:36,227
No joke?

414
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:40,127
You're hired!

415
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:44,127
From now on, call me "master", understand, Amuro?

416
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:45,527
Master Mouri.

417
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:50,427
A bit of trouble again.

418
00:23:53,027 --> 00:23:56,027
Kyodo.

419
00:23:56,027 --> 00:24:00,227
Come to think of it, that lady's name was Nanami Kyodo.

420
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:03,727
You mean Ran's senior in the Karate club.

421
00:24:03,727 --> 00:24:07,327
How is it, going guys? You want to go on an adventure?

422
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:08,727
-Yes! -Yes...

423
00:24:10,727 --> 00:24:12,527
Ai's not here.

424
00:24:13,627 --> 00:24:14,927
I'll be right there!

425
00:24:14,927 --> 00:24:17,427
Stay here, Ayumi!

426
00:24:17,427 --> 00:24:18,727
Next Conan,

427
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:22,727
"The Secret Treasure of the Dark Tower (Part 1)".
