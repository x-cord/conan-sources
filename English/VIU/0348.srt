1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,135
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,136 --> 00:00:06,035
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,036 --> 00:00:07,835
Good old country house.

4
00:00:07,836 --> 00:00:09,735
Attracting the tourists and attracting a crime or two.

5
00:00:09,736 --> 00:00:11,235
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,236 --> 00:00:13,135
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,136 --> 00:00:15,236
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:18,740
This is really a charming place.

9
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:21,440
There's something that feels familiar about this place!

10
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,641
"Nostal sick", as they say.

11
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:28,740
That's not it, Genta.

12
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:31,340
You mean nostalgic.

13
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:33,040
Since when did they change it?

14
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,940
Just how old do you think you are, anyway?

15
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:40,740
It certainly looks like a place that is talked of a lot

16
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:43,640
since it's going to be selected as a World Heritage.

17
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:46,540
Recently there's talk about something else

18
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,540
that is attracting people to come and see this place.

19
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,040
What is that, Conan?

20
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:54,040
What is it?

21
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,240
That is...

22
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,941
-The ghost story! -The ghost story.

23
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:02,941
Oh, you meanies, all of you.

24
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:07,540
Are there talks about a ghost?

25
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,240
From about half a year ago,

26
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:12,540
people started saying they witnessed a child ghost,

27
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,841
and the rumor seems to have spread.

28
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:17,441
Geez.

29
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:21,840
Don't you guys know this tour is a gift for solving a case?

30
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:25,240
Why don't you try to get a taste of good old Japan?

31
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:27,740
Indeed. For god's sake.

32
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,641
I'll try to get a taste of good old beer.

33
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,641
Come on in, sir!

34
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,441
That's him all right.

35
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:42,441
"Love, Ghosts and World Heritage (Part 1)"

36
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:47,740
This place really makes me feel as if we've time warped.

37
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:51,640
So, this is where we will stay for the night?

38
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:54,840
This place is a world heritage and inn for tourists.

39
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:57,840
This is really good old Japan.

40
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:00,840
There are three floors inside,

41
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,740
so it has more rooms than it looks like it has when seen from outside.

42
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:06,840
There must have been a large family living here.

43
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:09,040
Huh? That is...

44
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,040
What is it, Conan?

45
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:15,340
Well, the stone and the soil around the stone are new.

46
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:18,841
For a hundred year old house of heritage, it's strange...

47
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:23,340
They are going to stay with us.

48
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:25,340
Hello!

49
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:26,840
-Hello, nice meeting you. -Hello, nice meeting you.

50
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:29,440
Oh, the inn with the high rooftop.

51
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:30,840
Rumiko is very impressed!

52
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:32,340
So is Kanako!

53
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:35,140
What an old stinking place!

54
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,440
Can I take a hot bath?

55
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:39,340
"Kensaku Kawaji (37)" -How about air conditioning?

56
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:42,440
I guess you can't expect these things.

57
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:44,340
He's awful.

58
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:46,240
Rumiko, he'll hear you!

59
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:49,940
Did you say something, sisters?

60
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:52,640
You stop it! Don't be childish.

61
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:54,441
You're embarrassing them.

62
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,940
What did you say?

63
00:04:56,941 --> 00:04:58,840
I'm embarrassing you?

64
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,740
You said so, didn't you?

65
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:03,640
Stop it. How unsightly of you.

66
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:06,340
Did you tell me to stop?

67
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:07,840
Who are you, dirty old man?

68
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,340
If you want to address me at all,

69
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,640
you can call me,

70
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:12,540
Kogoro Mouri.

71
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,040
Mouri?

72
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,740
He means that...

73
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:18,440
The famous detective, Sleeping Kogoro?

74
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:22,140
They call me by that name, in spite of myself.

75
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:25,140
Did you hear that? "In spite of myself"! So theatrical.

76
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:26,540
No, I didn't.

77
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,140
Awesome! Rumiko is so impressed!

78
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:30,840
So you're a famous person, pops!

79
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:32,840
Stop it, ladies.

80
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:36,940
You are making my beer spill over.

81
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:40,140
"Shokichi Sakaki (52)" -My name is Shokichi Sakaki.

82
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:42,640
I'm honored to meet you, Mr. Mouri.

83
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:45,340
"Kazuaki Kuwashima (44)" -I'm Kazuaki Kuwashima.

84
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:46,540
Glad to meet you, sir.

85
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,840
And I am glad to meet you, gentlemen.

86
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,840
What a bore!

87
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:54,440
Excuse me, sir.

88
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:56,340
What?

89
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:58,440
"Iwao Nagakura (50), Kimiko Nagakura (45)" -Your inn is located

90
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,640
a block down, at Ishioka house.

91
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:04,141
Why didn't you tell them sooner?

92
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,940
How delicious! This pot of soup!

93
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:18,840
This iwana fish is so delicious too.

94
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:20,940
Delicious...

95
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:23,040
The aroma of this miso soup is so fine.

96
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,440
Yes. It warms your body.

97
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:28,440
Well, this hot sake is the best for winter.

98
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:29,740
Take one, please.

99
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:32,441
Thank you, sir. I will.

100
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,741
Lay off!

101
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,840
They made it up and put it on the magazine.

102
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:41,041
It's not real and you won't see it here.

103
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:45,040
Dear!

104
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,140
Don't you be rude to our guests.

105
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:48,740
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,640
We're facing a few problems recently...

107
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:54,340
What was that all about?

108
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:56,840
It's this, Ran. This article.

109
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:59,940
What about it?

110
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:03,140
"Ghost seen at the World Heritage site"?

111
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:06,340
Unexpected busy business bewilders people of the district.

112
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:08,640
"Unexpected selling point"?

113
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:10,740
We don't need any ghosts here.

114
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:12,940
What a nuisance!

115
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:13,941
I see.

116
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:15,240
It should be.

117
00:07:15,241 --> 00:07:18,040
A world heritage is the pride of the world.

118
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,340
So much so that it is an asset to all mankind.

119
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,541
It must have been a fuss for you.

120
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:28,840
How dare they use it to attract curious people here

121
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:30,440
as if this were another tourist attraction.

122
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:31,540
Here.

123
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,040
It must be tough.

124
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,540
Now this is for you.

125
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:38,140
I'm just doing my share to welcome you...

126
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:40,440
That's Mr. Mouri!

127
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:42,340
Your words are precious to us.

128
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:43,440
Now you can drink to that.

129
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:45,940
Well, thanks to you, I will.

130
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:48,040
You're the one to enjoy drinking.

131
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,240
Off you go with more drinks.

132
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:54,240
Hey. Now they have started...

133
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:56,240
Well, we are leaving now...

134
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,140
Thanks for everything!

135
00:07:58,141 --> 00:07:59,940
-Good night. -Good night.

136
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:01,940
You've done your share, guys.

137
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:04,740
Now let's drink up once more.

138
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:06,540
It's so delicious!

139
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,340
-Conan, we should be going now. -Okay.

140
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:11,240
What are we going to do? Sleep?

141
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,840
No way.

142
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:15,840
How can we go to sleep before making sure

143
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:17,240
if the ghost is real or not?

144
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:18,241
Of course.

145
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:22,740
Sure. We are here to search for facts!

146
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:24,240
Aren't we, Conan?

147
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:25,940
Me?

148
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:28,140
It suits you, Conan. Go with them.

149
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,840
I'll pass.

150
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:31,640
I'm staying here and going to read a book in the room.

151
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:32,941
Haibara!

152
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:41,840
What's the matter with you, Conan?

153
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:43,940
It's nothing.

154
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,640
By the way, we'll go take a walk for a while.

155
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,440
At this time of the day?

156
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:50,940
It's not that late.

157
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:54,541
Besides, I get to see the attraction over there.

158
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:01,941
Beware of fire!

159
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:07,041
Beware of fire!

160
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:10,640
I'm scared but it's beautiful!

161
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:13,340
It doesn't surprise me if it comes up in this setup.

162
00:09:13,341 --> 00:09:16,040
They do it every evening.

163
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:19,440
Each house sends someone in turn for the night watch.

164
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:23,040
Yes. Fire is the biggest enemy to a house with thatched roofs.

165
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,040
The best they can do is take precautions against fire for themselves.

166
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,740
The whole village takes and shares responsibility...

167
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:30,940
In a way, this is very reasonable.

168
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:32,240
All's well.

169
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:34,840
Good job and thank you.

170
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,441
Beware of fire!

171
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,940
Who...

172
00:09:43,941 --> 00:09:45,341
Are you?

173
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,641
Hey, who are you?

174
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:59,240
Beware of fire!

175
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:01,140
Where's Ayumi?

176
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:03,140
She was with us a moment ago.

177
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:04,440
Ayumi!

178
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:06,240
How did she get lost?

179
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:07,540
Ayumi!

180
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,940
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

181
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:14,140
I'm sure she was with us here.

182
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:17,440
I say she got hungry and went back to the inn alone.

183
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:19,940
Well, she is not like you, Genta.

184
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:21,640
Are you sure?

185
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:23,440
-What's that? -What?

186
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:24,541
Did you find her?

187
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:31,840
It's Ayumi's scarf.

188
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:33,441
I'm sure it is.

189
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:47,340
Wait.

190
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:48,640
What's your name?

191
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:50,540
Who are you?

192
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,441
Wait, don't leave me behind!

193
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:55,540
Wait!

194
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,740
Oh? Ayumi's lost?

195
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,340
I'm sorry. I guess we weren't careful enough.

196
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:04,640
We decided we should come back and search for her with more people.

197
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:07,541
I see. Let's all go look for her together.

198
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:09,941
Dad!

199
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:15,840
Gosh!

200
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,641
Come on, dad.

201
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,541
My husband too.

202
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:23,240
He never stops drinking once he starts drinking.

203
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:26,040
Let me call the villagers to help with the search.

204
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,640
-Sorry for the inconvenience. -Thank you.

205
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:29,940
I'll help you too.

206
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:31,041
Yeah.

207
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:33,840
Hey! What's the matter?

208
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:35,340
Is something wrong?

209
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:36,740
I'm gonna help you.

210
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:38,140
You can't and don't.

211
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:39,240
What's the matter with you?

212
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,341
I'm not trying to sell anything to you.

213
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:46,840
Ayumi!

214
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:50,141
-Ayumi! -Ayumi...

215
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:01,040
We've found her!

216
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,341
She's at the root of a Japanese cedar tree at Water God Shrine!

217
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:09,541
Ayumi!

218
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:12,840
Come on, Ayumi!

219
00:12:12,841 --> 00:12:14,141
Ayumi!

220
00:12:32,704 --> 00:12:35,203
What? Conan?

221
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:36,303
Ayumi!

222
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:38,103
Are you all right?

223
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:40,303
Oh, everybody.

224
00:12:40,304 --> 00:12:42,503
Do you feel any pain?

225
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:45,103
You appear to be free from injuries but...

226
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:47,603
I'm all right. No pain at all.

227
00:12:47,604 --> 00:12:49,403
Can you talk for a while?

228
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:51,003
Yes.

229
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,303
What actually happened?

230
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:55,603
It's...

231
00:12:55,604 --> 00:12:57,603
Did you see a girl?

232
00:12:57,604 --> 00:12:58,703
I did.

233
00:12:58,704 --> 00:13:01,903
She was about 10 years old, bobbed hair,

234
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:03,803
and wearing a red skirt,

235
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:05,104
Impossible!

236
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:12,503
It can't be.

237
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:14,203
Mr. Nagakura...

238
00:13:14,204 --> 00:13:17,703
She came to see Eiji. Mami did come.

239
00:13:17,704 --> 00:13:18,803
Mami?

240
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:21,003
That girl. Her name is Mami?

241
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:22,203
Yes.

242
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:26,003
Mami and Eiji had been friends since childhood.

243
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:27,903
Mami was a year younger

244
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:30,104
and they were very close friends.

245
00:13:37,704 --> 00:13:39,903
Yes. I'm sure it's her.

246
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:44,503
Mami believes that Eiji is not guilty and comes to see him.

247
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:45,703
Not guilty?

248
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:47,903
Cut it out!

249
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:49,603
Young lady,

250
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:51,603
you've mistaken something else for her,

251
00:13:51,604 --> 00:13:53,203
I'm sure of it.

252
00:13:53,204 --> 00:13:54,703
What?

253
00:13:54,704 --> 00:13:56,503
But how do you know?

254
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:58,503
I'm sure I saw her.

255
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,503
Do you doubt her, pops?

256
00:14:00,504 --> 00:14:03,803
Ayumi is an honest girl. She doesn't tell lies.

257
00:14:03,804 --> 00:14:05,303
Calm down, everybody!

258
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:10,003
Well, why are you certain that she saw wrong, Mr. Nagakura?

259
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:11,603
It's obvious!

260
00:14:11,604 --> 00:14:12,903
Because both of them...

261
00:14:12,904 --> 00:14:14,203
Eiji since last month,

262
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:15,703
and that girl since ten years ago,

263
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:17,303
have been dead.

264
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:19,203
What?

265
00:14:19,204 --> 00:14:21,403
Died ten years ago?

266
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:22,503
Then she was...

267
00:14:22,504 --> 00:14:23,904
A ghost...

268
00:14:26,204 --> 00:14:31,403
I can't stand that kind of a story.

269
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,203
-So it's true after all. -So they appeared.

270
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:34,903
I'm scared...

271
00:14:34,904 --> 00:14:37,203
Don't you worry, Keiko.

272
00:14:37,204 --> 00:14:40,603
What's the fuss all about?

273
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:43,103
Where have you been all this time, dad?

274
00:14:43,104 --> 00:14:44,703
What?

275
00:14:44,704 --> 00:14:46,003
All of you...

276
00:14:46,004 --> 00:14:47,703
Who's behind all this?

277
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:48,704
Dear...

278
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:49,704
What?

279
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:52,003
I got it. They are behind all this!

280
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:53,703
They?

281
00:14:53,704 --> 00:14:55,603
You can't fool me with such a trick!

282
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,804
You won't have your way with me, never!

283
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:01,503
And Eiji.

284
00:15:01,504 --> 00:15:03,403
That fellow is not my son!

285
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:05,003
Keep that in mind!

286
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,703
How can you say that! How cruel, Eiji just...

287
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:09,603
You hold your tongue!

288
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:11,703
Calm down, Mr. Nagakura.

289
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:13,503
The sake took hold of you.

290
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:14,703
That's right.

291
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:18,603
Cool down and have more hot sake, and you'll be...

292
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:20,304
Leave me alone!

293
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:32,003
I smell something.

294
00:15:32,004 --> 00:15:33,803
This village has something other than a ghost.

295
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:34,804
Yeah.

296
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:37,203
It seems worth investigating.

297
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,103
Right.

298
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,703
Was that a ghost?

299
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:43,104
That Mami...

300
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:05,404
"Otozawa" -The house of Otozawa.

301
00:16:06,204 --> 00:16:07,903
This is where Mami had been living

302
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:10,103
with her parents until 10 years ago.

303
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:12,803
She was the only child in the family.

304
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:14,904
Hey, Ayumi!

305
00:16:23,604 --> 00:16:27,303
Mami died of a disease.

306
00:16:27,304 --> 00:16:32,503
And then the parents moved out to some other place.

307
00:16:32,504 --> 00:16:35,103
Are there any photos left?

308
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:37,603
Maybe not, it's been 10 years now.

309
00:16:37,604 --> 00:16:40,303
We can tell if what Yoshida saw was real or not

310
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:42,503
with a photo of her.

311
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:44,503
That's right!

312
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,603
How well your mind works, Haibara.

313
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:50,503
Real? You mean the ghost?

314
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:53,403
Hey, you of all people start talking like that...

315
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:56,603
Don't you believe her, Conan?

316
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:58,003
Don't you know

317
00:16:58,004 --> 00:17:01,603
I'm the detective who is making his way with logic and reasoning?

318
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,003
There is no place for a ghost in...

319
00:17:03,004 --> 00:17:04,903
We're not asking anything of the sort.

320
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:06,003
What?

321
00:17:06,004 --> 00:17:11,303
They're both asking you if you believe in Yoshida.

322
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:12,904
No. I...

323
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:18,703
Ayumi!

324
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,103
You'll pay for this, Conan!

325
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:23,403
Geez.

326
00:17:23,404 --> 00:17:25,603
And now we go for Eiji.

327
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:27,104
What? Oh, yeah.

328
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:40,203
Suicide?

329
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:42,003
Eiji Nagakura killed himself?

330
00:17:42,004 --> 00:17:44,103
Yes. There is no doubt about it.

331
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,303
Since you asked me,

332
00:17:45,304 --> 00:17:49,003
I checked on Eiji Nagakura in the crime articles in the newspaper

333
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:51,603
and I found one.

334
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:55,503
It took place half a year ago

335
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:57,303
in the town of Shoujin.

336
00:17:57,304 --> 00:18:01,503
It's right next to this village you are staying in.

337
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:03,203
They found his fingerprints at the scene.

338
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:06,904
He was wanted and he probably gave up on running.

339
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,903
Eiji Nagakura is a jewelry robber who committed suicide.

340
00:18:11,904 --> 00:18:16,003
But his mother believes him to be innocent.

341
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:20,203
That's why the villagers were reluctant to talk.

342
00:18:20,204 --> 00:18:21,604
Conan.

343
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:25,703
I didn't tell a lie.

344
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:29,104
I really saw her, Mami.

345
00:18:30,304 --> 00:18:33,903
I want you to believe me, Conan.

346
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,803
So I want you to...

347
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:38,503
You want him to investigate, don't you?

348
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:40,103
Yes.

349
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:44,503
Of course he will do it for you and just for you.

350
00:18:44,504 --> 00:18:47,203
Haibara, are you serious?

351
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:49,503
Edogawa?

352
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:50,504
Sure.

353
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:54,503
This is one place that's eerie even in the daytime.

354
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:57,103
I saw her over there

355
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:58,203
and as if she wanted me to follow her,

356
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,903
we came to this Water God Shrine.

357
00:19:00,904 --> 00:19:02,103
Then...

358
00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:03,703
Then?

359
00:19:03,704 --> 00:19:07,503
What happened then, Ayumi?

360
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:09,103
She disappeared.

361
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:10,303
Disappeared?

362
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:13,603
Yes. She just disappeared into darkness.

363
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:16,903
And she never appeared again.

364
00:19:16,904 --> 00:19:20,803
I got tired of calling her

365
00:19:20,804 --> 00:19:23,704
and it seemed I went to sleep at the foot of the tree.

366
00:19:25,304 --> 00:19:27,103
Where did she disappear?

367
00:19:27,104 --> 00:19:28,304
Exactly where?

368
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:32,103
The mist was thick...

369
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,104
It was there beside the Water God Shrine.

370
00:19:45,104 --> 00:19:47,303
It's still new.

371
00:19:47,304 --> 00:19:50,803
It says "Tamai". It could be the inn across the street.

372
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:53,303
Oh. That's the story.

373
00:19:53,304 --> 00:19:56,303
This kimono was blown away by the wind.

374
00:19:56,304 --> 00:19:58,403
Ayumi saw it and thought it was the girl by mistake.

375
00:19:58,404 --> 00:20:00,903
What are you talking about, Genta?

376
00:20:00,904 --> 00:20:04,803
Clothes hung out to dry won't come flying this far.

377
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,703
It's not a mistake.

378
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:09,903
I actually saw her.

379
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:12,403
I believe you, Ayumi.

380
00:20:12,404 --> 00:20:16,203
It must be some coincidence.

381
00:20:16,204 --> 00:20:19,404
Hey. Are you insisting...

382
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:22,703
I saw him yesterday...

383
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:24,604
What is he doing?

384
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:34,204
Beware of fire.

385
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:38,604
Beware of fire.

386
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:46,703
Footsteps?

387
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,603
It's walking!

388
00:20:48,604 --> 00:20:49,903
So it really is a ghost after all!

389
00:20:49,904 --> 00:20:53,203
But a ghost doesn't walk on foot, Genta.

390
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:54,603
You're right!

391
00:20:54,604 --> 00:20:56,303
Then, it means...

392
00:20:56,304 --> 00:20:58,004
You two stay here!

393
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:03,003
We'll go with you.

394
00:21:03,004 --> 00:21:04,804
Then, keep quiet.

395
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:10,003
It's you.

396
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:12,203
All's well on this floor.

397
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,704
It's on the top floor.

398
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:23,904
Darn it!

399
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:31,403
Who is it?

400
00:21:31,404 --> 00:21:32,903
You!

401
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:34,504
What were you doing?

402
00:21:42,004 --> 00:21:43,604
Mr. Nagakura!

403
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,803
-Call an ambulance. -And the police!

404
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:50,203
-Yes, I will. -Yes, will do.

405
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:52,904
The culprit is not far yet.

406
00:21:56,004 --> 00:21:57,304
Ran!

407
00:21:58,404 --> 00:21:59,903
Oh, there...

408
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:02,803
Mami! So she was real after all.

409
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:04,104
Where are you going?

410
00:22:25,004 --> 00:22:26,203
It can't be...

411
00:22:26,204 --> 00:22:29,104
A ghost attacked Mr. Nagakura?

412
00:23:57,004 --> 00:23:58,503
"Next Episode" -I see.

413
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,703
If you insist,

414
00:24:00,704 --> 00:24:02,503
I, Kogoro Mouri,

415
00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:05,603
will give my best in this case.

416
00:24:05,604 --> 00:24:08,803
It can't possibly be a ghost.

417
00:24:08,804 --> 00:24:09,804
But...

418
00:24:09,805 --> 00:24:13,103
You saw Mami too, right?

419
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:15,803
Of course! That explains it!

420
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:17,203
I'm sure of it.

421
00:24:17,204 --> 00:24:19,203
The real culprit is that person.

422
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:21,504
The person who will show up at that place tonight.

423
00:24:21,904 --> 00:24:23,203
Next Conan,

424
00:24:23,204 --> 00:24:27,004
"Love, Ghosts and World Heritage (Part 2)"

425
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:43,904
Two, three!

426
00:24:43,905 --> 00:24:45,703
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:45,704 --> 00:24:47,003
"Loupe."

428
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:48,004
The next episode is the solution.

429
00:24:48,005 --> 00:24:49,203
Well, who is he?

430
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:50,303
Is he the big man?

431
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:51,704
The big man?
