1
00:00:00,172 --> 00:00:05,371
But poisoning someone who comes to visit you in the hospital.

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:09,372
To be honest, maybe this hospital is cursed.

3
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:12,271
There was rumor going round that an announcer named Rena Mizunashi

4
00:00:12,272 --> 00:00:14,771
was hospitalized here.

5
00:00:14,772 --> 00:00:17,871
Then wounded people avalanched in causing chaos.

6
00:00:17,872 --> 00:00:20,671
I also heard that there was a bombing commotion here too.

7
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:22,671
Officer Takagi!

8
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:26,771
Don't you have to return to MPD already?

9
00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:27,871
Oh, no!

10
00:00:27,872 --> 00:00:32,571
Then, you don't know of a man called Rikumichi Kusuda, do you?

11
00:00:32,572 --> 00:00:35,571
Rikumichi Kusuda?

12
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:36,572
Now that you mentioned it,

13
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:39,171
a few days before the bombing incident that I just mentioned,

14
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:42,071
a damaged vehicle was found near here,

15
00:00:42,072 --> 00:00:46,772
and the owner of that vehicle was a man called Rikumichi Kusuda!

16
00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:50,171
It was a case full of mysteries.

17
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:52,171
Inside that damaged vehicle a great amount of splattered blood

18
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:55,071
was found all over the vehicle.

19
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:57,571
Some of the blood stains were less than a millimeter across.

20
00:00:57,572 --> 00:00:59,571
-According to forensics... -Blood stains less than a millimeter across

21
00:00:59,572 --> 00:01:02,571
from high speed shooting.

22
00:01:02,572 --> 00:01:03,872
A pistol?

23
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:21,671
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

24
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:23,871
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

25
00:01:23,872 --> 00:01:25,571
A strange case occurs at Haido Park.

26
00:01:25,572 --> 00:01:27,471
A bright red secret starts to spill.

27
00:01:27,472 --> 00:01:29,071
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:30,971
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:30,972 --> 00:01:33,372
His name is Detective Conan!

30
00:03:17,412 --> 00:03:20,412
"Haido Elementary School"

31
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:23,811
Hello.

32
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:26,211
Oh, Jodie! What's up?

33
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:29,211
Oh, was it today that we were supposed to go drinking?

34
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:33,311
Have you already gotten used to being an elementary school teacher?

35
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:35,111
Yes. I'm really popular being their beautiful teacher

36
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:37,811
who returned from abroad.

37
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:40,011
"Natsuko Shibuya (28)" -Is what I'd like to say.

38
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,612
But it's really a hard work.

39
00:03:44,612 --> 00:03:48,511
I'm supposed to meet some parents today after this too.

40
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:49,911
I see.

41
00:03:49,912 --> 00:03:52,611
I guess we can't go out drinking tonight then.

42
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:54,811
No. I'm sorry.

43
00:03:54,812 --> 00:03:58,111
By the way, why are you still in Japan?

44
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,111
Your undercover investigation is over, right?

45
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:03,511
Hey, you're the one who invited me out for drinks.

46
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:06,911
I've got my reasons too.

47
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:09,111
Secrets on the job, right?

48
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:10,611
Right.

49
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:12,911
I'll call you again then.

50
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:14,311
Your friend?

51
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:17,411
Yes. When she was studying abroad in the US,

52
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:20,112
she got involved in a case.

53
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,511
I saved her back then.

54
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:25,311
And that's how I got to know her.

55
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:26,611
I see.

56
00:04:26,612 --> 00:04:29,611
She also taught me Japanese

57
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:36,111
and helped me go undercover as an English teacher.

58
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:39,211
I guess you could say she's my best teacher friend.

59
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,812
I see.

60
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:53,611
And? Who are you waiting for here?

61
00:04:53,612 --> 00:04:56,411
Natsuko Shibuya, age 28.

62
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:59,011
An elementary school teacher.

63
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:01,411
Who's that?

64
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:03,211
My client

65
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:07,411
as well as the one who can lead me to the last piece I'm looking for.

66
00:05:07,412 --> 00:05:11,211
A woman who could probably help me complete the puzzle.

67
00:05:11,212 --> 00:05:14,412
So, what is this piece that you're referring to?

68
00:05:18,212 --> 00:05:20,912
That sound just now sounded like someone fell down the stairs.

69
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,011
Hey, come on. Let's go!

70
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:50,112
I don't want to attract attention is a place like this.

71
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:52,611
She's...

72
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:54,011
Yes.

73
00:05:54,012 --> 00:05:57,512
I guess the puzzle'll be completed soon.

74
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:09,411
"The Scarlet Prologue"

75
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:13,511
"Teitan Elementary School"

76
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:14,911
Hey, Conan!

77
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:18,411
Let's play soccer on the way home.

78
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:19,412
What?

79
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,011
He's gone!

80
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:25,311
He rushed out as soon as the bell rang.

81
00:06:25,312 --> 00:06:27,012
Over there.

82
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:32,111
I wonder if someone came to pick him up by car?

83
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:34,711
I'm sure it's Pops from the detective agency!

84
00:06:34,712 --> 00:06:35,912
No, it's not.

85
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:39,111
That car is an expensive foreign car.

86
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:42,911
I don't think Pops would rent a car like that.

87
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:44,111
I see.

88
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:48,211
Oh, then maybe it's Ms. Jodie's car.

89
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:51,311
It's only natural for a foreigner to be driving a foreign car.

90
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:52,711
Come on.

91
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,811
Let's leave that deduction freak alone

92
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:56,111
and head home!

93
00:06:56,112 --> 00:07:01,111
Dr. Agasa said he'd buy a delicious cake for us.

94
00:07:01,112 --> 00:07:03,611
It seems Edogawa doesn't want any,

95
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:06,111
so let's eat it up ourselves!

96
00:07:06,112 --> 00:07:11,411
-Yes! -Let's do that!

97
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:13,011
Right.

98
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:16,612
That's definitely the car of the FBI that I've seen before.

99
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:25,911
Your priority purpose is to retrieve the transmitter and wiretap!

100
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,111
Don't hesitate because of unneeded curiosity and righteousness,

101
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:31,811
because then everything is lost!

102
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:34,412
Yeah. I know.

103
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:41,411
But, he hasn't cautioned me of anything,

104
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:43,212
which means something's come up.

105
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:48,511
Something out of my sight.

106
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:50,911
Ai!

107
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:52,711
What're you doing?

108
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:55,311
I'm hungry so let's hurry back!

109
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:57,212
Yep, I'm coming.

110
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,911
What kind of cake is it?

111
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:03,511
Let's eat it together, Haibara.

112
00:08:03,512 --> 00:08:04,612
Yes.

113
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,111
Rikumichi Kusuda?

114
00:08:10,112 --> 00:08:12,711
You mean the spy from the Organization that snuck into the hospital

115
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:14,711
where Rena Mizunashi was staying.

116
00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:15,712
If I remember correctly,

117
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:17,911
he fled after his identity was exposed.

118
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:20,211
After Shu caught and cornered him,

119
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:23,611
he shot himself in the head with a gun.

120
00:08:23,612 --> 00:08:24,612
Right?

121
00:08:24,613 --> 00:08:27,711
-Yeah. -What about that?

122
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:33,611
Please tell the people at the FBI to not leak this information.

123
00:08:33,612 --> 00:08:35,411
One of the guys of the Organization, Bourbon,

124
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:38,811
Tohru Amuro is sniffing around, you see!

125
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:40,511
Sure thing!

126
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:41,611
What?

127
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:45,011
Did you ask me to come pick you up just to tell me that?

128
00:08:45,012 --> 00:08:49,011
Yes because it's easy to wiretap a cell phone.

129
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:52,412
And I have something else I have to tell you too.

130
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:56,311
Maybe...

131
00:08:56,312 --> 00:08:59,911
Maybe that guy called Amuro is...

132
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:02,711
Three! Two! One!

133
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:04,212
Zero!

134
00:09:10,212 --> 00:09:11,511
Oh, sorry.

135
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:14,212
I'm going to pull over and answer it.

136
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:20,611
What? Natsuko's in critical condition?

137
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:23,811
She fell off the stairs in front of Haido Park?

138
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:25,411
What hospital is she at?

139
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:26,711
I'll head over right away.

140
00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:30,711
Oh, no, I'd like you to come to the crime site.

141
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:32,812
Crime site?

142
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:38,111
Yes. I'm at the place where she fell off the stairs now.

143
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:41,311
We found from the call history on her cell phone

144
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:45,711
that she talked to you last night before eight pm.

145
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:46,911
That's right.

146
00:09:46,912 --> 00:09:50,011
I called her just around that time.

147
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:51,311
Hold it!

148
00:09:51,312 --> 00:09:54,111
You mean she didn't fall accidentally?

149
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:55,112
No.

150
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:59,111
According to the person who reported it from a nearby phone booth,

151
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:03,011
it seems she'd been pushed down by someone.

152
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:06,411
Hello? Jodie?

153
00:10:06,412 --> 00:10:09,111
I'll be right over!

154
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:12,012
The place is the stairs in front of Haido Park, correct?

155
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:19,711
Jodie.

156
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:23,211
Camel? What are you doing here?

157
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:27,511
The cell phone you used to call her last night was mine, remember?

158
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:30,611
Because your cell phone needed to be recharged.

159
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:35,111
That's why the police called me first.

160
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:36,411
Because the phone history showed that

161
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:39,311
the conversation took place an hour before it was reported.

162
00:10:39,312 --> 00:10:42,011
What? An hour before?

163
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:44,511
You mean Natsuko didn't fall today?

164
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:47,311
No. She fell last night a little after nine pm.

165
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:50,311
No purse or cell phone was found among her belongings

166
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:53,111
so she was unidentified until after noon today.

167
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:57,011
But, we had a hunch that she could be a teacher,

168
00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:58,511
so we traced her from there

169
00:10:58,512 --> 00:11:03,111
and finally found that the victim was Ms. Natsuko Shibuya.

170
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:08,211
Then her phone was found disposed of inside the park

171
00:11:08,212 --> 00:11:10,511
so we had you come over.

172
00:11:10,512 --> 00:11:13,011
And how's Natsuko right now?

173
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:15,611
She's badly hurt with a dented skull.

174
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:19,611
She underwent surgery although she's still unconscious.

175
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:20,712
Is that so?

176
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:27,611
Natsuko was probably attacked by a mugger on her way home from work

177
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:31,111
and pushed down the stairs, right?

178
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:33,711
Yes. We're thinking on that line too.

179
00:11:33,712 --> 00:11:35,111
Excuse me...

180
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:38,312
How did you know she may be a school teacher?

181
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:42,511
Because there were a lot of test papers inside the bag

182
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:45,111
that was on the ground near her.

183
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:48,011
What? Conan, how come you're here?

184
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:51,311
We were taking a drive together.

185
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:53,011
Were those test papers still untouched

186
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,311
with no names or answers on them?

187
00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:58,411
Oh, no.

188
00:11:58,412 --> 00:12:02,511
The answers were already written in and graded.

189
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:07,711
I think there were papers that scored 100 too.

190
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:11,512
Then I think that she wasn't attacked here.

191
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:15,611
Because Ms. Kobayashi said that test papers

192
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:19,611
that are already graded can't be taken home!

193
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:23,711
She says it's to prevent leakage of private information!

194
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:28,611
There seems to be teachers who take test papers home to score them,

195
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:30,611
but if all the papers were graded,

196
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:32,611
she wouldn't have taken them home, right?

197
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:36,211
Which means she was attacked inside the school?

198
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:37,411
I get it!

199
00:12:37,412 --> 00:12:39,611
In order to make it look as if she was attacked

200
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:42,011
on her way back from school,

201
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,211
the perpetrator put whatever was on the desk into her bag

202
00:12:44,212 --> 00:12:46,711
to make it look that way.

203
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:47,911
When doing so,

204
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:52,511
the perpetrator without knowing put in the test papers too.

205
00:12:52,512 --> 00:12:55,011
Since she had a dented skull,

206
00:12:55,012 --> 00:12:57,711
she may have been struck with a blunt weapon.

207
00:12:57,712 --> 00:12:58,811
Yes.

208
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,511
The perpetrator must have thought that if she was pushed off the stairs,

209
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:04,811
the police would overlook the fact that she was struck.

210
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:07,511
Come to think of it, Natsuko said on the phone last night,

211
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:09,911
"I'm supposed to meet some parents today after this too".

212
00:13:09,912 --> 00:13:12,311
What? Is that true?

213
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:13,312
Yes.

214
00:13:13,313 --> 00:13:14,411
Okay!

215
00:13:14,412 --> 00:13:18,811
Check her call history and e-mails once again thoroughly!

216
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:22,011
The people she had promised to see last night

217
00:13:22,012 --> 00:13:23,811
are of prime importance!

218
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:24,912
Yes, sir!

219
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:32,132
"Haido Elementary School"

220
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:34,232
Inspector Megure! Here it is!

221
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:37,433
Luminol reaction from on top the victim's desk.

222
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:42,032
So the crime took place here after all.

223
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:43,332
And, what about the weapon?

224
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,332
It hasn't been found yet.

225
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,733
The perpetrator probably took it away when fleeing.

226
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:51,732
Last night,

227
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:53,432
were there any other teachers beside Ms. Shibuya

228
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:56,132
who remained at school?

229
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:57,332
No.

230
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,232
But Mr. Sugamoto...

231
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:03,432
Didn't you say that you were going to take Ms. Shibuya home?

232
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:05,032
Oh, no.

233
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:07,432
"Yoshiharu Sugamoto (30)" -Well, I thought it dangerous for a woman

234
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:08,732
to walk alone at night.

235
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:11,632
But when I came back here

236
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:14,032
to see if she'd be ready to go,

237
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:15,632
she wasn't here.

238
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:17,532
Around what time was that?

239
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:20,232
I think it was a little after 8:30 pm.

240
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:24,232
So I asked security to lock up and headed home.

241
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:26,932
Where and what were you doing till then?

242
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,732
I was in the PE equipment room organizing the equipment.

243
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:31,932
After all, I'm a PE teacher.

244
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:33,732
Excuse me.

245
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:36,932
Mr. Sugamoto, do you have a car?

246
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:39,632
Yes. I do.

247
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:43,732
But the engine acted up today so I came by train.

248
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:46,232
What class are you in?

249
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,632
You don't look familiar.

250
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:51,432
He's from another school.

251
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:54,232
He's here on a social studies field trip, right?

252
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:55,433
Yep.

253
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,032
Inspector Megure!

254
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,032
Thank you for coming!

255
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,932
These two people here are the ones

256
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:08,832
who had appointments to meet Ms. Shibuya last night!

257
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,632
I thought she was just seeing one parent.

258
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:12,432
What is going on?

259
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:14,732
Barging in on my company like that?

260
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,832
I don't know what's going on,

261
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,532
but please hurry it up

262
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:20,433
because I've got to prepare dinner, okay?

263
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:24,732
She was struck by someone last night,

264
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:26,932
carried over to Haido Park,

265
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:30,132
then pushed off the stairs.

266
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:36,432
Ms. Natsuko Shibuya who had promised to see you both here!

267
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:37,433
-What? -What?

268
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:39,332
And how is she?

269
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,132
Fortunately, the surgery went well,

270
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:43,332
but she hasn't regained consciousness yet.

271
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,832
Hey, hold it!

272
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,732
Don't tell me that we're suspects?

273
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:49,532
You've got to be kidding!

274
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,932
Anyway!

275
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:57,732
Will both of you please explain what you came to see Ms. Shibuya for?

276
00:15:57,733 --> 00:16:00,432
First, will you please start, Miss?

277
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:07,532
I just came to warn Ms. Shibuya not to seduce my son.

278
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,032
Seduce?

279
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:12,132
"Akiyo Ueno (39)" -I don't care whether she just came back from the States

280
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:14,532
but wearing a skirt so short,

281
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:20,032
it's only natural that my son would fall head over heels for her!

282
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:23,632
But I think that Natsuko is rather on the plain side.

283
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:27,732
He saying that he's going to marry Ms. Shibuya in the future!

284
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:31,332
I can't just do nothing and watch, can I?

285
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:36,132
Your skirt is quite short too, don't you think?

286
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:38,032
I'm not a teacher you see.

287
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:40,132
You were one before though.

288
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:45,532
At around what time did you see Ms. Shibuya?

289
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:47,732
At a little after eight pm.

290
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:49,932
What did she say back then?

291
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:53,432
She said she'd be careful from now on with a grin on her face.

292
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:56,832
I went home in about 10 minutes.

293
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:01,532
I didn't want to keep my son all by himself for too long.

294
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:05,932
I came to give that irresponsible teacher a piece of my mind!

295
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:07,832
"Fujiyuki Kandachi (41)" -She marked my daughter's answer wrong

296
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,632
saying that her handwriting was too sloppy.

297
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:11,632
I came her a little before nine pm,

298
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:13,032
but the school building was dark

299
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,932
and the gate was closed

300
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,932
so I didn't get to meet her!

301
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:21,832
Was it really because her handwriting was sloppy?

302
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,833
Yeah!

303
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:26,032
All the answers that were marked wrong were all correct!

304
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:28,932
She would've gotten a 100 if graded as should be

305
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:31,032
but she only got a grade of 60!

306
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:34,632
I don't think Natsuko would do something unfair like that.

307
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:39,432
Would you like me to show it too you my daughter's test paper then?

308
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,932
On top of that, she hired a weird detective too.

309
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:45,332
A weird detective?

310
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,632
Is that right?

311
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:47,832
Yeah.

312
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:52,632
I went after her so that I could talk to her

313
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:55,232
but I was suddenly grabbed by the collar!

314
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,933
It couldn't be helped.

315
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:03,032
She asked me to solve a stalker problem for her.

316
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:05,732
Bourbon?

317
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:08,532
I'm sorry I'm late, Inspector.

318
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:10,232
Did you call him?

319
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:11,332
Well...

320
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:15,832
His phone number was also shown on her call history.

321
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:20,333
And are those two over there English teachers?

322
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:26,032
No. They are FBI agents

323
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:29,332
and are cooperating with us with the investigation.

324
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,232
Oh.

325
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:34,432
The FBI?

326
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:38,532
In other words, the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States.

327
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:42,232
I see a lot about you on TV or in the movies.

328
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:48,532
Their investigators show up at crime scenes to steal all the credit,

329
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:51,132
smugly interfere with the investigation,

330
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:53,732
offend the local police and annoy the viewer.

331
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,432
What?

332
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:59,232
I'm not referring to any of you, though!

333
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:02,932
-I just happened to see what I talked of. -This guy...

334
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,633
This guy tried to kill Akai.

335
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:10,532
Camel.

336
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:11,632
Cool it.

337
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:13,232
You don't want him to find out that

338
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:16,232
the FBI knows that he's a member of the Organization, do you?

339
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,232
Okay.

340
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:19,332
What?

341
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,032
Then, you're saying that

342
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:25,032
you're the one who reported the incident involving Ms. Natsuko Shibuya?

343
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,232
Yes.

344
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,932
She had asked me to investigate on the stalker

345
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,932
as well as act as her bodyguard too.

346
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:35,632
I came to watch her as she usually goes home using the park

347
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,132
which is a short cut.

348
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:42,032
But, I didn't think she'd come rolling down the stairs of the park.

349
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:43,932
If I remember correctly,

350
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,832
when you called in to report, you said that somebody pushed her down.

351
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,632
Did you see the perpetrator?

352
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:52,832
Yes. I saw the perpetrator.

353
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,932
The silhouette of the perpetrator who was standing on the stairs,

354
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:58,732
looking down at Ms. Shibuya.

355
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,132
Unfortunately,

356
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,532
I only saw the perpetrator from inside the car

357
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,832
and since the perpetrator fled right away

358
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,532
so I couldn't make out the face.

359
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:08,632
Only the silhouette.

360
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:09,832
Yes.

361
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:14,532
After that I heard a car take off at the top of the stairs

362
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:17,932
so I figured the perpetrator carried her, who was unconscious on the car,

363
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:22,232
took her to the parking lot of the park near the stairs,

364
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:27,832
and after checking to see that no one was around and pushed her off.

365
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:32,132
My car was parked on the road but I guess the perpetrator didn't see it

366
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:35,532
because it was hidden by the trees.

367
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:38,432
Haido Park has unrestricted access

368
00:20:38,433 --> 00:20:42,232
but at around nine pm there is virtually no one there.

369
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:45,932
I believe it was just as Mr. Amuro had explained.

370
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:50,132
But why didn't you wait at the scene

371
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:53,132
until we arrived after you made the report?

372
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:56,332
If you did so, the case would've moved along more smoothly.

373
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,832
I'm sorry.

374
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,232
I had another client in my car.

375
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:04,732
Since she told me that she didn't want to get involved.

376
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,032
Are you saying that

377
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:09,432
you just left Natsuko who was critically injured out on the street?

378
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:15,032
Of course I left after confirming that the ambulance arrived.

379
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:16,833
Any problem with that?

380
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:19,432
Jodie.

381
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:21,232
Well...

382
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:25,932
I guess it's because agent Jodie was best friends with Ms. Shibuya.

383
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:27,332
I see.

384
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,232
You're friends.

385
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:33,732
If so, it could be the doing of someone

386
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,832
who has a grudge against the FBI.

387
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,132
You.

388
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:38,232
Well...

389
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:43,032
Why don't we go over the incident once more?

390
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:44,232
For now,

391
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:51,333
we know that those three got to or planned to see Ms, Shibuya last night!

392
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:54,832
Right!

393
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,832
We've got to find the perpetrator first thing.

394
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:00,332
The one who struck Natsuko in this teachers' room, knocked her out,

395
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:04,032
carried her to the park and pushed her down!

396
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:05,332
Right.

397
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:11,933
Then will you tell me about last night without leaving anything out?

398
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:47,832
"Next Episode" -So, this is the answer sheet in question.

399
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:51,232
It seems that we were the only ones who could decipher it after all!

400
00:23:51,233 --> 00:23:52,632
-"We"? -"We"?

401
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:55,132
Right?

402
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,832
Conan Edogawa?

403
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,632
The hospital just called.

404
00:23:58,633 --> 00:24:02,233
Ms. Shibuya took a turn for the worse and she's in critical condition.

405
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,433
Don't die!

406
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:12,533
