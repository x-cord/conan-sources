1
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,500
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,400
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,800
A composed and intelligent girl.

4
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,400
On the 4th grader who resembles Haibara!

5
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,300
An unexpected accident closes in.

6
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,700
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,500
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,400
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,900
Yaiba Kick!

10
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,200
See? I look like him, don't I?

11
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,100
Yeah, you look just like him!

12
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,500
Genta, stop talking and clean up!

13
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,200
Stop! So you've come, mole monster!

14
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,700
Masked Yaiba!

15
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,800
Hey! Genta Kojima!

16
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,600
Yes!

17
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,000
Hey, Genta.

18
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Stop playing and let's finish cleaning.

19
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,500
If you don't cut it out, I'm going to tell the teacher!

20
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,100
Although my appearance is that of an elementary school student...

21
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,600
even the teacher doesn't get me nervous.

22
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,800
Genta!

23
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, peacefulness is best I guess.

24
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,100
Let's finish up quickly!

25
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,700
Bad news...

26
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,200
Bad news.

27
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,700
It hurts.

28
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,500
Are you all right, Mitsuhiko?

29
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,400
What's the rush?

30
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,700
A case!

31
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,500
-A case? -A case?

32
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,400
A 4th grade girl disappeared!

33
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,500
-Disappeared? -Disappeared?

34
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,700
Yes.

35
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,900
Actually, her big sister and my big sister are classmates.

36
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,900
When I was small,

37
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,500
she used to come over to my house with her big sister to play.

38
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,700
That's how I got to know her.

39
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,200
But I suddenly got a call from her yesterday

40
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,200
and we promised to walk home together today.

41
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,100
So I went to her classroom a while ago...

42
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,800
and was told that she didn't come to school today.

43
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,400
Maybe she caught a cold?

44
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,200
That couldn't be!

45
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,800
I called her house, but no one answered.

46
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,400
And besides, she...

47
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,000
She told me that she wanted to ask us to do something,

48
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,400
so to please bring everyone along too

49
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,900
and go home together no matter what!

50
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,600
Everybody? You mean the Youth Detective Squad?

51
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,700
Yes.

52
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,400
She said she'd let me know the details on the way home.

53
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,400
She sounded really troubled and concerned.

54
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,400
What is her name and what is she like?

55
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,300
She's in 4th grade, Class A. Her name is Shoko Amemiya

56
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,900
and she has brown hair.

57
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,100
Brown hair?

58
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,700
That is a bit curly.

59
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,600
A bob cut.

60
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,800
Yes.

61
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,600
She looked a lot like Haibara!

62
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,400
It can't be...

63
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,100
"Super Secret School Zone (Part 1)"

64
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,500
Hi! Did you finish cleaning up?

65
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,000
Ms. Kobayashi...

66
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,100
Oh, boy.

67
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,100
And?

68
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,500
What's the school side saying?

69
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,700
Were they contacted by her family?

70
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,500
Well...

71
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,400
What are you talking about?

72
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,000
It's about Shoko Amemiya in 4th grade Class A.

73
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,600
Oh, Shoko Amemiya.

74
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,500
She was scheduled to be absent to begin with today.

75
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,300
She has to attend a funeral for an uncle who lives in Kyushu.

76
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,500
But on her way home yesterday,

77
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,200
she said that she was coming to school today and won't be absent.

78
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,200
So I was worried, too.

79
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,100
Maybe she changed her mind and decided to go today after all.

80
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,500
Her homeroom teacher, Mr. Hirayama,

81
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,200
was also saying that he thinks so, too.

82
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Mr. Hirayama?

83
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,900
Was there a teacher by that name?

84
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,200
I never heard of him.

85
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,600
It's no wonder you don't know him because he's still new.

86
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
He came in place of the teacher that got into a traffic accident.

87
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,600
Traffic accident?

88
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Well, I guess she'll be addressing all of you

89
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,300
this coming Monday during morning assembly.

90
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,400
Ms. Kobayashi.

91
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,100
When did that traffic accident happen?

92
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,400
This past Monday.

93
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Two days after their attempted assassination incident.

94
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,300
Were you able to get in touch with her parents who went to Kyushu?

95
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,700
I'm sure we'll be able to soon.

96
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,000
We made a call to the home in Kyushu

97
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,400
and the people there told us that her family should be arriving by sundown.

98
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Okay, I'm going to lock up,

99
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,500
so you children go on home.

100
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,600
Okay, will do...

101
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,000
After we stop off at 4th grade class A.

102
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,100
Even a dorky cap like this

103
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,200
looks nice when a really cute girl wears it. See.

104
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,500
Give it back to me!

105
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,700
Let's see...

106
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,900
So putting together the opinion of the class,

107
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,600
Shoko Amemiya is smart, good in all subjects, reticent and calm.

108
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,500
On the other hand, when the time comes when she needs to say something,

109
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,400
she is straightforward.

110
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,900
Although she is thought by some boys to be distasteful,

111
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,000
she was quite popular with girls.

112
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,300
She sounds just like Ai!

113
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,200
But in Haibara's case, she's also popular among boys.

114
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,300
Thank you.

115
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,300
Not at all.

116
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,400
By the way, Haibara,

117
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,000
why were you wearing a cap?

118
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,900
That's Conan's cap, isn't it?

119
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,900
It's good sometimes, don't you think?

120
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,400
Yes, very boyish!

121
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,800
It looks awesome!

122
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,600
What I'm asking is why are you wearing Conan's cap, Haibara?

123
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,900
Is there some kind of regulation that says she can't wear Conan's cap?

124
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,200
Well...

125
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,600
If that girl had the same kind of personality as Ai,

126
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,800
it's very unlikely that she would've been deceived by a weirdo

127
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,000
and kidnapped.

128
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,200
The possibilities remaining

129
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,800
are that she got involved in some sort of accident or maybe...

130
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,100
The new teacher that came is one of their members

131
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,900
and abducted her after mistaking her for me.

132
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,200
Idiot! Not much time has passed since then.

133
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,900
They're working too fast.

134
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,100
It's pretty slow for those people

135
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,200
if they figured out

136
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,700
that you're the one who set up the transmitter and wiretap.

137
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,200
Besides, this cap

138
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,500
is a protection in case that's what happened, isn't it?

139
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,900
Yeah. But if so,

140
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,000
why would it be the 4th grade homeroom teacher?

141
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,600
True. It is quite strange.

142
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,800
If it were them,

143
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,800
they would probably come directly into class.

144
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,000
But what bothers me

145
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,600
is her suspicious actions these past few days.

146
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,800
Yeah.

147
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,000
She seems to have avoided her friends after school and walked home alone.

148
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,700
Her friends say that she never told them the reason either.

149
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,200
Maybe she sensed some kind of danger.

150
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
No way.

151
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,000
If she did feel that someone was after her,

152
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,500
the more she would've stuck around her parents and friends.

153
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,000
She would've gone to Kyushu, too.

154
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,700
Yes. That's true.

155
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,600
It would be a different story

156
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,900
if she's the type that would keep all her worries to herself though.

157
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,800
Like somebody I know.

158
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,400
Talk for yourself.

159
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,100
Haibara!

160
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,000
Conan!

161
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,400
This way, this way!

162
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,700
"Amemiya"

163
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,400
This is Shoko Amemiya's house.

164
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,400
There were no traces of an accident here either.

165
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,600
I wonder where she went?

166
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,900
Maybe she's playing hooky and playing TV games at home?

167
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,400
She's alone at home today, right?

168
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,400
No one seems to be home.

169
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,100
I think we can get inside.

170
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,700
I came here before,

171
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,900
and saw where the key is hidden!

172
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,800
I found it.

173
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
I don't think we should...

174
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,600
Yeah, we shouldn't go inside without permission.

175
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,700
Please excuse me.

176
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,300
This is Mitsuhiko.

177
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,900
I'm not a thief.

178
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,200
Hello!

179
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,500
Nobody home?

180
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,900
I'm coming in.

181
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,300
Is it the girl to the very right?

182
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,700
Yes, that's right!

183
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,000
True!

184
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,100
She does look a little like Ai.

185
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,300
Talking about alike,

186
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,800
I think there was one other thing she had in common with Haibara.

187
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,900
Don't tell me that her voice resembled Haibara's, too?

188
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,200
Oh, no.

189
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,000
Her voice didn't sound like Haibara's,

190
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,800
nor did she make sarcastic remarks.

191
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,400
Well, I'm sorry.

192
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,100
Maybe she came home!

193
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,000
Who are you all?

194
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,700
Who are you?

195
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:56,300
I'm Shoko Amemiya's teacher at Teitan Elementary School.

196
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,700
My name is Bungo Hirayama.

197
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,900
I see.

198
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,300
You're her teacher.

199
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,100
You scared us out of our wits!

200
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Huh? You have a wound by your right eye.

201
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Yeah, I fell off the stairs this morning.

202
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,700
Your glasses are out of place.

203
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,000
The hinges of these glasses are broken.

204
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,600
I wonder if we can really rely on this teacher.

205
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,600
By the way, who are you children?

206
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,400
Do you live in this neighbourhood?

207
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,400
We're students at Teitan Elementary where you teach!

208
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,100
We're in 1st grade, Class B!

209
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,900
But what are you all doing here?

210
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,500
We're doing the same thing as you, Mr. Hirayama.

211
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,700
We got worried about her and came to look for her.

212
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,500
You know, Shoko Amemiya in 4th grade.

213
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,400
I knew where the house key was,

214
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,000
so we came inside on our own to confirm whether she was home.

215
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,100
I'm sorry.

216
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,500
But nobody's home.

217
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,900
I see.

218
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,700
Then maybe she went to Kyushu after all.

219
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,500
Did Shoko say she was going to stay here alone today?

220
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,800
Yeah.

221
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,300
But she mentioned yesterday that she was going to eat breakfast and dinner

222
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,100
at her neighbour, Mitsuike's house.

223
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,000
Then I'm sure she's there!

224
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,400
Okay, let's go then.

225
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,400
Let's go!

226
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,700
-Genta, wait. -Wait.

227
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,800
To Mrs. Mitsuike's house.

228
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,600
Shoko Amemiya didn't come?

229
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,500
No, she's coming over tonight.

230
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,600
I saw her heading off for school early this morning

231
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
with her school bag on her back.

232
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,100
It's an incident after all!

233
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,600
What shall we do?

234
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,700
Is something the matter with Shoko?

235
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,300
Shoko Amemiya didn't come to school today.

236
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,100
Didn't you get a call from school?

237
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,500
Well...

238
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,600
I went out shopping with some women in this neighbourhood

239
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,300
and just got home a while ago.

240
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,600
Besides, my husband is at work so nobody was home.

241
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,400
That's why I'm not sure if the school called or not.

242
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,300
But it really bothers me.

243
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,600
Shoko's family is in Kyushu to attend her grandfather's funeral.

244
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,300
I wonder why only she decided to stay behind

245
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,800
and have Mrs. Mitsuike take care of her.

246
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,700
I'm not sure. I don't know why,

247
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,300
but it seemed that she cried and begged her parents

248
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,600
saying that she didn't want to go.

249
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,500
Cried...

250
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,200
When I saw her this morning,

251
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,800
it looked like she didn't have much sleep, too.

252
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,000
Maybe she got into a fight with her parents?

253
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Did you notice anything else then?

254
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Something aside from the usual.

255
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Well, I called out to her and said, "You're going out early today."

256
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,800
Then she answered, "I'm going to the convenience store on the corner."

257
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,400
Convenience store?

258
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,500
She got into a fight with her parents and left home after all!

259
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,700
I see.

260
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,900
She wanted to get food at the convenience store!

261
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,300
Oh, no.

262
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,000
But she doesn't look like a student who would run away from home.

263
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,600
Who are you?

264
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,100
I'm sorry.

265
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,100
I'm Mr. Hirayama, Shoko Amemiya's homeroom teacher.

266
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,700
Oh, the new teacher.

267
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,600
Yes, I'm just substituting

268
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,200
until the teacher who got into a traffic accident recovers though.

269
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,800
If 30 minutes go by and you get no contact from me,

270
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,000
please call the police!

271
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
I promise I'll find her!

272
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,900
Who are you?

273
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,200
Conan Edogawa.

274
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,300
We're the Youth Detective Squad...

275
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,300
Here we go!

276
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,500
Yeah...

277
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,500
The elementary school student, Shoko Amemiya?

278
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,800
I'm not sure.

279
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,900
I just started working here as the manager just the other day,

280
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,900
so I don't know the names and faces of the children in this neighbourhood.

281
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,800
I can show you how she looks like.

282
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,500
She looks like this!

283
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
This girl came early in the morning!

284
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,000
-Really? -Really?

285
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,100
Mitsuhiko, when did you take a picture like that?

286
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,700
When we went into her house a while ago.

287
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,000
I took a picture at the front entrance with this cell phone!

288
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,100
And? Do you remember what she bought?

289
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,600
I think it was...

290
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,400
A plastic bottle of fruit juice,

291
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,500
a carton of milk,

292
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,100
and a small carry around cutter knife.

293
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,000
Juice, milk and a cutter knife?

294
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,300
She'll get hungry buying only things to drink, won't she?

295
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,000
I wonder if she was planning to make something at school

296
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,500
because she also bought a cutter knife?

297
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,000
Well, now we know that she wasn't planning to run away from home.

298
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Anything else that bothered you about her?

299
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,200
Well, come to think of it,

300
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,200
she was at the kitchen goods corner for a while.

301
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,000
I asked her, "Are you looking for something?"

302
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,400
But she didn't say anything and left to go to another corner.

303
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,500
What was she going to buy?

304
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,600
Maybe toothpicks?

305
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,300
Dad always tells me to go buy some.

306
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,800
It's not something you buy before going to school!

307
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,200
I mean she's not going to school with a toothpick in her mouth, right?

308
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,100
If it's about that girl, I told those children about her a while ago.

309
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,700
I see.

310
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,200
We'd better be careful of that teacher.

311
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,200
He's acting like he's a nice man in front of us,

312
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,300
but the instant we walked away,

313
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,800
he was glaring with a dreadful look on his face.

314
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah. I guess so.

315
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,100
What do you mean, "I guess so"?

316
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,800
Either way, our top priority now is to look for the girl called Shoko!

317
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,300
Oh, my!

318
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,500
It's you guys!

319
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,400
Officer Yumi!

320
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,600
The lady that rides the mini police motorbike!

321
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,900
What are you all doing here?

322
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,200
Your house is way on the other side, right?

323
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,300
I see.

324
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,300
Before Shoko Amemiya's whereabouts became unknown,

325
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,200
the last place she stopped over at was this convenience store.

326
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Yep. Did you get any reports at the police

327
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,200
of suspicious people or a traffic accident?

328
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,700
We didn't get even one today yet.

329
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,600
But we did get a load of reports of illegal parking.

330
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,200
What's illegal parking?

331
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,800
People parking their cars and motorbikes

332
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
in places they're not supposed to park.

333
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,500
It's a bad thing to do!

334
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,100
I'm on my way to check on illegal parking.

335
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,000
Then why did you stop over at this convenience store?

336
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,700
Did you get hungry?

337
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,000
No!

338
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,300
I came to buy a mask!

339
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,100
Do you have a cold, Officer Yumi?

340
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,000
I have to go to three place now,

341
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,400
but all three places require me to wear masks.

342
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,000
Does it smell terrible or something?

343
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,700
Yes, in two of the places.

344
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,200
They're near a trash dump.

345
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,400
There are people who threw their garbage

346
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,600
regardless of what day of the week it is

347
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,500
and it's become a feeding place for crows.

348
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
The smell of the garbage

349
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,300
that the crows have scavenged is so stink and smelly

350
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,500
that it's probably better to give a ticket for illegal disposing of trash

351
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,000
before issuing a ticket for illegal parking.

352
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,800
What about the other two places?

353
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,200
The second place is a warehouse,

354
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,600
and I don't know if it's the dust or what,

355
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,300
but every time I go there I can't stop sneezing.

356
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,000
I went there yesterday too, but ended up with a runny nose.

357
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
When I went there before I was just fine though.

358
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,400
And the other place?

359
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,500
It's near the house where my ex-boyfriend in my university days lives.

360
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,200
I really don't want to see him

361
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,000
because I sort of brushed him off in a ruthless way.

362
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,900
You're going to cover your face with the mask?

363
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,600
Was he such a bad person?

364
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,900
No, he was pretty handsome,

365
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,500
but too childish.

366
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,200
Who cares about my ex-boyfriend at a time like this?

367
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,200
You're the one who started talking about him.

368
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Well, those three places have Pachinko parlours and game centres nearby,

369
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,600
so many customers who could not park their cars and motorbikes

370
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,800
in the parking lot park their vehicles on the street!

371
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,300
Do you guys understand?

372
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,500
Yes...

373
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,800
The problem for now

374
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,200
is the girl whose whereabouts is unknown.

375
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,700
Will you please contact the police department and check one more time

376
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,400
whether there was an accident or something like that.

377
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Okay.

378
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,100
There are no traffic accidents in this vicinity here after all.

379
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,800
Then I wonder where she went.

380
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,500
Ai, do you have any idea?

381
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:02,400
If she was like you, maybe you can tell where she went.

382
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,700
I wonder...

383
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,300
Come to think of it, Mitsuhiko you said

384
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,100
that the girl and Haibara had one more thing in common?

385
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,900
I'm trying to remember really hard what it was too, but...

386
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,200
You're eating at a time like this?

387
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,800
What's the big deal?

388
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,300
I used my head, so I got hungry.

389
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,800
Oh, that's right.

390
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,500
Come to think of it, that girl went outside the store

391
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,400
and drank the fruit juice that she bought on the spot.

392
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,000
She swallowed it down in a gulp.

393
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,700
She must've been really thirsty.

394
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,000
But the store's near her house.

395
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,700
She bought fruit juice in a PET bottle, a milk carton and a cutter knife.

396
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,900
She then stops over at the kitchen goods corner.

397
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,600
Her personality resembles Haibara.

398
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,800
Maybe...

399
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,400
"Next Episode"

400
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,800
-Conan? -Conan?

401
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,300
Just as I thought.

402
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,100
Hey, are you sure she's in a place like this?

403
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,800
Could it be that Shoko was run over by a car?

404
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:59,900
Next Conan, "Super Secret School Zone (Part 2)"

405
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,700
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,900
"Predisposed to allergy"

407
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,600
What kind of allergy do you have, Genta?
