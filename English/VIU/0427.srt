1
00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:02,047
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,947
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:03,948 --> 00:00:05,347
A composed and intelligent girl.

4
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:06,947
On the 4th grader who resembles Haibara!

5
00:00:06,948 --> 00:00:08,847
An unexpected accident closes in.

6
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:10,247
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,248 --> 00:00:12,047
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:13,948
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:10,624
Yaiba Kick!

10
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:11,924
See? I look like him, don't I?

11
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:13,824
Yeah, you look just like him!

12
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:16,225
Genta, stop talking and clean up!

13
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:23,924
Stop! So you've come, mole monster!

14
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:25,424
Masked Yaiba!

15
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:27,524
Hey! Genta Kojima!

16
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:30,324
Yes!

17
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:31,724
Hey, Genta.

18
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:34,724
Stop playing and let's finish cleaning.

19
00:02:34,725 --> 00:02:38,224
If you don't cut it out, I'm going to tell the teacher!

20
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:41,825
Although my appearance is that of an elementary school student...

21
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:47,325
even the teacher doesn't get me nervous.

22
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:52,524
Genta!

23
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:55,725
Well, peacefulness is best I guess.

24
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:01,825
Let's finish up quickly!

25
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:06,425
Bad news...

26
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:17,924
Bad news.

27
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:19,424
It hurts.

28
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:21,224
Are you all right, Mitsuhiko?

29
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:24,124
What's the rush?

30
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,424
A case!

31
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,224
-A case? -A case?

32
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:31,124
A 4th grade girl disappeared!

33
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,224
-Disappeared? -Disappeared?

34
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:34,424
Yes.

35
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:38,624
Actually, her big sister and my big sister are classmates.

36
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,625
When I was small,

37
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:43,224
she used to come over to my house with her big sister to play.

38
00:03:43,225 --> 00:03:46,424
That's how I got to know her.

39
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:49,924
But I suddenly got a call from her yesterday

40
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:53,924
and we promised to walk home together today.

41
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:56,825
So I went to her classroom a while ago...

42
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:01,524
and was told that she didn't come to school today.

43
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:04,124
Maybe she caught a cold?

44
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,924
That couldn't be!

45
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:09,524
I called her house, but no one answered.

46
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:12,124
And besides, she...

47
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,724
She told me that she wanted to ask us to do something,

48
00:04:14,725 --> 00:04:16,124
so to please bring everyone along too

49
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,625
and go home together no matter what!

50
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,324
Everybody? You mean the Youth Detective Squad?

51
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:23,424
Yes.

52
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:26,124
She said she'd let me know the details on the way home.

53
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,124
She sounded really troubled and concerned.

54
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:33,124
What is her name and what is she like?

55
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:37,024
She's in 4th grade, Class A. Her name is Shoko Amemiya

56
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:38,624
and she has brown hair.

57
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,824
Brown hair?

58
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:41,425
That is a bit curly.

59
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,324
A bob cut.

60
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,524
Yes.

61
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:48,325
She looked a lot like Haibara!

62
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:56,125
It can't be...

63
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:04,825
"Super Secret School Zone (Part 1)"

64
00:05:06,025 --> 00:05:08,225
Hi! Did you finish cleaning up?

65
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,725
Ms. Kobayashi...

66
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,824
Oh, boy.

67
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:14,825
And?

68
00:05:14,826 --> 00:05:17,224
What's the school side saying?

69
00:05:17,225 --> 00:05:19,424
Were they contacted by her family?

70
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:21,224
Well...

71
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:23,124
What are you talking about?

72
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,724
It's about Shoko Amemiya in 4th grade Class A.

73
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:29,324
Oh, Shoko Amemiya.

74
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:33,224
She was scheduled to be absent to begin with today.

75
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:36,024
She has to attend a funeral for an uncle who lives in Kyushu.

76
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:38,224
But on her way home yesterday,

77
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:41,924
she said that she was coming to school today and won't be absent.

78
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,924
So I was worried, too.

79
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:48,824
Maybe she changed her mind and decided to go today after all.

80
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:51,224
Her homeroom teacher, Mr. Hirayama,

81
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,924
was also saying that he thinks so, too.

82
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:55,724
Mr. Hirayama?

83
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:57,624
Was there a teacher by that name?

84
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,924
I never heard of him.

85
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:05,324
It's no wonder you don't know him because he's still new.

86
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:08,325
He came in place of the teacher that got into a traffic accident.

87
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:12,324
Traffic accident?

88
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:15,324
Well, I guess she'll be addressing all of you

89
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:18,024
this coming Monday during morning assembly.

90
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:19,124
Ms. Kobayashi.

91
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,824
When did that traffic accident happen?

92
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:24,124
This past Monday.

93
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,124
Two days after their attempted assassination incident.

94
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:32,024
Were you able to get in touch with her parents who went to Kyushu?

95
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,424
I'm sure we'll be able to soon.

96
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:36,724
We made a call to the home in Kyushu

97
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:40,124
and the people there told us that her family should be arriving by sundown.

98
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:43,124
Okay, I'm going to lock up,

99
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,224
so you children go on home.

100
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:47,325
Okay, will do...

101
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:52,725
After we stop off at 4th grade class A.

102
00:07:30,225 --> 00:07:31,824
Even a dorky cap like this

103
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:34,925
looks nice when a really cute girl wears it. See.

104
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,225
Give it back to me!

105
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:39,425
Let's see...

106
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,624
So putting together the opinion of the class,

107
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:46,324
Shoko Amemiya is smart, good in all subjects, reticent and calm.

108
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:48,224
On the other hand, when the time comes when she needs to say something,

109
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:50,124
she is straightforward.

110
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,624
Although she is thought by some boys to be distasteful,

111
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,724
she was quite popular with girls.

112
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,025
She sounds just like Ai!

113
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:01,924
But in Haibara's case, she's also popular among boys.

114
00:08:01,925 --> 00:08:03,024
Thank you.

115
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,025
Not at all.

116
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:07,124
By the way, Haibara,

117
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,724
why were you wearing a cap?

118
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:11,625
That's Conan's cap, isn't it?

119
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:17,624
It's good sometimes, don't you think?

120
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,124
Yes, very boyish!

121
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,524
It looks awesome!

122
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:27,324
What I'm asking is why are you wearing Conan's cap, Haibara?

123
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:30,625
Is there some kind of regulation that says she can't wear Conan's cap?

124
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:32,925
Well...

125
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,324
If that girl had the same kind of personality as Ai,

126
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:38,524
it's very unlikely that she would've been deceived by a weirdo

127
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:40,724
and kidnapped.

128
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:41,924
The possibilities remaining

129
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:44,524
are that she got involved in some sort of accident or maybe...

130
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,824
The new teacher that came is one of their members

131
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:50,624
and abducted her after mistaking her for me.

132
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,924
Idiot! Not much time has passed since then.

133
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:55,624
They're working too fast.

134
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,824
It's pretty slow for those people

135
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:00,924
if they figured out

136
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:04,424
that you're the one who set up the transmitter and wiretap.

137
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:05,924
Besides, this cap

138
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:10,224
is a protection in case that's what happened, isn't it?

139
00:09:10,225 --> 00:09:12,624
Yeah. But if so,

140
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,724
why would it be the 4th grade homeroom teacher?

141
00:09:14,725 --> 00:09:17,324
True. It is quite strange.

142
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:18,524
If it were them,

143
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,524
they would probably come directly into class.

144
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:23,724
But what bothers me

145
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:26,324
is her suspicious actions these past few days.

146
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:27,524
Yeah.

147
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,724
She seems to have avoided her friends after school and walked home alone.

148
00:09:31,725 --> 00:09:36,424
Her friends say that she never told them the reason either.

149
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:40,924
Maybe she sensed some kind of danger.

150
00:09:40,925 --> 00:09:42,524
No way.

151
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:45,724
If she did feel that someone was after her,

152
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:49,224
the more she would've stuck around her parents and friends.

153
00:09:49,225 --> 00:09:51,724
She would've gone to Kyushu, too.

154
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,424
Yes. That's true.

155
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:55,324
It would be a different story

156
00:09:55,325 --> 00:10:00,624
if she's the type that would keep all her worries to herself though.

157
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,524
Like somebody I know.

158
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:04,124
Talk for yourself.

159
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,824
Haibara!

160
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:07,724
Conan!

161
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:10,124
This way, this way!

162
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,424
"Amemiya"

163
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:16,124
This is Shoko Amemiya's house.

164
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:20,124
There were no traces of an accident here either.

165
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,324
I wonder where she went?

166
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:26,624
Maybe she's playing hooky and playing TV games at home?

167
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,125
She's alone at home today, right?

168
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,125
No one seems to be home.

169
00:10:38,225 --> 00:10:40,825
I think we can get inside.

170
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,424
I came here before,

171
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:47,625
and saw where the key is hidden!

172
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,524
I found it.

173
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:54,524
I don't think we should...

174
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:58,325
Yeah, we shouldn't go inside without permission.

175
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,424
Please excuse me.

176
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:03,024
This is Mitsuhiko.

177
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:05,624
I'm not a thief.

178
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,924
Hello!

179
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:11,224
Nobody home?

180
00:11:11,225 --> 00:11:12,625
I'm coming in.

181
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:21,024
Is it the girl to the very right?

182
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:22,424
Yes, that's right!

183
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:23,724
True!

184
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,824
She does look a little like Ai.

185
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:28,024
Talking about alike,

186
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:31,525
I think there was one other thing she had in common with Haibara.

187
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,624
Don't tell me that her voice resembled Haibara's, too?

188
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,924
Oh, no.

189
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:38,724
Her voice didn't sound like Haibara's,

190
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:41,524
nor did she make sarcastic remarks.

191
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:43,125
Well, I'm sorry.

192
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:49,825
Maybe she came home!

193
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:01,724
Who are you all?

194
00:12:01,725 --> 00:12:04,424
Who are you?

195
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:11,024
I'm Shoko Amemiya's teacher at Teitan Elementary School.

196
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:12,424
My name is Bungo Hirayama.

197
00:12:12,425 --> 00:12:13,624
I see.

198
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,024
You're her teacher.

199
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,825
You scared us out of our wits!

200
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:22,524
Huh? You have a wound by your right eye.

201
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:25,525
Yeah, I fell off the stairs this morning.

202
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,424
Your glasses are out of place.

203
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:32,724
The hinges of these glasses are broken.

204
00:12:32,725 --> 00:12:35,324
I wonder if we can really rely on this teacher.

205
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:38,324
By the way, who are you children?

206
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,125
Do you live in this neighbourhood?

207
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:45,124
We're students at Teitan Elementary where you teach!

208
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,825
We're in 1st grade, Class B!

209
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:51,624
But what are you all doing here?

210
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:55,224
We're doing the same thing as you, Mr. Hirayama.

211
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:58,424
We got worried about her and came to look for her.

212
00:12:58,425 --> 00:13:01,225
You know, Shoko Amemiya in 4th grade.

213
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:06,124
I knew where the house key was,

214
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,724
so we came inside on our own to confirm whether she was home.

215
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:10,824
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:13,224
But nobody's home.

217
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,624
I see.

218
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,424
Then maybe she went to Kyushu after all.

219
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:22,224
Did Shoko say she was going to stay here alone today?

220
00:13:22,225 --> 00:13:23,524
Yeah.

221
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:28,024
But she mentioned yesterday that she was going to eat breakfast and dinner

222
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:29,824
at her neighbour, Mitsuike's house.

223
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:31,724
Then I'm sure she's there!

224
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:34,124
Okay, let's go then.

225
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,125
Let's go!

226
00:13:35,126 --> 00:13:36,424
-Genta, wait. -Wait.

227
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:37,525
To Mrs. Mitsuike's house.

228
00:13:55,521 --> 00:13:58,820
Shoko Amemiya didn't come?

229
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:01,720
No, she's coming over tonight.

230
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:03,820
I saw her heading off for school early this morning

231
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:05,820
with her school bag on her back.

232
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:07,320
It's an incident after all!

233
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:08,820
What shall we do?

234
00:14:08,821 --> 00:14:10,920
Is something the matter with Shoko?

235
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:14,521
Shoko Amemiya didn't come to school today.

236
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,320
Didn't you get a call from school?

237
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:19,720
Well...

238
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:22,820
I went out shopping with some women in this neighbourhood

239
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,520
and just got home a while ago.

240
00:14:25,521 --> 00:14:29,820
Besides, my husband is at work so nobody was home.

241
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:31,620
That's why I'm not sure if the school called or not.

242
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,520
But it really bothers me.

243
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:38,820
Shoko's family is in Kyushu to attend her grandfather's funeral.

244
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:41,520
I wonder why only she decided to stay behind

245
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:45,020
and have Mrs. Mitsuike take care of her.

246
00:14:45,021 --> 00:14:47,920
I'm not sure. I don't know why,

247
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:51,520
but it seemed that she cried and begged her parents

248
00:14:51,521 --> 00:14:53,820
saying that she didn't want to go.

249
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:55,720
Cried...

250
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:57,420
When I saw her this morning,

251
00:14:57,421 --> 00:15:00,020
it looked like she didn't have much sleep, too.

252
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:02,220
Maybe she got into a fight with her parents?

253
00:15:02,221 --> 00:15:05,220
Did you notice anything else then?

254
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:07,220
Something aside from the usual.

255
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:11,220
Well, I called out to her and said, "You're going out early today."

256
00:15:11,221 --> 00:15:15,020
Then she answered, "I'm going to the convenience store on the corner."

257
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:16,620
Convenience store?

258
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:19,720
She got into a fight with her parents and left home after all!

259
00:15:19,721 --> 00:15:20,920
I see.

260
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:24,120
She wanted to get food at the convenience store!

261
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:25,520
Oh, no.

262
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:29,220
But she doesn't look like a student who would run away from home.

263
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,820
Who are you?

264
00:15:30,821 --> 00:15:32,320
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:36,320
I'm Mr. Hirayama, Shoko Amemiya's homeroom teacher.

266
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:38,920
Oh, the new teacher.

267
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:40,820
Yes, I'm just substituting

268
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:44,420
until the teacher who got into a traffic accident recovers though.

269
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:48,020
If 30 minutes go by and you get no contact from me,

270
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:49,221
please call the police!

271
00:15:50,821 --> 00:15:52,821
I promise I'll find her!

272
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,120
Who are you?

273
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:58,420
Conan Edogawa.

274
00:15:58,421 --> 00:16:01,520
We're the Youth Detective Squad...

275
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:02,521
Here we go!

276
00:16:02,522 --> 00:16:03,721
Yeah...

277
00:16:06,821 --> 00:16:09,720
The elementary school student, Shoko Amemiya?

278
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:11,020
I'm not sure.

279
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:14,120
I just started working here as the manager just the other day,

280
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:17,120
so I don't know the names and faces of the children in this neighbourhood.

281
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:19,021
I can show you how she looks like.

282
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:21,721
She looks like this!

283
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:27,820
This girl came early in the morning!

284
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,220
-Really? -Really?

285
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:32,320
Mitsuhiko, when did you take a picture like that?

286
00:16:32,321 --> 00:16:34,920
When we went into her house a while ago.

287
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:39,220
I took a picture at the front entrance with this cell phone!

288
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:42,320
And? Do you remember what she bought?

289
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:43,820
I think it was...

290
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:46,620
A plastic bottle of fruit juice,

291
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:48,720
a carton of milk,

292
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:52,320
and a small carry around cutter knife.

293
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:55,220
Juice, milk and a cutter knife?

294
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:58,520
She'll get hungry buying only things to drink, won't she?

295
00:16:58,521 --> 00:17:01,220
I wonder if she was planning to make something at school

296
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:04,720
because she also bought a cutter knife?

297
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:08,220
Well, now we know that she wasn't planning to run away from home.

298
00:17:08,221 --> 00:17:11,221
Anything else that bothered you about her?

299
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:14,420
Well, come to think of it,

300
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:19,420
she was at the kitchen goods corner for a while.

301
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:22,220
I asked her, "Are you looking for something?"

302
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:25,621
But she didn't say anything and left to go to another corner.

303
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:32,720
What was she going to buy?

304
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:34,820
Maybe toothpicks?

305
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:38,520
Dad always tells me to go buy some.

306
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:42,020
It's not something you buy before going to school!

307
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:45,420
I mean she's not going to school with a toothpick in her mouth, right?

308
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:49,320
If it's about that girl, I told those children about her a while ago.

309
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:50,920
I see.

310
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:54,421
We'd better be careful of that teacher.

311
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:59,420
He's acting like he's a nice man in front of us,

312
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:01,520
but the instant we walked away,

313
00:18:01,521 --> 00:18:04,020
he was glaring with a dreadful look on his face.

314
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:06,220
Yeah. I guess so.

315
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:08,320
What do you mean, "I guess so"?

316
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:12,021
Either way, our top priority now is to look for the girl called Shoko!

317
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:15,520
Oh, my!

318
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:16,721
It's you guys!

319
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:19,620
Officer Yumi!

320
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:21,820
The lady that rides the mini police motorbike!

321
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:24,120
What are you all doing here?

322
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:26,421
Your house is way on the other side, right?

323
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:30,520
I see.

324
00:18:30,521 --> 00:18:34,520
Before Shoko Amemiya's whereabouts became unknown,

325
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:38,420
the last place she stopped over at was this convenience store.

326
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:42,420
Yep. Did you get any reports at the police

327
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:46,420
of suspicious people or a traffic accident?

328
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:48,920
We didn't get even one today yet.

329
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:51,820
But we did get a load of reports of illegal parking.

330
00:18:51,821 --> 00:18:53,420
What's illegal parking?

331
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:55,020
People parking their cars and motorbikes

332
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:57,020
in places they're not supposed to park.

333
00:18:57,021 --> 00:18:58,720
It's a bad thing to do!

334
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,320
I'm on my way to check on illegal parking.

335
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:04,220
Then why did you stop over at this convenience store?

336
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:05,920
Did you get hungry?

337
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:07,221
No!

338
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:11,520
I came to buy a mask!

339
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:13,321
Do you have a cold, Officer Yumi?

340
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:17,220
I have to go to three place now,

341
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:19,620
but all three places require me to wear masks.

342
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:22,220
Does it smell terrible or something?

343
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:23,920
Yes, in two of the places.

344
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:26,420
They're near a trash dump.

345
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:27,620
There are people who threw their garbage

346
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:29,820
regardless of what day of the week it is

347
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:32,720
and it's become a feeding place for crows.

348
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:34,720
The smell of the garbage

349
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:37,520
that the crows have scavenged is so stink and smelly

350
00:19:37,521 --> 00:19:40,720
that it's probably better to give a ticket for illegal disposing of trash

351
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,220
before issuing a ticket for illegal parking.

352
00:19:42,221 --> 00:19:44,020
What about the other two places?

353
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:46,420
The second place is a warehouse,

354
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:48,820
and I don't know if it's the dust or what,

355
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,520
but every time I go there I can't stop sneezing.

356
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:55,220
I went there yesterday too, but ended up with a runny nose.

357
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:58,220
When I went there before I was just fine though.

358
00:19:58,221 --> 00:19:59,620
And the other place?

359
00:19:59,621 --> 00:20:04,720
It's near the house where my ex-boyfriend in my university days lives.

360
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:06,420
I really don't want to see him

361
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:08,220
because I sort of brushed him off in a ruthless way.

362
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:10,120
You're going to cover your face with the mask?

363
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:12,820
Was he such a bad person?

364
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:16,120
No, he was pretty handsome,

365
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:18,721
but too childish.

366
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:23,420
Who cares about my ex-boyfriend at a time like this?

367
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:26,420
You're the one who started talking about him.

368
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:31,420
Well, those three places have Pachinko parlours and game centres nearby,

369
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:34,820
so many customers who could not park their cars and motorbikes

370
00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:37,020
in the parking lot park their vehicles on the street!

371
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:38,520
Do you guys understand?

372
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:39,720
Yes...

373
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:42,020
The problem for now

374
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:44,420
is the girl whose whereabouts is unknown.

375
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:48,920
Will you please contact the police department and check one more time

376
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:51,620
whether there was an accident or something like that.

377
00:20:51,621 --> 00:20:52,621
Okay.

378
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:05,320
There are no traffic accidents in this vicinity here after all.

379
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:08,020
Then I wonder where she went.

380
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,721
Ai, do you have any idea?

381
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:16,620
If she was like you, maybe you can tell where she went.

382
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:17,920
I wonder...

383
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:20,520
Come to think of it, Mitsuhiko you said

384
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:24,320
that the girl and Haibara had one more thing in common?

385
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:29,120
I'm trying to remember really hard what it was too, but...

386
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,421
You're eating at a time like this?

387
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:34,020
What's the big deal?

388
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:36,521
I used my head, so I got hungry.

389
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:43,021
Oh, that's right.

390
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:46,720
Come to think of it, that girl went outside the store

391
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:49,620
and drank the fruit juice that she bought on the spot.

392
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:51,221
She swallowed it down in a gulp.

393
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:55,920
She must've been really thirsty.

394
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:58,220
But the store's near her house.

395
00:21:58,221 --> 00:22:03,921
She bought fruit juice in a PET bottle, a milk carton and a cutter knife.

396
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:08,121
She then stops over at the kitchen goods corner.

397
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,821
Her personality resembles Haibara.

398
00:22:15,321 --> 00:22:17,021
Maybe...

399
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:45,620
"Next Episode"

400
00:23:45,621 --> 00:23:47,021
-Conan? -Conan?

401
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:53,520
Just as I thought.

402
00:23:53,521 --> 00:23:57,321
Hey, are you sure she's in a place like this?

403
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:08,020
Could it be that Shoko was run over by a car?

404
00:24:08,021 --> 00:24:14,121
Next Conan, "Super Secret School Zone (Part 2)"

405
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:31,920
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:34,121
"Predisposed to allergy"

407
00:24:36,521 --> 00:24:38,821
What kind of allergy do you have, Genta?
