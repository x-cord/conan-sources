1
00:00:04,703 --> 00:00:06,803
There are so many tangerines.

2
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:09,703
Take as many as you'd like today.

3
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:12,503
"Naoya Terauchi (30), Tetsuji's Son" -You're our only customers today.

4
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:14,103
There's no need for restraint.

5
00:00:25,803 --> 00:00:27,603
No!

6
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:28,603
Dad!

7
00:00:30,603 --> 00:00:32,903
"Tetsuji Terauchi (62)" -If you harvest them so carelessly,

8
00:00:32,903 --> 00:00:34,403
"Terauchi Tangerine Fields Manager" -you'll damage the tangerines.

9
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:36,703
We're sorry.

10
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,203
This is how you do it.

11
00:00:42,103 --> 00:00:43,303
Got it?

12
00:00:43,303 --> 00:00:44,403
-Yes. -Yes.

13
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:48,003
Dad, you don't have to say it like that.

14
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:50,803
These tangerines are my precious children.

15
00:00:50,803 --> 00:00:53,803
I won't let anyone treat them so carelessly!

16
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:55,903
That attitude is the reason

17
00:00:55,903 --> 00:00:58,503
people stopped coming to pick tangerines.

18
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:04,703
So this is what he meant when he said we were his only visitors.

19
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:11,003
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:14,803
My father can get nasty when it comes to tangerines.

21
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:16,503
"Nobuko Terauchi (58), Tetsuji's Wife" -Don't let it bother you.

22
00:01:16,503 --> 00:01:18,803
He's just an awkward man.

23
00:01:18,803 --> 00:01:20,703
-Okay. -Mom.

24
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:23,203
I'm heading back down.

25
00:01:23,203 --> 00:01:26,303
When you get there, could you send it up?

26
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:27,903
Sure thing.

27
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:30,203
Pick lots of fruit.

28
00:01:30,203 --> 00:01:33,003
I'll cook up something tasty for you later.

29
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:34,103
Okay.

30
00:01:40,703 --> 00:01:42,203
Is something wrong?

31
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:43,503
No.

32
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:48,103
I just haven't seen my mom in such a good mood in a long time.

33
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:50,003
Really?

34
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:52,703
Lately she's been arguing with my dad a lot.

35
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:54,103
She's been on edge.

36
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:57,203
Hey, don't tell them that.

37
00:01:57,203 --> 00:01:58,603
Sorry.

38
00:02:13,903 --> 00:02:16,103
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

39
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,303
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

40
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:19,903
The aroma of citrus fruit drifts through tangerine fields

41
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:21,903
in perfect picnic weather.

42
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:23,503
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:23,503 --> 00:02:25,403
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:25,403 --> 00:02:27,803
His name is Detective Conan!

45
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:14,799
"The Sun Sets Over Tangerine Fields"

46
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:23,121
We ended up picking a lot.

47
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:25,421
There's got to be a month's worth here.

48
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:27,921
Let's stop harvesting and head back.

49
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:33,421
Do we have to hike down the mountain carrying these?

50
00:04:35,421 --> 00:04:37,021
Don't worry.

51
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:39,121
We've got a convenient tool for that.

52
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:41,921
Hey, it's coming right now.

53
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:51,821
What's that?

54
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:56,021
An agricultural monorail for transporting crops.

55
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:59,621
There's no one riding it. Is that okay?

56
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:01,921
Yeah. It automatically goes up and down the mountain

57
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:04,521
when you activate the lever.

58
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:05,721
Automatically?

59
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:08,721
Once it reaches the work shed at the peak,

60
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:12,621
it automatically switches into reverse and returns to the shed

61
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:14,921
at the foot of the mountain.

62
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:19,921
Of course, it can be operated manually as well.

63
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:21,421
"Reverse, Forward"

64
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,621
That's really convenient.

65
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:27,821
Thanks to this thing, transporting crops has become much easier.

66
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:31,021
Let's load the containers onto the bed.

67
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:32,421
-Okay! -Okay!

68
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:41,221
We're finally finished.

69
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,021
Good work.

70
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:45,021
Kid, want to ride the monorail?

71
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:46,121
Me?

72
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:48,421
Since you have the opportunity, why not?

73
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:49,421
Okay.

74
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:53,521
I want to ride, too.

75
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:56,321
Unfortunately, it's overloaded.

76
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,421
Sonoko, let's go.

77
00:05:59,221 --> 00:06:00,921
See you at the bottom.

78
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:08,821
It shakes a lot.

79
00:06:08,821 --> 00:06:11,421
Hold on tight so you don't fall off.

80
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:27,721
These look delicious.

81
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,721
I've never seen a bunch of these dishes.

82
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:32,621
Try some.

83
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:34,421
Thanks for the food...

84
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:38,921
It's so good.

85
00:06:38,921 --> 00:06:40,421
I know.

86
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:42,921
Tangerines go with everything.

87
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:45,221
Yeah.

88
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:47,721
Of course they do.

89
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:50,721
My tangerines are the best in Japan.

90
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:53,621
I think you must be right. Right?

91
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,621
Yeah.

92
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:56,321
Oh, really?

93
00:06:56,321 --> 00:07:00,721
In that case, have some more of this and that.

94
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:03,721
He's acting really different.

95
00:07:03,721 --> 00:07:06,521
He's happy because you complimented his tangerines.

96
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:07,721
He's a simple man, right?

97
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:13,321
Hey, you'd better not be saying things you shouldn't again.

98
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:15,821
I was just complimenting you, Dad.

99
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:19,321
Don't be shy. Eat as much as you'd like.

100
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:20,921
Okay...

101
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,821
I'm stuffed.

102
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:30,721
Dad!

103
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:34,621
You found a buyer for the farm?

104
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:38,821
-Yeah. -Why didn't you consult me?

105
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:41,821
Don't worry. It's someone we can trust.

106
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:44,021
That's not the problem.

107
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:47,521
I was making my own arrangements.

108
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:50,921
Don't tell Nobuko about this.

109
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:52,321
Got it?

110
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,021
Why not?

111
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:56,821
Because she always takes your side.

112
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:59,221
She'd obviously be against it.

113
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:03,321
Then all the more reason for us to discuss this as a family.

114
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:04,821
I'm the head of this family.

115
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:08,621
I have the right to decide.

116
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:19,821
That's when we first started the tangerine farm together.

117
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:24,521
That's the first time Naoya harvested a tangerine by himself.

118
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:26,121
-How cute. -How cute.

119
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:28,421
"Terauchi Tangerine Farm" -This is when Naoya told me

120
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:31,121
he'd work on the tangerine farm.

121
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:33,921
I'm surprised you remember all that.

122
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:37,621
It's like your family's history. It's truly wonderful.

123
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:40,621
Things were really great back then.

124
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:49,421
Did something happen?

125
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:54,421
A lot happens to a family over a few decades.

126
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,121
Want to see more?

127
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:01,621
Yes, please.

128
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:02,621
It hurts.

129
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:05,921
It hurts...

130
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,721
Are you all right?

131
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:12,221
Yeah. It's nothing serious.

132
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:15,421
Maybe it's a frozen shoulder.

133
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,221
Sonoko...

134
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:20,221
It's fine. You can't overcome age.

135
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:22,121
I'll get it.

136
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:25,121
Get the third one from the right.

137
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:29,221
-Here. -Thank you.

138
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:31,921
That's me.

139
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,921
Well? Pretty handsome, right?

140
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:36,221
Uh, yeah.

141
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:38,021
Yeah, I guess.

142
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:44,021
How pretty.

143
00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:47,521
I can't believe this view.

144
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:50,421
I'm glad Ms. Nobuko told us to come.

145
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:51,521
Yeah.

146
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:59,221
It's dark.

147
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:00,221
Yeah.

148
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:04,521
This sound...

149
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,621
Someone must've come to pick us up.

150
00:10:11,421 --> 00:10:12,421
-Hey! -Hey!

151
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:14,221
Over here!

152
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:20,121
He noticed us.

153
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:29,521
He just fell, didn't he?

154
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:30,521
No way!

155
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,721
Conan.

156
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:44,721
I was watching from below, and it looked like my dad fell.

157
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:45,721
Dad.

158
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,721
Conan?

159
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:53,021
No...

160
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,121
Honey!

161
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:10,219
The deceased is Tetsuji Terauchi, the manager of this tangerine farm.

162
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:14,119
The cause of death was a skull fracture.

163
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:18,319
Most likely, he hit his head on a rock when he fell.

164
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:25,719
And you saw Mr. Tetsuji fall?

165
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:26,919
-Yes. -Yes.

166
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:31,619
Come to think of it, how did you notice Mr. Tetsuji fell?

167
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:38,019
I was making repairs near the sprinkler control panel.

168
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:39,919
Where is that?

169
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,219
It's near the base of the mountain southeast of here.

170
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,419
And?

171
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:50,119
I turned to look when I heard the girls' shouts,

172
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:52,719
and just happened to witness my father

173
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:54,619
falling from the monorail.

174
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:57,119
I see.

175
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:59,219
I was looking for ingredients for dinner

176
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,819
in the fields at the base of the mountain.

177
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:06,019
Like Naoya, I heard the girls' shouts.

178
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:07,619
I see.

179
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:09,619
Thank you.

180
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:15,119
Would it be natural to think Mr. Tetsuji lost his balance

181
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:20,219
when he let go of the monorail to wave to Ran and her friends?

182
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:26,719
But why was Mr. Tetsuji heading towards the peak?

183
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:29,219
I asked him to.

184
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:30,719
What do you mean?

185
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:34,619
I told Ran and her friends to go watch the sunset.

186
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,919
Since it'd be dark by the time they returned,

187
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,619
I asked him to go get them.

188
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:41,919
I see.

189
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,919
Hey, it seems like there's blood on the inside of his hat,

190
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:49,519
but there's nothing on the outside.

191
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,219
What about it?

192
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:53,319
Don't you think that's strange?

193
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:58,119
Mr. Tetsuji died when he hit his head on a rock, right?

194
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:00,919
Then normally wouldn't the rock

195
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:03,419
have left a mark on the outside of the hat?

196
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,019
You're right.

197
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,319
Maybe Mr. Tetsuji lost his hat

198
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:11,919
before he hit his head on the rock.

199
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,919
Huh?

200
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:16,919
Then when did the blood get on the inside of the hat?

201
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:19,619
That doesn't matter.

202
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:24,119
We saw the moment he fell.

203
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,719
Right?

204
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:26,719
Yeah.

205
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,519
So where is the monorail your husband was riding?

206
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,819
It should be at the shed at the foot of the mountain.

207
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:36,419
I see.

208
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,219
Then let's have the others hold things down here

209
00:13:38,219 --> 00:13:40,419
while we go check that out.

210
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,419
Yes, sir.

211
00:13:57,819 --> 00:13:59,819
Huh? Where did they go?

212
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:04,319
Mom. It's okay, Mom.

213
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:05,519
But...

214
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,119
You've got me.

215
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:25,719
There's nothing unusual about it.

216
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:27,519
It seems that way.

217
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:35,119
The number of containers doesn't add up.

218
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:41,619
Don't these containers...

219
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:45,719
There's nothing particularly suspicious about the incident,

220
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,919
so it's safe to assume it was an accident.

221
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,619
Indeed.

222
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:54,519
It's our fault for calling out to him and waving.

223
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,619
No.

224
00:14:55,619 --> 00:15:00,519
He shouldn't have let go of the railing while riding the monorail.

225
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:03,419
It's my dad's fault for not following the rules.

226
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,319
You're right.

227
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:08,319
He should've sounded the monorail's horn.

228
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:11,019
It's because he waved with his right hand.

229
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:16,219
That's it. I've figured it out.

230
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:21,719
It's safe to assume this incident was an unfortunate accident.

231
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:24,019
We should get going.

232
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,519
Sonoko?

233
00:15:33,219 --> 00:15:38,819
You're always such a tedious man, Inspector Megure.

234
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:40,219
How?

235
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:42,319
Sonoko, could it be...

236
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:45,619
There's something that I just don't understand.

237
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:47,219
What don't you understand?

238
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:49,019
Ran, do you remember

239
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:52,819
what Mr. Tetsuji did

240
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,519
when we waved to him?

241
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,219
What he did?

242
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:59,219
I think he raised his hand high into the air

243
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:01,719
and waved back at us.

244
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,019
That's it.

245
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:05,519
Mr. Tetsuji had a frozen shoulder.

246
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,319
Someone like that couldn't raise their hand high up.

247
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:10,919
Don't you agree?

248
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,219
You're right.

249
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:15,419
Is it true that your husband had a frozen shoulder?

250
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,619
Yes.

251
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:20,419
Mr. Tetsuji was probably

252
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:24,819
forced to wave his hand

253
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:27,619
by someone behind him.

254
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:33,419
But only Mr. Tetsuji was riding the monorail.

255
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:35,319
That person was probably hiding

256
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:38,019
in the bed of the monorail.

257
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:39,519
Wait a minute.

258
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,419
There's no space for anyone to hide.

259
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,219
Not now.

260
00:16:46,219 --> 00:16:48,019
What does that mean?

261
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:49,219
Officer Takagi,

262
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:52,819
there are footprints on the front of the monorail bed, correct?

263
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:54,919
Yes, I see them.

264
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:58,619
Judging by the footprints, they belonged to Mr. Tetsuji.

265
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:02,419
Could you place your feet in them and try sitting on the bed?

266
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:04,919
Here?

267
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:07,419
Huh?

268
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:12,519
How was he able to sit with his feet in this position?

269
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,519
That's right.

270
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:18,019
Perhaps there was an additional row of containers there

271
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:21,319
so the culprit could hide.

272
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,519
-What? -What?

273
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,419
Even so,

274
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,919
I don't think an adult could hide inside these containers.

275
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,319
Are you sure?

276
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:37,419
It's impossible.

277
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:39,419
Sonoko, do you still insist

278
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,219
the culprit hid inside a container?

279
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:46,119
Hey, look at what I found.

280
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:50,619
It seems to be a folded container.

281
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:54,119
What about it?

282
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:58,519
The bottoms and sides of those containers can be adjusted.

283
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,319
If you fold the bottoms,

284
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,919
three containers can be merged into one,

285
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:07,119
creating a space large enough for a person to hide inside.

286
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,419
Furthermore, if you leave the right side

287
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:13,719
that we couldn't see open,

288
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:16,119
it's even possible to make Mr. Tetsuji wave

289
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:19,219
from inside the container without anyone noticing.

290
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,919
I see.

291
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,619
Several similar containers were scattered around the tangerine fields.

292
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,019
In other words, the culprit

293
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:32,019
hid inside the folded containers and pushed Mr. Tetsuji,

294
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:36,719
then used the monorail's automatic return system

295
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:38,719
to pass before us

296
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,219
and return to the foot of the mountain.

297
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:43,819
Later, they exited the monorail,

298
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:46,419
and pretended they saw Mr. Tetsuji fall

299
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:48,119
when they ran to the crime scene.

300
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,019
I see.

301
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:53,819
So, who did it?

302
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:54,819
I did it!

303
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:58,219
Naoya, you...

304
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:02,619
I killed my father, put him on that monorail,

305
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:04,319
and pushed him so it would look like an accident.

306
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,019
I see.

307
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,019
You can tell us more at...

308
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:11,519
Wait! I'm the one who killed my husband!

309
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,719
-What? -Mom!

310
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,519
I hid the hammer I used

311
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,019
to strike my husband under the workbench.

312
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:19,919
If you examine the fingerprints on the hammer,

313
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,119
it should prove that I'm the culprit.

314
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:27,519
I found it!

315
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,719
Why?

316
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:30,919
I could ask you the same question.

317
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,219
Why did you try to take the fall for me?

318
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:36,919
Because it's my fault.

319
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,019
It's not your fault at all!

320
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:42,219
I'm the one who decided to kill him!

321
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:46,919
What happened between you?

322
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:51,419
I overheard them talking about selling the farm.

323
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,619
I thought he was doing it to repay the debt

324
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:57,219
he accrued fooling around with other women.

325
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:59,819
But that's not true.

326
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:03,219
I'm the one who suggested he sell it.

327
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:04,619
What?

328
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:08,919
We wouldn't survive operating this farm as one single family.

329
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:12,019
I recommended selling the farm

330
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:16,319
so it could be revitalized using new techniques.

331
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,719
Not realizing that,

332
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:21,219
I was desperate to leave this farm to Naoya,

333
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:23,819
so I...

334
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:28,219
If you'd properly discussed selling the farm as a family,

335
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:29,919
then this wouldn't have happened.

336
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,319
My father told me not to say anything.

337
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:35,519
He said my mother would never allow it.

338
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,119
He didn't trust me.

339
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,919
When I told my mother

340
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,319
about the plan to sell the farm on the way to the shed,

341
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,719
she suddenly started crying.

342
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:46,119
When I asked her about it,

343
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:50,119
she confessed that she'd killed my father.

344
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:53,319
If only it'd been written off as an accident.

345
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,119
But if my mom was a suspect...

346
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,419
I know it was a misunderstanding,

347
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:01,019
but she killed my father to help me.

348
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:05,119
That's why I decided to take the fall.

349
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,519
I shouldn't have told you no matter what you said.

350
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,319
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:17,319
I'm sorry for using you as witnesses.

352
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,719
I'm sorry.

353
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,219
These are so good.

354
00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:48,019
They taste better since we picked them ourselves.

355
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,619
Ran?

356
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,119
Don't worry.

357
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,619
Naoya said he'd protect the tangerines.

358
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:57,019
Let's eat.

359
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:58,919
Okay.

360
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,819
Maybe you shouldn't eat so many at once.

361
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:02,919
It's fine.

362
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:04,619
Tangerines are low in calories

363
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:06,919
so I won't get fat no matter how many I eat.

364
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,719
Haven't you heard the expression,

365
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:12,219
"Fruit is gold in the morning, silver at noon, and lead at night?"

366
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:14,119
What's that?

367
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:18,219
Your liver turns excess sugar into fat.

368
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:22,719
That's why they say not too eat to much fruit.

369
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:26,019
People tend not to exercise at night.

370
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:30,419
Hey, you should've mentioned something that important sooner!

371
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:35,119
My stomach feels squishier than usual.

372
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:36,619
Ran.

373
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:40,819
It won't turn into fat that quickly.

374
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,119
"Next Episode" -You want to use the APTX 4869 antidote

375
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:49,119
to restore your body so you can participate, right?

376
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,919
I knew you'd understand, Haibara.

377
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:52,319
No.

378
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,519
What?

379
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,019
Wait, wait.

380
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:58,919
BIG might've won if Higo were in the game.

381
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:02,219
Chiyari City?

382
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:04,119
It's recording.

383
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:09,119
Next Conan,

384
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,119
