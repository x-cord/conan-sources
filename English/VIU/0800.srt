1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,579
Please wait, Detective!

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,179
I'm still not convinced.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,479
Ms. Tanaka.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,679
But don't you agree?

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,579
The abductor said, "Don't contact the police.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,080
Because if you do, the child is dead."

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,779
If the abductor finds out

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,279
that there is a GP whatever in the bag and on the car,

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,879
God knows what he will do with the child!

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,379
Don't you think so too, Mrs. Saeki?

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,179
Yes, but...

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,579
Ms. Tanaka, I perfectly understand how you feel.

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,079
We, as much as you do,

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,779
are intent on getting Reina back safely.

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,779
We ask for your cooperation in order to stay ahead of the perp.

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,080
Suzuko, please do as the police say.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,179
I understand.

18
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,279
Listen. This cash is to be exchanged for Reina, understand?

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,479
If they say, "We'll return the hostage later,"

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,879
don't give them anything!

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,479
No way!

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,879
If I refuse, who knows what the perp will do to Reina.

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,479
You don't have to refuse.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,479
Just give it to him without resisting.

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,379
Hey, Detective!

26
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,779
You remark so simply because it's not your money,

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,179
but it's 100 million, you know? 100 million!

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,579
I can't afford the cash being taken

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,379
and not getting my daughter back either.

30
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,079
But the perp is also human.

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,380
I'm sure he'll understand our sincerity and give her back to us.

32
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,379
But is the house maid going to do okay

33
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,679
as the transporter of the ransom?

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,979
I hope she doesn't go along

35
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,180
all the way with the perp and then be thrown out.

36
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,479
Okay. I'll be on my way, then.

37
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,880
We're counting on you!

38
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,479
Madam.

39
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,279
There's dust on your sleeve.

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,580
Thank you.

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,979
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

42
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,179
Love and cases come from the same origin.

43
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,979
The ransom for an abduction.

44
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,979
Ends up in an unexpected place.

45
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,679
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,679
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,880
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:04,032
"Chase the Hundred Million Yen."

49
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:12,490
I have your daughter Reina.

50
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:16,690
If you want her back, one hour from now at 10 am,

51
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:19,590
have Ms. Suzuko Tanaka bring 100 million yen

52
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:23,591
and come by herself to Beika Central Park.

53
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:28,391
If you contact the police, your child is dead.

54
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:31,790
The car is moving smoothly.

55
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,390
It'll arrive there in five minutes.

56
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:35,990
Copy.

57
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:39,890
There are currently no suspicious movements or characters for now.

58
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:43,491
Okay! I want to confirm one more time.

59
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,790
If the perp appears together with the hostage,

60
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:51,390
rescue the hostage and arrest the perp.

61
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:55,290
If the perp appears alone, make no move.

62
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,990
Let him go and go after...

63
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:58,690
Let him go?

64
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:01,290
Detective, what's going to happen to my 100 million yen?

65
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,690
Please calm down, Mr. Saeki.

66
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:06,390
Let the specialists handle it.

67
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:08,990
We've already taken all the measures necessary.

68
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,390
Please leave it to us.

69
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:15,890
A transmitter is inside the bag that the 100 million yen is in

70
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:17,990
and it's set up on the car, too.

71
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:22,490
There's one set up in the broche that Suzuko is wearing, too.

72
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:24,890
So we are aware of the movements of the perp

73
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,191
no matter what it may be.

74
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:29,290
Yes, this is Tanaka.

75
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:32,590
Yes, I've just arrived at the park.

76
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:34,390
The money is ready.

77
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:37,090
Is Reina okay?

78
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:41,790
What? The name of Reina's ballet teacher and her birthday?

79
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,091
Why does the perp want to know something like that for?

80
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,990
He's confirming whether Suzuko is really who she is.

81
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:53,690
Her teacher's name is Miyuki Ishikawa.

82
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:55,590
And I think I've heard in the past

83
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:58,691
that her birthday was on Valentine's Day.

84
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,590
The sandbox?

85
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:07,390
Yes. Dig the west corner of the sandbox?

86
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:08,891
The sandbox?

87
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,690
I found it.

88
00:06:25,691 --> 00:06:26,991
I found it!

89
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:32,391
Yes, I have the map.

90
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:36,091
The open lot in Haido-cho?

91
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:43,490
It seems that the perp has a station wagon

92
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:45,990
and new bag waiting at the open lot in Haido-cho.

93
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:48,090
He's going to make her switch the bag

94
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:50,090
with the ransom inside and the car here.

95
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:54,190
The perp probably knows that the police had been contacted

96
00:06:54,191 --> 00:06:56,390
and therefore, is on the look out for transmitters.

97
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:59,590
Darn it! What a smart guy.

98
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:04,490
Everyone, rush over to the open lot and put on the transmitter

99
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,490
where the station wagon and the bag is.

100
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:10,891
You've got to complete the job before Suzuko arrives there.

101
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:28,191
The open lot is over there.

102
00:07:29,891 --> 00:07:31,690
That's...

103
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:34,790
Inspector! It's dangerous for the investigators to go near the car!

104
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,390
Dangerous? Just what do you mean?

105
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:38,591
Please take a look!

106
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,990
There are no covers around the car in question!

107
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:45,290
The movements of the investigators

108
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,990
are in clear view from the surroundings.

109
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:48,590
Got you!

110
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:50,690
Everybody, stay away from the car.

111
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:52,690
Wait until further orders!

112
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:57,090
So we cannot use the transmitters in the bag and on the car now.

113
00:07:57,091 --> 00:07:58,990
Pops.

114
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:02,990
I wonder how the perp plans to transport the ransom?

115
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:05,890
100 million yen is pretty heavy, isn't it?

116
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:09,690
It's only about 10 kilograms, right?

117
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:12,990
With a car prepared, it's no big deal.

118
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:16,390
But if he's the type of perp who's concerned about transmitters,

119
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:18,090
I'm sure that he'll come up with the idea

120
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:20,691
of the police taking down the numbers of the bill.

121
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:23,790
Well...

122
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,090
There are security cameras everywhere now.

123
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:30,291
So if such bills are used, it'll be exposed immediately, right?

124
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,090
Inspector! This is Takagi!

125
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:36,890
Suzuko has finished moving the ransom into the new bag

126
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,691
and will start off in the station wagon.

127
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:53,390
Hello?

128
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:57,390
You know the Matsubara Jewelry Store in Kuin-cho, don't you?

129
00:08:57,391 --> 00:09:00,690
The Matsubara Jewelry Store in Kuin-cho?

130
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:02,490
Yes, I do.

131
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:07,990
Then use the ransom to buy diamonds.

132
00:09:07,991 --> 00:09:09,690
Worth 100 million yen.

133
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:13,291
What? You want me to buy 100 million yen worth of diamonds?

134
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:16,490
I see.

135
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:19,590
He's planning to exchange the cash for diamonds.

136
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:21,590
But can I just go there suddenly

137
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:24,090
and buy 100 million yen worth of diamonds?

138
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:25,790
Don't worry.

139
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:30,890
I've ordered 10 pieces of diamonds under President Saeki's name.

140
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:34,690
Don't be ridiculous! I haven't order it!

141
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:37,091
I'll contact you again then.

142
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:42,890
That perp really thought it out.

143
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:46,090
With 10 pieces of diamonds, he can easily hide it in his pocket

144
00:09:46,091 --> 00:09:48,490
or exchange it for cash.

145
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:52,390
And moreover, he can change it to cash with unrecorded numbers.

146
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,190
Let's contact the jewelry store

147
00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:56,590
and ask them not to sell the diamonds.

148
00:09:56,591 --> 00:09:58,590
No can do.

149
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:01,191
We shouldn't go against what the perp says.

150
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:05,890
I tell you that idiot Matsubara.

151
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:08,990
I mean it's not like I just got to know him.

152
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:11,590
It's 100 million, you know? 100 million!

153
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:14,090
I'm trying to make good business with him all the time.

154
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:17,291
The least he could do was confirm it with me.

155
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:22,090
Be careful, please.

156
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:24,490
Because it's not cheap, you see.

157
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,590
Yes.

158
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:30,290
Please give my regards to President Saeki.

159
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,291
Thank you very much.

160
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:42,090
Hello?

161
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,990
Did you buy the diamonds?

162
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:47,691
Yes. 10 diamonds about the size of the tip of my little finger.

163
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,590
What should I do now?

164
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:54,790
Go slowly down Sakura Blvd.

165
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,590
And turn left at the first light.

166
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,590
Turn left on the first light, right?

167
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:02,091
Okay.

168
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:05,590
What's up ahead?

169
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:07,490
The Tohto Central Station.

170
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:09,190
Private Railway TR

171
00:11:09,191 --> 00:11:12,790
is a terminal station where they have subways and such.

172
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,790
There are more than enough escape routes here.

173
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,991
He could also take the long distance bus.

174
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:23,790
All officers head for Tohto Central Station on the double!

175
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:28,291
At this point, the info that Suzuko is giving us is all we can go on.

176
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:34,890
What? I'm not going to Tohto Central Station?

177
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:36,590
Where to, then?

178
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:38,190
Please tell me.

179
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:42,390
What's the matter? What are you so flustered about?

180
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:44,190
No, it's nothing.

181
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:48,590
I just want to see Reina as soon as possible.

182
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,090
I see.

183
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:54,790
I'd like to release Reina as soon as possible, too.

184
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,290
However...

185
00:11:56,291 --> 00:12:00,291
Ms. Tanaka, you're wearing a microphone on you, aren't you?

186
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:05,590
I already know about it.

187
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:09,090
You keep repeating everything I tell you.

188
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:11,890
At first, I thought you were repeating what I was saying to confirm

189
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:14,690
but it seems unlikely now.

190
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:21,290
You're giving the police a detailed account of everything, correct?

191
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,190
No, I would never.

192
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:27,190
I haven't told the police, just as I've promised.

193
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:29,190
I think a microphone is embedded in the broche

194
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:31,791
you are wearing on your chest.

195
00:12:36,691 --> 00:12:38,590
I've been watching you with my binoculars from the start

196
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,690
and have been concerned about it.

197
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:42,790
If you want me to return Reina to you,

198
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,790
please throw it out of the car window.

199
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:49,090
In order for the transaction between you and I to go smoothly,

200
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:51,990
the police are a bother.

201
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:53,890
I understand.

202
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:55,191
Suzuko!

203
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:59,791
Darn it! She broke it!

204
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,591
She's not answering her cell phone either.

205
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,367
Inspector Megure!

206
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:27,267
What? You lost track of her?

207
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:32,067
Yes. The perp seems to have had a bike prepared beforehand

208
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:34,767
and Suzuko rode it and went from alley to alley.

209
00:13:34,768 --> 00:13:38,067
What I feared has happened.

210
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,167
It seems that I've lost sensible judgment

211
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:43,168
for being too intent on wanting to rescue the hostage.

212
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:46,767
100 million yen worth of jewels.

213
00:13:46,768 --> 00:13:49,167
I wonder where she took it?

214
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:53,767
Of course. Where else but to the abductor.

215
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:56,867
What if the abductor and Suzuko are in this together?

216
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:59,367
What?

217
00:13:59,368 --> 00:14:03,267
Then, she could've fled along with the 100 million yen worth of jewels.

218
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:07,067
Which means that we've been deceived since yesterday's abduction?

219
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:09,068
It can't be.

220
00:14:38,468 --> 00:14:39,468
Madam!

221
00:14:40,968 --> 00:14:44,167
Sonny. What brings you here?

222
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:45,567
The diamonds.

223
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:46,867
Where are the diamonds?

224
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:48,467
What?

225
00:14:48,468 --> 00:14:52,367
I was told to put them in a bottle with a red ribbon around it

226
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:55,267
and throw it in the river.

227
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:57,867
Is that what the perp told you to do?

228
00:14:57,868 --> 00:15:02,067
Yes. He told me to come to this wharf, so I came.

229
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,367
A bottle with a red ribbon around it was here.

230
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:08,467
So I did as I was told.

231
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:12,168
And did you notice anything else different?

232
00:15:13,668 --> 00:15:15,867
Now that you mentioned it. For some reason,

233
00:15:15,868 --> 00:15:19,367
there were many ants on that bottle that was washed clean.

234
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:21,868
-Ants? -Right, a lot of ants.

235
00:15:24,468 --> 00:15:28,167
Madam, I think you should contact the police quickly

236
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:31,067
because they're worried about you.

237
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:32,568
That's right.

238
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:42,867
I see.

239
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:44,768
So that's the story.

240
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:05,068
Reina! Reina!

241
00:16:20,868 --> 00:16:22,668
Champagne.

242
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:27,568
You're in a good mood, sir.

243
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:32,867
Did something good happen?

244
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,967
What do you want, sonny?

245
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:37,067
What are you doing here?

246
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:41,367
Sir. Do you know that there was a kidnapping case today?

247
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:45,168
No. Maybe that news was on TV?

248
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:51,668
Nope. I don't think any station is airing it yet.

249
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:59,667
Put jewels in a bottle and drop it in the river.

250
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:01,867
Yes, that's right.

251
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:05,067
And? Was Reina rescued?

252
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:08,067
Yes, she was released by sundown.

253
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,767
That's good to hear.

254
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:11,367
If the ransom money was taken

255
00:17:11,368 --> 00:17:14,067
and Reina didn't come back either...

256
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:16,267
Well, it's not that great though.

257
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,767
What?

258
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:19,167
Well, you see.

259
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:22,268
I brought the bottle with the jewels inside with me.

260
00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:26,967
Inside...

261
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:29,168
there are 10 diamonds, too.

262
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,367
But it's strange, isn't it?

263
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:36,967
I wonder why the perp let Reina go

264
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:39,067
despite not getting hold of the diamonds yet?

265
00:17:39,068 --> 00:17:41,767
Beats me. I wonder why?

266
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:44,967
There's one other thing that's strange.

267
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:47,367
You couldn't possibly buy 10 diamonds this big

268
00:17:47,368 --> 00:17:49,867
for 100 million yen, could you?

269
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:53,367
I'm sure these diamonds are fake.

270
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:54,767
I see.

271
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:56,967
That housemaid called Suzuko

272
00:17:56,968 --> 00:17:59,667
must've switched the diamonds for fake ones.

273
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:02,267
I'm sure Suzuko is in this with the perp.

274
00:18:02,268 --> 00:18:04,567
That's why Reina was released.

275
00:18:04,568 --> 00:18:06,867
-Wrong. -What?

276
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:10,067
If Suzuko was in this together with the perp,

277
00:18:10,068 --> 00:18:14,567
she wouldn't have to prepare all this fake stuff.

278
00:18:14,568 --> 00:18:17,267
"I handed the diamonds over to the perp."

279
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:19,667
That's all she has to say.

280
00:18:19,668 --> 00:18:22,067
That's true.

281
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,967
Then, who on earth?

282
00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:26,767
Come on, you're playing dumb.

283
00:18:26,768 --> 00:18:29,067
You're the one who sold her these glass balls

284
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:31,467
for 100 million yen, right?

285
00:18:31,468 --> 00:18:35,167
Owner of the Matsubara Jewelry Store,

286
00:18:35,168 --> 00:18:37,568
Mr. Akira Matsubara.

287
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:42,767
Don't be ridiculous.

288
00:18:42,768 --> 00:18:44,967
It's true that I gave the 100 million yen diamonds

289
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:46,467
to that housemaid called Suzuko...

290
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:49,367
There were two reasons why you chose Suzuko

291
00:18:49,368 --> 00:18:52,367
to transport the ransom for you.

292
00:18:52,368 --> 00:18:59,367
One reason was because Reina was the apple of her eye.

293
00:18:59,368 --> 00:19:01,067
So you thought that she'd do anything,

294
00:19:01,068 --> 00:19:04,867
and you told her to do it for Reina.

295
00:19:04,868 --> 00:19:06,967
And the other reason was,

296
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:11,367
in case you chose the rich Mr. Saeki or his wife as the transporters,

297
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:15,267
they would readily find out that the diamonds are fake.

298
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:18,167
As to that housemaid Suzuko,

299
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:21,267
she rarely has a chance to see big diamonds,

300
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:24,767
so you knew the odds of her knowing that they were fake would be slim.

301
00:19:24,768 --> 00:19:27,767
Then, after you sold her the fake diamonds,

302
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:32,167
you instructed Suzuko to put those fake diamonds into this bottle

303
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:34,767
and told her to throw it in the river.

304
00:19:34,768 --> 00:19:37,667
If in case somebody finds out that the diamonds are fake,

305
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:40,467
you're the one who would be suspected.

306
00:19:40,468 --> 00:19:43,267
Seems like Suzuko was flustered

307
00:19:43,268 --> 00:19:45,167
and didn't notice anything about this bottle,

308
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:48,268
but it's really light compared to ordinary ones.

309
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:51,867
Even if an ordinary bottle were to be thrown in,

310
00:19:51,868 --> 00:19:55,167
the chances of it being retrieved would probably be slim.

311
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:58,667
However, to make the possibility of retrieval even closer to zero,

312
00:19:58,668 --> 00:20:00,967
you used this bottle.

313
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:04,567
You used this bottle made of candy glass that is usually used

314
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:07,767
as little props when shooting movies and TV dramas.

315
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:10,467
If this bottle is thrown into the river,

316
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:11,667
it would eventually melt,

317
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,767
bump into something and shatter to pieces and disappear.

318
00:20:14,768 --> 00:20:17,267
The fake diamonds would sink to the bottom of the river

319
00:20:17,268 --> 00:20:19,467
and retrieval would be impossible.

320
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:24,767
Then you can use the 100 million yen that you got a hold of legally.

321
00:20:24,768 --> 00:20:29,268
After all, you got hold of it through a legal transaction.

322
00:20:30,468 --> 00:20:32,267
You really thought it out well.

323
00:20:32,268 --> 00:20:35,867
Exchanging ransom for the hostage

324
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,567
is usually done at the very end.

325
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:42,567
But you did that in front of the eyes of the police

326
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:45,867
while transporting the ransom.

327
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:49,067
Where's the proof? Do you have proof?

328
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:51,268
The proof is that bottle.

329
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:56,867
Candy glass type bottles have limited use

330
00:20:56,868 --> 00:20:58,867
and cannot be preserved for a long period of time.

331
00:20:58,868 --> 00:21:01,867
So they have to be made one-by-one by hand.

332
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:05,367
So if we trace the route of where you got the bottle,

333
00:21:05,368 --> 00:21:08,167
your name should emerge.

334
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:12,067
And you probably didn't take care when handling the bottles,

335
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:15,767
because you planned to sink them to the bottom of the river.

336
00:21:15,768 --> 00:21:18,368
I'll bet your fingerprints are on the fake diamonds?

337
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:24,067
I'll just crack all these bottles!

338
00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:25,968
Then they won't serve as evidence!

339
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:36,968
Here they come.

340
00:23:07,668 --> 00:23:09,867
What? Did you catch a cold?

341
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:11,867
Yes.

342
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:14,267
I'm starting to get the chills.

343
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,267
Then drink medicine and keep warm.

344
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:19,767
Yes, I'll do that.

345
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:21,767
Come to think of it, Ran said that

346
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,767
when she was about to wash your clothes this morning,

347
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:27,667
she found little fish in the pocket.

348
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:31,867
I hope you weren't swimming in the river or something like that?

349
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,367
No way.

350
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:35,967
I thought so. You may be a kid,

351
00:23:35,968 --> 00:23:39,968
but you'd never do something like that in this cold.

352
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:45,568
I did exactly that, you see.

354

Help!

355
00:23:52,868 --> 00:23:54,467
The incense burner is missing?

356
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:56,668
The precious family treasure is gone.

357
00:23:57,468 --> 00:23:59,267
It's from the perp!

358
00:23:59,268 --> 00:24:02,367
"If you want the family treasure incense burner back,

359
00:24:02,368 --> 00:24:06,067
get ready 10 million yen. I'll contact you tomorrow."

360
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:08,167
Look forward to it.

361
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:10,868
Because I'll be sure to pay you back for this.
