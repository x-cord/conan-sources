1
00:00:01,613 --> 00:00:04,913
What? Mr. Minowa, the actor committed suicide?

2
00:00:04,913 --> 00:00:06,713
Is that true, Heiji?

3
00:00:06,713 --> 00:00:08,313
Don't talk too loud!

4
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:09,813
It still hasn't been publicized.

5
00:00:09,813 --> 00:00:11,713
But, how'd something like that happen?

6
00:00:11,713 --> 00:00:13,813
Beats me, I don't know yet.

7
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,213
It's dubious whether it's really suicide or not, too.

8
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:18,413
It's the same as the incident that occurred 4 years ago.

9
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:21,213
Then, isn't it suicide?

10
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:24,013
That's why I came to confirm it on video.

11
00:00:24,913 --> 00:00:28,213
How is it? Did you find anything, Heiji?

12
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:32,513
Just as I thought. This is homicide.

13
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:35,813
That video is sure popular.

14
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:36,813
Popular?

15
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:38,813
There was another person

16
00:00:38,813 --> 00:00:41,913
who asked to see that video besides you.

17
00:00:41,913 --> 00:00:44,113
Don't tell me that he was an intermediate school student too?

18
00:00:44,113 --> 00:00:46,413
Yes, one of them was.

19
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,313
One of them? You mean there were others?

20
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:50,613
Way before that boy came...

21
00:00:50,613 --> 00:00:53,813
A dandy man with a mustache came.

22
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:55,913
A man with a mustache?

23
00:00:56,813 --> 00:00:59,513
Another Snow Woman legend...

24
00:00:59,513 --> 00:01:01,713
Is that the hint for solving the incident?

25
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:03,013
Well, as for the questions,

26
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:05,613
ask me after you hear me out.

27
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:08,913
Long time ago, on a stormy blizzard night,

28
00:01:08,913 --> 00:01:11,413
there was a man named Shigekichi,

29
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:14,413
who was rushing back home from these mountains.

30
00:01:14,413 --> 00:01:15,913
Part way home,

31
00:01:15,913 --> 00:01:21,413
he ran into a long haired, beautiful woman wearing a silver kimono.

32
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:26,513
The woman lifted her head, and said with pleading eyes...

33
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:29,013
I sprained my ankle while walking along the mountain path

34
00:01:29,013 --> 00:01:31,613
and can walk no farther.

35
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:35,613
Will you please take me to my house?

36
00:01:35,613 --> 00:01:38,713
When Shigekichi asks her where her house is,

37
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:43,713
the woman silently points a dark forest where there is no road.

38
00:01:43,713 --> 00:01:47,513
But, no matter how far he walks,

39
00:01:47,513 --> 00:01:49,813
only the snow gets deeper and there is no house anywhere in sight.

40
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:52,513
Therefore, the man finally asks the woman...

41
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:55,713
Is this the right road?

42
00:01:55,713 --> 00:01:58,313
The woman nods without saying a word.

43
00:01:58,313 --> 00:02:03,413
The woman was waiting for the man to throw her down.

44
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:06,213
Yes. Because the identity of the woman

45
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:09,813
was "Snow Woman" who would eat the soul of the man

46
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:13,313
when he ran out of strength.

47
00:02:13,313 --> 00:02:16,013
The man's steps eventually become slow.

48
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:17,813
After a while, the mouth of the woman

49
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:20,713
who had been silent up to now slightly moves.

50
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:22,313
Young lady.

51
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:24,513
The woman smiles as if she had been waiting

52
00:02:24,513 --> 00:02:26,913
for the time to come and answers.

53
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,613
Yes, what is it?

54
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:31,713
Shigekichi is heaving heavily

55
00:02:31,713 --> 00:02:34,313
but squeezes out what he has to say...

56
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:36,213
Aren't you cold?

57
00:02:37,313 --> 00:02:40,313
The woman is flustered by the man's unexpected question,

58
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:42,513
and is at a loss for words.

59
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:45,313
Shigekichi endures the cold and exhaustion he feels

60
00:02:45,313 --> 00:02:49,013
and walks on with all his might.

61
00:02:49,013 --> 00:02:53,113
"Isn't it clustered inside the basket? Aren't you hungry?"

62
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:55,013
He tells her that there's only a little more to go,

63
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:57,913
so to hang in there.

64
00:02:57,913 --> 00:03:00,813
Although the woman answers him,

65
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,313
her voice gets weaker and weaker.

66
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:06,013
Then, finally her voice is not heard.

67
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:09,013
Shigekichi gets worried and stops.

68
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:12,513
He puts the basket down and looks inside.

69
00:03:12,513 --> 00:03:14,513
The woman is nowhere in sight.

70
00:03:14,513 --> 00:03:20,013
But a large amount of snow was found wrapped in a silver cloth.

71
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:23,813
I see. Shigekichi's warm heart

72
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:27,013
melted the cold Snow Woman's heart.

73
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:30,413
-Yeah. -And, so what's the hint?

74
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:33,813
So I guess the load is too heavy for you, after all.

75
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,213
But, for him,

76
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:37,313
I guess it would be a good problem solving exercise.

77
00:03:37,313 --> 00:03:39,613
-Him? -I'm sure that he's watching the movie

78
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:42,713
that Mr. Minowa appeared in at the hotel right now,

79
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:44,713
being that he's our son.

80
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:47,913
See, it's just as I thought.

81
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:50,813
Mr. Minowa's style of skiing that we saw this afternoon

82
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,113
is different from his style of skiing in the movie, right?

83
00:03:52,113 --> 00:03:53,213
You think so?

84
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:55,213
I think they're both good, like that of a professional.

85
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:58,313
That's how people evaluate his skiing.

86
00:03:58,313 --> 00:03:59,413
Take a look at this scene

87
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:02,413
where Mr. Minowa comes to rescue the heroine.

88
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:06,013
He comes skiing from the top until he frames out...

89
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,813
See, his cap strap is on.

90
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:09,713
But after he frames in again

91
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:12,113
when he carries her up, it's not on anymore.

92
00:04:12,113 --> 00:04:14,113
And it's supposed to be a cut that is connected.

93
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:15,113
True.

94
00:04:15,113 --> 00:04:16,713
Don't tell me that he's using a double.

95
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:20,113
-Maybe he can't ski? -No way.

96
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:23,213
He was skiing just a while ago and it was awesome!

97
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:25,113
Was it really him?

98
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:26,613
Of course.

99
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:28,613
I filmed it on video.

100
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:33,313
-See. -Hey, Sonoko.

101
00:04:33,313 --> 00:04:35,013
While Mr. Minowa was skiing his way here,

102
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:37,813
do you know where he had this bag?

103
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:40,913
Mr. Minowa put it in front of his fans himself.

104
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,513
He told them to watch it for him until he got back

105
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:45,313
because he had important things inside it.

106
00:04:45,313 --> 00:04:47,013
What? This bag?

107
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:48,913
An intermediate school boy came to look at it?

108
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,313
-When was that? -Just now.

109
00:04:51,313 --> 00:04:53,513
He didn't buy it though.

110
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:55,113
If that's too small,

111
00:04:55,113 --> 00:04:58,513
we have one with the same design a size larger.

112
00:04:58,513 --> 00:04:59,713
Is that right?

113
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:02,613
The belt stretches this much and it's quite convenient.

114
00:05:02,613 --> 00:05:03,913
True.

115
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:05,613
What's so convenient.

116
00:05:05,613 --> 00:05:07,713
Hey, Heiji. What're you angry about?

117
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:09,313
It's only natural.

118
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:13,113
Some intermediate school kid is one step ahead of me each time.

119
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,913
He borrowed the video from the hotel before I did,

120
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:18,613
and a queer mustached man also seems involved.

121
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:21,713
If things go as is, they'll solve the case before I do.

122
00:05:21,713 --> 00:05:24,413
Which means that you still have no idea, Heiji?

123
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:27,713
I do. I know who the killer is and the method that was used.

124
00:05:27,713 --> 00:05:29,913
I found out when we went to that store a while ago.

125
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,413
Then, why not report it to the police right away?

126
00:05:32,413 --> 00:05:34,213
But there's something I can't solve.

127
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:36,113
The loops on the poles that were on upside down

128
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:39,213
and the reason the bag was filled with snow.

129
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,813
My deduction cannot be proven unless I solve these problems.

130
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:44,413
What is it, Shizuka?

131
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:48,413
I thought I told you not to make private calls to me at work.

132
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:50,213
What, a case?

133
00:05:51,813 --> 00:05:54,413
-I found it! This is it! -What's that?

134
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:59,413
Remember the gunshot like noise that Mr. Minowa might've heard

135
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:01,513
before reaching the top on the lift.

136
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:04,613
The fact that this hasn't been retrieved yet,

137
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:07,813
means that the killer is still somewhere unable to make a move.

138
00:06:07,813 --> 00:06:11,813
My, you sound like you know it all already.

139
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:14,513
No, the most important trick that was used in the murder

140
00:06:14,513 --> 00:06:16,413
is still not solved completely.

141
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:17,613
The scratch that was left

142
00:06:17,613 --> 00:06:19,313
on the left side of the corpse on the lift...

143
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:20,913
I can't figure out what it is.

144
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,013
I figured out the snow packed bag and the killer,

145
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:25,413
but they don't connect right.

146
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:27,413
You've figured out who the killer is?

147
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:29,513
Yeah. There are four suspects

148
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:31,613
who are being interrogated by the police now.

149
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:35,213
Director Oyama, who was riding the lift in front of Mr. Minowa.

150
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:37,213
Mr. Katashina, the detective who was riding the lift

151
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:39,013
right behind Mr. Minowa.

152
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:40,413
Stuntman Mr. Mimata, who was at the ski slope

153
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:42,913
to call the director and the others.

154
00:06:42,913 --> 00:06:46,113
And Ms. Tateishi who failed to make it off the lift.

155
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:48,713
Wait, I can see that you know where Director Oyama was riding,

156
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:53,013
but how do you know where the other three were riding?

157
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,513
Do your really know who the killer is?

158
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:57,213
Mrs. Kudo!

159
00:06:57,213 --> 00:07:00,113
I got to hear what the police

160
00:07:00,113 --> 00:07:02,313
was questioning them about, you see.

161
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:04,913
What? But, how, why?

162
00:07:04,913 --> 00:07:08,613
It just so happened that our trip and Shinichi's ski class

163
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:09,913
coincidentally turned out to be the same place.

164
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:12,113
I mean, you deliberately came here.

165
00:07:12,113 --> 00:07:16,013
But Shinichi, you were 30 minutes late.

166
00:07:16,013 --> 00:07:20,613
An intermediate school boy just like you was here just a while ago.

167
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:23,413
What?

168
00:07:23,413 --> 00:07:27,213
You mean there's another deduction freak just like Shinichi.

169
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,813
That's new to me!

170
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:32,313
Talking about another, do you know?

171
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:35,113
About the other Snow Woman legend.

172
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:38,613
No god, it's pitch dark already.

173
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:41,713
The killer is being interrogated now and can't move just yet.

174
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:44,413
But if he's released, he will hide the evidence.

175
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:45,713
Heiji!

176
00:07:45,713 --> 00:07:47,213
What is it, Mom?

177
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:49,813
Rain makes puddles.

178
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:51,913
But with snow, you can make a snowman.

179
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:56,013
If that becomes ice, a large statue can also be made.

180
00:07:56,013 --> 00:08:00,813
But Yusaku says that this is the key to solving the mystery.

181
00:08:02,113 --> 00:08:04,613
Don't let outward appearance fool you.

182
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:06,513
By Heizo.

183
00:08:06,513 --> 00:08:07,913
What's he trying to get at anyway?

184
00:08:07,913 --> 00:08:11,113
Why talk about snowmen now?

185
00:08:11,113 --> 00:08:12,713
Heiji?

186
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:21,483
Will you cut it out?

187
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:25,283
I'm sorry, but can you answer the phone for me?

188
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:27,283
-It's in the pocket of my coat. -Yes, sir.

189
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:28,283
Who is it?

190
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:30,183
His hands are tied right now.

191
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:33,083
I've figured everything out.

192
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:37,783
I've figured out who killed Mr. Minowa under the pretense of suicide.

193
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:38,783
What?

194
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:41,483
As well as the trick that made the murder possible.

195
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:43,583
-Everything! -Huh?

196
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,783
An intermediate school boy again.

197
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:47,783
I'll bet you want to say that all four of us

198
00:08:47,783 --> 00:08:50,983
were capable of shooting Mr. Minowa, right?

199
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:53,783
Like I said before, it's impossible for us to have done it!

200
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,483
Since he was riding the lift alone,

201
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:57,783
we couldn't have made him hold the gun.

202
00:08:57,783 --> 00:09:01,683
Maybe the ex-cop and now detective could've done it,

203
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:04,483
but we could never aim and shoot at his head

204
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:05,683
in a blizzard like back then.

205
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:09,083
Hey, hey, even an ex-cop can't do something like that.

206
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,783
Because the blizzard was so bad

207
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:13,383
that you couldn't even see the lift in front of you.

208
00:09:13,383 --> 00:09:14,883
True.

209
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:18,783
Murder would've been impossible in that situation

210
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:23,283
if Mr. Minowa was really riding the lift alone.

211
00:09:25,783 --> 00:09:26,983
What?

212
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,983
Hey, hey, don't tell me that

213
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:32,183
you're going to say that somebody was inside that bag?

214
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:35,183
But that bag was packed with snow,

215
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:37,383
and no adult would've possibly been inside.

216
00:09:37,383 --> 00:09:41,183
No, no, a bag this size was inside.

217
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:44,983
The same kind of bag that is one size larger

218
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:46,983
and of the same design was sold at the shop of the hotel.

219
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:49,083
It can't be.

220
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,783
Are you saying that Mr. Minowa was carrying a bag

221
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:54,683
with the killer inside it when he got on the lift?

222
00:09:54,683 --> 00:09:57,783
No, the one who was in the bag wasn't the killer,

223
00:09:57,783 --> 00:09:59,983
but Mr. Minowa himself.

224
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:01,983
No, that can't be!

225
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:03,883
Then, the person who was carrying the bag was?

226
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:05,883
The killer.

227
00:10:05,883 --> 00:10:08,883
Most of Mr. Minowa's face is hidden by his hair,

228
00:10:08,883 --> 00:10:11,983
and he was wearing sunglasses back then.

229
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:13,583
If someone else were to wear a wig, a knitted cap,

230
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,283
sunglasses and ski wear,

231
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,183
people would be deluded to think it were Mr. Minowa.

232
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:23,483
But he talked to me and his fans.

233
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:26,383
It was Mr. Minowa's voice, of course.

234
00:10:26,383 --> 00:10:29,883
-How? -That's because Mr. Minowa himself

235
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:34,283
was listening closely from inside the bag and responding to everyone.

236
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:39,583
That's why everybody thought that he disguised killer was Minowa.

237
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,083
-Oh no... -I see.

238
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:46,683
That's why he was silent until he carried that bag.

239
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:48,183
You've got to be kidding.

240
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:52,683
A person as proud as he, would never go inside a bag.

241
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:53,883
That's probably because...

242
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:55,583
He was a proud person.

243
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,383
That's why he went inside.

244
00:10:57,383 --> 00:11:00,483
The fact that his skiing was of a professional level

245
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:03,583
was just a front and fake.

246
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,283
It was probably all a lie.

247
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:06,983
A lie?

248
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:09,483
I guess he could ski a bit,

249
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:11,483
but not good enough like a professional.

250
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:13,783
I watched the movie, that Mr. Minowa appeared in,

251
00:11:13,783 --> 00:11:17,583
"The Snow Woman's Love" and the "Mystery of Snow Woman"

252
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,083
back at the hotel a while ago.

253
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,883
Then there was a scene where he ran over to the heroine on skis

254
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:26,483
and framed out once. Then he zoomed back into the scene.

255
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:29,783
Moreover, when he was skiing, the cap trap was on.

256
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:32,183
When he zoomed, it wasn't there.

257
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:36,183
This means that someone else skied for him.

258
00:11:36,183 --> 00:11:38,383
Isn't that right, director?

259
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:42,183
Yeah. It wasn't that he couldn't ski,

260
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:45,583
but he hurt his leg in the first movie.

261
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:49,583
But he insisted on skiing himself,

262
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,883
so in order to persuade him, I secretly used a stuntman in his place.

263
00:11:52,883 --> 00:11:57,083
That ski scene was ironically evaluated highly.

264
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,583
So, I used a stuntman secretly in the 2nd movie, too.

265
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,783
You did?

266
00:12:01,783 --> 00:12:04,283
That's why, when the fans asked him to ski,

267
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:06,383
he let his substitute ski for him

268
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:08,983
and went into the bag and waited below.

269
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:11,483
Then, when his substitute came and carried the bag,

270
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:15,383
he conversed with the fans to act out his role.

271
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,983
Hey, hold it.

272
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:20,783
Don't tell me that the substitute is...

273
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,283
Yeah. The one who had that role,

274
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:27,683
carried the bag that Mr. Minowa was inside, and killed him is...

275
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,083
Stuntman, Mr. Mimata!

276
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,283
No one else but you could've done it.

277
00:12:36,283 --> 00:12:39,083
-Mr. Mimata? -Is it true?

278
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,383
But I think that the one who did the stunt

279
00:12:41,383 --> 00:12:46,083
for the movie 4 years ago was the late Mr. Mizukami,

280
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:49,483
because the skiing in the movie and today's skiing was different.

281
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:51,883
It's most likely that before Mr. Mizukami died,

282
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:54,983
Mr. Mimata secretly took on the role,

283
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,883
and he used it to his advantage to carry out the murder on the lift.

284
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:01,383
Right! He took only Mr. Minowa's head

285
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:04,683
out of the bag on the lift and held it down,

286
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,583
stuck the gun at his temple and fired.

287
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:10,283
He then took Mr. Minowa out of the bag and sat him down

288
00:13:10,283 --> 00:13:11,983
and made him hold the gun.

289
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:15,883
He then carried the bag and jumped off.

290
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:17,983
There are two places where the space

291
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:22,383
between the lift and the ground is only about 3 meters.

292
00:13:22,383 --> 00:13:25,283
The scratch that was found on the seat of the lift

293
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:27,583
was one that was made when he shot Mr. Minowa.

294
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:31,283
And the fact that Mr. Minowa was sitting on the left when on the lift,

295
00:13:31,283 --> 00:13:34,183
but was found sitting on the right side when found dead

296
00:13:34,183 --> 00:13:37,183
is evidence that this is what actually happened.

297
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,983
It sure is difficult

298
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:42,283
to shift the position of a dead person on a lift.

299
00:13:42,283 --> 00:13:44,283
But, when the gunshot was heard,

300
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,283
Mr. Mimata was talking to me.

301
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,683
That was probably the sound of a rocket fire cracker.

302
00:13:48,683 --> 00:13:50,283
After he wore the ski wear

303
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:52,783
that he had ready by the place he got off the lift,

304
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:54,883
he probably ignited the fuse of the rocket fire cracker

305
00:13:54,883 --> 00:13:57,083
with a lighted cigarette and poked it into a PET bottle.

306
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,383
He fired it shifting the time a bit to make a witness for his alibi,

307
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:05,983
by skiing down and talking to somebody when the sound is heard.

308
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:08,983
But, where did he get the bag that was packed with snow?

309
00:14:08,983 --> 00:14:11,183
I just said that there are two places

310
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,483
where that lift is only 3 meters away from the ground.

311
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:16,883
That's where the bag with the upside down ski pole

312
00:14:16,883 --> 00:14:19,883
hooked onto it was place, and later carried up to the lift.

313
00:14:19,883 --> 00:14:22,483
I see. 3 meters to the ground...

314
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:25,583
Ski poles are approximately 1 meter and 20 centimeters.

315
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,183
If the string one side is hooked on to the other pole and connected,

316
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:30,783
stretching over for it may make it reachable,

317
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:33,583
but would it be possible to pick it up in that blizzard?

318
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,483
No, no! Only one ski pole was used,

319
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:38,283
and the remaining 1 meter...

320
00:14:38,283 --> 00:14:41,383
was made by wetting the string of the cloth bag

321
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:43,683
with water and freezing it.

322
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,483
That's how the remaining one meter was compensated for.

323
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:48,883
The loops of both poles were upside down

324
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:51,183
because just one being upside down would draw attention.

325
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:54,683
But I wonder if you can see that bag from on top the lift?

326
00:14:54,683 --> 00:14:56,283
I mean the blizzard was so bad

327
00:14:56,283 --> 00:14:57,483
that even the lift ahead couldn't be seen, right?

328
00:14:57,483 --> 00:15:00,083
Did you know that the space between one lift and the other

329
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,583
has to be more than 6 seconds apart?

330
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,483
The speed at which a lift moves

331
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:07,083
is from 1.5 meters to 2 meters per second,

332
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,383
which means that the space between one lift and the other

333
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:11,383
is about 10 meters apart.

334
00:15:11,383 --> 00:15:13,583
Even if it is hard to something that is 10 meters apart,

335
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,683
the bag that was only 3 meters apart could easily be seen.

336
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,983
More so, if you know that the bag is already there...

337
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:21,383
But, what proof do you have?

338
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:23,283
I've got proof, too.

339
00:15:23,283 --> 00:15:25,283
If Mr. Mimata met with Ms. Tateishi

340
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:29,183
and went directly to be interrogated in the lodge,

341
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:31,483
he still should have it on him.

342
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,583
The same ski wear that Mr. Minowa was wearing.

343
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:40,583
Maybe you even have the bag that Mr. Minowa inside, too?

344
00:15:42,183 --> 00:15:44,483
I was enduring all this time.

345
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:46,783
It was so hot.

346
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:48,383
Mr. Mimata!

347
00:15:48,383 --> 00:15:49,983
So, you the one who did it, after all.

348
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,683
Which means that you knew, director.

349
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:53,883
Yeah.

350
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:57,183
I thought that your skiing had improved in the end,

351
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:01,583
but when I saw him dead, I realized it was you.

352
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,283
But, why?

353
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:05,183
I avenged the death of Mr. Mizukami

354
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:08,283
who was supposed to become your husband.

355
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:11,183
I killed Minowa using the same trick

356
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:13,583
that was used to kill Mr. Mizukami 4 years ago.

357
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,983
Just what do you mean?

358
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:17,683
Remember 4 years ago, that day,

359
00:16:17,683 --> 00:16:20,283
Minowa was troubled surrounded by his fans,

360
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:23,983
Mr. Mizukami said we can work something out.

361
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,483
He meant that

362
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:28,983
he would secretly put Minowa inside a bag and carrying him over.

363
00:16:28,983 --> 00:16:32,983
But Minowa took advantage of Mr. Mizukami's kindness and killed him.

364
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:34,783
He killed Mr. Mizukami who was planning on quitting his job as a stuntman

365
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:37,283
and become an actor!

366
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:40,583
He told me when I held him at gun point.

367
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,483
There's no way he can make a living as an actor.

368
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:44,583
I'm sure that when he gets desperate,

369
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,683
he is going to write a book on me and disclose everything!

370
00:16:46,683 --> 00:16:49,583
I guess he was scared.

371
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,983
How ironic

372
00:16:50,983 --> 00:16:55,283
that a movie that is just the thing to carry out the revenge is to be shot.

373
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:57,783
The fact is, I too, thought that the killer of the incident

374
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,383
that happened 4 years ago was Minowa.

375
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:03,183
That's why I decided to make this movie.

376
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:05,183
I didn't reveal anything yet,

377
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:06,683
but the real killer of this movie

378
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:09,083
was scheduled to be Minowa, who was acting the role of a detective.

379
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,083
The trick used is the same as was used 4 years ago

380
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,083
as Mr. Mimata had just mentioned.

381
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:17,583
I figured that he would give himself in if I showed him the script.

382
00:17:19,283 --> 00:17:21,883
I know that it's not for me, who quit being an officer to say,

383
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:23,783
but if you knew so much,

384
00:17:23,783 --> 00:17:27,383
I would've wanted you to prevent this stupid murder.

385
00:17:27,383 --> 00:17:29,583
Revenge only breeds revenge,

386
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,483
and the feeling of accomplishment vanishes on the spot...

387
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:35,183
It's just like the snow that falls onto the palm of your hand.

388
00:17:41,483 --> 00:17:44,583
Well, we'll hear you out at the station.

389
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,483
You'll come along too, won't you?

390
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:50,783
Inspector, what about the intermediate school boy on the phone?

391
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:53,583
He is telling of the exact same deduction of as that boy

392
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,683
with the exact same timing.

393
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:59,883
-What? -What?

394
00:17:59,883 --> 00:18:03,483
Heiji, why aren't you going with him?

395
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:04,983
Idiot! If I leave,

396
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,983
who's going to piggy back you back to the hotel down below?

397
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:09,383
Doh-doh.

398
00:18:09,383 --> 00:18:11,583
I finally figured out that

399
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,383
the belt of the bag was frozen only after dad dropped me a hint.

400
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:17,183
That's why as far as the intermediate school boy

401
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:18,783
that solved this case alone,

402
00:18:18,783 --> 00:18:20,783
I don't want to see him.

403
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:22,083
Why not?

404
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,583
Why should I go when you're the one who solved the case?

405
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,583
Take the PET bottle along with you,

406
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,583
and tell him that you solved the case by yourself.

407
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,883
I only figured everything out

408
00:18:30,883 --> 00:18:32,683
after dad told me the story of the Snow Woman

409
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:35,983
who pretended that she sprained her leg and went into the basket.

410
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:38,883
That's when I figured out that Mr. Minowa who wanted to pretend

411
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:41,783
that he was a good skier went into the bag himself.

412
00:18:41,783 --> 00:18:44,383
But your deduction was correct, wasn't it?

413
00:18:44,383 --> 00:18:47,383
No, this case was solved by the intermediate school boy

414
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:50,083
who figured everything out himself, not me.

415
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,183
-Hey. -Quiet.

416
00:18:52,183 --> 00:18:53,583
That's what you get for coming along with me,

417
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,883
despite having sprained your leg!

418
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,383
I'll bet you sprained your leg when practicing

419
00:18:57,383 --> 00:19:00,283
just so you could brag that you're an advanced skier.

420
00:19:00,283 --> 00:19:02,083
Well, thanks to you showing off,

421
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,583
I figured out why Mr. Minowa went into the bag right away,

422
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,583
and you also helped with a lot of things

423
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,283
so I guess I'll forgive you.

424
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:12,183
Idiot. I didn't practice

425
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:15,083
because I wanted to show everybody how good I was.

426
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:20,583
I wonder why there are two different stories about the Snow Woman?

427
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:24,583
I'll bet it's because the storyteller was a mother.

428
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,283
It's said that the folk tale of Snow Woman

429
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:30,183
was created as a warning to people to stay indoors during blizzards,

430
00:19:30,183 --> 00:19:33,183
and while mothers continued telling their children this story,

431
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:36,183
they began feeling empathy for her

432
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:39,683
and gradually changed the story.

433
00:19:39,683 --> 00:19:41,883
In other words, it first started as a story

434
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:44,683
of her killing her victims after exchanging her silver clothing,

435
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,883
but it changed to a story in which, she did not take the soul,

436
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:49,683
but rather, just melted into snow.

437
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:51,683
That's why the stories of Snow Woman

438
00:19:51,683 --> 00:19:54,483
are sad and sound quite familiar.

439
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,383
I couldn't see very well because of the snow.

440
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:07,183
But I'll bet it's him that intermediate school boy.

441
00:20:07,183 --> 00:20:10,183
Well, even if I don't see him, if he's a detective...

442
00:20:10,183 --> 00:20:12,983
We'll get to see each other one day on some mysterious stage.

443
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:46,283
So, that super intelligent detective left

444
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:49,483
without giving the police his name.

445
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:53,483
How about it? Unlike the detective that I know before he shrunk,

446
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:57,183
this guy is intelligent and modest!

447
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:59,883
I mean, you know, that's me.

448
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:19,783
Next Conan's Hint:

449
00:22:19,783 --> 00:22:22,083
"Coin Locker"

450
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,283
This is the closet we get to the Black Organization.

451
00:22:23,283 --> 00:22:24,783
Oh, no, Shinichi and we suddenly approach each other rapidly.

452
00:22:24,783 --> 00:22:27,083
Why is Conan involved?
