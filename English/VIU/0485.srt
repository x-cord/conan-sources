1
00:00:01,789 --> 00:00:03,589
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:05,389
After the tears is "The Company".

3
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:06,989
After the deduction, the culprit is finally found!

4
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:08,489
The black picture that connects to the Organization.

5
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:10,089
An unexpected person is there?

6
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:11,489
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:12,989
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,989 --> 00:00:14,889
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:55,534
After getting information about

10
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:58,534
a clue to the past of the mysterious new student

11
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:01,034
called Eisuke Hondo from Heiji,

12
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:04,934
we visited the home of a plastic model shop owner

13
00:02:04,934 --> 00:02:07,334
who said that he had the picture of Eisuke's father.

14
00:02:08,734 --> 00:02:11,834
However, the picture we went to see was gone!

15
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,734
From the traces left in the room,

16
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:18,934
I deduced that it was the work of an intruder.

17
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:20,434
Well, by the way,

18
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:23,634
does anybody have the spare key to this room?

19
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:26,534
"Souhei Nishizato (32)" -Well, there are.

20
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:27,734
"Shopkeeper of a model shop" -Three people do.

21
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:29,634
Will you please call them

22
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:31,734
and ask them what they were doing today anyway?

23
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,434
Okay.

24
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:35,934
-Hey. -Conan.

25
00:02:38,134 --> 00:02:41,434
How come you're not calling the police right away?

26
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:44,634
Don't tell me the one who broke in here is...

27
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:47,234
Not a member of the Black Organization.

28
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,634
There are too many clues left behind to have been carried out by them.

29
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:52,634
Then, why aren't you calling the police right away?

30
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:55,834
If the police come and start interrogation,

31
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:58,134
they'll find out immediately that

32
00:02:58,134 --> 00:02:59,734
we're not his grandfather's acquaintance!

33
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:01,434
So, before that,

34
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:04,334
I'm trying to make him aware of the situation as soon as possible

35
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:07,134
and catch the one who snuck into this room.

36
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:10,434
I've got to get it back.

37
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:15,534
The picture of Eisuke Hondo's father that was taken!

38
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:23,134
"Whereabouts of the Black Picture (Part 2)"

39
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:25,934
Saori?

40
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:29,234
No, it's no big deal.

41
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:31,734
I was just wondering how you were doing.

42
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:34,534
What were you doing today?

43
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:35,834
What do I have to tell you,

44
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:37,934
who I don't go with anymore something like that?

45
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:39,934
I guess you're right.

46
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:43,334
Nothing really. I just went shopping for some clothes!

47
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:45,834
I'm going on a date with my new boyfriend from now.

48
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,534
I see. I'm happy for you.

49
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:51,534
Yes! We're going to go eat at an Italian restaurant in Beika Hotel!

50
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:54,434
I advise you to eat good food sometimes too, Souhei!

51
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,534
You're always eating cup noodles, right?

52
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:57,734
Yeah.

53
00:03:57,734 --> 00:04:01,434
Make sure you take a bath! Understand?

54
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:02,834
Yeah.

55
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:05,834
Bye, then because he'll be coming here soon.

56
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:08,034
Don't call me anymore, okay?

57
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:09,734
Sorry.

58
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:17,734
Do I really have to do something like this?

59
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:23,634
Just in case.

60
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:26,334
Huh? What was I doing all day today?

61
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,534
Yeah.

62
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,534
I was confined to my room working on the war tank.

63
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:32,634
I was making the war tank! Tiger 1!

64
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:34,234
The contest is coming up too!

65
00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:35,634
I see.

66
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:38,134
And? Is going well, Tago?

67
00:04:38,134 --> 00:04:39,734
Yeah, just great!

68
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:41,734
Even the rust looks good!

69
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:43,534
Oh, I'll be looking forward to seeing it!

70
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:46,434
You've really become skillful recently too.

71
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:47,834
Oh, that's right.

72
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:51,034
Make sure you finish your soldier by tomorrow!

73
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:54,634
I want to make sure that it fits my tank.

74
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:56,834
-Tomorrow? -Yeah.

75
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:59,734
It would help a lot if you can also have it painted by then.

76
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:02,434
I'm going to start getting busy from day after tomorrow, you see.

77
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:03,934
No joke.

78
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:06,034
That means I've got to stay up all night.

79
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:09,734
I've got a load of dishes and laundry to do.

80
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:11,734
Do those things after you get up!

81
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:14,534
It's already late, and you'd be troubling you neighbors anyway!

82
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,134
If you like, I can go over to your place in the morning

83
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:21,434
and do your dishes and laundry while you're asleep, you know.

84
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:24,234
Thanks, that'd be a lot of help.

85
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:27,134
Oh, seems like someone's come.

86
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:28,934
See you tomorrow, then.

87
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:32,834
Delivery.

88
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,834
Okay, I'll be right there!

89
00:05:38,034 --> 00:05:42,234
You were sick in bed all day with a cold?

90
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:44,734
Hey, are you all right or what, Furusho?

91
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:46,934
Yes, sort of.

92
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:50,334
It seems I've got a bad viral illness.

93
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:54,234
I advise you to clean your room up too, Mr. Nishizato.

94
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:55,534
Yeah.

95
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:59,834
Your room is just as bad as mine when it comes to being messy.

96
00:06:03,134 --> 00:06:04,434
Yeah.

97
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:06,034
Talking about virus,

98
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:10,234
please make sure you upgrade your anti-virus software!

99
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:13,834
Yeah. A bad virus seems to be going around lately, I hear.

100
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:17,234
Yes. So if the pictures of the georama

101
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:20,734
that we made that you have on your blog is deleted by someone,

102
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:22,234
I'm going to cry.

103
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:24,334
But we can take the pictures over again anytime if we want.

104
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:26,434
Georamas are alive!

105
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:29,734
The feel and looks of the georamas change depending on the day!

106
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:32,234
Okay! Okay! I got it!

107
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:35,534
I'm always grateful for your skills in taking pictures.

108
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:38,034
Rest well and get well soon, okay!

109
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:42,034
Yeah, I got it. I'll upgrade the software,

110
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,034
-so don't worry. -It's wet.

111
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:46,334
Is this sweat?

112
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:51,434
Do you remember the number of the pairs of slippers you have?

113
00:06:51,434 --> 00:06:53,834
No. Because when the georama is completed,

114
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,334
I call a lot of my friends over

115
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:58,234
and we talk about what we made while drinking.

116
00:06:58,234 --> 00:07:00,834
I think I bought a lot of pairs though.

117
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:03,034
But I really don't know how many.

118
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,134
There aren't any damp slippers.

119
00:07:17,134 --> 00:07:20,234
And? Are there any suspicious ones among the three?

120
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:21,534
Not at all.

121
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:23,934
They all seemed to be their normal selves.

122
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:26,834
Well, I guess we can call the police and leave the rest to them.

123
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:30,034
What kind of people are the three?

124
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:31,534
What kind of people...

125
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,334
I just told you a while ago, didn't I?

126
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:37,934
See, like are they fat, skinny, tall...

127
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:42,534
Saori, the first one I talked to is about 150 cm.

128
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:44,834
And a bit plump.

129
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:47,134
How rude!

130
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,334
Tago, the next one I called is quite small.

131
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:52,534
He's shorter than my ex-girlfriend.

132
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:55,634
The last one I called, Furusho is tall and thin

133
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:58,634
and is a little over 180 cm tall I think...

134
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:01,234
But who cares about things like that now?

135
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:04,234
Well... Now, I'm sure.

136
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:08,334
That the person who came in here

137
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:12,334
and took the picture is among the three.

138
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:14,734
-What? -What's more surprising is

139
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:21,534
that person is still right here with us hiding!

140
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,634
Hey, what do you mean right here with us?

141
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:27,234
Don't tell me together in this room with us?

142
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:29,134
Very interesting, kid.

143
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,534
If you insist that the culprit

144
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:33,434
is my ex-girlfriend Saori who has the spare key to this room

145
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:36,534
or my plastic model making friends Tago or Furusho

146
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:40,434
and they are here hiding in this room some place...

147
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:44,534
-drag the one out here right this minute. -Yeah, okay!

148
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:48,534
But, will you promise me something?

149
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:50,634
What is it? Tell me.

150
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:54,334
If the culprit comes out, before calling the police,

151
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:58,134
will you show us the picture that the culprit is still holding, to us first?

152
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:01,734
If the police come here,

153
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:05,734
they'll most surely confiscate the album as evidence, right?

154
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:09,334
Then, I won't be able to see the picture for quite some time again!

155
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,034
Yeah.

156
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:15,734
The picture of the guy who forgot his wallet at grandpa's Okonomiya shop

157
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:17,634
is what you're referring to, right?

158
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:24,634
Yeah. I think that he really needs the wallet back,

159
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:26,834
so I'd like to return it to him as soon as possible!

160
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,434
But, how do you know that

161
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:34,334
the one who stole the pictures is still in this room?

162
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:37,234
Sweat.

163
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:40,534
-Sweat. -Sweat?

164
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:44,534
The chair that I used as a foot stool was damp with sweat.

165
00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:46,534
In other words, the culprit like me,

166
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:48,434
used that chair as a foot stool

167
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:52,434
and the chair got damp from the sweat on the sole of his feet, right?

168
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:55,934
But just because the sweat isn't dried yet,

169
00:09:55,934 --> 00:09:57,934
that doesn't mean that the culprit is still hiding in this room, does it?

170
00:09:57,934 --> 00:09:59,234
It's not here!

171
00:09:59,234 --> 00:10:01,634
What's not here?

172
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,034
The slipper that the culprit

173
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:07,834
should've been wearing that is damp with sweat.

174
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,834
It's nowhere in sight.

175
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:13,534
See, since there are no footprints left on the floor,

176
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:15,834
it means that the culprit was wearing slippers, right?

177
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:18,534
Maybe the culprit wiped them off?

178
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,634
He broke in to the room after all!

179
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:23,734
If so, the culprit would've wiped the sweat that is on the floor too!

180
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:28,734
But, all you checked were the slippers at the entrance, right?

181
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:32,234
You didn't check the one that I'm wearing now, did you?

182
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:37,034
These could've been the slippers the culprit was wearing, you know.

183
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:39,534
My socks are quite thick,

184
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:41,434
so I wouldn't be able to tell even if the slippers were damp.

185
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:44,934
No, I think that even a super dense person would realize.

186
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:47,534
Because not only would the slipper be damp,

187
00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:49,534
it would be warm too.

188
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:53,334
So, you'd know immediately that someone was here till a while ago!

189
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:54,834
When we came into this room,

190
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:57,334
nobody mentioned anything like that, which means...

191
00:10:57,334 --> 00:11:00,234
the person who knew you were coming back to this room

192
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:03,934
still wearing those slippers rushed to hide some place.

193
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:05,234
True...

194
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:09,534
But, the culprit was rummaging through the room for the pictures, right?

195
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:12,634
How did the culprit know that he came back?

196
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:15,034
Oh, that's...

197
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:17,034
Look over there!

198
00:11:21,134 --> 00:11:24,334
-The interphone? -Yeah.

199
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,034
When we came into the room a while ago,

200
00:11:26,034 --> 00:11:29,734
I pushed the button of the interphone, didn't I?

201
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:38,534
And right after that, you followed us from behind.

202
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:42,634
That's why the culprit could also tell that you came home too!

203
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:45,434
Because the interphone tells you who's at the door right away

204
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:48,834
since everything is displayed on the screen.

205
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:56,734
Just like when the courier came a while ago!

206
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:58,834
Come to think of it, that's true.

207
00:11:58,834 --> 00:11:59,934
I see.

208
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:04,534
With all of us coming up here to the room and ringing the doorbell,

209
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:06,834
the culprit would've had enough time to hide

210
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,534
while we open the front door.

211
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:09,834
That's right!

212
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:12,434
And? Who on earth is that culprit?

213
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:15,134
If you recall what the people were saying

214
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,434
when Mr. Nishizato phone them,

215
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:19,734
I think anyone can figure it out!

216
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:24,734
Because that culprit confessed where he was hiding...

217
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:30,334
on the phone.

218
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,134
No joke?

219
00:12:37,808 --> 00:12:41,508
And? What were the three saying on the phone?

220
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,808
Yeah. I think it was...

221
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:48,108
Saori was like usual, was giving pieces of her mind.

222
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:52,008
Like eat right and take a bath.

223
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:55,808
Tago said he wanted me to finish my plastic model by tomorrow.

224
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,108
And, also to do my laundry and dishes

225
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:00,608
after I get up in the morning.

226
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:03,308
Furusho said for me to clean my room

227
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:05,908
so that I wouldn't catch a cold like him,

228
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:09,408
and advised me to upgrade the anti-virus software in my computer.

229
00:13:09,408 --> 00:13:12,708
Which means that Mr. Furusho can be crossed off.

230
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,508
If you decide to clean your room,

231
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:16,908
you'd find him in there hiding.

232
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:19,008
Yeah, that's right!

233
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:21,508
Then, could it be Saori?

234
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:25,708
She told you to eat right and take a bath, right?

235
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,808
If you go out to eat or take a bath,

236
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,308
it would make it easy for her to get out of here.

237
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:33,108
That's suspicious.

238
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:36,708
Saori said I shouldn't call again because her boyfriend was coming.

239
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,508
I don't think it's Saori!

240
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:41,108
-What? -Because when you called her,

241
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:44,608
we couldn't hear her voice, right?

242
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:46,608
That means that the culprit is hiding in a place

243
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:50,108
where our voices or the noise we make can't be heard.

244
00:13:50,108 --> 00:13:51,508
From a place like that,

245
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:53,808
I think the culprit would not be able to tell

246
00:13:53,808 --> 00:13:55,708
if you leave this room or go to take a bath!

247
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,808
Besides, you said that

248
00:13:56,808 --> 00:14:00,508
you usually leave the light on even when you go out.

249
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,508
In other words, the only teeny bit of information

250
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,808
that the culprit is able to get

251
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:06,308
if any is the time displayed on his cell phone.

252
00:14:06,308 --> 00:14:09,008
Yeah, at this point.

253
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:10,608
Hey, wait a sec.

254
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:14,108
If the culprit's not Saori or Furusho, then...

255
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:19,008
The culprit is the one who asked you to finish the model by tomorrow

256
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:21,308
and moreover, told you to do the dishes and the laundry

257
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:23,908
after you get up in the morning.

258
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:26,108
I think it's Mr. Tago!

259
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:28,808
No way! Telling me to finish it by tomorrow

260
00:14:28,808 --> 00:14:31,908
means he expects me to stay up all night, doesn't it?

261
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:34,508
If I'm up all night, he can't run away!

262
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:39,608
In order to flee, he had to take the risk of making you do so!

263
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:43,808
What things do you have to do

264
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:45,908
before preparing to make plastic models?

265
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:47,708
What things?

266
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,508
First, I have to get tools like the rasp,

267
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:52,808
the putty, paint, and etc out...

268
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,308
What, after you get all the tools ready?

269
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:55,508
Let's see...

270
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:58,708
I'll open the window to air the place out.

271
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:01,408
Don't tell me that...

272
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:04,308
you think that Tago is out on the balcony?

273
00:15:04,308 --> 00:15:06,508
That's just it!

274
00:15:06,508 --> 00:15:09,108
He had to have you open the window

275
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,508
in order to flee from the balcony.

276
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:15,108
Because just a while ago, after you and I went out on the balcony...

277
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,908
We locked the window!

278
00:15:22,908 --> 00:15:24,008
I see!

279
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:27,608
He mentioned that you always keep the window open.

280
00:15:27,608 --> 00:15:30,008
He figured that once Mr. Nishizato finishes making the plastic model,

281
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:32,108
he would open the window and go to sleep.

282
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:35,208
Yeah. So as long as he opens the window,

283
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,408
the culprit can also sneak a peek inside the room too!

284
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:41,508
But, when we came out here a while ago, there was nobody there!

285
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,208
Yep! Not anywhere in view.

286
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,608
Not anywhere in view?

287
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:49,008
You know now why the person told you

288
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:53,608
to do the dishes and laundry after you get up in the morning, right?

289
00:15:57,508 --> 00:16:01,008
Hey, then don't tell me that he...

290
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:04,908
Right, the reason he said so

291
00:16:04,908 --> 00:16:09,408
was of course to keep you from opening the lid of the washing machine!

292
00:16:11,908 --> 00:16:14,408
Tago? You...

293
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,508
Oh, well, you see...

294
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,708
By the way, he said that

295
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:21,108
he'd do the dishes for you when he comes by tomorrow

296
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:23,208
because he was going to come into the room

297
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,608
from the balcony after you fell asleep,

298
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:27,508
and if by chance, you got up and caught him

299
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:31,408
before he goes out of the front door,

300
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,908
he could use it as an excuse and say, "I came early to do the dishes

301
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:37,208
but didn't want to wake you."

302
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,908
By saying something like this,

303
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:41,108
he could tiptoe around and act suspicious,

304
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:43,108
yet would be able to convince you of what he was doing.

305
00:16:43,108 --> 00:16:48,308
Yeah. Of course what you told me of his height and physique

306
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,308
helped me reach my conclusion!

307
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:52,408
He probably used that chair as a footstool

308
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:56,208
in order to take the album that was on top of the bookshelf,

309
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,508
because he was short

310
00:16:58,508 --> 00:17:01,208
and also built quite small.

311
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:04,208
Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to hide in the washing machine!

312
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:09,508
I'm sorry, Souhei! I didn't mean malice at all!

313
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:11,108
I didn't touch anything else in the room

314
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:12,308
except for the room where the album was,

315
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:13,908
so please forgive me!

316
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,608
So, are you the one who deleted the data of the picture

317
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:19,108
-that was in the computer? -Yeah.

318
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:22,508
But don't worry! I took a back up of it.

319
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,108
After I deleted the picture in question,

320
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:27,008
I was going to secretly put it back where it originally was.

321
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:28,608
Same with the picture in the album.

322
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:30,308
That was all I was going to take out.

323
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:32,608
And! Just which picture is it?

324
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:35,608
I don't have any picture of yours that you wouldn't want me to have!

325
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:39,108
The model...

326
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:41,208
The one I showed you last time...

327
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,808
The German military number 4 war tank model H.

328
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:48,408
Huh? That war tank was pretty good.

329
00:17:48,408 --> 00:17:51,208
The other model making members were praising it too,

330
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,208
saying that maybe you've started to get the hang of it.

331
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,308
That's not it.

332
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:58,008
I didn't make that tank.

333
00:17:58,008 --> 00:17:59,508
It's something that I bought

334
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:02,008
when I went on a business trip abroad.

335
00:18:02,008 --> 00:18:05,908
I actually bought it to use it as an example to make my own.

336
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:08,808
I just thought I'd surprise all of you

337
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:12,008
so I switched the name plate on it with mine and showed it to you guys.

338
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,708
But you guys believed that I made it

339
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,808
and started taking pictures of it.

340
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:18,008
On top of that, you started saying

341
00:18:18,008 --> 00:18:21,008
that you would introduce it on your blog.

342
00:18:21,008 --> 00:18:23,808
That's why I came here to retrieve the picture

343
00:18:23,808 --> 00:18:27,108
before you upload it on the internet.

344
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:31,108
You usually go to the gym today, but you came back

345
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:34,408
so I ended up hiding in the washing machine.

346
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:35,908
Stupid!

347
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:37,508
I kept my mouth shut and played along with your lies,

348
00:18:37,508 --> 00:18:39,508
-but you had to get all serious about it. -Huh?

349
00:18:39,508 --> 00:18:43,908
I knew to begin with that you didn't make that tank!

350
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:45,608
We all decided to say nothing

351
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:49,808
and play along with you until you regained your confidence!

352
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:51,308
You were all just playing along with me...

353
00:18:51,308 --> 00:18:52,908
How rude!

354
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:54,908
You're the one who's rude

355
00:18:54,908 --> 00:18:57,708
because you're the one who tried to deceive us first!

356
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,708
Will you...

357
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,508
please show us the picture we came for?

358
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,108
And you won't be calling the police, will you?

359
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:06,508
Yeah.

360
00:19:06,508 --> 00:19:09,308
You help look for the picture too!

361
00:19:09,308 --> 00:19:12,808
Picture... What picture?

362
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:14,308
The picture of my grandfather

363
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:17,908
taken together with a customer that used to patronize the shop!

364
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:20,908
The man that often used to bring his son along!

365
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:23,608
-Do you know him too, Mr. Tago? -Yeah.

366
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:26,908
He used to go to the same university in Osaka as I did.

367
00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:29,008
He used to take me a lot to the Okonomiyaki shop

368
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:30,908
that his grandfather used to run.

369
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:33,008
I was introduced to him there!

370
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:35,908
His grandfather said, that man was his number one customer!

371
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:40,208
If I remember correctly, that man used to scuba dive.

372
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,608
Huh? Didn't you say he was in the maritime-self-defense force?

373
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:45,308
Did he tell you that?

374
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:48,308
Oh, no. When I was about to pay the tab,

375
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:50,208
I dropped some loose coins.

376
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,508
The coins just happened to roll near his table,

377
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:56,308
and heard a bit of the conversation when I went to pick the coins up.

378
00:19:56,308 --> 00:19:58,408
He said, "We're finally going to take the dive."

379
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,208
Take the dive?

380
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:05,908
I was absorbed in making tanks and warships since I was a child,

381
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:09,608
so back then, I thought he was talking about submarines.

382
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,208
So, I asked Souhei's grandfather about it, and he told me that

383
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,708
the man was just an employee working in an ordinary company.

384
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,708
So, that's when I thought

385
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,608
he's scuba diving with his colleagues or something.

386
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,908
-With his colleagues? -Yeah!

387
00:20:21,908 --> 00:20:25,308
Back then, three or four men

388
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,308
dressed in black were with him

389
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:30,508
who looked to be foreigners were with him!

390
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:41,108
But it sure sounded like they were going

391
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:43,308
to challenge a very dangerous sea

392
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:46,208
because he was telling everybody

393
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:50,408
things like, "Good luck. No pain, no gain".

394
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:53,708
Good luck...

395
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:58,308
No pain, no gain...

396
00:21:00,908 --> 00:21:04,708
At that time, was his son with him too?

397
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,308
No, he wasn't.

398
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:10,608
When he brought his son with him, it was only him and his son.

399
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:12,008
Isn't this the one?

400
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:13,808
Yeah, right, it's this picture!

401
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:16,708
This boy probably pushed the shutter of your camera

402
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,508
when he was looking through the view finder!

403
00:21:18,508 --> 00:21:20,508
Yeah, I didn't know

404
00:21:20,508 --> 00:21:22,208
until I had this picture developed either.

405
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,608
Was he really an ordinary businessman?

406
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:28,708
Yeah, at least grandfather said so.

407
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,208
That this man was a businessman

408
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,508
who was hired by the company!

409
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:37,308
So, do you know what company that is?

410
00:21:37,308 --> 00:21:39,908
No, I have no idea.

411
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,608
Company?

412
00:23:21,308 --> 00:23:25,108
I'm happy for you, Shinichi.

413
00:23:25,108 --> 00:23:27,008
Shinichi! Shinichi?

414
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:28,808
Doc! No use.

415
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:32,008
He's been staring at that picture from a while ago

416
00:23:32,008 --> 00:23:35,208
and I don't think he can hear you at all, Doc.

417
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:38,008
Shinichi is in a world of his own.

418
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:48,108
Company...

419
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,908
"Next Episode"

420
00:23:55,908 --> 00:23:58,308
Something happened in this room.

421
00:23:58,308 --> 00:24:00,608
Yeah, most likely.

422
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:01,808
This is...

423
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,408
blood?

424
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:08,208
Evidence of "1/60"?

425
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:11,708
Yes. Evidence of "once an hour..."

426
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:14,808
Wrong, this didn't fly over here.

427
00:24:17,108 --> 00:24:22,708
Next Conan, "Welcoming Cat from Right to Left"

428
00:24:38,508 --> 00:24:40,108
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:24:40,108 --> 00:24:42,908
"The face of the clock"

430
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:44,208
Doc, do you have a watch?

431
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,808
Well, my stomach watch is growling.

432
00:24:45,808 --> 00:24:47,608
It's almost 20:00.
