1
00:00:01,039 --> 00:00:02,639
Doji Hiramune, a criminal psychologist,

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,639
makes repeated challenging comments

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,039
against the serial killer

4
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:09,839
whose case will expire in three days,

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,339
but he is found murdered to death in his house.

6
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:15,939
The letter Z is found carved on his back.

7
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:20,339
The letters E, S, and W were also found on the bodies

8
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:23,939
of the three victims of the serial murder case.

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,939
From the fact that the suspicious man

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,139
that Ai and Ayumi witnessed was whistling.

11
00:00:29,139 --> 00:00:31,339
The police concludes that it is yet another series of murders

12
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:33,239
committed by the same serial killer.

13
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:37,139
I accompany Officer Takagi who goes to visit

14
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:40,639
the bereaved family of the victims

15
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:42,839
and realize that the thing in common

16
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:44,439
that connects the four victims is mahjong.

17
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,739
I'll expose the true identity of the serial killer for sure.

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,039
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

19
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,339
Saturday nights are for mystery.

20
00:00:57,339 --> 00:00:59,539
Officer Takagi is all out to get but falls into a pitfall.

21
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:01,539
Love as well as the case takes a sudden turn.

22
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:03,139
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:04,839
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:06,939
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

25
00:02:46,943 --> 00:02:52,143
"An Old Scar and the Soul of the Detective"

26
00:02:53,643 --> 00:02:56,243
I know these people.

27
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,943
They used to come here and play mahjong together long time ago.

28
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:02,043
They used to be one of my favorite guests.

29
00:03:02,043 --> 00:03:04,143
How nostalgic.

30
00:03:05,243 --> 00:03:06,543
Who is he?

31
00:03:06,543 --> 00:03:09,343
He's Mr. Hiramune a criminal psychologist.

32
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:13,143
Only that picture is a very recent one.

33
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:16,743
He's the student that used to play with the three all the time.

34
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:20,043
Which means that these four men used to play mahjong here?

35
00:03:20,043 --> 00:03:24,743
Yes, they would get together at 10 pm on Saturday nights.

36
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:25,943
The doctor,

37
00:03:25,943 --> 00:03:27,843
assistant professor of the science and technology department,

38
00:03:27,843 --> 00:03:29,043
a man who just became a lawyer

39
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:32,443
and the university student that was studying criminal psychology.

40
00:03:32,443 --> 00:03:35,243
Although they were of different ages, they seem to get along very well.

41
00:03:35,243 --> 00:03:39,543
They used to discuss actual incidents that happened while playing mahjong.

42
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:41,643
They would say things like the culprit

43
00:03:41,643 --> 00:03:43,643
is the one who was answering the interview,

44
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:46,443
or that it was a trick using medical knowledge.

45
00:03:46,443 --> 00:03:50,343
Moreover, it's amazing that they were virtually almost always correct.

46
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:52,943
And? What about the four?

47
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:56,743
They were all murdered by the same killer.

48
00:03:56,743 --> 00:03:58,643
What?

49
00:03:58,643 --> 00:04:00,343
Four of them, all at once?

50
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:03,943
No, the first one was murdered 20 years ago.

51
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,443
Don't you know about it?

52
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:07,943
I don't watch the news much.

53
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:10,443
Because all I used to do was check the cases

54
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:12,843
that they deduced in the papers.

55
00:04:12,843 --> 00:04:14,843
Well, but I did so only during the two years

56
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:16,243
that they used to come here.

57
00:04:16,243 --> 00:04:19,543
After they stopped coming, I stopped buying the papers too.

58
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:20,943
They stopped coming?

59
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:21,943
Yes.

60
00:04:21,943 --> 00:04:25,143
They were saying something about a perfect crime or something

61
00:04:25,143 --> 00:04:27,543
but I couldn't hear them too well.

62
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:29,643
After the others stopped coming,

63
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:31,343
this student kept coming for a while.

64
00:04:31,343 --> 00:04:34,043
He used to sit at the table alone,

65
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:36,343
looking sad as he wiped the tiles.

66
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,743
Maybe that guy is the killer.

67
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:42,943
Do you have an idea who it may be?

68
00:04:42,943 --> 00:04:48,243
There was a man who used to always give them a piece of his mind.

69
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:52,943
And after the remaining members stopped coming,

70
00:04:52,943 --> 00:04:55,643
that man used to take the opportunity to hassle

71
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:57,443
the student who was waiting all alone.

72
00:04:57,443 --> 00:04:59,943
Back then, that man shouted,

73
00:04:59,943 --> 00:05:02,843
"I'm going to get all of you!"

74
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:05,043
Do you know who that man is?

75
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:06,143
I wonder...

76
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:08,543
I heard that he had a reputation for doing all kinds of wrong

77
00:05:08,543 --> 00:05:10,243
but I have no idea what his name is.

78
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:14,143
Remember that incident long ago when a gun was stolen?

79
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:16,643
While the police officer at the police box was put to sleep and off guard,

80
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:19,543
the gun was stolen and freaked everybody out.

81
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:22,843
But two days later the gun was sent back and returned.

82
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:27,143
It was rumored that the man was the one who did that too.

83
00:05:27,143 --> 00:05:29,143
This is the mahjong tile that was thrown

84
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:31,243
when they got into a big fight.

85
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:34,543
It's scratched so it can't be used anymore.

86
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,943
Did that man throw the tiles?

87
00:05:37,943 --> 00:05:39,343
Yes.

88
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:42,243
And who put the tiles away?

89
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:43,343
Me.

90
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,343
After the police came to stop the two and took them away.

91
00:05:47,343 --> 00:05:50,043
I gathered the tiles alone and put them away in this case.

92
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:52,843
Which means that the only fingerprints

93
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:55,243
on the scratched tiles are yours, Mr. Hiramune,

94
00:05:55,243 --> 00:05:59,243
and that man's, right?

95
00:05:59,243 --> 00:06:01,143
Who is this kid?

96
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:03,643
He's here with me to study social studies.

97
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:06,243
Besides if the man was taken along with the police,

98
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:08,343
there may be some kind of record left.

99
00:06:08,343 --> 00:06:09,943
Right.

100
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:15,743
Then, I'm going to take this scratched tile with me.

101
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,943
And, your fingerprint too.

102
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:23,343
Come to think of it, I got a strange phone call last week.

103
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:26,343
The person said, "20 years ago, the people who used to play

104
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:28,643
at the table were a doctor, assistant professor, a lawyer,

105
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:31,743
and a criminal psychologist, right?"

106
00:06:31,743 --> 00:06:32,943
What?

107
00:06:32,943 --> 00:06:36,043
You were able to specify a man who could be the serial killer?

108
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:38,643
Yes, sir. There was a record of the man

109
00:06:38,643 --> 00:06:40,443
who was brought to the police

110
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:42,543
after getting into a fight with Mr. Hiramune.

111
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:44,643
His address is unknown and he's unemployed.

112
00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:46,043
His name is...

113
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:47,643
Dokuro Kibo.

114
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:49,043
Kibo?

115
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:50,643
Dokuro Kibo?

116
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,043
You mean that Kibo, who robbed and committed murder?

117
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:55,043
If I remember correctly,

118
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:56,943
I heard he finished his term of 15 years,

119
00:06:56,943 --> 00:06:59,543
and was released just the other day.

120
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:03,643
Which means that the serial murders had stopped for 15 years because...

121
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:07,243
Which means he couldn't do anything because he was behind bars.

122
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:09,143
Yes, sir. Most probably.

123
00:07:09,143 --> 00:07:10,543
Okay.

124
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:12,843
Search out the guy right away

125
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:14,743
and bring him before me.

126
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:15,743
Yes, sir!

127
00:07:17,343 --> 00:07:20,643
Officer Takagi is sure out to get, isn't he?

128
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:22,243
Maybe he found himself a girlfriend or something.

129
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:23,343
Yes.

130
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,643
There has been such rumors going around here and there.

131
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:28,243
Tell him to keep on his guard.

132
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:31,043
You know, like you see on TV and the movies.

133
00:07:31,043 --> 00:07:32,343
Stories about officers who die on duty

134
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:35,443
because just as they are about to carry out an important

135
00:07:35,443 --> 00:07:36,943
promise with their loved one,

136
00:07:36,943 --> 00:07:39,643
they fall prey to the bullet of the culprit.

137
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:42,643
But those are only made up stories.

138
00:07:42,643 --> 00:07:45,343
Morimura ended up that way too.

139
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:47,143
His wedding was coming up in a month,

140
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:49,543
so for the sake of his wife-to-be

141
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:53,643
he wanted to make as many points as possible and rushed things.

142
00:07:53,643 --> 00:07:57,143
And as a result, he ended up being run over by the suspect's car.

143
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,643
Let's go, Officer Sato.

144
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:00,643
Yes.

145
00:08:01,743 --> 00:08:04,643
Maybe I've aged.

146
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:06,443
This scar...

147
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:08,143
I reacted to a man who just happened

148
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:10,243
to meet the suspect at a sauna.

149
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:13,643
And today, when I went into the house of the fourth victim,

150
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:16,243
this scar of mine was throbbing.

151
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:17,843
But, now only several hours later,

152
00:08:17,843 --> 00:08:20,443
the throbbing's gone away

153
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:22,643
as if nothing has happened.

154
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:26,343
It could be that the heavens are telling me

155
00:08:26,343 --> 00:08:28,943
that my mission is over.

156
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,943
Gee.

157
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:34,643
I thought that Officer Takagi was working unusually fast

158
00:08:34,643 --> 00:08:37,443
but come to find out Conan did all the work.

159
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:39,543
So, I guess the thing about going to a hot spring

160
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:40,743
isn't going to be realized then.

161
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:42,043
What?

162
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:44,943
Why don't you go either way? Go to the hot spring with him.

163
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:47,243
After all, he did pin down the culprit.

164
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:48,943
Don't be stingy about it.

165
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:52,043
No. Personal feelings shouldn't be mixed up with work.

166
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:53,443
I almost forgot

167
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:55,543
that this job of ours is one in which we could lose our lives

168
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:57,143
with just one slight mistake.

169
00:08:58,743 --> 00:09:01,943
I'll take the children home in my car,

170
00:09:01,943 --> 00:09:03,943
so you go and join Officer Chiba and the others

171
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,543
and investigate Kibo.

172
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:06,743
Will do.

173
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:11,243
Yes. Sato here.

174
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:15,643
What? You took custody of Kibo?

175
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:18,343
We just found him in his apartment

176
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:21,043
and asked him to come of his own initiative to the police,

177
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:23,043
and is heading this way.

178
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:24,843
Have Eiki, Mr. Nabei's son come over here.

179
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:27,043
You're going to have him confirm his voice, right?

180
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:30,343
Because he heard the voice of the suspect when he was a child.

181
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:32,343
Right. I'm counting on you.

182
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:35,643
Officer Takagi, I'll leave Eiki to you.

183
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:37,443
Yes, will do.

184
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:41,443
He was arrested quite easily, wasn't he?

185
00:09:41,443 --> 00:09:43,243
The serial killer.

186
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:44,743
I thought there was going to be more exciting chasing

187
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:46,943
and around and all that.

188
00:09:46,943 --> 00:09:49,343
With a lot of guns firing and all.

189
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:51,543
That's only in the movies and on TV.

190
00:09:51,543 --> 00:09:53,843
The actually is quite bland.

191
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,443
You don't look happy.

192
00:09:55,443 --> 00:10:00,343
The letter Z that was left on Mr. Hiramune's back's bugging me.

193
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:02,643
Since the letters in the order of E, S, W

194
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:07,543
were found on the body of the victims who were killed

195
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:09,643
in the previous three cases, the last letter should be N.

196
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:13,543
Maybe the letters really meant nothing after all?

197
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:15,143
If it meant east, west, south and north

198
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:19,843
the order of the letters should be EWSN and not ESWN.

199
00:10:19,843 --> 00:10:23,943
No, but in mahjong the order is east, south, west and north,

200
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:26,943
so it should be E, S, W,

201
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,543
but I wonder why the last letter is Z?

202
00:10:29,543 --> 00:10:31,243
He was probably going to knock the corpse down on its side

203
00:10:31,243 --> 00:10:33,143
after he committed the murder.

204
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:36,143
If you turn the letter Z sideways, it becomes an N.

205
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:40,643
If so, I wonder why he didn't turn the corpse sideways.

206
00:10:40,643 --> 00:10:41,943
True.

207
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:43,743
What concerns me is...

208
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:47,143
the "Ctrl" key that Mr. Hiramune put his blood on.

209
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:50,143
In other words, the control key and "C" key,

210
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:51,643
with these two keys,

211
00:10:51,643 --> 00:10:54,143
I can tell he's trying to point out the computer,

212
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:56,943
but I can't figure out why he's holding the cord of the mouse.

213
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:58,343
Mouse?

214
00:10:58,343 --> 00:11:02,443
That sort of round thing that you use to operate the computer.

215
00:11:02,443 --> 00:11:05,443
The cord that is connected to it looks like the tail of a mouse,

216
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:07,043
so that's how it got it's name.

217
00:11:08,243 --> 00:11:12,443
Then, he's holding the tail of the mouse

218
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:14,443
so that person is a cat.

219
00:11:15,443 --> 00:11:19,443
Gee, come off it. Ayumi, what a cute thing to say!

220
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:22,343
Very true.

221
00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:25,043
You don't have to laugh so hard.

222
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:26,343
Cat...

223
00:11:26,343 --> 00:11:29,543
I see, that's what it was.

224
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:34,843
This serial killer case had ended 15 years ago.

225
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:37,243
Give me a break, officer.

226
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:39,043
After serving a term of 15 years,

227
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:41,743
I finally got out.

228
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,043
I'd never commit murder again.

229
00:11:45,043 --> 00:11:47,743
Do you think this guy's the culprit?

230
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:48,943
If we have Mr. Eiki Nabei

231
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:51,543
who heard the voice of the suspect when he was a child,

232
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:54,043
wouldn't that clear everything?

233
00:11:55,343 --> 00:11:58,643
What if it were you?

234
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:02,543
What would you do if an officer

235
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:04,943
who left a large sword scar on your face appeared before you?

236
00:12:04,943 --> 00:12:07,243
Well, I think I'd be surprised.

237
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:11,843
The man didn't even raise a brow when he passed me.

238
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:16,443
Maybe this guy Dokuro Kibo is...

239
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:20,843
What? Dokuro Kibo isn't the serial killer?

240
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:22,043
What makes you say that?

241
00:12:22,043 --> 00:12:28,243
I'm sure Mr. Hiramune knows what kind of person the culprit is.

242
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:32,043
Besides, if the two fought in the past at the mahjong parlor,

243
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,243
it's hard to believe that they would want to see each other,

244
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:36,143
just the two of them.

245
00:12:36,143 --> 00:12:39,443
Moreover, in Mr. Hiramune's dying message says that

246
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:44,143
the serial killer didn't kill him.

247
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:47,243
Blood was on the control key and C key,

248
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:49,043
pushing both keys means "copy".

249
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:50,743
He was holding the cord of the mouse,

250
00:12:50,743 --> 00:12:53,843
which meant he was the cat that had grabbed the mouse's tail.

251
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:56,943
Put the two together and you get the word "copycat".

252
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,043
In other words, his message was that the one who killed him

253
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:01,843
copied the murder method of the serial killer.

254
00:13:02,843 --> 00:13:04,043
A mimicked murder?

255
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:07,243
What's that, some kind of minced meat or something?

256
00:13:07,243 --> 00:13:10,743
It's this tomato tasting Italian soup with vegetables in it.

257
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:12,143
That's minestrone.

258
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:14,943
A mimicked murder is

259
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:16,543
when someone copies somebody else's murder method

260
00:13:16,543 --> 00:13:18,543
to commit a murder.

261
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:22,143
But, why is it a cat?

262
00:13:22,143 --> 00:13:24,743
The word copycat was comes from

263
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:26,343
the fact that kittens copy their parents.

264
00:13:26,343 --> 00:13:30,143
But, how did Mr. Hiramune know that the killer was a copycat?

265
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,543
He knew because...

266
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,543
Mr. Hiramune, who was killed

267
00:13:35,543 --> 00:13:37,543
was actually the serial killer himself.

268
00:13:37,543 --> 00:13:39,043
What?

269
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:42,343
If so, it's not hard to understand

270
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:45,143
why the letter Z was found on his back.

271
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:49,043
The serial killer is supposed to have a large sword scar

272
00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:52,643
that was made by Superintendent Matsumoto on his back.

273
00:13:52,643 --> 00:13:54,543
In order to make his scar inconspicuous,

274
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:58,743
to ward off any suspicion that he may be the serial killer,

275
00:13:58,743 --> 00:14:02,443
Mr. Hiramune secretly wrote the alphabet Z over his scar.

276
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,143
I see.

277
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,343
Then, this murder could be made

278
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:09,343
to look as if it were the serial murder case too.

279
00:14:09,343 --> 00:14:11,843
Yes, if the police is made to believe so,

280
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:15,343
they will keep pursuing the dead serial murder

281
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:18,743
and the culprit figured that their hands would never reach over to him.

282
00:14:18,743 --> 00:14:22,243
And? Who is that copycat?

283
00:14:22,243 --> 00:14:25,643
If he's the guy that was whistling,

284
00:14:25,643 --> 00:14:28,643
it's one of the members of the bereaved family.

285
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:33,443
"Nabei"

286
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:36,943
Strange. The lights are on and yet.

287
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:39,943
It's open.

288
00:14:39,943 --> 00:14:42,243
Mr. Nabei.

289
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:45,143
I'm from the police, I just visited you a while ago.

290
00:14:45,143 --> 00:14:48,643
Mr. Nabei, will you please come with me to the station?

291
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:50,043
Mr. Nabei!

292
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:58,707
All the members of the bereaved family may know

293
00:14:58,707 --> 00:15:02,707
that the letter of the alphabet was carved on the victim's back,

294
00:15:02,707 --> 00:15:09,107
but the only one who knows that the killer whistles a certain tune,

295
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:10,907
or uses mahjong terminology is...

296
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:12,007
It can't be.

297
00:15:12,007 --> 00:15:14,407
Mr. Eiki Nabei who was in the house together with the killer

298
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:15,707
at the time of the murder?

299
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:19,807
Right, he knows the voice of the killer

300
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:23,007
so after hearing Mr. Hiramune's voice and his way of talking

301
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:24,307
through the many TV appearances he made,

302
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:27,507
he probably called all the mahjong parlors

303
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:29,207
that his father may have stopped by at,

304
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:32,007
and after he found the link between Mr. Hiramune and the three victims

305
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:36,107
he was convinced that Mr. Hiramune was the serial killer.

306
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:39,607
It probably took him 15 years before he realized the truth

307
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:44,307
because Eiki wasn't familiar with mahjong terminology until he grew up.

308
00:15:44,307 --> 00:15:45,807
Please wait.

309
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:49,807
He's the one who was angry when went to his house a while ago, right?

310
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:52,207
Officer Takagi went to get him.

311
00:15:55,907 --> 00:15:59,707
Just as would be expected of an officer pursuing a serial murder case,

312
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:02,907
you're armed with a gun.

313
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:07,107
But, seeing that you've come here alone only shows

314
00:16:07,107 --> 00:16:11,207
that I'm not deemed to be the culprit yet.

315
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:12,407
The culprit?

316
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:16,407
Don't tell me that you killed your own father 15 years ago?

317
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:18,107
Idiot.

318
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:20,807
-Hiramune did that. -What?

319
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:24,007
I avenged my father's death today.

320
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:25,607
I called Hiramune and told him,

321
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:27,707
"I just remembered something about the case 15 years ago,

322
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:32,607
so before going to the police, I'd like to discuss it with you

323
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:35,407
since you're a criminal psychologist."

324
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:38,507
He didn't have the slightest idea that I was going to take revenge.

325
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:40,707
I threatened him just a bit

326
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,707
and he started talking away..

327
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:45,207
The motive for him killing my father and the others

328
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:47,107
was the topic that was brought up when they were playing mahjong,

329
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,707
"The perfect crime..."

330
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:49,907
They were talking about

331
00:16:49,907 --> 00:16:53,907
whether they could steal a gun from the police box.

332
00:16:53,907 --> 00:16:55,607
They had split opinions,

333
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:57,407
but Hiramune decided to actually do it

334
00:16:57,407 --> 00:17:01,607
and prove that a perfect crime could indeed be committed.

335
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:04,307
However, although he thought that everyone would praise him

336
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:06,307
the doctor and the assistant professor despised him

337
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:09,907
saying that they couldn't continue playing mahjong with a criminal.

338
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:11,307
Thinking that it would affect his future

339
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:14,207
if what he did were to be exposed, he said he killed them.

340
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:16,607
Although as a joke,

341
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:20,107
my father urged him to commit the perfect crime as well.

342
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,407
So felt that he also responsible and didn't say anything for a while.

343
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:23,607
But five years later,

344
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:26,107
my father suggested that they turn themselves in to the police.

345
00:17:26,107 --> 00:17:29,707
That's why he said he shut my father up the same way he did the others.

346
00:17:29,707 --> 00:17:32,407
So, what shall I do now?

347
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:36,107
I'd probably be caught right away even if I took your car and fled.

348
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:41,407
That's my cell phone.

349
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:44,607
It's a call from your girlfriend, officer?

350
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:47,007
Good timing, tell her to come here.

351
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,807
"Miwako Sato" -I'll use her as hostage.

352
00:17:48,807 --> 00:17:50,907
Why? Don't worry.

353
00:17:50,907 --> 00:17:54,607
If I get to flee safely, I'll let her go free.

354
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:58,407
Hurry up and answer the phone.

355
00:17:58,407 --> 00:17:59,607
I'm sure you already know.

356
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:02,007
Don't say anything. If you do, I'm firing this gun.

357
00:18:04,307 --> 00:18:07,707
I guess my cell phone broke.

358
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:10,907
I guess I'm the only hostage left.

359
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:13,907
Why you...

360
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:17,707
What? The suspect is Eiki Nabei?

361
00:18:17,707 --> 00:18:22,707
Yes, sir. He's at least most likely the one who killed Mr. Hiramune.

362
00:18:22,707 --> 00:18:26,607
I can't get hold of Officer Takagi who went to pick him up.

363
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:28,607
Please send a back up crew to him immediately.

364
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,307
"The Metropolitan Police Department"

365
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:32,107
Calling all officers.

366
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:34,207
Head for the Nabei residence on the double.

367
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:38,107
There's a possibility that the suspect has possession of Takagi's gun.

368
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:41,507
Be on full guard when coming in contact with him.

369
00:18:41,507 --> 00:18:45,407
Listen! Life is lost in a split second.

370
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:47,707
Officer Takagi.

371
00:18:52,907 --> 00:18:55,007
Why you...

372
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:57,307
How dare you!

373
00:19:04,107 --> 00:19:05,307
Darn.

374
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:06,807
You asked for it.

375
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:09,907
Darn. Dogs...

376
00:19:09,907 --> 00:19:11,907
They've figured it out.

377
00:19:11,907 --> 00:19:14,207
No, Officer Sato?

378
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:18,507
No. Don't come in now.

379
00:19:26,307 --> 00:19:28,507
Officer Sato...

380
00:19:31,107 --> 00:19:32,207
Oh, no.

381
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:34,907
Officer Takagi was shot?

382
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:40,407
"Tokyo Metropolitan Police Hospital"

383
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:42,807
What?

384
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:43,807
So...

385
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,507
it turned out the way it usually does in movies and dramas.

386
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:49,407
No.

387
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:51,707
Why does Officer Takagi have to die

388
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:54,407
just because we promised to go to the hot spring together?

389
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:55,407
Hot spring?

390
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:57,907
Officer Takagi!

391
00:19:57,907 --> 00:19:58,907
Oh, no, I mean...

392
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,507
You know, the usual?

393
00:20:00,507 --> 00:20:02,707
The evidence that he coincidentally put inside his pocket

394
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:04,207
during the investigation

395
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:07,307
saved his life from the culprit's bullet.

396
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,107
The mahjong tile.

397
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:11,607
Come to think of it,

398
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:14,607
he was putting one inside his chest pocket at the mahjong parlor.

399
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:19,607
Thanks to Officer Takagi knocking down Eiki Nabei despite being shot at,

400
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:21,907
the officer who burst into the room was able to nab Nabei

401
00:20:21,907 --> 00:20:23,907
without getting hurt.

402
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:26,007
I guess it can be said that Eiki was also a victim of this case,

403
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:28,107
which pushed him to do what he did.

404
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:30,007
Then, how is Officer Takagi?

405
00:20:30,007 --> 00:20:31,707
He's gone through treatment

406
00:20:31,707 --> 00:20:34,107
and is sleeping in his room now.

407
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,807
He's fast asleep.

408
00:21:57,807 --> 00:22:00,807
What was the meaning of that whistling?

409
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:02,507
The feeling of the composer,

410
00:22:02,507 --> 00:22:04,107
"Let's stay the we are" was weaved into the song.

411
00:22:04,107 --> 00:22:08,107
In other words, Hiramune wanted to continue the deduction battles

412
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:11,107
that they had continued for two years,

413
00:22:11,107 --> 00:22:14,307
and that's why Hiramune Doji is thought to have whistled that tune,

414
00:22:14,307 --> 00:22:16,307
according to Superintendent Matsumoto.

415
00:22:16,307 --> 00:22:18,007
I see.

416
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:19,507
Well, but...

417
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:20,807
With this wound,

418
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:24,007
we can't possibly go to the hot spring that we promised to go together.

419
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:26,407
You mean that promise was still valid?

420
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:30,107
Yes. I mean you were just great

421
00:22:30,107 --> 00:22:31,807
so I was looking forward to it.

422
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:34,107
But, too bad I guess.

423
00:22:34,107 --> 00:22:37,307
I always end up like this, don't I?

424
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:41,507
Even back during the bomb explosion case

425
00:22:41,507 --> 00:22:43,707
and the Hammer man case.

426
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:44,907
I'm almost about to make it,

427
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:47,007
but can't seem to make it through.

428
00:22:52,107 --> 00:22:53,707
Where's Takagi's room?

429
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:56,007
I think it's room 304.

430
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:59,407
Hot spring. Hot spring?

431
00:22:59,407 --> 00:23:02,407
You can't seem to make it through for what?

432
00:23:02,407 --> 00:23:03,507
Oh, no.

433
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,707
Well, something gets in the way and...

434
00:23:05,707 --> 00:23:07,407
"Wataru Takagi"

435
00:23:07,407 --> 00:23:09,107
Wait!

436
00:23:09,107 --> 00:23:11,007
Conan?

437
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:14,207
Officer Takagi, just drank his tranquilizer a while ago.

438
00:23:14,207 --> 00:23:15,907
And he just fell asleep.

439
00:23:15,907 --> 00:23:17,807
Maybe it's better...

440
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:19,407
Not to wake him.

441
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:21,407
I think you should come back later.

442
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:22,807
I see.

443
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:25,107
Let's come again in the evening.

444
00:23:25,107 --> 00:23:26,707
I guess so.

445
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:51,907
So, now we get to go to the hot spring with them.

446
00:23:51,907 --> 00:23:53,307
Yes.

447
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,907
No, I don't think so.

448
00:23:58,307 --> 00:24:00,307
A haunted house?

449
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:02,907
I hear that a weird man is living there.

450
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:07,207
This seems to call for an investigation.

451
00:24:07,207 --> 00:24:09,607
To be made by the Youth Detective Squad.

452
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:11,407
What happened to the name plate?

453
00:24:11,407 --> 00:24:13,207
It's not here.

454
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:17,607
I wonder why he moved into the haunted house.

455
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:19,507
Let's go check.

456
00:24:19,507 --> 00:24:21,807
Mysteries gotta be solved.

457
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:23,407
Next Conan,

458
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:27,207
"The Secret of The Vanished Masterpiece".

459
00:24:42,707 --> 00:24:43,807
Ready, start.

460
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:45,607
Next Conan's Hint:

461
00:24:45,607 --> 00:24:47,407
"Kudo" -"Name plate".

462
00:24:47,407 --> 00:24:48,707
The nameplate at my house says "Yoshida".

463
00:24:48,707 --> 00:24:49,807
What about you, Conan?

464
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:50,807
Mouri's written.

465
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:52,207
Free-loaders sure have it tough.
