1
00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:04,525
We ran into the mini police car of the two women police officers,

2
00:00:04,525 --> 00:00:08,825
Yumi Miyamoto and Naeko Miike on our way back from school.

3
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:13,525
Just then, Naeko gets a call on her cell phone reporting a case.

4
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:15,625
We rush over to the scene,

5
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:19,725
and find a corpse hanging from a chandelier there.

6
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:22,425
By the feet of the corpse was what looked to be a will,

7
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:25,925
and it was first thought to be suicide but...

8
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,325
I see.

9
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:34,225
So, that was the one kimono she had prepared?

10
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:38,225
The one prepared move?

11
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:40,225
If I'm not mistaken...

12
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:55,125
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

13
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,925
are slashed by the light of deduction.

14
00:00:56,925 --> 00:00:59,225
The suspect is Yumi Miyamoto's ex-boyfriend?

15
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,225
One flash move of deduction clears the checkmated crime scene.

16
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:02,725
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:04,725
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:07,025
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:36,053 --> 00:02:41,153
"The Neighbor at the Site is an Ex-Boyfriend (Part 2)"

20
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:44,053
Inspector Megure!

21
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:46,353
We got a testimony of a suspicious character being seen!

22
00:02:46,353 --> 00:02:47,353
What?

23
00:02:48,553 --> 00:02:51,253
According to the concierge on the first floor,

24
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:54,553
a suspicious looking person wearing a cap, mask and glasses,

25
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:56,753
as if hiding his face went in and out of the condo!

26
00:02:57,753 --> 00:02:59,153
Officer Chiba!

27
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:00,653
When was that?

28
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:04,353
After Mr. Itami and the housemaid left.

29
00:03:04,353 --> 00:03:07,253
Why didn't the concierge stop him?

30
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,453
He said he thought the man was a resident

31
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:11,153
because he used a key to come in.

32
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:13,853
He also mentioned that Mr. Itami's son also came.

33
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:15,653
His son?

34
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,753
Yes.

35
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:20,553
He said it was before Mr. Itami and the housemaid came home,

36
00:03:20,553 --> 00:03:23,453
but he's not really sure if it was before

37
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,353
or after the suspicious man came.

38
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:28,753
Are you by chance...

39
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,553
Sakurako,

40
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:34,153
the one who's one year below me?

41
00:03:35,153 --> 00:03:37,953
"Sakurako Yonehara (23), Housemaid" -Chibacchi! Long time no see!

42
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:41,753
So the housemaid was you, Sakurako.

43
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:46,053
Why doesn't he remember me?

44
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:49,053
Come to think of it, you may not remember,

45
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:51,753
but the one who was always with you...

46
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:54,253
Officer Chiba! Go take a look!

47
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:55,853
Yes, sir.

48
00:03:55,853 --> 00:03:58,053
Hey, what's with this brat?

49
00:03:58,053 --> 00:03:59,653
Let go of me!

50
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:01,453
I'm not letting you go!

51
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:06,453
What're you guys doing?

52
00:04:06,453 --> 00:04:09,953
What do you mean what? I caught this suspicious guy for you!

53
00:04:09,953 --> 00:04:12,753
I'm not anybody suspicious.

54
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,453
You were looking inside through the peephole of the door!

55
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:18,353
I was just fooling around.

56
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:21,353
I thought that if anyone peeped out the hole he would be surprised.

57
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:23,853
Besides, even if you were to look inside from the hole,

58
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:25,753
you can't see what's inside.

59
00:04:25,753 --> 00:04:28,653
But, your hair's funny too!

60
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:30,553
This is...

61
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:33,653
I left my dyed brown hair as is, and this is how it ended up.

62
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:35,453
So you say,

63
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:38,253
but I'll bet you came because it bothered you.

64
00:04:38,253 --> 00:04:41,253
Like they say, perps return to the scene of the crime.

65
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:46,053
Perp? What do you mean perp?

66
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:48,553
Is it true that he was looking inside?

67
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:49,953
Yeah.

68
00:04:49,953 --> 00:04:52,853
After this person pushed the doorbell.

69
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:55,253
That voice? Is it you, Yasuie?

70
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,753
Dad.

71
00:04:58,253 --> 00:04:59,653
"Yasuie Itami (22)" -Which means...

72
00:04:59,653 --> 00:05:01,153
"Naganobu's son" -He's his son!

73
00:05:02,653 --> 00:05:03,753
"Naganobu Itami (52)" -What's up?

74
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:06,153
"Flat resident" -Weren't you at driving school?

75
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:07,753
I played hooky.

76
00:05:07,753 --> 00:05:10,053
I wanted to show you the car catalogs as soon as possible.

77
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:11,653
Cars my foot!

78
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:14,153
Do that after you find yourself a job!

79
00:05:14,153 --> 00:05:15,453
What's with you?

80
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:18,353
You agreed about me taking a driver's license, didn't you, Dad?

81
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:21,753
You could never pass with that pudding-like hair!

82
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:25,453
Dad. What're you so upset about?

83
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:29,153
The cops are here too. What the heck's going on?

84
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:30,953
The fact is...

85
00:05:30,953 --> 00:05:33,753
What? Mom committed suicide?

86
00:05:33,753 --> 00:05:36,153
Oh, no! Why?

87
00:05:36,153 --> 00:05:39,553
Although there's still the possibility that she was killed.

88
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:41,653
Killed?

89
00:05:41,653 --> 00:05:43,553
Come to think of it,

90
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:46,053
it seems you came here once today already?

91
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:47,753
Yeah.

92
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:49,653
To show these catalogs.

93
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:52,853
But since there was no answer after pushing the doorbell,

94
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,953
I figured they were out shopping

95
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:57,153
or something so I killed time walking around and stuff,

96
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:58,953
then came back.

97
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:00,253
I see.

98
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:02,353
Is there anyone who can testify for you?

99
00:06:02,353 --> 00:06:04,353
Hey, Inspector.

100
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:06,553
Don't tell me you're suspecting me?

101
00:06:06,553 --> 00:06:09,353
Somebody's cell phone is ringing.

102
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:16,153
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:16,153 --> 00:06:18,253
It was my cell phone!

104
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,553
Oh boy.

105
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:23,553
But, all three of you are using the same type of cell phone?

106
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:27,153
Yeah. This model is popular.

107
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,853
The color of the covers is different

108
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:30,553
so we don't mistake one for the other.

109
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:33,753
Talking of cell phones,

110
00:06:33,753 --> 00:06:35,953
before finding Mrs. Itami's cell phone,

111
00:06:35,953 --> 00:06:40,653
Sakurako you said that you heard the bedroom door close, right?

112
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:42,253
Yes.

113
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:45,753
How did you know that the sound you heard was the door of the bedroom?

114
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:48,153
You can't see it from the front entrance, can you?

115
00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:51,153
All the other doors were a bit opened.

116
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:52,453
I thought they were closed before.

117
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,353
I went out shopping though.

118
00:06:54,353 --> 00:06:58,353
Then, wasn't the bedroom window a bit opened too?

119
00:06:58,353 --> 00:07:00,153
How do you know?

120
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:03,353
Were you with her right through while shopping?

121
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:07,553
No, I was in the smoking area until she finished shopping.

122
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:11,053
Which means you don't have an alibi either.

123
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:13,453
Were you at home right through, Mr. Haneda?

124
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:15,453
No, I was out.

125
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:18,453
As soon as I got home, the police woman pushed my doorbell.

126
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:21,053
"Shukichi Haneda (28)" -Where and what were you doing?

127
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:22,453
"Flat resident" -Well...

128
00:07:22,453 --> 00:07:25,053
Hey! Come on and spit it out!

129
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:28,753
I can't tell you.

130
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:33,753
Just what are you talking about, Chukichi?

131
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,953
You're being suspected as a murderer, you know?

132
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:39,053
Come on, spit it out!

133
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:41,453
Or, you'll end up being the perp?

134
00:07:41,453 --> 00:07:43,953
Don't worry, Yumi baby.

135
00:07:43,953 --> 00:07:48,353
This case is already checkmated.

136
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:51,156
Listen, you guys!

137
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:53,856
It should be somewhere in this neighborhood, okay?

138
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:56,156
If you find it, show the person who is nearby

139
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:59,756
the picture that I sent you a while ago!

140
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:00,756
Yes.

141
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:03,256
-I'm counting on you, then! -Aye...

142
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:04,756
Yes, yes.

143
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:06,056
Inspector Megure!

144
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:08,356
I've got the result of the handwriting analysis!

145
00:08:08,356 --> 00:08:09,956
Is that so?

146
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,456
Although the handwriting is pretty messy,

147
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:17,156
the will seems to have undoubtedly been written by Mrs. Chiyoko Itami.

148
00:08:17,156 --> 00:08:18,356
What?

149
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:21,856
Could she have been threatened by the perp to write it?

150
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:24,056
No, being that messy,

151
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:27,556
I'm sure that the perp would've made her rewrite it.

152
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:30,456
And the housemaid was frequently displayed

153
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:33,356
in the surveillance camera of the supermarket,

154
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:36,256
so her alibi has been established.

155
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:40,656
However, Mr. Itami who went shopping with her

156
00:08:40,656 --> 00:08:42,256
wasn't displayed anywhere.

157
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:44,656
Like I said, I was in the smoking area

158
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:47,756
Which means then, that the three suspects are, Mr. Itami

159
00:08:47,756 --> 00:08:51,656
and one who came here once, rang the doorbell,

160
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,256
but since there was no answer,

161
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:55,156
went out to kill time and came back again,

162
00:08:55,156 --> 00:08:59,256
his son Yasuie and me, who was out during this time,

163
00:08:59,256 --> 00:09:04,156
but would not tell you where I was.

164
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:07,856
Geez, do you know how you're making yourself look?

165
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:12,456
Like I said, I'll tell you where I was at a later time.

166
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:15,556
What? Is it something you can't say in front of me?

167
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:16,756
It's a woman, isn't it?

168
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,756
I'll bet you were meeting some woman somewhere!

169
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:20,456
No way!

170
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:21,656
Like I told you,

171
00:09:21,656 --> 00:09:24,056
you're the only one for me, Yumi baby.

172
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:26,256
What a nuisance.

173
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:27,256
Inspector!

174
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:28,856
It's okay already,

175
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:30,656
he's the perp so hurry and handcuff him!

176
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:34,456
-What? -But, Yumi...

177
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:37,056
Although there are several dubious points,

178
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:39,556
when Mr. Itami and the housemaid came home

179
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:41,556
and entered the front door,

180
00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:44,756
they heard the door of this bedroom close,

181
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:49,256
and Mrs. Itami was found dead hanging here.

182
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,256
If the will that was found by her feet

183
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:53,756
is something that she herself had written,

184
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:55,656
there is no other possibility than this being a suicide.

185
00:09:55,656 --> 00:09:58,356
The one prepared move.

186
00:09:58,356 --> 00:10:02,356
That will was it, wasn't it, Mr. Haneda?

187
00:10:02,356 --> 00:10:04,056
Come to think of it,

188
00:10:04,056 --> 00:10:05,756
you were saying something to that effect, weren't you, Chukichi?

189
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:07,956
What on earth was that? Just what did you mean?

190
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:11,456
Beats me? Did I say something like that?

191
00:10:12,656 --> 00:10:14,956
When one assumes a certain situation,

192
00:10:14,956 --> 00:10:17,656
and when that assumed situation comes to be,

193
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:19,756
the brilliant move that is made then, is called,

194
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:21,856
the "one prepared move."

195
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:24,056
I saw this written on the internet.

196
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,556
It comes from shogi terminology.

197
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:28,356
Shogi terminology?

198
00:10:28,356 --> 00:10:31,556
How come you know of something like that Chukichi?

199
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:35,256
By the way, was that will the "one prepared move"?

200
00:10:35,256 --> 00:10:38,956
Didn't you think the he contents of that will was strange?

201
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:41,956
What was written on it was,

202
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:44,256
"I'm sorry to have wounded you.

203
00:10:44,256 --> 00:10:46,656
I pray that you will get well soon.

204
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:48,756
Yasuie, good luck on your exam,

205
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:50,556
I'm sure you'll pass.

206
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:52,556
Please let Ichiko wear my dressy kimono

207
00:10:52,556 --> 00:10:55,256
when time to celebrate Shichigosan comes.

208
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:56,556
Please forgive me for crossing over

209
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,056
before all of you and leaving you behind.

210
00:10:58,056 --> 00:11:00,056
Chiyoko Itami"

211
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:01,456
What's strange about this?

212
00:11:01,456 --> 00:11:03,356
The exam part.

213
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:10,056
Yasuie was scheduled to take a written driver's test.

214
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:13,856
It's not a test so hard as to have to pray for.

215
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:16,656
She was a worrier, you see.

216
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:21,056
In fact, she was really worried about our son who is graduating soon,

217
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,356
but still doesn't have a job.

218
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:27,356
Right, Yasuie is now a senior at the university.

219
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:29,056
If that will were to be something that she had written four years ago

220
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:33,256
when her son was going to take the university exam,

221
00:11:33,256 --> 00:11:35,956
wouldn't everything fall into place?

222
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:39,656
Very true, four years ago.

223
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:44,756
If it were four years ago, her niece would've been 3 years old,

224
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:46,956
the youngest age to celebrate Shichigosan.

225
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:51,756
Mrs. Itami showed me that picture the other day.

226
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:54,656
She pointed at the girl wearing a dressy kimono and said.

227
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:59,156
"This doesn't look like a kimono made 40 years ago, does it?"

228
00:11:59,156 --> 00:12:02,756
Then, don't tell me that the will was really written four years ago?

229
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:05,056
That's ridiculous? I showed you, didn't I?

230
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:06,456
This bruise by my eye.

231
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:10,856
I got this wound last night when my wife threw an ashtray at me.

232
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,656
If that's written on the will then...

233
00:12:12,656 --> 00:12:14,056
Talking of wounds...

234
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:17,756
I remember you said some time ago, that you broke your leg.

235
00:12:17,756 --> 00:12:19,956
Yeah.

236
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:23,356
Because my mother who was a beginner at skiing crashed into Dad.

237
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:25,256
She told me that because of this accident

238
00:12:25,256 --> 00:12:29,256
she always ended up having to go to the annual family New Year's party

239
00:12:29,256 --> 00:12:31,856
held in our hometown, alone by plane,

240
00:12:31,856 --> 00:12:33,456
in which she almost lost her life.

241
00:12:33,456 --> 00:12:35,856
So, that was four years ago too?

242
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:39,356
If that plane was about to crash,

243
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:42,156
it's not strange that she wrote the will on board the plane

244
00:12:42,156 --> 00:12:45,756
to her family that she thought she would be leaving behind.

245
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:47,056
I see!

246
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:50,056
That's why the will was so messily written!

247
00:12:50,056 --> 00:12:52,856
Because she wrote it on board a turbulent plane about to crash.

248
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,256
I see.

249
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:58,556
That's why she went out of her way to write her full name on it,

250
00:12:58,556 --> 00:13:01,656
in case someone were to have found it at the crash site.

251
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,556
If the perp got a hold of this,

252
00:13:04,556 --> 00:13:06,756
and used it to commit this crime four years later.

253
00:13:06,756 --> 00:13:10,156
It would indeed be the "One prepared move."

254
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,156
It's a mystery still that when Mr. Itami and the housemaid came home,

255
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:16,156
he door of the bedroom slammed shut, though.

256
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:17,156
Yeah.

257
00:13:17,156 --> 00:13:23,056
Maybe the perp was still hiding in the bedroom at that time?

258
00:13:23,056 --> 00:13:25,256
I don't think so.

259
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:28,456
When I came home, I locked the front door

260
00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:30,456
and when Conan first came,

261
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:32,656
the door was still locked.

262
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:35,256
Then why did the door?

263
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:38,056
It couldn't possibly have closed on its own.

264
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:42,456
Hey, who is it? How rough!

265
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:45,656
Is it you, Officer Chiba?

266
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,556
Hey, Conan.

267
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:50,556
Are you the one who just closed this door?

268
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:51,956
What're you talking about?

269
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,456
I just opened the front door

270
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:56,856
to confirm whether my friends came back or not.

271
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:59,856
And, I did leave the window of the bedroom slightly opened!

272
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:02,556
The heater was too hot, so...

273
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:04,256
When Mrs. Itami's corpse was found,

274
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:06,556
the window was a bit opened too, wasn't it?

275
00:14:06,556 --> 00:14:09,256
-Is that true? -Yes.

276
00:14:09,256 --> 00:14:11,656
Mr. Itami said that he feels sorry for his wife feeling cold,

277
00:14:11,656 --> 00:14:14,256
so he closed it right away though.

278
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:16,256
That's it!

279
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,556
Because the front door opened,

280
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:22,356
the warm air inside the room gushed out the window,

281
00:14:22,356 --> 00:14:25,256
and the bedroom door closed!

282
00:14:25,256 --> 00:14:27,156
So, the perp, in order to make this happen,

283
00:14:27,156 --> 00:14:30,356
left the bedroom window and door open.

284
00:14:30,356 --> 00:14:33,356
But then, the bedroom door would slam shut

285
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:36,856
when the perp opens the front door to flee.

286
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:38,556
Isn't that right?

287
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:39,556
Come to think of it,

288
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:40,956
Mrs. Itami's cell phone was on the floor

289
00:14:40,956 --> 00:14:43,556
in front of the door of the bedroom, right?

290
00:14:43,556 --> 00:14:44,656
Yes.

291
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:46,256
Then...

292
00:14:46,256 --> 00:14:48,656
If you stick the cell phone between the door,

293
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:50,456
won't that leave the door open?

294
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:53,756
See! Like this!

295
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:57,056
But, it'll stay open right through that way, no?

296
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:58,856
No good after all?

297
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,056
If legs were on the cell phone

298
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:04,956
and it moved around like an animal, it seems possible.

299
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:07,456
I see! The vibe of the cell phone!

300
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:10,656
The perp stuck the cell phone between the door,

301
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:12,756
left the room and called that cell phone from outside.

302
00:15:12,756 --> 00:15:14,056
The cell phone that was set on vibe, vibrated when called

303
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:16,556
and dropped to the floor.

304
00:15:16,556 --> 00:15:20,056
But, there were no history for incoming calls on Mrs. Itami's cell phone

305
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:22,056
that was on the floor in front of the door.

306
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:24,356
Maybe that's not your wife's?

307
00:15:26,356 --> 00:15:29,356
Because although the color of the covers is different,

308
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:31,156
all three in the family have cell phones of the same model!

309
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:34,556
It's not strange if you were to mistake

310
00:15:34,556 --> 00:15:36,056
your own cell phone for hers, is it?

311
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:37,356
I see.

312
00:15:37,356 --> 00:15:39,956
If you were to take off the cover from your wife's cell phone,

313
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:42,356
and put it onto yours,

314
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:44,956
you could lie and say that it's your own.

315
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:47,856
If you were to use that cell phone to carry out that trick,

316
00:15:47,856 --> 00:15:51,956
then after switch the cover back again before turning it in,

317
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:56,956
it would look like Mrs. Itami's phone had nothing to do with the crime.

318
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,056
And the only person who could do this

319
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:01,756
is the one who had Mrs. Itami's cell phone

320
00:16:01,756 --> 00:16:04,156
until it was time to turn it in to us...

321
00:16:04,156 --> 00:16:07,856
you, her husband, Mr. Itami.

322
00:16:09,756 --> 00:16:11,356
While the housemaid was shopping,

323
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:14,656
you probably went home once, strangled your wife,

324
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:17,856
hung her from the ceiling,

325
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:20,356
put the will that was written four years at her feet,

326
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:22,356
opened the window to the bedroom,

327
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,956
stuck the cell phone between the door,

328
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:26,256
and left the scene.

329
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:29,256
Then, you called the cell phone from outside

330
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:32,456
to use vibe to drop the cell phone from between the door,

331
00:16:32,456 --> 00:16:35,556
then joined the housemaid and returned home once again

332
00:16:35,556 --> 00:16:40,356
to make it look as if Mrs. Itami had committed suicide.

333
00:16:40,356 --> 00:16:42,456
After returning home,

334
00:16:42,456 --> 00:16:44,656
you didn't go straight into the bedroom

335
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:46,156
and discover the corpse in order to hide the fact

336
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:49,456
that some time had passed since the corpse had been hung.

337
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:51,056
Then, the suspicious character

338
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:53,256
that the concierge on first floor said he saw was

339
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:55,156
Mr. Itami.

340
00:16:55,156 --> 00:16:59,156
He probably had change of clothes hidden in the restroom or something

341
00:16:59,156 --> 00:17:01,656
Well, we can easily figure it out

342
00:17:01,656 --> 00:17:03,056
if we look at your cell phone as to that.

343
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,256
Now that you mentioned it,

344
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,156
when I was in the smoking area of the supermarket, my phone rang...

345
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:08,656
Who was it?

346
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:11,856
It seemed to have been a wrong number call.

347
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:15,856
I found a public phone!

348
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:18,556
It was in front of a convenience store nearby!

349
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:21,156
We asked the manager the picture of Mr. Itami,

350
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:24,056
and he told us that he was sneakily talking on t he phone!

351
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:26,156
Well, since there aren't too many people

352
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:28,456
who use the public phone nowadays

353
00:17:28,456 --> 00:17:31,156
maybe fingerprints can be found on it?

354
00:17:31,156 --> 00:17:32,656
So she says!

355
00:17:35,256 --> 00:17:37,956
But, is it true, Dad?

356
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,756
Did you really kill Mom?

357
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:45,856
I thought that luck had finally come around for me.

358
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,956
To tell the truth, I really contemplated

359
00:17:47,956 --> 00:17:51,456
on whether or not I should carry out this murder scheme.

360
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:53,756
Until last night, that is...

361
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:55,556
Hey, Chiyoko!

362
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:57,956
I told you to cut out doing stocks, didn't I?

363
00:17:57,956 --> 00:18:00,856
Although we're telling Yasuie that he can't have a car,

364
00:18:00,856 --> 00:18:03,556
at heart we both actually want to get him one, no?

365
00:18:03,556 --> 00:18:05,056
Just what are you talking about?

366
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:07,456
Our debts are ballooning too, you know.

367
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:09,256
I've figured it out!

368
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:13,456
God doesn't smile on me until I'm really cornered.

369
00:18:13,456 --> 00:18:17,656
That's why I mortgaged this condo and borrowed money.

370
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:22,156
After that we got into an awful argument and...

371
00:18:22,156 --> 00:18:24,856
When the ashtray that Chiyoko threw hit my eye,

372
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:27,056
I felt a flash electricity go through me.

373
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:29,356
It dawned on me that under these circumstances

374
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:31,556
I could use the will that I had previously found

375
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:36,156
to carry out the murder plan

376
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,856
felt that God was on my side.

377
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,156
Did you by any chance, know who the perp was?

378
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:48,256
I was suspicious about the will,

379
00:18:48,256 --> 00:18:50,456
but maybe was convinced after hearing the conversation

380
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:53,156
between the father and son at the front door.

381
00:18:53,156 --> 00:18:56,556
You could never pass with that pudding-like hair!

382
00:18:56,556 --> 00:19:01,156
He knew what his son's hair looked like under the cap

383
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:03,956
he was wearing despite not having seen him for 2 years,

384
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:05,756
only because when he was hanging his wife,

385
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:07,756
the doorbell rang, and saw what his son looked like

386
00:19:07,756 --> 00:19:09,956
after looking through the peep hole of the door.

387
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:12,256
But if his son had kept his cap on,

388
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:13,756
he couldn't have seen it, no?

389
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:20,856
The son likes peeking back through the peephole.

390
00:19:23,856 --> 00:19:25,656
If you're wearing a cap with a brim,

391
00:19:25,656 --> 00:19:28,256
you can't look into the peep hole unless you take it off, right?

392
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:55,856
He sure was a dense looking guy, don't you think?

393
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:58,256
You're talking about Yumi's ex, right?

394
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,156
I was imagining a more "host" like person

395
00:21:00,156 --> 00:21:03,556
when I previously heard of him, though.

396
00:21:03,556 --> 00:21:04,956
Well, but all's well, I'd say,

397
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:06,256
because he seems to be clever

398
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:09,556
and helped solve the case this time.

399
00:21:09,556 --> 00:21:12,356
Yeah, I got kind of nervous too,

400
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,256
being able to make deductions along with such a famous person.

401
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:16,056
Famous?

402
00:21:16,056 --> 00:21:19,256
Was there any actor by the name Shukichi Haneda?

403
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:20,656
See this person!

404
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:21,756
Master of Shogi Taiko,

405
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:24,456
congratulations to your winning the 4 major titles!

406
00:21:24,456 --> 00:21:26,556
Hey, it's the Master of Shogi, Taiko!

407
00:21:26,556 --> 00:21:28,556
My mother's a great fan of his too!

408
00:21:28,556 --> 00:21:31,656
But what does the master have to do with him?

409
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:33,456
Take a good look at him.

410
00:21:35,356 --> 00:21:39,056
I guess you can say that the opposing rooks went well today.

411
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,356
This tousled hair...

412
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:49,256
It's him!

413
00:21:50,956 --> 00:21:52,356
I see.

414
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:54,656
The kanji character of his name resembles that of Hideyoshi Hashiba,

415
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:55,956
that's why he's called Taiko.

416
00:21:55,956 --> 00:22:00,556
Yeah. He was actually at the Shogi tournament hall that day,

417
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:01,856
for the preliminary game,

418
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:03,256
but it seems he didn't say anything about it

419
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,756
because he didn't want Yumi to find out that he was a Shogi player.

420
00:22:05,756 --> 00:22:07,756
Cut why not? A master of Shogi is awesome!

421
00:22:07,756 --> 00:22:11,356
If so, what are the seven things he's collecting?

422
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:14,756
Well, when it comes to seven in Shogi...

423
00:22:18,356 --> 00:22:20,256
"Many years ago"

424
00:22:21,956 --> 00:22:24,656
Yumi, I did it!

425
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:27,656
I got the title of Shogi Master that I've been longing for!

426
00:22:27,656 --> 00:22:29,856
Yumi baby.

427
00:22:29,856 --> 00:22:32,856
Gee whizz! You're late, Chukichi!

428
00:22:32,856 --> 00:22:33,956
I'm sorry, so sorry.

429
00:22:33,956 --> 00:22:36,456
The battle took longer than I expected.

430
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:38,556
Were playing a game or something?

431
00:22:38,556 --> 00:22:41,856
Oh, no, I guess you could call it a game but...

432
00:22:41,856 --> 00:22:45,256
-The thing is today I... -Hey, take a look at this news!

433
00:22:45,256 --> 00:22:46,456
News?

434
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:49,756
Yokozuna Tenho won the summer tournament

435
00:22:49,756 --> 00:22:52,856
and ended up winning 6 consecutive sumo tournaments.

436
00:22:52,856 --> 00:22:54,556
He's fantastic, don't you think?

437
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:57,556
To keep winning for an entire year!

438
00:22:57,556 --> 00:23:00,756
I guess if a prince-like person like him were to be your husband,

439
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:03,956
the wife would feel like a princess.

440
00:23:05,156 --> 00:23:06,556
Don't worry,

441
00:23:06,556 --> 00:23:09,956
I have no such expectations when it comes to you.

442
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:12,556
Gio, Osho,

443
00:23:12,556 --> 00:23:15,956
Oza, Kisei, Ooi,

444
00:23:15,956 --> 00:23:18,756
Ryuo, Meijin!

445
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:22,156
The 7 major titles!

446
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:26,656
What? Chukichi is a Master Shogi player?

447
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,556
Yes!

448
00:23:28,556 --> 00:23:32,356
He is indeed... I'll bet you mean the master of fishing

449
00:23:32,356 --> 00:23:33,856
or a game or something like that, right?

450
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:35,556
It's just like him...

451
00:23:46,156 --> 00:23:48,956
The groom is lying on the ground!

452
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:54,156
In other words,

453
00:23:54,156 --> 00:23:59,456
we think that the same perp committed both crimes.

454
00:23:59,456 --> 00:24:03,556
I see. If that's used...

455
00:24:03,556 --> 00:24:04,856
