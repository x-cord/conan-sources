00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:23,090
Today marks the 10th year for the Detective Conan Series.

2
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:24,390
In the first episode of this commemorative year,

3
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,090
of all things, Pop's becomes the target of a sniper.

4
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:27,490
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:29,290
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,991
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:00,220
Are you all right?

8
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,320
Shall I go flag a cab down?

9
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:06,020
I'm just fine.

10
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:07,520
Thanks for the service and goodnight.

11
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:09,220
Take care and goodnight.

12
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:10,720
Please be careful.

13
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:12,121
Goodnight.

14
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:53,820
Hey, watch out!

15
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:55,921
You're lucky it was me because I was able to dodge it.

16
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:06,520
"The Target is Kogoro Mouri."

17
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,921
Hey! Stay still.

18
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:13,020
It stings, Ran.

19
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:15,420
Can't you do it a bit more gently and softly?

20
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:19,320
Oh, come on! It's nothing to make such a big deal out of, Dad.

21
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:21,320
A little sting won't kill you.

22
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:24,521
I've got to go and caution the person in charge tomorrow.

23
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:29,021
Who could it be at this time of night?

24
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:33,220
What is this?

25
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,921
It's mail.

26
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:37,220
What?

27
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:39,021
Dad, what's up?

28
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,320
Huh?

29
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,921
It says, "I won't fail next time. I'll kill you for sure."

30
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:48,620
Does this mean that it was no accident,

31
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:50,620
but something that happened with the intent to kill?

32
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,920
What a dirty rat.

33
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:55,720
The culprit was ambushing me there.

34
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:59,020
Dad, don't you have any idea who it could be?

35
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,320
No, not the slightest.

36
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:03,620
Well, I guess you can't really say

37
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:05,920
that there's no one who has a grudge against me.

38
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:07,420
You think someone repaid your kindness with a grudge?

39
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:10,920
Yes. If so, we'll find out soon who it is.

40
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:13,220
The culprit must always has a motive.

41
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:15,720
This time, it's a grudge against me.

42
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:17,820
If I search for those who have a grudge against me,

43
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:20,920
it'll inevitably lead to the culprit.

44
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:24,520
Hey, this cell phone is not yours, Dad.

45
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:26,220
-What? -Huh?

46
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:27,820
Show it to me.

47
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:29,420
True.

48
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:33,020
Hey! This jacket isn't yours either, Dad.

49
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:34,620
What?

50
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:36,520
There's a name on it.

51
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:38,020
Kimura.

52
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:41,220
In other words, this cell phone is not yours,

53
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:43,820
but rather of someone name Kimura.

54
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:47,420
Which means this mail was not sent to me.

55
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:50,820
So that's the story. No fun.

56
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:52,121
Hey. Just where do you think you're going?

57
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:56,420
I'm going to sleep.

58
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,521
There you go.

59
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:02,420
It hurts.

60
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:03,721
Conan?

61
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:07,121
What a sight.

62
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:12,220
Hey. What do you think, Conan?

63
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:14,720
You mean if there's anything besides the fact that Pop's life is in danger

64
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:17,220
because he mistakenly wore Mr. Kimura's jacket

65
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:19,420
and the killer mistook Pops to be Mr. Kimura?

66
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:23,021
Right, I'll try and call Dad's cell phone.

67
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:29,320
I wonder what kind of person the owner of the cell phone is.

68
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:31,421
There's no answer.

69
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:38,520
This is unmistakably Mr. Kimura's jacket.

70
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:40,620
Did Mr. Kimura come last night?

71
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:44,320
He came when Mr. Mouri was asleep over there.

72
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:46,620
I think it was around 1am.

73
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:50,620
And where is this Mr. Kimura living?

74
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:54,621
I wonder? He's only started coming here recently, so...

75
00:05:56,121 --> 00:06:00,120
As for me, I found out his name from his signature on this bottle.

76
00:06:00,121 --> 00:06:02,420
Is that so?

77
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:05,620
I'm sure he'll show up sometime soon.

78
00:06:05,621 --> 00:06:08,120
Let's forget about this for a while.

79
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:09,620
Do you have it?

80
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:13,320
The hand-made cheese that this master makes is super spicy.

81
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:17,520
It blows up your cells, makes your body hot and sweaty.

82
00:06:17,521 --> 00:06:20,420
One should refrain from eating too much of it, but that's just impossible.

83
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,620
That's how good it is.

84
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:23,720
I see.

85
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,521
So that's why he took off his jacket.

86
00:06:26,621 --> 00:06:29,820
After checking the cell phone that sent out the mail last night,

87
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:32,620
we found that it was registered under a false name.

88
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:35,420
And from last night up to now there have been no accidents

89
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:39,820
in which a man by the name of Kimura has been involved.

90
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:42,220
It's probably just some prank.

91
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:47,020
The police are busy so you shouldn't cause them extra problems, Ran.

92
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:48,520
But...

93
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:51,820
Besides, they're not after me. But a man named Kimura.

94
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:54,920
The culprit made a mistake.

95
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:58,020
But if the culprit doesn't realize that he's making a mistake,

96
00:06:58,021 --> 00:07:01,620
he'll go after your life again.

97
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,221
That's what Ran is worried about.

98
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:10,521
Officer Takagi, don't take what a kid like her is saying too seriously.

99
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:14,420
Bar Lemon, right?

100
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:17,221
You sure go looking for all kinds of places to drink, don't you?

101
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:25,420
About a week ago,

102
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:30,220
I was able to get the service coupons at their grand opening.

103
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:31,320
So I went to check the place out.

104
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:34,220
They served this super spicy hot cheese along with the drinks.

105
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,620
Since I've kind of been hooked on spicy hot stuff lately,

106
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:39,120
I got hooked on this place, you see.

107
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:40,920
-Officer Takagi. -Yes!

108
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:42,420
There's been an eye-witness report.

109
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,620
Last night a student living near the construction site

110
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:49,920
says he saw a man running from the scene right after the steel pipes fell.

111
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:52,620
He says he didn't get a good look at the face of the man though.

112
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:55,421
However, the culprit seems to have had a burn wound on his right elbow.

113
00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:59,021
Do you have any idea who the man could be?

114
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:03,920
Unfortunately, there were no other suspicious fingerprints

115
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:06,520
or anything else at the site.

116
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:10,820
Which means, you'll have to find Mr. Kimura and trace things from there.

117
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:14,020
Dad! You're talking like it's someone else's problem,

118
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:16,121
-but what it all boil's down to is... -I'm not Mr. Kimura.

119
00:08:18,121 --> 00:08:20,920
This all happened because you went to that bar.

120
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:24,420
Pops! Unless we hurry, the man called Kimura may be attacked again

121
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,221
and get into bigger trouble next time.

122
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:30,720
Mr. Kimura...

123
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:32,720
Since the size of this jacket fits Dad just right,

124
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,220
I think he has the same type of physique as Dad.

125
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:37,820
Have you ever kept his jacket for him?

126
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,220
There is no such person at our shop.

127
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:41,821
I see.

128
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:49,021
Look out!

129
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:53,321
Ran!

130
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:01,621
Darn it!

131
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,521
Hold it there!

132
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,321
A burn on his right elbow?

133
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:35,720
The truck was a stolen one after all.

134
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:39,020
Which means it was a planned attempt.

135
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:40,421
I think so, too.

136
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:49,021
What's up, Mr. Mouri?

137
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:52,021
"Kimura. Next time, I will kill you for sure."

138
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:59,020
Inspector! The laundry shop owner has completed being treated.

139
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:01,220
They say he'll be discharged in two or three days.

140
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:04,320
How dare he get others who aren't involved into danger.

141
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:06,520
Mr. Mouri, just where do you plan on going?

142
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:10,020
Where else? I want to nab that guy.

143
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:12,120
Come on, you don't even know where he is.

144
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,920
Just where do you plan to look for him?

145
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:15,320
Mr. Mouri.

146
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:19,320
Who cares? I'll find him with my spirit.

147
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:21,520
Just what are you talking about?

148
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,120
Please stay in one place until we find the culprit.

149
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:26,920
They're right. Somebody's after you life, you know.

150
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:28,820
I can't do that.

151
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:31,120
I, the world famous Kogoro Mouri

152
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:35,420
hiding just because he's scared of having his life take away.

153
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:37,820
It'd ruin my reputation.

154
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:40,420
Come off it! You don't have to bluff courage.

155
00:10:40,421 --> 00:10:41,921
Right, Conan?

156
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:45,620
Bluff courage?

157
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:49,120
You actually think I'm bluffing courage or what?

158
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:50,820
You've got to be kidding!

159
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:54,520
Somebody's after my life you say?

160
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,820
Just great.

161
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:58,820
What better chance could there be?

162
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:02,520
As long as we don't know who this Kimura guy is,

163
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:06,420
I'll serve as decoy and lure the culprit out.

164
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:09,120
Wait a minute! Just what do you think you're saying, Mr. Mouri?

165
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:12,421
I can't stop him if I keep on hiding.

166
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:16,520
-Okay. -Inspector!

167
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:20,120
But I'm going to have those two serve as your bodyguards.

168
00:11:20,121 --> 00:11:21,720
No way.

169
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:23,920
It'll only put the culprit on guard if he finds out

170
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:25,020
and he won't show himself.

171
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:26,120
No!

172
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:28,220
Going out alone is much too dangerous.

173
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,320
I hate to say this, inspector.

174
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:32,420
But I can't listen to you this time.

175
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:37,420
I can't bear and don't want any more victims resulting from this.

176
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:39,620
But if anything should happen to me,

177
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:42,521
please take care of what needs to be done after that.

178
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:45,820
Mr. Mouri.

179
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:48,120
It seemed to have the opposite effect.

180
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:50,621
-Mr. Mouri. -He's quite defiant.

181
00:11:53,321 --> 00:12:01,020
So what we've got to do now is to find the person called Kimura.

182
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,220
Yes, sir.

183
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,420
Let's go, Officer Takagi.

184
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:04,521
Okay!

185
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:26,120
He's been walking around for the past three days.

186
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,620
Yes, sir.

187
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,620
And what about this Mr. Kimura?

188
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:33,420
We're still looking. We're doing everything we can.

189
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:36,020
But if the motive of the culprit is a grudge against Mr. Mouri,

190
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,120
I guess we'll eventually get the guy.

191
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:42,420
But the thing is, he's being sought after mistaken for a man named Kimura,

192
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:45,820
and he has no idea who or where this Kimura person is.

193
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:47,720
Moreover, after two attempted tries on Mr. Mouri's life,

194
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:51,220
the culprit left nothing behind, not even fingerprints.

195
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:52,920
I really hate to say this

196
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:56,320
but at present we're up the creek without a paddle.

197
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:57,720
Fingerprints.

198
00:12:57,721 --> 00:13:00,820
He didn't want to get nabbed from his fingerprints?

199
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,520
So the culprit's fingerprints are already registered?

200
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:06,320
Which means, this person has an arrest record.

201
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:08,620
One who knows Pops well.

202
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,620
But he has no motive against Pops.

203
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:12,720
Wait a second.

204
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:15,721
If the culprit knows Pops and has met him before...

205
00:13:17,821 --> 00:13:19,421
It could be that...

206
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:25,953
This is Mouri. Long time no see.

207
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:27,553
I'd like to ask you something

208
00:13:27,554 --> 00:13:30,754
about a certain case that I solved in the past.

209
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,354
What's all the noise outside?

210
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:40,653
Come on out.

211
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,653
I know that you're hiding over there.

212
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:48,153
I advise you to come out before I crush you to a pulp.

213
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:50,053
There's nothing to think about, is there?

214
00:13:50,054 --> 00:13:51,853
Resign yourself and come on out.

215
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:53,853
Come out. Or else I'm going to come get you.

216
00:13:53,854 --> 00:13:56,053
No, please don't. Please forgive me.

217
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:59,953
I'm sorry. I will return what I stole.

218
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:01,553
Dad.

219
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:03,553
What? What's going on?

220
00:14:03,554 --> 00:14:06,754
You're fantastic, Dad. It's a robber. Good job!

221
00:14:09,854 --> 00:14:12,953
A case in which luck and coincidence overlapped.

222
00:14:12,954 --> 00:14:15,453
Why don't you rest a while, Conan?

223
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,353
I wonder if that person called Kimura not only resembles dad in physique,

224
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:20,953
but looks alike, too.

225
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:23,453
Because don't they say that there are three people

226
00:14:23,454 --> 00:14:25,254
who resemble you existing in this world?

227
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:28,454
Three people with a face like his?

228
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:31,854
People who look alike.

229
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:37,653
Yes, I got a call from Mr. Kimura's wife.

230
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:41,053
And it seems she realized that her husband was wearing the wrong jacket.

231
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,553
Talk about easygoing.

232
00:14:42,554 --> 00:14:45,753
Mr. Kimura seems to have gone out to take pictures.

233
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:50,253
Yes, sir. And Mr. Mouri, Mrs. Kimura just happened to say

234
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:54,553
that a strange man was checking out their house.

235
00:14:54,554 --> 00:14:56,553
He had a wound on his right elbow?

236
00:14:56,554 --> 00:14:58,953
And, where is Mr. Kimura?

237
00:14:58,954 --> 00:14:59,954
Lake Beika?

238
00:14:59,955 --> 00:15:01,853
The strange man is trailing him.

239
00:15:01,854 --> 00:15:04,753
Okay, it's very likely.

240
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:07,453
Are you going there too, Mr. Mouri?

241
00:15:07,454 --> 00:15:09,853
I think that's dangerous.

242
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:11,854
What a short-tempered man.

243
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,553
Money?

244
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:26,353
I dropped it and it went under the car.

245
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:29,553
Okay! I'll move the car and look for it.

246
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,654
Really? I'm glad. Thank you!

247
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:37,254
Just as I thought.

248
00:15:45,954 --> 00:15:47,554
Manicure?

249
00:15:48,554 --> 00:15:50,253
I found it.

250
00:15:50,254 --> 00:15:51,854
Thank you, sir.

251
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:55,553
Inspector? This is Kogoro.

252
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,753
I've found out where Mr. Kimura is.

253
00:15:57,754 --> 00:15:59,253
What?

254
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:02,453
Mr. Kimura, where are you?

255
00:16:02,454 --> 00:16:05,953
Please answer me, Mr. Kimura!

256
00:16:05,954 --> 00:16:08,954
Hey, it's cold here. So hurry up and show yourself.

257
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:15,553
Yes, this is Kogoro.

258
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:17,553
Oh, Inspector!

259
00:16:17,554 --> 00:16:21,153
I've found out where Mr. Kimura is. He's by the thicket.

260
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:23,654
And Mr. Mouri, take care not to catch cold because it's cold.

261
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,554
Hurry! Hurry!

262
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:38,354
Mr. Kimura! Mr. Kimura!

263
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:47,054
Mr. Kimura!

264
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:52,753
Inspector! Isn't that Mr. Mouri on board that boat?

265
00:16:52,754 --> 00:16:53,953
It is Mr. Mouri!

266
00:16:53,954 --> 00:16:55,953
He's out there in clear view with nothing to protect him.

267
00:16:55,954 --> 00:16:58,954
He has no chance against the sniper! Talk about reckless!

268
00:17:07,254 --> 00:17:08,254
Inspector.

269
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:11,153
On the left side of the lakeside opposite here, something glittered.

270
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:13,253
What? It's a rifle.

271
00:17:13,254 --> 00:17:15,653
It could be the rifle of the sniper who is after Mr. Mouri's life!

272
00:17:15,654 --> 00:17:17,653
-Hurry, Takagi. -Yes, sir!

273
00:17:17,654 --> 00:17:18,654
Mr. Mouri!

274
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:29,554
Mr. Mouri!

275
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:33,453
Save Mr. Mouri!

276
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:35,953
-Hurry! Hurry! -Yes, sir...

277
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,453
Officer Takagi, go get the boats.

278
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:39,953
-Hurry! We've got to save him no matter what. -I'll go ask for support.

279
00:17:39,954 --> 00:17:42,054
Will both of you come with me?

280
00:17:43,254 --> 00:17:44,553
Inspector!

281
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:46,253
Conan.

282
00:17:46,254 --> 00:17:47,554
Where's Pops?

283
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:53,953
Inspector Megure.

284
00:17:53,954 --> 00:17:57,654
We found this in the water.

285
00:17:59,054 --> 00:18:00,153
And?

286
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:02,854
We could not locate Mr. Mouri though.

287
00:18:06,254 --> 00:18:08,454
The man from Bar Lemon.

288
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:13,853
Yes. I suddenly got a call from Mrs. Kimura,

289
00:18:13,854 --> 00:18:15,553
and couldn't make out the address she gave me.

290
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:20,753
I thought I had to relay the message to Mr. Mouri as soon as possible.

291
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:22,854
I had no idea that things would turn out like this.

292
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:29,653
It sure gets cold when the sun goes down, Mr. Kimura.

293
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:32,153
Mr. Mouri! You're okay!

294
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:35,253
Huh? I picked this up.

295
00:18:35,254 --> 00:18:39,153
I get it. You put a dummy on board the boat and...

296
00:18:39,154 --> 00:18:42,353
Yes, yes. You tried to lure the sniper out.

297
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,053
I'm so glad. You are indeed Kogoro Mouri.

298
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:47,353
Inspector, what about Mr. Kimura?

299
00:18:47,354 --> 00:18:48,754
Did you find him?

300
00:18:51,454 --> 00:18:55,253
Inspector, you don't have to worry about him.

301
00:18:55,254 --> 00:18:56,853
What do you mean?

302
00:18:56,854 --> 00:19:01,253
There is no such person by the name of Kimura to begin with.

303
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:04,153
In other words, the culprit is targeting me.

304
00:19:04,154 --> 00:19:08,153
In order to camouflage his motive towards me,

305
00:19:08,154 --> 00:19:11,153
the sniper made up a character by the name of Kimura.

306
00:19:11,154 --> 00:19:13,253
Made up? A motive?

307
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:16,953
Yes. If I were to be killed,

308
00:19:16,954 --> 00:19:19,653
the police will thoroughly investigate my surroundings

309
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:23,253
and will be able to trace the sniper from there.

310
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:27,153
But if I were to be killed because I was mistaken for a man named Kimura,

311
00:19:27,154 --> 00:19:29,353
it will make investigation difficult.

312
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:33,853
Because there will be nothing connecting me to this man.

313
00:19:33,854 --> 00:19:36,653
Which means that the accident at the construction site,

314
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:38,353
the hit-and-run after that

315
00:19:38,354 --> 00:19:40,453
and the warning mail of murder to be carried out

316
00:19:40,454 --> 00:19:44,153
were all camouflage that the sniper schemed?

317
00:19:44,154 --> 00:19:46,153
Do you have evidence that he doesn't exist?

318
00:19:46,154 --> 00:19:47,453
Then who is the sniper?

319
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:50,153
Now, hold your horses.

320
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:51,253
Mr. Inoue.

321
00:19:51,254 --> 00:19:54,553
You have a briefcase in your car, don't you?

322
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:56,553
Could we have a look at it?

323
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:57,554
Yes, go ahead.

324
00:19:57,555 --> 00:19:59,653
I'll go get it.

325
00:19:59,654 --> 00:20:00,953
It's in the trunk.

326
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:02,553
By the way, Mr. Inoue.

327
00:20:02,554 --> 00:20:06,153
You gave me the service coupon in Bar Lemon

328
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:08,953
just to provide services for me.

329
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:12,453
You waited for an opportunity.

330
00:20:12,454 --> 00:20:14,753
When I fell asleep after getting drunk,

331
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:18,753
you exchanged the jacket and cell phone that you had prepared with mine.

332
00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:20,953
No. Mr. Kimura really came and...

333
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:22,453
He went home after he had a drink?

334
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:25,153
But he only drank water.

335
00:20:25,154 --> 00:20:28,453
The contents of Mr. Kimura's bottle was water.

336
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:30,054
Inspector, I found it.

337
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:34,153
This is...

338
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:36,453
The rifle that fired at me.

339
00:20:36,454 --> 00:20:39,353
Do you have proof that I fired it?

340
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:40,653
In that dummy over there,

341
00:20:40,654 --> 00:20:43,453
you can find the bullet of a rifle in its left chest.

342
00:20:43,454 --> 00:20:46,253
If you match the bullet and the traces that the bullet left behind,

343
00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:49,053
and if the rifle mark matches,

344
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:51,053
it will serve as immovable evidence.

345
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:54,453
But I have no motive to go after Mr. Mouri's life.

346
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,953
You do. You have a grudge against me.

347
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:58,653
Please look through the file.

348
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:00,953
-Conan. -Yes, sir.

349
00:21:00,954 --> 00:21:01,954
Here you are.

350
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:03,853
What's this?

351
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:07,353
The grudge that you have against me for arresting you.

352
00:21:07,354 --> 00:21:09,553
That picture is of you, back then.

353
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:11,553
After serving time, you got yourself plastic surgery.

354
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:13,553
Well, I don't know how you did it

355
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:16,353
but you also changed your family register and became a different person.

356
00:21:16,354 --> 00:21:18,353
Mr. Hiroshi Ukita.

357
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:20,153
This is your real name.

358
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,553
If you insist that I'm wrong,

359
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:23,953
let's have you remove the manicure you have on your fingers

360
00:21:23,954 --> 00:21:27,254
with nail polish remover and try matching your fingerprints.

361
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:36,053
I finally got myself a girlfriend and needed money to get married to her.

362
00:21:36,054 --> 00:21:39,953
That was the last job I did, but I got nabbed by you.

363
00:21:39,954 --> 00:21:41,953
She left me.

364
00:21:41,954 --> 00:21:43,253
I swore that once I got out,

365
00:21:43,254 --> 00:21:45,453
I would get back at you for messing up my life.

366
00:21:45,454 --> 00:21:47,153
Cut out your stupid talk!

367
00:21:47,154 --> 00:21:50,953
You could never become happy with money that you had to commit a crime for!

368
00:21:50,954 --> 00:21:53,753
Don't you think that you're a fool for trying to get back at Mr. Mouri

369
00:21:53,754 --> 00:21:57,654
for your own wrongdoing, committing an additional crime?

370
00:23:24,854 --> 00:23:27,453
You never know when someone like me, being such a famous detective,

371
00:23:27,454 --> 00:23:30,453
could become a target of some sniper.

372
00:23:30,454 --> 00:23:31,753
I tell you, he's hopeless.

373
00:23:31,754 --> 00:23:35,553
The one in the class next to ours, the boy called Kitada.

374
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:37,653
A thief! Conan, hold my bag for me, will you?

375
00:23:37,654 --> 00:23:38,954
That person is...

376
00:23:44,654 --> 00:23:45,754
Dad?

377
00:23:47,354 --> 00:23:49,453
What're you doing dressed like that?

378
00:23:49,454 --> 00:23:52,753
If you see any suspicious looking guy, let me know right away.

379
00:23:52,754 --> 00:23:55,854
You're the one who looks most suspicious.

380
00:23:57,154 --> 00:23:58,453
"Next Episode."

381
00:23:58,454 --> 00:24:01,453
The client is a family of musicians.

382
00:24:01,454 --> 00:24:05,753
There's a perfect-pitch composer among them.

383
00:24:05,754 --> 00:24:08,453
Perfect pitch?

384
00:24:08,454 --> 00:24:10,154
A Stradivarius?

385
00:24:12,754 --> 00:24:15,653
Pops! Park the car under that window.

386
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:16,654
Hurry!

387
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:19,854
Wait. That's absurd.

388
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:27,154
Next Conan, "Cacophony of Stradivarius! Prelude!"

389
00:24:42,954 --> 00:24:44,953
Next Conan's Hint:

390
00:24:44,954 --> 00:24:47,353
"Requiem."

391
00:24:47,354 --> 00:24:48,653
The Detective Conan Series enters its 10th year.

392
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,153
I have a feeling something's going to happen this year.

393
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:52,154
-Root for us, okay? -Root for us, okay?
