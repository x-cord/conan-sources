1
00:00:13,777 --> 00:00:15,777
Good morning.

2
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:20,477
Good morning.

3
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:23,877
How come you look so untidy?

4
00:00:23,877 --> 00:00:25,577
"Smoking Room"

5
00:00:25,577 --> 00:00:27,077
If you're a police detective,

6
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:28,577
you should dress and groom yourself like one.

7
00:00:28,577 --> 00:00:30,477
I can't help it, can I?

8
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:33,477
I was staking out all night till just a while ago.

9
00:00:35,277 --> 00:00:36,477
Geez.

10
00:00:36,477 --> 00:00:38,977
The least you can do is fix your necktie right.

11
00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:42,477
It's okay because I finished reporting

12
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:44,777
and all I have to do today is go home and sleep already.

13
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:47,277
Hey, stop moving.

14
00:00:47,277 --> 00:00:48,477
Okay.

15
00:00:57,877 --> 00:00:59,377
It... it's okay already.

16
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:01,277
I'll do the rest myself.

17
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:03,277
Thank you so much.

18
00:01:03,277 --> 00:01:05,577
I'll go on home then.

19
00:01:05,577 --> 00:01:07,077
Gosh.

20
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:09,177
Wait up, Officer Takagi.

21
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:10,677
Wait for me.

22
00:01:14,077 --> 00:01:18,077
-No... -Officer Takagi sure is outright open nowadays.

23
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,877
It seems the number of times they have meals together

24
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:22,077
is also increasing day by day.

25
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:23,577
I've also heard unverified information

26
00:01:23,577 --> 00:01:25,477
that they've kissed too.

27
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:26,577
-What? -What?

28
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:28,877
Without even consulting me?

29
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:29,877
Well...

30
00:01:29,877 --> 00:01:32,077
It's like I said merely unverified information.

31
00:01:32,077 --> 00:01:34,577
Then, go confirm it right away.

32
00:01:34,577 --> 00:01:36,077
-You're a detective, aren't you? -Hey.

33
00:01:36,077 --> 00:01:38,677
-How about it, Shiratori? -What?

34
00:01:38,677 --> 00:01:41,177
What's going on between Takagi and Sato.

35
00:01:41,177 --> 00:01:45,777
You're in charge of completely guarding Miwako Sato, aren't you?

36
00:01:46,777 --> 00:01:48,177
If it's those two,

37
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:50,477
I think it's turning out the way it should.

38
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,077
It seems they both have feelings for each other too.

39
00:01:53,077 --> 00:01:57,577
Besides, I gave away being in charge to somebody else.

40
00:01:57,577 --> 00:01:59,077
So, if you will excuse me...

41
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,977
Hey, Shiratori!

42
00:02:00,977 --> 00:02:03,177
What's come over him?

43
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:04,777
According to some tips I got,

44
00:02:04,777 --> 00:02:07,177
it seems Mr. Shiratori has another girlfriend.

45
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:08,377
-What? -What?

46
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:11,477
Something about she being a split double of Ms. Sato.

47
00:02:11,477 --> 00:02:13,577
Who and where the hell is she?

48
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:35,977
Brooding over passing seasons

49
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:37,977
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

50
00:02:37,977 --> 00:02:39,977
Ms. Kobayashi encounters a case.

51
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:42,077
Inspector Shiratori is her bodyguard?

52
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:43,677
He sees through the one and only truth.

53
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:45,577
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

54
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:47,577
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

55
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:16,502
"Ms. Kobayashi's Love Affair"

56
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:20,202
Yes. I got it.

57
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:23,002
You don't want me walking around alone at night, right?

58
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:24,802
No. If possible,

59
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:28,302
I'd like you not to go out after 9 pm.

60
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:33,502
Because there are a lot of muggings in the area that you live now.

61
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:35,602
I saw it on the news this morning.

62
00:04:35,602 --> 00:04:37,802
The culprit seems to be a woman.

63
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:38,802
Yes.

64
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:41,002
But...

65
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:42,602
Why?

66
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:45,702
Why do you give me a call all the time?

67
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,002
Because I'm worried.

68
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:50,602
Does it bother you?

69
00:04:50,602 --> 00:04:52,602
No. It's the other way around,

70
00:04:52,602 --> 00:04:54,002
you're helping me a lot.

71
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,002
I'm glad.

72
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:59,102
Please be very careful then.

73
00:04:59,102 --> 00:05:02,202
Yes. Thank you so much for going out of your way to call me.

74
00:05:06,402 --> 00:05:08,302
Teacher.

75
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:11,302
I've been trying to tell you from a while ago

76
00:05:11,302 --> 00:05:13,202
that we finished cleaning the rabbit cage already.

77
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:16,702
You children were monitors for cleaning the rabbit cage

78
00:05:16,702 --> 00:05:19,002
during summer vacation.

79
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:20,302
Good work.

80
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:23,502
Was the call just now from Inspector Shiratori?

81
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:28,302
Yes, but how did you know?

82
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:30,502
It's easy to tell.

83
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:33,502
Your face is red, teacher.

84
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:36,702
No... no way. I'm not blushed.

85
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:37,702
And?

86
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:42,202
Did he tell you already that he likes you?

87
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:46,202
What? Why?

88
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:47,902
I guess not.

89
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:50,602
Doesn't Inspector Shiratori look familiar?

90
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:51,702
Familiar?

91
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:55,402
Like, have you seen him when you were a child?

92
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:57,202
Come to think of it...

93
00:05:57,202 --> 00:05:58,602
When I first saw him,

94
00:05:58,602 --> 00:06:02,202
it felt like it wasn't the first time.

95
00:06:02,202 --> 00:06:04,002
It was like a strange drawer

96
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:06,702
that was deep inside my heart opened.

97
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:09,602
Then, the clue is bookstore.

98
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:10,702
Bookstore?

99
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:13,902
Inspector Shiratori told us to not say anything

100
00:06:13,902 --> 00:06:15,502
about the incident at the bookstore

101
00:06:15,502 --> 00:06:17,802
when he saved Ms. Kobayashi from some shoplifters

102
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:21,902
because he wants to tell her himself, didn't he?

103
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:23,402
Right.

104
00:06:23,402 --> 00:06:25,802
Well, I'm sure he's waiting for the right timing to tell her,

105
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,802
so that he can touch her heart.

106
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:31,002
How frustrating, don't you think?

107
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:32,902
Don't tell me that...

108
00:06:32,902 --> 00:06:34,002
The book titled

109
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:36,702
"The 30 Mistakes of the Mystery Man with 30 Faces"

110
00:06:36,702 --> 00:06:38,502
is going on the market today, isn't it?

111
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:39,902
Yes.

112
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:40,902
Good.

113
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:43,902
I forgot to reserve it so I've got to go buy it today.

114
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:46,502
Then, you'd better go get it quickly.

115
00:06:46,502 --> 00:06:48,602
The bookstore that you always go to

116
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:52,302
is going to be closing early today because of fireworks.

117
00:06:52,302 --> 00:06:55,102
Really? Then, I'd better hurry.

118
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:58,402
Oh, right. Talking of fireworks, are you all going too?

119
00:06:58,402 --> 00:06:59,402
Yes.

120
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:02,902
We're going to gather at 6 pm at Conan's place and go.

121
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:05,302
How unusual.

122
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:07,702
I thought you always got together at Dr. Agasa's place

123
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:09,402
and then go together?

124
00:07:09,402 --> 00:07:13,802
Doctor has to help his friend move, so he can't go.

125
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:16,202
Then, is Detective Mouri going as chaperon?

126
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,602
Pops said that he's going to watch fireworks

127
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:20,102
with his neighbors and drink.

128
00:07:20,102 --> 00:07:22,602
Ran is at summer training with her Karate Club.

129
00:07:22,602 --> 00:07:25,702
We're going by ourselves. Does it bother you?

130
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:28,002
Of course, it bothers me.

131
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,902
"Mouri Detective Agency" -She's late!

132
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:36,902
We'd better hurry or it'll start.

133
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:39,502
Well, I'm sure she'll come soon.

134
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:43,302
Teacher! Ms. Kobayashi!

135
00:07:43,302 --> 00:07:45,602
Hurry, hurry!

136
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:47,402
You're late.

137
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:48,702
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,802
I had trouble buying the book.

139
00:07:55,402 --> 00:07:57,902
The first one already went up.

140
00:07:57,902 --> 00:07:59,902
Really, if we went by ourselves,

141
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:01,302
we would've made it in time.

142
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:04,702
No way. Children shouldn't walk around at night.

143
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:07,702
There's a mugger attacking people in this area recently,

144
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:09,702
so you've got to be careful.

145
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:13,702
And, did Inspector Shiratori tell you that?

146
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,402
Yes.

147
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:18,502
Inspector Shiratori is head over heels over her.

148
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:22,002
Well, I guess he couldn't leave me alone

149
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,502
because I'm not that reliable.

150
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:26,302
But...

151
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:30,202
Not being able to leave you alone is the same as, "like."

152
00:08:31,202 --> 00:08:33,102
Really?

153
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:34,402
You think so?

154
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:36,802
Yes. I'm positive.

155
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:42,302
But...

156
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:46,302
Even so, I wonder how he would do as a boyfriend?

157
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:48,202
After all, he's a police detective,

158
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:49,702
so if he's going after a dangerous culprit,

159
00:08:49,702 --> 00:08:52,302
I'd have to worry.

160
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:56,602
But being able to listen to stories of different cases, may be fun.

161
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,402
Because like you know, I just love mysteries.

162
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:00,402
Right?

163
00:09:03,402 --> 00:09:05,102
Where'd they all go?

164
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:08,502
"Cotton Candy"

165
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:12,402
"Fried Noodles"

166
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:15,502
There are so many open air stalls.

167
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:17,302
I want to eat cotton candy.

168
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:19,702
They have fish scooping too.

169
00:09:19,702 --> 00:09:22,202
Ms. Kobayashi's not around, is she?

170
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:25,402
I did tell her that we were going to take the short cut.

171
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,302
Hey.

172
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:33,002
Where are all of you?

173
00:09:34,302 --> 00:09:36,202
Conan?

174
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:39,502
They could never be in a place like this.

175
00:09:39,502 --> 00:09:42,002
Where could they be?

176
00:09:42,002 --> 00:09:43,202
Right.

177
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:46,002
I guess I'll mail Inspector Shiratori.

178
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,702
"Inspector. There's trouble."

179
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:51,202
"5 children disappeared in a puff of smoke."

180
00:09:51,202 --> 00:09:54,102
-Pretty good. -Never mind, just give me that!

181
00:09:54,102 --> 00:09:55,302
I'm going to kill you.

182
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:02,002
Somebody's having an argument with somebody.

183
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,502
Don't tell me that...

184
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:05,702
it's the mugger?

185
00:10:07,202 --> 00:10:09,002
I'm calling the inspector.

186
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:12,502
But, if I'm wrong, I'd be troubling him.

187
00:10:12,502 --> 00:10:15,502
Only if Conan and the others were here...

188
00:10:17,302 --> 00:10:18,902
Right.

189
00:10:18,902 --> 00:10:22,202
It could be that they've gotten mixed up in it too.

190
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:25,102
I've got to confirm either way.

191
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:41,802
What?

192
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:46,602
What's with that person?

193
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:52,202
No.

194
00:10:58,102 --> 00:11:00,402
Ms. Kobayashi sure is late.

195
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:01,502
Geez.

196
00:11:02,702 --> 00:11:04,802
Hey, you guys.

197
00:11:04,802 --> 00:11:07,102
I'm going to go get Ms. Kobayashi

198
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:08,302
so stay around here, okay?

199
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:10,102
-Okay. -Okay...

200
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:13,502
Hey.

201
00:11:13,502 --> 00:11:14,602
Hello.

202
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:18,802
Are you all right?

203
00:11:31,302 --> 00:11:32,302
Ms. Kobayashi?

204
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:35,702
Oh, no.

205
00:11:35,702 --> 00:11:36,902
Why...

206
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:45,602
Ms. Kobayashi?

207
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:46,702
Don't come.

208
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:48,602
If you come now, that person will attack...

209
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:51,602
He's gone.

210
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:52,702
Ms. Kobayashi.

211
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:57,102
There was somebody there till a while ago, right?

212
00:11:58,102 --> 00:12:01,602
The person who killed this man.

213
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:09,808
Come on, Ms. Kobayashi.

214
00:12:09,808 --> 00:12:11,908
Don't tense up like that.

215
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:15,608
But... this is the first time I ever came here.

216
00:12:15,608 --> 00:12:20,408
You were called to come here because you witnessed a murder.

217
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:23,808
It's not that you're going to be interrogated for committing a crime

218
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:25,608
so I don't see why you're not more relaxed.

219
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:26,908
I guess so.

220
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:28,608
I've come here so many times,

221
00:12:28,608 --> 00:12:33,908
that I've eaten everything on the restaurant menu they have here.

222
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:35,908
That's eating too much.

223
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:37,908
Miwako.

224
00:12:37,908 --> 00:12:39,108
Hi.

225
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:41,308
Have you come here for interrogation with the brats?

226
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:45,108
What's with that outfit of yours?

227
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:47,408
You're even wearing glasses and all.

228
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:49,308
Are you changing your image?

229
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:51,008
No.

230
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:52,108
"No."

231
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:54,208
Hey, are you asleep yet or what?

232
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,108
Shape up.

233
00:12:58,408 --> 00:13:00,808
Did you just say, "kyah?"

234
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:02,808
Just what do you think you're doing?

235
00:13:02,808 --> 00:13:04,508
What am I doing?

236
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:06,508
Miwako, are you sure you don't have a fever or something.

237
00:13:06,508 --> 00:13:08,508
No, Yumi.

238
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:10,008
She is...

239
00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:11,008
Ms. Sato.

240
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:14,208
The children have come.

241
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:18,908
Wasn't the school teacher supposed to come too?

242
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:21,008
So, like I said, she is...

243
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:25,008
The homeroom teacher of Teitan Elementary, First grade, Class B,

244
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:28,608
and also an important witness to the murder that occurred,

245
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,808
Ms. Sumiko Kobayashi.

246
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:32,708
Please don't mistake her for someone else.

247
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:38,508
Okay, please give us the details in that room over there.

248
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:39,508
Yes.

249
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:45,708
You've got be kidding.

250
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:50,008
Excuse me, is there somebody that looks like me?

251
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:53,708
Yes. Although I don't think that you look that much alike.

252
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,308
Well... I think, maybe a little bit?

253
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:02,808
Are we by chance going to the interrogation room?

254
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,708
No, just to a plain conference room.

255
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,908
I see.

256
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:08,708
You look a bit disappointed.

257
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:09,808
Oh, no...

258
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,508
I was just a bit interested.

259
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:17,808
Is the girl that Shiratori is head over heels with?

260
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:20,808
I've kept hearing that they resembled each other but...

261
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:23,208
I didn't think that she looked that much like Ms. Sato.

262
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,008
I was surprised too

263
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:27,608
when I first met her.

264
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:28,908
Right, right.

265
00:14:28,908 --> 00:14:30,508
Yes. But, well...

266
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:32,308
the way she talks and her character too

267
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:35,008
are completely opposite so... Ouch.

268
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:38,108
Who's the complete opposite of me?

269
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:39,108
Oh, no...

270
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:40,308
Well, well,

271
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:43,608
he's just saying that you're more police detective like and manly.

272
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:45,408
What? What's that supposed to mean?

273
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:48,908
Well, never mind.

274
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:51,408
The three suspects for the murder case were brought here,

275
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:53,308
so let's start interrogation.

276
00:14:53,308 --> 00:14:54,308
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:14:57,608 --> 00:14:58,708
As for those two,

278
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,608
since Mr. Shiratori, who was their setback pulling out of the picture,

279
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:04,208
they're headed straight toward reaching their goal.

280
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,608
Well, as for me,

281
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:10,608
it's a bit boring that I don't get to get Shiratori all worked up

282
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:12,508
and tease him anymore.

283
00:15:13,808 --> 00:15:15,008
"Conference Room"

284
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:16,608
I see.

285
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:18,708
So, if I organize what you just told me,

286
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,508
you were with the children on your way to watch fireworks

287
00:15:21,508 --> 00:15:22,908
and lost them partway.

288
00:15:22,908 --> 00:15:24,708
So you were looking for them.

289
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:29,008
Then you heard two people arguing with each other.

290
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:33,008
And then you went into the back alley to check things out

291
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:36,108
and saw the killer run off.

292
00:15:36,108 --> 00:15:41,508
In addition, when you screamed at finding the body of the victim,

293
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:45,308
Conan came running to the scene?

294
00:15:45,308 --> 00:15:46,908
Yes, sir.

295
00:15:46,908 --> 00:15:49,508
I'd like to just confirm with you once again,

296
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:52,208
but the corpse that you found was...

297
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:56,008
Mr. Akira Sumida, is that correct?

298
00:15:58,008 --> 00:16:00,808
Yes. I think so.

299
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:01,908
And do you remember

300
00:16:01,908 --> 00:16:07,808
what Mr. Sumida was arguing about with the killer?

301
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:10,708
Well... I could hear them,

302
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,508
but their conversation was erased by the sound of the fireworks,

303
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:13,708
so I can't say...

304
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,208
But, I remember clearly that the killer woman

305
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,008
was shouting at the top of her lungs

306
00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:21,508
because she did so when no fireworks were shot up.

307
00:16:21,508 --> 00:16:25,508
She said, "Never mind, just give me that. I'll kill you."

308
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:26,708
I see.

309
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:30,508
That's why I thought that she was the mugger

310
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:32,708
that frequently appeared in the area.

311
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:36,908
No, we arrested the mugger at sunset the same day.

312
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:40,408
But, what makes you think that the killer is a woman?

313
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:42,608
Is it because you heard her shout?

314
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:45,808
The silhouette of the killer that ran off.

315
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:48,208
She had quite a breast.

316
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,208
Besides, I think she had her long hair tied in the back

317
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,908
and was wearing a cap.

318
00:16:53,908 --> 00:16:55,508
I'm pretty sure.

319
00:16:55,508 --> 00:16:58,708
You didn't get to see the killer's face?

320
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,808
No, sir. Because it was dark.

321
00:17:00,808 --> 00:17:06,408
But, the killer may have remembered your face, right?

322
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:08,008
Why do you think so?

323
00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:10,908
Because I'm not the only one who went running over

324
00:17:10,908 --> 00:17:12,808
after hearing Ms. Kobayashi screamed.

325
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:15,008
What did you say?

326
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:16,308
Then, don't tell me that...

327
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:18,008
Isn't that right, Ms. Kobayashi?

328
00:17:18,008 --> 00:17:22,508
Yes. The killer seems to have been watching me

329
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,508
from some distance away.

330
00:17:24,508 --> 00:17:27,708
The killer disappeared when Conan came, though.

331
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,308
That's dangerous.

332
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:30,508
There's no guarantee that the killer won't come back

333
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,308
and attack you to shut you up.

334
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:33,308
What?

335
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:35,308
No need to worry.

336
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:36,908
We the members of the Youth Detective Squad

337
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:38,608
will spend the night at Ms. Kobayashi's place.

338
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:41,708
We won't let the killer lay a finger on you.

339
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,108
All of you.

340
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:46,608
No. No need for that.

341
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:53,208
Because I, Ninzaburo Shiratori will protect you

342
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,808
over my dead body.

343
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:56,808
Thank you.

344
00:18:02,908 --> 00:18:05,508
I don't mean to bring you down

345
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:08,508
but don't you have to ask us any questions,

346
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:11,008
although we got to the scene right after Conan did?

347
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:14,308
Yes. Okay, well let me ask you

348
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:18,008
if you didn't see any figure run off.

349
00:18:18,008 --> 00:18:19,708
We didn't.

350
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,808
You sound like you're just asking out of routine.

351
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:26,508
Oh, no. Didn't Mr. Agasa witness anything?

352
00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:27,608
He was with you, wasn't he?

353
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,808
Dr. Agasa couldn't come

354
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,708
because he had to help his friend move.

355
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,108
Move?

356
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:36,408
Come to think of it, before the two started arguing,

357
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,408
I saw what looked to be the truck of movers,

358
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,708
go off from near the alley.

359
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,608
What? Really?

360
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:45,008
Yes. I couldn't tell the model of the car

361
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:47,508
because it was blocked off by the wall.

362
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:50,808
But, there was a large number 09 written on the truck.

363
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:53,708
How do you know they are movers

364
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,608
if numbers are written on the truck?

365
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:59,108
The only cars with company telephone numbers printed on them

366
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:01,508
are those of the movers or couriers.

367
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:06,008
If that truck was parked there for a while,

368
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:09,908
someone may have seen the two arguing.

369
00:19:09,908 --> 00:19:11,608
Let's have that checked out right away.

370
00:19:13,508 --> 00:19:17,508
Then could we sort on home already?

371
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:20,608
Yes, you children may leave.

372
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:24,608
But, Ms. Kobayashi, will you bear with me a while longer?

373
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:25,708
Just now

374
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,808
we have three suspects that have been brought here

375
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:31,608
who have grudges against the victim and lack of alibi.

376
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:33,908
And, if you remember the killer's voice,

377
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:35,908
I'd like you to confirm it.

378
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,008
Yes, sir.

379
00:19:38,008 --> 00:19:41,808
But, before that...

380
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:45,208
What is it?

381
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,208
If it's the restroom, would you like me to go with you?

382
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,708
I know where it is.

383
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,508
Really?

384
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:54,908
I'm going along too then.

385
00:19:58,308 --> 00:20:01,008
Okay, I'll be right back then.

386
00:20:01,008 --> 00:20:02,408
Take your time.

387
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:13,208
Telling a lady to take her time in the restroom is rude.

388
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:16,508
It's as if you're saying that teacher's going to...

389
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:20,508
No way. I didn't mean to insinuate anything.

390
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:27,008
And, what did this woman victim used to do?

391
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:30,708
She owned a pawn shop.

392
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,108
Hey, please wait a minute.

393
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,308
She's a woman?

394
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:35,308
Yes.

395
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:38,108
This shirt is worn right side in front,

396
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:39,508
so it's ladies' wear.

397
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:43,508
The name Akira can be used for a woman or a man too.

398
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,108
I see.

399
00:20:45,108 --> 00:20:48,408
Well, it seems that she used to get angry frequently

400
00:20:48,408 --> 00:20:50,608
because people mistook her for being a man.

401
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:53,808
On the other hand, there seems to have been a lot of people

402
00:20:53,808 --> 00:20:55,708
who were angry at her evil ways of doing business.

403
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,108
Sorry to keep you waiting.

404
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:02,408
The children aren't back yet?

405
00:21:06,508 --> 00:21:08,308
The restrooms in the police station

406
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,508
are like any other restrooms.

407
00:21:10,508 --> 00:21:12,208
Most naturally.

408
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:21,708
What am I talking about?

409
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,408
Why shouldn't I meet her?

410
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:24,508
Well...

411
00:21:24,508 --> 00:21:26,308
That's because there are many things involved.

412
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:28,608
A lot of things involved, is not an answer, is it?

413
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:30,608
But...

414
00:21:30,608 --> 00:21:31,708
She really is here.

415
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,508
The one who looks just like me.

416
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:35,308
If I remember correctly, her name is...

417
00:21:35,308 --> 00:21:38,008
Ms. Miwako Sato.

418
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:39,508
How envious...

419
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:43,208
I wanted to be a woman detective too.

420
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:47,508
Really, that Takagi is making lovey dovey again

421
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:50,108
with our Ms. Miwako.

422
00:21:53,408 --> 00:21:55,208
I think he's getting carried away

423
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,408
because Shiratori backed off.

424
00:21:57,408 --> 00:21:58,508
Yes.

425
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:04,808
After all, he was the top in charge of protecting Miwako Sato.

426
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:08,308
Shiratori, really made out, didn't he?

427
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:12,108
Yes. I didn't think she would look that much like Sato.

428
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:15,008
I wonder if there's another one somewhere?

429
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:17,308
That teacher's the last.

430
00:22:17,308 --> 00:22:18,708
Yes, right?

431
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,208
Ms. Kobayashi. Thank you for waiting.

432
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,408
What's the matter, Ms. Kobayashi?

433
00:22:26,608 --> 00:22:27,708
Ms. Kobayashi?

434
00:23:54,508 --> 00:23:56,308
The suspect is...

435
00:23:56,308 --> 00:23:58,208
a woman who used to be the leader of a motorbike gang.

436
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,908
The woman owner of a Japanese cuisine shop.

437
00:23:59,908 --> 00:24:02,208
And a former hero of high school baseball.

438
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:05,708
It seems that she doesn't like me anymore.

439
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:09,808
That maybe she was just a substitute for Officer Sato.

440
00:24:09,808 --> 00:24:12,408
Are you accusing me of lying?

441
00:24:12,408 --> 00:24:14,608
I'm lying.

442
00:24:14,608 --> 00:24:18,408
I really came to see you.

443
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:20,008
Next Conan,

444
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:26,808
"Inspector Shiratori's Heartbreak"
