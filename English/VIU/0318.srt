1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,769
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,669
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,469
Queer actions after committing the crime.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,869
An accident or a case of homicide. What is the hidden truth?

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,269
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,469
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,870
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:02,673
Oh no... not again.

9
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:04,673
Why is it that all the cars you rent

10
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:06,973
always break down, dad?

11
00:02:06,974 --> 00:02:10,073
We can't even use the cell phone in the mountains like this.

12
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:13,573
We've got no choice but to wait for the fog to clear.

13
00:02:13,574 --> 00:02:17,973
Hey, don't smoke in a small place like this!

14
00:02:17,974 --> 00:02:21,774
Shut up! I'll open the window, okay?

15
00:02:23,474 --> 00:02:26,673
Gosh, now what...

16
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:29,073
It's nothing.

17
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:32,773
Ran, I'll bet you're scared.

18
00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:34,573
That there's a mountain monster

19
00:02:34,574 --> 00:02:36,473
looking at us from somewhere.

20
00:02:36,474 --> 00:02:40,973
I can't hear you, I can't hear a thing!

21
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:43,273
Just as I though...

22
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:45,874
Gosh, hopeless...

23
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:49,573
Oh, it's a car.

24
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:52,273
Saved...

25
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:53,774
It turned the corner.

26
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,873
Wait a second.

27
00:02:56,874 --> 00:02:59,774
Was there are side road there?

28
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:04,573
Pops, which means the car we just saw...

29
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:05,773
Yeah.

30
00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:08,174
It could've been an apparition.

31
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:19,274
"The Lucky Cigar Case (Part 1)"

32
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:22,373
Hey, hey, let's not...

33
00:03:22,374 --> 00:03:24,373
Don't worry.

34
00:03:24,374 --> 00:03:25,973
You saw the sign, didn't you?

35
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:29,773
It's a study facility for a legitimate company.

36
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:30,774
The people of the company

37
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:32,773
would never be in a place like this at this time!

38
00:03:32,774 --> 00:03:35,673
I'm sure the car we just saw is a robber's car or something.

39
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:36,973
What the...

40
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:39,073
I'll go first and check things out!

41
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:40,774
Be careful!

42
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:45,274
Oh, it's a car.

43
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:51,473
It still warm.

44
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:53,773
It's a cute car.

45
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:54,973
What a relief!

46
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:57,473
Bad people don't ride cars like this, do they?

47
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:00,874
There seems to be a lot of other cars. See.

48
00:04:03,274 --> 00:04:05,473
This one is warmer!

49
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:08,974
The car that came in here just a while ago is probably this car!

50
00:04:11,174 --> 00:04:14,873
This car is still warm too.

51
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:16,273
Which means...

52
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:19,573
There are people here for sure!

53
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:20,974
-Let's go! -Okay!

54
00:04:27,074 --> 00:04:30,373
Kuron Health Equipment Corporation.

55
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:32,274
I've never heard of them.

56
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,273
You two, mind your manners.

57
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:37,474
Yes, sir!

58
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:40,973
Hello!

59
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:43,474
Is anyone in?

60
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:49,074
They couldn't be sleeping at this hour yet, could they...

61
00:04:53,274 --> 00:04:54,274
What it is?

62
00:04:54,974 --> 00:04:57,073
I'm sorry to be intruding on you at this hour,

63
00:04:57,074 --> 00:05:00,174
but our car broke down nearby.

64
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:05,673
So, you see, we're stalled in this fog,

65
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:08,473
so we would like to ask you for some help.

66
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,173
Please go find someone else to help you,

67
00:05:10,174 --> 00:05:12,273
because I'm going to get busy from now.

68
00:05:12,274 --> 00:05:14,873
Wait!

69
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:17,874
Please at least lend us your phone! Please!

70
00:05:20,774 --> 00:05:22,173
Please wait!

71
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:23,373
Wait.

72
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:25,473
Hey!

73
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:27,673
What a guy.

74
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:30,473
I promise that if I die, I'll come and haunt you!

75
00:05:30,474 --> 00:05:32,573
Darn.

76
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:34,873
I guess we'll just have to go back to the car.

77
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:36,674
It's cold.

78
00:05:38,174 --> 00:05:40,073
You seem to be in trouble.

79
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:41,473
Please do come in.

80
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,373
Wow, is it okay?

81
00:05:43,374 --> 00:05:45,674
Thank you so very much!

82
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:49,973
What a fix, eh.

83
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,473
This is a study facility for the company

84
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:54,774
that there's usually no one here.

85
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:58,273
The phone's over there.

86
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,873
Thank you.

87
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:02,373
Are you sure it's okay?

88
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:04,673
What if they're spies?

89
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:06,373
Talk about push over,

90
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:08,573
or rather is it that you have a lot of elbow room

91
00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:10,273
because you're in the 1st development section?

92
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:12,173
I heard you all!

93
00:06:12,174 --> 00:06:13,174
Oh, president.

94
00:06:13,175 --> 00:06:15,274
Just what are you guys doing?

95
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:19,073
We're sorry to be intruding on you,

96
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:22,073
but we're not suspicious people.

97
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:27,473
I am a private detective and my name is Kogoro Mouri.

98
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:31,973
Mouri, you mean that famous "Sleeping Mouri"?

99
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,873
Yes, well...

100
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:36,173
this is my daughter Ran,

101
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:39,573
and the little one there is Conan.

102
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:41,273
Oh my,

103
00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:42,973
I am very honored to be able meet you.

104
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:48,273
I am the president of Kuron Health Equipment Corporation, Umetani.

105
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,273
Please make yourselves at home here.

106
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:52,773
Oh, that's right!

107
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:55,573
Mr. Mouri, please become a monitor for us!

108
00:06:55,574 --> 00:06:57,373
How about it?

109
00:06:57,374 --> 00:07:00,673
We having an in-company competition on a relax sheet,

110
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:02,473
and we would appreciate it if you could give us

111
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:04,373
your unbiased opinion how you feel about it.

112
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:06,274
Oh...

113
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:16,674
There, right there.

114
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:21,073
This is just great.

115
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,473
It feels so good!

116
00:07:23,474 --> 00:07:27,374
Dad, you're so embarrassing.

117
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:33,073
I've never experienced a great massage chair like this!

118
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:35,973
It fits right into the vital spot.

119
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:38,573
Yes, the combination of the softness of tanned hide

120
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:41,073
and the combination of artificial leather for durability

121
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:42,973
makes for a sensation of perfect fit.

122
00:07:42,974 --> 00:07:45,373
Just as expected of the 1st development section!

123
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:47,274
Well done, Nakano!

124
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:48,973
But, president.

125
00:07:48,974 --> 00:07:52,373
That artificial leather you take pride in is made in Italy!

126
00:07:52,374 --> 00:07:53,573
Moreover, for the massager part,

127
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,773
high grade silicone rubber is lavishly used!

128
00:07:56,774 --> 00:07:59,973
Therefore, the production cost is too high.

129
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:02,673
What? What is the meaning of this, Nakano?

130
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:04,373
The original parts of the basic components such as the rollers,

131
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:07,373
are of the same product line as what we've used so far,

132
00:08:07,374 --> 00:08:08,973
so as far as that's concerned, the cost is...

133
00:08:08,974 --> 00:08:10,873
You idiot!

134
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:13,473
Never mind durability!

135
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:16,273
But, even if we don't make much profit,

136
00:08:16,274 --> 00:08:18,873
so long as we produce good items to our customers,

137
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,073
eventually...

138
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:22,273
Eventually is not what we're after!

139
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:24,673
Make profit for me right this minute!

140
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:26,573
Rather, what I mean is,

141
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:29,273
if we don't keep dishing out new products,

142
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:32,174
the customers will give up on us.

143
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:35,074
Next!

144
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,373
That president is kind of scary, isn't he?

145
00:08:38,374 --> 00:08:39,473
Yeah.

146
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:43,273
Next for the 2nd development section's Ecstasy One.

147
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:47,473
This product is made for the younger generation.

148
00:08:47,474 --> 00:08:49,073
Please take a look.

149
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:50,673
This seat is a cover-type seat.

150
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:53,073
There are 7 color variations and the color of the customer's choice

151
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,873
can be chosen to meet any type of interior.

152
00:08:55,874 --> 00:08:59,673
The back part of the seat can be reclined to any angle,

153
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:04,073
and it can also be used in the living room as a sofa.

154
00:09:04,074 --> 00:09:05,373
I see,

155
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:08,173
it sure seems to be great for a young person's room!

156
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:10,573
You move this device using the remote controller

157
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:12,673
that is in the side pocket.

158
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:15,474
First, let's start with full body massage...

159
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:21,274
Are you sleepy, Conan?

160
00:09:24,274 --> 00:09:26,973
Stop it already.

161
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:29,173
What on earth is this?

162
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:30,473
It's made for young people

163
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:33,273
so maybe it's too strong for you, Mr. Mouri?

164
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:35,973
I'll switch it to weak sleep mode.

165
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:37,473
No thanks!

166
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:38,873
Relieve my tiredness, my foot!

167
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:41,273
My whole body feels as if it's going to fall apart!

168
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:42,873
But...

169
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,973
Kasahara! That's enough.

170
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:48,373
-Oh, well... -Next! Hiramatsu!

171
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:50,174
Yes.

172
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,573
Hey, hey, what's this?

173
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:57,273
Are you going to beat up some monster?

174
00:09:57,274 --> 00:09:58,274
Come to think of it,

175
00:09:58,275 --> 00:10:01,473
my child has a toy that looks something like this.

176
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:04,673
Really, it looks like some robot animation.

177
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:07,474
Well, take a look at it, please.

178
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:12,673
Oh, yes, right there!

179
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:14,973
Right, just great, right there!

180
00:10:14,974 --> 00:10:16,573
Dad?

181
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,673
How does this thing know just where I want to be massaged?

182
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:21,873
Right! That's exactly what the main feature

183
00:10:21,874 --> 00:10:24,873
of this business type AIMS is all about!

184
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,573
A micro sensor detects the part of your body that is stiff

185
00:10:27,574 --> 00:10:30,873
and massages with the exact strength needed.

186
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:33,073
Sounds like a great function,

187
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:35,673
but I'll bet the cost is really high.

188
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:39,073
No, the only thing new is the program,

189
00:10:39,074 --> 00:10:42,473
and the rest involves diverting what was being used till now,

190
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:47,473
so I think the cost is less than half of what your cost is!

191
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:49,673
Besides, with a function as good as that,

192
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:52,873
it'll probably sell even if the price is a bit high.

193
00:10:52,874 --> 00:10:54,473
Yes.

194
00:10:54,474 --> 00:10:59,473
So! I'll think over which machine I'll sell

195
00:10:59,474 --> 00:11:01,873
while taking a smoke.

196
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:03,373
Mr. Mouri, do make yourself at home too!

197
00:11:03,374 --> 00:11:07,774
Thank you. I don't want to come out just yet.

198
00:11:09,574 --> 00:11:13,473
Well, it feels so good, I feel like falling asleep.

199
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:17,073
Dad, you're interfering everybody with their work!

200
00:11:17,074 --> 00:11:20,873
It's okay, because it seems he's already decided so...

201
00:11:20,874 --> 00:11:22,573
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:22,574 --> 00:11:25,673
Things are moving really fast today, don't you think?

203
00:11:25,674 --> 00:11:27,573
It seems like the rumor about behind the scenes negotiations

204
00:11:27,574 --> 00:11:29,673
was true after all.

205
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:32,473
It's probably because Mr. Mouri played monitor for us.

206
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:34,573
President didn't even have to think about it,

207
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:36,873
but I guess he just wanted to emphasize his importance.

208
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:38,573
I get it!

209
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,573
Maybe the rumor about the development section

210
00:11:41,574 --> 00:11:44,373
going to be downsized is true!

211
00:11:44,374 --> 00:11:46,373
Maybe he's thinking over which development section

212
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:48,574
to shut down now.

213
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:51,973
By the way, Mr. Kasahara, your seat

214
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:55,573
pushes at the vital points even if it isn't moving.

215
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:56,773
It's so lumpy!

216
00:11:56,774 --> 00:11:58,973
What? How dare you...

217
00:11:58,974 --> 00:12:01,773
Please calm down, Mr. Kasahara!

218
00:12:01,774 --> 00:12:04,373
Thank you everyone!

219
00:12:04,374 --> 00:12:06,973
May you all work together in peace.

220
00:12:06,974 --> 00:12:10,873
I hope all of your inventions end up being marketed.

221
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:13,173
It's all your fault!

222
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:15,473
You're to blame for this.

223
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:18,473
Right, you do monitor for him,

224
00:12:18,474 --> 00:12:20,173
representing the young generation, Ran!

225
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:22,273
No, I'd rather not...

226
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,073
Where's Conan?

227
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:27,573
Conan! What are you doing?

228
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:29,674
Don't touch things here!

229
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:33,173
Isn't this a knife? It's dangerous!

230
00:12:33,174 --> 00:12:34,873
But, I wonder if it's for real.

231
00:12:34,874 --> 00:12:36,673
It's real!

232
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:40,373
The president is a famous knife collector.

233
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:42,873
There's a lot of talk about his collection with our clients,

234
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:45,274
so he has a lot decorated at the company too.

235
00:12:48,074 --> 00:12:49,574
Sorry to keep you guys waiting!

236
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:52,073
I've made up my mind!

237
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:57,273
We're going to put AIMS of the 3rd development section on the market!

238
00:12:57,274 --> 00:12:59,673
And, we're going to consolidate the first

239
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:02,174
and second development sections into one section.

240
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:06,473
Will everyone except Hiramatsu leave the room?

241
00:13:06,474 --> 00:13:09,073
-President! -I'll talk to you later!

242
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:11,673
Thank you so much also, Mr. Mouri.

243
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:14,673
Please relax in the reception corner.

244
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:19,474
After we finish work, I'd like to talk with you over drinks.

245
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:22,674
Wow, that'd be just great!

246
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:26,874
Okay, I'll be waiting then.

247
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:32,073
They can't dispatch a repair car until the fog clears up after all.

248
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:34,373
I'll bet you're really relieved

249
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:37,073
because you can drink all you like now!

250
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:39,473
Well, I guess I'll go make some coffee then.

251
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:42,473
Oh, let me help you!

252
00:13:42,474 --> 00:13:44,573
I have to go to the restroom.

253
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,873
The restroom's beyond the room we were in just a while ago.

254
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:50,173
It's the second door to your left.

255
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:51,274
Okay!

256
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:54,173
Please nullify my contract with you!

257
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:57,074
I'm fed up having to work under you!

258
00:13:58,174 --> 00:14:01,273
Do I look like a softy who would say, "Yes, of course",

259
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:04,473
and nullify our contract?

260
00:14:04,474 --> 00:14:05,873
No...

261
00:14:05,874 --> 00:14:09,074
so I have already made appropriate arrangements.

262
00:14:10,174 --> 00:14:13,373
So, that you would by no means refuse to do so.

263
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:15,674
I'm definite that you won't refuse.

264
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:23,683
They're sure taking their time.

265
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:25,783
He's probably being threatened

266
00:14:25,784 --> 00:14:28,683
and signing a ruthless contract or something.

267
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:30,683
Serves him right.

268
00:14:30,684 --> 00:14:32,683
A ruthless contract?

269
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:33,783
Yes.

270
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:36,383
What does it mean to nullify a contract?

271
00:14:36,384 --> 00:14:37,483
Gosh!

272
00:14:37,484 --> 00:14:39,783
Keep out of this, kid!

273
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:44,083
Sonny, did you hear Hiramatsu say so to the president?

274
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:48,983
Don't tell me Hiramatsu's planning to quit the company?

275
00:14:48,984 --> 00:14:52,583
Which means that you're all contract employees?

276
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:56,883
Yes, when the president finds a talented developer,

277
00:14:56,884 --> 00:14:59,383
he forces the developer to sign a long-term contract with him,

278
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:01,983
and makes it difficult for the person to quit easily.

279
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,083
By force? No.

280
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:06,383
It's true.

281
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:08,783
The president's physique is as you saw him.

282
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:11,783
Besides, he carries a "dan" in karate.

283
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:14,883
Even if he doesn't really hit you and stops just before hitting,

284
00:15:14,884 --> 00:15:16,383
a weak hearted person would panic

285
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:18,383
and sign the contract immediately.

286
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,983
Oh, no.

287
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:23,183
Well, Kasahara and I have been here

288
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:24,184
since the previous president was our boss,

289
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:26,383
so we've been spared that karate scare

290
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,983
but all the young staff are being tempered here

291
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:31,583
at this study dormitory.

292
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:34,183
Moreover, he takes advantage of tax exemptions

293
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:37,883
and uses company funds to cover everything

294
00:15:37,884 --> 00:15:42,183
from his hobby of collecting knives to giving gifts to women.

295
00:15:42,184 --> 00:15:46,584
Even on our way here... take a look at this!

296
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:50,183
What's that?

297
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:52,384
Strange, that's the sound of a car...

298
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:58,383
It's Mr. Hiramatsu's car.

299
00:15:58,384 --> 00:15:59,784
I wonder what's going on.

300
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:03,883
The window on the other side!

301
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:05,183
It's open.

302
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:06,584
No way?

303
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:09,084
Conan?

304
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:20,184
-This is? -President.

305
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:23,283
President? President!

306
00:16:23,284 --> 00:16:25,083
Please get a hold of yourself!

307
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,984
Please stay back!

308
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:30,184
Mr. Umetani, are you okay?

309
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:35,183
He's still breathing!

310
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:36,283
President!

311
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:38,483
Ran! Get the ambulance and the police!

312
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:40,583
Yes!

313
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:44,284
Let's leave the rest to Ran and go after Mr. Hiramatsu!

314
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:47,683
The car in the foreground!

315
00:16:47,684 --> 00:16:49,383
I've got the keys.

316
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:52,683
It's the president's but I drive it so...

317
00:16:52,684 --> 00:16:55,183
Wait! There's a flat!

318
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:57,483
This side is super flat too!

319
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:00,283
The tires of my car are flat too!

320
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:01,684
Darn!

321
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:13,683
In the mountains like this,

322
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:16,483
it's faster to take him to the hospital by car

323
00:17:16,484 --> 00:17:20,483
than to wait for an ambulance but...

324
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:22,083
-Oh, president. -President!

325
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,283
Mr. Umetani.

326
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:25,684
President, please get a hold of yourself!

327
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:31,583
The knife fell off!

328
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,584
What's going on?

329
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:39,583
This is?

330
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:42,883
The knife poked into the cigar case!

331
00:17:42,884 --> 00:17:47,084
Which means that the cigar case saved his life?

332
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:52,984
-President! -Thank god!

333
00:17:54,384 --> 00:17:57,884
Mr. Umetani, what in the world happened?

334
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:03,684
Hiramatsu suddenly stabbed me with a knife.

335
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,483
It seems that there was a thick fog at the time of the accident

336
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:44,283
and besides this slope is steep and the curve is very sharp...

337
00:18:44,284 --> 00:18:46,883
It's most likely that he couldn't steer fast enough

338
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:49,183
while he was on the run.

339
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:51,983
Yeah, most likely...

340
00:18:51,984 --> 00:18:55,183
All the tires of the other cars were flat,

341
00:18:55,184 --> 00:19:00,783
so there was no reason for him to rush as much as he did, though.

342
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:03,783
If he could think on that line,

343
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:06,883
he wouldn't have gotten enraged and stab somebody.

344
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,783
Exactly!

345
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:11,783
Just as expected of you Mr. Mouri, very sharp deduction!

346
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,984
Well...

347
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:22,683
Well, the victim is only slightly hurt,

348
00:19:22,684 --> 00:19:25,483
so we'll be able to get at the motive of the stabber right away.

349
00:19:25,484 --> 00:19:26,584
Right.

350
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:33,583
Sonny! What are you doing?

351
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:35,883
You shouldn't be in here.

352
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:38,683
What's this mirror?

353
00:19:38,684 --> 00:19:40,483
Oh, that?

354
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:42,083
It's called a corner mirror.

355
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:44,283
From here on down, it's the land of that company

356
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,683
and it's a private road.

357
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,083
It seems that nobody is here now, though.

358
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:50,383
See, there's the sign of the company.

359
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:51,983
It says public welfare facility.

360
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,983
Well, it's like a company villa.

361
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:56,983
This large rock is really a pain

362
00:19:56,984 --> 00:19:58,783
and it blocks vision when going in and out

363
00:19:58,784 --> 00:20:00,283
making it really dangerous.

364
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,883
On this side, there's this sharp curve too.

365
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:06,283
There's a curve mirror there for the public road too.

366
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:09,083
Because I'm in charge around here,

367
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:13,483
I wanted a corner mirror for the private road!

368
00:20:13,484 --> 00:20:15,483
I see.

369
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:19,483
The position of the mirror is not right.

370
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,883
It's good that they made a large one,

371
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:23,983
but I wonder if the wind blows it out of place.

372
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:25,983
It was okay in the day time!

373
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:28,683
Oh, I think it's better not to fix it.

374
00:20:28,684 --> 00:20:32,783
It could've been the reason the accident occurred, right?

375
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:35,383
Oh, no!

376
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:41,183
And, Mr. Mouri wants you to check the brakes of the car right away!

377
00:20:41,184 --> 00:20:43,283
Mr. Mouri want me to?

378
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,383
I see!

379
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:46,883
The brakes may have not been working.

380
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:49,983
I'll ask using the wireless so wait a while, okay?

381
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:51,283
Conan!

382
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,983
Just what are you doing in a place like this!

383
00:20:53,984 --> 00:20:57,183
Dad's angry because he wants you to come back up.

384
00:20:57,184 --> 00:20:58,883
I'm sorry.

385
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,483
Hurry, quick.

386
00:21:00,484 --> 00:21:02,184
Oh, wait.

387
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:04,683
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

388
00:21:04,684 --> 00:21:07,183
I tell you! Stop scampering around!

389
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:08,783
I'm going to leave you here!

390
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:10,383
I'm sorry.

391
00:21:10,384 --> 00:21:12,583
Calm down, Mr. Mouri.

392
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:13,984
Mr. Mouri!

393
00:21:15,384 --> 00:21:17,283
Inspector Yokomizo!

394
00:21:17,284 --> 00:21:20,184
About your question a while ago...

395
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:25,483
It seems that the brake oil of the car was completely gone.

396
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,883
-Huh? -What did you just say?

397
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:30,583
I can't tell for sure whether it happened

398
00:21:30,584 --> 00:21:32,183
because of the shock of the accident

399
00:21:32,184 --> 00:21:33,783
or whether it happened before the accident,

400
00:21:33,784 --> 00:21:36,883
but the tube seems to have come off.

401
00:21:36,884 --> 00:21:39,283
Which means, Mr. Mouri...

402
00:21:39,284 --> 00:21:42,784
the oil leaked out and the brakes may not have been working.

403
00:21:44,484 --> 00:21:46,583
It's only natural for him to have gotten into an accident

404
00:21:46,584 --> 00:21:48,684
on this mountainous road.

405
00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:51,983
Strange.

406
00:21:51,984 --> 00:21:54,683
There are too many strange things involved.

407
00:21:54,684 --> 00:21:57,783
A person who gets enraged, stabs someone and flees,

408
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,083
flattens the tires of everyone's car

409
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,383
because he doesn't want anyone to come after him.

410
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:05,783
This same person panics and steers his car out of control,

411
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:07,984
and falls over the cliff to his death.

412
00:22:09,384 --> 00:22:12,084
The curve mirror that was facing the wrong way.

413
00:22:12,984 --> 00:22:15,784
Brake oil that was completely gone.

414
00:22:17,484 --> 00:22:19,583
Something smells fishy.

415
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:21,484
Very fishy!

416
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:03,783
A rope, a stun gun and a death note.

417
00:24:03,784 --> 00:24:06,384
A death note? What's going on?

418
00:24:07,984 --> 00:24:09,883
What's this?

419
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:10,983
What's wrong?

420
00:24:10,984 --> 00:24:13,183
Ran, please call Inspector Yokomizo and the others

421
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:15,883
and tell them to come back!

422
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:21,584
This is a cleverly schemed case of homicide!

423
00:24:21,884 --> 00:24:23,383
Next Conan,
