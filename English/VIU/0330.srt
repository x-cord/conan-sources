1
00:00:03,156 --> 00:00:04,955
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction

2
00:00:04,956 --> 00:00:06,955
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06,956 --> 00:00:08,955
The bond of friendship is shattered by sad mistrust.

4
00:00:08,956 --> 00:00:11,055
Money can't buy happiness.

5
00:00:11,056 --> 00:00:12,655
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,656 --> 00:00:14,455
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,456 --> 00:00:16,556
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,193 --> 00:01:56,992
When we, the Youth Detective Squad,

9
00:01:56,993 --> 00:01:59,392
come along to camp with Dr. Agasa,

10
00:01:59,393 --> 00:02:02,092
we happen to run into four university students

11
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:05,192
who are a part of the Outdoor Club, riding a luxurious camping car.

12
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:07,692
They are Reiji Fukuura,

13
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:09,892
Yasumi Shirafuji

14
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:11,992
Haruka Tendo

15
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:15,292
and Takuto Meshiai.

16
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:18,792
But while we were all having barbecue and chatting away

17
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:21,992
Ms. Shirafuji disappears.

18
00:02:21,993 --> 00:02:23,492
So while we left to look for her,

19
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:26,392
we headed to the scenic point to watch the fireworks

20
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:28,492
but she wasn't there either.

21
00:02:28,493 --> 00:02:30,392
On the way back to the camping grounds,

22
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:32,992
we find Ms. Yasumi Shirafuji lying dead

23
00:02:32,993 --> 00:02:35,793
in the middle of a winding road!

24
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:41,592
Which means that the killer is someone

25
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:44,492
who could freely take the bicycle from the camping car.

26
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:45,592
Yeah.

27
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:48,392
Her friends who belong to the same circle.

28
00:02:48,393 --> 00:02:52,793
The probability of the killer being among the three is high!

29
00:02:57,393 --> 00:03:03,393
"Friendship Torn Apart (Part 2)"

30
00:03:04,193 --> 00:03:06,892
Wait a minute, officer!

31
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:09,892
Why do we have to be questioned for alibi?

32
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:11,792
Yasumi died of an accident, didn't she?

33
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:14,192
Well, it's just to be sure!

34
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:18,992
So, please tell us where you all were

35
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:21,992
around 5 pm to 6 pm when Ms. Yasumi died.

36
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,192
"Haruka Tendo (21)" -Well, we were all doing different things

37
00:03:24,193 --> 00:03:26,792
moving around here and there.

38
00:03:26,793 --> 00:03:29,892
"Takuto Meshiai (23)" -I was fishing alone.

39
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:33,492
"Reiji Fukuura (21)" -I was keeping watch over time and camping!

40
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:36,792
Then, who drives the camping car?

41
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:40,792
Reiji used to be in a car club before so he's good at driving.

42
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:41,892
Hey...

43
00:03:41,893 --> 00:03:44,792
If it's just moving the car, all three of us can do it!

44
00:03:44,793 --> 00:03:47,492
Meshiai sometimes takes over driving for me,

45
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:51,992
and Haruka's the one who brings this car to our meeting place!

46
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:55,092
Why are you asking us something like this?

47
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:57,492
Well, I figured if you can't drive the car,

48
00:03:57,493 --> 00:04:00,492
it would be impossible to move the corpse to where it was.

49
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:03,092
So, you're suspecting us after all?

50
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:04,593
Yeah, right!

51
00:04:06,193 --> 00:04:07,792
If you leave Ms. Yasumi's body

52
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:10,592
in the middle of the street beforehand,

53
00:04:10,593 --> 00:04:15,192
and pretend not to see her on the way uphill,

54
00:04:15,193 --> 00:04:17,492
then act as if you saw her for the first time on your way back,

55
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:19,892
it's not impossible.

56
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:23,292
Moreover, there aren't many cars going through here,

57
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:24,892
and if the driver is the killer

58
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:26,092
with nobody riding in the passenger's seat

59
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:29,092
when going uphill...

60
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:31,692
It's true that when I was driving,

61
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:34,792
nobody was sitting in the passenger's seat.

62
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:36,392
If I drove in the oncoming lane,

63
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:38,092
the view outside the window would change

64
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:40,992
and somebody sitting in the backseat would've noticed,

65
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:44,892
and besides, I could never do such thing as

66
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:47,092
to avoid somebody lying in the middle of the road

67
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:48,692
without changing lanes.

68
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:52,292
Besides, when we passed here the sunroof was open,

69
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:54,592
and we were sticking our heads out of it,

70
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:57,192
but there was nothing on the road.

71
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:59,692
You stuck your heads out of the sunroof?

72
00:04:59,693 --> 00:05:02,092
Yes. When we did so last year,

73
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,892
we saw fireworks from between the mountains.

74
00:05:04,893 --> 00:05:08,092
So, we wanted to show those children the same thing too.

75
00:05:08,093 --> 00:05:10,592
Well, but you can only catch a view of it for about ten seconds

76
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:12,692
until turning at the curve.

77
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:16,492
But if you open the sunroof

78
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:18,192
after you successfully avoid the corpse then...

79
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,092
That is why I said it's impossible to avoid the corpse!

80
00:05:21,093 --> 00:05:24,792
Right. The car didn't weave

81
00:05:24,793 --> 00:05:27,393
before or after the sunroof was opened.

82
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:31,192
What is that?

83
00:05:31,193 --> 00:05:35,092
There are strange looking lines on the edge of the sunroof.

84
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:36,293
It can't be?

85
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:41,392
Conan?

86
00:05:41,393 --> 00:05:43,293
Hey, Conan!

87
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:53,393
What are these lines?

88
00:05:57,293 --> 00:05:59,192
This is blood.

89
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,892
Blood dried in streaks.

90
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:05,192
I see. So, that's the story.

91
00:06:05,193 --> 00:06:07,492
I've figured this case out!

92
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:09,192
And the only one who could've worked out

93
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:11,392
this high-level trick is

94
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:12,993
that person!

95
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,692
My flashlight.

96
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:19,992
There!

97
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:22,792
Thank God. Thank you. Genta!

98
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:24,792
Are you all right?

99
00:06:24,793 --> 00:06:27,292
Thank you, Ai...

100
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:28,992
Please be careful!

101
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:31,392
It's sort of windy today

102
00:06:31,393 --> 00:06:34,392
and the car is slanted because it's a slope here.

103
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,793
It's not too bad up here on the roof of the car, is it?

104
00:06:38,993 --> 00:06:42,193
Because the night view is so nice.

105
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:44,892
This is the place

106
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:48,192
where we watched the fireworks from the car!

107
00:06:48,193 --> 00:06:49,492
It's over here?

108
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,592
Wait a second.

109
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:53,292
Then, the trick that I was thinking of a while ago...

110
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:54,792
Hey, everyone!

111
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:57,493
It's dangerous climbing up a place like that.

112
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:02,592
Conan?

113
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:04,792
Hey, Conan! Where do you think you're going?

114
00:07:04,793 --> 00:07:06,192
Close call...

115
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:09,692
I was about to fall for the killer's trap.

116
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:11,793
The real trick is...

117
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:19,993
I found it! This is it!

118
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:22,692
Did you find something?

119
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,592
Yes, a vinyl sheet.

120
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:26,492
It seems to have blood on it!

121
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:28,892
What?

122
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:30,492
True.

123
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:33,492
We'd better report this right away to Inspector Megure.

124
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:35,792
But I sure am in a fix.

125
00:07:35,793 --> 00:07:38,292
Anybody can use this trick

126
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:40,692
and there is no evidence to specify the killer.

127
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,492
I'll just have to show the sheet

128
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:46,192
and watch how he responds.

129
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:49,392
What? A blood smeared vinyl sheet?

130
00:07:49,393 --> 00:07:52,692
Yes! It was stuck on a guard rail

131
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:55,292
about 50m downhill from here!

132
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:59,192
I see. It sure is blood.

133
00:07:59,193 --> 00:08:02,492
Hey, isn't that the sheet that we always use

134
00:08:02,493 --> 00:08:03,992
when we go camping?

135
00:08:03,993 --> 00:08:05,192
What did you say?

136
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,792
Will you come here and confirm it?

137
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:08,993
Yeah.

138
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:11,492
Just as I thought!

139
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:12,992
Yeah.

140
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,092
We haven't been using it recently

141
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,992
because it has a hole in it.

142
00:08:15,993 --> 00:08:18,592
But why would it be in a place like this?

143
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:19,992
No good.

144
00:08:19,993 --> 00:08:22,692
None of them are reacting at all.

145
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:24,992
I've got to search the mountains

146
00:08:24,993 --> 00:08:27,193
and look for some other evidence.

147
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:32,192
I see. I get it.

148
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:35,292
Blood splattered on the killer.

149
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:38,792
I can understand that it was done on the spur of the moment.

150
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:42,292
But, now the killer has no way out.

151
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:45,193
The killer's made a grave mistake.

152
00:08:48,593 --> 00:08:51,492
So, like I've been telling you!

153
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:53,192
At around 7 pm when we passed here

154
00:08:53,193 --> 00:08:56,192
with the camping car to look for Yasumi,

155
00:08:56,193 --> 00:08:58,192
there was nothing on the road.

156
00:08:58,193 --> 00:09:00,992
And two hours later, when we came back,

157
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:04,992
we found Yasumi lying in the middle of the road!

158
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:08,792
The only thing that was on the road was the wooden fence

159
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:10,792
that fell from right above this road!

160
00:09:10,793 --> 00:09:13,992
And didn't you say so yourself, officer?

161
00:09:13,993 --> 00:09:15,992
That the place where the fence was broken,

162
00:09:15,993 --> 00:09:17,892
the place where the broken piece was

163
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:19,692
and the place where Yasumi's body was

164
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,792
were all in one straight line.

165
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:25,992
The traces of the wheels were found near the broken fence

166
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:28,992
and the bicycle was stuck in the bushes outside the guard rail

167
00:09:28,993 --> 00:09:31,792
where the piece of broken fence was, so...

168
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:34,492
Yasumi probably accidentally crashed through the fence

169
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:38,292
and fell to her death.

170
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:40,292
You also explained that we didn't see Yasumi

171
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,692
when we first passed here

172
00:09:42,693 --> 00:09:45,892
because she was probably stuck in the bushes with her bicycle

173
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:48,192
and then slid down to the road

174
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:52,592
just before we passed here on our way back, didn't you?

175
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,292
Yes, that's right.

176
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:57,692
Then, it was an accident after all!

177
00:09:57,693 --> 00:10:00,692
Why do we have to be suspected?

178
00:10:00,693 --> 00:10:02,892
There are no blood stains

179
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:07,292
on the road that Ms. Yasumi was thought to have fallen to.

180
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:09,992
If she crashed through the fence and fell,

181
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:12,692
isn't it strange that there's not even a drop of blood

182
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:14,392
on the road where she fell?

183
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:17,892
No. Are you saying that Yasumi was...

184
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:20,292
And this vinyl sheet!

185
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:23,992
If these blood stains are Ms. Yasumi's,

186
00:10:23,993 --> 00:10:25,892
it has something to do with the killing...

187
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,692
It sure is connected to the killing!

188
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:28,693
What?

189
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,493
Dr. Agasa?

190
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:33,893
Dr. Agasa.

191
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:35,492
With the window closed,

192
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:38,292
it's hard to hear my deduction, isn't it?

193
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:41,492
Will you please open the sunroof for me?

194
00:10:41,493 --> 00:10:42,993
Oh, yes!

195
00:10:46,493 --> 00:10:49,992
Why are you on top of the car like that?

196
00:10:49,993 --> 00:10:52,292
I just wanted to know what it feels like.

197
00:10:52,293 --> 00:10:54,492
To be loaded on the roof of a camping car after being killed.

198
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,993
Just like how Ms. Yasumi was!

199
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:05,552
To be loaded on the roof of a camping car after being killed.

200
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:08,052
Just like how Ms. Yasumi was!

201
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:11,052
Which means that the killer loaded Ms. Yasumi's body

202
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:13,052
on the roof of this car after all.

203
00:11:13,053 --> 00:11:17,252
Yes! The killer under the pretense of going to look for Ms. Yasumi

204
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:19,852
got into the car together with us

205
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:22,352
and dropped Ms. Yasumi's body

206
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:24,652
from the top of the roof on the way!

207
00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:27,852
Ms. Yasumi was probably killed this way.

208
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,252
The killer probably asked Ms. Yasumi

209
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:34,652
to climb up and wipe the dirty sunroof or something.

210
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:38,452
And Ms. Yasumi probably agreed,

211
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:41,252
which after the killer snuck up behind her and hit her head

212
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:43,952
with a stone or something!

213
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,352
As proof of that, there is a streak of reddish black line

214
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:49,752
on the glass of the sunroof!

215
00:11:49,753 --> 00:11:53,752
A streak of blood that remained in the corner

216
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:57,052
when the killer wiped off the blood that splattered on when he hit her!

217
00:11:57,053 --> 00:11:58,752
But, gramps,

218
00:11:58,753 --> 00:12:03,052
how was Yasumi's body dropped just right in place like that?

219
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:06,552
We were all in the car, you know?

220
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:08,152
Fukuura.

221
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:11,152
When you tried to avoid the fence

222
00:12:11,153 --> 00:12:12,652
that came falling on the road right above,

223
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:15,352
you slammed on the brakes and drifted slightly, didn't you?

224
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:17,552
Yeah. So what?

225
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:19,852
I see. You took advantage of the impact of drifting

226
00:12:19,853 --> 00:12:22,052
and made the body go over the guard rail,

227
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:24,852
throwing it onto the road below.

228
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:27,852
You left the debris of the fence on the road

229
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:32,152
as a marker as to where to drift the car.

230
00:12:32,153 --> 00:12:36,552
That way, you would be able to find the body on the way back.

231
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:37,752
Hold it.

232
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:41,552
But there are many sharp curves before passing that road!

233
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,252
If the dead body's not fastened to something,

234
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:45,352
it would fall way before that point!

235
00:12:45,353 --> 00:12:49,052
Were there masking tape or ropes on Yasumi's body?

236
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:50,552
About that...

237
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:54,652
Come to think of it, her belt.

238
00:12:54,653 --> 00:12:59,452
That is the same one that Yoko Okino was wearing the other day!

239
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:02,152
Something was on her belt!

240
00:13:02,153 --> 00:13:04,452
But how could that have been used?

241
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:06,053
Didn't you notice?

242
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:10,052
The decoration on the tip of her belt,

243
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:13,452
only one edge was tied.

244
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:15,952
Yeah, I saw that too.

245
00:13:15,953 --> 00:13:18,252
I thought it was a fashion of some kind.

246
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:21,152
Oh, right! I forgot to show you something.

247
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:22,252
Officer Takagi!

248
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:24,452
Will you please close the sunroof for now?

249
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:27,652
Oh, all right.

250
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:30,152
See! There's the blood streak I mentioned a while ago!

251
00:13:30,153 --> 00:13:32,352
It's a little away from the edge, isn't it?

252
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,952
Why do you think it's that way?

253
00:13:34,953 --> 00:13:37,252
It's probably because the sunroof was a little open

254
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:40,052
when the person killed Kazumi!

255
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:43,552
Why was the sunroof a little open?

256
00:13:43,553 --> 00:13:45,052
What do you mean why?

257
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:46,752
I see!

258
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:50,252
If one edge of the belt was tied, then...

259
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:51,652
Exactly!

260
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:55,052
The killer pinched the tied part to the sunroof

261
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:58,252
and fixed Ms. Yasumi's body in place on top of the car!

262
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:01,152
After bending her body in half!

263
00:14:01,153 --> 00:14:03,552
The killer left the sunroof a little open

264
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:06,352
so that he could carry out the murder smoothly.

265
00:14:06,353 --> 00:14:08,652
The killer left it open because unless they did so,

266
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:12,952
after they hit Ms. Yasumi to death on top of the car,

267
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:16,252
they would've had to go down, open the sunroof,

268
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:19,952
then climb up again to stick the string between the sunroof

269
00:14:19,953 --> 00:14:24,052
and finally come down again to close the sunroof.

270
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:28,152
Since there is only one button to open the sunroof by the driver's seat.

271
00:14:28,153 --> 00:14:31,252
You did say a while ago that when you first passed by here,

272
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:34,552
you opened the sunroof and watched the fireworks,

273
00:14:34,553 --> 00:14:36,152
but who opened it?

274
00:14:36,153 --> 00:14:38,752
Of course, I did since I was driving the car.

275
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,452
Haruka asked me to open it so...

276
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:42,952
That was because...

277
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:47,352
I just wanted to do what was good last year, this year too.

278
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,852
I see. If so, it's not difficult to assume that

279
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:53,452
someone will ask to open the sunroof this year too.

280
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:56,152
Even if it is not so, since you're at the driver's seat,

281
00:14:56,153 --> 00:14:58,952
you could secretly open it without anybody noticing it.

282
00:14:58,953 --> 00:15:00,652
Hey.

283
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:02,952
You opened the sunroof

284
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:05,452
and removed the tied part that was stuck to the window

285
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:07,652
and let the corpse go free then you drifted the car on the road

286
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:10,652
where the piece of broken fence was,

287
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:13,552
and swing her body down on the road below.

288
00:15:13,553 --> 00:15:16,252
In other words, the one who can work out this trick

289
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:18,752
is the one with skilled driving techniques like you

290
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:20,852
who used to belong to a car club!

291
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,753
You'd think so, right?

292
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:26,952
But, the fact is not so!

293
00:15:26,953 --> 00:15:29,852
Actually, I thought so at first too.

294
00:15:29,853 --> 00:15:31,852
But, I had forgotten that

295
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:35,052
this car had been going uphill

296
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:39,252
and this was just the place where the sunroof was opened!

297
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:43,952
But, after seeing the blood smeared vinyl sheet it dawned on me!

298
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:46,652
If the vinyl sheet is laid under the body of the corpse

299
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:49,252
and friction is decreased,

300
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:51,252
it's easy.

301
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:53,552
The minute the the sunroof is opened

302
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,052
because of the impact of the wind and the slope,

303
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:58,352
the dead body would slide off the top of the car!

304
00:15:58,353 --> 00:16:04,552
Which means that any of you three could've committed the murder.

305
00:16:04,553 --> 00:16:06,352
I'm very sorry to say this,

306
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:09,152
but I would like you all to come to the station with me.

307
00:16:09,153 --> 00:16:12,252
You don't have to do that!

308
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:15,552
Because the killer has made a mistake wearing clothes!

309
00:16:15,553 --> 00:16:17,052
Wearing clothes?

310
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:21,152
Will you three stand up and go out to the corridor?

311
00:16:21,153 --> 00:16:23,352
Geez. I'll tell you.

312
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:27,752
So, what can you find out doing something like this?

313
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,052
What's the matter, Ayumi?

314
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:33,352
See, her belt...

315
00:16:33,353 --> 00:16:37,052
Her belt is not through the belt loop of her jeans!

316
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:38,852
Then, don't tell me that...

317
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:40,552
You're the killer?

318
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:44,452
No! I was in a rush when coming from home.

319
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:48,452
Ayumi, you took a picture of everyone, didn't you?

320
00:16:48,453 --> 00:16:49,552
Yes.

321
00:16:49,553 --> 00:16:54,052
If I remember it right, I think you took a rear view shot of her too,

322
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:57,752
Wait a second...

323
00:16:57,753 --> 00:16:59,852
Here it is! This is the one!

324
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:03,952
But her belt is through the belt loop like it should be!

325
00:17:03,953 --> 00:17:05,552
It was through the belt loop at first

326
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:08,152
and why isn't it now?

327
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:11,852
Well I took a shower in this camping car at sundown

328
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:13,352
so I may have done it then.

329
00:17:13,353 --> 00:17:15,652
Is it necessary to remove your belt

330
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:18,752
when you take off your jeans?

331
00:17:18,753 --> 00:17:22,552
It's because I changed into a different pair of jeans.

332
00:17:22,553 --> 00:17:24,652
You've changed jeans.

333
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:25,852
Yes.

334
00:17:25,853 --> 00:17:28,252
Could I have a look at it?

335
00:17:28,253 --> 00:17:29,453
Yes.

336
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:33,852
It sure looks like the one you're wearing

337
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,552
is the same as the one in this picture

338
00:17:36,553 --> 00:17:38,752
although you say you changed jeans.

339
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:40,552
Well, I guess so.

340
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:42,152
Then, I don't mean to be rude,

341
00:17:42,153 --> 00:17:43,952
but can you please show it to me?

342
00:17:43,953 --> 00:17:46,352
The jeans you wore before you changed.

343
00:17:46,353 --> 00:17:47,452
Well...

344
00:17:47,453 --> 00:17:50,552
You can't show it to him even if you wanted to, right?

345
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:54,852
It's probably the jeans that you were wearing when you hit Ms. Yasumi,

346
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:56,652
and you threw it away in the mountains

347
00:17:56,653 --> 00:17:59,252
somewhere with the clothes you were wearing back then, right?

348
00:17:59,253 --> 00:18:03,153
Because they were splattered with Ms. Yasumi's blood!

349
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:08,052
But she let us ride this car

350
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,552
when we went to go watch the fireworks!

351
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:11,652
Right!

352
00:18:11,653 --> 00:18:13,152
Why would she want us to ride in the car

353
00:18:13,153 --> 00:18:15,852
that she had the dead body on?

354
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:19,152
Rather, she had to make us ride the car!

355
00:18:19,153 --> 00:18:22,152
If I followed this camping car with my car from behind,

356
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:26,053
I would see the dead body sliding off the camping car.

357
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:28,752
But...

358
00:18:28,753 --> 00:18:32,652
you're so rich.

359
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,853
I'm not rich.

360
00:18:35,953 --> 00:18:37,952
I'm an ordinary university student

361
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:40,152
with no special talent.

362
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,552
That's why unless I acted rich,

363
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:45,452
nobody would even look at me.

364
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:47,552
I really had a tough time.

365
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:49,852
I worked part-time with all my might

366
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:52,252
and even borrowed money to rent this expensive camping car

367
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:55,452
in order to bring everybody to the beach and the mountains.

368
00:18:55,453 --> 00:18:58,152
But because they were the first friends I had,

369
00:18:58,153 --> 00:18:59,652
so I did my best...

370
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:03,852
Yes. I thought they were my friends.

371
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:07,053
Until I heard what Yasumi said.

372
00:19:09,853 --> 00:19:11,552
Didn't you know?

373
00:19:11,553 --> 00:19:13,452
It's all just a bunch of lies

374
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,152
that she's from a rich family!

375
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:17,352
I could tell right off the bat that she wasn't.

376
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:19,352
So I followed her.

377
00:19:19,353 --> 00:19:21,852
Sure enough, she was living in a rundown apartment!

378
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:25,152
Which means I was being deceived for four years?

379
00:19:25,153 --> 00:19:29,952
Then why don't you tell her to stop lying?

380
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:31,152
You're her best friend, aren't you?

381
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:32,452
Yasumi.

382
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:33,952
Best friend?

383
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:35,952
All she means to me is money.

384
00:19:35,953 --> 00:19:37,652
If not, do you think I could pretend that I didn't know

385
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:39,752
for four years?

386
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:42,552
It was really tough for me to keep from laughing though.

387
00:19:42,553 --> 00:19:45,452
Besides, if I told her and she gets angry at me

388
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:47,452
demanding to get back all she dished out up to now,

389
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:48,652
what would I do?

390
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:51,252
I don't think she's that kind of girl.

391
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:54,352
Too bad, Reiji.

392
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:56,152
I guess you were sort of looking forward to getting rich, right?

393
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,152
Yes. It's too bad.

394
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:00,852
I guess I'll bid her farewell as soon as we graduate.

395
00:20:00,853 --> 00:20:03,552
Well, I guess I'll have her devote herself and money to me till then.

396
00:20:03,553 --> 00:20:06,053
Dear Ms. Richie-Rich, Haruka!

397
00:20:08,753 --> 00:20:11,052
I believed.

398
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:14,752
I believed that they were my best friends!

399
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:17,252
That's why you killed Yasumi

400
00:20:17,253 --> 00:20:18,952
and tried to frame Reiji up as the killer.

401
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:22,452
Yes! I got angry at her just as she thought I would!

402
00:20:22,453 --> 00:20:25,052
At that woman who had dared to step all over my feelings of friendship!

403
00:20:25,053 --> 00:20:27,653
That's not being friends at all!

404
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:33,352
That's not being friends at all to begin with!

405
00:20:33,353 --> 00:20:35,052
Yes, she's right.

406
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:38,152
It's no better than the vending machine of juice cans.

407
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,052
If you put money into the machine, it will quench your thirst,

408
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:44,552
but if you don't insert money, it won't give you anything.

409
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:48,153
You can't buy people's hearts with money.

410
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:36,352
Ai's final remark was splendid!

411
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:39,252
Yes, it made me feel good!

412
00:22:39,253 --> 00:22:42,152
You sure can make good remarks when you want to, right, Haibara?

413
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,452
Not really.

414
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:47,253
It's some phrase I heard somebody else say.

415
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:53,652
I thought that's how it would normally be.

416
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:57,952
Back then, Ran refused Sonoko's invitation to go skiing with her.

417
00:22:57,953 --> 00:22:59,352
When I asked her why,

418
00:22:59,353 --> 00:23:01,352
she told me a bit depressed,

419
00:23:01,353 --> 00:23:02,852
that she didn't have enough allowance that month.

420
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:07,052
I told her to have rich Sonoko pay her way too,

421
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:10,552
then she angrily looked at me and said...

422
00:23:10,553 --> 00:23:12,652
I would never do such a thing

423
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:16,452
because I want to stay friends with Sonoko forever.

424
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:17,553
That's what she said.

425
00:23:19,253 --> 00:23:20,652
That's why I felt that

426
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:22,852
their relationship with Haruka seemed kind of fake.

427
00:23:22,853 --> 00:23:25,352
They seemed to be flattering her

428
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:27,253
only because she was rich.

429
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:32,152
But, you were really cool!

430
00:23:32,153 --> 00:23:33,652
Ai...

431
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:35,953
It's okay. You can call me informally.

432
00:23:37,053 --> 00:23:39,852
You want to call me informally, don't you?

433
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:42,853
Really, Ai?

434
00:23:46,653 --> 00:23:48,052
Then can...

435
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,252
We call you informally too.

436
00:23:50,253 --> 00:23:51,852
No, the rest of you can't.

437
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:52,953
-Okay. -Okay.

438
00:23:58,253 --> 00:24:03,953
"Next Episode" -I want to see Sonoko's villa in Karuizawa too!

439
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:07,852
And besides, knowing Sonoko for what she is,

440
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:12,053
she'll probably think up some bad ideas like always.

441
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:13,752
What?

442
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,453
He's not in bed.

443
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:24,052
