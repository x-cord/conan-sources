00:00:00,781 --> 00:00:03,081
"Mouri Detective Agency."

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:08,281
Dad was suddenly invited to a party.

3
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:12,581
That's why Pops' Sunday suit is hanging outside.

4
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:14,981
Right. And this is done.

5
00:00:17,323 --> 00:00:18,523
What is wrong?

6
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:24,023
I'd like to give Shinichi a better tie.

7
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:34,423
What're you blushing for, Conan?

8
00:00:34,423 --> 00:00:36,523
Well...

9
00:00:36,523 --> 00:00:37,923
Where's Pops?

10
00:00:37,923 --> 00:00:39,523
At the barber.

11
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:41,023
He's late, isn't he?

12
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:43,323
I'll go get him then.

13
00:00:48,123 --> 00:00:50,023
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

14
00:00:50,023 --> 00:00:52,223
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

15
00:00:52,223 --> 00:00:53,823
What is the secret of the strange eye-witness

16
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:55,623
who was at the site, but didn't see what happened?

17
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:57,423
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:59,423
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:00:59,423 --> 00:01:01,723
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

"The Witness Who Didn't See."

21
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:55,971
What a day, all the barbers are filled today.

22
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:01,571
"Open."

23
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:02,971
Hold it!

24
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:06,271
Wait up!

25
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:12,071
I'm closing already.

26
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:14,571
Sorry, I'm in a rush.

27
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:21,171
There's another customer here too.

28
00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:22,971
Please. If you do me first,

29
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:24,871
I promise to patronize you shop from here on.

30
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,171
All right.

31
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:29,371
Since he's fast asleep, I'll do you first.

32
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:30,771
Thanks.

33
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:34,171
Hot, hot!

34
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:35,571
One moment please.

35
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:42,671
I wonder what kind of dishes are going to be served at today's party?

36
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:45,071
French cuisine would be just great.

37
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:48,771
Chinese food's not bad either,

38
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:51,171
shark's fin and Peking duck.

39
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:57,471
It's the shuttle bus of the swimming school that opened recently.

40
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:02,371
Hei. It's a noisy like always.

41
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:04,871
It's so noisy.

42
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:09,071
I'll sue them for disturbing the public. Darn!

43
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:13,971
I wish they'd hurry and go somewhere else.

44
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:16,971
Cut out the noise, cut out the noise. Darn.

45
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:22,871
Thank God...

46
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:27,571
What?

47
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:28,771
What is it?

48
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:37,671
He's dead.

49
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:39,571
Ebihara?

50
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:43,871
Pops!

51
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:45,371
You weren't at the usual shop,

52
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:46,771
so I came searching for you!

53
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:49,671
Conan! Didn't you see anyone suspicious?

54
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:51,371
No, I didn't.

55
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:53,171
Is anything wrong?

56
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:54,571
Please call the police.

57
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:57,171
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,571
-Pops. -Hey! Conan.

59
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:00,571
Children out...

60
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:01,671
This is...

61
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,271
Hey.

62
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:11,071
Okay. I'm going to fly this one more time.

63
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:12,671
Hey, Genta!

64
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:14,171
Conan.

65
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:16,471
Didn't anyone come out of here?

66
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:18,971
Nobody came out!

67
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:21,071
Is anything wrong?

68
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:25,371
I wonder if something happened?

69
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:30,571
Darn!

70
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:32,971
A murder was committed right behind me.

71
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:34,271
Audacious dare-devil.

72
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:36,971
Who on earth are you?

73
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:40,671
I'm the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri.

74
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:42,171
You mean that famous...

75
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:43,971
Exactly.

76
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:47,671
Conan, is it another case?

77
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:51,471
Hey, children aren't allowed inside!

78
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:52,871
That goes for you too.

79
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:54,671
Yes, you're right.

80
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:59,471
And, when I turned to look surprised at the loud noise,

81
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:02,771
the owner of this shop, Mr. Ebihara was lying on the floor.

82
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:04,971
He was already dead.

83
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:06,371
I see.

84
00:06:06,371 --> 00:06:10,871
Your ears heard every detail of what happened, right?

85
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,671
Yes, sir.

86
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:15,471
So, what you heard was this fall?

87
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:16,871
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:19,471
It was on the cash register counter.

89
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:20,671
It probably fell

90
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,271
when Mr. Ebihara's arm touched it as he collapsed.

91
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:25,571
I see.

92
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:32,671
Why is only that dart on the ground such a distance away?

93
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:34,371
Mr. Noda, was it?

94
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:36,871
You say you were fast asleep

95
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:39,371
when Mr. Mouri walked in here?

96
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:40,371
"Masao Noda (43)" -Yes, sir...

97
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:45,071
That's why I didn't notice Mr. Mouri coming here at all.

98
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,671
At around what time did you come here?

99
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:51,271
Well... since I was looking around or a shop that was opened

100
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:53,471
that I'm not sure what time it was.

101
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:55,571
But, the incident occurred

102
00:06:55,571 --> 00:06:58,471
only several minutes after I entered the shop.

103
00:06:58,471 --> 00:07:00,371
We got report of the incident by phone

104
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:03,271
at the police at around 6:36 pm,

105
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:08,071
so Mr. Mouri would've entered the shop around 6:30 pm.

106
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:11,071
Around what time did you come?

107
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:14,071
At around 6:20 pm.

108
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:16,871
Only, because of daily exhaustion,

109
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:20,271
I fell asleep as soon as I sat in the chair.

110
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:24,671
And, are you sure that no one went in or out

111
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,971
of this shop on the day the incident occurred?

112
00:07:26,971 --> 00:07:28,271
Yes, sir.

113
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:29,471
Just about that time,

114
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:33,471
the shuttle bus of the swimming school was in front of the shop.

115
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,671
I think it would be impossible for anyone to go in and out of the shop

116
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:37,271
without being seen by anyone.

117
00:07:37,271 --> 00:07:40,571
I didn't seen anybody come out of the shop too.

118
00:07:40,571 --> 00:07:43,471
There's no one who went out of the back door either?

119
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:46,071
No. Nobody did.

120
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:50,171
We were playing all the while at the vacant lot in back.

121
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:52,771
The culprit probably threw the dart

122
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:56,171
from outside the shop and killed Mr. Ebihara.

123
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:57,571
From outside?

124
00:07:57,571 --> 00:08:00,171
Just at that time the shuttle bus of the swimming school

125
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:03,971
was playing music so loud that it was nothing but noise.

126
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:08,071
I'm sure the owner opened the window to complain.

127
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,371
So, the culprit took this opportunity

128
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:12,371
to throw the dart at him.

129
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:15,671
Right. The culprit was probably hiding

130
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:17,571
in the alley in front of the shop.

131
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:20,271
From the alley to here is about 4 m,

132
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:23,171
so a dart would make its mark considering the distance.

133
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:26,871
It seems that poison was smeared on the tip of the dart.

134
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:31,271
I wonder why Mr. Ebihara was wearing a wig?

135
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:35,471
It's true that he doesn't look like he needs a wig.

136
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:37,071
What do you think, Mr. Noda?

137
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:38,371
I wonder...

138
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:43,171
A reason for wearing a wig...

139
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:48,671
Mr. Ebihara is wearing a strange sweatshirt, isn't he?

140
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:52,371
That's a sweatshirt that the members of the darts bar.

141
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:54,771
Darts Lovers Club that was established in the neighborhood wore.

142
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:57,671
Darts Lover Club?

143
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:00,571
-Are you a member too? -Yes, sir.

144
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:04,771
One who patronizes the darts bar is killed with a dart.

145
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:06,271
It could be that the culprit is someone

146
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:09,371
who also frequents the darts bar.

147
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:16,171
They both frequent the darts bar.

148
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,171
"Nozomu Shimazaki (28)" -Mr. Nozomu Shimazaki who works

149
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:21,171
for a linen service company,

150
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:24,571
"Tatsutaro Koike (45)" -and Mr. Tatsutaro Koike who works

151
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:26,371
at a pharmacy in the neighborhood.

152
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:29,071
I hear that you got into an argument

153
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:31,771
with Mr. Ebihara at the darts bar last night.

154
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,271
No...

155
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:35,571
It's because that old man Ebihara

156
00:09:35,571 --> 00:09:38,371
started saying this and that's that weren't true.

157
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:40,571
What kind of this and that's?

158
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:41,771
Well...

159
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:44,971
Mr. Ebihara started accusing.

160
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:47,071
Mr. Shimazaki of embezzling money from the company,

161
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:49,671
so Mr. Shimazaki got angry and grabbed him by the neck,

162
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:53,171
so all I did was go in between them to stop them.

163
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:55,571
You gotta be joking! You went pale too,

164
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:59,571
when he accused you of making up for the red of your store

165
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:00,971
by putting goods on the black market.

166
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:02,871
No way...

167
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:09,371
Noda, you're still coughing?

168
00:10:09,371 --> 00:10:11,271
Why aren't you wearing a mask?

169
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:13,171
I must've dropped it somewhere.

170
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:16,871
Mr. Noda, although you're standing there like this has nothing to with you,

171
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:20,071
but you borrowed money from old man Ebihara too, didn't you?

172
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:24,871
Right, Ebihara said that he lent you money to manage your shop.

173
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,371
Well, how about it?

174
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:28,271
It's true I borrowed money from him,

175
00:10:28,271 --> 00:10:30,371
but it wasn't all that much.

176
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:31,571
I wonder about that.

177
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:34,971
You were at the barbershop on the day of the incident, weren't you?

178
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:36,971
Doesn't that make you really suspicious?

179
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:41,071
No, Mr. Noda was sitting in the chair

180
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:44,271
next to mine at the time Mr. Ebihara was murdered.

181
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:46,071
He couldn't have committed the murder.

182
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:48,771
Who are you? Acting like some big shot.

183
00:10:48,771 --> 00:10:51,871
I'm the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri.

184
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:54,671
-What? -What? The Sleeping Kogoro.

185
00:10:54,671 --> 00:10:58,371
By the way, where were you two

186
00:10:58,371 --> 00:11:00,071
at around 6:30 pm in the evening?

187
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:01,671
Mr. Koike, first.

188
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:03,771
I was at the shop.

189
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:06,771
Do you have anyone that will testify that for you?

190
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:08,571
I think not.

191
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:10,171
There were no customers

192
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:13,671
and my wife is the kitchen preparing dinner.

193
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:15,571
So no one else?

194
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:19,271
But, I didn't do it. Please believe me.

195
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:21,471
How about you, Mr. Shimazaki?

196
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,971
At about 6:30 pm

197
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:25,171
I was still in the midst of making deliveries.

198
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:27,771
That's right, I stopped over at a service station.

199
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,771
A service station?

200
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:32,871
Then, the employee there would remember you if we want to confirm it?

201
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:35,471
No, it was a self-service gas station

202
00:11:35,471 --> 00:11:37,071
so I didn't see any employee.

203
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,271
But, I have the receipt.

204
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:44,171
6:24 pm.

205
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,971
Even if I were to come here from that service station at top speed,

206
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:49,071
it would take 30 minutes.

207
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:51,371
I saw that man a while ago.

208
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:52,971
Where did you see him?

209
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:54,571
In front of this shop.

210
00:11:54,571 --> 00:11:57,771
He was just about to come out of the shop.

211
00:11:57,771 --> 00:12:00,171
What time was that?

212
00:12:00,171 --> 00:12:01,571
In the evening.

213
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:06,471
Let's see, I saw the clock through the window of the shop.

214
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:08,471
It was 5:50 pm.

215
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:10,471
That clock...

216
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:14,771
4:15 pm?

217
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:17,671
What? 7:45 pm?

218
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:22,771
That clock is a mirror image.

219
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:25,071
So that the customers can see what time it is through the mirror.

220
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:26,571
I see.

221
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:28,671
So, he finally got it.

222
00:12:28,671 --> 00:12:30,971
It used to be an ordinary clock until some time ago, right?

223
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:33,371
When did you deliver it to him?

224
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:35,271
Oh, yeah, last night.

225
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:39,071
Which means that the time Ayumi saw Mr. Shimazaki,

226
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:42,971
was not at 5:50 pm, but rather, 6:10 pm.

227
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,771
If he left here at 6:10 pm,

228
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:49,271
he couldn't have made it to the service station by 6:24 pm.

229
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:54,171
Well, I did come here to retrieve towels.

230
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:57,671
And, I got into an argument with him about the night before,

231
00:12:57,671 --> 00:12:59,171
but I still had deliveries to make,

232
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:01,471
so I left right away.

233
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:04,171
Just as she says, it was before 6:00 pm.

234
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:07,871
So, since that clock is a mirror image clock,

235
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,671
it was 6:10 pm.

236
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:12,671
Wrong. It was before 6:00 pm.

237
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:16,771
Mr. Shimazaki, you killed Mr. Ebihara

238
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:18,671
because he accused you of embezzlement.

239
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:20,371
Don't be ridiculous.

240
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:23,171
After leaving the shop, you hid yourself in the alley

241
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:25,671
and killed Mr. Ebihara when he opened the window.

242
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,071
I could never do it, not with my skill.

243
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:31,671
I'm the worst darts player in the Darts Lovers Club.

244
00:13:31,671 --> 00:13:35,271
Right, you could do it, Mr. Koike.

245
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:37,071
What're you talking about?

246
00:13:37,071 --> 00:13:39,771
You're the best player among all of us!

247
00:13:39,771 --> 00:13:42,671
There was poison smeared on the dart used as a murder weapon!

248
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:44,371
Since Mr. Koike is a pharmacist,

249
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:47,871
he could mix and make poison, couldn't he?

250
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:50,171
Don't be ridiculous.

251
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:53,471
Mr. Koike, you're the killer!

252
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:55,071
No!

253
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,871
Which one's the killer?

254
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:58,171
If you're a famed detective,

255
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,571
I wish you would clarify who it is.

256
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:04,571
Talk about unreliability.

257
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:06,671
You guys get out of here!

258
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:10,671
Shoots, miser!

259
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:13,971
We're also making important testimonies, and yet!

260
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:15,671
Right! Right!

261
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:22,071
If the culprit got a poisoned dart ready,

262
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:25,371
it's obviously a planned crime.

263
00:14:25,371 --> 00:14:29,371
If so, would the culprit throw the dart from this far?

264
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:36,771
The clock is not in view from the window.

265
00:14:36,771 --> 00:14:39,971
Ayumi, where did you see the clock from?

266
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:43,871
Let's see.

267
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:45,471
Around here.

268
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:47,171
That's strange,

269
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:49,071
I can't see the clock.

270
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:51,571
But I did see it a while ago.

271
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:54,871
The clock was moved? But, why?

272
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:02,971
I see.

273
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:04,371
That's what it was.

274
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,871
I got it.

275
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:09,371
He's the culprit.

276
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:20,635
Mr. Shimazaki and Mr. Koike,

277
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:22,235
please come to the police station with me

278
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:23,435
and tell us about the details.

279
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:24,935
No.

280
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:32,435
Please wait.

281
00:15:33,735 --> 00:15:37,235
I will solve this case right here and now.

282
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:39,135
What?

283
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:42,735
Are you saying that you've figured out the truth of the case?

284
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:44,535
The fact is that the culprit

285
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:47,135
was at the shop even before I got here.

286
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:49,835
And, he's still here.

287
00:15:50,935 --> 00:15:53,135
What?

288
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:55,535
Yes, the culprit is...

289
00:15:55,535 --> 00:15:57,335
Mr. Noda,

290
00:15:57,335 --> 00:15:58,535
it's you.

291
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:03,435
Mr. Noda, you...

292
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:06,235
Come on, Mr. Mouri.

293
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:11,135
Back then, I was sitting in the chair next to you.

294
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:15,035
When you heard something fall and turned to look,

295
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:19,535
Mr. Noda also just got up from his chair, didn't he?

296
00:16:19,535 --> 00:16:24,535
Mr. Ebihara wasn't killed when that sound was heard.

297
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:29,035
The fact is, he was already killed when I got here.

298
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:31,635
-What? -Don't be ridiculous.

299
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:35,835
You met Mr. Ebihara when you came here, didn't you?

300
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:39,935
Yes, I met a person who had disheveled hair,

301
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,235
wearing a mask and wearing a Darts Lovers Club sweatshirt.

302
00:16:44,235 --> 00:16:46,335
That was Ebihara.

303
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,635
No, that was you in disguise.

304
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,035
Disguise?

305
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:54,335
You quickly put on a wig and mask so as not to be recognized

306
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:57,435
because I suddenly came bursting in here.

307
00:16:57,435 --> 00:17:02,535
Mr. Noda, you still actually have the mask with you, don't you?

308
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:05,635
Then, where was Mr. Ebihara's dead body?

309
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:08,635
On the chair next to me.

310
00:17:08,635 --> 00:17:10,035
An apron was put on him

311
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:13,135
and he had a steamed towel on his face.

312
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:14,835
What?

313
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:18,835
Mr. Noda, after killing Mr. Ebihara in this shop,

314
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:20,135
you were planning to walk out of this shop

315
00:17:20,135 --> 00:17:22,735
as if nothing happened.

316
00:17:22,735 --> 00:17:25,335
However, I happened to come in just then.

317
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,135
I was lead to believe that you were the owner

318
00:17:27,135 --> 00:17:30,435
because of your sudden disguise.

319
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:33,535
Therefore, you put a steamed towel

320
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:34,735
on my face to cover my eyes

321
00:17:34,735 --> 00:17:37,235
and tried to flee out the backdoor.

322
00:17:37,235 --> 00:17:40,235
But, children were playing in the vacant lot in back,

323
00:17:40,235 --> 00:17:41,935
so you couldn't flee.

324
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,535
You couldn't go out from the front either

325
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:48,135
because there were people there too.

326
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:51,735
That's when the swimming school shuttle bus came by.

327
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:53,535
A shuttle bus?

328
00:17:53,535 --> 00:17:56,335
With the loud music that was playing from the bus,

329
00:17:56,335 --> 00:17:58,535
you hit upon an idea.

330
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:02,135
You decided to change places with the dead body and yourself

331
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:03,635
using this noise to your advantage.

332
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:07,335
In the midst of that loud noise

333
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:10,135
most other sounds would be erased.

334
00:18:10,135 --> 00:18:13,935
You quickly lay the body down in front of the counter

335
00:18:13,935 --> 00:18:16,135
and sat yourself down in the chair in place of it.

336
00:18:16,135 --> 00:18:18,635
Then, how did he drop the things

337
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:20,335
that were on the counter?

338
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:22,735
He threw a dart.

339
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:26,135
There's a dart on the ground below the window.

340
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:27,335
I see.

341
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:31,035
Then, you pretended to wake up surprised by the loud noised

342
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:35,535
and along with me, became the first to discover the body.

343
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:37,635
Is that so.

344
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:39,435
But, Mr. Mouri,

345
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:41,435
why did Mr. Noda go out of his way

346
00:18:41,435 --> 00:18:43,435
to put the dead body in the chair?

347
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:46,035
He didn't know you were coming, did he?

348
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:50,635
Mr. Ebihara was killed when he was sitting in the chair.

349
00:18:50,635 --> 00:18:54,135
Why would the owner of a barber shop sit in the chair?

350
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:57,035
He was confirming the position of the clock.

351
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,035
The position of the clock?

352
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:00,735
That clock was brought here today

353
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,535
before the murder was committed.

354
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:07,835
I saw it from outside just a while ago...

355
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:10,635
Conan, when did you get here?

356
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:13,835
But, I couldn't see it from the window.

357
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:15,535
You couldn't see it?

358
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:17,135
Just what do you mean?

359
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:20,335
Maybe the clock was originally somewhere around there?

360
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:22,335
Yeah, that's right.

361
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:24,435
It was over there before.

362
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:27,335
If it's from that position you can see it, right?

363
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:30,635
When Ayumi saw Mr. Shimazaki,

364
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:34,135
a normal clock was still hung there.

365
00:19:34,135 --> 00:19:35,935
Then, Mr. Noda came along later

366
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:39,635
and hung a mirror display clock there.

367
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:42,035
And, in order to check the position,

368
00:19:42,035 --> 00:19:45,335
Mr. Ebihara sat in the chair.

369
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:46,935
Then, the culprit pinned him down from behind

370
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,035
and poked the dart into his chest.

371
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:51,035
Then, the culprit placed a steamed towel on his face

372
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:53,235
and placed an apron on top of him.

373
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:56,435
He did so, that if in case someone were to look into the shop,

374
00:19:56,435 --> 00:20:00,235
it would just look like someone were waiting for a shave.

375
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:02,135
But, you just so happened to come

376
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:04,635
before the culprit could flee.

377
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:07,635
But, where is the original clock, then?

378
00:20:07,635 --> 00:20:09,935
I found it in the shoe cabinet by the back door.

379
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:11,935
That's all baloney.

380
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:13,835
Do you have proof that the first person

381
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:17,235
you met was me in disguise, Mr. Mouri?

382
00:20:17,235 --> 00:20:21,035
Mr. Noda, isn't what you're wearing under that shirt,

383
00:20:21,035 --> 00:20:23,635
the sweatshirt of the darts lovers club?

384
00:20:23,635 --> 00:20:26,135
Will you please take it off and show us all of it?

385
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:29,035
Please, will you?

386
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:31,235
All right.

387
00:20:41,535 --> 00:20:44,135
Nothing's written on it.

388
00:20:44,135 --> 00:20:46,235
Too bad.

389
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:52,535
I won't fall for a childish trick like that.

390
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:56,435
Officer Takagi, take off Mr. Noda's shirt.

391
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:57,635
Quickly.

392
00:20:57,635 --> 00:20:58,835
Yes, sir.

393
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:00,935
What do you think you're doing? Stop it.

394
00:21:00,935 --> 00:21:01,935
Let me go.

395
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:14,935
He was wearing it back to front.

396
00:21:14,935 --> 00:21:16,935
He quickly changed it

397
00:21:16,935 --> 00:21:19,035
while switching himself with the body.

398
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:23,735
No one other than the culprit has any reason to wear it backwards.

399
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:25,835
Noda, why did you...

400
00:21:28,935 --> 00:21:31,235
The IOU that I wrote out to Ebihara

401
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:33,735
when I borrowed money from him

402
00:21:33,735 --> 00:21:36,635
was handed over to a loan shark.

403
00:21:36,635 --> 00:21:38,335
-What? -What?

404
00:21:38,335 --> 00:21:41,035
Money collectors came every day demanding to get their money back,

405
00:21:41,035 --> 00:21:43,235
that my wife had a neurotic breakdown.

406
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,035
Why'd Mr. Ebihara do something like that?

407
00:21:46,035 --> 00:21:49,235
He was the one who originally was in debt.

408
00:21:49,235 --> 00:21:52,435
But he sold me to them in order to get rid of his own debt.

409
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:53,835
No way.

410
00:21:53,835 --> 00:21:56,335
I couldn't forgive him.

411
00:21:56,335 --> 00:21:58,235
I just couldn't forgive him.

412
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:31,435
Darn, I thought we were feasting today.

413
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:35,535
You mean, he fell asleep right after solving the case?

414
00:23:35,535 --> 00:23:37,835
Yes, fast asleep.

415
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:40,635
That's why he missed going to the party.

416
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:48,235
Ran! Give me another serving.

417
00:23:48,235 --> 00:23:53,435
Too bad you missed out on the feast, pops.

418
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:57,035
How cute!

419
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:00,635
You all right.

420
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:02,935
Shigeko was taken by a man.

421
00:24:02,935 --> 00:24:04,435
Taken?

422
00:24:04,435 --> 00:24:07,435
The culprit may have taken a fancy to her,

423
00:24:07,435 --> 00:24:11,635
but then he couldn't bottle up his desires anymore and took action.

424
00:24:11,635 --> 00:24:13,435
As I thought...

425
00:24:14,935 --> 00:24:16,435
A bird feather?

426
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:18,035
Why is it there?

427
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:20,635
Next Conan,

428
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:27,535
"Santa, My Companion"
