1
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:14,697
I'm really looking forward to the fireflies.

2
00:00:14,697 --> 00:00:16,397
I wish they'd hurry up and come.

3
00:00:16,397 --> 00:00:17,397
Yes.

4
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:22,597
"Michitake Owada (47)"

5
00:00:22,597 --> 00:00:24,797
Hello, Owada here.

6
00:00:24,797 --> 00:00:26,397
This is Nakamine speaking.

7
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:29,297
Nakamine, where are you right now?

8
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:31,997
The firefly song?

9
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:34,897
Because we're driving carefully,

10
00:00:34,897 --> 00:00:37,297
we might arrive later than planned.

11
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:39,597
But we've passed the Akazawa Bridge,

12
00:00:39,597 --> 00:00:41,997
and we'll be there in about 15 minutes.

13
00:00:41,997 --> 00:00:43,197
Is that so?

14
00:00:43,197 --> 00:00:46,597
Make sure you guys drive carefully.

15
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:48,097
"Tokurou Nakamine (28)" -I got it.

16
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:49,397
See you.

17
00:00:53,897 --> 00:00:55,897
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

18
00:00:55,897 --> 00:00:58,197
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

19
00:00:58,197 --> 00:01:00,197
Young people crash during a pepping up the village event.

20
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:02,497
The light of the fireflies shine light on the truth.

21
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:04,297
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,097
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:06,097 --> 00:01:08,097
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

24
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:53,818
"The Fireflies Shine Light on the Truth"

25
00:02:57,518 --> 00:03:00,218
He said he'll be here in 15 minutes.

26
00:03:02,218 --> 00:03:03,418
I want to see the fireflies quick.

27
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:05,118
It's almost time.

28
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,918
The fireflies serve as the trump card

29
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:08,518
of this village's sightseeing spot.

30
00:03:08,518 --> 00:03:10,918
All of the villagers are counting on them.

31
00:03:10,918 --> 00:03:14,418
The shrine used to gather tourists before.

32
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:15,918
Yes.

33
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:20,318
People were pretty crazy about the shrine

34
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:22,818
that's inside the cave.

35
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:27,418
That's why Priest Owada here came up with the idea of breeding fireflies,

36
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:30,318
but it was difficult to raise funds.

37
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,318
But you did manage to, right?

38
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:37,918
Yes. It's all thanks to the village head's son, Nakamine.

39
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,818
What about the matter regarding Aoi?

40
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:42,918
Well...

41
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:45,518
He said that in exchange for his fundraising service,

42
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:48,518
"Aoi Owada (22)" -he wants to marry my daughter Aoi.

43
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:50,718
And how did Aoi reply?

44
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:52,318
She gave him the cold shoulder.

45
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:53,418
Nakamine abuses

46
00:03:53,418 --> 00:03:55,718
"Tatsuma Kashiwa (26)" -the fact that he's the village head's son,

47
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:58,818
he beats people up and fools around with girls.

48
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:01,518
But since he's the youth group's leader,

49
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:04,318
he still helps us at times like this.

50
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:07,418
-Here it comes. -Here it comes.

51
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:08,918
Alright, let's go.

52
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:10,718
-Yes. -Let's go.

53
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:17,918
Hey, turn off the streetlight.

54
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:27,818
"Shuuichirou Tarumi (26)" -Tarumi,

55
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:29,318
thanks for the good work.

56
00:04:29,318 --> 00:04:30,318
No.

57
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:34,018
-Nakamine, I thank you too. -Tarumi, open it.

58
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:35,018
Right.

59
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:46,018
Awesome!

60
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:48,218
Pretty!

61
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:49,618
Amazing.

62
00:04:53,618 --> 00:04:55,118
Unlike the city,

63
00:04:55,118 --> 00:04:56,618
it's dark here so we can see clearly.

64
00:04:56,618 --> 00:04:57,618
Yes.

65
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:02,818
Alright. I'll catch you.

66
00:05:02,818 --> 00:05:03,918
Wait up...

67
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:05,618
Right here...

68
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:13,418
Where'd it go?

69
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,918
Where are you, firefly?

70
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:25,318
Did you know?

71
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:27,618
A firefly's mouth is undeveloped,

72
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,318
so it can only ingest water.

73
00:05:29,318 --> 00:05:32,018
Once the nutrient it stored during its larval form is used up,

74
00:05:32,018 --> 00:05:33,418
it dies.

75
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:40,718
"Officer Narutaki (59)"

76
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:44,218
Mr. Narutaki, so you're here.

77
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,418
Priest Owada?

78
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:49,018
How pretty they are.

79
00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:50,718
I couldn't help but think how nice it'd be

80
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:52,918
if I could show them to Maya.

81
00:05:57,118 --> 00:05:59,018
Is something wrong?

82
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:07,818
No, it's nothing.

83
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:13,418
How unfortunate.

84
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:16,318
A landslide struck his house last year.

85
00:06:16,318 --> 00:06:18,418
He lost his family because of that.

86
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:20,618
You mentioned that in the letter you sent.

87
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:24,218
About a man who lost his cute granddaughter because of that.

88
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,718
Yes, that was Mr. Narutaki.

89
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:29,218
He's a local police officer, right?

90
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:33,218
It really gave me the creeps, the road was narrow...

91
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:35,318
Where's Nakamine?

92
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:38,218
I want to thank him.

93
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:41,018
Where could he be?

94
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:42,518
Let me call him.

95
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:46,918
Hello?

96
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:49,318
Is this Nakamine? Where are you?

97
00:06:50,818 --> 00:06:52,018
What?

98
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:54,318
Hey, who's over there?

99
00:06:54,318 --> 00:06:56,718
What did Nakamine say?

100
00:06:56,718 --> 00:06:58,318
I don't know.

101
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,518
All he said was,

102
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:01,818
"I'm at Eboshi Rock, help me." in a painful voice.

103
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:04,118
-What? -Where's this Eboshi Rock?

104
00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:05,718
It's a rock upstream.

105
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:07,018
Let's take the truck.

106
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:08,018
Yes.

107
00:07:13,718 --> 00:07:15,418
What's up?

108
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:17,118
Well, you see...

109
00:07:17,118 --> 00:07:20,018
The key, I can't find the key.

110
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:22,218
Maybe Mr. Nakamine took it with him.

111
00:07:54,118 --> 00:07:55,718
Mr. Nakamine.

112
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:57,118
Mr. Nakamine, are you there?

113
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:00,418
How is he?

114
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:08,718
Smells like almond...

115
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:11,918
What? Don't tell me it's cyanide type poison?

116
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:13,118
Poison?

117
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,818
There's a drink bottle.

118
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:17,518
Was there poison in here?

119
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:20,718
Fireflies.

120
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:28,118
Let's organize the outline of the case

121
00:08:28,118 --> 00:08:31,218
before the guys from the precinct arrive here to back us up.

122
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:33,418
The whereabouts of Mr. Nakamine,

123
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:35,818
who came to deliver the fireflies for some reason became unknown.

124
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:37,918
When you, Mr. Tarumi placed a call to him using your cell phone,

125
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,018
he seemed to be struggling with something

126
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:41,618
and just saying, Eboshi Rock.

127
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:44,118
Someone seems to have been near him.

128
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:45,418
Yes, sir.

129
00:08:45,418 --> 00:08:47,918
You all rushed over to him

130
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:51,718
but found Mr. Nakmine dead in his own car.

131
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:56,218
But, I don't think Mr. Nakmine could drive.

132
00:08:56,218 --> 00:08:59,018
Because it seems that he broke his right leg.

133
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:01,418
In other words, after letting the fireflies go,

134
00:09:01,418 --> 00:09:04,818
he went to Eboshi Rock with someone who drove him there,

135
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:08,718
and was poisoned and killed.

136
00:09:08,718 --> 00:09:13,218
Did that firefly get in here when we got in the car?

137
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,318
Who're you people?

138
00:09:21,318 --> 00:09:23,618
We're members of the Youth Detective Squad.

139
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:25,618
We thought we'd help with the case.

140
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:27,918
Youth Detective Squad?

141
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:29,518
This is not for children.

142
00:09:29,518 --> 00:09:31,518
Hurry home and go to bed.

143
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:33,518
That's why I told you not to.

144
00:09:34,518 --> 00:09:35,718
Mayu.

145
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:38,818
Grandpa.

146
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:50,018
I'm sure that Mr. Narutaki recalled his grandchild.

147
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:52,018
Even I was surprised too.

148
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:56,118
A girl named Mayu who looked just like me died in a landslide?

149
00:09:56,118 --> 00:09:58,818
The mountains are becoming more prone to landslides.

150
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:00,918
I think too many trees have been cut.

151
00:10:00,918 --> 00:10:04,218
I always cold sweat when it starts to rain hard.

152
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:06,918
Father.

153
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:08,818
Aoi, come here for a while.

154
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:13,418
Where were you after the fireflies were released?

155
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:14,618
Where?

156
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:19,318
I don't think so, but were you seeing Mr. Nakamine?

157
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,618
I wasn't.

158
00:10:20,618 --> 00:10:22,418
It's that guy after all,

159
00:10:22,418 --> 00:10:25,118
so I was worried about what he might do.

160
00:10:25,118 --> 00:10:27,218
Did you hear about Mr. Kashiwa...

161
00:10:27,218 --> 00:10:28,418
I'm telling you, that's not it.

162
00:10:28,418 --> 00:10:29,618
What's not it?

163
00:10:31,818 --> 00:10:33,818
Well, what about Mr. Kashiwagi?

164
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:37,018
According to Tarumi,

165
00:10:37,018 --> 00:10:39,018
he was really given a bad time.

166
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:41,618
Tatsuma,

167
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:43,618
if your late father finds out that the number one elite

168
00:10:43,618 --> 00:10:46,718
of the village got stingy about donating,

169
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:48,818
his heart would grieve.

170
00:10:48,818 --> 00:10:50,218
Talk softer.

171
00:10:50,218 --> 00:10:51,818
They'll hear you.

172
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,918
This is how loud I normally talk.

173
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:56,318
If the Kashiwagi family is going to go out of their way to help me,

174
00:10:56,318 --> 00:10:59,518
it'll make it easier for me to talk to the villagers.

175
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:00,718
Am I right, Tarumi?

176
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:02,018
True.

177
00:11:02,018 --> 00:11:04,018
So, you're all it takes to get the people

178
00:11:04,018 --> 00:11:06,618
to start an event to pep up the village.

179
00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:08,318
My, my...

180
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:10,118
You're the village head's son.

181
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:12,118
Long time no see.

182
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:14,918
It's been so long, Mrs. Kashiwagi.

183
00:11:14,918 --> 00:11:17,518
My, it sure has been a long time.

184
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:19,518
I wonder what he wants.

185
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:22,418
Tatsuma, hurry and invite him in.

186
00:11:23,718 --> 00:11:26,518
It seems he was bawled out by his mother later.

187
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:29,318
Saying why doesn't he help with the village revitalisation.

188
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:31,818
She doesn't know

189
00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:35,818
that the estate her husband left behind is on the verge of bankruptcy.

190
00:11:37,518 --> 00:11:39,018
I'll tell you again,

191
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:40,918
I don't care if you're childhood friends,

192
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:44,218
I'm against you marrying Mr. Kashiwagi.

193
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:45,618
With a house on the verge of bankruptcy

194
00:11:45,618 --> 00:11:47,218
and a mother whose coming along,

195
00:11:47,218 --> 00:11:49,318
I know how tough it will be for you.

196
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,318
Watch your step because it's slippery.

197
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:01,618
Okay.

198
00:12:01,618 --> 00:12:04,118
It's really strange that there's a shrine inside a cave.

199
00:12:04,118 --> 00:12:05,318
I wonder if there aren't any fireflies here?

200
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:08,018
Fireflies come this way.

201
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,718
"Come, come, come, fireflies..."

202
00:12:11,718 --> 00:12:15,718
Come to think of it, back then I heard the firefly song.

203
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:21,418
Hello, Owada here.

204
00:12:21,418 --> 00:12:23,118
This is Nakamine speaking.

205
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:26,318
Nakamine, where are you right now?

206
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:30,318
Go for it, Youth Detective Squad!

207
00:12:30,318 --> 00:12:32,818
The police detective is going to scold you again.

208
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,918
He's not here, so I'll be fine.

209
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:37,518
He's at the shrine office outside.

210
00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:39,518
Support from the precinct has arrived

211
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:42,018
and a formal investigation has begun.

212
00:12:42,018 --> 00:12:44,618
Did you find something new?

213
00:12:45,718 --> 00:12:47,218
As for the drink bottle,

214
00:12:47,218 --> 00:12:51,418
it seems to have been Mr. Nakamine's favourite drink.

215
00:12:51,418 --> 00:12:52,918
The inside of the bottle that was left behind

216
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:55,418
seems to have been washed thoroughly.

217
00:12:56,718 --> 00:12:58,318
It was washed?

218
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:01,518
Aoi, you're there, aren't you?

219
00:13:01,518 --> 00:13:04,318
You can make contact with the shrine office with that.

220
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:08,318
Aoi, a person from the police wants to see you.

221
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:21,818
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

222
00:13:26,818 --> 00:13:28,618
The fact is...

223
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:31,618
We've been asking around from last night to all day today

224
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:33,318
and have come up with an unfortunate result.

225
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:34,818
What's this?

226
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:37,518
The chief priest forgot to turn the microphone off.

227
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:39,618
After the fireflies were released,

228
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:43,818
no one has seen Aoi for 30 minutes.

229
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:44,818
In other words,

230
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:48,818
she wasn't seen till the time the body of the victim was found.

231
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:51,618
But, Mr. Narutaki, it comes as no surprised

232
00:13:51,618 --> 00:13:55,418
that no one saw my daughter in some place dark like that, does it?

233
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,218
However, when we checked,

234
00:13:57,218 --> 00:14:01,018
everyone acknowledged the presence of everyone else.

235
00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:02,618
Because we bring our faces close together

236
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:04,918
when watching the fireflies.

237
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:06,918
I mean, we've only got very little space.

238
00:14:07,918 --> 00:14:10,618
The only people none of us saw are

239
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:13,518
Ms. Aoi Owada and one more person.

240
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:16,018
The same goes for me too.

241
00:14:16,018 --> 00:14:19,218
Mr. Nakamine was all for Aoi,

242
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:20,418
so if she asked him to come

243
00:14:20,418 --> 00:14:23,518
he would go without any doubts to Eboshi Rock with her.

244
00:14:23,518 --> 00:14:26,118
And if she gave him the poisoned drink there.

245
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:29,118
It would apply to me too, then.

246
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:33,918
But, I don't think Mr. Nakamine would open his heart to you.

247
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:37,218
Either way, I'm in safe zone.

248
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:38,518
Thank god.

249
00:14:38,518 --> 00:14:41,618
Not too fast.

250
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:44,618
You're still a suspect.

251
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:47,318
I hear Mr. Nakamine was angry

252
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:51,018
that you stole the money for catching the fireflies.

253
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:52,618
No... That's not true at all.

254
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:54,018
It was a misunderstanding.

255
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,318
I explained everything and Nakamine understood.

256
00:14:56,318 --> 00:14:59,518
Genta, where did you get that flashlight?

257
00:15:00,518 --> 00:15:03,118
You had it with you since last night, right?

258
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:05,818
I forgot to return it...

259
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:09,118
It was in the truck that brought the fireflies.

260
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,618
Will you show that to me?

261
00:15:12,618 --> 00:15:14,018
Why?

262
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:15,918
If I remember correctly, back then...

263
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:20,618
-Nakamine, I thank you too. -Tarumi, open it.

264
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:25,018
I see. That's the story.

265
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:30,319
Aoi, do you have anything to say?

266
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,319
You do have something to say.

267
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,519
Mr. Agasa.

268
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,719
Don't worry, Mr. Owada, your daughter is not the culprit.

269
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:47,019
Amateurs keep out of this.

270
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:48,519
It'll be over soon.

271
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:53,219
So long as you disclose the crime that Mr. Tarumi committed.

272
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,919
What's this about the crime I committed?

273
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,419
You're the one, aren't you?

274
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:00,819
The one who killed Mr. Nakamine with the poisoned drink?

275
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:02,819
Cut out the joke please.

276
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:06,819
When Mr. Nakamine died, I was with all of you, right?

277
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:10,019
You put on an act saying that Mr. Nakamine died

278
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,619
while you were on the phone with him,

279
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:14,819
because Mr. Nakamine was already dead at that time.

280
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:16,019
What?

281
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:17,919
Wait a second.

282
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,619
I was with my friends all the while

283
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:22,119
after releasing the fireflies.

284
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:24,819
Just when did I ever go to Eboshi Rock?

285
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:27,819
Before you released the fireflies.

286
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:30,219
You received a call from Mr. Nakamine

287
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:32,819
while on your way to delivering the fireflies

288
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:35,419
but didn't you hear the melody of the firefly song

289
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:37,019
from the telephone then?

290
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,219
That's right.

291
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:42,119
It was a tune that came from the 1cent candy store

292
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:44,619
on the way to Eboshi Rock.

293
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,919
In other words, back then,

294
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,419
Mr. Nakamine was in the truck that Mr. Tarumi was driving

295
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:54,619
and heading towards Eboshi Rock.

296
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:57,519
He let Mr. Nakamine off at Eboshi Rock,

297
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,319
and came to the riverside alone.

298
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,019
That can't be

299
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:06,519
because we heard Mr. Nakamine's voice when the fireflies were released.

300
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:09,619
That was just a simple trick.

301
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,319
This is what he used.

302
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:16,719
What? It's just a flashlight.

303
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,819
In fact, this is...

304
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,119
Hey, turn off the streetlight.

305
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,219
This is...

306
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:27,319
Tarumi, open it.

307
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:32,419
This is a flashlight type voice recorder.

308
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,019
You used this to make it look like

309
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,519
you were conversing with Mr. Nakamine, weren't you?

310
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:41,619
I see, that's why he didn't answer when I called him.

311
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:43,319
Exactly.

312
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:48,219
Mr. Tarumi, when you were heading for Eboshi Rock with the truck

313
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:52,119
you looked inside the truck and seemed strangely flustered.

314
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,919
That's because you couldn't find this,

315
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,919
that was supposed to be in the truck.

316
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,819
The fact is that one of the children inadvertently took it.

317
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:05,119
You probably said the following to Mr. Nakamine.

318
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,119
Aoi wants to see you,

319
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,419
but she doesn't want her father to find out about this.

320
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:12,219
Therefore, you told him to establish an alibi

321
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:15,319
and sneak over to Eboshi Rock.

322
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:17,919
Mr. Nakamine was completely deceived.

323
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,719
He had you take him to Eboshi Rock,

324
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:22,719
and recorded his own voice in the voice recorder,

325
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:24,719
to use it to establish his alibi.

326
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:28,119
Then he waited for Aoi in his own car

327
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:30,219
that he had taken to Eboshi Rock beforehand.

328
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:34,119
You then, handed him the poisoned drink.

329
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:41,019
He drank the drink while waiting for Aoi, and died.

330
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,419
Nonsense!

331
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:45,219
If I went to Eboshi Rock before releasing the fireflies,

332
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:48,619
why were fireflies flying around in the car?

333
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:50,619
Just because you wanted to say this,

334
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:54,119
you released the firefly in the car.

335
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,119
When and how?

336
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:58,819
Very audacious indeed.

337
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:04,019
You got to the victim's car just a bit earlier than me.

338
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,219
That's when you switched

339
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:07,919
the bottle with the poison in it

340
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,619
to the one with firefly inside it.

341
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,119
The bottle was washed thoroughly

342
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,519
to put firefly inside it.

343
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,219
Let's hear you out at the station.

344
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:28,719
Aoi!

345
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,019
Mr. Tatsuma!

346
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:40,019
-Ai! -Mayu!

347
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:41,519
Ai!

348
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:49,619
What's that sound?

349
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:52,819
It's a landslide.

350
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:08,519
Are you all alright?

351
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:13,019
Yes.

352
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:15,119
-We're fine. -Where's Ai?

353
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,719
Over here.

354
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,719
Darn.

355
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,919
Tarumi!

356
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,319
Cut out doing stupid things.

357
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,919
You have nowhere to escape.

358
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:25,919
Shut up.

359
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,519
-Mayu! -Ai!

360
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,519
What?

361
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:33,119
Fireflies, fireflies!

362
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,819
Who cares about fireflies?

363
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:36,219
I wouldn't say that.

364
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:38,019
Fireflies in here are just proof

365
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:40,619
that there's a way out of here, right?

366
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:42,119
I see.

367
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,119
Okay, this side.

368
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,219
-Mayu. -Hey.

369
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:51,619
If you move, this kid dies.

370
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:55,019
There're two fireflies now.

371
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:56,719
No.

372
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:59,219
It's just the reflection in the water of the puddle.

373
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:01,019
I'm sure Ai noticed it.

374
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:11,619
You brat.

375
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:12,719
Mayu!

376
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:17,119
Darn.

377
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,619
We did it.

378
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:36,919
Are you okay, Mayu?

379
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:38,419
Mayu!

380
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:41,219
I'm not Mayu.

381
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,519
But, thank you.

382
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,219
I'm glad.

383
00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:54,719
I'm really glad.

384
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:22,819
Tarumi's motive for murder

385
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,719
was not only because he used the money that was to be used for fireflies,

386
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:27,919
but also because he was embezzling money

387
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,019
from Mr. Nakamine's father's company,

388
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:31,619
and because what he was doing was about to come to light.

389
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,019
I was worried about how things would turn out at one point,

390
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:36,719
but all that ends well is well.

391
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:38,519
You can say that again.

392
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:47,919
They seem to be doing good too.

393
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,019
I guess so.

394
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:57,519
A purse snatcher?

395
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,619
I said hold it!

396
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,419
Someone you knew?

397
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:08,019
I'm sure he had a burn mark on his right eye.

398
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:11,119
I don't remember a guy like that during the bus-jack.

399
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:13,719
During the bus-jack he didn't have a burn.

400
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,319
I think he was wearing a black knitted cap

401
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:17,819
and a mask over his mouth.

402
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:19,619
What?

403
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:21,019
Next Conan,

404
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:27,919
