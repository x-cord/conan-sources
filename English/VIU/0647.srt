1
00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:02,373
After accepting Sonoko's invitation,

2
00:00:02,373 --> 00:00:06,373
Ran and I headed toward Haido Hotel for a cake buffet.

3
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:10,473
We encountered a Jeet Kune Do user on the bus en route.

4
00:00:10,473 --> 00:00:12,173
With combative skills that evenly matched Ran's,

5
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:14,473
who is this person?

6
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,773
At Haido Hotel, the fact that the cake buffet offer

7
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:21,673
already came to an end disappointed Ran and Sonoko.

8
00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:24,173
Then came a resounding scream.

9
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:26,173
A man had fallen to his death

10
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:29,473
at the parking lot behind the hotel annex.

11
00:00:29,473 --> 00:00:32,473
Toshiko Hirukawa, a housewife who happened to be there,

12
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:34,673
said she saw someone on the roof,

13
00:00:34,673 --> 00:00:37,273
so we rushed there as fast as we could.

14
00:00:37,273 --> 00:00:39,573
However, all we saw on the roof

15
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:42,773
were men's shoes and clothes.

16
00:00:42,773 --> 00:00:44,873
Was this a suicide?

17
00:00:44,873 --> 00:00:49,473
No, this was a murder disguised as a suicide.

18
00:00:49,473 --> 00:00:52,173
One more person saw through the disguise.

19
00:00:52,173 --> 00:00:54,873
It was the Jeet Kune Do user from earlier, Sera.

20
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:57,373
That wannabe claimed to be a detective.

21
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:01,573
The man who fell to his death was Teigo Uesumi.

22
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:03,073
He caused a public uproar

23
00:01:03,073 --> 00:01:04,973
for being the ringleader of a remittance scam.

24
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:08,973
And Hirukawa's group was victims from that scam.

25
00:01:10,673 --> 00:01:12,873
In the hotel annex where Uesumi was hiding,

26
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,873
rumors regarding an old man's ghost on a wheelchair

27
00:01:14,873 --> 00:01:16,273
were flying about.

28
00:01:16,273 --> 00:01:20,173
Apparently, Hirukwa's father who had been using the wheelchair

29
00:01:20,173 --> 00:01:21,373
lost hope at the news of his wife's death

30
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,873
due to her suffering from the scam.

31
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:26,673
And committed suicide in this hotel annex.

32
00:01:26,673 --> 00:01:31,473
Don't tell me, Uesumi was pushed off by a ghost?

33
00:01:31,473 --> 00:01:33,173
Or was it...

34
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:54,073
If all cases were men,

35
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,873
all hidden mysteries are women.

36
00:01:55,873 --> 00:01:57,873
The truth behind the ghost will betray any expectations.

37
00:01:57,873 --> 00:01:59,873
And the identity of Sera, our new detective is...

38
00:01:59,873 --> 00:02:01,373
He sees through the one and only truth.

39
00:02:01,373 --> 00:02:03,173
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

40
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:05,873
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

41
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:34,088
"Deduction Showdown at the Haunted Hotel (Part 2)"

42
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:41,183
This graffiti certainly is terrible.

43
00:03:41,183 --> 00:03:44,583
No choice but to renovate, huh?

44
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,983
Officer Chiba!

45
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:47,783
You found anyone?

46
00:03:47,783 --> 00:03:49,283
No, not yet.

47
00:03:49,283 --> 00:03:52,583
Oh? Why is there a wheelchair here?

48
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,483
I don't know.

49
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:57,083
When I found it, it was still moving.

50
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,783
It was moving?

51
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:00,983
Since there was weird fishing line

52
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:03,283
attached between the wheels,

53
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:05,183
I checked with the hotel.

54
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:07,283
They said this was the electric wheelchair

55
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:10,083
that the fallen Uesumi had been borrowing.

56
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,583
So did he have bad legs?

57
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:17,883
No, it seems that he was just using it to cruise around the annex.

58
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:21,083
What an unbelievable guy.

59
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,583
It's possible that Uesumi was the one

60
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,283
behind the aforementioned ghost commotion.

61
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:29,583
If he had planned to scare the three victims

62
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,383
who came to visit on 2F where the elderly man committed suicide,

63
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,783
by manipulating the unoccupied wheelchair with a fishing line,

64
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:37,583
if we think of it this way...

65
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:41,583
That would certainly make sense.

66
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:45,283
Even so, this fishing line is extremely long.

67
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:49,283
And there are some broken rubber bands at the tip of this.

68
00:04:49,283 --> 00:04:50,883
The footrests have marks

69
00:04:50,883 --> 00:04:53,783
indicating they've bumped into something.

70
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:57,983
Say, Inspector, couldn't the culprit have used this?

71
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,483
Take a look out the window.

72
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:04,683
This is the opposite side from the parking lot where Uesumi fell.

73
00:05:04,683 --> 00:05:07,983
They couldn't have accomplished anything even with the wheelchair.

74
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:10,083
Why is Conan with us?

75
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,583
Conan was among the ones who came to the annex

76
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:17,483
after the incident, so I brought him along just in case.

77
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,183
Looks like there's an unfamiliar man in the mix.

78
00:05:20,183 --> 00:05:22,583
Yeah, a detective it seems.

79
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:26,783
A detective, huh?

80
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:31,383
Could it have been your misunderstanding?

81
00:05:31,383 --> 00:05:34,883
Regarding this elevator stopping on the second and sixth floor?

82
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:38,883
If you think I'm lying, ask the guard and find out.

83
00:05:38,883 --> 00:05:40,783
Because we both saw it

84
00:05:40,783 --> 00:05:42,883
when I asked him to keep watch on the elevator.

85
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,283
So the doors on this side open too?

86
00:05:52,283 --> 00:05:56,383
Yeah! This elevator has both front and rear doors!

87
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:58,283
When I asked the hotel staff,

88
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:00,983
they said that this side of the annex's 1F and 2F

89
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:03,783
were made into a Grand Hall used for occasions like weddings.

90
00:06:03,783 --> 00:06:05,283
And that by making the elevator entrance and exit

91
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:07,083
on the opposite side, it was more convenient

92
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:11,883
and freed up more space, so that's why!

93
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:16,083
Still, it seems that the graffiti here is even more obnoxious.

94
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,383
Yes.

95
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:21,283
Since this apparently was the floor Uesumi had been staying on.

96
00:06:21,283 --> 00:06:23,583
By the way, the renovation workers

97
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,683
had been scheduled to come in one hour

98
00:06:25,683 --> 00:06:27,883
after the time of Uesumi's fall.

99
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:29,283
So this is it...

100
00:06:29,283 --> 00:06:32,283
The window Uesumi broke using the fire extinguisher.

101
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:33,683
Looks like it.

102
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:36,283
Hey, that's dangerous!

103
00:06:36,283 --> 00:06:38,183
The sticky tape on the sheets that had been covering it

104
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:41,183
has been blown through by the wind.

105
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:43,183
But, this place is...

106
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:46,283
it's directly above the place where he fell, right?

107
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:48,483
Don't you think this means something?

108
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,683
On the border between the wall under the window and the floor,

109
00:06:54,683 --> 00:06:56,583
there's a lot of paint.

110
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:59,383
What's more...

111
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:03,283
It's entirely dried up.

112
00:07:03,283 --> 00:07:04,383
And these marks seem to indicate

113
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,083
something had been placed a top the paint.

114
00:07:11,283 --> 00:07:13,783
This paint can, perhaps?

115
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:17,183
There's a dent on it caused by collision.

116
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:20,683
And there's one more paint can with the same condition.

117
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:23,283
As far as having marks from having bumped into something,

118
00:07:23,283 --> 00:07:27,683
the bottom parts of those elevator doors have them too.

119
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:31,183
Hold on, hold on.

120
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:34,583
An elevator with both front and rear doors.

121
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,883
An electric wheelchair with fishing line attached.

122
00:07:37,883 --> 00:07:39,583
Rumors of ghosts.

123
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:44,383
And this suspicious renovation scene.

124
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,083
I see, so that's how it was!

125
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,783
No doubt the culprit was the only one

126
00:07:48,783 --> 00:07:50,383
to have entered the annex before the incident.

127
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:53,983
It was that lady named Hirukawa, our culprit!

128
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:55,683
What?

129
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:59,083
If you would set things up per my instructions now,

130
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,683
and bring Mrs. Hirukawa over here?

131
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,883
You said the case is solved.

132
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:17,283
So then you've realized that he committed suicide after all?

133
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:18,983
No.

134
00:08:18,983 --> 00:08:23,283
Teigo Uesumi's jumper suicide was a trick.

135
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:26,183
And that's why we deliberately had you come to this 6F

136
00:08:26,183 --> 00:08:27,583
via the elevator

137
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,183
which was out of service at the time of crime.

138
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:32,383
Because the culprit used the elevator

139
00:08:32,383 --> 00:08:34,483
in order to disguise it as a suicide.

140
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:35,983
Or so he says.

141
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,983
He? I'm...

142
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:39,483
You're Sera, right?

143
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:42,083
-Oh, I mean... -Anyway...

144
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,683
Can you tell us?

145
00:08:43,683 --> 00:08:45,783
Your deduction, Sera?

146
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:47,583
We'll listen and let you know

147
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,583
if there are any erroneous parts.

148
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,783
Well, all right, you d better watch and learn.

149
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,483
Because the trick I'm going to speak of

150
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:57,783
will be put it into practice right here!

151
00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:01,383
But, why right here?

152
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:06,083
Even if it was a murder, didn't he fall from the roof?

153
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,883
I've said this before,

154
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:11,283
but Uesumi's jacket and shoes found on the roof

155
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:13,483
were placed beforehand in order to make this incident

156
00:09:13,483 --> 00:09:16,083
look like a jumper suicide.

157
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,683
They were fakes planted there

158
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,283
so that we wouldn't know the actual crime scene was here

159
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:21,883
on the 6F of the annex.

160
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:23,383
Mrs. Hirakawa.

161
00:09:23,383 --> 00:09:26,683
You did that in order to hide the fact that you used

162
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:31,183
the elevator and wheelchair to fling Uesumi out from here!

163
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:34,683
Hold on a minute!

164
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:36,983
When he fell from above,

165
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:40,383
Mrs. Hirukawa was inside the car in the parking lot

166
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:43,083
with the two of us!

167
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,483
That's right.

168
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,283
So tell me,

169
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:49,683
how could I have controlled the wheelchair and the elevator?

170
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:51,083
Sure thing!

171
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,183
Once you pressed the buttons on the elevator beforehand,

172
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:54,883
you didn't need to stay there

173
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:58,583
to be able to transport Uesumi in the electric wheelchair

174
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,183
from 2F to 6F, drop him,

175
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:05,283
and then return the wheelchair to 2F.

176
00:10:05,283 --> 00:10:07,383
Although, you did need to have prepared

177
00:10:07,383 --> 00:10:11,783
a long fishing line with several rubber bands attached to one end.

178
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:13,583
Fishing line and rubber bands?

179
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:17,483
Well, why don't we hear it from you then?

180
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,983
How one could automatically cause someone to fall to their death

181
00:10:20,983 --> 00:10:23,983
with this witchcraft-like trick?

182
00:10:23,983 --> 00:10:25,083
Well...

183
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:39,983
First, you met with Uesumi who was staying on this sixth floor

184
00:10:39,983 --> 00:10:42,983
and fed him alcohol until he was inebriated.

185
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:46,483
Next, you set the completely smashed Uesumi up

186
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:48,883
in the wheelchair he borrowed,

187
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:51,383
in a way that he was hugging his knees,

188
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:53,383
and brought him in front of the elevator

189
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:54,983
while opening the door.

190
00:10:54,983 --> 00:10:57,883
So that you could wrap the rubber bands

191
00:10:57,883 --> 00:10:59,783
attached to the long fishing line around the mirror

192
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:02,383
near the elevator's ceiling.

193
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:04,583
Then, you pushed the button for the first floor

194
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:08,683
from outside the elevator to send the empty cab down,

195
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:09,983
so that you could measure

196
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:11,983
the length of the line between 1F and 6F.

197
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:14,483
You then brought the elevator back up to 6F

198
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:18,183
and at a length about 30cm shorter than measured.

199
00:11:18,183 --> 00:11:19,783
You tied the fishing line

200
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:21,383
in between the front wheels of the chair,

201
00:11:21,383 --> 00:11:22,883
so that your trick could start!

202
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,483
After reeling the fishing line in

203
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:28,283
so that it wouldn't catch on anything,

204
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:31,983
you rode the elevator with Uesumi on the wheelchair.

205
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,783
On the second floor, you pushed the wheelchair out the elevator

206
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:39,083
and steered the wheelchair toward the elevator doors.

207
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,583
You then closed the doors and descended to 1F.

208
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:47,183
The one who ran into Mrs. Hirukawa

209
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:50,983
as she got off on 1F was this little boy.

210
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:52,583
It seems you told him,

211
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,183
"This one is for the annex, so don't get on" or something.

212
00:11:55,183 --> 00:11:59,583
But that was to prevent the little boy from using the elevator.

213
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,883
Because if he did, the fact that

214
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:03,583
a weird line was dangling down from the mirror

215
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,983
above the elevator doors.

216
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:07,183
And that the other end of the line

217
00:12:07,183 --> 00:12:10,683
passed out through the opposite doors would be exposed.

218
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:15,483
Plus, the fact that the buttons for 2F and 6F had been pushed

219
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:18,383
would have become an obvious clue.

220
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:21,183
The second and sixth floors?

221
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:23,783
Well, "Seeing is believing".

222
00:12:23,783 --> 00:12:25,583
Let's go ahead and reenact it!

223
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,083
Ready, Inspector?

224
00:12:27,983 --> 00:12:29,883
Officer Chiba, are you ready?

225
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:30,983
Yes, sir!

226
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:34,283
I've pressed the buttons for 2F and 6F on the elevator.

227
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:36,083
I'm sending it up now!

228
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:41,883
As the elevator reaches the second floor,

229
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:43,783
what's waiting for it is...

230
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:47,083
The electric wheelchair, which is still moving forward

231
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,983
while being blocked by the doors.

232
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:51,783
When those doors open, it'll go inside the elevator

233
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:55,183
and keep going straight into the doors on the opposite side.

234
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:56,683
As you already know,

235
00:12:56,683 --> 00:13:00,383
this elevator has both front and rear doors.

236
00:13:00,383 --> 00:13:02,683
The doors that open on 2F

237
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:06,083
are on the opposite side as those that open on 6F.

238
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,483
Which means the wheelchair that entered on the 2F

239
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:13,083
will automatically come straight out when it reaches this 6F.

240
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:17,983
Afterwards, if you use the paint cans and cardboard boxes

241
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:22,883
placed around the elevator to guide the wheelchair's path...

242
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:24,783
The wheelchair will keep going in a straight line

243
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,183
parallel to the wall.

244
00:13:26,183 --> 00:13:28,783
Toward the glass window that Uesumi had broken,

245
00:13:28,783 --> 00:13:31,183
hit the wall below it, and...

246
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,683
What?

247
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,183
Hey, what's the meaning of this?

248
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:41,283
No, no way!

249
00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:42,683
The reactive force from hitting the wall

250
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:45,383
should have already sent the dummy flying out!

251
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:48,883
Perhaps, when the wheelchair headed back to the second floor,

252
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:50,283
the force of the turn threw him out...

253
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:53,283
But, according to your previous deduction,

254
00:13:53,283 --> 00:13:56,483
you said the culprit only returned the wheelchair to the second floor

255
00:13:56,483 --> 00:13:58,583
after Uesumi had fallen.

256
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,383
Did I say that?

257
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:04,283
Don't tell me this wannabe truly didn't figure it out?

258
00:14:04,283 --> 00:14:05,883
But I'm in a bind.

259
00:14:05,883 --> 00:14:07,783
It's too abrupt to call Sonoko now

260
00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:09,983
and put her to sleep for my deduction.

261
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,983
And making Inspector Megure or Detective Takagi

262
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:14,883
the target of my tranquilizer watch

263
00:14:14,883 --> 00:14:17,883
will create problems down the road.

264
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:19,583
The only one who can appear here unannounced

265
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,383
and yet convincingly shine light on the truth...

266
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:24,683
And later be able to explain away their involvement,

267
00:14:24,683 --> 00:14:26,783
is none other than...

268
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,383
I got it!

269
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:30,183
She used her car!

270
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:32,483
She tied Uesumi, who was brought here by the wheelchair,

271
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:35,683
to her car with a fishing line and backed it up...

272
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:36,683
Sorry to say,

273
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:39,183
but we didn't find any sort of device or trick at all

274
00:14:39,183 --> 00:14:40,783
on Mrs. Hirukawa's car.

275
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:44,883
And frankly, if she had tied Uesumi to her car using the line,

276
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,983
she could've just left him sleeping near the window

277
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:49,983
instead of moving him with the wheelchair, no?

278
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,083
You have a point.

279
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,383
Look what I've done.

280
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:57,483
I was too careless.

281
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:02,583
Indeed, an interesting trick it was.

282
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,183
But it was just an empty theory.

283
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:08,683
I'm disappointed in you, police officers.

284
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:12,083
To think you'd take a whipper-snapper's fantasy as truth.

285
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,083
It was the paint cans.

286
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,783
The culprit used the two paint cans near the window

287
00:15:20,783 --> 00:15:23,883
in order to toss the victim out the window.

288
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:26,483
-The... -The voice... is that Kudo?

289
00:15:26,483 --> 00:15:28,183
That's right!

290
00:15:29,283 --> 00:15:32,583
Once I told Shinichi about the case over the phone,

291
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,783
he said he figured it out!

292
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:37,383
Shinichi Kudo?

293
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,418
Shinichi Kudo?

294
00:15:45,418 --> 00:15:47,118
And then?

295
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:49,518
How exactly were the paint cans used?

296
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:52,818
Kudo?

297
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,618
There is a huge stain

298
00:15:54,618 --> 00:15:57,418
from spilled paint beneath the window, right?

299
00:15:57,418 --> 00:16:00,118
And some marks indicating something had been put there.

300
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:02,718
So please set the paint cans on their side

301
00:16:02,718 --> 00:16:05,018
and align them with those marks.

302
00:16:06,618 --> 00:16:09,318
Do they match up perfectly?

303
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,218
Both of them match up exactly!

304
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:14,818
Then please hold those two cans in place

305
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:16,518
from either side with your feet.

306
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,518
Pull the wheelchair away from the window

307
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:21,118
and set it in motion once more!

308
00:16:22,418 --> 00:16:24,718
Well, the wheelchair...

309
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,018
All right, I'll handle this.

310
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:31,918
Will it work if I start from around here, Kudo?

311
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:33,618
Around here?

312
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,218
I'm not at the crime scene,

313
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:37,018
so there's no way I could ascertain that.

314
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:39,418
I suppose so, huh.

315
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:42,118
All right, I'll let 'er rip!

316
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:45,418
The wheelchair Uesumi had been placed

317
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:47,318
in exited the elevator on 6F

318
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:49,418
and headed toward the window.

319
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:51,718
And when the footrests hit the paint cans

320
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:54,118
that had been glued against the wall by paint.

321
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:03,918
The footrests would slip under the cans

322
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:06,018
tilting the wheelchair forward.

323
00:17:06,018 --> 00:17:08,218
The armrests would then hit the wall,

324
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:12,018
sending the victim flying due to recoil.

325
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:15,818
And the culprit having confirmed the victim's fall with her own eyes.

326
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:18,118
Made up an excuse to go up the roof

327
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:20,618
by mentioning a suspicious figure

328
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:23,118
and brought the elevator down from the sixth floor

329
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:25,118
to the first floor.

330
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:28,918
Chiba, call the elevator down to 1F.

331
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:30,218
Roger that.

332
00:17:36,018 --> 00:17:38,818
Doing so pulled on the fishing line

333
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:41,218
that had been attached to the wheels.

334
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:43,718
The wheelchair did an about-face

335
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:47,418
and moved toward the elevator

336
00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:49,818
and crashed into the elevator doors!

337
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,718
As the fishing line that was 30cm shy

338
00:17:51,718 --> 00:17:53,518
kept being pulled down...

339
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:55,418
The rubber bands wrapped around the elevator mirror

340
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:57,418
stretched to the fullest.

341
00:17:57,418 --> 00:17:58,718
And snapped!

342
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:02,818
That's how, when the culprit got on to the elevator,

343
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:07,518
nothing was left inside of it!

344
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:10,718
Afterwards, when the elevator reached the rooftop,

345
00:18:10,718 --> 00:18:13,318
she made up some reason.

346
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:16,018
What are you doing, Mrs. Hirukawa?

347
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:18,618
Can't I just stay here?

348
00:18:18,618 --> 00:18:20,118
I'm scared.

349
00:18:20,118 --> 00:18:21,618
No way!

350
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:26,018
You're the one who saw them, Mrs. Hirukawa!

351
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:30,018
And she only had to push the 6F and 2F buttons before she left.

352
00:18:31,718 --> 00:18:34,818
Having done so, the elevator would bring the wheelchair

353
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:40,218
from 6F down to 2F in the same manner as before.

354
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:42,618
Even if the police found it later...

355
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:44,818
They would only see it as a random wheelchair

356
00:18:44,818 --> 00:18:47,218
that was still running for some reason,

357
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:49,118
away from the crime scene.

358
00:18:50,218 --> 00:18:53,018
Incidentally, the reason why the paint cans were not stuck to the wall

359
00:18:53,018 --> 00:18:57,018
under the window when Conan got there was...

360
00:18:57,018 --> 00:18:58,918
because the collision from the footrests

361
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:00,818
knocked them loose from the wall.

362
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:02,718
And when the wheelchair turned around,

363
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:05,418
the force bumped them off.

364
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:08,318
At any rate, if you find fibers from the clothes the victim was wearing

365
00:19:08,318 --> 00:19:11,018
on the clothes the culprit has on,

366
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:13,018
it'd be decisive.

367
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,518
Since, in order for a woman to put a grown man in a wheelchair

368
00:19:16,518 --> 00:19:20,918
she had to have held his body tightly against her.

369
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:23,218
Of course, if you testify that the man

370
00:19:23,218 --> 00:19:25,818
whom you saw as the remittance scam ringleader...

371
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:28,518
And you, the surviving family member of his victim,

372
00:19:28,518 --> 00:19:31,518
had hugged in joy after reconciling...

373
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:33,918
That'll be a different story.

374
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:38,518
If I had to commit that sort of nausea-inducing perjury,

375
00:19:38,518 --> 00:19:40,718
I'd rather just confess to everything!

376
00:19:40,718 --> 00:19:44,218
That I was the one who put that man in the wheelchair,

377
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:48,218
And wheeled him straight into hell!

378
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:51,518
Then, could it be that the haunting rumors

379
00:19:51,518 --> 00:19:54,918
were the result of your having tested this trick out repeatedly?

380
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:56,418
No.

381
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:59,518
I only came up with the idea of setting the paint cans

382
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:02,918
under the window that man broke.

383
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:06,318
The one who tested it out repeatedly wasn't me.

384
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:10,918
Before, when I had gone to that man's room to call on him...

385
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,718
It was that man who showed me...

386
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:16,718
An unoccupied wheelchair

387
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:20,718
coming out from an empty elevator.

388
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:25,218
Don't tell me, the victim came up with the trick himself?

389
00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:29,018
Yeah. That man, as he was laughing

390
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:33,218
and ending the call with his friend who had sent the elevator up, said...

391
00:20:33,218 --> 00:20:35,818
It was a plan to drive out all the pesky media

392
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,718
and hotel annex guests,

393
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:41,018
dubbed "Operation Old Geezer's Ghost"!

394
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:44,918
That's why I had him sit in the wheelchair

395
00:20:44,918 --> 00:20:48,518
in order to make that man understand

396
00:20:48,518 --> 00:20:51,618
how my father had kept begging for his apologies

397
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,918
even while riding in a wheelchair.

398
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:56,918
That heartrending feeling of his...

399
00:21:03,718 --> 00:21:08,318
Afterwards, Teigo Uesumi's hidden bank account was found,

400
00:21:08,318 --> 00:21:10,018
and by following the money trial, more scan groups

401
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,118
were subsequently arrested.

402
00:21:12,118 --> 00:21:14,118
The case against the remittance scan leader

403
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:17,418
was sent to the prosecutor even though the suspect had died.

404
00:21:17,418 --> 00:21:19,218
And thus the curtain closed on

405
00:21:19,218 --> 00:21:22,018
both the scam case and the murder case.

406
00:22:45,918 --> 00:22:49,318
Huh? It was Shinichi who solved that case?

407
00:22:49,318 --> 00:22:50,618
That's right!

408
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:53,818
Detective Takagi spilled the beans after my interrogation!

409
00:22:53,818 --> 00:22:56,918
How he had seen through the truth like it was nothing

410
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:59,918
after getting a call from Conan!

411
00:22:59,918 --> 00:23:02,318
Wouldn't it be great if he would also take the time

412
00:23:02,318 --> 00:23:04,618
to give his lovely dear wife a ring?

413
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:06,518
That reminds me,

414
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:10,818
that Sera person was also a detective, according to Conan.

415
00:23:10,818 --> 00:23:15,818
That person also said "We'll see each other soon" before we left.

416
00:23:15,818 --> 00:23:17,818
I wonder what that meant?

417
00:23:17,818 --> 00:23:21,418
I don't know. Maybe he's just interested in you. Ran?

418
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:26,218
All right.

419
00:23:26,218 --> 00:23:29,318
Let me introduce to you!

420
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:32,718
Someone who's joining our class as of today.

421
00:23:32,718 --> 00:23:34,218
Sera!

422
00:23:37,118 --> 00:23:39,518
Sera?

423
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,618
A transfer student?

424
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:46,218
What the... she's wearing a skirt!

425
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,518
A girl?

426
00:23:48,518 --> 00:23:51,118
My name is Masumi Sera.

427
00:23:51,118 --> 00:23:53,418
Nice to meet you!

428
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:02,018
Don't mess around!

429
00:24:03,018 --> 00:24:05,918
These bombs will go off!

430
00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:08,518
What's the heck?

431
00:24:08,518 --> 00:24:11,218
My sister, Miku Sawaguri is...

432
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:13,718
She was killed by one of these three

433
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,518
who went to the hot spring with her!

434
00:24:16,518 --> 00:24:18,518
Trying to play smart with me.

435
00:24:18,518 --> 00:24:21,218
You've got quite the nerve!

436
00:24:22,118 --> 00:24:23,518
Next Conan,

437
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:27,518
"The Case of the Besieged Detective Agency (Outbreak)"

438
00:24:43,218 --> 00:24:45,218
Next Conan's Hint:

439
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:47,618
"Signed Books"

440
00:24:47,618 --> 00:24:49,018
Next time, I'm taking the leading role, too.

441
00:24:49,018 --> 00:24:50,418
Please root for me, a high school girl, Masami Sera.

442
00:24:50,418 --> 00:24:52,818
-No, the leading role is... -Mine, you know...
