1
00:00:00,758 --> 00:00:02,358
At the Mouri Detective Agency,

2
00:00:02,358 --> 00:00:05,358
a man who showed up after following three ladies,

3
00:00:05,358 --> 00:00:07,458
intimidated everyone with his gun and bombs,

4
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:10,158
and besieged the entire place.

5
00:00:10,158 --> 00:00:12,458
The man's name was Isao Sawaguri.

6
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:14,958
He's the elder brother of Miku Sawaguri,

7
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:18,658
a mystery writer who killed herself at a hot spring inn a month ago.

8
00:00:19,758 --> 00:00:23,058
Sawaguri who refused to believe that his sister committed suicide,

9
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:25,158
ordered the great detective Sleeping Kogoro

10
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:28,158
to shed some light on the truth.

11
00:00:29,158 --> 00:00:30,758
The three ladies he brought here

12
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:33,658
were all amateur mystery writers and friends with Miku.

13
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,158
Sawaguri suspected that one of them murdered his sister

14
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:39,258
and made it appear to be a suicide.

15
00:00:40,658 --> 00:00:41,658
Soon after Sawaguri found out

16
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:45,158
that Ran's cell phone connection was still alive,

17
00:00:45,158 --> 00:00:47,458
I having no choice, introduced myself as Shinichi Kudo,

18
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:51,158
and formally accepted his demand to solve the case.

19
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:53,758
From the materials and testimonies

20
00:00:53,758 --> 00:00:56,458
pertaining to the case sent my way,

21
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,658
I uncovered the truth behind it,

22
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:01,058
but I couldn't reveal it right away.

23
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:02,558
For Sawaguri had already announced

24
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:04,658
that he would commit murder-suicide with the culprit

25
00:01:04,658 --> 00:01:06,958
once he found out their identity.

26
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:11,558
I had to somehow solve the case without risking any fatalities.

27
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:14,358
However, the police had been steadily waiting

28
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,758
in preparation to snipe down the gunman.

29
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:19,958
Thanks to Ran's quick thinking,

30
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:22,458
we were able to halt the sniping,

31
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,158
but we couldn't waste any more time.

32
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:28,758
Because if the mystery was still unsolved by the next morning,

33
00:01:28,758 --> 00:01:30,758
Sawaguri planned to blow up the agency,

34
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,258
taking everyone with him.

35
00:01:33,258 --> 00:01:37,058
Thus, I look extreme measures.

36
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:38,258
It's all right.

37
00:01:38,258 --> 00:01:40,258
Please calm down.

38
00:01:40,258 --> 00:01:43,258
Because I know the identity of the Rat.

39
00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:44,558
Really?

40
00:01:44,558 --> 00:01:47,958
The Rat that was the last to show up to Miku's room...

41
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,758
Ms. Mitsui,

42
00:01:49,758 --> 00:01:52,558
it can be none other than you.

43
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:13,858
If all cases were men,

44
00:02:13,858 --> 00:02:15,558
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

45
00:02:15,558 --> 00:02:17,358
As the path to the truth twists and twists,

46
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:19,658
Shinichi passes down his final judgment.

47
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:21,058
He sees through the one and only truth.

48
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,958
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

49
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,158
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

50
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:54,805
"The Case of the Besieged Detective Agency (Release)"

51
00:04:12,905 --> 00:04:16,905
Just as expected from the high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

52
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:18,205
Well done.

53
00:04:18,205 --> 00:04:20,605
The dirty Rat, who freaking killed my sister Miku

54
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:25,805
and made it look like a suicide, Tamami Mitsui...

55
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:29,205
He's made it clear that you were the one.

56
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:30,805
No, no...

57
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:33,605
I would never kill Miku.

58
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:35,105
Don't play dumb with me.

59
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:39,405
The famous high school detective is saying you're the culprit.

60
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:42,505
But... but it really wasn't me...

61
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:48,705
Any excuses you have I'll hear you out on the other side.

62
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:52,005
My sister's waiting in the other world.

63
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:56,605
Well, don't forget, you two karate kittens.

64
00:04:56,605 --> 00:05:00,205
About the fact that I've got bombs strapped to my body.

65
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:03,805
And that as long as I can kill this witch,

66
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:06,205
I won't mind dying.

67
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:08,605
Darn.

68
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:10,505
Shinichi Kudo.

69
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:13,005
What the heck are you going to do?

70
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:15,405
Shinichi.

71
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:17,205
Please wait.

72
00:05:17,205 --> 00:05:18,305
Shinichi.

73
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:26,405
I did say that the person whom Miku nicknamed "Rat" was Mitsui,

74
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:29,705
but I haven't said one word

75
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,505
about Mitsui having killed your sister, you know?

76
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:33,205
What?

77
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:35,405
But didn't you just say it?

78
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:39,405
That the "Rat" who went to my sister's room last was this woman.

79
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,505
Yes.

80
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:41,805
Then, why?

81
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:45,005
If I recall, your conjecture was as follows, right?

82
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:48,705
The culprit drugged your sister to sleep, slit her wrist,

83
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:50,505
positioned her over the bathtub in the bathroom

84
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:52,305
and staged a suicide.

85
00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:54,405
After confirming her death,

86
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:56,805
the culprit sent you an email saying "goodbye"

87
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:59,905
using his sister's cell phone.

88
00:05:59,905 --> 00:06:02,205
Thinking the email odd,

89
00:06:02,205 --> 00:06:04,505
you knocked on your sister's door

90
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:06,005
but there was no answer.

91
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:07,005
You had no choice

92
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:10,105
but to climb over the balcony from your room next door,

93
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:13,305
and break into your sister's room from the window.

94
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:17,105
That was when you found her body in the bathroom.

95
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:21,105
In short, the culprit had predicted in advance that you would do so,

96
00:06:21,105 --> 00:06:22,805
hid inside the room,

97
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:26,105
and while you were distracted by your sister's body,

98
00:06:26,105 --> 00:06:29,205
fled through the window you broke according to you.

99
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:34,305
Yes, that's exactly right.

100
00:06:34,305 --> 00:06:35,905
Then,

101
00:06:35,905 --> 00:06:38,405
where did the culprit pass through to make an escape after that?

102
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:40,205
Of course, the culprit went into my room next door,

103
00:06:40,205 --> 00:06:42,805
and just went out the door?

104
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:45,405
I was in my sister's room after all.

105
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,705
When I first went to knock on my sister's door,

106
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:50,205
I ended up raising hell.

107
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:53,405
A lot of bystanders were already there at that point,

108
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:56,605
it would've been easy to mix in with that crowd.

109
00:06:56,605 --> 00:07:00,405
But didn't you say you heard about it as well?

110
00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:02,205
That a guest three doors down

111
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:05,805
witnessed Mitsui coming out from your sister's room

112
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:08,505
in a big hurry with a book in hand.

113
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:13,205
In other words, the room that Mitsui came out of wasn't yours,

114
00:07:13,205 --> 00:07:15,305
but your sister's.

115
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:18,305
That doesn't seem to fit in with your theory, though.

116
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,705
He must have mistaken it.

117
00:07:20,705 --> 00:07:24,705
Since that guest's room was three doors away from my sister's, right?

118
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:26,805
He must have confused her coming out of my room

119
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:29,505
instead of my sister's room next door.

120
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:31,805
No, that wouldn't be the case.

121
00:07:32,805 --> 00:07:34,505
That witness's room was on the same side

122
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:38,305
as your sister's and three doors away.

123
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:41,205
Plus, he said he was about to leave his room,

124
00:07:41,205 --> 00:07:43,405
but as soon as he saw Ms. Mitsui running across in a big rush,

125
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:46,105
he immediately shut the door.

126
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:48,305
If he saw her from that position,

127
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:49,305
the angle would've been too narrow,

128
00:07:49,305 --> 00:07:51,305
and he only saw her for a split second.

129
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,705
He wouldn't have been able to distinguish at all

130
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,905
which room she had come from.

131
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:59,305
In that case, how come that guest knew for sure

132
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:01,505
she came from my sister's room?

133
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:02,905
That's because...

134
00:08:02,905 --> 00:08:05,305
the door to your sister's room Ms. Mitsui came out

135
00:08:05,305 --> 00:08:07,905
of had been wide open,

136
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:11,005
and he had seen the room number affixed to the door.

137
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:14,705
Ms. Mitsui was in such a rush

138
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:17,805
because she wanted to use the restroom at once.

139
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:21,805
The fact that the open door was closed later on

140
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:25,405
proves that your sister was still alive.

141
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:28,205
The doors at that inn are not auto-lock doors,

142
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:30,305
if your sister hadn't locked the door from inside,

143
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:32,305
you wouldn't have gone through all the trouble

144
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:36,805
to break the window in order to enter.

145
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:38,705
Then who was it?

146
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:40,905
Who was the culprit that killed my sister?

147
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:43,505
According to my sister's postings, someone should've been there, right?

148
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:47,905
The murderer, who was still in my sister's room until she got drowsy.

149
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:50,905
About your sister's debut work...

150
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,505
have you happened to read it?

151
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:57,105
No. I'm not much of a reader.

152
00:08:57,105 --> 00:08:59,405
I haven't read that yet.

153
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,605
The title is...

154
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:04,705
"The Death's Funeral Procession".

155
00:09:04,705 --> 00:09:06,305
The main character was a police detective

156
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:07,705
who was desperately pursuing

157
00:09:07,705 --> 00:09:11,005
the shadow of a serial killing fiend.

158
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:14,705
One day, the detective was visited by Death at his side,

159
00:09:14,705 --> 00:09:19,105
who told him, "You won't ever be able to catch him in your lifetime".

160
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:20,805
It was only natural...

161
00:09:20,805 --> 00:09:22,205
Since that detective had been the serial killer

162
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:25,305
who unconsciously wandered the streets night after night

163
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:28,005
and committed the crimes.

164
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:31,505
The detective, upon realizing this fact,

165
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,505
became tormented by his conscience.

166
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:38,305
And took his own life following Death's lead.

167
00:09:38,305 --> 00:09:40,805
Hey, you're not saying...

168
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:44,205
Right. Your sister laid her hands

169
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:45,605
upon her "Death's Funeral Procession"

170
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:48,005
for the first time in ages in order to autograph it.

171
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,305
Is she uncontrollably put herself

172
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:52,305
in the place of the main character she created,

173
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:56,905
and saw a hallucinated image of Death in her room.

174
00:09:56,905 --> 00:10:02,905
You can imagine what your sister might have done afterwards, right?

175
00:10:02,905 --> 00:10:04,205
Don't tell me...

176
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:07,605
My sister kill... killed herself?

177
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:15,405
No, no way. It can't be.

178
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:19,005
That's going to be... a lie.

179
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:30,505
Breach.

180
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,505
Charge in!

181
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:33,505
Charge!

182
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:36,605
No.

183
00:10:47,705 --> 00:10:49,205
Secured.

184
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,305
All's well that ends well.

185
00:10:57,305 --> 00:10:58,705
Good for you.

186
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:01,505
Well... that still remains to be seen?

187
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:05,105
What do you mean?

188
00:11:09,305 --> 00:11:12,005
All right, we will be contacting you for details,

189
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,805
regarding the case of yourselves, if you please.

190
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:17,005
Yes.

191
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:18,605
Understood.

192
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:19,905
I'll be on my way.

193
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,905
Good work, everyone.

194
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:34,805
I'm worn out.

195
00:11:34,805 --> 00:11:38,205
Still, you really had me going there, Kudo.

196
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:40,905
I almost thought you were really going to name the culprit

197
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:44,605
and have that bomber man kill her.

198
00:11:44,605 --> 00:11:48,705
Well, I can understand if you figured out that it was a suicide,

199
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:51,905
but since I've never read Miku Sawagiri's debut work,

200
00:11:51,905 --> 00:11:53,405
I wouldn't have been able to solve it.

201
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:57,205
Sorry, but I haven't read "Death's Funeral Procession" either.

202
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,205
What?

203
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:03,505
That was just a bluff I used for the situation at hand.

204
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,205
In order for that bomber man to truly believe

205
00:12:05,205 --> 00:12:09,205
his sister had committed suicide.

206
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:13,805
Otherwise, for someone who had been leisurely posting on SNS

207
00:12:13,805 --> 00:12:16,805
to suddenly see a hallucination of Death and commit suicide...

208
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:18,605
is an illogical deduction

209
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,505
I'd never give even with my mouth pried open.

210
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:23,305
Hey, you don't mean to say...

211
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:26,405
Right, now on to our main topic.

212
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:28,005
It really exists,

213
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:29,905
Death who killed Miku Sawaguri

214
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:32,005
and made it seem like a suicide

215
00:12:32,005 --> 00:12:34,305
is among those three people over there.

216
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,830
It really exists,

217
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,930
Death who killed Miku Sawagiri

218
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,630
and made it seem like a suicide

219
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,830
is among those three people over there.

220
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,430
Don't tell me...

221
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,030
were we wrong about the nicknames Miku assigned

222
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,830
to those three people?

223
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:02,330
No, they were indeed as I said.

224
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,530
Mitsui, whose family stonemasonry business deals

225
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,530
with rat-colored stones, was Rat.

226
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,930
Yuchi, who works at the bakery

227
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,930
and sells bread that is golden brown, was Fox.

228
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,630
Nihei, the wife of a seal craftsman

229
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,730
who carves ivory-colored seals, was Elephant.

230
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,130
Those were all true.

231
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,030
Then, was the order in which the three people

232
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,430
went to Miku's room wrong?

233
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:31,830
No, the order was indeed Nihei, Yuchi and Mitsui.

234
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,430
Given that Miku's postings on SNS

235
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,230
said the order was Elephant, then Fox, and finally Rat.

236
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,630
In that case, since the last one to visit was Mitsui...

237
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,830
Was Mitsui the culprit after all?

238
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,730
No, you're wrong.

239
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,630
I see. She left the room

240
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,430
but returned afterwards and committed the crime.

241
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,230
No, that wouldn't be the case.

242
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:00,930
Mitsui was seen coming out of Miku's room in a big hurry.

243
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,730
Despite having been seen exhibiting such odd behavior,

244
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,830
the possibility of her returning there again to commit murder

245
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,930
is highly unlikely.

246
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,830
Especially, so if she were a premeditated murderer

247
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,730
who crafted a sealed room and set it up to look like a suicide.

248
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,830
Then, who the heck was the culprit?

249
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,830
Ran. Sorry, but could you read those for us again?

250
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,030
The posts from Miku right before she was murdered.

251
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,030
Yes.

252
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,430
The first one to come pester me for an autograph was Elephant.

253
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,030
Even though my hair had yet to dry from the bath,

254
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,930
that pesky Elephant.

255
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,930
Next to come was Fox.

256
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,330
Trying to stir up an argument again, freaking annoying.

257
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,430
I've signed my autograph, so why can't you just leave?

258
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,930
The last one was Rat, who can't take a hint.

259
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,730
I'll make short work of the autograph

260
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,830
and shoo her away as soon as possible.

261
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,630
Darn, she's still here.

262
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,630
Oh snaps, I'm getting sleepy.

263
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,130
What should I do?

264
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,030
Then Ms. Mitsui, I'll ask you.

265
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,530
When you went to Miku's room,

266
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,030
she didn't let you use her restroom, did she?

267
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,430
That... that's right.

268
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,330
Like I said...

269
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:18,230
She was only being a little mean to Ms. Mitsui with an upset stomach.

270
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,130
Well, was it really like what you said?

271
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,430
What?

272
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,630
Could it be?

273
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:30,530
Right, the one who was still lingering in her room wasn't Rat,

274
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,730
but Fox, the second to come.

275
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,330
Shinobu Yuchi.

276
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,630
It was actually you.

277
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,830
Yuchi is...

278
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,030
The culprit?

279
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,330
How... how come?

280
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,730
See, Miku posted about it, right?

281
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,530
The Fox came to pick a fight and just wouldn't leave.

282
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:03,730
Unfortunately, Mitsui came by in the middle of the argument.

283
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,430
So she hid Yuchi in the restroom for the time being

284
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,730
and intended to make Mitsui go away quickly.

285
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,730
Of course she had Yuchi take the slippers with her.

286
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,930
Since it'd be obvious

287
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,730
that someone else was still inside if there were two pairs.

288
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,930
But at that time,

289
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,130
instead of Yuchi's own damp slippers she had worn from the baths,

290
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,430
she accidentally took Miku's slippers instead.

291
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:27,330
And then Mitsui mistakenly wore Yuchi's slippers,

292
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,930
which felt uncomfortable wearing.

293
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,930
Was that the case, Kudo?

294
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:37,230
Yes. What happened afterwards was just as the bomber man Isao said.

295
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,230
After killing Miku in the bathroom

296
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,030
while disguising it as a suicide.

297
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,130
She text mailed Isao

298
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,530
and induced him to break the window glass and enter the room.

299
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,930
From that broken window,

300
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,630
she crossed over the adjoining balcony to Isao's room.

301
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,730
And then snuck out from that room via the door

302
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,930
and mixed in with the bystanders who were gathered.

303
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,230
But... couldn't we also assume that Nihei, who came by first,

304
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,330
might have been hiding in the restroom the entire time?

305
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,230
Miku posted about Fox who was still there

306
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,530
and called her "annoying".

307
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,130
If Fox had left,

308
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,030
she would've happily posted it without a doubt,

309
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,630
but we saw nothing like that.

310
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,130
Also, Nihei has a methodical personality and is high strung

311
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,130
to the extent that she would line up people's slippers.

312
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,430
It'd be hard to imagine

313
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,530
that she would mistake someone else's slippers for her own.

314
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,230
But, isn't that merely circumstantial evidence?

315
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,730
I do have concrete proof.

316
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,830
As Miku was struggling to escape from the bathroom,

317
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,830
She grabbed the bathmat with her bloody hands, there's the photo.

318
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,030
Although the two marks near the door clearly indicated handprints,

319
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,330
the blood marks farther were those from her fingertips.

320
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,830
That's proof she was grasping something.

321
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,630
And now I'd like to direct your attention

322
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,830
to Yuchi's signed book from Miku.

323
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,930
Depending on the printing method,

324
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,930
the side of a book-also known as the fore edge

325
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,930
would either line up neatly or appear jagged.

326
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,730
But the method would never change

327
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,830
between copies of the same first printing.

328
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,630
However, for the same reason, only Yuchi's signed book

329
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,330
had its fore edge neatly lined up.

330
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,530
It's likely because Yuchi's filed the edge down with sandpaper.

331
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,530
To conceal Miku's bloody handprints she left by grabbing onto the book

332
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,730
in her last moments.

333
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,130
That's the unshakable proof.

334
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,430
She bought another copy

335
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,530
and replaced the cover with the new one

336
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,630
to make it look like nothing was on it.

337
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,630
But the book warped when it was grasped,

338
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,730
so she couldn't hide the blood marks that adhered deeper into the pages.

339
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,030
But why would the signed book be on the bathmat?

340
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,730
While I was carrying her to the bathroom,

341
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,230
after drugging her to sleep,

342
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,230
it fell out from my bathrobe.

343
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,030
Afterwards she bloodied the book,

344
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,130
but I didn't care much.

345
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,830
Since I was going to toss away the book anyway.

346
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,030
But, I couldn't bring myself to do so.

347
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,430
Because inside that book

348
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:16,430
was the most popular story out of all the ones I had written.

349
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,030
"I had written".

350
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,830
Don't tell me...

351
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,330
-Miku stole your work? -What?

352
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,430
Well, since we wrote it together,

353
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,130
I suppose it'd be a joint work.

354
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,730
She asked me for a favor.

355
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,930
"I got invited to publish a book,

356
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,130
so do you mind helping me out?" she said.

357
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,030
Then, that debut work turned out to be a hit,

358
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:46,930
and before we knew it, she had become a Naomoto awardee.

359
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,730
And I wasn't jealous at that time.

360
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,030
Since I only helped her with that one,

361
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,730
and she had earned the award through her own hard work.

362
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,830
I was even proud to be her friend.

363
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,630
And I thought it was my turn to shine,

364
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,630
until I was told this by the publisher I brought my own work to...

365
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,730
This is indeed interesting, but

366
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,530
It's just too much like Miku Sawaguri's literary style.

367
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,930
One Miku Sawaguri is enough.

368
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,630
How about if you try becoming her ghost writer?

369
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,730
I didn't realize it until then.

370
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,430
That she had imitated my writing style

371
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:31,430
and taken it as her own since her debut.

372
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,430
So of course I told her,

373
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,230
"At the very least, please announce to the public

374
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,330
that your debut work was a joint work with me."

375
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,330
But she retorted,

376
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,430
"Are you trying to smear a Naomoto Award winning author?"

377
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,830
and denied my request.

378
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,830
If things went on like that, I'd become a non existent ghost.

379
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,230
That's why...

380
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,830
I decided to make her the ghost instead.

381
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,130
But in the end,

382
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,830
I really should have thrown that book away.

383
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,530
Even if I wanted to read "Death's Funeral Procession",

384
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,130
now It'd just bring back memories of our late nights

385
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,330
conjuring up ideas and racing to put them to paper,

386
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,930
and I could never read it like this.

387
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,430
A book I'm unable to turn a page.

388
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,030
There'd be no point of me keeping it.

389
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,430
Shinichi just left without even saying anything?

390
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,230
Despite having the nerve to butt in

391
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,130
and give a deduction right in front of you?

392
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,930
Yes.

393
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,930
I picked up the phone again

394
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:11,030
after the police came to take the culprit Yuchi away,

395
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,930
but he'd already hung up.

396
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,530
Wearing a skirt?

397
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,330
But, after that, I got an email from Shinichi.

398
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,130
He said "Thanks".

399
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,730
At that time, Shinichi had gone back to his house for some files,

400
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,030
and just so happened to stop by at Dr. Agasa's house..

401
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:34,930
He could've at least shown his face to his sweetheart, I say.

402
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:38,430
Perhaps there was a reason he couldn't show his face.

403
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,630
Well, thanks to what just happened, I really got it.

404
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,430
That Conan and Kudo are on super good terms with each other.

405
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,530
And that you're really tougher than I thought.

406
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,430
Is this about karate?

407
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,730
Hattori says, people collectively,

408
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,930
dubbed them "Hattori of the West and Kudo of the East."

409
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,230
Then, tell me straight up,

410
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,130
which is the greater detective between the East and West?

411
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,030
Help me, Heiji!

412
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,430
People said that someone died in the restroom

413
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,430
of this family restaurant.

414
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,930
Between me and Kudo, which is the real awesome detective?

415
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,130
Let's make it clear once and for all.

416
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,630
Next Conan Special,

417
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,330
"Deduction Battle Between the Detectives of The East and West"

418
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,430
Next Conan's Hint:

419
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,430
"Kansai Dialect".

420
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,030
-Dad, here's a case. -What happened?

421
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,030
Surprise, it's a one-hour special next week.

422
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,230
You don't say!
