1
00:00:04,383 --> 00:00:06,582
This is a great location!

2
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:08,682
"Kei Nakanishi (26)" -It's the pride of the locals.

3
00:00:08,683 --> 00:00:10,782
And it's such a nice clear day, too.

4
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:11,882
Yes.

5
00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:14,782
You really came to visit on such a nice day.

6
00:00:14,783 --> 00:00:16,982
It would've been a fantastic drive

7
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:19,582
if you weren't tagging along, though.

8
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,382
Ran asked me to come with you, so I had to.

9
00:00:22,383 --> 00:00:23,582
She asked me to keep an eye on you

10
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:24,883
so that you wouldn't get all carried away.

11
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,182
All I'm going to do is

12
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:33,382
have Ms. Nakanishi show me around here and there.

13
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:34,683
Really?

14
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:39,282
What?

15
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:40,882
Give that back to me, brat!

16
00:00:40,883 --> 00:00:42,882
How dare you steal it?

17
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:44,682
I found it on the ground.

18
00:00:44,683 --> 00:00:46,682
What's this passionate conversation about?

19
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:48,182
A heart mark's written at the end, too.

20
00:00:48,183 --> 00:00:51,182
Well... That's... You see...

21
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:52,683
That's hilarious.

22
00:00:53,683 --> 00:00:56,883
I'm glad you seem to have gotten over it already.

23
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,582
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Mouri.

24
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:00,982
This is a rare case in which

25
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:03,082
you really helped somebody out. Right, Pops?

26
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,582
It's a first.

27
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,982
I mean... Idiot!

28
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,582
Pops, the light's green!

29
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,083
Right!

30
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,082
A canvas stained black with crime.

31
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,582
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color!

32
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,782
I'm the third wheel on a three people drive.

33
00:01:19,783 --> 00:01:22,082
Where will the cheerful conversation lead to?

34
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,682
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,682
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:27,883
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,820
"Turning Point On A Driving Date"

38
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:16,837
If I remember correctly, I think it was six months ago, right?

39
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:19,937
Yeah. When I went to Haido Kitacho for work,

40
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:21,738
I coincidentally ran into her.

41
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:25,537
A woman named Remi Kirisaki was found hanging

42
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,337
"Remi Kirisaki (30)" -in her room at her apartment.

43
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:32,537
"Kiyomi Fukurai (58)" -She moved here three months ago,

44
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:35,837
but since then she's been saying that she wanted to die,

45
00:03:35,838 --> 00:03:38,637
over and over.

46
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:41,737
I used to live next to her and she always say that to me, too.

47
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:45,337
Through the landlady and Ms. Kei Nakanishi's testimonies,

48
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:47,137
as well as the suicide note that was found,

49
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:49,637
it was apparent she had committed suicide.

50
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:51,037
And on top of that,

51
00:03:51,038 --> 00:03:52,337
her handwriting on the rental agreement

52
00:03:52,338 --> 00:03:54,637
matched the writing of the suicide note.

53
00:03:54,638 --> 00:03:58,538
Kei blames herself for the death of her neighbor.

54
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:01,137
It's my fault.

55
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:05,137
Because I couldn't convince her to not commit suicide.

56
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:07,737
Stop blaming yourself.

57
00:04:07,738 --> 00:04:08,937
But...

58
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:12,437
She's the one who made the final decision to commit suicide.

59
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:14,438
You're not responsible.

60
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:20,137
You don't know how much what you said meant to me.

61
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:22,338
That's why I sent you the thank you letter.

62
00:04:23,438 --> 00:04:24,937
I'm currently in my hometown

63
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:28,437
helping out at the resort inn my Uncle and Aunt have opened.

64
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:31,037
It's a nice place with mountains and beaches.

65
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:34,138
Please do stop by if you're in the area.

66
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:37,537
So that's why you shamelessly came over.

67
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,238
Shamelessly?

68
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:42,537
Oh, my.

69
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:45,637
What's going on? It was smooth riding all the way here.

70
00:04:45,638 --> 00:04:51,237
But why did the suicide of Ms. Kirisaki bother you so much, Kei?

71
00:04:51,238 --> 00:04:53,437
She just happened to be your neighbor, right?

72
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:54,837
That's right.

73
00:04:54,838 --> 00:04:58,437
They were really good friends.

74
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:00,537
How did you know?

75
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:05,537
About a week later, I went to that apartment again.

76
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,437
To check on how you were doing.

77
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:10,337
But you had already moved.

78
00:05:10,338 --> 00:05:12,637
I had plans to move from before.

79
00:05:12,638 --> 00:05:15,337
Yes, the landlady told me.

80
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:18,437
That's when I heard about the small fire incident, too.

81
00:05:18,438 --> 00:05:19,837
That's why.

82
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:21,337
Small fire incident?

83
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:23,137
There seems to have been a small fire incident

84
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:24,738
right near the apartment.

85
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:27,937
Fire! Fire!

86
00:05:27,938 --> 00:05:30,337
Fire!

87
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:32,937
Where's the fire?

88
00:05:32,938 --> 00:05:34,237
What?

89
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:37,437
She told me she was surprised

90
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:38,737
because you came out of Ms. Kirisaki's room.

91
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,437
I went to visit her at her room

92
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:43,837
but she said she forgot something and went out.

93
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:47,637
And so, you ended up watching the room for her.

94
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:51,437
Well, I guess you two were close enough to come and go to each other's.

95
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,837
It's understandable that you were shocked

96
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:56,538
when Ms. Kirisaki committed suicide then, Kei.

97
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:00,338
Watch out, you idiot!

98
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:04,537
What's with that look?

99
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,337
Here you go!

100
00:06:06,338 --> 00:06:09,338
Hey, hey. Even kids don't do that nowadays.

101
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,937
But why did the person called Ms. Remi Kirisaki

102
00:06:14,938 --> 00:06:18,337
contemplate committing suicide in the first place?

103
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:21,237
I asked her that, too.

104
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:24,037
The day after the article of her committing suicide made the papers,

105
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:25,838
it seems that a man came over.

106
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:28,637
Are you sure it's her?

107
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,937
Yes.

108
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:32,437
"Eiji Kamatari (32)" -That debt making non-paying woman

109
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:35,537
fled in here this time?

110
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:38,837
In other words, she got tired of running from debt collectors

111
00:06:38,838 --> 00:06:40,437
and committed suicide.

112
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:41,937
So that was it.

113
00:06:41,938 --> 00:06:45,037
Thanks to you, I finally understand.

114
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,238
No, no. He's just conveying the landlady's story.

115
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:50,637
I know even more.

116
00:06:50,638 --> 00:06:52,437
It seems that she's been using aliases

117
00:06:52,438 --> 00:06:55,637
since two years ago and fleeing around.

118
00:06:55,638 --> 00:06:59,937
Mayuko Hayashi, Miyuki Wada, Kaori Inuyama.

119
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:01,537
She's been changing names one after the other!

120
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:05,437
And even though that brassy woman wouldn't pay off her debts,

121
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:07,438
she played Pachinko all the time!

122
00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:10,637
She used aliases since two years ago?

123
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,637
Then I wonder why she rented that apartment under her real name?

124
00:07:14,638 --> 00:07:16,437
I have no idea.

125
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:18,337
Besides, Pops.

126
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,737
Calling her a brassy woman,

127
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:23,237
somehow it doesn't sound like a description of the same person

128
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:26,137
that Kei and the landlady are talking about.

129
00:07:26,138 --> 00:07:29,137
There's no mistake that it's Remi Kirisaki herself.

130
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:30,637
The relatives who were called

131
00:07:30,638 --> 00:07:33,738
came to confirm her corpse and take her with them.

132
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:37,137
Then it couldn't have been a stand-in.

133
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:38,637
Interesting boy, aren't you?

134
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:40,938
He's just a cheeky brat.

135
00:07:42,438 --> 00:07:45,038
What's this? A police checkpoint?

136
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:49,537
We're sorry to bother you

137
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:52,238
"Tan Yamazumi (35)" -but there was a robbery in the city.

138
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:56,737
The perp has a mustache, is well-built,

139
00:07:56,738 --> 00:07:58,837
and is fleeing on a white sedan!

140
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:01,437
He matches the description perfectly.

141
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:04,237
-What? -You'll get out of the car without resisting, will you?

142
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:06,138
No, I'm...

143
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:08,837
Yes.

144
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:11,037
What? The car was abandoned?

145
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,037
See! Like I told you, I'm the great Detective Kogoro Mouri!

146
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:16,737
You mean that famous...

147
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:18,538
I'm... I'm very sorry!

148
00:08:20,838 --> 00:08:22,937
You made it through safely.

149
00:08:22,938 --> 00:08:24,937
Cut that strange talk of yours out!

150
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,738
You two make a great pair.

151
00:08:30,738 --> 00:08:32,937
It'll be at least a two hour wait.

152
00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:36,737
I'll go ask because I know the owner of the place.

153
00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:38,938
No, we can try another place.

154
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:43,238
That guy.

155
00:09:06,238 --> 00:09:08,937
That's all he wanted to do?

156
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:11,337
He's crazy to go out of his way to do that.

157
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:13,537
This sure is a great drive.

158
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:15,737
You get mistaken for a robber.

159
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:17,037
Looks like it's going to rain.

160
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:20,037
It's because we were talking about that apartment.

161
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:23,037
-What? -That place is cursed after all.

162
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:24,937
The apartment is cursed?

163
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:29,337
Real estate agents are the one who usually introduce apartments, right?

164
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:34,337
But it seems that Remi Kirisaki asked the landlady directly

165
00:09:34,338 --> 00:09:36,737
if there are any rooms available.

166
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:40,037
I'm sure she was lured to that apartment.

167
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:43,537
"If you're going to commit suicide, do it here."

168
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:45,437
I'm sure it was just coincidence.

169
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:47,937
Kei fell victim to it, too.

170
00:09:47,938 --> 00:09:50,737
She came back here six months ago,

171
00:09:50,738 --> 00:09:55,737
but she was originally planning to come back three months ago.

172
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:58,137
And she was just about to move out.

173
00:09:58,138 --> 00:10:02,737
My uncle decided to postpone the opening of the resort inn by three months.

174
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:05,237
You will be jobless if you move out now.

175
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:08,637
No problem. You can stay here for another three months.

176
00:10:08,638 --> 00:10:12,637
Right! Someone is going to move into the room next to yours tomorrow.

177
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:13,837
Is that right?

178
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:15,738
I hope the person's a nice person.

179
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:19,337
Right after she postpone her schedule,

180
00:10:19,338 --> 00:10:23,837
Remi Kirisaki moved in and committed suicide three months later.

181
00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:26,737
In other words, if things moved along as originally planned,

182
00:10:26,738 --> 00:10:29,937
Kei wouldn't have been involved in something sad

183
00:10:29,938 --> 00:10:31,838
like the suicide of her next door neighbor.

184
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:35,237
The apartment stopped Kei from leaving.

185
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:39,637
It made her go through something very sad.

186
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:41,138
What are you talking about?

187
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:44,637
It's nothing.

188
00:10:44,638 --> 00:10:46,337
And how did the negotiation go?

189
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:47,437
It went well.

190
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:51,537
I told him that you were precious guests who came from Tokyo.

191
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:53,138
Precious guests!

192
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:01,337
Boy, that was good.

193
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:03,038
It was delicious.

194
00:11:03,838 --> 00:11:05,437
And Mr. Mouri,

195
00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:08,037
I'd like to show you around here now.

196
00:11:08,038 --> 00:11:10,537
An amusement park! Sounds good!

197
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:12,638
Nothing tops this.

198
00:11:16,738 --> 00:11:18,338
I'll go get some tea.

199
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:23,437
Why do they have this stuff in such a rural area like this?

200
00:11:23,438 --> 00:11:26,038
This is a fantastic drive after all, isn't it?

201
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:29,638
This is the resort inn where Kei works.

202
00:11:31,538 --> 00:11:33,137
But she just said a while ago that...

203
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:34,938
What's going on?

204
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:41,937
It was such a clear day until just a while ago.

205
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:44,637
It's probably just a passing shower.

206
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:46,638
I hope so.

207
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:53,637
It really cleared up!

208
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:56,337
The view is great after the rain lets up, too.

209
00:11:56,338 --> 00:11:59,237
I wish it would keep on raining forever.

210
00:11:59,238 --> 00:12:02,337
What kind of person was Ms. Remi Kirisaki?

211
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:03,837
Not that topic again!

212
00:12:03,838 --> 00:12:06,637
She's a brassy woman, okay?

213
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:09,337
Not that. I'm wondering what she looked like.

214
00:12:09,338 --> 00:12:12,237
She had long hair with a perm.

215
00:12:12,238 --> 00:12:13,337
Did she wear glasses?

216
00:12:13,338 --> 00:12:15,137
Nope, she didn't.

217
00:12:15,138 --> 00:12:16,337
Was she fat?

218
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:18,437
She was rather on the skinny side.

219
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:19,937
Skinnier than you?

220
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:21,237
About the same, I guess.

221
00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:24,337
Was she taller or shorter than you?

222
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:26,537
I think we were about the same height, too.

223
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,637
But why do you ask?

224
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:28,837
That's right.

225
00:12:28,838 --> 00:12:31,038
Just what do you want to know at this point?

226
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:38,637
It's over there, Mr. Mouri!

227
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:41,137
It's huge.

228
00:12:41,138 --> 00:12:43,637
No doubt about it.

229
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,638
That suicide was probably...

230
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:57,577
How dare that brat take her away like that?

231
00:13:01,877 --> 00:13:04,077
Do you have a boyfriend, Kei?

232
00:13:05,277 --> 00:13:06,776
I did in the past.

233
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:11,577
But he died three years ago of an illness.

234
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:15,676
Staying in Tokyo reminds me of him.

235
00:13:15,677 --> 00:13:18,677
So I made up my mind to return here.

236
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:27,076
At last, it's just the two of us.

237
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:30,676
Is it okay to leave Conan all by himself?

238
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,477
It can't be helped since this is a two-seater boat.

239
00:13:35,177 --> 00:13:37,777
It's getting exciting.

240
00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:40,977
Are you all right?

241
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:46,277
I'm perfectly fine, I think.

242
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:51,877
So what on earth is her motive?

243
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:57,476
The next one is what I recommend most.

244
00:13:57,477 --> 00:13:59,876
The cliff of Shikabanezaki.

245
00:13:59,877 --> 00:14:00,977
The time has finally come!

246
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:06,276
The final place has to be the sea coast after all.

247
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:07,876
For her to have gone that far,

248
00:14:07,877 --> 00:14:09,477
something really tragic must have happened.

249
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:13,876
They caught the guy.

250
00:14:13,877 --> 00:14:15,277
Looks like it.

251
00:14:18,177 --> 00:14:21,076
We're sorry to have troubled you, but we somehow arrested him.

252
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:24,076
I thought you said the perp had a mustache?

253
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:27,876
I disguised myself by using a fake mustache.

254
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:29,177
That's nothing to boast about!

255
00:14:32,377 --> 00:14:33,976
Well built...

256
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:35,676
No matter how well you disguise yourself,

257
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:38,376
you can't do anything about the physique, can you?

258
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,276
I guess not.

259
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:42,177
What?

260
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:46,276
Let's go to Shikabanezaki, the goal, the sea coast!

261
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:47,477
Okay.

262
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:58,476
It's so beautiful and refreshing.

263
00:14:58,477 --> 00:14:59,976
Yes.

264
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:02,377
There's no room for evil thoughts.

265
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:07,476
Thank you so much for everything today.

266
00:15:07,477 --> 00:15:09,176
Not at all. Thank you.

267
00:15:09,177 --> 00:15:11,777
Gosh. There's no more time to think.

268
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:14,877
He has to drive the car!

269
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:17,676
Then...

270
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:19,276
We're heading home to Tokyo!

271
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:21,976
I can't go home like this.

272
00:15:21,977 --> 00:15:25,276
I'm so full of unanswered questions. I'm jumbled up.

273
00:15:25,277 --> 00:15:26,876
Unanswered questions?

274
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:28,776
You were planning to come here,

275
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:31,576
but postponed it by three months.

276
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:35,076
Then immediately after that, Ms. Remi Kirisaki moved in, right?

277
00:15:35,077 --> 00:15:38,376
Moreover, she did not go through a real estate agent

278
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:40,876
but by asking the landlady directly in person.

279
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:43,376
She was using aliases since two years ago,

280
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,576
and yet she used her real name to rent the apartment.

281
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,976
Since her handwriting was left on the rental agreement,

282
00:15:48,977 --> 00:15:52,276
it was concluded that she wrote the suicide note.

283
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:55,276
So what?

284
00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:58,176
Since her relatives came to confirm the corpse,

285
00:15:58,177 --> 00:16:02,076
it was no doubt that Ms. Remi Kirisaki is the one who died.

286
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:05,076
But the description of her personality doesn't match.

287
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:06,976
Remember during the small fire commotion.

288
00:16:06,977 --> 00:16:10,776
Kei came bursting out of Ms. Kirisaki's room.

289
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:14,576
Obviously, Kei had access in and out of Ms. Kirisaki's room.

290
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:17,476
Excluding their hair style and glasses,

291
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,876
they both have very similar physiques, right?

292
00:16:19,877 --> 00:16:21,876
So what are you getting at?

293
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:24,476
I can't figure out what's bothering you, either.

294
00:16:24,477 --> 00:16:26,176
The thing that bothers me most is

295
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:30,577
why you postponed coming back here for three months, Kei?

296
00:16:31,977 --> 00:16:35,876
That's because her uncle postponed the opening of his resort inn...

297
00:16:35,877 --> 00:16:37,976
-But look. -What?

298
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:40,176
According to what Kei's uncle is saying,

299
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:42,776
they've been planning to open the resort inn from 10 years ago

300
00:16:42,777 --> 00:16:44,476
during their Silver Anniversary,

301
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:48,076
and it's written here that they did exactly that.

302
00:16:48,077 --> 00:16:51,776
So the opening of the inn was never postponed.

303
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,076
Which means,

304
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:56,476
Kei postponed coming back here for three months

305
00:16:56,477 --> 00:17:00,477
because she had reasons on her side for doing so, right?

306
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:05,176
And something happened during the three months

307
00:17:05,177 --> 00:17:07,176
that she postponed coming back.

308
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:08,277
Don't tell me that...

309
00:17:09,877 --> 00:17:12,677
But that way, everything falls into place.

310
00:17:13,677 --> 00:17:15,476
Hello.

311
00:17:15,477 --> 00:17:17,976
Yes, I didn't know until the time of the small fire alarm

312
00:17:17,977 --> 00:17:23,376
that Ms. Nakanishi and Ms. Kirisaki were good friends.

313
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:28,677
Because I never saw the two together even once.

314
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:31,277
I thought so.

315
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:37,376
It's no mistake that Ms. Kirisaki hung herself in the room next to yours,

316
00:17:37,377 --> 00:17:39,876
but she never...

317
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:45,077
No. No one has ever lived in that room.

318
00:17:46,177 --> 00:17:49,576
You've seen through me.

319
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:53,177
But why did you do something like that?

320
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:57,676
Out of hate from three years ago.

321
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:01,176
I had a fiance.

322
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:03,176
His name was Natsuyuki Ogawa.

323
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:06,376
When I visited him that day, I found him lying on the floor.

324
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,777
I called the ambulance right away.

325
00:18:10,877 --> 00:18:12,876
But a car was illegally parked

326
00:18:12,877 --> 00:18:17,777
and the ambulance couldn't make it to his residence.

327
00:18:18,777 --> 00:18:20,076
"Natsuyuki Ogawa (29)"

328
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:22,776
Kei. Kei.

329
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:26,077
I'm here. I'm here beside you!

330
00:18:27,777 --> 00:18:31,577
He died before reaching the hospital.

331
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:34,976
I heard that it was already too late

332
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:37,876
by the time the ambulance got there,

333
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:42,176
but I still thought that if only that car wasn't parked there.

334
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:44,276
It was frustrating.

335
00:18:44,277 --> 00:18:46,876
Yes. They never answered their calls.

336
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:50,376
I had to give the owner of the car a piece of my mind.

337
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:51,977
But she had the nerve to say...

338
00:18:53,477 --> 00:18:57,976
That guy probably didn't have a long life span, anyway.

339
00:18:57,977 --> 00:18:59,277
Idiot!

340
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:07,276
And that person was Ms. Remi Kirisaki, right?

341
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:10,476
She had the nerve to laugh about your fiance

342
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:12,476
as well as you who just went through losing him.

343
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:16,376
Then you happened to see Ms. Kirisaki three years later somewhere.

344
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:19,477
Just three days before I was planning to come back here...

345
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:28,076
"Anzai"

346
00:19:28,077 --> 00:19:32,676
She was probably using aliases because she was into no good.

347
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:36,776
I figured that she was not a good woman.

348
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:38,576
So you thought about it, right?

349
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,776
You couldn't leave Tokyo leaving things as they are.

350
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:43,976
You had to avenge the death of your fiance who died three years ago.

351
00:19:43,977 --> 00:19:45,176
Yes.

352
00:19:45,177 --> 00:19:46,876
You came up with an idea.

353
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:49,276
In order for you to run free despite killing someone,

354
00:19:49,277 --> 00:19:52,976
it would be best to set up a suicide.

355
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:57,776
That's why you suddenly postponed coming back to your hometown

356
00:19:57,777 --> 00:20:00,776
and disguised yourself as Ms. Remi Kirisaki.

357
00:20:00,777 --> 00:20:01,876
What?

358
00:20:01,877 --> 00:20:04,776
Is that room available?

359
00:20:04,777 --> 00:20:07,676
You rented the room next to your own room.

360
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:11,676
Right! Someone is going to move into the room next to yours tomorrow.

361
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,076
Is that right?

362
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:15,676
I hope the person's a nice person.

363
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:18,576
You acted as Kei Nakanishi yourself,

364
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:21,576
as well as played the role of Remi Kirisaki within one apartment.

365
00:20:21,577 --> 00:20:23,776
I really want to die.

366
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:26,876
Come on, Ms. Kirisaki. Don't say that.

367
00:20:26,877 --> 00:20:28,376
You started dropping hints of suicide

368
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:30,976
to make everyone get that impression.

369
00:20:30,977 --> 00:20:34,076
That means, during the small fire alarm, you were probably...

370
00:20:34,077 --> 00:20:36,276
Fire! Fire!

371
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,676
Fire!

372
00:20:38,677 --> 00:20:41,076
Where's the fire?

373
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:42,277
What?

374
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:44,576
You probably took off your disguise

375
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:48,176
and was just about to go back to your room, right?

376
00:20:48,177 --> 00:20:49,476
Yes.

377
00:20:49,477 --> 00:20:52,276
After setting up the background for three months,

378
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:55,077
you contacted Ms. Remi Kirisaki.

379
00:20:55,677 --> 00:20:57,476
You're using an alias,

380
00:20:57,477 --> 00:21:00,376
but you're Ms. Remi Kirisaki, aren't you?

381
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:02,176
Who's asking?

382
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,477
I'd like to discuss something with you.

383
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:06,876
You created an appropriate excuse

384
00:21:06,877 --> 00:21:09,977
and secretly took her to the room next to yours.

385
00:21:13,277 --> 00:21:16,577
You made it look like suicide and left a suicide note behind.

386
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:21,576
You probably phoned the landlady

387
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:23,676
and told her to get rid of her things

388
00:21:23,677 --> 00:21:26,076
because she wanted to move out of the room.

389
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,376
Exactly.

390
00:21:28,377 --> 00:21:32,377
Are you going to drive me over to the police, Mr. Mouri?

391
00:21:33,777 --> 00:21:34,777
Yes.

392
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:43,276
The sun's completely set.

393
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:47,076
It may have set today, but it will come up again tomorrow.

394
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:48,277
For sure.

395
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:20,477
"Haido Police Station"

396
00:23:26,677 --> 00:23:29,276
I just brought in a suspect!

397
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:30,876
Wait a minute!

398
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:33,576
I cooperated with the police, you know?

399
00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:34,577
Hey!

400
00:23:37,477 --> 00:23:40,377
So it ends up like this after all.

401
00:23:42,177 --> 00:23:43,776
"Next Episode"

402
00:23:43,777 --> 00:23:45,976
Fantastic!

403
00:23:45,977 --> 00:23:48,776
And? What is it, Doc?

404
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:51,276
There's something good coming up after this, right?

405
00:23:51,277 --> 00:23:53,676
It's almost Christmas, right?

406
00:23:53,677 --> 00:23:57,077
So let's use this 10,000 yen gift certificate.

407
00:24:00,477 --> 00:24:02,776
What... what was that voice just now?

408
00:24:02,777 --> 00:24:03,977
It came from the stairs!

409
00:24:06,877 --> 00:24:08,376
