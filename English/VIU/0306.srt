1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,801
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,802 --> 00:00:06,901
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:06,902 --> 00:00:08,601
A real case at a drama shoot.

4
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:10,901
The murder weapon and suspect is nearby.

5
00:00:10,902 --> 00:00:12,501
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:14,501
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,502 --> 00:00:16,702
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,988 --> 00:01:58,987
Pops was asked to act as substitute

9
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:01,188
for doing the opening prologue of a detective drama.

10
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:05,287
He runs into a childhood friend of his, Ruri Ujo

11
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:07,188
who turned into a big name actress.

12
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:10,188
However...

13
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:13,988
Rurippe?

14
00:02:20,088 --> 00:02:21,488
Kogoro.

15
00:02:22,588 --> 00:02:28,388
"Invisible Suspect (Part 2)"

16
00:02:37,588 --> 00:02:39,887
Darn it.

17
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:42,287
You smoke, Kogoro?

18
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:45,187
Yes. You don't smoke, Rurippe?

19
00:02:45,188 --> 00:02:48,487
Did you forget about my father?

20
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:52,287
Oh, right. He was famous in the neighborhood as one that hated smokers.

21
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,487
Right!

22
00:02:53,488 --> 00:02:56,787
Thanks to him, I hate cigarettes, too.

23
00:02:56,788 --> 00:02:59,087
The same here.

24
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:02,487
But in my case, my mother hated cigarettes.

25
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:04,987
So, my father who was a heavy smoker

26
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:08,887
says that he was forced to quit as soon as I was born.

27
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:12,787
But what if you have to smoke in dramas?

28
00:03:12,788 --> 00:03:15,587
I just hold the cigarette in my mouth at times like that.

29
00:03:15,588 --> 00:03:16,588
Right, right.

30
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:19,187
We push the director and producer to do it our way.

31
00:03:19,188 --> 00:03:23,687
That's why you can never be any greater than you father.

32
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:24,887
Kasumi.

33
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:26,387
Well, for a certain someone

34
00:03:26,388 --> 00:03:27,788
who sells herself as a healer type actress...

35
00:03:29,788 --> 00:03:33,288
it might be good for her health image.

36
00:03:34,988 --> 00:03:37,287
Kasumi.

37
00:03:37,288 --> 00:03:39,187
What's with her anyway?

38
00:03:39,188 --> 00:03:41,187
She's jealous of me

39
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,588
because I'm talking intimately with him.

40
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:46,487
I think she's cute, don't you?

41
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:48,487
I see.

42
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:51,087
Just like the victim Mr. Kazami was saying,

43
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:54,387
it seems that they're going with each other.

44
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:55,987
Which means that

45
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:59,288
the lover he is secretly going out with is...

46
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:06,887
Have you already figured out who the killer is,

47
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,487
Mr. Renown Detective?

48
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:10,687
No, not yet.

49
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:13,987
Excuse me, Mr. Mouri.

50
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,687
May I have a word with you?

51
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:16,888
Sure.

52
00:04:20,388 --> 00:04:22,587
Conan, where are you going?

53
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:24,487
To the men's room.

54
00:04:24,488 --> 00:04:26,787
Don't bother the police officers, okay?

55
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:28,188
Okay!

56
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:35,487
What is it?

57
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:36,887
Just what are you up to?

58
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:38,187
Huh?

59
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:41,788
I'm asking you why you're making passes at her.

60
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:44,687
You mean Rurippe?

61
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:48,087
I'm not making passes. We're just childhood friends.

62
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,088
Are you sure that's all there is to it?

63
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:54,987
Is that honestly true?

64
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:56,987
Yes.

65
00:04:56,988 --> 00:04:59,287
Okay then. But if you do anything funny,

66
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:01,388
I don't care if you're a renown detective or what, I won't forgive you.

67
00:05:03,588 --> 00:05:05,587
Hey, hold it.

68
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:09,787
I feel as if I've gone through this sometime in the past, too.

69
00:05:09,788 --> 00:05:13,588
If I'm not mistaken it was...

70
00:05:16,388 --> 00:05:18,687
Hey, kid! What're you doing?

71
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:23,187
This tool box was left here in this room

72
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:26,187
together with the golf glove and coat too, right?

73
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:28,487
That's why I figured maybe there's something in here

74
00:05:28,488 --> 00:05:32,287
besides a cutter knife that is capable of slashing things.

75
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:34,187
Playing detective is okay,

76
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:38,487
but the police checked every nook and cranny of this tool box.

77
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:39,687
Even this tape measure?

78
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:41,587
Yes.

79
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:42,887
Hey, who is it?

80
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:45,987
Who bamitted in a crummy place like this?

81
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:47,587
What does the "bamit" mean?

82
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:51,187
It means to mark the floor with masking.

83
00:05:51,188 --> 00:05:52,787
It's done to indicate where the set is to be placed

84
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:55,387
or to determine the place where the actor is to stand.

85
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,187
Well, I guess the shooting is going to be called off.

86
00:05:58,188 --> 00:05:59,787
So, I'll remove this for now.

87
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:01,087
Wait!

88
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:04,287
Something is fishy about the masking tape.

89
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:06,487
It's a little bloated

90
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:09,087
and something is stuck to the tip.

91
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:10,288
What is this?

92
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:13,988
A wire?

93
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:18,487
I see. I got it!

94
00:06:18,488 --> 00:06:20,187
I've figured out what the murder weapon is.

95
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:22,888
As well as why we can't find it.

96
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:28,887
The room where the coat and the glove were is here

97
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,587
and the scene of the crime is diagonally beyond.

98
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:34,587
If from this room, the crime can be carried out easily.

99
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:37,987
All I need to figure out next is who did this.

100
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:40,087
Something's not right.

101
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:44,087
I can't figure out why Ruri suddenly invites everyone to go outside

102
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:46,988
after seeing the snow through the window.

103
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:50,188
Oh, no! Pops!

104
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:55,787
That brat! He's roaming around the scene of the crime again.

105
00:06:55,788 --> 00:06:56,987
Hey!

106
00:06:56,988 --> 00:06:58,687
Darn it.

107
00:06:58,688 --> 00:07:00,388
Where the heck is he?

108
00:07:05,288 --> 00:07:07,988
I see! I got it!

109
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:11,187
Where is Inspector Yokomizo?

110
00:07:11,188 --> 00:07:13,487
He just stepped out a while ago.

111
00:07:13,488 --> 00:07:15,387
I see.

112
00:07:15,388 --> 00:07:17,587
By the way, do you guys smoke?

113
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:18,988
No.

114
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:22,087
Oh, right.

115
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:24,187
I'd like to see the evidence once more,

116
00:07:24,188 --> 00:07:26,987
so will you please lend me a glove?

117
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,287
Yes, sir. By all means.

118
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:32,988
This is the wallet and this is the cigarette.

119
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:36,087
The coat and the glove.

120
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,988
And this is the victim's lighter.

121
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:45,688
It's out of oil.

122
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:48,887
I've figured out the mystery.

123
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:51,988
All I have to do now is put Pops to sleep with this anesthetic gun.

124
00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:55,287
Huh?

125
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:56,787
I can't use the gun.

126
00:07:56,788 --> 00:08:01,087
I used it at the filming site a while ago.

127
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:03,487
Bummers! What now?

128
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:06,887
I can't use Sleeping Kogoro.

129
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:10,888
I've got no choice but to drop a lot of hints at Pops.

130
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:13,688
Pops!

131
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:17,687
There are many things that I've noticed,

132
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:19,287
will you lend me an ear?

133
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:22,688
Maybe I can help solve the case.

134
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:25,488
I don't need anything like that anymore.

135
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:27,788
But...

136
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:32,788
Don't tell me that Pops already figured the case out?

137
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:37,487
Mr. Mouri, I looked all over for you.

138
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:38,987
Just where were you?

139
00:08:38,988 --> 00:08:44,287
Well, I was going around this building looking for a key to this case.

140
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:46,487
And? Did you find the anything?

141
00:08:46,488 --> 00:08:48,387
Did you solve the mystery of the vanished murder weapon?

142
00:08:48,388 --> 00:08:50,887
Well, what I found was not the key,

143
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:53,387
but just this kid alone.

144
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:55,087
Just as I thought.

145
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:57,187
I see.

146
00:08:57,188 --> 00:09:00,487
We'll continue to look for the murder weapon then.

147
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:02,687
So, if you come up with anything...

148
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:05,087
Okay, I'll let you know right away.

149
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:06,888
Yes, please do by all means.

150
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:10,888
If only I could use the anesthetic gun...

151
00:09:12,988 --> 00:09:15,287
His facial expression changed.

152
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,788
It is as I thought, Pops...

153
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:19,788
He already figured out who the killer is.

154
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:25,587
Rurippe, I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

155
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:28,188
No, she's not the killer.

156
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:35,387
Darn it. I guess I've no choice,

157
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:37,387
but to hit Pops on the head with something

158
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:38,887
and make him pass out.

159
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:40,988
I wonder if there's something I kick.

160
00:09:42,988 --> 00:09:44,087
They locked the door.

161
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:45,288
Hey.

162
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:49,088
I can't go inside if you lock the door.

163
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:52,487
Oh, my. What's up, Kogoro?

164
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:54,388
Why lock the door?

165
00:09:56,588 --> 00:10:00,488
Don't tell me that you're going to seduce me?

166
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:04,587
Darn it. I can't hear what they're saying inside.

167
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:06,587
The most I can do is get this wiretap inside

168
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:08,288
from the space beneath the door.

169
00:10:11,888 --> 00:10:17,187
Or are you suspecting that I killed Mr. Kazami,

170
00:10:17,188 --> 00:10:20,387
and going to try to persuade me untill I admit I committed the crime?

171
00:10:20,388 --> 00:10:21,688
Yes, exactly.

172
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:25,887
I want you to confess on your own initiative.

173
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:27,687
Just as I thought.

174
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:29,488
Pops's got it all wrong.

175
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:32,188
I have to stop him quickly.

176
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:41,466
I want you to confess on your own initiative.

177
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:43,066
Just as I thought.

178
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:44,867
Pops's got it all wrong.

179
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,367
I have to stop him quickly.

180
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:52,966
But you're not the one who's making the confession.

181
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:55,766
The one you're protecting,

182
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:58,666
Mr. Akira Nagumo.

183
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,066
Huh?

184
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:03,466
Just what are you talking about, Kogoro?

185
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:06,666
Why would I have to protect Mr. Nagumo?

186
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,966
You saw, didn't you?

187
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:12,266
Just before seeing the snow fall outside the window.

188
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:13,966
What did I see?

189
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:17,566
Back then, the staff opened the door to the room near the window

190
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,866
and came out, right?

191
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:24,366
I'm sure you saw it from the reflection on the glass door.

192
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,166
Mr. Naburo was coming out from the room next door

193
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:30,067
where Mr. Kazami was taking a nap.

194
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:34,566
You saw the staff about to come out of the room,

195
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:38,467
as well as the figure of the killer who rushed back into the room.

196
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:45,266
You saw how he acted and sensed that he did something,

197
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:47,666
so you invited everybody to go look at the snow outside

198
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,367
and tried to get everybody away from the room.

199
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:55,266
I realized just a while ago that's what happened

200
00:11:55,267 --> 00:12:01,366
when I found Conan by the doorway of the crime scene.

201
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:06,067
Just before I turned the corner.

202
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:08,866
Just as would be expected of a renown detective,

203
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:11,366
was I'd like to say,

204
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:14,566
but you haven't found the murder weapon yet, have you?

205
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:18,567
The knife that slashed Mr. Kazami who was taking a nap.

206
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:22,266
Isn't it more important to figure out the mystery

207
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:25,566
of the missing knife that has a blade about 10 centimeters

208
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,266
before you go around making assumptions

209
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:30,266
about me having witnessed the killer?

210
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:31,666
Yes.

211
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:36,066
We were all too concerned about the blade being 10 centimeters long.

212
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:40,266
Because it's hard to believe that the blade is a small clump of steel,

213
00:12:40,267 --> 00:12:42,666
no more than two centimeters.

214
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:43,767
Huh?

215
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:47,066
A cutter knife.

216
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,866
After the killer killed Mr. Kazami,

217
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:54,666
the blade was folded compactly away

218
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:58,467
and hidden inside this lighter that Mr. Kazami had.

219
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:02,267
Pops got it right!

220
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,266
But, Kogoro,

221
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:09,866
even if a blood smeared blade were to be inside that lighter,

222
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:11,466
it makes no difference that the murder weapon

223
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:14,266
hasn't been found yet, does it?

224
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:16,566
A blade of 10 centimeters means

225
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:20,466
that the knife sunk that deeply into him, doesn't it?

226
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,666
Unless the blade is firmly attached to the grip,

227
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,866
it's impossible to poke that deeply into something.

228
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:29,066
And I'm sure that blood would've splattered on the grip too, right?

229
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:30,266
If that's the case,

230
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:34,866
they should've found a box cutter grip that reacted to the luminol.

231
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:38,766
Okay. Pops, slash back at her.

232
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:39,767
I guess so.

233
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:41,166
See?

234
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,066
Hey...

235
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:46,166
First of all, you're going to have to look for the box cutter grip.

236
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:48,866
-Oh, no. -Hey, Conan.

237
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:51,066
Just what are you doing here?

238
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:52,466
Well...

239
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:53,766
Oh, right.

240
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:56,966
Ran, do you have something sticky like gum?

241
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:58,066
Huh?

242
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:00,866
Sticky like gum?

243
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:02,366
I have some gum

244
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:05,066
that Dad wanted me to bring along to keep him from getting sleepy.

245
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:06,366
I see!

246
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,366
Masking tape!

247
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:10,966
If you wrap the box cutter grip from the end of the blade

248
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:13,366
connected to the handle with masking tape,

249
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:16,866
then blood won't splatter onto the grip.

250
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:20,466
After committing the murder, the masking tape was removed.

251
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:23,866
And the tape was probably pasted onto the floor of the filming site.

252
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:28,766
There were masking tape pasted all over the floor as indicators there,

253
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,666
so it would be very inconspicuous, too.

254
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:32,966
But...

255
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:36,266
But why would Mr. Nagumo do something like that?

256
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:40,266
Even I, the first one to find the body could've rigged the trick, too!

257
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:42,066
I could've used snow to move everyone away,

258
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:44,966
and committed the murder myself!

259
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,866
Don't be ridiculous! You could never kill somebody.

260
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:50,366
Darn it. She sure is a tough one.

261
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,966
Sorry, Conan. It seems that I left the gum in the car.

262
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,967
Ran.

263
00:14:57,167 --> 00:15:00,366
How do you wear brassieres?

264
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:03,467
I never used them, so I don't know how to use them!

265
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:08,866
Hey! Boys don't have to know how to use them.

266
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,766
I guess so.

267
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:12,266
Rurippe.

268
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:14,866
You could never have committed this crime.

269
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:16,566
Why not?

270
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:17,966
Then, tell me

271
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:21,966
how would you hide the blade of a cutter inside this lighter?

272
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:23,767
I just put it inside the lid and...

273
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:30,467
There's nothing inside the lid.

274
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:35,866
Then, your deduction must've been wrong, Kogoro.

275
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:39,566
Maybe you're wrong about Mr. Nagumo being the killer.

276
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,066
Rurippe.

277
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,066
For a lighter like this,

278
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:47,566
you add oil to the cotton that is in here.

279
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,666
First, you remove the bottom

280
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:53,766
and take out the cotton that is inside and make space.

281
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:56,467
Otherwise, you cannot hide the blade of the cutter.

282
00:15:57,367 --> 00:16:00,266
Since I smoke, I realized when the lighter didn't light,

283
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:03,866
it means that the cotton must've been removed.

284
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:07,366
But since you don't like cigarettes and have never used a lighter,

285
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:11,366
you would never even think of hiding something in a place like this.

286
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,066
So, the only person that can think of something like this,

287
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:16,766
as well as someone that you would want to protect

288
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:21,067
is Mr. Akira Nagumo who used to be a heavy smoker in the past.

289
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:24,366
That's why I just said a while ago, didn't I?

290
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:28,166
Why would I have to protect Mr. Nagumo?

291
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:31,166
Well, it's true that I've met him sometimes at work,

292
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:33,066
but I'm not all that intimate with him.

293
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:35,366
I wonder about that.

294
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,266
He's your...

295
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:39,167
Lover, lover.

296
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,667
Because he's your real father.

297
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:46,567
Is that true?

298
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,266
Nothing that was used to commit the murder

299
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:55,366
seems to have been prepared ahead of time.

300
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:59,966
It was probably something that occurred on impulse.

301
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:02,366
As for the cotton with oil on it,

302
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,066
he probably pasted masking tape over it

303
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:06,866
and hid it somewhere on the floor of the filming site,

304
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:09,866
but it would probably be easily found if searched for.

305
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:13,566
Besides, after committing the murder,

306
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:16,366
it would be impossible to remove the cotton from the lighter

307
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:19,166
and putting the blades of the cutter into it with gloved hands,

308
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:22,366
with the risk of somebody walking in anytime.

309
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:26,366
So, I'm sure that we'll be able to find fingerprints somewhere.

310
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:29,566
So, before any evidence comes up,

311
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:31,567
persuade your father to turn himself in.

312
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:36,266
That's right, Kogoro.

313
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:40,266
Akira Nagumo is my real father.

314
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,466
I was born when my mother and he

315
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:45,566
used to be no-name actors at an acting school.

316
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:47,966
My mother found out she was pregnant

317
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,866
only after she split with my father

318
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:54,067
and started going out with my present father that you know, Kogoro.

319
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,566
It never even crossed my mind

320
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:01,366
until we acted in a film together

321
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:05,667
and he mentioned that I looked exactly like his lover in the past.

322
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,966
After I heard of the truth from my mother,

323
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:14,366
I went to complain to him because he called ask to see me.

324
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,667
I wasn't going to have him saying that he was my father.

325
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:21,767
Then, he broke down in tears before me.

326
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,867
So, I used to meet him now and then from that time.

327
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:32,567
A father is a father after all.

328
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:38,166
He killed Mr. Kazami for me.

329
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:41,666
If people found out that he's my real father,

330
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:45,067
my whole family would turn out a mess.

331
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:50,066
That's why, Kogoro...

332
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:52,566
I'd like you to keep this all inside you.

333
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:56,366
Because after all, we are childhood friends.

334
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:57,767
Please.

335
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,067
No way.

336
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:05,666
Being that you're the one asking me to do so,

337
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:09,966
the more I can't accept the deal.

338
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:11,966
I don't want you, my childhood friend to be bound

339
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:16,767
by such a painful and sad lie for the rest of your life.

340
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:22,966
Just as expected of you, Kogoro.

341
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,866
You haven't changed at all, your kind heart.

342
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:27,766
Shut up.

343
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,866
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

344
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:32,066
Because he was the one who called you

345
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,966
and told you that he was my real father from his side.

346
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,266
No.

347
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:39,366
Mr. Nagumo said nothing of that sort back then.

348
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:40,466
Huh?

349
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:43,566
Then, how did you know that we were father and daughter?

350
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:47,766
I figured it out from how he acted back then.

351
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:49,566
The hostility I felt from him back then was not of a man who was upset

352
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:52,766
over another guy making passes at his lover,

353
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:54,566
but rather similar to what I felt

354
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,866
when I went to introduce myself to Eri's father.

355
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:59,067
In other words, the feelings of a worried father.

356
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:05,066
Gosh. So, it's Eri after all.

357
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:07,766
I can never out beat her.

358
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:09,266
No, not her.

359
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:12,966
I remembered her stubborn father and...

360
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:16,166
Hey, do you know why I was studying so hard,

361
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:20,166
and wearing those thick lens glasses during junior high school?

362
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:23,266
It's because I wanted to attract someone's attention.

363
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:26,666
I was under the mistaken impression that you liked smart girls.

364
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:27,867
Huh?

365
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:30,766
Thirty minutes later,

366
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:32,966
through Ruri's persuasion,

367
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:35,266
Mr.Nagumo turned himself in.

368
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:39,967
The actual detective drama that occurred came to an end.

369
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,466
So, you've met Ruri.

370
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,966
She was more beautiful than she looks on TV, wasn't she?

371
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:22,866
Huh? Did you know that she is Ruri Ujo, the actress?

372
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:24,366
Yes, of course.

373
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:28,567
Because unlike him, I attend the class reunions.

374
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:33,466
Right, I heard a lot about you two from Ms. Ujo.

375
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:37,866
About Dad and you getting into a big fight over shoyu or sauce.

376
00:22:37,867 --> 00:22:39,366
He got me angry

377
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:42,666
because he used to always pour sauce over his sunny side up too,

378
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,766
but just because he was embarrassed to say the same thing as I did,

379
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:48,266
he insisted that he wanted shoyu!

380
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:49,666
Oh, I see.

381
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:53,567
Come to think of it, Dad always pours sauce over his sunny side up.

382
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:58,366
He's just that dense of a person.

383
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:00,566
Then, why'd you marry him?

384
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:04,666
It's been so long ago that I've already forgotten.

385
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:08,166
Which gloves do you think are better?

386
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:11,766
Let's see... I like the black.

387
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:16,166
Oh, my. I prefer this gray one.

388
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,466
Really?

389
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,366
Because it's the gray color of a mouse.

390
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:23,466
Doesn't it make you feel warm?

391
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:24,866
Huh?

392
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:30,167
Because the gray tablecloth seemed to be warmer than the black coat.

393
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:36,166
Oh, did I say something funny?

394
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:38,367
No, you didn't.

395
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:42,767
Hey, what's going on? What a weird kid.

396
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:48,067
"Mouri Detective Agency"

397
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,567
What a strange old man.

398
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:03,066
"Next Episode" -He could've been kidnapped.

399
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,366
No way.

400
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:07,966
Rather with that guy, anything is possible.

401
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:10,566
I saw a guy with a mustache at Mr. Itakura's office.

402
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:13,567
He was a big man wearing all black outfit with a Kansai accent.

403
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:16,566
Then, don't tell me that this is...

404
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:20,366
Yes. This is in a case within the range of our profession.

405
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:22,266
A homicide.

406
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:24,066
Oh, no.

407
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:29,567
