1
00:00:01,891 --> 00:00:03,790
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:03,791 --> 00:00:05,790
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:07,890
This case may lead us to those in black.

4
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:09,990
They may be involved in this case.

5
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:11,590
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,591 --> 00:00:13,790
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,991
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:57,422
Excuse me, Detective Mouri!

9
00:01:57,423 --> 00:01:59,822
I'd like to ask you about the recent homicide case.

10
00:01:59,823 --> 00:02:01,322
It is said that Mr. Nagumo who was arrested

11
00:02:01,323 --> 00:02:03,122
confessed that he committed the murder

12
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,422
because Nobuharu was being bullied by Mr. Kazami.

13
00:02:07,423 --> 00:02:10,823
If that's what he's saying, so it is.

14
00:02:11,623 --> 00:02:14,522
All I did was expose the trick that he used

15
00:02:14,523 --> 00:02:16,622
and advised him that it would be wiser to turn himself in

16
00:02:16,623 --> 00:02:19,422
before any evidence came up.

17
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:20,822
If you will excuse me, then...

18
00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:22,222
Mr. Mouri...

19
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:25,823
-Please wait! -Just another word, please.

20
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:31,722
A man says few but the message is still there.

21
00:02:31,723 --> 00:02:34,123
I'm so cool!

22
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:38,522
Ghads, when he rarely solves the case without goofing,

23
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:41,322
he gets all carried away.

24
00:02:41,323 --> 00:02:44,222
Well, I guess I can't help making Pops play detective

25
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:47,922
because I got to get information on the men in black.

26
00:02:47,923 --> 00:02:50,022
But, they sure don't show up.

27
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:52,422
Rewind, rewind.

28
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:56,422
They collect large sums of cash by repeating assassinations.

29
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:59,122
They force people like Ai to make drugs,

30
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:03,323
and go around gathering competent computer programmers.

31
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:08,423
Just what... what are they after?

32
00:03:12,323 --> 00:03:15,022
Hello, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

33
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:16,922
Don't tell me that they're planning

34
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:19,322
to create an incredible game using all that cash.

35
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:21,423
What? A game?

36
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:26,422
The whereabouts of a system engineer who makes games is unknown.

37
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:27,922
Yes.

38
00:03:27,923 --> 00:03:30,422
And you'd like us to find him for you.

39
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:33,422
Hey, tell him I'm not in.

40
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,422
I have to record the re-run of Yoko's drama

41
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:39,022
cutting all the commercials, you see.

42
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:41,322
Yes, now it'll be just fine!

43
00:03:41,323 --> 00:03:43,022
My dad's got a lot of free time today.

44
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,423
Hey.

45
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:48,022
Come on, hurry shave and fix your necktie.

46
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:49,722
Yes.

47
00:03:49,723 --> 00:03:53,622
The whereabouts of a game system engineer is unknown?

48
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:55,722
Don't tell me that...

49
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:57,123
Could it be...

50
00:04:01,623 --> 00:04:07,423
"The Remains of Voiceless Testimony (Part 1)"

51
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:15,622
So he's the system engineer that disappeared about a week ago.

52
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:18,722
And you say this is not the first time he disappeared like this.

53
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:21,022
What do you mean?

54
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:23,722
Well, each time the deadline for the game system

55
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:25,422
that he is ordered to do closes in,

56
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:27,622
he frequently disappears.

57
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:30,422
Well, we thought it's the usual this time, too.

58
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:34,223
But we can't afford to just wait with our fingers in our mouths either.

59
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:36,722
We asked the police to ask him previously

60
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:38,422
and he really bawled us out,

61
00:04:38,423 --> 00:04:40,622
so this time we decided to ask you instead.

62
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:42,222
I see.

63
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:45,922
They don't seem to have anything to do with the guys I'm looking for.

64
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:50,522
So, if you do find him, please contact me...

65
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,822
Hey, you must be kidding!

66
00:04:51,823 --> 00:04:54,322
My place is dishing out the most cash!

67
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:57,522
Hey! Our company's the one

68
00:04:57,523 --> 00:04:59,323
that first ordered the system to him this time!

69
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:04,022
You're not of the same company?

70
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:05,822
"Katsumichi Sugai (39)" -I'm Sugai, the one who ordered him

71
00:05:05,823 --> 00:05:09,022
to make the system for the Igo software this time.

72
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:10,822
"Jouhei Naito (47)" -I'm Naito,

73
00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:13,022
and asked him to make a chess software.

74
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:15,822
"Ryusuke Soma (44)" -I asked him to make a shogi software.

75
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:17,522
My name's Soma.

76
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:19,322
But, is it possible for one person

77
00:05:19,323 --> 00:05:21,722
to handle making three different kinds of game software at once?

78
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:23,922
That's why we want to find him and complain!

79
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,822
That things are not how we thought they were!

80
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:28,522
We all went to place our order to him separately,

81
00:05:28,523 --> 00:05:32,222
and this is what he told each of us,

82
00:05:32,223 --> 00:05:34,222
"I haven't signed a contract with anyone this time

83
00:05:34,223 --> 00:05:35,822
so leave it to me".

84
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:37,322
When did you find out that he was taking work

85
00:05:37,323 --> 00:05:39,222
from all of you at the same time?

86
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:43,423
A week ago, we all received this e-mail from him.

87
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:48,222
Taking on three jobs at the same time sure is tiring.

88
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,822
Well, since my heart seems to be doing pretty good recently,

89
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:52,522
I think I'll leave my office for a while

90
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:54,722
and take my time working on my orders.

91
00:05:54,723 --> 00:05:56,822
-This man... -So, please be patient until I'm finished.

92
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:00,022
I didn't notice because he was wearing glasses in the picture,

93
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:03,522
but isn't he Mr. Taku Itakura, who is famous for computer graphics?

94
00:06:03,523 --> 00:06:07,822
Yes, he wears contacts when he appears in public.

95
00:06:07,823 --> 00:06:09,122
Do you know him?

96
00:06:09,123 --> 00:06:13,622
Yes, he comes out a lot in the credit of the movies.

97
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,022
Ever since his eyesight got bad about 3 years ago,

98
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:17,922
he left the field of computer graphics

99
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:20,822
and now concentrates on developing systems.

100
00:06:20,823 --> 00:06:26,022
If he's that famous, he could've been kidnapped.

101
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:27,422
No way.

102
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:31,023
Rather with that guy, anything is possible.

103
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:33,122
About 2 years ago,

104
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:35,722
I saw a guy with a mustache at Mr. Itakura's office.

105
00:06:35,723 --> 00:06:39,723
He was a big man with a Kansai accent.

106
00:06:41,223 --> 00:06:43,522
I'm sure you've seen him, too.

107
00:06:43,523 --> 00:06:47,523
He was at the Mantendo game convention.

108
00:06:48,823 --> 00:06:51,023
Tequila!

109
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:54,723
What did the big man say?

110
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:58,222
What were they talking about at the office?

111
00:06:58,223 --> 00:07:00,122
I don't know.

112
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:03,622
When I got there, he was saying, "We don't need you no more",

113
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,522
and he was ready to leave.

114
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:08,122
Is that all? Isn't there more?

115
00:07:08,123 --> 00:07:10,622
Hey, Conan. Just what's the matter with you?

116
00:07:10,623 --> 00:07:11,922
Darn.

117
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:16,022
I've no choice but to find Mr. Itakura and ask him myself.

118
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:17,822
If I'm not mistaken,

119
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:20,222
that big man supposedly died in the explosion back then,

120
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,622
so I don't think he's involved.

121
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:23,522
The problem is this picture.

122
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:25,922
How shall we start searching for him?

123
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:29,022
I think he's in a hotel or something somewhere.

124
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,023
Hotel's refuse to give out private information of their guests, too.

125
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:36,523
Besides, he's probably using a pseudonym anyway.

126
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:39,622
Ran.

127
00:07:39,623 --> 00:07:44,122
I want to eat sashimi, Tientsin food and beef stew tonight.

128
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:47,422
Hey, wait second. That's Japanese, Chinese and Western-style food.

129
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:48,722
You can't even get that combination of food

130
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:50,322
at a family restaurant that's got almost all kinds of food.

131
00:07:50,323 --> 00:07:52,822
Which means if one customer orders all three kinds of food by himself,

132
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:55,622
people will think he's a weird customer, right?

133
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:57,223
A weird customer?

134
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:01,222
Come to think of it, he has a shogi board,

135
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:04,822
an Igo board and a chessboard in his room.

136
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:08,522
Have you heard what he took with him from his workplace?

137
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:10,322
I heard that he packed the notebook type computer

138
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,222
that he always uses, and a few discs in his bag and left.

139
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:17,322
He didn't take anything else with him, then?

140
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:18,323
Yes.

141
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:22,122
What is with this hotel?

142
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:24,122
Who may I ask are you?

143
00:08:24,123 --> 00:08:27,622
I'm the one who borrowed the shogi, chess and Igo game from you.

144
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:30,622
The phone in my room is suddenly not working.

145
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:32,722
I'm calling from my cell phone now,

146
00:08:32,723 --> 00:08:34,222
hurry and do something about it!

147
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:38,022
We do not rent out things like that in our hotel.

148
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:40,723
Oh, I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

149
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:45,223
Okay, next it's Hotel New Baker.

150
00:08:46,623 --> 00:08:49,522
If a guest borrows shogi, chess, and Igo board all by himself

151
00:08:49,523 --> 00:08:52,822
and stays at the hotel for a week,

152
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:56,522
I'm sure the employees of the hotel are talking about him.

153
00:08:56,523 --> 00:08:58,922
I'm calling on my cell phone right now,

154
00:08:58,923 --> 00:09:00,122
but hurry and do something, will you?

155
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,422
You're Mr. Itakura of room 2004, aren't you?

156
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:05,822
Right, room 2004.

157
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:09,322
I'll send somebody over to your room right away, sir.

158
00:09:09,323 --> 00:09:13,422
The telephone cord seems to have unhooked!

159
00:09:13,423 --> 00:09:15,523
I'm so sorry.

160
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:19,923
Hotel New Baker, room 2004!

161
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:24,922
Ghads, why are you guys coming with me?

162
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:26,822
You're nothing but trouble!

163
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:28,722
Because Conan said...

164
00:09:28,723 --> 00:09:30,222
It's not fair, Pops.

165
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:34,223
I know you're planning to eat at the luxurious hotel restaurant.

166
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:37,622
No big deal, Mr. Detective.

167
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:41,422
If Mr. Itakura is found, we'll treat you to a meal.

168
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:43,423
Oh, well.

169
00:09:47,223 --> 00:09:51,322
So this is his hide-out.

170
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:54,822
You're all competitors in the business, aren't you?

171
00:09:54,823 --> 00:09:58,122
Why'd you all end up coming here together?

172
00:09:58,123 --> 00:10:02,622
Because we found out that he took jobs from all three of us at once.

173
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,822
All of us who are in charge of the job we ordered to him

174
00:10:03,823 --> 00:10:06,222
decided that we three should talk to him together.

175
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:10,122
And so, it dawned on me to ask you to help us, Mr. Mouri.

176
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:13,922
I was the one, who suggested that we ask a detective to help us!

177
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:16,922
No, I'm the one who mentioned his name.

178
00:10:16,923 --> 00:10:20,522
Idiot! I'm the one who contacted him by phone.

179
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:22,322
I'm the one who first mentioned the idea, right?

180
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:23,722
Gosh.

181
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:27,323
Man, Yoko's program is over.

182
00:10:28,523 --> 00:10:30,822
Oh, my. Wearing a cheap wristwatch like that,

183
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:32,523
I'm sure you'll get some snide remarks about it.

184
00:10:33,523 --> 00:10:35,922
Mr. Itakura is really picky when it comes to watches.

185
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:38,022
-Look, that's why... -We also...

186
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:40,622
Is your wristwatch genuine or what?

187
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:43,422
You jerk! I just bought it 5 days ago, it's brand new.

188
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:46,323
I'll bet yours is fake.

189
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:58,422
I'm sorry. Mr. Naito, can you push the 20th floor for me, please?

190
00:10:58,423 --> 00:10:59,622
Sure.

191
00:10:59,623 --> 00:11:02,223
Let's see.

192
00:11:07,123 --> 00:11:10,422
I'm sure that Mr. Itakura will be surprised seeing us all here.

193
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:11,523
Yes.

194
00:11:12,623 --> 00:11:16,422
I wonder if it's okay to head for the hotel room just like that?

195
00:11:16,423 --> 00:11:18,322
Mr. Itakura is a man who is somehow

196
00:11:18,323 --> 00:11:20,823
involved with Tequila, a member of the organization.

197
00:11:22,123 --> 00:11:25,222
I wonder if it's safe for Ran, Pops and those people

198
00:11:25,223 --> 00:11:27,123
to go to his room?

199
00:11:28,723 --> 00:11:32,322
Those last words that Tequila said to Mr. Itakura,

200
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:34,222
"You're of no use to us anymore".

201
00:11:34,223 --> 00:11:35,223
In other words,

202
00:11:35,224 --> 00:11:38,622
it could mean, "We're finished with you, so we're going to kill you".

203
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,622
What if those guys are hiding near here

204
00:11:40,623 --> 00:11:43,422
to get rid of Mr. Itakura.

205
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:46,423
Rather, they may already be in his room.

206
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:51,422
Come on, idiot. What am I getting all panicky for?

207
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,022
Cool head.

208
00:11:53,023 --> 00:11:55,922
Tequila said so 2 years ago.

209
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,622
If they really meant to kill him,

210
00:11:57,623 --> 00:12:00,423
Mr. Itakura would've been killed long ago.

211
00:12:01,123 --> 00:12:04,222
Besides, if Mr. Itakura is a member of the organization,

212
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,822
he would never let an outsider such as Mr. Soma, enter the room

213
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:10,323
while he is talking to Tequila.

214
00:12:13,323 --> 00:12:15,322
At any rate, we've got to meet Mr. Itakura

215
00:12:15,323 --> 00:12:18,023
and get him to somehow tell us what's going on.

216
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:22,823
I've got to find out why Tequila came to his office.

217
00:12:32,523 --> 00:12:33,622
Strange.

218
00:12:33,623 --> 00:12:36,722
He's got this "Don't Disturb" sign hanging on the door and yet...

219
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:39,222
He probably went out to eat or something.

220
00:12:39,223 --> 00:12:42,023
Let's wait in front of here, then.

221
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:46,223
Thank you so much for the trouble.

222
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:48,322
It's an automatic lock door,

223
00:12:48,323 --> 00:12:50,722
so please make sure you take your key along with you.

224
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:52,223
Yes, I will.

225
00:12:54,923 --> 00:12:56,323
Excuse me, mister!

226
00:12:58,123 --> 00:13:01,223
Could you open my uncle's room, too?

227
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:05,822
It seems he forgot that we were coming and went out.

228
00:13:05,823 --> 00:13:07,022
But...

229
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:10,023
Hurry! Or I'm going to leak.

230
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:14,922
I gotta go...

231
00:13:14,923 --> 00:13:17,023
I'm really sorry, thank you.

232
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:23,122
You're pretty sharp, sonny.

233
00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:25,822
Because if Mr. Itakura comes back

234
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:27,722
and sees us all in front of the door of his room,

235
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,922
he might run away, right?

236
00:13:29,923 --> 00:13:33,523
But that's no need for that, sonny.

237
00:13:34,323 --> 00:13:37,822
It seems that Mr. Itakura has just dozed off.

238
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:39,323
Of all things I tell you...

239
00:13:41,123 --> 00:13:43,722
Hey, get up. Hey.

240
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:46,323
You can't get away, Mr. Itakura.

241
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,923
What?

242
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:02,708
Mr. Itakura!

243
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,608
Mr. Itakura?

244
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:06,308
No good.

245
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:09,208
He's been dead for more than a day.

246
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:11,508
What? It can't be...

247
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:13,409
I'll go call the police.

248
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:16,608
What happened?

249
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:19,408
Probably a heart attack.

250
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:22,208
Pills are scattered all over the desk.

251
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,408
He probably had a sudden heart attack

252
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:26,208
and tried to drink medicine,

253
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:28,708
but couldn't, and died.

254
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:32,909
I tell you. It's because he goes into hiding.

255
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:41,608
No, Mr. Itakura didn't die of an illness.

256
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:43,708
He was killed by someone.

257
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:45,508
But, why?

258
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:49,609
Why did all clues of those guys vanish just like that?

259
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:54,409
Darn!

260
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:57,408
What's that?

261
00:14:57,409 --> 00:14:58,709
A diary?

262
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:03,509
Mr. Itakura's diary.

263
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:07,709
If so, maybe there's something in it.

264
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:12,009
About what Tequila came to visit Mr. Itakura for...

265
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:18,308
and what the men in black are trying to do.

266
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:20,508
Maybe looking through this

267
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:22,008
will give us an idea.

268
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:23,009
Hey!

269
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:27,308
Don't you dare touch the belongings of a dead person!

270
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:30,209
Seriously. The minute I take my eyes off of you...

271
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:34,708
Darn. I can't do a thing about it after all.

272
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:37,108
I guess I'll have to let him know what's going on

273
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:39,708
to look inside the diary.

274
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:40,709
About the fact that Mr. Itakura

275
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,208
didn't die a natural death by a heart attack,

276
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,308
but was made to look that way by someone.

277
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:50,408
And that the possibility of that someone being one of the three here is,

278
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,009
is very likely.

279
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:59,808
The victim is Mr. Taku Itakura, age 45,

280
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:02,509
a system engineer of games.

281
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:05,408
And, the cause of his death is?

282
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:07,508
I can't say anything decisive

283
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,708
but there are no visible external injuries.

284
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,308
Judging from the fact

285
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:13,608
that he was taking doses of a coronary enlargement drug,

286
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:16,608
it is likely that he had a heart attack.

287
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,608
He's probably been dead for about 2 days.

288
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:23,208
Inspector! We got a hold of Mr. Itakura's doctor.

289
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:24,408
And?

290
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:27,708
Mr. Itakura's heart seems to have been in very bad shape,

291
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,608
and he was scheduled to undergo surgery

292
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:32,608
as soon as he completed the work he had taken on this time.

293
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:34,108
Which means,

294
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:37,008
this case is not one that's to be handled by you.

295
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:39,709
Yes, it sure looks to be that way.

296
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:43,608
But, if he's been dead for two days,

297
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:46,408
why didn't any of the hotel personnel realize it?

298
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:50,908
He used to hate people coming into his working place.

299
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,908
Yes, that's right. Just the other day,

300
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:55,208
he was fuming about the fact that the papers on his desk

301
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:57,008
had been moved 10 centimeters.

302
00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:00,708
And, he rarely changes the sheets he uses at home either,

303
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,608
so I'm sure he refused to have his bed made.

304
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:06,008
Who are those three people?

305
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:10,608
They are employees of the companies that placed jobs to Mr. Itakura.

306
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,608
They came to ask me

307
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:17,208
to search for Mr. Itakura who disappeared a week ago.

308
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:22,508
And, you found him all right, but he was dead?

309
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,108
Yes.

310
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,208
But it's no wonder that he ended up this way,

311
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,408
being that he confined himself in a hotel, neglecting his health.

312
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:33,108
I see.

313
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:35,909
I think this man favors tidiness.

314
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:39,908
Because when we came into this room,

315
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:43,608
this man was sitting on the chair with his face pushed down on the desk,

316
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:46,909
and yet there are no marks left on the desk.

317
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,908
Marks?

318
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:52,008
The marks of his saliva.

319
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:54,208
If somebody drools as much as he does,

320
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:56,208
it would usually dirty the desk too, wouldn't it?

321
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,508
I'm sure the man wiped it.

322
00:17:58,509 --> 00:17:59,808
Idiot!

323
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:02,208
Why would a man who is suffering from a heart attack

324
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:04,908
wipe the desk before drinking his medicine?

325
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:07,908
Then, who wiped the desk?

326
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:10,208
I wonder who can it be?

327
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:12,708
Besides, this is the first time that I heard that the victim

328
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:15,408
was found with his face down on the desk.

329
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:17,908
Oh, well. He slid to the floor when we shook him...

330
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:20,209
If so, then it's strange.

331
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:23,408
The back of the victim's hand.

332
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:25,808
If the hand of the victim whose face was down on the desk

333
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:29,608
was found stiff in this position, his hand would've had to be

334
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,808
stuck between the desk and his body all this time.

335
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:35,908
But there are no such traces left.

336
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:39,708
Don't tell me that Mr. Itakura died somewhere else?

337
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:42,808
But the hands and feet of the corpse

338
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:47,008
is completely stiff in this manner, inspector.

339
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:49,208
If so, it would be impossible

340
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:53,209
unless someone tied Mr. Itakura onto the chair deliberately.

341
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:58,108
I see.

342
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:01,108
So Mr. Itakura was probably made to sit in the chair,

343
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:04,008
tied up with his hands on his chest,

344
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,108
and was unable to take his medicine unless somebody helped him drink it.

345
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:10,408
Then, don't tell me that this is...

346
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:14,409
Yes. This is in a case within the range of our profession.

347
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:17,409
A homicide.

348
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:20,409
Oh, no.

349
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:25,308
But if so, there should be marks of him having been tied up.

350
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:27,308
How about it, coroner?

351
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:30,608
There are no such clear traces,

352
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:32,308
but it seems that exterior pressure

353
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:33,908
had been applied to a wide area over his body,

354
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:36,908
from the many visible traces of blood congestion.

355
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,709
Just what does that mean?

356
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:42,408
This blanket is soft and warm!

357
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:45,108
Conan! Stop that.

358
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:46,608
But, what's this?

359
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:49,909
It's got sticky stuff on here and there!

360
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:53,508
I get it. It's the blanket.

361
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:54,908
The blanket?

362
00:19:54,909 --> 00:20:00,208
The killer probably wrapped Mr. Itakura's body with the blanket,

363
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:04,008
made him sit in the chair and then wrapped his body up with masking tape.

364
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:07,108
A pillow or something was probably placed in between his lap and chest,

365
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:10,408
to make him lean against the desk.

366
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,108
I see. If so, there would be no traces.

367
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:16,708
Which means that the legs of this table that are fixed in place

368
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:19,808
is what held his chair in place.

369
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:21,908
Although it looks as if they removed it once,

370
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:25,509
a little of the adhesive of the masking tape can still be detected.

371
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:31,108
In other words, the killer left Mr. Itakura in that position

372
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:33,708
until he died of a heart attack.

373
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:36,508
Then after postmortem rigidity spread throughout his body,

374
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:39,408
they came back again to remove the masking tape and blanket.

375
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:42,608
That is, they made it look like he died of an illness.

376
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:43,609
Okay.

377
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,108
Ask the hotel employees if they saw any suspicious-looking people

378
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:49,108
during the last three days.

379
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:50,408
Yes, sir!

380
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:51,609
A hotel...

381
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:55,408
Well, the thing is, I called this hotel making believe

382
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:59,408
that I was Mr. Itakura to hunt down this room.

383
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:01,708
I told them that I was the one who borrowed the shogi, chess and Igo games.

384
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:04,008
And complained to them saying that my telephone broke down,

385
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:06,809
so to hurry and do something about it.

386
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:11,508
And that's how I got the room number to this room.

387
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:14,708
I heard them laughing on the other side of the line after that.

388
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:16,708
Saying, "Not again".

389
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,008
What?

390
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:21,308
Which means that somebody else could've done the same thing

391
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:23,408
to find out where he was, too?

392
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:25,608
Well, but I wonder if there would be anyone

393
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:28,208
who have the same sort of brains that I, Kogoro Mouri has.

394
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:31,008
Inspector! We found another suspicious person

395
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:33,608
who pretended to be Mr. Itakura saying that

396
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:34,908
the phone of his room broke down.

397
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:37,608
Oh, so there was someone else.

398
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:40,308
When the employee went to check the room later,

399
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:41,309
Mr. Itakura yelled at him

400
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,208
and chased him away saying, "I didn't call you".

401
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:44,508
I guess it would be safe to say

402
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:47,408
that the killer is the one who made the phone call.

403
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:49,008
But how did you know

404
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:54,008
that Mr. Itakura borrowed the shogi, chess and Igo game from the hotel?

405
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:56,008
From his mail.

406
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:58,908
I saw the mail with the image attachment

407
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:01,208
that Mr. Itakura sent to the three of them.

408
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:07,109
That is, Mr. Itakura sitting in front of a shogi, chess and Igo board.

409
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:09,508
I see.

410
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:11,108
In other words,

411
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:15,608
all three of you could've used the same method

412
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:18,908
that Mr. Mouri used to come here.

413
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:20,608
What?

414
00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:22,308
Are you serious?

415
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:23,809
No way.

416
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:00,808
"Next Episode" -Mr. Itakura seems to have been

417
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:03,709
keeping a diary every day since 5 years ago.

418
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,308
Which means it's in there, I'm sure.

419
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:09,808
The day two years ago when Tequila came to see him

420
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:11,209
should be there.

421
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:13,209
Could it be...

422
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,408
Yes.

423
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:17,808
Mr. Itakura had written information

424
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:20,408
indicating who the killer is.

425
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:23,308
That is, his dying message.

426
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:24,808
