1
00:00:00,602 --> 00:00:02,301
I awoke

2
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:05,701
to find myself in the dark.

3
00:00:05,702 --> 00:00:07,701
I was on my way to go to buy

4
00:00:07,702 --> 00:00:10,401
a new game software together with Ayumi, Genta and Mitsuhiko

5
00:00:10,402 --> 00:00:14,402
when I witnessed a person in a certain office cracking a safe open.

6
00:00:16,702 --> 00:00:18,901
However, I was attacked

7
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:22,902
and of all things locked inside a coffin.

8
00:00:25,202 --> 00:00:27,601
At the same time, Pops was investigating on

9
00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:31,101
the chairman of a certain industrial group who had died 3 years ago,

10
00:00:31,102 --> 00:00:34,401
called Mr. Gotaro Karahashi, because the will that he had written was stolen

11
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:37,801
and Pops was asked to look for it as well as to find the perp who stole it.

12
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:39,401
Just when I got to use my Detective Squad badge

13
00:00:39,402 --> 00:00:43,201
and got hold of the members of the Detective Squad,

14
00:00:43,202 --> 00:00:46,402
the darkness I was locked up in began to move.

15
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:02,201
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

16
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:04,601
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

17
00:01:04,602 --> 00:01:06,501
Trapped in the dark.

18
00:01:06,502 --> 00:01:08,901
There seems to be no escape.

19
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,501
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:12,401
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:14,902
His name is Detective Conan!

22
00:02:43,114 --> 00:02:48,414
"Conan Cornered in the Darkness (Part 2)"

23
00:02:49,114 --> 00:02:51,013
What's the matter, Edogawa?

24
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:52,313
Edogawa!

25
00:02:52,314 --> 00:02:54,013
It's a car.

26
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:56,313
This coffin is in a car.

27
00:02:56,314 --> 00:02:58,613
I'm inside a hearse.

28
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:00,413
-A hearse? -A hearse?

29
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:01,813
Yeah.

30
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,813
I smell incense

31
00:03:03,814 --> 00:03:06,414
and the cold air of dry ice.

32
00:03:07,414 --> 00:03:09,513
No doubt about it.

33
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:12,113
I'm in a double bottom coffin

34
00:03:12,114 --> 00:03:14,113
and above me...

35
00:03:14,114 --> 00:03:15,814
is someone else's corpse.

36
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:19,913
Let's go look for him right away!

37
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:22,413
I'm sure we'll find it right away if it's a hearse!

38
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:23,613
Yes, I think so!

39
00:03:23,614 --> 00:03:24,814
I wonder about that.

40
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:27,713
Nowadays,

41
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:30,213
there are only a few old-fashioned type hearses

42
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:32,413
and more of the regular sedan-type ones.

43
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:35,013
So, maybe it won't be all that easy to find.

44
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,813
I think we should contact the police after all.

45
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:39,014
Wait, Haibara!

46
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:42,513
Even to contact them, you'll need more information.

47
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:46,413
9 out of 10 the place is a funeral hall, so...

48
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:48,614
Okay. I'll check on it.

49
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:52,714
"Beika-cho Funeral Halls"

50
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:56,513
Let's split up and look for him.

51
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:59,713
If we and find a place that just finished the funeral ceremony...

52
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:00,913
I see!

53
00:04:00,914 --> 00:04:04,713
Conan would be in the hearse that took off from there!

54
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:08,713
But if that's true, he'd be heading for...

55
00:04:08,714 --> 00:04:10,713
Yes. The crematory.

56
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:12,813
Crematory?

57
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:15,113
Conan's going to be cremated?

58
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:17,314
So, we've got to rush and search for him!

59
00:04:26,414 --> 00:04:28,813
No good.

60
00:04:28,814 --> 00:04:30,114
This side too.

61
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:34,214
All of you.

62
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:37,113
Ran.

63
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:40,413
I'm sorry, can you wait here a while?

64
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:42,813
I was worried about all of you.

65
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:44,313
Where's Conan?

66
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:45,613
We found him!

67
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:46,713
Really?

68
00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:49,413
He's in a hearse now!

69
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,014
A hearse?

70
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:55,514
"Asada Law Firm" -Oh, this is...

71
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,913
A will?

72
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:02,513
"Will" -What? The Sleeping Kogoro's client?

73
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:04,513
Attorney Asada is?

74
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:07,913
Right. Dad came here early this morning.

75
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:11,913
Could it be related to the burglary that Conan was talking about?

76
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:15,013
I guess so.

77
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,313
But he just called a while ago

78
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:20,913
to say that he may be attending a funeral together with Attorney Asada,

79
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:24,813
so to bring his funeral clothes over.

80
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:26,313
-A funeral? -A funeral?

81
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:28,313
The place is over here.

82
00:05:28,314 --> 00:05:31,413
Right, it's this funeral hall.

83
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,713
What?

84
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:34,513
What's wrong, all of you?

85
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:36,613
Ran, hurry!

86
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:38,313
Hurry, please!

87
00:05:38,314 --> 00:05:39,914
We're going without you!

88
00:05:42,014 --> 00:05:44,113
What?

89
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:46,813
Conan is in a coffin?

90
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,413
The will is in there too?

91
00:05:49,414 --> 00:05:51,413
Are you sure?

92
00:05:51,414 --> 00:05:53,713
Conan said so!

93
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:56,413
He says it's in a small paulownia box.

94
00:05:56,414 --> 00:05:59,213
"Kimihiko Asada (55), Lawyer" -That's it! No doubt about it!

95
00:05:59,214 --> 00:06:00,813
We did it!

96
00:06:00,814 --> 00:06:03,213
And Dad, what about the funeral?

97
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:05,113
It just finished a while ago.

98
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:09,013
The hearse went off to the crematory together with the family too.

99
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:10,813
What?

100
00:06:10,814 --> 00:06:12,213
-We thought so! -We thought so!

101
00:06:12,214 --> 00:06:13,513
Oh, no.

102
00:06:13,514 --> 00:06:14,813
No joke.

103
00:06:14,814 --> 00:06:16,013
-Conan. -Excuse me.

104
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:20,813
You mean, the perp disposed of the corpse as well as the will.

105
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,713
If there is no will,

106
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:27,613
the three siblings will equally divide the total inheritance.

107
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:30,813
I see, who could the perp be?

108
00:06:30,814 --> 00:06:32,713
What's with you, Dad?

109
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:35,113
Conan is our first priority!

110
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:36,713
I know!

111
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:41,213
That hearse seems to be the only one that left here today.

112
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:44,213
And, I phoned the crematory

113
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:46,313
and was told that they should have arrived already,

114
00:06:46,314 --> 00:06:47,913
but are still not there.

115
00:06:47,914 --> 00:06:50,614
Huh? What does that mean?

116
00:06:51,714 --> 00:06:53,513
Where are you now, Edogawa?

117
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,013
Where am I?

118
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,314
I wish I knew.

119
00:06:58,614 --> 00:07:00,213
It stopped again.

120
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:02,513
-Again? -Yeah.

121
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:05,813
This car's been stopping and moving slowly

122
00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:07,913
at about one minute intervals from about a while ago.

123
00:07:07,914 --> 00:07:10,813
Maybe they're late because they're stopping by places

124
00:07:10,814 --> 00:07:14,113
where the deceased had connections with.

125
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:15,114
"Karahashi Group"

126
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:17,113
From big businesses to small local factories,

127
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:20,513
the chairman was a popular man.

128
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:22,313
Places he had connections with...

129
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:25,713
You mean like the branches and business partners of the Karahashi Group?

130
00:07:25,714 --> 00:07:28,513
-Yes. -Check that out immediately!

131
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,413
I'll head directly to the crematory.

132
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:31,913
In that case,

133
00:07:31,914 --> 00:07:34,513
we can easily beat them there!

134
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:37,213
Hello, Inspector.

135
00:07:37,214 --> 00:07:38,413
Conan!

136
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:40,313
Please may we get there in time!

137
00:07:40,314 --> 00:07:42,614
Can't you go faster, mister?

138
00:07:46,714 --> 00:07:51,414
"Beika Funeral Hall"

139
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:58,314
All right, we made it in time!

140
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:01,013
But...

141
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,814
something's not right.

142
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:10,413
This is Mouri.

143
00:08:10,414 --> 00:08:11,713
This is Asada.

144
00:08:11,714 --> 00:08:15,813
Just as I thought, the chairman's hearse stopped over

145
00:08:15,814 --> 00:08:17,813
at one of the branches.

146
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:19,813
However, since today is a holiday,

147
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:22,113
traffic could be bad,

148
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:25,513
so they canceled and decided to head for the crematory.

149
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:26,914
What?

150
00:08:28,114 --> 00:08:29,713
Judging from the time,

151
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:32,113
I think it's about time that they arrive.

152
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:33,914

154

Isn't that it?

00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:43,214
"Beika Funeral Hall Annex"

156
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:51,314

00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:06,513

Please wait!

159
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,113
Conan!

160
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:10,514
-Conan! -Conan!

163
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,713
"Mitsuyo Karahashi (32), Eldest Daughter" -He's a third-rate detective.

164
00:09:19,714 --> 00:09:22,013
Conan is in the...

165
00:09:22,014 --> 00:09:25,014
A child is trapped in the coffin!

166
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:30,414
You look to have an idea of what I mean.

167

Don't be ridiculous!

168
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:34,713
There's no such thing like that here!

169
00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:37,213
Yeah! There'd never be something like that here!

170
00:09:37,214 --> 00:09:41,313
Okay then, please open the coffin for us.

171
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,313
I was waiting for you, Inspector!

172
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:46,413
I'm from MPD First Investigation Division.

173
00:09:46,414 --> 00:09:50,013
This is an emergency because this could be an abduction case.

174
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:51,313
Officer Takagi and Chiba!

175
00:09:51,314 --> 00:09:52,514
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

176
00:09:57,314 --> 00:09:58,813
Just because you're with the police,

177
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:00,013
it doesn't give you the right to do something like this.

178
00:10:00,014 --> 00:10:03,013
Is there any reason why you don't want to comply?

179
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:04,914
No. Not at all.

180
00:10:07,914 --> 00:10:10,514
Conan is under this wooden board.

181
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:13,213
-Excuse us. -Excuse us.

182
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:14,914
"Beika Funeral Hall Annex"

183
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:23,114
He's not here!

184
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:26,113
Rather,

185
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:30,113
this coffin is not double-bottomed.

186
00:10:30,114 --> 00:10:31,913
What?

187
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:33,814
No way.

188
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,170
What is the meaning of this, Mr. Mouri?

189
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:42,870
Well, that can't be.

190
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:45,470
Hey, just what's going on?

191
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:48,270
How would we know?

192
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:51,070
Rather, isn't this a problem?

193
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:53,570
I hope you're taking responsibility for this.

194
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:57,570
Well, we'll get to that later.

195
00:10:57,571 --> 00:10:58,870
Edogawa?

196
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:00,170
Where are you, Edogawa?

197
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:01,971
Edogawa!

198
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,170
You can't get through?

199
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:07,570
Where'd he go?

200
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:09,270
Conan.

201
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:12,870
Haibara? Haibara!

202
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:14,070
Darn.

203
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:16,371
Where the hell is this car moving along to?

204
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,470
Gee, this jalopy.

205
00:11:23,471 --> 00:11:26,271
I've wasted a lot of time on the road.

206
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:33,370
I see.

207
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:34,771
Which means that maybe...

208
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:41,470
Haibara, can you hear me?

209
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:43,370
What?

210
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:46,670
A different car, a hearse?

211
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:49,870
Yep. She says Conan told her so.

212
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:53,870
The car was probably parked in the basement parking of the funeral hall.

213
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:57,170
What? Where'd they go?

214
00:11:57,171 --> 00:11:58,570
Inspector!

215
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:00,471
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

216
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:08,271
Hello, is this the funeral hall?

217
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,770
No, you don't!

218
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:14,470
Where are you going?

219
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:16,770
-Officer Chiba! -Yes, sir!

220
00:12:16,771 --> 00:12:18,370
We'll have to ask you to stay here

221
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,271
until we get a hold of the situation.

222
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:29,270
Inspector! There was another hearse after all.

223
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:30,770
Really?

224
00:12:30,771 --> 00:12:33,470
Something about this morning,

225
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:37,070
an old type hearse that was to be scrapped

226
00:12:37,071 --> 00:12:40,070
seems to have been parked in the basement parking.

227
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:41,470
I thought so.

228
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:43,570
Which scrap yard?

229
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:46,470
It seems that the person in charge is day off today.

230
00:12:46,471 --> 00:12:48,271
Can't you find out?

231
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,670
Hello, Ai?

232
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:55,570
Where are you headed for?

233
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:56,870
What?

234
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:59,470
You're going after the hearse that Conan's on?

235
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:00,871
What?

236
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:07,270
I see.

237
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:09,571
This car was to be scrapped.

238
00:13:11,071 --> 00:13:14,870
We just turned right.

239
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:16,870
Then a left right away.

240
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:18,971
Go straight.

241
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:23,770
Then a left again.

242
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:25,670
Turn right, then left.

243
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,370
Go straight, then left again.

244
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:29,870
Got that?

245
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:32,170
We're counting on you!

246
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:34,670
Right, that's why all the other things that were to be scrapped

247
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:38,270
like the incense, dry ice, cardboard boxes and the paulownia box

248
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:40,770
were loaded in that car too.

249
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:45,970
You weren't locked up in the bottom of a coffin.

250
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:49,970
What seemed to be the car stopping over and slowing down at times...

251
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:53,370
The engine not working right because the hearse was a jalopy.

252
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:55,870
It was only a coincidence.

253
00:13:55,871 --> 00:14:00,970
And so this was what was behind this case.

254
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:04,370
I'm starting to get the picture of this case.

255
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:10,270
Back then, over there, there were several people.

256
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:11,970
I see.

257
00:14:11,971 --> 00:14:13,470
And that was...

258
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:14,670
What?

259
00:14:14,671 --> 00:14:17,970
But they have alibis.

260
00:14:17,971 --> 00:14:20,071
That's probably...

261
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:25,671
"In use" -And in the meantime...

262
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:28,171
They met each other at the scene.

263
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:36,371
A safe cracker?

264
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:51,571
Yeah, no doubt about it.

265
00:14:53,171 --> 00:14:54,671
It stopped.

266
00:14:56,471 --> 00:14:57,971
A pedestrian crossing.

267
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:03,170
After leaving the funeral hall,

268
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:04,670
you go through a tunnel.

269
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:07,170
Take a right, left and another left.

270
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:09,771
Up ahead there should be a pedestrian crossing.

271
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:13,670
It's quite a distance away.

272
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:14,971
It's started moving.

273
00:15:20,071 --> 00:15:21,570
It's a railroad crossing.

274
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,271
A railroad crossing?

275
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:27,270
Railroad crossing...

276
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:28,670
This one!

277
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:30,771
I've figured out where they're headed!

278
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:36,570
All right!

279
00:15:36,571 --> 00:15:38,871
I can cut the rope with this!

280
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:43,271
It stopped again.

281
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:49,370
No, he turned the engine off.

282
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:51,271
Which means this is...

283
00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:55,470
They're headed for the scrapyard in Kuriniji-cho!

284
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:56,671
Hurry!

285
00:15:59,371 --> 00:16:00,371
Huh?

286
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:16,971
I did it!

287
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:29,670
Conan?

288
00:16:29,671 --> 00:16:31,870
Where are you?

289
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:33,471
Over there!

290
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:38,970
Oh, no.

291
00:16:38,971 --> 00:16:40,671
Conan!

292
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:44,571
Conan...

293
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,671
Stop the machine!

294
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:52,071
The pressing machine! Stop it!

295
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:54,471
Please stop the machine!

296
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:00,270
Were we too late?

297
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:03,470
No... No way!

298
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:07,270
No.

299
00:17:07,271 --> 00:17:08,571
No way!

300
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:17,570
No way...

301
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,670
No!

302
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:24,070
No. It can't be! Conan!

303
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:25,570
Conan...

304
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:28,170
I'll treat you to 10 bowls of eels over rice,

305
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:30,670
so come back to life!

306
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:34,171
I could never eat that much.

307
00:17:40,271 --> 00:17:41,871
Genta!

308
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:45,270
Conan!

309
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:47,271
-Conan! -Conan!

310
00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:02,871
That was close.

311
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:09,970
Now!

312
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:11,671
I've got to do it, now!

313
00:18:23,171 --> 00:18:24,470
Where's the will?

314
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:27,970
Don't tell me it was scrapped together with the hearse?

315
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:30,071
-Oh, no! -Where's Conan?

316
00:18:33,771 --> 00:18:38,971
Hore-ara-hire. What happened to the will?

317
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:43,470
The will was found?

318
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:45,070
Really?

319
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:46,471
Wait.

320
00:18:50,771 --> 00:18:52,671
The Sleeping Kogoro?

321
00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:59,071
-Conan! -Yes!

322
00:19:01,271 --> 00:19:04,071
-Here you go! -Thank you.

323
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:09,170
This is the will.

324
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:13,171
The newest one that the chairman rewrote.

325
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,370
Well, well.

326
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:19,970
How disappointing it is, Eisuke?

327
00:19:19,971 --> 00:19:21,470
What?

328
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,470
You stepped on gum, didn't you?

329
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:25,071
Gum?

330
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:30,270
The smell of it

331
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:34,271
and stickiness is all over my phone, you see.

332
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:40,670
That's...

333
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,470
Kozo and Mitsuyo,

334
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:46,071
you two were there too.

335
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:51,670
You counted on us to assume that siblings who hated each other

336
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:55,370
wouldn't verify each other's alibis.

337
00:19:55,371 --> 00:19:58,370
That's a pretty classic trick.

338
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:00,270
Where's the proof?

339
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:03,470
Right. Where's the proof?

340
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:05,870
Inspector.

341
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,170
Please check for fingerprints on the will.

342
00:20:09,171 --> 00:20:11,670
If my deduction is correct,

343
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:14,770
besides the fingerprints of the deceased, Mr. Asada and Conan,

344
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:17,871
the fingerprints of the three in question should also be detected.

345
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:21,371
Is that true?

346
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:27,470
Since they planned to get rid of the will or rewrite it anyway,

347
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:29,570
they touched it with their bare hands.

348
00:20:29,571 --> 00:20:34,370
Because they wanted to confirm the contents as soon as possible,

349
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:35,871
Isn't that right?

350
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,471
It's most likely that

351
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,070
the three of you colluded on the condition

352
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:44,170
that the fortune be divided equally among you

353
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:47,270
or be rewritten in your favor.

354
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:50,470
You hid the will in an unused hearse together with Conan

355
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:54,270
who you eventually planned to release.

356
00:20:54,271 --> 00:20:59,071
But the thing was, you didn't know it was going to be scrapped today.

357
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:03,570
It's all Dad's fault!

358
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:06,570
He's got to be kidding.

359
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:10,070
To want to give his entire assets over to his secretary.

360
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:12,570
Rather, his lover!

361
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,971
How can you forgive something like that?

362
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:19,770
You mean...

363
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:24,671
you dare risk the life of a child, of Conan just for something like that?

364
00:21:27,771 --> 00:21:31,071
You're the ones who can't be forgiven!

365
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:43,271
Ran...

366
00:23:04,171 --> 00:23:09,770
Pops was informed by Attorney Asada later that the inheritance

367
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:13,070
was handed over to the woman secretary,

368
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:16,071
but she donated it entirely to a charity organization.

369
00:23:17,071 --> 00:23:19,370
It must've been tough

370
00:23:19,371 --> 00:23:22,471
being locked up in a dark, cramped place like that.

371
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:25,870
Can you go to the restroom alone at night?

372
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,470
Would you like me to go with you?

373
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:31,870
I can handle it, Ran!

374
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:34,170
Come on, you don't be shy.

375
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:36,070
You can lay your head on my shoulder.

376
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:37,870
You got to be kidding?

377
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:41,071
I'm in high school, you know.

378
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:45,470
"Next Episode" -Are you asking me to search for an alien?

379
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:49,270
Yes! I definitely saw it with my own eyes.

380
00:23:49,271 --> 00:23:51,770
An Unidentified Flying Object.

381
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:53,270
UFO?

382
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:55,470
This place is off limits!

383
00:23:55,471 --> 00:23:56,870
Mr. Mouri?

384
00:23:56,871 --> 00:24:00,470
And? What is that man saying?

385
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:03,370
That an alien who came down from the UFO

386
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:07,070
killed Mr. Nakatsu while afloat in the air.

387
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,470
Next Conan,

388
00:24:08,471 --> 00:24:12,371
"Chiba's Difficult UFO Case (Part 1)"
