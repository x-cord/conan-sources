1
00:00:01,258 --> 00:00:02,957
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,958 --> 00:00:04,657
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:06,157
The truth in this difficult case becomes clear.

4
00:00:06,158 --> 00:00:08,257
Kisaki and Kujo clash in court!

5
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,857
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:11,557
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:13,958
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:57,977
The hot springs.

9
00:01:57,978 --> 00:02:00,677
I haven't been to one for so long

10
00:02:00,678 --> 00:02:03,987
and the autumn colors must be lovely this time of year.

11
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:05,378
Yes, that's right!

12
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:10,113
I think this open air bath would be great!

13
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:13,013
They say the water here is good for the complexion!

14
00:02:13,014 --> 00:02:18,113
Mom, you need to take off from work once in a while and relax.

15
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:20,113
You're right.

16
00:02:20,114 --> 00:02:21,313
Ms. Kuriyama.

17
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:24,613
How's my schedule for next month?

18
00:02:24,614 --> 00:02:28,313
The conclusion of the trial you're working on now

19
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,213
is slated for next week,

20
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:32,513
so all you have to do is decide whether you want to take the "duty case".

21
00:02:32,514 --> 00:02:35,313
Oh, that's right. I've forgotten about that.

22
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:37,113
Can you get me the files on that?

23
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:38,214
Okay.

24
00:02:40,214 --> 00:02:42,113
What's a "duty case"?

25
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:44,613
Well... when a person is financially

26
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:46,913
or otherwise unable to hire a lawyer,

27
00:02:46,914 --> 00:02:49,713
the court appoints one,

28
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:51,513
but if no one will take the case,

29
00:02:51,514 --> 00:02:54,713
then they'll decide on a "duty" public defender to take the case.

30
00:02:54,714 --> 00:02:56,313
I see.

31
00:02:56,314 --> 00:02:58,314
-Here it is. -Thank you.

32
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:02,513
I've just taken a fast look

33
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:05,613
but I don't understand why no one would take this case.

34
00:03:05,614 --> 00:03:09,313
I think this case is defendable.

35
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,013
I guess it's because of the prosecutor.

36
00:03:12,014 --> 00:03:13,313
Who would that be?

37
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:17,114
Ms. Kujo's the prosecutor on this case.

38
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:21,813
I see.

39
00:03:21,814 --> 00:03:24,214
So it's the prosecution office's Madonna.

40
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:31,513
"Court Battle 2: Kisaki vs Kujo (Part 1)"

41
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:33,013
What are you going to do?

42
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:36,214
Shall I tell them you're busy and turn them down?

43
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:39,813
Excuse me, Ms. Kisaki.

44
00:03:39,814 --> 00:03:42,513
What is the case about?

45
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,113
It happened about a month ago,

46
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:47,513
an office in a building in Haido was broken into

47
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:50,513
and the company president was found dead.

48
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:53,813
From the fingerprints and evidence found in the room,

49
00:03:53,814 --> 00:03:57,913
the defendant, a confirmed criminal with a record, became the suspect.

50
00:03:57,914 --> 00:04:02,613
It sounds like an open and shut case.

51
00:04:02,614 --> 00:04:04,013
Yes, it does.

52
00:04:04,014 --> 00:04:06,013
The defendant has confessed that he broke in

53
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:07,713
thinking the office was empty

54
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:12,113
but when the victim found him and they struggled, he hit him.

55
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:15,013
The problem is the charge on the indictment.

56
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:16,613
What's the charge?

57
00:04:16,614 --> 00:04:20,313
He's being indicted for burglary and murder.

58
00:04:20,314 --> 00:04:21,613
Murder?

59
00:04:21,614 --> 00:04:25,313
But this case sounds more like accidental death, doesn't it?

60
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:26,613
Yes.

61
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:28,413
I don't think Prosecutor Kujo

62
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:31,414
would make a mistake as big as this.

63
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:34,013
Ms. Kuriyama,

64
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:36,313
I have the prosecutor's report and the deposition

65
00:04:36,314 --> 00:04:38,113
but the crime scene investigation report isn't here,

66
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:39,813
could you have them send it up?

67
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:42,313
And I'll need the coroner's report too.

68
00:04:42,314 --> 00:04:43,613
Okay.

69
00:04:43,614 --> 00:04:45,713
Mom.

70
00:04:45,714 --> 00:04:48,313
Sorry, Ran. As you can see,

71
00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:50,513
I won't be able to go to the hot springs with you, maybe another time.

72
00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:51,914
Good grief.

73
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:56,013
"Tokyo Prison."

74
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:58,013
Let me ask you one more time.

75
00:04:58,014 --> 00:04:59,813
On the night of the crime,

76
00:04:59,814 --> 00:05:01,213
"Takashi Inoue (55)" -you entered the Otsu Realty Office.

77
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:03,513
"Takashi Inoue (55)" -on the second floor of the Nomoto Building

78
00:05:03,514 --> 00:05:05,513
by breaking the window.

79
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,413
You searched the office

80
00:05:07,414 --> 00:05:10,713
and then tried to open the safe in the president's office.

81
00:05:10,714 --> 00:05:14,213
But the president, Mr. Otsu, unexpectedly returned to the office,

82
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,813
he saw you

83
00:05:16,814 --> 00:05:18,713
and you two fought.

84
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:26,313
You then hit the victim on the head with an ashtray

85
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:29,313
causing his death.

86
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:31,513
Is that correct?

87
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:32,913
Yeah.

88
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:35,713
What happened to the money that was in the safe?

89
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:37,013
How should I know?

90
00:05:37,014 --> 00:05:38,713
But according to the employees' statements,

91
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:43,213
they had just closed a deal and there was 12 million yen in the safe

92
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:45,113
but it disappeared.

93
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:48,113
The prosecutor is saying that

94
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:51,113
you took the money after killing Mr. Otsu.

95
00:05:51,114 --> 00:05:54,213
It wasn't me! I'm telling you the truth!

96
00:05:54,214 --> 00:05:57,713
It's true, no money was found in your apartment

97
00:05:57,714 --> 00:06:01,213
but your fingerprints were on the safe

98
00:06:01,214 --> 00:06:04,213
so I don't blame the prosecution for suspecting you, don't you agree?

99
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:07,613
I really didn't take the money and about that person...

100
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:09,213
"That person"?

101
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:11,614
Did you know the victim?

102
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:23,813
How many times did you hit the victim on the head?

103
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:25,113
I don't remember.

104
00:06:25,114 --> 00:06:28,013
Once? Twice?

105
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:29,513
I don't remember.

106
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,213
He surprised me when he walked in, my mind went blank.

107
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:35,013
The coroner's report said

108
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:38,613
the victim received three blows to the head.

109
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:42,913
The third blow was the one that killed him.

110
00:06:42,914 --> 00:06:44,713
Striking him once, is understandable

111
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:46,413
but since there was a second and then a third,

112
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:49,513
could show intent to commit murder.

113
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:51,813
I honestly don't remember.

114
00:06:51,814 --> 00:06:53,413
I see.

115
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,613
Well, I'm on your side

116
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:57,713
so I want you to tell me the truth,

117
00:06:57,714 --> 00:07:02,213
even if it's detrimental to your case, all right?

118
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,013
I just want to make absolutely sure,

119
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:07,713
are you positive you had no intention of killing the victim?

120
00:07:07,714 --> 00:07:09,313
I'm positive.

121
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:10,513
All right.

122
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:14,613
We'll argue our case on that point alone in court.

123
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:16,613
Thank you.

124
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:18,813
"Tokyo Courthouse" -The defendant Takashi Inoue,

125
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:21,213
at approximately 20:30 on the evening of the incident,

126
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:23,313
broke the window to the Otsu Realty Office

127
00:07:23,314 --> 00:07:25,713
on the second floor of the Nomoto Building

128
00:07:25,714 --> 00:07:28,313
located at 2-9 Haido-cho Sanchome.

129
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,913
While he was ransacking the president, Mr. Toshiyuki Otsu's office,

130
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:35,413
the victim, Mr. Otsu, returned and saw him.

131
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,313
The defendant then used the weapon he had

132
00:07:37,314 --> 00:07:38,713
to threaten the victim

133
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:41,713
and forced the victim to open the safe in the office.

134
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:44,813
The defendant then struck the victim three times

135
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:48,513
on the back of the head causing the victim's death.

136
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:52,613
The defendant then escaped with the 12 million yen in cash

137
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:54,313
which was in the safe.

138
00:07:54,314 --> 00:07:57,513
According to penal code 240,

139
00:07:57,514 --> 00:07:59,413
the prosecution asks the defendant to be sentenced to life imprisonment

140
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:03,213
for burglary and murder.

141
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:05,613
Does the defendant have anything to say

142
00:08:05,614 --> 00:08:07,813
regarding the charges the prosecution has just stated?

143
00:08:07,814 --> 00:08:09,813
Do you wish to deny the charges?

144
00:08:09,814 --> 00:08:13,513
I just broke in to rob the place,

145
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:15,113
I didn't mean to kill anybody.

146
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:16,613
Your honor!

147
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:18,613
The defense may speak.

148
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:21,713
The indictment states my client is guilty of burglary and murder

149
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:23,613
but my client would like to plead not guilty

150
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:26,313
to the charge of murder.

151
00:08:26,314 --> 00:08:29,013
So you're pleading not guilty to burglary and murder, is that correct?

152
00:08:29,014 --> 00:08:31,513
Correct. The defense asks the defendant be charged

153
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:36,413
under penal code 205, accidental death.

154
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:40,313
The defense is challenging the prosecution's indictment,

155
00:08:40,314 --> 00:08:41,813
do you have anything to say?

156
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:44,313
Yes, I do.

157
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:48,213
Could the defendant tell me why he broke into the victim's office?

158
00:08:48,214 --> 00:08:53,113
Well, I was looking for someplace to broke into

159
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:55,413
and it just caught my eye, that's all.

160
00:08:55,414 --> 00:08:59,213
Then you are claiming it was mere coincidence

161
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:03,513
that you broke into the victim's office

162
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:06,313
and that you held no grudge toward Mr. Toshiyuki Otsu, is that correct?

163
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:07,314
Right.

164
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:11,013
I wonder what she's trying to get at.

165
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:15,513
Your honor. The prosecution's line of questioning is unclear!

166
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,013
All right then.

167
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,914
Does the defendant know a woman named Noriko Endo?

168
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:24,013
Well?

169
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:27,613
Don't tell me you've forgotten your only daughter's name?

170
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:30,613
Only daughter?

171
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:31,913
Here it is!

172
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:35,013
When he divorced his wife 20 years ago,

173
00:09:35,014 --> 00:09:37,413
his daughter was 8 years old.

174
00:09:37,414 --> 00:09:40,413
I wonder what that has to do with the case though.

175
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,313
Aren't you going to answer me?

176
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:44,013
Objection!

177
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:48,113
The prosecution is merely trying to confuse the defendant

178
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:52,713
by mentioning a family member's name!

179
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:56,813
Does this daughter have anything to do with the case?

180
00:09:56,814 --> 00:09:57,913
Yes.

181
00:09:57,914 --> 00:10:00,413
Noriko Endo runs a pub in another building

182
00:10:00,414 --> 00:10:03,613
the victim's company manages

183
00:10:03,614 --> 00:10:05,913
and there are rumors that she and the victim, Toshiyuki Otsu,

184
00:10:05,914 --> 00:10:09,613
were involved in a personal relationship.

185
00:10:09,614 --> 00:10:12,113
So you are claiming the defendant had a premeditated motive

186
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:14,513
for breaking into the victim's office, is that correct?

187
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:15,913
Yes.

188
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:17,813
We have proof that the defendant held a grudge

189
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:20,713
against the victim over his daughter.

190
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:24,513
You're wrong! I don't even know the creep!

191
00:10:24,514 --> 00:10:27,413
Would you like to ask her yourself then?

192
00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:29,913
She's in the gallery,

193
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:32,614
we can have her take the witness stand if you'd like.

194
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:38,014
"Noriko Endo (28)" -Dad.

195
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:40,414
Noriko.

196
00:10:43,714 --> 00:10:47,213
So that's the ace that the Madonna had up her sleeve.

197
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:48,713
We are prepared to call Ms. Endo

198
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,814
to the witness stand if necessary.

199
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:08,513
So what the prosecutor said was true?

200
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:12,913
Yes, that man tricked me.

201
00:11:12,914 --> 00:11:16,113
He told me he'd let me have my own business,

202
00:11:16,114 --> 00:11:18,413
then he used me.

203
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:20,713
When did you start communicating with your father?

204
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:24,513
We met two years ago when mother died after an illness,

205
00:11:24,514 --> 00:11:29,213
he'd drop in to my pub every now and then to see me.

206
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:32,414
And you told him about Mr. Otsu?

207
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:37,613
He said he'd get him to pay me consolation money.

208
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,813
This case isn't looking too good.

209
00:11:40,814 --> 00:11:41,913
What do you mean?

210
00:11:41,914 --> 00:11:46,513
Well, if you had a motive and struck the victim three times,

211
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:50,613
no one would believe you didn't mean to kill him.

212
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:52,013
I see.

213
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:55,213
One last question and I'd like you to give me an honest answer.

214
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:59,813
Do you think your father killed Toshiyuki Otsu?

215
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:02,913
No! He may be a good for nothing thief

216
00:12:02,914 --> 00:12:05,913
but he's not capable of murder!

217
00:12:05,914 --> 00:12:08,013
I see.

218
00:12:08,014 --> 00:12:12,214
She's going to have it hard this time.

219
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:27,597
Good grief, dad.

220
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:29,398
Sleeping again?

221
00:12:31,598 --> 00:12:34,097
I always close my eyes when I'm thinking!

222
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:35,997
Who says I was sleeping?

223
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:36,998
I see.

224
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:41,497
So you must've thought of something that would help mom then!

225
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:45,597
Well, you see...

226
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,497
It's her fault for taking a case like this in the first place!

227
00:12:49,498 --> 00:12:52,097
The defendant had a motive for committing murder.

228
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:56,097
Moreover, he left his fingerprints all over the safe's dial.

229
00:12:56,098 --> 00:12:58,997
How in the world can she think she can get him off?

230
00:12:58,998 --> 00:13:03,797
I wonder why his fingerprints were only on the safe's dial though.

231
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:07,597
Easy, he probably wore gloves when he broke in.

232
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:13,597
But he couldn't turn the dial with them on so he took them off!

233
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:15,097
That's when the victim came in,

234
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:16,297
he hit him over the head with the ashtray.

235
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:17,298
If that's how it went,

236
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:20,397
then there should've been fingerprints on the ashtray.

237
00:13:20,398 --> 00:13:23,797
I guess, since he took his gloves off.

238
00:13:23,798 --> 00:13:27,097
But they didn't find any.

239
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,397
Well, he probably wiped them off, that's why!

240
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:31,498
Give those to me!

241
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:34,997
Read this part carefully!

242
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:37,397
It says that there were traces that

243
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:39,997
it'd been wiped with a cloth containing oil!

244
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:43,897
Then why didn't he wipe the safe at the same time too?

245
00:13:43,898 --> 00:13:47,097
Well, that's because he'd just killed someone,

246
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:49,597
he panicked and forgot, he just ran out of there.

247
00:13:49,598 --> 00:13:51,197
I see.

248
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,397
So when did he take the money from the safe?

249
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:57,897
Well, after he killed the victim, he opened the safe one more time.

250
00:13:57,898 --> 00:14:00,697
But you just said he panicked and ran out of there.

251
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:02,097
Well...

252
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:04,997
It just doesn't make any sense.

253
00:14:04,998 --> 00:14:06,097
You're stupid!

254
00:14:06,098 --> 00:14:09,597
Criminals aren't logical, that's why!

255
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,397
What's that supposed to mean? You're just making excuses!

256
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:15,597
Shut up! Kids should mind their own business!

257
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:18,897
Wait a minute dad, where're you going?

258
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:21,197
Play "pachinko".

259
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:22,798
Good grief!

260
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,597
"Things found at the crime scene."

261
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:27,797
"Glass Ashtray, a pair of army cotton gloves"

262
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:29,598
"screw for eyeglasses, golf ball."

263
00:14:47,816 --> 00:14:48,816
Oh, Kogoro...

264
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:50,415
Oh, it's you.

265
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,515
What are you doing here?

266
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,396
I just...

267
00:14:54,772 --> 00:14:57,971
He wanted to see if there was anything he could help you with

268
00:14:57,972 --> 00:14:59,871
so he came to check the scene of the crime.

269
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:01,571
Shut up you little brat!

270
00:15:01,572 --> 00:15:03,371
For a famous private detective,

271
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:04,971
you sure have a lot of free time, don't you?

272
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:06,471
What did you say?

273
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,371
Did you come to check the scene too?

274
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:13,672
That's right. I just got permission from the superintendent.

275
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:17,771
"Takuya Akiyama (56), Superintendent" -Sorry to keep you waiting.

276
00:15:17,772 --> 00:15:19,472
Follow me, it's this way.

277
00:15:21,872 --> 00:15:25,271
Were you the first one to discover the body?

278
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:26,771
That's right, kid.

279
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:29,872
Could you tell me about it in detail?

280
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,271
At about 9 that night,

281
00:15:33,272 --> 00:15:37,072
I was watching a baseball game on TV.

282
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:42,071
Why Mr. Arima?

283
00:15:42,072 --> 00:15:45,271
Did you see the president?

284
00:15:45,272 --> 00:15:50,271
No, nobody was in the office when I made my rounds at 8 pm.

285
00:15:50,272 --> 00:15:51,571
That's strange.

286
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:53,471
When he left my place a little while ago,

287
00:15:53,472 --> 00:15:55,771
he said he was coming back here.

288
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:58,571
Then he must've come in through the emergency exit.

289
00:15:58,572 --> 00:16:01,571
But his office door's locked

290
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:04,171
and I called but there was no answer.

291
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:07,171
Maybe he's at the back, in his office.

292
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:09,971
He forgot his glasses, so I came to give them to him.

293
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:13,171
I hate to ask but can you come with me and open the door?

294
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,672
Sure.

295
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:20,771
Mr. Arima is Mr. Otsu's son-in-law, isn't he?

296
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:24,871
Yes, he runs an Italian restaurant in the neighborhood.

297
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:28,271
And this door was locked, you say?

298
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:32,472
Yes. I used this spare key to get in.

299
00:16:41,272 --> 00:16:43,472
It doesn't look like he's here after all.

300
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,471
Father, are you in there?

301
00:16:48,472 --> 00:16:51,371
It's me, Masahiko.

302
00:16:51,372 --> 00:16:53,371
That's strange.

303
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:55,172
What's this? There's somebody inside!

304
00:17:00,272 --> 00:17:01,671
This is bad!

305
00:17:01,672 --> 00:17:02,871
What is it?

306
00:17:02,872 --> 00:17:05,171
Somebody's getting beaten up in there!

307
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:07,071
What?

308
00:17:07,072 --> 00:17:08,971
The key! Open this door!

309
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:11,471
Only Mr. Otsu has the key to this office!

310
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:13,572
Darn it! Get out of the way!

311
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:18,286
Father!

312
00:17:19,686 --> 00:17:22,385
Father, please hang in there!

313
00:17:22,386 --> 00:17:24,485
Mr. Akiyama, call an ambulance!

314
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:25,686
Oh, right!

315
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,485
Is that the office where it happened?

316
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:38,485
Yes.

317
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:41,585
Hey, this door's locked.

318
00:17:41,586 --> 00:17:44,785
Mr. Arima has the key to that room.

319
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:46,785
There he is!

320
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:50,385
Mr. Arima, this is Ms. Kisaki,

321
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:52,085
the lawyer I told you about on the telephone.

322
00:17:52,086 --> 00:17:54,385
And I'm Kogoro Mouri, a private detective.

323
00:17:54,386 --> 00:17:56,985
"Masahiko Arima (35)" -You're that famous detective!

324
00:17:56,986 --> 00:17:58,685
Yes, I suppose so.

325
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:01,585
Mr. Arima, I'm sorry we had to bother you at work.

326
00:18:01,586 --> 00:18:05,085
We'd like to take a look around your father-in-law's office.

327
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:08,085
Isn't anybody using this office?

328
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:09,086
No.

329
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:12,285
The police said we could

330
00:18:12,286 --> 00:18:15,785
but since father was killed in here so tragically,

331
00:18:15,786 --> 00:18:19,285
I haven't decided what to do with it yet.

332
00:18:19,286 --> 00:18:22,985
Go ahead, I've left it exactly as the police left it.

333
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:23,986
Thank you.

334
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:38,085
By the way, Mr. Arima,

335
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:41,185
where was the victim's body lying?

336
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:44,585
Let's see, right about here in front of the safe,

337
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:47,485
he was lying clutching his head.

338
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:49,585
I see.

339
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,885
I've got it!

340
00:18:51,886 --> 00:18:53,585
What do you mean?

341
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:58,785
I bet Mr. Otsu caught Inoue trying to open the safe.

342
00:18:58,786 --> 00:19:01,285
The defendant confessed to that in the very beginning.

343
00:19:01,286 --> 00:19:02,985
What's important is what happened after.

344
00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:06,285
Inoue was hiding a knife or something,

345
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:09,985
he threatened the victim and forced him to open the safe.

346
00:19:09,986 --> 00:19:13,185
When the safe was opened,

347
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:16,385
he hit the victim with the ashtray from behind.

348
00:19:16,386 --> 00:19:19,485
You're not implying the defendant was lying, are you?

349
00:19:19,486 --> 00:19:22,385
Well, I guess you could say I am.

350
00:19:22,386 --> 00:19:23,685
How can you expect to defend a client

351
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:26,885
if you don't believe him!

352
00:19:26,886 --> 00:19:28,585
You can say what you want

353
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:31,685
but that "Madonna" is going to fry you in court!

354
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:32,786
What's that?

355
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:37,485
Wait a minute.

356
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:38,686
It can't be...

357
00:19:39,986 --> 00:19:44,385
Hey, is that the window you saw the killer through, sir?

358
00:19:44,386 --> 00:19:46,486
-That's right. -I see.

359
00:19:53,086 --> 00:19:56,285
Hey, Conan! What're you up to?

360
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:57,685
Pops Kogoro,

361
00:19:57,686 --> 00:20:00,485
could you stand in front of the safe one more time for me?

362
00:20:00,486 --> 00:20:03,686
Gosh. Now what?

363
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:06,885
Here?

364
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:08,986
Hold it right there!

365
00:20:10,886 --> 00:20:13,185
I knew it!

366
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:14,186
I don't get it.

367
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:19,185
The partition is blocking the way, I can't see you from here!

368
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:20,585
What did you say?

369
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,985
Mr. Akiyama, what is the meaning of this?

370
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:26,785
Well, I wasn't looking over there.

371
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:28,285
I was only looking at the person's shadow reflected

372
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:29,885
on this wall over here.

373
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:32,685
Did you say the reflection on the wall?

374
00:20:32,686 --> 00:20:36,185
Yes. There weren't any lights on in the room that night

375
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:39,885
and the neon lights from outside the window came in.

376
00:20:39,886 --> 00:20:42,285
That's how I saw the killer's shadow.

377
00:20:42,286 --> 00:20:47,285
He hit Mr. Otsu over and over again.

378
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:51,085
Besides, I heard Mr. Otsu fall after that,

379
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:53,185
I'm positive about that!

380
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:54,985
Let me clarify one point,

381
00:20:54,986 --> 00:20:59,485
you didn't actually see the defendant strike the victim, did you?

382
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:01,085
But Ms. Kisaki

383
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:03,885
I don't see how much difference it makes.

384
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:06,285
The defendant himself has confessed to hitting my father-in-law, right?

385
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:07,785
That's where you're wrong Mr. Arima.

386
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:10,485
There's a big difference in actually seeing the beating

387
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:13,685
and seeing the shadow of someone being beaten!

388
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:17,785
Besides, until the defendant is found guilty in court,

389
00:21:17,786 --> 00:21:21,685
he is presumed innocent!

390
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:26,085
Unfortunately, most people forget that fact.

391
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:28,085
I'm sorry then.

392
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,485
Excuse me, sir.

393
00:21:29,486 --> 00:21:30,486
What is it?

394
00:21:30,487 --> 00:21:33,285
This clock isn't working.

395
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:38,885
The late president won that in a golf tournament

396
00:21:38,886 --> 00:21:40,685
he just left it there for decoration,

397
00:21:40,686 --> 00:21:43,985
he never used it.

398
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:46,185
Mr. Arima, I need to ask you.

399
00:21:46,186 --> 00:21:48,285
Yes, what is it?

400
00:21:48,286 --> 00:21:51,285
Was there anyone besides the victim

401
00:21:51,286 --> 00:21:54,485
who knew the combination to the safe?

402
00:21:54,486 --> 00:21:56,485
No, he was the only one.

403
00:21:56,486 --> 00:21:58,785
He was a man one operation,

404
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:01,985
he didn't even tell the accountant.

405
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:07,285
Watch it! Stop wandering around!

406
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:08,985
What's this?

407
00:22:08,986 --> 00:22:11,285
That's it, I've got it now!

408
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:13,985
I've solved the mystery behind this case.

409
00:22:13,986 --> 00:22:15,685
The silhouette of something being hit

410
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:18,385
that Mr. Akiyama said he saw

411
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:20,985
and the sound of something falling,

412
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:24,285
everything can be this trick will explain everything

413
00:22:24,286 --> 00:22:27,485
and the only one who could've have set it up is

414
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:29,386
that person!

415
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:00,985
"Next Episode" -This restaurant looks fancy

416
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:02,485
but the pasta isn't very good, right?

417
00:24:02,486 --> 00:24:03,685
You're right.

418
00:24:03,686 --> 00:24:06,286
The olive oil is a little heavy.

419
00:24:09,186 --> 00:24:10,186
What is this?

420
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:13,985
I set things up just like Pops Kogoro told me to.

421
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,785
Set things up?

422
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,685
Are you saying he knows who the murderer is?

423
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:21,927
Yes, he said he'd explain everything in court.

424
00:24:22,324 --> 00:24:23,723
