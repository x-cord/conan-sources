1
00:00:10,547 --> 00:00:14,903
Well... So many balls came out today. What a great haul!

2
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:16,717
I'm super lucky!

3
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:19,887
I'm going to surprise Ran out of her wits for despising me

4
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:22,757
for playing pachinko all the time!

5
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:28,347
I'm home! The Pachinko King is home!

6
00:00:30,087 --> 00:00:31,297
Hey!

7
00:00:33,217 --> 00:00:34,737
A letter for me?

8
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:38,857
What's this? "I'm going to the hospital."

9
00:00:39,357 --> 00:00:42,257
"Why don't you keep your cell phone switched on?"

10
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:43,377
"Ran."

11
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:44,877
Cell phone?

12
00:00:45,897 --> 00:00:48,437
Oh, no! It's switched off...

13
00:00:50,127 --> 00:00:54,127
34 missed calls and 16 text mails?

14
00:00:54,357 --> 00:00:56,127
What?

15
00:00:56,677 --> 00:01:00,967
Mom fell ill at work and is going to have surgery from now!

16
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:03,757
I'm at Haido Central Hospital so come quick!

17
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:04,877
Ran.

18
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,407
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

19
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,357
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

20
00:01:11,477 --> 00:01:13,247
Coincidental encounter with Amuro at the Central Hospital.

21
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:15,447
Four ladies involved in a tea party incident.

22
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:16,867
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:16,987 --> 00:01:18,597
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:18,717 --> 00:01:21,067
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:04,588
"An Awkward Tea Party (Part 1)"

26
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:13,308
Eri!

27
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,745
Eri!

28
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,710
Eri...

29
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,390
Eri...

30
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,510
"Eri Mouri."

31
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,140
Eri!

32
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,860
What's with you making so much noise?

33
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,270
What do you mean that you're having surgery?

34
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,600
It's mere appendicitis.

35
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,030
The surgery finished a while ago, I'm out of sedation and just got up.

36
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,640
It's mere appendicitis.

37
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,110
What do you mean mere?

38
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,410
Where and what were you doing with your cell phone switched off?

39
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,010
I'm sure you were either at the horse races,

40
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,130
playing mahjong or at the pachinko parlor, right?

41
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,680
Idiot... I was working...

42
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,880
Playing pachinko, right?

43
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,790
Because your clothes got a strange looking wrinkle on your jacket.

44
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,060
That goes to show you were sitting for a long time in a chair, right?

45
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,390
On, no, well you see...

46
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,890
Besides, you had your cell phone switched off

47
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,410
because you were in a noisy place

48
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,610
where you couldn't hear the phone anyway, right?

49
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,410
And Pops, you don't like to have your cell phone on vibration

50
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,410
because it doesn't feel good.

51
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,660
And see! You've got a pachinko ball

52
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,910
stuck between your shoelace!

53
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,420
So, you were at the pachinko parlor after all!

54
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,490
That's amazing, Conan!

55
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,200
I just happened to be watching a detective story that went just like this.

56
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,880
I see.

57
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,140
So you were playing pachinko while I was going through a lot.

58
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:48,079
What?

59
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:52,020
Actually I just went to kill time for a while

60
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,509
but I happened to hit the jackpot that doesn't happen everyday you see.

61
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,280
So you go on and let out what you have to too and get discharged soon!

62
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,820
Oh, see...

63
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,678
they say that when you get your appendix taken out,

64
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:08,330
you're ready to be discharged once you fart, right?

65
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:14,240
I hope you don't think you created a fancy pun just now.

66
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,900
Well, I thought it was quite a pun.

67
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,450
Get out of here! You goofy detective!

68
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,570
I tell you...

69
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,310
I just came over because I was worried and she gets all worked up...

70
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,980
I don't blame her...

71
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,650
Aren't you Mr. Mouri?

72
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,940
What are you doing in a place like this?

73
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,940
Bourbon?

74
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,570
-Are you ill? -Well... My wife, you see...

75
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,690
Why?

76
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,930
Why is a member of the Black Organization here at Haido Central Hospital?

77
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,580
Don't tell me that... It can't be... Don't tell me that...

78
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,490
What brings you here?

79
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,420
I heard that an acquaintance of mine was hospitalized so I came to visit

80
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,840
but I guess I didn't make it in time...

81
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,600
The nurses mentioned that you've been here before, Conan.

82
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,800
Do you happen to know?

83
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,100
A man called Rikumichi Kusuda?

84
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,360
Who's that? No.

85
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,340
I lent that man some money and I want it back.

86
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,870
-Are you sure you don't know him? -Yes.

87
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,640
You're really something.

88
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,510
Excuse me...

89
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,941
Do you know an in patient called Rikumichi Kusuda?

90
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:42,451
"Kazuki Beppu (41)" -Mr. Rikumichi Kusuda?

91
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,000
I wonder... What kind of person is he? How old is he?

92
00:06:46,254 --> 00:06:48,863
"Tokie Happo (42)" -Do you have his picture or something?

93
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,250
-Oh, no... Never mind already... -Are you sure?

94
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,110
How about you, Mr. Mouri?

95
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,220
What would you do if somebody suddenly gave you a name

96
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,820
and asked if you knew him?

97
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,860
Well... I would do the same as they did...

98
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,652
That's right.

99
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:09,945
Most people are not really sure whether they remember something correctly.

100
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,370
That's why before they say no,

101
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,720
they want to know other information

102
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,620
besides the name of the person that is being sought.

103
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,890
That's why you're really something, Conan!

104
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,820
You were confident you didn't know that person just by hearing his name.

105
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,840
Don't take what a kid says seriously...

106
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,946
There are millions of people you've met

107
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:33,214
but don't know their names.

108
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:34,730
There are also those that you only know

109
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,480
-by their nicknames too. -Three! Two! One!

110
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,940
Zero!

111
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,030
-Mommy, the elevator's here! -Okay.

112
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,550
Hurry, hurry!

113
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,830
-What's wrong? -Oh, no.

114
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,510
My nickname's also Zero, so I thought somebody called me...

115
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,210
Why, Zero? Your name's Tohru, right?

116
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,840
Tohru in Japanese means transparent, in other words, nil.

117
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,630
Therefore, Zero...

118
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,350
That's how children tend to make nicknames after all.

119
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,520
Rikumichi Kusuda?

120
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:23,352
What about that person?

121
00:08:23,472 --> 00:08:27,062
Somebody asked me about him in the corridor a while ago.

122
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:29,382
"Juri Kosaka (42)" -I don't know that person either.

123
00:08:29,532 --> 00:08:30,722
I'm staying in an individual unit

124
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:34,682
and I don't have much opportunity to talk to other patients, you see...

125
00:08:34,852 --> 00:08:38,792
Congratulations! I heard you'll be discharged tomorrow!

126
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:42,182
-Yes. -I wish you'd have told me.

127
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:44,692
If so, I wouldn't have had to come see you, right?

128
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:47,072
-Thanks for waiting! -Oh, Reina!

129
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:49,622
"Reina Suto (42)" -You both are here!

130
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,622
Okay then, let's have a tea party!

131
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:55,352
-I just went and got some hot water too! -Why not?

132
00:08:55,472 --> 00:08:59,622
Would you please take three tea cups out of that cabinet, please?

133
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:01,232
Is three enough?

134
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:04,512
I have my own cup, you see.

135
00:09:05,572 --> 00:09:08,402
Oh, new teacups?

136
00:09:08,522 --> 00:09:11,738
-Is it okay to use these? -Yes.

137
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:16,832
I get rid of the tea stains using baking soda, so they just look new.

138
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:19,282
You're really scrupulous, after all.

139
00:09:19,402 --> 00:09:21,652
I bought lemon too!

140
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:25,402
You still liked lemons.

141
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:29,082
I wonder if the teabags that I bought when coming to visit today are okay?

142
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:32,422
As to that. There are so many here already...

143
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,389
Why don't we try drinking and comparing various kinds of tea?

144
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:37,926
Sounds great!

145
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:40,722
This is a real girls' tea party, isn't it?

146
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:43,792
I guess you could call it an advance discharge party.

147
00:09:44,592 --> 00:09:49,052
Your wife had acute appendicitis?

148
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,802
Yeah... I got all worked up for nothing.

149
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:55,472
But they say it's dangerous to take appendicitis lightly.

150
00:09:55,592 --> 00:09:57,062
I guess so.

151
00:09:57,312 --> 00:10:00,262
Don't tell me... He's...

152
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:05,662
This picture's so nostalgic.

153
00:10:05,782 --> 00:10:07,532
It was taken during the school festival.

154
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:11,062
Do you keep all your old photos in your cell phone?

155
00:10:11,182 --> 00:10:13,662
Only the ones that I like.

156
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:16,932
Wasn't it during this school festival?

157
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:20,162
That when you got it Sosaki, right, Reina?

158
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:22,242
Who's Sosaki?

159
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:25,212
The most popular guy in our class.

160
00:10:25,332 --> 00:10:26,922
Was there a guy like that?

161
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:31,012
You're really a lucky person, Reina.

162
00:10:31,762 --> 00:10:33,552
I don't think so!

163
00:10:33,972 --> 00:10:38,352
The other day I was almost about to lose a large sum of stocks!

164
00:10:38,642 --> 00:10:42,602
My hubby's a mere nouveau riche!

165
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:45,527
When my son had to take an exam, I thought he had a cold,

166
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,992
but he ended up with influenza, you see...

167
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:50,192
If I didn't realize soon enough, it could've been a tragedy!

168
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:53,632
My life's like walking on tight rope...

169
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:56,372
One mistake and I would've been in the pits.

170
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:13,382
The scream came from this room, right?

171
00:11:13,502 --> 00:11:14,502
Yes.

172
00:11:15,752 --> 00:11:17,352
Is something wrong?

173
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:24,112
-Reina? -Reina!

174
00:11:31,177 --> 00:11:34,507
But poisoning somebody in a hospital.

175
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:38,437
It seems to have been too late by the time the doctor got here.

176
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:41,117
And who is the victim?

177
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:45,817
A resident of Haidocho, Ms. Reina Suto, age 42.

178
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:49,437
It seems she came here today

179
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:51,757
to visit her high school classmate Ms. Juri Kosaka,

180
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:54,707
who had been hospitalized,

181
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:57,327
with her other two classmates.

182
00:11:57,867 --> 00:12:02,337
It seems that Ms. Suto got here before her two other friends though.

183
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,827
The cause of death seems to be suffocation from cyanide poisoning.

184
00:12:08,948 --> 00:12:09,956
Yes.

185
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:14,557
Why were they drinking black tea in the hospital to begin with?

186
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:18,197
It seems that Ms. Kosaka, the patient, like black tea,

187
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:22,477
so every time they got together, they used to have tea parties.

188
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:23,597
I see.

189
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:25,755
Which means that the three knew that

190
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:30,037
they would have a chance to poison the victim.

191
00:12:32,147 --> 00:12:36,157
But the victim seems to have drunk several cups without anything happening.

192
00:12:36,283 --> 00:12:39,207
-It seems she suddenly choked and collapsed. -What?

193
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:43,937
Maybe somebody gave her a poison laced capsule or something beforehand.

194
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:48,317
Which means that this may not be the place the murder was committed.

195
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:51,217
What? It's strange.

196
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,487
-What? -Because see.

197
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,657
There are a lot of pictures in the cell phone that was on the floor here,

198
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,417
but the lady that passed away is holding chopsticks with her right hand!

199
00:13:03,227 --> 00:13:08,017
Hey! Don't go touching the personal effects of the deceased!

200
00:13:08,727 --> 00:13:10,877
But, what's strange about it?

201
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:12,547
We usually hold chopsticks with the right hand.

202
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,327
But, the cup that dropped to the floor and cracked...

203
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:17,477
Take a real close look...

204
00:13:18,337 --> 00:13:22,497
Lipstick is on the right side of the handle of the cup!

205
00:13:23,777 --> 00:13:25,757
This shows that she was drinking tea

206
00:13:25,775 --> 00:13:27,357
while holding the cup with her left hand, right?

207
00:13:27,477 --> 00:13:29,047
True...

208
00:13:29,797 --> 00:13:32,837
But, why was the victim holding it with her left hand?

209
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:36,277
Because her right hand was blocked with something.

210
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:43,347
For example, maybe she was looking at the pictures in her cell phone.

211
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:46,647
-The pictures... -In her cell phone?

212
00:13:46,897 --> 00:13:49,787
Right. When people are absorbed in something,

213
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,287
they seem to get careless with other things.

214
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:53,757
That is, even if the position of their cup

215
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:55,987
or direction of the handle of the cup is changed,

216
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:58,097
they pick it up without a thought.

217
00:13:58,217 --> 00:14:01,234
The perpetrator probably made the victim drink the poison

218
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:03,257
by taking advantage of this mentality

219
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:07,877
by switching her cup with the victim's.

220
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,817
Switched cups?

221
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:17,057
Yes, the risk is lower if the perpetrator puts poison in her own cup

222
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:19,197
and switches it with the victims,

223
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,347
than to try to lace the victim's cup with poison without being noticed.

224
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:25,417
Since they didn't seem to be using a saucer,

225
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:27,857
it would've been easy to move the cups around.

226
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:30,157
Don't you agree, Mr. Mouri?

227
00:14:30,277 --> 00:14:32,397
Oh, yeah... Well, I guess so...

228
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:35,407
Not this detective again.

229
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:38,047
There's no way the cups could've been switched!

230
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:40,677
Only she used lemon.

231
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,747
Besides, take a good look at the color of everyone's tea, will you?

232
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:46,097
Color?

233
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:51,777
All three of them are of different color.

234
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:55,087
From the right, it's brown, blue and yellow.

235
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,767
The one that the victim was drinking was a reddish colored tea.

236
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:03,557
True, that there's no way you could make a mistake then.

237
00:15:03,747 --> 00:15:07,197
At any rate, if the tea was laced with poison,

238
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:11,317
the container or package that the poison was in, should be somewhere.

239
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:14,057
If we check this hospital out thoroughly,

240
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:17,187
-don't you think we'll come up with something? -Yes.

241
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:21,327
The perpetrator could probably have it on her too.

242
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:27,077
So, after the three of you are body checked,

243
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:30,957
you will all be interrogated in separate rooms.

244
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:32,957
Do you understand?

245
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:38,217
Yes, sir...

246
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:41,967
Yes, that's right.

247
00:15:42,357 --> 00:15:45,037
Yes, I served everyone's tea.

248
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:49,477
Although they came to visit me, they were my guests, after all.

249
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:51,357
Well, I served everyone all right,

250
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:55,807
but all I did was put the tea bags in the cups.

251
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:58,987
Then, are you the only one who touched the cups?

252
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:00,757
Oh, no...

253
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:05,997
I had Ms. Happo and Ms. Beppu take the cups out of the cabinet for me.

254
00:16:06,317 --> 00:16:08,055
Which means that all your fingerprints

255
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:12,187
would be on the cup of the victim?

256
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:15,887
But why were so many different types of tea served?

257
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:18,007
Normally, you'd serve only one type, right?

258
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:21,357
Since everyone knew that I like herb tea,

259
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,307
people brought me quite a lot of tea as gifts when visiting.

260
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,167
Since Ms. Happo also brought some,

261
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,055
we decided to drink various kinds of tea and compare drinking them.

262
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:31,875
I see.

263
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:35,257
Since you were the one who suggested drinking various types of tea

264
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:37,857
and served them as well,

265
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:39,757
you would've been most likely among the three of you

266
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:43,077
to serve the poison laced tea, isn't that right?

267
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:45,487
I would never do such a thing!

268
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:48,967
I poured the tea in front of everyone as they watched,

269
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:51,757
and besides, Ms. Suto had drunk almost half of her tea

270
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:53,997
before she collapsed.

271
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:56,877
Besides, as you mentioned a while ago,

272
00:16:56,997 --> 00:17:00,817
if I did switch the poison laced cup with hers,

273
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,437
it would've been apparent in my case.

274
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:05,507
What? Why is that?

275
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:08,357
Because the tea I was drinking back then

276
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:12,057
is called Butterfly Pea herb tea that is blue.

277
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:15,517
So, I'm sure that everyone would've noticed if I made them switched.

278
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:21,777
Ms. Suto was drinking Hibiscus tea, a red colored herb tea.

279
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:26,367
Then do you know what type of tea the other two were drinking?

280
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:27,927
Yes.

281
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,107
Ms. Happo was drinking brown peppermint tea,

282
00:17:32,227 --> 00:17:36,627
and Ms. Beppu was drinking yellow Chamomile tea, I think it was...

283
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:42,877
I was drinking Peppermint.

284
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,317
I thought it was going to be a green colored tea,

285
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:48,557
but was thrown off when it was brown.

286
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:51,767
I mean, they say peppermint green too, right.

287
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:56,227
Juri who is knowledgeable about tea was chuckling though.

288
00:17:56,637 --> 00:18:00,147
Brown and red sort of look similar

289
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:02,327
so you would've been able to switch the cups...

290
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,237
They don't look at all similar!

291
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:06,947
Mine was brown tea that you usually see around a lot,

292
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:09,717
while Reina's was a really vivid red color!

293
00:18:09,837 --> 00:18:11,867
It could never be mistaken, don't you think?

294
00:18:12,347 --> 00:18:17,287
-Did you each decide what tea to drink? -Yes.

295
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:19,877
The tea was lined out on the table, we selected the one we wanted.

296
00:18:20,277 --> 00:18:22,947
After finished drinking, we'd wipe our cups with tissue paper

297
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:24,957
and went on to the next one.

298
00:18:25,077 --> 00:18:29,887
Juri had been drinking the blue tea from way before we arrived though.

299
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:31,257
She said it was good for the body but because it tastes bitter,

300
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:33,387
she wouldn't recommend it.

301
00:18:33,707 --> 00:18:37,637
-By the way, how were you all seated? -Let's see.

302
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:43,597
We sat clockwise, me, Reina, Kazuki and Juri, I think.

303
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:46,157
Because Kazuki and I were looking in at the pictures

304
00:18:46,277 --> 00:18:50,407
in Reina's cell phone from both sides.

305
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:54,125
Who suggested looking at the pictures?

306
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:58,477
Kazuki! It seems that Juri had shown her the pictures before.

307
00:18:58,597 --> 00:18:59,657
She also told us,

308
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:02,687
"Let's have her show us the pictures when we go to visit her."

309
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:06,297
But, Reina refused to let go of the cell phone.

310
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:09,297
That's why both Kazuki and I ended up peeking in from the side.

311
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,857
She's always been that way.

312
00:19:13,977 --> 00:19:17,827
She was strongly dominant, selfish, and nonchalant.

313
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:20,797
Her hubby used to be my boyfriend!

314
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:23,607
She snatched him away from me you see!

315
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:29,457
But, that doesn't mean that I wanted to kill her or anything.

316
00:19:30,487 --> 00:19:31,667
I see...

317
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:33,257
Well, if someone were to have a grudge against her,

318
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:35,747
it would be Kazuki, more than me, I think?

319
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,757
Because she was furious saying

320
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:40,077
that thanks to Reina, she incurred a great loss.

321
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:41,247
A great loss?

322
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:46,007
Of course I'd be furious!

323
00:19:46,177 --> 00:19:49,257
The stocks that Reina recommended me to get took a plunge

324
00:19:49,377 --> 00:19:51,137
and I ended up with a great loss,

325
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,757
but Reina on the other hand, sold it before it went down

326
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,607
and really made out!

327
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,777
-Our sympathies. -Our sympathies.

328
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,557
Thanks to that I'm soaked in debt now.

329
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:04,887
If she knew it was going to go down, she should've told me.

330
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:06,777
Is that why you killed her?

331
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:11,527
If her death would bring my money back, maybe I would have.

332
00:20:14,987 --> 00:20:18,597
I don't want to talk bad about somebody who passed away

333
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,417
but I'm sure that Juri has a load of pent up anger inside her too.

334
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:27,717
Because thanks to Reina her son failed the entrance exam.

335
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:30,217
Failed?

336
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:34,017
Juri and Reina's son were in the same grade,

337
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:36,627
and were studying towards going to the same Junior High School.

338
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:40,107
But a day before the exam, Reina's son who came over to study

339
00:20:40,227 --> 00:20:41,877
had influenza.

340
00:20:41,997 --> 00:20:44,167
Juri's son caught it

341
00:20:44,287 --> 00:20:46,737
and was in no condition to take the exam!

342
00:20:46,857 --> 00:20:50,477
-Our sympathies once again. -Our sympathies once again.

343
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:52,457
Juri was all smiles before he took the exam saying that

344
00:20:52,475 --> 00:20:55,987
she was sure going to have good news to report about soon.

345
00:20:58,997 --> 00:21:01,367
In other words, it would mean that all three of you

346
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:05,467
had some kind of motive to want to kill the victim.

347
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:07,627
-Yes. -Like I already said...

348
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:10,977
We didn't do it!

349
00:21:11,307 --> 00:21:14,307
We may have had grudges against her

350
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:17,767
but Reina was always the way she was,

351
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:20,267
so we all took her for what she was.

352
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:22,767
Hey.

353
00:21:22,987 --> 00:21:28,027
Did anyone leave the room while you all started drinking tea?

354
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:29,407
Yes.

355
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:33,277
Tokie and I, once each.

356
00:21:33,507 --> 00:21:35,077
I went to the restroom

357
00:21:35,197 --> 00:21:37,927
and Tokie went to buy candy to go with the tea.

358
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:41,527
I think that Juri and Reina were both in the room right through.

359
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:44,907
It seems that Reina went to get hot water to put in the thermos.

360
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:48,797
That was before Tokie and I got here though...

361
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:54,647
-It hurts! -Since when were you here?

362
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:57,177
Is that teacup the hospital's?

363
00:21:57,387 --> 00:22:00,317
That's Juri's cup.

364
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:04,187
She said she uses baking soda to polish it spic and span.

365
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:09,457
Which means the only person who could've laced poison

366
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:12,197
and make the victim drink it...

367
00:22:13,797 --> 00:22:19,517
The question is how that person made the victim pick that cup up.

368
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,257
"Next Episode."

369
00:23:43,377 --> 00:23:45,207
The rim of the teacup?

370
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:48,117
Poison was laced there?

371
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:50,707
But, the perpetrator sure has guts. Don't you think so?

372
00:23:52,237 --> 00:23:55,047
How about it? Do you follow?

373
00:23:55,757 --> 00:23:57,655
The person who wait scrupulously for a chance

374
00:23:57,675 --> 00:24:03,655
to switch her cup with that of the victims.

375
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:07,175
The only one who could've done this is you.

376
00:24:07,193 --> 00:24:11,833
Next Conan, "An Awkward Tea Party (Part 2)"

377
00:24:28,027 --> 00:24:30,207
Next Conan's Hint:

378
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:32,037
"Lemon."

379
00:24:32,685 --> 00:24:34,767
-Lemon reminds me of Shinichi. -Is that so?

380
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:37,517
-He must be a sour guy. -I'm not.
