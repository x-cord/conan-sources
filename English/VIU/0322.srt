1
00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:05,371
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:07,571
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:08,971
The truck and ransom that disappeared.

4
00:00:08,972 --> 00:00:11,171
The mysterious veil is peeled off by deduction.

5
00:00:11,172 --> 00:00:12,671
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:14,671
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,672 --> 00:00:16,972
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:58,311
We, the Youth Detective Squad

9
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:03,111
went to visit our classmate Jun Kataoka in the hospital.

10
00:02:03,112 --> 00:02:09,211
But, I was mistaken as being Jun and kidnapped!

11
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,111
The police pursues the Honeybee courier truck

12
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:14,812
that appears to get the ransom!

13
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:18,511
However, that car suddenly disappeared

14
00:02:18,512 --> 00:02:22,012
inside the tunnel of the expressway!

15
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:31,711
"The Kidnap Car That Disappeared (Part 2)"

16
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:33,411
"Supermarket Moriwaki"

17
00:02:33,412 --> 00:02:35,511
Well, I couldn't help it

18
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:38,411
because the battery went dead and I didn't know.

19
00:02:38,412 --> 00:02:40,411
Everybody's probably worried.

20
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:43,511
Too bad. We almost made it.

21
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:46,811
Strange. Conan's not answering.

22
00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:48,611
I wonder if something's happened.

23
00:02:48,612 --> 00:02:51,412
What? What do you mean something?

24
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:16,512
Having a child's body is not bad at a time like this.

25
00:03:21,712 --> 00:03:23,211
Inspector!

26
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:27,112
We did exactly as the kidnapper told us to, didn't we?

27
00:03:29,012 --> 00:03:31,111
"Shigeru Kataoka (40), young entrepreneur" -Jun...

28
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:33,312
Jun's going to be returned to us, isn't he?

29
00:03:34,612 --> 00:03:36,812
We're doing the best we can.

30
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:48,511
"Sachiko Ezaki (30), fashion designer" -Sachiko?

31
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:50,311
What about the rehearsal?

32
00:03:50,312 --> 00:03:52,411
What's up with your rehearsal?

33
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:55,511
I explained to the staff that I will be canceling the show.

34
00:03:55,512 --> 00:03:59,011
No way! Your future depends on it!

35
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:01,211
Never mind us and go back there!

36
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:03,811
I'm so worried that I can't just do nothing!

37
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:07,312
I couldn't possibly do my thing even if I went back there.

38
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:11,811
And... how's Jun?

39
00:04:11,812 --> 00:04:13,911
Nothing... yet.

40
00:04:13,912 --> 00:04:15,711
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:18,211
We the police are doing all we can

42
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:19,911
to locate the Honeybee courier truck,

43
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:22,811
the whereabouts of the truck that fled.

44
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:24,411
Inspector Megure!

45
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:26,411
Did you get any new report?

46
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:29,111
We contacted the Honeybee courier company

47
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:32,011
and found that all the vehicles are doing their usual rounds,

48
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:34,011
and all of them are accounted for.

49
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:37,511
Could the Honeybee courier truck have been stolen?

50
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:39,212
No.

51
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:44,511
Are you saying that you have no clue as to the kidnapper?

52
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:46,512
Well, Inspector?

53
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:51,812
Oh, excuse me for a moment.

54
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:54,911
This is Megure.

55
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:56,812
Oh! Officer Takagi!

56
00:04:57,612 --> 00:04:59,311
What?

57
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:02,212
Jun came back to the hospital!

58
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,712
Jun!

59
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:19,511
I'm so glad! Jun, you're okay.

60
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:21,312
We were really worried about you.

61
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:26,511
How's your leg?

62
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:28,711
"Jun Kataoka (7), Kataoka's son" -Nothing's wrong with my leg!

63
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:30,911
"Jun Kataoka (7), Kataoka's son" -Oh, that's good.

64
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:34,211
Officer Takagi! Just what is the meaning of this?

65
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:36,511
Well, the thing is

66
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:40,011
they came back to the hospital on their own.

67
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:41,511
What?

68
00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:45,211
Were you with Jun all this time?

69
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,211
Yeah, but...

70
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:50,011
-Isn't it? -Yes...

71
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:53,211
Where were you all this time?

72
00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:55,211
Where...

73
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:57,412
Jun, you tell them...

74
00:05:59,012 --> 00:06:01,511
I asked them the same question too

75
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:03,411
but they won't tell me.

76
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:07,711
It seems that Jun wasn't kidnapped.

77
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:09,712
Kidnapped?

78
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:14,011
Since he disappeared from the hospital,

79
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:16,011
we were all worried that he was kidnapped.

80
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:17,811
What?

81
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:22,211
Well, the bed was empty.

82
00:06:22,212 --> 00:06:26,211
And soon after that we got a call demanding ransom.

83
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:28,011
The bed was empty?

84
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,311
Don't tell me that...

85
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:31,711
-Yeah. -Huh?

86
00:06:31,712 --> 00:06:33,911
What's the matter?

87
00:06:33,912 --> 00:06:35,211
Big trouble!

88
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:37,711
Conan is the one who was kidnapped!

89
00:06:37,712 --> 00:06:39,611
What?

90
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:41,911
Since Jun said he wanted to go play games,

91
00:06:41,912 --> 00:06:44,711
Conan stayed back at the hospital in his place!

92
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:46,911
I called him on the Youth Detective badge several times

93
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:48,511
but he hasn't answered!

94
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:50,011
Maybe...

95
00:06:50,012 --> 00:06:52,112
Maybe... what?

96
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:57,512
Conan!

97
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:05,211
Okay, all done.

98
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:07,411
Thank you!

99
00:07:07,412 --> 00:07:09,312
You're welcome.

100
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:13,011
Okay.

101
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:15,711
Will you explain, Conan?

102
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:21,611
Yep. The kidnapper mistook me for Jun and kidnapped me.

103
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:23,411
Just as I thought.

104
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:26,611
And? Where were you after you were kidnapped?

105
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,111
There's this closed down factory in Okuho-cho,

106
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:30,811
and was in the basement.

107
00:07:30,812 --> 00:07:32,911
Did you see the kidnapper's face?

108
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,011
Yep.

109
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:36,511
He had a mole on the side of his nose.

110
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:38,711
Officer Takagi. Call Tomokawa right away

111
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:40,511
and have him draw a composite sketch on the double!

112
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:42,311
Yes, sir!

113
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:44,511
I'm so glad everyone's okay.

114
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:45,911
Although the money was taken,

115
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:48,411
it's no big deal if the children are all right.

116
00:07:48,412 --> 00:07:50,711
Jun, apologize to everyone.

117
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:51,712
Why?

118
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:53,511
What do you mean?

119
00:07:53,512 --> 00:07:55,911
Because everyone worried about you.

120
00:07:55,912 --> 00:07:58,411
You all worried of your own initiative!

121
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:00,212
What should I care?

122
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:02,112
Jun!

123
00:08:02,113 --> 00:08:04,511
Jun. Wait!

124
00:08:04,512 --> 00:08:07,011
What do you think you're doing? Let me go!

125
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:08,211
Ouch!

126
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:10,212
Darn! Let me go!

127
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:15,011
That's enough!

128
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:18,112
What a thing to say after you've done something selfish like this?

129
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:24,712
Ouch...

130
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:28,611
I'm sorry, Jun.

131
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:30,511
It hurt, didn't it? I'm sorry.

132
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:34,811
But, Conan got hurt because of you.

133
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:39,412
Still, that doesn't mean that it's okay for me to hit you, does it?

134
00:08:44,012 --> 00:08:46,812
Inspector, I'm sorry.

135
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:55,011
I'm hungry.

136
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:57,511
-Conan. -I guess we'll get going then.

137
00:08:57,512 --> 00:08:59,712
-See you. -Yeah.

138
00:09:03,512 --> 00:09:07,312
I've got to stay back and help with the composite sketch.

139
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:12,111
Why?

140
00:09:12,112 --> 00:09:14,111
The Honeybee courier truck that went into the tunnel.

141
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:16,712
Why didn't it come out of the exit?

142
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:36,611
It's the same compact truck after all!

143
00:09:36,612 --> 00:09:39,411
I see, I get it.

144
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,012
Officer Takagi!

145
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:43,211
What's the matter?

146
00:09:43,212 --> 00:09:46,611
I've figure out the mystery of the Honeybee courier truck

147
00:09:46,612 --> 00:09:48,111
disappearing in the tunnel.

148
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:51,211
Huh? Really? Tell me about it, Officer Takagi!

149
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:53,311
Why did the kidnapper use such a flashy car

150
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:55,411
such as the Honeybee courier truck?

151
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:58,311
He probably did so to get our attention.

152
00:09:58,312 --> 00:09:59,611
Yep, and then?

153
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:02,111
So, we the police were only concentrating on

154
00:10:02,112 --> 00:10:04,511
looking out for this flashy Honeybee Courier.

155
00:10:04,512 --> 00:10:07,911
However, the kidnapper paints the truck inside the tunnel

156
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:10,512
and changed the design of the truck.

157
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:14,011
That's this compact truck!

158
00:10:14,012 --> 00:10:17,711
It didn't disappear, but rather, deceived us.

159
00:10:17,712 --> 00:10:22,811
How long did that compact truck stay inside the tunnel?

160
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:24,911
About 10 minutes.

161
00:10:24,912 --> 00:10:26,311
Then, wouldn't it be impossible?

162
00:10:26,312 --> 00:10:29,711
It's not possible to paint an entire car in just 10 minutes.

163
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,411
Oh.

164
00:10:31,412 --> 00:10:33,711
I thought it was a pretty good deduction, though.

165
00:10:33,712 --> 00:10:35,311
Officer Takagi!

166
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:37,111
The body of a man who was strangled to death

167
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:39,911
was found by the riverbed of Teimusu River.

168
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:41,611
What?

169
00:10:41,612 --> 00:10:43,911
The victim is around his 40's

170
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:46,512
and has a mole on the side of his nose.

171
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:50,811
According to Conan, the kidnapper also had...

172
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,711
Yep, a mole on the side of his nose!

173
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:54,711
Then, it could be the same person!

174
00:10:54,712 --> 00:10:57,011
It's possible. Let's go!

175
00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:58,411
Yes, sir!

176
00:10:58,412 --> 00:11:00,011
Inspector Megure.

177
00:11:00,012 --> 00:11:02,511
Wouldn't it be better if I go along too?

178
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:04,211
Because I saw the kidnapper's face.

179
00:11:04,212 --> 00:11:07,412
Oh, but...

180
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:10,111
There's nothing to worry about my wound,

181
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:11,812
I'm just fine.

182
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:19,911
From the driver's license that the victim had on him,

183
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,411
he is Tadashi Yoshizawa, age 42.

184
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:24,911
He has strangulation marks on his neck,

185
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:26,811
so he probably died of suffocation.

186
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,311
I see.

187
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:32,111
And, this is what we found on the floor of the passenger's seat.

188
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:35,312
Huh? Earrings.

189
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:40,211
This car has been reported stolen 2 days ago.

190
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:41,411
I see.

191
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:43,611
Inspector Megure.

192
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:47,211
The person who kidnapped me is this man.

193
00:11:47,212 --> 00:11:49,111
Just as I thought.

194
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:51,311
And, when is the estimated time of death?

195
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:54,211
We think it is between 13:00 to 14:00.

196
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:55,411
So, he was strangled to death

197
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:59,011
right after he made away with the cash.

198
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:00,611
And? What about the cash and all?

199
00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:03,011
There was nothing of that sort anywhere.

200
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:05,511
Judging from the fact that the cash is gone,

201
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:07,511
it's most likely that he had an accomplice.

202
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:10,411
They probably got into a brawl which ended up in him being killed.

203
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:14,411
We need to do a thorough check this guy Yoshizawa's associates!

204
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:16,111
Inspector!

205
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:17,911
Oh, Officer Sato!

206
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:20,011
Inspector, I'm sorry I'm late!

207
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:21,811
Did you find out anything more?

208
00:12:21,812 --> 00:12:23,011
Yes.

209
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:26,011
While checking the people who are in close proximity to Mr. Kataoka,

210
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,911
I came across something that may be of concern.

211
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:29,811
Something of concern?

212
00:12:29,812 --> 00:12:30,911
Right.

213
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:32,112
Well...

214
00:12:36,312 --> 00:12:38,811
Although it doesn't have the honeybee mark on it,

215
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:42,011
this is the truck that was used to kidnap me.

216
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,611
Officer Takagi's deduction

217
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:47,011
was partially correct after all!

218
00:12:47,012 --> 00:12:51,812
But, how in a matter of 10 minutes inside the tunnel...

219
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:03,943
Yes, this is my earring.

220
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:07,243
I dropped it somewhere and I was looking for it.

221
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,943
Where did you find this?

222
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:12,043
Before I answer your question, I'd like to ask you something.

223
00:13:12,044 --> 00:13:15,243
Do you know a person by the name of Yoshizawa?

224
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:16,543
Yoshizawa?

225
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:17,843
He's man with a mole on the side of his nose,

226
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:20,343
who is around 40 years old.

227
00:13:20,344 --> 00:13:22,743
No, I don't.

228
00:13:22,744 --> 00:13:24,743
What about him?

229
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:27,043
He found dead in a compact truck

230
00:13:27,044 --> 00:13:30,943
that was found abandoned by the riverbed of the Teimusu River.

231
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,343
Oh, my!

232
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,843
That earring was found near the corpse.

233
00:13:35,844 --> 00:13:37,143
Huh?

234
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:39,043
According to Conan,

235
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:40,843
it seems that there's no mistake that

236
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:43,343
Yoshizawa is responsible for the kidnapping.

237
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,943
Judging from the fact that

238
00:13:44,944 --> 00:13:47,843
the ransom was not found anywhere near him,

239
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:50,643
it is most likely that he had an accomplice,

240
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:54,743
who he had a fight with, and as result was killed.

241
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:56,043
I see.

242
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,343
And, who is this accomplice?

243
00:13:58,344 --> 00:14:00,843
After checking Yoshizawa's residence,

244
00:14:00,844 --> 00:14:03,343
they seem to have found the date of

245
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:05,643
Jun's discharge from the hospital tomorrow

246
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,043
marked on the calendar.

247
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:10,743
In other words, Yoshizawa and the accomplice carried out the crime

248
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:12,843
knowing that he would still be in the hospital.

249
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:16,243
And Yoshizawa did not call Mr. Kataoka's residence but rather,

250
00:14:16,244 --> 00:14:19,443
called him directly on his cell phone.

251
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:20,444
And finally,

252
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:23,443
the tracking device that we put inside the bag with the ransom.

253
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:27,143
The people who knew about this besides us were very limited.

254
00:14:27,144 --> 00:14:30,043
What are you trying to get at?

255
00:14:30,044 --> 00:14:31,743
So, Yoshizawa's accomplice

256
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:35,044
has to be somebody who is very close to you!

257
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:40,643
By the way, Ms. Ezaki,

258
00:14:40,644 --> 00:14:42,943
we hear that you have debts?

259
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:45,343
Huh?

260
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:48,043
For the last two shows you had, you needed 20,000,000 yen,

261
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:50,443
and for preparation fees for this show, you needed 10,000,000 yen.

262
00:14:50,444 --> 00:14:52,343
That makes a total of 30,000,000 yen,

263
00:14:52,344 --> 00:14:55,243
the same amount as the ransom demanded this time.

264
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:56,843
That's...

265
00:14:56,844 --> 00:15:00,943
How do you intend to pay back your debts?

266
00:15:00,944 --> 00:15:04,443
So if this show that is to be held succeeds...

267
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:06,143
If it doesn't succeed,

268
00:15:06,144 --> 00:15:08,844
all you'll be left with are the debts.

269
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,343
Please wait!

270
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:17,243
Are you saying that she kidnapped Jun because of her debts?

271
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:19,043
I can't really say yet.

272
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:23,543
But it's true that the circumstances look pretty bad for Ms. Ezaki.

273
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:25,443
I haven't done anything!

274
00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:27,843
I don't know a person by the name of Yoshizawa either.

275
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,943
Anyway, we'll get the details from you at the station.

276
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:33,543
Will you please come with us?

277
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:35,543
All right.

278
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:36,743
Just as I thought.

279
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:40,143
She was after the money after all.

280
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:41,244
Jun.

281
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:45,043
Huh? Ms. Ezaki?

282
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,743
Yeah, she came.

283
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:48,843
About what time? Do you remember?

284
00:15:48,844 --> 00:15:51,543
I think it was before 13:00.

285
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:56,243
She came to say that the show today may be cancelled.

286
00:15:56,244 --> 00:15:57,743
13.00.

287
00:15:57,744 --> 00:16:02,143
Yoshizawa's estimated time of death is between 13:00 and 14:00.

288
00:16:02,144 --> 00:16:05,043
So alibi barely makes it...

289
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:07,143
I really don't want her to cancel it

290
00:16:07,144 --> 00:16:10,643
because her designs are fantastic this time.

291
00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:13,444
I'm sure it'll be a success!

292
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,643
Separating trash and throwing them away appropriately

293
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:22,043
is manners, right?

294
00:16:22,044 --> 00:16:23,844
Maybe...

295
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:26,943
You're right.

296
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,843
It's special so there aren't many companies that make it.

297
00:16:30,844 --> 00:16:32,643
Do you know the name of the company?

298
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:35,543
Yeah, of course.

299
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:36,943
That's right.

300
00:16:36,944 --> 00:16:38,943
Until I get my part from you guys,

301
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:41,743
I can't die even if I wanted to.

302
00:16:41,744 --> 00:16:45,943
Bring the cash and come to the place where the kid was confined!

303
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:48,143
I'll be waiting.

304
00:16:48,144 --> 00:16:51,143
Wait, Officer Sato, I don't think that's a good idea!

305
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,843
We can't afford to be going out at a busy time like this

306
00:16:53,844 --> 00:16:55,743
just because Conan is telling us to come.

307
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:59,143
Don't worry, I'll take full responsibility!

308
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,544
Even so...

309
00:17:02,544 --> 00:17:05,643
Besides, no matter how I think it out,

310
00:17:05,644 --> 00:17:08,243
I can't believe that Ms. Ezaki is a culprit.

311
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:11,343
I feel the same too.

312
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:14,743
Well, Conan sure notices a lot of things other people don't,

313
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:17,243
so he could help us find a lead to something, right?

314
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,644
Oh.

315
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:23,643
You said you remembered something, what is it, Conan?

316
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:28,043
This is the factory where you were confined, right, Conan?

317
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:29,143
There he is!

318
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:30,443
Huh? What?

319
00:17:30,444 --> 00:17:32,344
Hide!

320
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,244
Huh? That car.

321
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:46,143
Mr. Kitayama.

322
00:17:46,144 --> 00:17:48,743
"Goro Kitayama (48), Kataoka's driver" -Yoshizawa?

323
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:51,044
Hey, Yoshizawa?

324
00:17:53,544 --> 00:17:56,443
Hey, Yoshizawa, it's me!

325
00:17:56,444 --> 00:17:58,543
Mr. Kitayama.

326
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,243
What an unusual place to run into you.

327
00:18:01,244 --> 00:18:03,443
What brings you here?

328
00:18:03,444 --> 00:18:05,243
What?

329
00:18:05,244 --> 00:18:07,543
Nothing really...

330
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:11,443
You seem to know Tadashi Yoshizawa.

331
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:15,044
You came because Mr. Yoshizawa told you to come, right?

332
00:18:16,244 --> 00:18:18,743
You were told to bring his share of the money

333
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:21,943
to the place the kid was confined, right?

334
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:23,243
But, Conan...

335
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:27,343
This place is known only to me and the kidnapper.

336
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:29,843
But he knows this place too, which means...

337
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:33,743
aren't you an accomplice of the kidnapper, mister?

338
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:36,143
What a thing to say?

339
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:37,443
I see.

340
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:40,743
You would know Mr. Kataoka's cell phone number

341
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,043
and about the tracking device too.

342
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:45,643
Hey, wait a minute!

343
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:49,943
You used to work for a printing company before, didn't you?

344
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:52,443
Conan, what are you trying to get at?

345
00:18:52,444 --> 00:18:55,943
The advertisements that we see on the body of vehicles these days,

346
00:18:55,944 --> 00:19:00,143
those are all printed adhesive seals, right?

347
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:02,243
Are you talking about the wrapping bus?

348
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:04,643
Wrapping bus?

349
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,943
I see! I got it!

350
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:09,143
Huh? What?

351
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:11,043
I've figured out the mystery of

352
00:19:11,044 --> 00:19:14,643
how the compact Honeybee courier truck disappeared in the tunnel!

353
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:20,043
Yoshizawa wrapped the truck that he stole,

354
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:22,643
then he went to get the ransom.

355
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:25,943
While he fled on the truck, he peeled off the wrapping in the tunnel,

356
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:30,243
pretended to be a different truck and got away.

357
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:35,744
Mr. Kitayama, aren't you the one who printed that seal?

358
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:38,643
Well?

359
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,143
This is ridiculous!

360
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:43,243
Everything you're saying is based on assumption!

361
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:44,943
Huh?

362
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:46,443
What's this...

363
00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:47,944
Bag...

364
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:52,143
Look, Officer Takagi.

365
00:19:52,144 --> 00:19:54,943
There's so much money inside!

366
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,643
Mr. Kitayama, we'd like to talk to you,

367
00:19:57,644 --> 00:19:59,843
so could you come with us to the station?

368
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:00,844
Darn!

369
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:04,143
Officer Sato!

370
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:05,444
No way!

371
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:08,443
Officer Takagi!

372
00:20:08,444 --> 00:20:09,843
Move!

373
00:20:09,844 --> 00:20:11,044
Hold it!

374
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:15,944
You're not getting away!

375
00:20:22,744 --> 00:20:25,343
Goro Kitayama, you're under arrest

376
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:28,543
for obstructing official duty and inflicting injury!

377
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:30,243
Ouch...

378
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:32,243
You killed Tadashi Yoshizawa

379
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:34,743
and put Ms. Ezaki's earring near his corpse

380
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:38,243
to confuse investigation, didn't you?

381
00:20:38,244 --> 00:20:40,643
Isn't Yoshizawa alive?

382
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:42,043
What are you talking about?

383
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:45,143
He was found dead!

384
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,543
Who called me on the phone then?

385
00:20:47,544 --> 00:20:50,044
What the heck are you talking about?

386
00:22:31,744 --> 00:22:34,043
Wow. How fantastic.

387
00:22:34,044 --> 00:22:38,143
Ayumi, is this all there is to a fashion show?

388
00:22:38,144 --> 00:22:40,943
They serving us food and stuff part way, aren't they?

389
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:44,843
Gee, I tell you, Genta, of course not!

390
00:22:44,844 --> 00:22:48,543
Didn't I tell you that it'd be boring for kids?

391
00:22:48,544 --> 00:22:49,943
Let me introduce you!

392
00:22:49,944 --> 00:22:52,043
The designer of this collection,

393
00:22:52,044 --> 00:22:53,644
Sachiko Ezaki!

394
00:23:12,344 --> 00:23:13,944
Jun.

395
00:23:18,144 --> 00:23:20,143
Thank you, Jun.

396
00:23:20,144 --> 00:23:23,843
The tuxedo looks really nice on you.

397
00:23:23,844 --> 00:23:27,544
Dad told me to give you this bouquet.

398
00:23:28,944 --> 00:23:30,844
I see...

399
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,543
Congratulations...

400
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:35,844
Mom.

401
00:24:00,044 --> 00:24:02,143
But, it seems Heiji was waiting in front of this door

402
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:04,643
for a long time.

403
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:07,143
Look on the side of the paper.

404
00:24:07,144 --> 00:24:11,144
Isn't that the mark of the cap that Heiji's always wearing?

405
00:24:12,044 --> 00:24:13,543
But this tape...

406
00:24:13,544 --> 00:24:17,143
A long time has passed since it peeled off.

407
00:24:17,144 --> 00:24:20,543
In other words, Mr. Kusukawa intended to come back right away,

408
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:23,344
but something came up and he couldn't.

409
00:24:23,944 --> 00:24:25,243
Next Conan,

410
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:29,644
"Heiji Hattori No Way Out (Part 1)"
