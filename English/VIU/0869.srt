1
00:00:51,464 --> 00:00:53,464
Where do you think you're going?

2
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:58,264
I wasn't told you'd be killing anyone.

3
00:00:58,264 --> 00:01:00,664
They ignored my warning

4
00:01:00,664 --> 00:01:03,364
that I'd kill them if they resisted.

5
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:05,464
They got what they deserved.

6
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:09,164
I... I want out.

7
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:11,664
I wasn't told you'd be coping out.

8
00:01:11,664 --> 00:01:13,864
It's a breach of contract.

9
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:15,764
A betrayal.

10
00:01:15,764 --> 00:01:18,164
You've got to pay for this.

11
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:21,264
Hey, you guys!

12
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:24,464
What are you doing there?

13
00:01:26,964 --> 00:01:28,064
Hey!

14
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:41,664
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

15
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:44,164
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

16
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:46,164
The secret maneuvers of the criminals behind the scene.

17
00:01:46,164 --> 00:01:48,364
Is the Detective Squad going come in contact with them?

18
00:01:48,364 --> 00:01:50,064
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:52,164
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:52,164 --> 00:01:54,564
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,470
"Conan Disappears Over a Cliff (Part 1)"

22
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,670
People have fallen victim

23
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,370
to serial arsonist and robber aka Zorro,

24
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,270
who killed three residents of the house he broke into.

25
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,870
He also seriously injured a police officer

26
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,370
who attended the scene after report of the fire,

27
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,970
and is now on the run.

28
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,870
According to the other police officer who was also at the scene...

29
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,970
-Jerk. -the perpetrator...

30
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,670
fired his crossbow without warning.

31
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,270
He targets only the residents of celebrities.

32
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,970
They will do all they can to pursue the perpetrator.

33
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,470
He's not what his name, Zorro implies.

34
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,270
He's a vicious, heinous and brutal criminal.

35
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,170
I know it's your day off,

36
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,370
but it's still day time, so don't drink too much, Dad.

37
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,370
I know!

38
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,970
Where did he go?

39
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,770
The shrimpy smart aleck

40
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,170
that always says his piece when seeing news like these?

41
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,870
Conan went out with Ai and the other kids.

42
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,270
Did you forget?

43
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,170
I envy kids because they're so carefree.

44
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,170
Dad, I envy you

45
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,870
because you're so carefree, too.

46
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,270
Well, I'm not wrong about that.

47
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,970
Here goes...

48
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,570
-Eels over rice! -Pudding!

49
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,970
So, did you figure it out, Conan?

50
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,970
Anmitsu, pudding and eels over rice.

51
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,370
Correct!

52
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,570
Amazing!

53
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,770
How did you figure it out?

54
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,070
Who wouldn't?

55
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,870
So next, it's the subjects we like!

56
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,570
I'll figure that out right away too, though.

57
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,570
Okay, we're almost there.

58
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,070
How fantastic!

59
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,370
To think that we can sleep over at a place like this.

60
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,870
We're celebrities!

61
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,970
I'm sure they have top-notch eels over rice, too!

62
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,870
I wonder about that.

63
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,570
I hate to disappoint you,

64
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,770
but we have to cook for ourselves here, Genta.

65
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,570
No... No way.

66
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,670
But Doc sure has some impressive personal connections.

67
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,870
You even know someone who owns a villa like this.

68
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,770
I wonder if Doc has any friends

69
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,570
who own an eels restaurant?

70
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,070
No.

71
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,570
You don't have to be so blunt.

72
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,970
What's wrong, Ayumi?

73
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,070
Hey. Who is he?

74
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,170
He's alive.

75
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,170
He's seriously hurt, but still breathing.

76
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,070
Ai, call an ambulance.

77
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,370
Understood.

78
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,270
What a shock as soon as we get here.

79
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,970
I wonder who and where he came from

80
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,670
and what happened to him?

81
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,670
I wonder if we've got a case?

82
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,270
Maybe he's just a burglar.

83
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,670
He snuck in, goofed and hurt himself.

84
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,070
Well, it's possible

85
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,070
if he could shoot his own arm with a crossbow.

86
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,670
Crossbow?

87
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,270
If I remember correctly, yesterday's...

88
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,070
Where's Conan?

89
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,070
He was here just a minute ago.

90
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,070
Did the man drop this?

91
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,270
What's this?

92
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,570
I think they're either IDs or passwords.

93
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,770
Ai.

94
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,470
They're both different.

95
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,070
What are you going to do with it?

96
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,270
Are you turning it in?

97
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,670
Well, I guess.

98
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,070
Tell the others what you have to.

99
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,170
What I have to?

100
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,170
"Misakihama Clinic"

101
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,670
A crossbow was used in yesterday's robbery case.

102
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,570
I wanted to ask him about it,

103
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,470
but I guess I still can't.

104
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,170
Military boots?

105
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,070
What?

106
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,470
All I have to do now is to call the police.

107
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,170
Inspector Megure.

108
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,670
Does this mean it has something to do with yesterday's case?

109
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,870
Darn!

110
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,570
Conan?

111
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,570
A suspicious person fled out through the window!

112
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,770
Check the back door!

113
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,170
What?

114
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,370
This is no good.

115
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,370
He got away.

116
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,970
I found this in the trash dump by the back door.

117
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,770
So the wounded person

118
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,470
is a member of Zorro's group?

119
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,970
Rather, it seems that he's hiring people to work with him

120
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,870
each time he comes up with a new job.

121
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,670
"Yuji Isehara (28), Hacker" -Yuji Isehara, 28 years old.

122
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,970
He's a proficient hacker

123
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,970
who even our cyber crime division was looking for.

124
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,270
It seems he hacks the target's security information

125
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,470
and manipulates it.

126
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,570
We got an identification report from Kanagawa Police Department

127
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,170
saying that they have a man who fits the description in custody.

128
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,670
So we came here.

129
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,270
Is this enough information?

130
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,970
Thank you very much.

131
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,970
I can report this to Pops Kogoro now.

132
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,770
What? Isehara is missing too?

133
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,270
What?

134
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,570
Dispatch a search immediately!

135
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,670
Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

136
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,370
I see.

137
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,870
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Thank you

138
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,570
for reporting it to me, Inspector.

139
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,470
One of the robber's in yesterday's case

140
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,570
showed up at the villa where Conan and the others are?

141
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,970
Yeah.

142
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,970
Apparently, they found him wounded

143
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,170
and hiding in the yard.

144
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,370
I wonder if Conan's okay.

145
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,170
The inspector and the others are there,

146
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,870
so there is nothing to worry about.

147
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,870
It's not that.

148
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,870
"Misakihama Clinic"

149
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,370
I'm glad I took a picture, just in case.

150
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,370
Let's see.

151
00:12:24,564 --> 00:12:26,964
"Mouri Detective Agency"

152
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,564
How long are you going to keep on drinking, Dad?

153
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:33,764
-Let's go. -What?

154
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:34,964
It's apparent that Conan's

155
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:38,364
not going to just sit there and do nothing.

156
00:12:38,364 --> 00:12:41,664
I'm sure he's going to get involved in something dangerous.

157
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:45,464
But I wasn't even asked to take care of the crime or anything.

158
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,564
-What are you talking about? -There's no reason for me,

159
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:49,664
-the renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri... -Come on.

160
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:51,564
-Let's go. -to go out there and...

161
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:52,564
Ouch...

162
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,764
We're leaving.

163
00:12:53,764 --> 00:12:55,764
It hurts...

164
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:06,164
Okay, I'm close.

165
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:16,964
Conan's not being fair.

166
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,264
He's got to tell us if something comes up.

167
00:13:20,264 --> 00:13:24,264
The Youth Detective Squad is not a one man team.

168
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:27,364
I'm hungry.

169
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:55,364
Where did Conan go?

170
00:13:55,364 --> 00:13:57,464
That's strange.

171
00:13:57,464 --> 00:13:59,964
He was in view till just a while ago.

172
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,664
It's getting kind of dark.

173
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:06,064
I wonder if Conan is going to be okay?

174
00:14:06,064 --> 00:14:07,864
That goes for us as well.

175
00:14:07,864 --> 00:14:10,364
Don't... Don't tell me...

176
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:14,164
It sort of looks as if we're lost.

177
00:14:14,164 --> 00:14:16,264
What? No way.

178
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:18,864
What about dinner?

179
00:14:18,864 --> 00:14:20,964
Dinner.

180
00:14:22,264 --> 00:14:25,164
The sun is setting over that side,

181
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,664
so the sea is on this side.

182
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:30,364
If we go back now, I can tell the direction.

183
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:33,264
So if you want to, we can start going back right away.

184
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:34,764
Really, Ai?

185
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:36,964
You're really something, Ai.

186
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:38,964
So, we won't be missing dinner?

187
00:14:38,964 --> 00:14:43,164
That's right, so why don't we go a little farther?

188
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:47,264
If I keep going this way...

189
00:14:47,264 --> 00:14:49,064
Where is this?

190
00:14:49,064 --> 00:14:52,064
The sunset's over that side,

191
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:54,364
and the sea's on this side, so...

192
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:58,764
This is...

193
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,764
I'm inside a cave.

194
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:07,864
Sea breeze?

195
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:11,364
Does that mean I can pass through?

196
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:17,964
Of course not.

197
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:27,064
This looks impressive.

198
00:15:29,364 --> 00:15:32,364
I don't have time to waste.

199
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,864
I finally made it back,

200
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:44,264
but it's all dark already.

201
00:15:58,064 --> 00:16:00,464
Am I lost again?

202
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:03,464
I guess I'll have to backtrack again.

203
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:04,764
What's that?

204
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:22,664
I found it.

205
00:16:48,564 --> 00:16:50,464
What an idiot.

206
00:16:50,464 --> 00:16:53,264
What are we going to do with him, Zorro?

207
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,464
"Go Mizorogi (35), Armed Robber Zorro" -I see right through you, Isehara.

208
00:16:57,464 --> 00:17:00,464
I know exactly where you're headed for.

209
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:06,664
It's him!

210
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:10,764
Spare... Spare me.

211
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:14,064
Please spare me.

212
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:16,864
For your wife and child?

213
00:17:16,864 --> 00:17:19,164
What a soap opera.

214
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:24,364
You talked, didn't you?

215
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:28,099
I... I didn't say anything!

216
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,999
I'll let you choose, then.

217
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:34,199
Either you let me get rid of your wife and child

218
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:36,899
or die here alone.

219
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:39,099
Whichever you like.

220
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:42,299
Come on.

221
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:24,799
Who's there?

222
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:32,499
Isehara!

223
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:39,899
This way!

224
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:41,299
Who are you?

225
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:43,899
Conan Edogawa. I'm a detective.

226
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:45,399
A detective?

227
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:46,599
Where did he go?

228
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:48,699
Hurry!

229
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,199
A child?

230
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:07,399
Darn it.

231
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:09,199
Where did they go?

232
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:15,899
They... They're going to kill me!

233
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:17,499
You'll be fine.

234
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:20,299
They haven't figured out where we are.

235
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:32,099
No! I don't want to die!

236
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:34,699
This way!

237
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,899
Wait.

238
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,899
This is...

239
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:28,299
Conan!

240
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:30,799
What? Conan?

241
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,099
Conan!

242
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,999
One more drink. No, two more.

243
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:46,199
Why do I have this bad premonition?

244
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:48,399
Excuse me. Please hurry!

245
00:20:51,699 --> 00:20:54,399
Dad, get up already.

246
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,099
Spare... Spare me.

247
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:01,499
Please.

248
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:04,499
You're causing us so much trouble.

249
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:06,499
Traitor.

250
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:18,599
Die!

251
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,099
Conan!

252
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:54,499
Dr. Agasa.

253
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:57,799
Thank you for coming out to see us.

254
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:01,199
Did something happen to Conan and the rest?

255
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,799
Well, the thing is

256
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,599
I just got a call from the kids.

257
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,999
What did you say?

258
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:11,099
Conan's...

259
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:12,999
Don't tell me...

260
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,899
-No! -Ran!

261
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:17,299
Ran!

262
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,999
"Next Episode" -Conan's...

263
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:46,299
It can't be true.

264
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,499
But we saw it, didn't we?

265
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:52,399
I won't let them do something like that ever.

266
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:53,799
Inspector.

267
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,499
What? Ai's missing, too?

268
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,299
I came alone just like you told me to.

269
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:03,699
Let's go.

270
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,199
Next Conan,

271
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:12,799
"Conan Disappears Over a Cliff (Part 2)"
