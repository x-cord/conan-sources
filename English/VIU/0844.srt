1
00:00:00,523 --> 00:00:03,922
We, the members of the Detective Squad come to

2
00:00:03,923 --> 00:00:07,722
the classy restaurant at the top of the Beika Department Store

3
00:00:07,723 --> 00:00:09,623
because Dr. Agasa won a meal ticket.

4
00:00:11,023 --> 00:00:13,822
However, the chef of the restaurant there

5
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:17,023
is seriously injured after being stabbed in the stomach.

6
00:00:18,123 --> 00:00:20,122
I contacted the members of the Detective Squad

7
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:21,822
who scattered inside the department store right away

8
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:24,123
and instructed them to look for the perp.

9
00:00:25,923 --> 00:00:28,822
Now, we need to get the testimonies of the children

10
00:00:28,823 --> 00:00:30,922
who say they saw the perp.

11
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:32,422
They'll do fine!

12
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:33,922
They say they didn't see the perp's face

13
00:00:33,923 --> 00:00:36,322
but they remember the characteristics!

14
00:00:36,323 --> 00:00:38,822
He was pretty small!

15
00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:41,122
He had the number "2" on his clothes.

16
00:00:41,123 --> 00:00:43,622
His clothes were gray!

17
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:47,122
The color was like what Ai is wearing now!

18
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:49,222
-Wrong. -What?

19
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:52,922
He was pretty big and was wearing dark gray clothes!

20
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:55,822
And he ran like a man!

21
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:59,322
I thought it was a woman.

22
00:00:59,323 --> 00:01:02,522
She was wearing light gray clothes that was almost white.

23
00:01:02,523 --> 00:01:06,722
She was of normal height, a little taller than Doc!

24
00:01:06,723 --> 00:01:07,723
Hey, hey.

25
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:09,622
-I said he was small built! -We've got a problem here.

26
00:01:09,623 --> 00:01:11,122
It's no mistake that he was big built!

27
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:13,823
-Their testimonies are all different! -Nope! It was a woman!

28
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:19,922
A canvas stained black with crime.

29
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:22,622
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color!

30
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:24,622
First of all, Merry Christmas!

31
00:01:24,623 --> 00:01:27,022
Can the mystery of the varied testimonies be solved?

32
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:28,622
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:30,622
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,923
His name is Detective Conan!

35
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,360
"The Detective Squad is in a Grove (Part 2)"

36
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:21,951
Hey, Conan!

37
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,852
Wait!

38
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:29,451
What?

39
00:03:29,452 --> 00:03:30,951
What's up, Mitsuhiko?

40
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:32,851
When I saw the perp,

41
00:03:32,852 --> 00:03:36,751
those mannequins were lined out by the 5th floor stairs!

42
00:03:36,752 --> 00:03:39,751
I just remembered that the perp went down the stairs

43
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:43,651
weaving through the mannequins!

44
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:46,951
Sir! Did you really have them lined out on the 5th floor?

45
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:49,451
Yeah, about 10 of them.

46
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:51,151
Since we're having a children's uniform fair

47
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:53,851
at the sport equipment department,

48
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:56,251
I'm taking the mannequins that were stored in the 5th floor storage room

49
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:58,451
up to the 7th floor.

50
00:03:58,452 --> 00:04:00,651
Because the 5th floor used to be the toy department before

51
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:02,651
and they used to handle children's clothes, too.

52
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:03,851
Really?

53
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:07,251
I also carried an extra four to five signs up to the 7th floor

54
00:04:07,252 --> 00:04:09,051
so I'm pooped.

55
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:12,451
The business elevator is under maintenance right now,

56
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,151
but my boss wants to hurry things up, you see.

57
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:16,451
That's right.

58
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:18,651
The signs blocked my view

59
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:21,551
so I couldn't see the perp from neck up!

60
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,851
Then if you see those signs,

61
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:27,151
maybe you'll be able to figure out how tall the perp was?

62
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:30,551
But there were signs of varying heights

63
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:32,651
so I don't know which ones they were.

64
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:35,651
Was the mannequin the same as the one we just saw?

65
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:39,051
Yes, although they were all kind of whitish.

66
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:41,551
Then were the signs white, too?

67
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:42,651
Yes.

68
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:45,051
There seems to have been something stuck onto the front,

69
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,751
but it was all taken off.

70
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:50,551
Let's rush over to the 4th floor toy department!

71
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:54,851
Because she may be the most reliable eye-witness.

72
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:56,052
Yeah.

73
00:04:57,852 --> 00:04:59,451
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:03,451
You're talking about the time I took her over to the stairs, right?

75
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:07,451
My contacts fell out of place because I ran,

76
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:10,551
so everything was blurred and I couldn't see.

77
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:13,751
Is that so? Too bad.

78
00:05:13,752 --> 00:05:16,451
Don't you remember anything from back then?

79
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:18,851
Even if vaguely.

80
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,351
Well...

81
00:05:21,352 --> 00:05:24,851
I was waiting with her by the wall in front of the stairs

82
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:28,251
for the perp to come down.

83
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:29,951
When the person first appeared,

84
00:05:29,952 --> 00:05:32,751
the figure was silhouetted in the backlight from the window,

85
00:05:32,752 --> 00:05:35,552
so I don't think she got a good look at the person either.

86
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:40,251
It seems that the perp was standing in place for a while

87
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:42,251
in front of that window, though.

88
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:44,151
Standing in place?

89
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:46,151
Isn't that right?

90
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:49,351
Yep! It looked like that person was trying

91
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:50,951
to take something off from the sole of the left shoe.

92
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:53,151
What is that something?

93
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,351
Beats me.

94
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:57,951
Maybe chewing gum?

95
00:05:57,952 --> 00:05:59,751
I don't know.

96
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:03,051
Well, even if it were chewing gum,

97
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:05,951
it would've been disposed of already.

98
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:09,851
And the perp came down after that, right?

99
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,651
Couldn't you see the perp's face?

100
00:06:11,652 --> 00:06:12,851
Nope.

101
00:06:12,852 --> 00:06:14,951
I tried to look

102
00:06:14,952 --> 00:06:17,451
but a lot of boys who looked to be intermediate school

103
00:06:17,452 --> 00:06:20,951
or high school students came up the stairs,

104
00:06:20,952 --> 00:06:24,952
and the perp went down passing all those boys

105
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,751
so I couldn't see very well.

106
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:30,951
How did you know they were in intermediate school or high school?

107
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:34,551
Because they were all wearing the same clothes!

108
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:36,751
Same clothes?

109
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:38,651
Yep!

110
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:42,151
Come to think of it, students who were on a high school excursion

111
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,451
came to buy souvenirs.

112
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:48,051
They reminded me of the high school cheerleader I liked.

113
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:50,651
In my case, even flirty students look handsome

114
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:52,851
with their stand-up collars that hide their shallowness

115
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:55,851
and make them look good.

116
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:58,351
Hide...

117
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,051
and look?

118
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:04,051
Then those students must've seen the perp, too.

119
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:06,551
Do you know what high school they were from?

120
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:07,851
No.

121
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:10,551
There were two or three of them around just a while ago, though.

122
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:12,051
Darn it!

123
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:13,251
If we know which school,

124
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:16,051
maybe we can figure out who the perp is!

125
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:18,251
Don't worry.

126
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:21,252
I don't think that's necessary anymore.

127
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:26,151
Isn't that right, Detective?

128
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:29,151
Yeah, I've figured everything out.

129
00:07:29,152 --> 00:07:32,152
Why all your testimonies were different...

130
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:36,152
And who the perp is, too!

131
00:07:37,952 --> 00:07:40,551
Inspector, we found it!

132
00:07:40,552 --> 00:07:42,451
-You found it! -Yes, sir.

133
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:47,351
Inside the shrub near the phone booth by the department store.

134
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:49,551
The can of helium gas

135
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,751
that the perp seems to have used to change his voice

136
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:54,851
when calling the restaurant of the victim!

137
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:59,751
If so, the perp who changed his voice used the pay phone

138
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:02,451
and called the restaurant on the 10th floor of this department store

139
00:08:02,452 --> 00:08:04,751
and complained.

140
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:06,451
After making the call,

141
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,151
he rushed over to the stairs near the restaurant

142
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:12,651
and stabbed the chef who came to cope with the complaint,

143
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:16,051
then ran down the stairs and attempted to flee.

144
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:17,052
Yes.

145
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:21,951
The forensics are examining the pay phone and can of helium now,

146
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:25,551
but judging from the fact that there were no fingerprints on the knife,

147
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:28,852
we can't count on finding the perp's fingerprints.

148
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:33,051
Then maybe we have no other choice

149
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:35,051
but to wait till the victim regains consciousness.

150
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:37,751
No problem!

151
00:08:37,752 --> 00:08:39,951
Because I've figured out the perp,

152
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:42,251
thanks to their testimonies!

153
00:08:42,252 --> 00:08:43,652
What?

154
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:47,951
Right, Doc?

155
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:49,051
Yeah.

156
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:51,151
But, Conan...

157
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:54,351
The suspects that tried to flee hurriedly out of the department store

158
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:57,351
were Ms. Mitsuko Shikama, of small built, wearing light gray clothes,

159
00:08:57,352 --> 00:09:02,052
with a broche that looked like the number 6.

160
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:07,151
Mr. Masaru Miyadai, of big built, wearing a dark gray stadium jacket

161
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:11,151
with the logo mark of the Tokyo Spirits in the back.

162
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:15,351
And Mr. Takashi Kamaya of medium built and average height

163
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:18,751
wearing a gray parka that is neither dark or light

164
00:09:18,752 --> 00:09:21,851
with the kanji character (beika) on the back.

165
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:25,451
All your testimonies are different

166
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:28,851
and no one matches the description perfectly.

167
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:31,251
Then, would you like to actually try it out?

168
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:33,451
-Try it out? -Yep!

169
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:36,351
If we do so, I'm sure you'll see that

170
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:39,552
the different testimonies of everyone point to one person.

171
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:47,951
First, the 7th floor where the sporting goods are.

172
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:51,951
You saw the perp run down the stairs from here, right, Genta?

173
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:53,151
Yeah!

174
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:55,451
Yes...

175
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:59,351
They are?

176
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:02,051
The members of the basketball club that were here

177
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:04,151
at the time Genta saw the perp.

178
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:06,551
I called them and asked them to come.

179
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:08,151
I see.

180
00:10:08,152 --> 00:10:10,851
Then Genta, will you tell us once more

181
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:12,451
the characteristic of the perp you saw?

182
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:15,351
Okay! He was rather small

183
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:17,651
and was wearing gray colored clothes just like Ai's,

184
00:10:17,652 --> 00:10:20,251
with the number 2 on the back!

185
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,251
Then, Officer Chiba,

186
00:10:22,252 --> 00:10:26,051
will you line up with the members of the basketball club?

187
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:27,151
Okay.

188
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:30,151
Officer Chiba is a bit plump,

189
00:10:30,152 --> 00:10:34,051
and is of average height only a bit taller than Doc.

190
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:36,451
Plump...

191
00:10:36,452 --> 00:10:40,251
See? Surrounded by tall members of the basketball club

192
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:41,951
he looks small, doesn't he?

193
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:44,951
Yeah. Well, true.

194
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:48,151
The impression that you get when looking at something

195
00:10:48,152 --> 00:10:49,851
is influenced by the size of the things around you.

196
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:53,251
So even if it's the same size, it may look different!

197
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,851
I see.

198
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,651
Then next...

199
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:59,451
Officer Chiba! Will you carry Ai

200
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:03,551
and stand behind the members of the basketball club as if hiding?

201
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:05,251
Okay.

202
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:06,952
Sorry.

203
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:14,052
Hide a little more.

204
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,551
The button of Ai's clothes...

205
00:11:19,552 --> 00:11:22,152
It looks like the number 3!

206
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:24,851
Really.

207
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,751
If you hide both sides of the button,

208
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,551
it looks like a number 8, too!

209
00:11:29,552 --> 00:11:30,751
The uniform of the members of the basketball club

210
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:33,351
and Ai's clothes are both gray,

211
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:36,851
and there are numbers everywhere, that's why it looks that way!

212
00:11:36,852 --> 00:11:40,651
But I saw a number 2, you know?

213
00:11:40,652 --> 00:11:44,451
And? So who's the perp?

214
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:47,952
We'll have to go to the next floor to find out.

215
00:11:50,852 --> 00:11:52,651
Next, the stairs of the 5th floor

216
00:11:52,652 --> 00:11:55,152
where the camera shop that Mitsuhiko was at is!

217
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,451
Is this how it was?

218
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:03,251
Yes! More or less so.

219
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:06,251
Next, it's full of children's mannequins.

220
00:12:06,252 --> 00:12:09,051
There are a lot of sign stands, too.

221
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:12,851
The perp slipped through the mannequins and sign stands

222
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:16,051
and ran down the stairs!

223
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:19,451
I asked the department person to re-create the entire scene.

224
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:22,451
So that it would look just like when Mitsuhiko saw the perp!

225
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:24,051
I see.

226
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:27,851
And? What was the characteristic of the perp that you saw, Mitsuhiko?

227
00:12:27,852 --> 00:12:30,951
He was a large built man wearing dark gray clothes,

228
00:12:30,952 --> 00:12:33,651
who ran like a man.

229
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:37,351
Then, Officer Chiba, please line up with the mannequins!

230
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:38,851
Well, I don't have to line up

231
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:40,851
because it's exactly the opposite from the one before.

232
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:42,151
If I stand in here,

233
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:45,351
I can see that I would look to be a big person.

234
00:12:45,352 --> 00:12:46,851
Okay!

235
00:12:46,852 --> 00:12:51,551
Then, Ai, will you stand in front of that short sign stand?

236
00:12:51,552 --> 00:12:53,052
Yes, sir.

237
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:57,752
Will this do?

238
00:12:59,052 --> 00:13:01,451
Hey, Ai's clothes sort of looks...

239
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:03,751
It looks darker than before.

240
00:13:03,752 --> 00:13:05,351
You're right!

241
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:08,651
The mannequins and sign stands are white of high luminosity

242
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:11,351
so the color gray looks even darker.

243
00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:13,251
Just like the size,

244
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:16,751
color is also influenced by the colors around it!

245
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:20,851
This is called "luminosity contrast". Right, Dr. Agasa?

246
00:13:20,852 --> 00:13:22,151
Yeah.

247
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:23,451
I see!

248
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:26,951
Which means that the clothes of the perp that Mitsuhiko saw

249
00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:30,051
was more likely a darker gray.

250
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:31,351
Yeah.

251
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,451
And? Who's the perp?

252
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:35,652
Okay, let's go on to the next step!

253
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,352
Gosh.

254
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:50,033
And finally, Ayumi!

255
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:51,333
You saw the perp

256
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:54,133
by the stairs of the 4th floor where the toy department is.

257
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,633
After hearing from me,

258
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,733
the salesclerk took you to the stairs

259
00:13:57,734 --> 00:14:01,033
where you were waiting for the perp to come down, right?

260
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:02,133
Yep!

261
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:05,033
And? What kind of a person was the perp?

262
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:07,333
At first, because of the light from the window,

263
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:10,233
all I could see was a dark figure of a person,

264
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:13,533
but I had a feeling it was a lady!

265
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:17,033
After that, the person came down the stairs,

266
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:19,633
wearing light gray clothes, was about average height,

267
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:23,633
a little taller than Dr. Agasa.

268
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:26,033
In other words, about the height of Officer Chiba.

269
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:28,733
Sorry to keep you waiting.

270
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,633
What can we do to help you with the case?

271
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:32,833
What?

272
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:36,134
Can you stand surrounding her?

273
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:38,934
Me again?

274
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:45,433
Hey, Ai's clothes... This time...

275
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:48,333
Looks like a lighter gray than before.

276
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:49,933
Yes, it does, it does!

277
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:51,433
In contrast to what you saw before,

278
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:53,433
since the surrounding is black of low luminosity,

279
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,334
the color that it is surrounded by looks lighter than it actually is!

280
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:01,033
When Ayumi saw the perp,

281
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:05,333
it seems he passed students who were on excursion

282
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:08,633
so I asked the member of the basketball club

283
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:11,133
to ask their friends to come here wearing their uniforms

284
00:15:11,134 --> 00:15:15,133
because we want help in catching the perp who stabbed a person!

285
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:18,733
And? So, who's the perp, anyway?

286
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:20,433
If you were to exclude from the testimonies

287
00:15:20,434 --> 00:15:22,933
the size of the person that was influenced by the surroundings,

288
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:24,233
the number 2 that may have been mistakenly seen

289
00:15:24,234 --> 00:15:26,533
among the colors and many numbers around,

290
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:28,433
and the testimony about the perp being a woman

291
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:31,033
just because the witness felt that way.

292
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:33,933
The height of the perp was about average, a little taller than Doc,

293
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,733
the clothes was the same color gray as Ai's clothes,

294
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:41,633
and someone who ran like a man, right?

295
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:44,133
There's only one person that matches that description!

296
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:46,233
I see!

297
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:47,934
In other words, the perp is...

298
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:53,333
Hey, hey. Give me a break!

299
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:56,333
What makes me the perp?

300
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:59,933
All you got is the vague testimonies of those brats!

301
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:03,233
There are three testimonies that are definite.

302
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:05,933
His height is a little taller than Dr. Agasa.

303
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:07,833
His clothes are the same color gray as the one Ai is wearing,

304
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,233
and that he walks like a man.

305
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:13,733
The one who matches all these descriptions is nobody else

306
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:16,033
but you, Mr. Takashi Kamaya!

307
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:20,933
But my clothes have no number 2 on it,

308
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:23,033
nor am I a lady!

309
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:25,833
The brats were saying so, right?

310
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,433
Brats?

311
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:28,833
Huh?

312
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:32,434
There's something on the sole of your left shoe, sir!

313
00:16:33,634 --> 00:16:35,733
It's just plain chewing gum!

314
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:38,533
I stepped on it somewhere in the department store.

315
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:42,033
Hey. There's no gum stuck on it?

316
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,233
He's doing the same thing the perp did!

317
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:45,433
What?

318
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:46,633
Right.

319
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:49,233
In case something gets stuck to the sole of your left shoe,

320
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:52,433
men usually bring their shoe to the front

321
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:54,133
and try to remove whatever is stuck with their right hand.

322
00:16:54,134 --> 00:16:59,033
Because men unlike women find it hard to bend their hips outward.

323
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:02,533
But you couldn't use your right hand because of your sprained finger.

324
00:17:02,534 --> 00:17:04,233
That's why you bent your left leg

325
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:06,933
in a difficult position backwards outwardly, raised it,

326
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:09,633
and removed the gum with your left hand!

327
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:12,833
Ayumi, who saw your silhouette against the backlight from the window,

328
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:15,033
saw you doing this

329
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,134
and intuitively thought that you were a woman!

330
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:21,133
That's...

331
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:24,133
Even that lady over there would do the same, right?

332
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:27,434
Then, carry your knapsack on your back!

333
00:17:28,534 --> 00:17:30,833
Then, I think we'll be able to see

334
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:34,333
the number that would point out the perp.

335
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:36,833
Can't you do it?

336
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:39,434
Fine. Like this?

337
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:44,034
It's the number 2!

338
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:49,033
That's the number 2 that I saw!

339
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,533
-No joke? -I see.

340
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:53,833
The "ka" of the word Beika is cut in half

341
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:57,234
hidden by the knapsack and looks like the number 2.

342
00:17:59,734 --> 00:18:04,833
Which means that all your testimonies were correct.

343
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,233
Yep.

344
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:10,133
So, will you come to the station with me?

345
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:11,933
Wait!

346
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:14,433
You still don't have proof that I'm the perp.

347
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:16,733
Inspector Megure!

348
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:20,033
We got saliva from the suction hole of the can of helium gas!

349
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:21,133
And?

350
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:24,433
If we can get DNA from the saliva,

351
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:26,834
we'll be able to specify who it belongs to.

352
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:32,433
Which means if that DNA is yours,

353
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:36,133
you'll give us a plausible explanation, won't you?

354
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:38,733
Of why you used the pay phone near this department

355
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:39,933
after changing your voice,

356
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:43,034
called who and for what.

357
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:50,933
I thought that he'd know who I was unless I changed my voice.

358
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:54,033
I quit the restaurant 2 years ago,

359
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:58,133
and yet the chef remembered who I was.

360
00:18:58,134 --> 00:19:02,333
Did you stab him because you were fired?

361
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:06,133
Even I wouldn't stab somebody just because I was fired!

362
00:19:06,134 --> 00:19:12,333
I took my girlfriend to eat at that restaurant the other day.

363
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:16,533
I hid the fact that I part-timed there two years ago.

364
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:18,233
It's so surprising that you know

365
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:20,533
such a classy restaurant like this, Takashi!

366
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,534
I may not look it

367
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,933
but I'm quite knowledgeable when it comes to food, you know!

368
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:27,033
I used to watch the chef cook.

369
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:29,533
I dyed my hair black and shaved

370
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:32,633
so I didn't think he'd recognized me. That's why I called him to our table.

371
00:19:32,634 --> 00:19:36,133
The hidden ingredient you have in this marinade is honey, isn't it?

372
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:39,133
My taste buds can't be fooled.

373
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:41,333
But that chef...

374
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:43,733
No, I used a small amount of jam.

375
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:46,633
I can't tell you what kind of jam it is because that's company secret.

376
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:48,733
What?

377
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:50,333
But in the past...

378
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:53,633
Yes. I used to use honey

379
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:56,133
before to mellow out the sour taste.

380
00:19:56,134 --> 00:19:58,433
What? Aren't you...

381
00:19:58,434 --> 00:20:00,933
Mr. Kamaya who used to part-time at our restaurant?

382
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,734
What? No...

383
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:09,633
Well, I was worried that maybe I was a bit too tough on you.

384
00:20:09,634 --> 00:20:12,934
Because you were crying when you quit back then.

385
00:20:15,134 --> 00:20:17,834
No, that's...

386
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:24,033
Because of him, she got fed up with me

387
00:20:24,034 --> 00:20:26,333
and dumped me.

388
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:29,233
I finally got her to come back to me and yet

389
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:31,933
all because of that Chef.

390
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:34,733
Just because of that man...

391
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,133
But I didn't intend to kill him!

392
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:41,833
I just wanted to scare him using a knife,

393
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:44,933
and see his terrified face!

394
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:47,133
He's not dead.

395
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:49,633
The hospital called a while ago

396
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:51,333
and said that he regained his consciousness.

397
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,633
What?

398
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:56,233
Chef Hosogoe seems to have requested

399
00:20:56,234 --> 00:20:58,933
not to publicize the name of the person who stabbed him

400
00:20:58,934 --> 00:21:02,833
until the perp himself turns himself in.

401
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:04,133
Because he still considers you

402
00:21:04,134 --> 00:21:06,333
a colleague who he worked together with in the past

403
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:08,334
and shared the same kitchen.

404
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:13,134
It's like he's disclosing who the perp is.

405
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:17,833
You completely got him wrong.

406
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:20,434
It's so disgusting, it's not even worth getting angry over.

407
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:48,933
Okay, Doc.

408
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,133
Isn't it about time...

409
00:22:50,134 --> 00:22:52,233
To give it to us...

410
00:22:52,234 --> 00:22:54,834
Our Christmas present?

411
00:22:56,634 --> 00:22:58,633
So you remembered, after all.

412
00:22:58,634 --> 00:23:00,434
Of course...

413
00:23:01,634 --> 00:23:06,633
I haven't given up on the Fusae brand new pouch yet either.

414
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:10,134
Hey, Ai. That's enough joking around already.

415
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:13,534
What?

416
00:23:15,434 --> 00:23:19,134
What's wrong? Is there anything on my face?

417
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,233
You got...

418
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:25,333
Black stuff by your eyes!

419
00:23:25,334 --> 00:23:26,334
No way!

420
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:28,333
It's mascara, right?

421
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:30,433
Gosh.

422
00:23:30,434 --> 00:23:33,733
I thought I removed it nice and clean in the restroom and yet.

423
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:35,733
Ai.

424
00:23:35,734 --> 00:23:38,034
You... That face of yours...

425
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:45,033
"Next Episode"

426
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:46,933
What on earth...

427
00:23:46,934 --> 00:23:49,033
Why am I in a place like this?

428
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:51,333
I see.

429
00:23:51,334 --> 00:23:53,333
You realized this morning?

430
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:54,833
"No Signal"

431
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,333
No response?

432
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,134
Safe breaker?

433
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:03,233
Dry ice?

434
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:06,434
Don't tell me I'm inside a coffin?

435
00:24:07,334 --> 00:24:12,734
