1
00:00:02,094 --> 00:00:05,194
While we were waiting at the office of Ran's mom,

2
00:00:05,194 --> 00:00:07,794
we met the former All-Japan women's judo champion.

3
00:00:07,794 --> 00:00:09,294
"Yuko Arisawa (37)" -in the 70kg class,

4
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:11,294
Yuko Arisawa.

5
00:00:12,294 --> 00:00:15,294
When her husband, Shiro requested Lawyer Kisaki, Ran's mom

6
00:00:15,294 --> 00:00:17,494
for a consultation over a recent stalker problem.

7
00:00:17,494 --> 00:00:20,994
A meeting was set to meet with them.

8
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:24,294
Since Shiro suddenly received a call to attend a wake,

9
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:27,294
the appointment was re-set for 9:30.

10
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:32,694
However, when we got there...

11
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:36,694
We found Shiro strangled to death.

12
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:40,994
I and Lawyer Kisaki began to find Yuko's behavior suspicious.

13
00:00:40,994 --> 00:00:42,894
But she has a solid alibi,

14
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:45,594
since she had been having dinner with us at that time.

15
00:00:45,594 --> 00:00:46,694
The only time she could've committed the murder

16
00:00:46,694 --> 00:00:49,194
was the 10 minutes that she left to go to the restroom.

17
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:53,894
Could it have been possible for her to kill Shiro in such a short time,

18
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:56,194
when she didn't even know where the wake was being held?

19
00:00:59,694 --> 00:01:01,594
A catch-22 crisis is gracefully revived.

20
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,894
The table is turned and the mystery solved!

21
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:05,594
Kogoro and Eri combined deduction.

22
00:01:05,594 --> 00:01:08,094
Makes a tag-team move on the case.

23
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:09,694
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,794
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:13,794
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

26
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:54,133
"Might over Mystery (Part 2)"

27
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:57,165
Maybe they have call forwarding.

28
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:58,665
That way, if Yuko called here from your office,

29
00:02:58,665 --> 00:03:01,065
the call would be forwarded to his cell!

30
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:03,465
You know, when you try calling several times

31
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:07,265
and there is no answer.

32
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:09,565
Unfortunately, that's not the case.

33
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:10,665
What?

34
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:13,365
The truth is, before you two made it to the office,

35
00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:15,665
I called here.

36
00:03:15,665 --> 00:03:18,965
It was in order to confirm the appointment for tonight.

37
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,065
But the call wasn't forwarded,

38
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:23,865
it went to the answering machine after ten rings.

39
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:27,983
Then, maybe her husband hadn't come home yet,

40
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:30,383
so she called his cell.

41
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:32,883
It wasn't just that phone that's bothering me.

42
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:36,483
Near the closet where the body was discovered

43
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,483
is the door to the garage,

44
00:03:39,483 --> 00:03:42,083
but the trash bag there was strange.

45
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,983
What? How so?

46
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:47,583
Maybe it was just placed there to make taking it out easier?

47
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:51,383
No. The problem's not where it was, but rather the contents.

48
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:52,783
A large amount of matchbooks

49
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:55,283
from the western-style restaurant we ate earlier

50
00:03:55,283 --> 00:03:59,583
was found at the bottom of the trash bag.

51
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,783
Since she doesn't smoke,

52
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:06,183
it's probably what her heavy-smoker husband brought home with him.

53
00:04:06,183 --> 00:04:10,483
In other words, he's also a regular customer at that same restaurant.

54
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:15,083
But if so, why did she say her husband wasn't interested in food,

55
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:19,183
and so she frequented that restaurant alone?

56
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:22,983
If that's the case, why don't you talk it over with Dad?

57
00:04:22,983 --> 00:04:26,183
-What? -Maybe he can find a hint!

58
00:04:30,783 --> 00:04:33,683
I'd rather sell my soul to the devil!

59
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:35,083
Gosh.

60
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,183
The devil, huh?

61
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,883
What? You found wiretaps?

62
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:43,283
-Five of them? -Yes, sir!

63
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,783
It seems certain that the victim was the target of a stalker.

64
00:04:47,783 --> 00:04:51,483
We also found two queer items in the victim's clothing.

65
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:53,683
-Two? -Yes.

66
00:04:53,683 --> 00:04:57,283
One of them was found in the inside the pocket of his slacks.

67
00:04:57,283 --> 00:04:59,183
This wedding ring.

68
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:03,883
What? Then, the victim's missing ring wasn't taken after all.

69
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,383
It seems that he took it off for some reason

70
00:05:05,383 --> 00:05:08,083
and put it in his pocket.

71
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:11,283
And the other?

72
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:12,683
Yes.

73
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:16,683
In his coat pocket, we found this black necktie.

74
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:20,483
Could this be the murder weapon?

75
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:24,183
No, because there aren't any wrinkles on it,

76
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:27,183
and it doesn't even look like it's been opened.

77
00:05:27,183 --> 00:05:30,083
Which means it's not the murder weapon?

78
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,283
Yeah.

79
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:35,183
Come on, let's give Dad a call.

80
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:37,683
Dad did say he was going drinking

81
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:39,283
with the master of Poirot and others tonight,

82
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:42,583
but I'm sure he's not drunk yet.

83
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:46,083
Hey, Mom. Say something!

84
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,583
Geez, be quiet! Just quiet down a little!

85
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,083
Hello, Dad?

86
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,983
Mom has something she wants to talk to you about!

87
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,883
What? Eri does?

88
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:01,983
-Here! -Hey!

89
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,383
Well, I doubt think it'll do much good.

90
00:06:05,383 --> 00:06:07,283
It's me.

91
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,683
Well, it's not really anything important, but...

92
00:06:09,683 --> 00:06:13,083
If it's not anything important, then don't call, idiot!

93
00:06:14,383 --> 00:06:17,083
Stop! Don't hang up!

94
00:06:19,283 --> 00:06:21,083
Yeah, yeah, I see.

95
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:26,083
So, you suspect the former All-Japan champion.

96
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,383
But when the crime occurred, she was with all of you,

97
00:06:29,383 --> 00:06:33,183
and since she didn't even know where the victim went to a wake,

98
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:34,983
you say it was impossible for her to commit the crime?

99
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:36,483
Yeah.

100
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,683
Then, the answer is simple.

101
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:40,783
That woman is innocent!

102
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:43,283
-What? -That's it, isn't it?

103
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:47,083
Her alibi is solid and the best evidence is that,

104
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,783
you answered the call from the victim yourself!

105
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:52,883
But there are other things that bother me about her.

106
00:06:52,883 --> 00:06:55,283
-Ron! -Ron?

107
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:59,683
Sorry. I'm playing mahjong with the neighbors.

108
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:01,183
Well, that's the story.

109
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:02,783
So, if you want to find the culprit,

110
00:07:02,783 --> 00:07:05,983
I suggest you go looking elsewhere.

111
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,883
What did Dad say?

112
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:11,783
He says he's busy playing mahjong, so to go look somewhere else.

113
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:14,883
I know he's not playing mahjong.

114
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:16,583
It was recording, a tape recording!

115
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,683
I know because he used it a number of times in the past

116
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:20,783
when he used to be a police detective!

117
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:23,883
It was the same sound as what he used to use back then, too.

118
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:27,083
What? What do you mean by sound?

119
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:31,083
In other words, if he doesn't want to let you know his whereabouts,

120
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,783
or when he wants to hang up right away, he used to...

121
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:39,983
That's it. Her husband didn't want her to know.

122
00:07:39,983 --> 00:07:43,283
That was the reason for the underhanded trick.

123
00:07:43,283 --> 00:07:45,683
Could it be that his trick was seen through without his being aware that

124
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:48,283
the trick would be carried out on him instead?

125
00:07:52,783 --> 00:07:56,083
Despite the various unexplained points that remain,

126
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,283
we can assume that the stalker using the wiretap

127
00:07:58,283 --> 00:07:59,883
found out that no one was at home.

128
00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:01,983
While the culprit was ransacking something,

129
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:04,683
Shiro happened to return from his friend's wake,

130
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:06,083
and encountered the culprit.

131
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,883
The necktie Shiro was wearing, was taken from him

132
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:10,283
and he was strangled to death.

133
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:13,883
Shiro probably wasn't wearing his necktie or his wedding ring

134
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:16,283
because he was getting ready to take a bath.

135
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:20,283
I see! The stalker was hiding in the bathroom!

136
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:22,083
Shiro found him,

137
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,483
so the culprit strangled him with the necktie that Shrio had taken off.

138
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:25,883
The only remaining question is just

139
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:33,083
why Shiro had an unopened black tie package in his suit pocket.

140
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,383
Perhaps someone asked him to buy it?

141
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:37,683
Wakes are generally held without warning.

142
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,983
Maybe one of his colleagues

143
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:41,283
that had to go to the wake directly from work,

144
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:43,183
asked him to buy the tie

145
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:46,583
but ended up not being able to make it.

146
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,083
I see.

147
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,883
If so, it's understandable that

148
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:51,883
he'd have a brand new extra tie on him!

149
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:56,383
At any rate, at around 9:00 p.m.,

150
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:58,783
that is, the time the murder was committed

151
00:08:58,783 --> 00:09:00,483
after finishing the dinner with Shiro's wife Yuko,

152
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:02,583
we were about to leave the hotel restaurant

153
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,483
that is a 10 minute drive from here.

154
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:07,983
So, we've got nothing to do with this case.

155
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:09,683
May we leave now?

156
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:12,083
I... I guess so.

157
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,783
For the time being, we need to find out

158
00:09:14,783 --> 00:09:17,283
whether or not anyone suspicious was seen leaving the house.

159
00:09:17,283 --> 00:09:18,783
Go and look into that.

160
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:20,283
Yes, sir!

161
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:23,883
-Yuko. -Yeah?

162
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:28,283
May I speak to you in the living room for a moment?

163
00:09:28,283 --> 00:09:30,083
Sure.

164
00:09:33,483 --> 00:09:37,083
So? What's it about?

165
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,083
Article 42, sub-paragraph 01 of the penal code...

166
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,083
What?

167
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,483
Criminal offenders who turn themselves in

168
00:09:42,483 --> 00:09:46,083
before authorities discover anything

169
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,983
will have their sentence reduced.

170
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:53,883
That's why I want you to turn yourself in

171
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:58,283
for strangling your husband.

172
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:07,047
Wait! Is this some sort of joke?

173
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:09,447
Didn't you say so earlier?

174
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:11,647
That at the approximate time of the murder, around 9:00,

175
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:15,447
I had just finished having dinner with you at the hotel restaurant

176
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,347
and was about to leave.

177
00:10:17,347 --> 00:10:20,947
But just before leaving, you went to the restroom, didn't you?

178
00:10:20,947 --> 00:10:23,347
Just for 10 minutes, right?

179
00:10:23,347 --> 00:10:25,147
What could I have done in such a short time?

180
00:10:25,147 --> 00:10:26,347
Within the 10 minutes,

181
00:10:26,347 --> 00:10:29,247
you could've pretended to go to the restroom, leave the restaurant,

182
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:33,547
commit the crime and come back to the restaurant, couldn't you?

183
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:37,747
For you, the former All-Japan judo champion in the 70kg class

184
00:10:37,747 --> 00:10:40,647
and for you who currently train others as the coach of a dojo,

185
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:42,347
it's possible!

186
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:44,547
What're you talking about?

187
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:47,447
How could I have called my husband over to the hotel

188
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,947
when I didn't even know whose wake he was at?

189
00:10:49,947 --> 00:10:52,547
You didn't need to call him over

190
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:56,047
because your husband was already at the hotel.

191
00:10:57,147 --> 00:10:58,747
"Already" there?

192
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:00,247
You heard him too, didn't you?

193
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:04,047
His voice on the phone saying he was at a wake!

194
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:07,647
So I came to the wake.

195
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,447
You can hear the chanting, can't you?

196
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:12,847
Don't tell me you're denying hearing that!

197
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:16,147
The chanting was from a tape.

198
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:18,647
It was to hide his extra-marital affair, wasn't it?

199
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:19,947
Extra-marital ffair?

200
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:22,947
My dorky husband use to use the same trick

201
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:24,447
when he used work for as a police detective!

202
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:28,147
He would play a recording of patrol car sirens next to the phone

203
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:29,447
and say "A sudden case has come up,

204
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:33,147
so I'll be home late, go to bed without me."

205
00:11:33,147 --> 00:11:36,947
That guy was actually drinking at a cabaret club!

206
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,547
Mom...

207
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:40,547
I don't see your point in getting angry.

208
00:11:40,547 --> 00:11:43,847
But that was in the case of your husband,

209
00:11:43,847 --> 00:11:45,747
my husband would never do that.

210
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,047
Prior to taking a bath, do you normally remove your wedding band

211
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:52,947
and store it in your pocket?

212
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:56,947
Now, if he were going out to meet someone else,

213
00:11:56,947 --> 00:11:59,247
it would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?

214
00:12:01,547 --> 00:12:06,047
And as for that unopened black tie...

215
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:08,247
He planned to put it on before returning home

216
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:11,147
in order to make it look like he had been to a wake.

217
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,147
However, before he could do that,

218
00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:17,247
you strangled him with the tie which he took off, didn't you?

219
00:12:17,247 --> 00:12:19,947
And further evidence is the restaurant matchbooks

220
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,047
that were found in the trash bag by the garage door.

221
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:26,847
Your heavy smoker husband brought them back, right?

222
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,447
You also mentioned that

223
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:32,347
you go to the restaurant on a weekly basis.

224
00:12:32,347 --> 00:12:35,347
This would mean you both visited that restaurant often.

225
00:12:35,347 --> 00:12:37,947
Then, why did you say you only go alone?

226
00:12:37,947 --> 00:12:40,247
I come alone without telling him.

227
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:42,647
My husband has zero tolerance for new food.

228
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:45,047
Yes. Even though you always went there alone,

229
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:47,847
your husband always had somebody with him.

230
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:50,047
You saw them, didn't you?

231
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,047
Your husband happily enjoying a meal with another woman.

232
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:58,147
They always used that hotel to have an affair.

233
00:12:58,147 --> 00:13:01,247
You found out that they were going to have an affair tonight

234
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,647
so you set up wiretaps in the house

235
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:05,947
and fabricated the story of a stalker.

236
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:12,047
Then, you invited us to that hotel restaurant for dinner.

237
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:16,647
When you contacted your husband on the phone from my office,

238
00:13:16,647 --> 00:13:18,347
you expected him to play something in the background

239
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:20,647
that he'd prepared as an alibi,

240
00:13:20,647 --> 00:13:22,747
and also predicted he would say

241
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:25,247
he'd be home late and not to wait up for him.

242
00:13:25,247 --> 00:13:26,547
At just about the same time

243
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:28,247
that your husband would leave his extra-marital partner

244
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:32,047
and leave the hotel room, you left to go to the restroom.

245
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:34,647
You then caught your husband in the parking lot

246
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,447
where you proceeded to drag him to your car and strangled him!

247
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:42,647
Next, you put him in the trunk of your car

248
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:46,747
and came back as if nothing had happen.

249
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:49,247
Afterwards, you drove both us and his dead body

250
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:51,347
together back to your house.

251
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:54,347
You instructed us to wait here in the living room

252
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:57,947
while you transported his body from the trunk to the closet.

253
00:13:57,947 --> 00:14:00,447
And lastly, you called him so we would discover the body.

254
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:05,347
Well, am I wrong?

255
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,147
That story sure sounds like a plausible one.

256
00:14:11,147 --> 00:14:12,547
Do you have any proof?

257
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:16,347
We can probably find out by checking the hotel parking lot.

258
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:18,747
Your husband, who headed home,

259
00:14:18,747 --> 00:14:20,547
had to come alone to the parking lot

260
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:22,647
or the crime couldn't have been committed!

261
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:25,047
That's why, it should still be there!

262
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:29,347
The car that your husband drove to the hotel in!

263
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:30,947
Because if your husband used his lover's car

264
00:14:30,947 --> 00:14:32,547
to go in and out of the hotel,

265
00:14:32,547 --> 00:14:35,947
you would never have chosen the parking lot to commit the crime,

266
00:14:35,947 --> 00:14:40,347
not wanting to risk your face being seen.

267
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:44,447
The garage here only has space for one car.

268
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:48,347
Most likely, your husband rented a car behind your back.

269
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:52,347
Then, why not investigate it? That hotel parking lot!

270
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:55,847
And, should you not find a car like that,

271
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:57,247
I will not, despite it being you, attorney at law, Kisaki

272
00:14:57,247 --> 00:15:00,347
-get away with it. -Say!

273
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:02,947
Mrs. Arisawa, you're really good at judo, right?

274
00:15:02,947 --> 00:15:06,247
-What? -Wait, Conan!

275
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:09,647
Could you teach me the inner thigh throw?

276
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:12,547
That's when you use your opponent's attacking power

277
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:14,947
to your advantage and throw them, right?

278
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,447
You use their power to throw them to the ground

279
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:18,847
and gain points, right?

280
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:22,347
Using your opponent's power to your advantage...

281
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:24,447
Geez! What are you up to?

282
00:15:24,447 --> 00:15:25,747
But back then,

283
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:30,947
didn't Mrs. Arisawa teach us how to adjust our seats?

284
00:15:30,947 --> 00:15:33,247
You know how to adjust the seat, don't you?

285
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:34,547
There's a lever on the right side of the seat.

286
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:36,047
And if you pull it...

287
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:39,147
See, like this, the seat will move.

288
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:41,447
I see.

289
00:15:41,447 --> 00:15:46,047
The car that you ended up driving us back in...

290
00:15:46,047 --> 00:15:49,447
That was the car your husband drove to the hotel, was it not?

291
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:56,147
That's why you demonstrated how to adjust the seat, right?

292
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:58,447
Your husband is smaller and shorter than you.

293
00:15:58,447 --> 00:16:01,247
It's natural for his seat to be in a different position.

294
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:06,847
Should you adjust it on a whim, it would look suspicious.

295
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:08,147
That's right.

296
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:12,147
That would also explain your adjusting of the rear-view mirror.

297
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:15,047
Which means it should come as no surprise

298
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:18,447
why you couldn't find the car in the parking lot.

299
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:21,747
Most likely, you trailed him closely

300
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,047
and avoided letting him take notice of you.

301
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:26,447
You probably got into the car

302
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:29,647
at the same time your husband got on and strangled him.

303
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:33,947
Afterwards, you most likely rushed back full speed to the restaurant.

304
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:36,547
And, due to this, you didn't have enough time

305
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:39,647
to remember the car position, right?

306
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:42,547
If you think about it, it's really a strange story.

307
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:46,147
Your reason for inviting us to that hotel

308
00:16:46,147 --> 00:16:48,747
was because you could get a discount for parking.

309
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:53,547
Then, you should've shown the ticket when you paid the parking fee.

310
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:55,347
Despite not having gone anywhere else,

311
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,847
the ticket was suspiciously missing.

312
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:01,247
This is peculiar, isn't it?

313
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:04,047
When you said you had lost the ticket, what you really meant was

314
00:17:04,047 --> 00:17:08,347
that you weren't sure where your husband put it, right?

315
00:17:08,347 --> 00:17:11,447
If your husband were the type to put things away at random,

316
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,247
it could be behind the sun visor

317
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:15,547
or even in the ashtray.

318
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:17,747
With a proper search of the car,

319
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:19,247
I imagine we'll find it.

320
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:23,247
The hotel parking ticket with your husband's fingerprints on it.

321
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:25,247
That would be proof that

322
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,847
your husband was also at the hotel tonight.

323
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,347
Well, if we check the trunk,

324
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:35,247
we should find evidence that he was moved from there.

325
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:36,847
Maybe his hair

326
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,247
and possibly even the tie used as a weapon,

327
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:41,947
as well as his shoes.

328
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:46,347
And as for the shoes that we saw at the front entrance tonight,

329
00:17:46,347 --> 00:17:49,147
those were likely prepared by you.

330
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:52,547
Now, before the police come across this evidence,

331
00:17:52,547 --> 00:17:54,247
hurry and turn yourself in.

332
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:57,147
-The sock on his left foot... -What?

333
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:58,947
I just remembered.

334
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:02,947
That's where my husband usually puts his parking tickets.

335
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:05,547
So if they check there, they should find it.

336
00:18:05,547 --> 00:18:08,247
Then, Yuko really did...

337
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:09,747
But why?

338
00:18:09,747 --> 00:18:14,347
How could someone like you esort to murder over a mere affair?

339
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:18,347
If it were only an affair, a divorce would have sufficed,

340
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,747
but the other woman was Kajimoto's wife.

341
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:23,847
I just couldn't allow it.

342
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:25,447
Mr. Kajimoto...

343
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:28,047
That's the gold medallist you mentioned before, right?

344
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:31,947
But wouldn't that give you even mere reason to work it out?

345
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:35,047
It isn't like you weren't acquainted with his wife.

346
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,147
Yeah, my husband and I

347
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:40,747
visited Kajimoto's house often in the past.

348
00:18:40,747 --> 00:18:44,047
Such a good wife, such a cute child...

349
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:46,947
They were the ideal family you see in pictures.

350
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:49,347
But my husband ruined it!

351
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:55,647
When I considered the suffering that was to come,

352
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:58,247
I couldn't live on that way.

353
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:00,747
Not even a divorce would've been enough!

354
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:05,247
Right. I never should've gotten close.

355
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:08,447
If only we never visited Mr. Kajimoto's house,

356
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,947
my husband and his wife wouldn't have met.

357
00:19:11,947 --> 00:19:13,947
If only I had kept my admiration to myself,

358
00:19:13,947 --> 00:19:17,147
none of this would have come to be.

359
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:20,847
This is merely an assumption.

360
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:24,947
Could it be that your husband just wanted more attention from you?

361
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:27,747
-What? -The tape trick for an alibi

362
00:19:27,747 --> 00:19:29,347
would have only worked two, maybe three times.

363
00:19:29,347 --> 00:19:30,847
After that, it doesn't work anymore.

364
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:35,047
And, when it comes to those matches from the restaurant...

365
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:38,547
He may as well have told you directly that he went there often.

366
00:19:38,547 --> 00:19:40,247
Are you saying my husband

367
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:42,347
deliberately wanted me to think he was having an affair?

368
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,947
Yes. He was jealous

369
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:48,447
that you still thought of Mr. Kajimoto despite being married.

370
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:51,247
That can't be...

371
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:55,847
But he crossed the line and angered you, caught fire,

372
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:57,747
and plunged to his death.

373
00:19:57,747 --> 00:20:02,147
Maybe the sun that burned Icarus's wings

374
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:04,747
was actually you.

375
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:12,347
-It was all thanks to Dad! -What?

376
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:15,047
You know, the alibi tapes!

377
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,047
A coincidence! Just a coincidence!

378
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:18,747
Definitely an accidental hit!

379
00:20:18,747 --> 00:20:20,947
Was it really a coincidence?

380
00:20:20,947 --> 00:20:25,847
What if it was a deliberate hint just for Mom?

381
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:28,847
No way.

382
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:31,447
He was probably too embarrassed to say anything!

383
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:33,147
Is that so?

384
00:20:33,147 --> 00:20:35,547
If you want to find out, here's the phone!

385
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:40,747
Well, I should at least inform him that the case is over.

386
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:45,347
It's me.

387
00:20:45,347 --> 00:20:47,447
About the case...

388
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:53,047
Sorry, I'm still playing mahjong.

389
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:55,147
Silly, still using those tapes.

390
00:20:55,147 --> 00:20:57,547
Kogoro, hurry!

391
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,947
Darn it!

392
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:02,247
This is...

393
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:06,247
What?

394
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:09,547
As I thought, it was just a coincidence.

395
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:11,347
How do you know?

396
00:21:11,347 --> 00:21:14,847
Mom! Wait up!

397
00:22:40,947 --> 00:22:43,247
It looks like Pop's back already.

398
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:45,547
Oh, really? Who cares!

399
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:47,547
Lewd old man!

400
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:51,847
"Tonight's drinking party has been canceled!"

401
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:54,447
"Sorry about that, Kogorou. - Poirot Master."

402
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:02,047
I see.

403
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,447
Since he'd used this strategy so often before,

404
00:23:04,447 --> 00:23:06,947
he saw throught it instantly.

405
00:23:06,947 --> 00:23:08,847
And he was able to find his own alibi tapes so quickly

406
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:11,447
because he skipped on the party.

407
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:18,147
Then, he tried to play it one more time over the last call, but...

408
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,847
Kogoro, hurry!

409
00:23:20,847 --> 00:23:23,747
Next, we'll have a friend of the groom, Kogoro Mouri,

410
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:24,747
give a congratulatory speech!

411
00:23:24,747 --> 00:23:26,347
Thank you!

412
00:23:27,847 --> 00:23:30,547
What a bad luck, recording that part

413
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:32,447
and accidentally playing it as well.

414
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,247
Yes, quite a pity!

415
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:38,147
Eri! Don't be fooled!

416
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:40,447
Do your best!

417
00:23:42,647 --> 00:23:44,447
You too, Pops!

418
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:52,247
Because it's hard to believe that

419
00:23:52,247 --> 00:23:54,947
we're staking out accompanied by girl high school students

420
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:58,247
and an elementary school child, right?

421
00:23:58,247 --> 00:24:00,247
That goes for Hammer man, too.

422
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:03,247
It can't be...

423
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:05,647
He's waiting to ambush us?

424
00:24:05,647 --> 00:24:06,847
No.

425
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:10,647
I don't think he had any intention to ambush anybody.

426
00:24:11,247 --> 00:24:16,747
Next Conan, "The Truth of the Urban Legend (Part 1)"

427
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:34,547
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:36,747
"Hammer man."

429
00:24:36,747 --> 00:24:39,047
Next story is a love story.

430
00:24:39,047 --> 00:24:40,947
Please stay happy.
