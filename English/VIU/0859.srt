-Camping... -Camping...

2
00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:04,390
-We're going camping. -We're going camping.

3
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:06,491
Amazing!

4
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:09,991
She's climbing that wall.

5
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:16,590
The river's on this side.

6
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:18,091
They're kayaking downstream.

7
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:23,791
How beautiful.

8
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,791
Wait.

9
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,890
They're valuable alpine plants

10
00:00:26,891 --> 00:00:28,190
so don't pick them.

11
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:31,290
-Okay. -Hurry, let's go.

12
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,590
You're going to take a panorama photo of the town

13
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:36,190
and use it for your science project, right?

14
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:37,290
Let's go.

15
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,291
-Okay! -Okay.

16
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:40,890
"Mount Kumomaru, Cottage Entrance" -Enough!

17
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:41,891
What?

18
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:44,590
-Aren't they the people we just saw? -What are you guys always like that?

19
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:47,390
You come late and tell us to prepare the meal.

20
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:49,890
"Takemi Yamakura (26)" -Shut up, what's the problem?

21
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:53,090
Eiko's said that she'll do it.

22
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:55,690
"Eiko Ikeguchi (23)" -Yes, I said so.

23
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:57,190
That's not the point.

24
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:59,890
Takemi, you're always that way.

25
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:03,390
"Taro Hayashida (28)" -Calm down, Ashizuka.

26
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:05,290
"Tokunori Ashizuka (33)" -No, let me say this.

27
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:09,490
She's always selfish thinking only about herself and causing trouble.

28
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:10,890
True.

29
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:13,191
That's why Motoki died too.

30
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:17,590
Wrong.

31
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:19,091
That was an accident.

32
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:21,890
I wonder about that.

33
00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:23,290
I'll bet you think that what happened three years ago

34
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,790
was my fault too, right?

35
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,490
An accident? Three years ago?

36
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:30,690
Wait, Takemi!

37
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,090
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,491
I did what wasn't called for.

39
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:54,890
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

40
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:57,090
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

41
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:58,590
It was supposed to be a refreshing mountain climbing trip

42
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:01,890
but misfortune strikes an arguing group.

43
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:03,490
He sees through the one and only truth.

44
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,590
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

45
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:07,891
His name is Detective Conan!

46
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,520
"The Dark Mountain Route"

47
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:50,762
It looks like she's going to be sleeping under the cliff tonight.

48
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,463
They look like they don't get along.

49
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:57,262
I'm sure they've got they're reasons.

50
00:03:57,263 --> 00:04:00,562
I'm sorry, all of you.

51
00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:02,962
I'm sorry you had to see that.

52
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:05,963
What kind of accident happened three years ago?

53
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:08,163
What?

54
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:14,062
We all belonged to the same club.

55
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:19,562
But three years ago, one of our members got into an accident.

56
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:23,462
She, Takemi, went off on her own

57
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:28,462
and Motoki went after her and fell off the cliff.

58
00:04:28,463 --> 00:04:31,062
Motoki was my childhood friend

59
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,862
and we used to climb mountains together.

60
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:35,663
We were planning to do so for as long as we could.

61
00:04:36,763 --> 00:04:39,662
But, just because of Takemi!

62
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:40,863
Darn it.

63
00:04:42,263 --> 00:04:45,963
So that's why we gather here to commemorate his death.

64
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,362
What?

65
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:51,762
What's this sound?

66
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:53,962
Maybe it's...

67
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:56,662
"Helium" -It's a meteorological balloon.

68
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,663
Yeah.

69
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:02,362
I'm flying this to the stratosphere to attain weather data.

70
00:05:02,363 --> 00:05:05,662
Mr. Hayashida, you're a meteorological station staff, aren't you?

71
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,962
Right.

72
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:10,862
I'm going to be flying balloons every day for ten days.

73
00:05:10,863 --> 00:05:12,763
I've got all of them here too.

74
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:16,162
Something smells strange.

75
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:20,562
Yeah. I put kerosene on to strengthen it.

76
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:21,662
All done!

77
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:23,462
Amazing!

78
00:05:23,463 --> 00:05:26,162
If we use this to fly through the air,

79
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:29,362
I guess we can reach the peak right away, What?

80
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,362
That's impossible.

81
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:36,262
One balloon can only carry a weight of five to six kg.

82
00:05:36,263 --> 00:05:37,263
There!

83
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:52,163
Genta can really toss and turn.

84
00:05:59,463 --> 00:06:00,862
She's not here.

85
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:02,262
I'll try call her.

86
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:04,362
Let her be, that woman.

87
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,463
But...

88
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:08,562
I'm sorry. Did we wake you?

89
00:06:08,563 --> 00:06:09,762
Nope.

90
00:06:09,763 --> 00:06:13,762
Did Mr. Motoki die at this time?

91
00:06:13,763 --> 00:06:16,762
Hello, Takemi?

92
00:06:16,763 --> 00:06:18,262
Don't wake me up,

93
00:06:18,263 --> 00:06:19,563
I was sleeping.

94
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:22,062
I know!

95
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,463
I'll offer my prayers like I should too!

96
00:06:31,263 --> 00:06:33,362
Where's Mr. Hayashida?

97
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:37,462
He said he was going to a nearby mountain to get data.

98
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,962
What's wrong, Ayumi?

99
00:06:39,963 --> 00:06:42,562
I had a nightmare.

100
00:06:42,563 --> 00:06:45,562
-What? -What?

101
00:06:45,563 --> 00:06:48,463
I see. Poor thing.

102
00:06:49,563 --> 00:06:52,063
I'll cast a spell that will help you go back to sleep.

103
00:06:59,463 --> 00:07:01,162
After we finish eating breakfast,

104
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:03,062
we're heading off right away.

105
00:07:03,063 --> 00:07:04,763
Off to the peak!

106
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:10,462
What's up, Genta?

107
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,363
That...

108
00:07:16,363 --> 00:07:17,963
Takemi is lying on the ground!

109
00:07:19,463 --> 00:07:21,162
Conan!

110
00:07:21,163 --> 00:07:22,562
5:05 am.

111
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:25,163
"Campsite Entrance"

112
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:27,962
Over there!

113
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:29,562
5:45 am.

114
00:07:29,563 --> 00:07:30,663
Takemi!

115
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:35,862
She's dead.

116
00:07:35,863 --> 00:07:37,662
No, it can't be.

117
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:39,563
Look at this.

118
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,062
This is a mountain compass.

119
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:48,163
Yeah.

120
00:07:55,763 --> 00:07:56,962
Takemi?

121
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:59,063
What happened?

122
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:10,062
Could that be a drone?

123
00:08:10,063 --> 00:08:12,362
Yeah. Since we're investigating in the mountains,

124
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:14,262
we've decided to use this.

125
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:15,963
MPD is awesome!

126
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,362
Are you three

127
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:22,562
acquainted to the late Ms. Takemi Yamakura?

128
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:24,662
-Yes. -We found a backpack

129
00:08:24,663 --> 00:08:29,262
in the woods about three km from here.

130
00:08:29,263 --> 00:08:33,262
Will you please confirm if it belongs to Ms. Yamakura?

131
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,162
Backpack in the woods?

132
00:08:36,163 --> 00:08:39,162
No mistake about it. It's Takemi's.

133
00:08:39,163 --> 00:08:40,662
I see.

134
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:42,462
There was a knife,

135
00:08:42,463 --> 00:08:45,262
that is thought to be a murder weapon and an empty wallet inside.

136
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:47,762
The perp disposed of it, right?

137
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:51,162
Then the perp after killing Takemi below,

138
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,862
fled out of the mountains.

139
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:55,262
No, the thing is...

140
00:08:55,263 --> 00:08:57,062
The mountain security guards

141
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:59,762
were at the mountain hut by the entrance

142
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:01,662
at the foot of the mountain from 4 am,

143
00:09:01,663 --> 00:09:03,462
but they said they saw no one who looked to be the perp

144
00:09:03,463 --> 00:09:05,862
leave the mountains.

145
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:08,062
Just what does that mean?

146
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:11,262
It could be that someone left the backpack in the woods

147
00:09:11,263 --> 00:09:14,562
to make it look as if someone from the outside committed the crime.

148
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:19,062
In other words, you're saying that one of us did it.

149
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:21,962
Wait. It's impossible.

150
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:23,962
What makes you say that?

151
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,662
Takemi was alive till 3 am.

152
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:28,262
You were there too, weren't you?

153
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:29,263
Yep.

154
00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:33,162
It's the time that Ms. Eiko made a call on the phone, right?

155
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:34,462
Right.

156
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,862
We found the body about 5 am.

157
00:09:37,863 --> 00:09:38,962
In other words,

158
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:41,962
the crime was committed within a span of two hours.

159
00:09:41,963 --> 00:09:43,962
But no matter how fast you are,

160
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:46,062
in order to get to the crime scene using the mountain trail,

161
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:48,862
it'll at least take 40 to 50 minutes.

162
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:52,762
It took us about that long when we went there earlier.

163
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:55,762
Then if the perp killed Ms. Takemi

164
00:09:55,763 --> 00:10:00,162
and left the backpack in the woods three km away,

165
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:02,962
it would take her an additional 30 to 40 minutes.

166
00:10:02,963 --> 00:10:05,262
Since the mountain trail heading back is uphill,

167
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:07,662
maybe it took more than 60 minutes.

168
00:10:07,663 --> 00:10:10,562
That would amount to a total of more than 120 minutes.

169
00:10:10,563 --> 00:10:12,562
Doing so within two hours is impossible.

170
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:14,862
Besides that, Mr. Ashizuka and the others

171
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:17,262
were sleeping with us in the mountain hut.

172
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:19,962
Ms. Eiko was sleeping with me too!

173
00:10:19,963 --> 00:10:22,562
See. Eiko and I couldn't have done it.

174
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:25,062
But, as for you, Hayashida.

175
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:28,162
I was in the mountains on the other side doing my observation.

176
00:10:28,163 --> 00:10:29,762
I see.

177
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:35,563
Will you tell us a little about the late Ms. Yamakura then?

178
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:40,662
I wonder if they really didn't do it?

179
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:42,462
Ms. Eiko, didn't.

180
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:44,162
I'm sure.

181
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:48,362
But, we saw those four people fighting, didn't we?

182
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:50,762
Okay, shall we start investigations, then?

183
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:51,862
What?

184
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:53,862
-Yes! -Yes!

185
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:56,662
If someone among them is the perp,

186
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:58,162
it would mean that the perp left the mountain hut,

187
00:10:58,163 --> 00:10:59,762
went to the scene of the crime and the woods,

188
00:10:59,763 --> 00:11:03,962
then returned within a span of two hours.

189
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,162
However, this is actually impossible.

190
00:11:06,163 --> 00:11:09,062
If so, what if the perp climbed?

191
00:11:09,063 --> 00:11:10,462
-Climbed? -Climbed?

192
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,762
Yes, if you were to climb straight up and down that cliff

193
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:15,262
without taking the mountain trail,

194
00:11:15,263 --> 00:11:16,562
it could be done in two hours.

195
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:19,762
Ms. Eiko was climbing, but...

196
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,762
No, but that cliff is about 50 m.

197
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:27,262
It would take even an expert climber at least an hour.

198
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:28,862
No good.

199
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:30,362
Then, it's the river!

200
00:11:30,363 --> 00:11:31,363
-River? -River?

201
00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:34,462
Yep. Mr. Ashizuka were kayaking, right?

202
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:36,962
If he used the river that is near this open square

203
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,562
and go downstream on the currents.

204
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:42,762
True, it zigzags all the way to the scene.

205
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:45,962
It may be okay going there but what about coming back?

206
00:11:45,963 --> 00:11:48,262
You can't reverse upstream

207
00:11:48,263 --> 00:11:51,762
and you would need time to put the canoe away.

208
00:11:51,763 --> 00:11:53,662
No good.

209
00:11:53,663 --> 00:11:55,162
I got it!

210
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:56,862
The sky...

211
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:58,062
The hot air balloon.

212
00:11:58,063 --> 00:11:59,362
-Hot air balloon? -Hot air balloon?

213
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:00,862
Yeah. The perp flew like a bird

214
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:03,962
and went to the scene of the crime as well as the woods.

215
00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:06,962
The wind is blowing from the south to the north

216
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:08,862
so a balloon could make the flight.

217
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:12,662
One hot air balloon can carry a maximum of up to five to six kg,

218
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:14,762
so it's impossible for humans to ride it.

219
00:12:14,763 --> 00:12:18,562
That's why all the balloons were inflated and set out.

220
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:20,162
How about it, Conan?

221
00:12:20,163 --> 00:12:23,862
Mr. Hayashida said that he had balloons to last ten days, right?

222
00:12:23,863 --> 00:12:25,662
Now, he has nine balloons left.

223
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:27,762
In other words, even if he were to use all his balloons,

224
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:30,062
I think it'd be difficult.

225
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:31,962
-No good. -No good.

226
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:34,162
This is a difficult problem.

227
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:36,763
I can't think of anything.

228
00:12:37,863 --> 00:12:39,063
It's out of place.

229
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:42,763
"Helium"

230
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:46,463
Mud?

231
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,963
Over here.

232
00:12:55,863 --> 00:12:57,363
The traces of a rope?

233
00:12:58,463 --> 00:12:59,763
Conan.

234
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:02,162
What's the matter?

235
00:13:02,163 --> 00:13:04,662
What?

236
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:06,162
What's this?

237
00:13:06,163 --> 00:13:07,962
Wait, Edogawa.

238
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:09,462
That's wool.

239
00:13:09,463 --> 00:13:10,862
Hey!

240
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:13,763
There's some commotion at the mountain hut!

241
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:22,530
Is this a balloon?

242
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:25,330
Yes. The drone found it a little into the woods

243
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:28,830
where the backpack was found on the ground.

244
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:31,530
It seems to have gotten stuck on the branch of a tree and tore.

245
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:33,130
A balloon.

246
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:34,330
I see.

247
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:36,530
So, you're the perp after all.

248
00:13:36,531 --> 00:13:38,630
Me, the perp?

249
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:42,530
Right. You used this to transport the backpack, didn't you?

250
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:44,530
Transport the backpack with the balloon?

251
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:48,330
At 3 am, you said that you were going on an observation,

252
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:51,830
took one balloon and went below the cliff.

253
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,930
And then you killed Takemi.

254
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:57,230
Then you tied the backpack onto the balloon

255
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:59,030
and flew off to the sky and transported it to the woods.

256
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:01,830
This way, you can do it within two hours.

257
00:14:01,831 --> 00:14:05,330
It was unlucky that it got stuck part way to a tree.

258
00:14:05,331 --> 00:14:06,830
Wait.

259
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:09,130
I was on observation then.

260
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:10,830
"Observation Notes" -I also have the observations notes.

261
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:13,930
It's easy to fake one of those any day.

262
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:16,730
Besides the red compass that was found at the site.

263
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:20,531
Isn't that what Motoki gave you as a keepsake?

264
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:23,730
You saw it at the site too, didn't you?

265
00:14:23,731 --> 00:14:25,131
Why didn't you say anything about it?

266
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:28,330
I didn't want to be suspected.

267
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:29,430
Liar!

268
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:31,630
You just pretended you didn't know, right?

269
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:34,230
You're the perp after all!

270
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:35,830
Inspector!

271
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:38,730
We found this in Mr. Hayashida's belongings.

272
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:40,130
What's this?

273
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:42,530
It's an observation device that is attached to the balloon.

274
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:45,730
But, I usually carry it around with me.

275
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:47,830
There's blood on it.

276
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:50,430
I could be the victim's.

277
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,630
No, I didn't do it!

278
00:14:52,631 --> 00:14:55,530
So he was the perp after all.

279
00:14:55,531 --> 00:14:59,130
Balloons... Kerosene... Wool...

280
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,131
Something's bothering you, right?

281
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:11,631
Maybe...

282
00:15:12,731 --> 00:15:13,931
Officer Takagi!

283
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,131
Stop in right there.

284
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:19,431
I thought so.

285
00:15:21,131 --> 00:15:23,530
So that's the story.

286
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:26,230
No, I didn't do it.

287
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:27,630
It's not me.

288
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:30,330
Please wait, Inspector.

289
00:15:30,331 --> 00:15:32,130
Hey, Shinichi.

290
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,330
Is something wrong, Dr. Agasa?

291
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:37,930
No. I just have several things that are bothering me.

292
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:39,230
Mr. Hayashida,

293
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:42,730
you wiped you hands and body very clean yesterday, didn't you?

294
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:46,030
What? Yes, I did.

295
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:49,630
That's why you don't smell of kerosene.

296
00:15:49,631 --> 00:15:50,830
Kerosene?

297
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:54,930
Yes. You use it to reinforce the strengthen of rubber balloons.

298
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:58,230
If he used the balloon, the smell would still be there.

299
00:15:58,231 --> 00:16:01,130
It could be that he wiped it off right after committing the crime.

300
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:04,130
Even if Mr. Hayashida were to be the perp,

301
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,930
he only had two hours at the most.

302
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,430
Did he really have that much time?

303
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:12,030
So, are you saying that the perp is someone else?

304
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,130
That is what it would mean.

305
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:17,431
There is something I would like you all to see.

306
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:20,230
It's this.

307
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:24,231
The board here could easily be removed.

308
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:26,630
One more thing.

309
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:27,830
Officer Takagi.

310
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:32,330
Will you please confirm how many balloons there are in that shed?

311
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:33,431
Yes, sir.

312
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:36,930
There are three left.

313
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:42,030
Mr. Hayashida, how many balloons are really supposed to be left?

314
00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:43,330
Nine.

315
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:45,530
There are six missing after all.

316
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:48,630
The real perp used the balloons.

317
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:52,030
-What? -Dr. Agasa, what do you mean?

318
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:56,730
The perp before 3 am after everyone hit the sack,

319
00:16:56,731 --> 00:17:01,330
left the mountain hut and got the six balloons ready.

320
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:05,030
But, when you inflate them, the sound is pretty loud.

321
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:09,230
So there was a need to go some distance away from the mountain hut.

322
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:12,130
There were the traces that were left behind back then.

323
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:16,130
Then after 3 am, after everyone offered prayer to Mr. Motoki,

324
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:18,230
and went back to bed,

325
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:20,830
the perp left the mountain hut,

326
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,130
took the six balloons that had been prepared beforehand

327
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:28,030
and jumped off the edge of the cliff.

328
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:29,430
Jumped off?

329
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:31,730
So, the perp flew through the sky after all.

330
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:32,731
Impossible.

331
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:36,230
People can't float using just six balloons.

332
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:37,530
True,

333
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:41,630
but that indeed is the key of this trick.

334
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,330
People can't float

335
00:17:43,331 --> 00:17:46,430
but you can limit the descending speed.

336
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:50,730
Like a bird that spreads its wings wide and decreases speed.

337
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:54,630
It lands once on a rock part way and slows down

338
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:57,030
and then the perp jumped below again.

339
00:17:57,031 --> 00:17:59,831
In this way, the perp got there in the shortest amount of time.

340
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:03,730
You could never do something

341
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:05,430
so ridiculous.

342
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:07,430
Take a look at this.

343
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:10,130
It's a picture of a rock part way through the cliff.

344
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,931
There's an odd footprint where the tip of the toes are faced downwards.

345
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:16,430
Please wait.

346
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:17,730
If there were only six balloons,

347
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:20,930
the person would've had to be very light.

348
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:22,230
Right!

349
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:26,630
The real perp is you! Ms. Eiko Ikeguchi.

350
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:28,330
Me, the perp?

351
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:29,431
Wrong.

352
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:33,430
It's not her!

353
00:18:33,431 --> 00:18:34,730
No.

354
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:37,930
After you reached the bottom of the cliff,

355
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:40,830
out of the six balloons, you let go of five.

356
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:42,630
The balloons were blown by the wind

357
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:45,330
and flew to the lake to the north

358
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:47,130
and would not be found by anyone.

359
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:49,630
As to the one that remained you released the gas,

360
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:52,730
scratched it and kept it.

361
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,730
After you killed Ms. Takemi,

362
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:57,130
you put Mr. Motoki's compass down

363
00:18:57,131 --> 00:19:01,730
and headed north with Ms. Takemi's backpack and wallet.

364
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:04,430
After arriving at the woods three km ahead,

365
00:19:04,431 --> 00:19:05,730
you put the backpack down

366
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:09,630
and left the balloon that you had deflated there.

367
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:11,430
Then you returned and

368
00:19:11,431 --> 00:19:13,130
put the observation device

369
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:18,130
with Ms. Takemi's blood on it inside the backpack.

370
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:19,930
Wrong.

371
00:19:19,931 --> 00:19:22,630
Wrong, I didn't do it!

372
00:19:22,631 --> 00:19:25,630
You smell like kerosene, Miss.

373
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,030
What?

374
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:28,930
Come to think of it now,

375
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:33,130
all your actions had meaning to it, right?

376
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,131
Meaning?

377
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,530
Yep.

378
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:37,330
That argument too.

379
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:40,030
And calling Ms. Takemi's cell phone.

380
00:19:40,031 --> 00:19:42,630
It was all to make her go

381
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:45,630
under the cliff and make it apparent that

382
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:48,630
she was definitely alive till 3 am

383
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:50,530
Don't be ridiculous.

384
00:19:50,531 --> 00:19:53,630
I was sleeping together with Ayumi when the incident took place.

385
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:57,030
That was one of you calculated moves too.

386
00:19:57,031 --> 00:20:01,530
You wanted Yoshida to testify your alibi for you.

387
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:02,830
Is it true?

388
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:04,030
No.

389
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:05,330
Enough already.

390
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:08,530
I didn't do it, and neither did I go to the woods!

391
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:10,331
I found this.

392
00:20:11,531 --> 00:20:13,430
It's a species of thistle.

393
00:20:13,431 --> 00:20:15,430
In this place, you can only find them growing colonies

394
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:17,230
in the area around the woods.

395
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:19,430
It was on Yoshida's pants.

396
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:22,231
It probably got there because she slept with you.

397
00:20:24,731 --> 00:20:28,930
See, so you did go to the woods after all.

398
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:32,730
After going to the woods you came back right down here.

399
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,530
All you had left to do was to return home.

400
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:39,130
However, if you use the mountain trail, you may leave proof behind.

401
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:42,530
That's why you climbed this cliff on your way back here.

402
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:44,830
But since you were in such a rush,

403
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:47,330
you goofed at the very end.

404
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,030
This is blood.

405
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:50,031
Hey!

406
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:51,031
Yes, sir.

407
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:52,431
Excuse me.

408
00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:57,231
This is the trace of the rope of the balloon.

409
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:01,730
Eiko, why did you...

410
00:21:01,731 --> 00:21:05,930
I was secretly dating with Motoki.

411
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,630
I couldn't forgive Takemi who made him get into an accident.

412
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:14,930
You spent three years planning the murder

413
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:17,230
and studied about balloons just for that.

414
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:21,330
But why frame Hayashida for committing the crime?

415
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:25,430
Hayashida you knew about us, didn't you?

416
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:28,330
And you were jealous all the while.

417
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:32,630
So, even if you knew that Motoki was headed towards a dangerous wall,

418
00:21:32,631 --> 00:21:34,431
you didn't say anything.

419
00:23:10,231 --> 00:23:11,330
"Mount Kumomaru, Peak" -Okay!

420
00:23:11,331 --> 00:23:13,530
Let's take a picture in memory of this trip!

421
00:23:13,531 --> 00:23:15,030
Are you all in line everybody?

422
00:23:15,031 --> 00:23:17,330
-Yeah. -Mitsuhiko, thanks.

423
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:21,130
Why? I wanna be in the picture with Haibara too.

424
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:22,630
I'm sorry, Ayumi.

425
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:24,030
I want to be in the picture too!

426
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:25,930
Thanks, Conan!

427
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:27,330
Who, me?

428
00:23:27,331 --> 00:23:28,931
I guess I have no choice!

429
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:32,430
Officer Takagi!

430
00:23:32,431 --> 00:23:35,231
Everybody, this is a special reward for all of you.

431
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:38,531
Here goes. Cheese.

432
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:45,731
"Next Episode" -Walking alone on the streets at night is dangerous.

433
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:51,030
Pops.

434
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:55,830
There's a weird smell mixed in with the smell of alcohol.

435
00:23:55,831 --> 00:23:57,530
He smells kind of like peppers.

436
00:23:57,531 --> 00:24:01,030
This wall sure is shiny like a mirror.

437
00:24:01,031 --> 00:24:05,231
That's because it's UV coated.

438
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:12,631
Next Conan, "Security System Pitfall"
