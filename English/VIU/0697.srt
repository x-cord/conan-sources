Please! Re-investigate my older sister's suicide case!

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,231
Well, well, please take it easy.

4
00:00:08,231 --> 00:00:10,131
First of all, please give me your name.

5
00:00:10,131 --> 00:00:11,831
Oh, yes.

"Misaki Yanai (17)" -I am Misaki Yanai.

7
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:17,231
I was going to the same school as Sonoko

8
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:19,231
and Ran until intermediate school.

9
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:21,531
And, from high school

10
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:23,231
she went to Seimi Yanai Academy

11
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,531
where her mother is chairman.

12
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:28,931
I see. To Seimi Yanai Academy?

13
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:31,831
And? You have doubts about your older sister's suicide?

14
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,231
Yes! Nagisa...

15
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:37,331
My older sister would never commit suicide!

16
00:00:37,331 --> 00:00:39,631
But, the if the police concluded it as suicide,

17
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:42,531
they would've had to come up with evidence to prove it.

18
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:44,731
There were two eye-witnesses.

19
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:48,131
I see. Eye-witnesses.

20
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,931
One of them is me.

21
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:52,531
I see...

22
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:56,431
But, that's a mistake!

23
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,731
Well...

24
00:00:57,731 --> 00:00:59,231
Please!

25
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:02,231
Please prove that my older sister didn't commit suicide!

"Girls' Academy's Window"

35
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,739
Yeah. Forensics were sure too.

36
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:15,539
They declared that Ms. Nagisa Yanai unmistakably committed suicide.

37
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:16,939
Just as I thought, after all.

38
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:19,439
Thank you very much, Inspector.

39
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:23,939
So, Inspector Megure told me.

40
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:26,039
I know!

41
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,039
That's why I came to see you Detective Mouri.

Hey. Help me.

45
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,339
Hey, Pops.

46
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:39,039
Why don't you at least ask her what she witnessed?

47
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,839
I guess so.

48
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:45,539
At any rate, calm down. Tell him exactly what you saw.

49
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:47,339
Yep. I'll do that.

50
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:49,539
I'm just going to hear you out, okay, Miss.

51
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:52,639
At sundown 5 days ago.

52
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,039
Just around 18:00.

54
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,239
and told that she wanted to talk to me.

55
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,939
Ms. Kodama?

56
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:04,339
Yes, she's my advisor for both my high school

57
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:07,339
and university drama club.

58
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:10,339
My older sister and I both belong to the drama club.

59
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:14,639
My older sister was scheduled to play the main actress

60
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,839

62

early next year, I'm still not decided on the program.

63
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:27,539
To put it simply, it's whether it should be a comedy or tragedy.

64
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:29,739
Yes, I heard about it from my sister.

65
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:32,639
That if it's for foundation day, it should have a happy ending

66
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,839
or you have to touch the hearts of people

67
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,139
and bring it to a climax with acting skills.

68
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:38,339
Nagisa is also undecided.

69
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,439
That's why I wanted to hear what you have to say too.

70
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,039
But, she sure is late.

71
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:46,939
Nagisa told me to wait here.

72
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:48,739
What?

73
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:51,739
That's the model art crafts club, isn't it?

74
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:53,939
I'm sure all the club members have left though.

75
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:56,939
Maybe it's the advisor, Mr. Shibagaki?

76
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:01,539
He's supposed be having a meeting with the chairman from 17:30.

77
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:09,339
Sis?

78
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:12,039
Ms. Yanai? Why is she...

79
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:14,439
What's she trying to do?

80
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,639

hook the rope up?

83
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,239
The beams in that room are all plain to see.

84
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,139
Sis! Sis!

85
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,739
No good, it's sound proof!

86
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:32,339
No!

87
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,839
It's locked!

88

89
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:44,939

Yes!

91
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:49,139
Was the chairman's room nearby?

92
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,339
Yes. It was way faster than for us to go around

93
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:55,239
to the front gate. Besides, it's on the same 2nd floor.

94
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:57,739
So, your mother was there.

95
00:05:57,739 --> 00:06:00,739
And the teacher called Shibagaki, too.

96
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:05,539
Hello.

97
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,339
What is it about?

98
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:10,539
Sis is in trouble!

99
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:13,939
The model art crafts club. Hurry! Come quick!

100
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,339
Nagisa! Nagisa!

101
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:30,339
Why did you do something like this?

102
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:34,039
That teacher called Shibagaki, was he your sister's boyfriend?

103
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,039
He's the chairman in charge of finances at the academy

104
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,639
and they were planning to get married after her sister's graduation.

105
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,939
"Touichirou Shibagaki (26)" -How can you leave without me?

106
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,139
It's ridiculous, I can't believe it!

107
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,539
Hey, Misaki.

108
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,039
Why did you think that it wasn't what it seemed like

109
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,239
despite having witnessed the scene?

110
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,539
I guess you have a reason for it, wasn't it?

111
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,239
Your sister had a lover that she was going to get married to, too.

112
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:03,639
So wasn't she having the best time of her life?

113
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,239
True. I wonder if she's commit suicide at a time like that.

114
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:10,939
The problem was with that lover of hers, though.

115
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:12,439
What do you mean?

116
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,939
Mr. Shibagaki attended the same university as Ms. Kodama.

117
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:19,439
They used to be in love with each other previously.

118
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,839
She's the teacher that witnessed the scene with you, right?

119
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,439
Huh? Then maybe he was two-timing?

120
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,639
-Yes. -Did they admit to their relationship?

121
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,939
The investigation of the police revealed it so,

122
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:32,339
Mr. Shibazaki did though unwillingly.

123
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:35,339
And, what's Ms. Kodama saying about it?

124
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:37,039
What's with this boy?

125
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,739
He's a precocious brat. Don't let him bother you.

126
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:42,839
But, he can be sharp at times.

127
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,639
Only at times?

128
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,739
And, what did Ms. Kodama say?

129
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:50,639
She did admit that they used to be lovers before.

130
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,739
But, she says they parted once and for all already.

131
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,339
I wonder.

132
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:58,239
To think that the two are working at the same school.

133
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:02,539
So, Nagisa, who troubled over this, committed suicide. Maybe.

134
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:06,939
No, she would never commit suicide without saying anything.

135
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:10,539
She would've slammed the wedding ring back at the betrayer.

136
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:13,139
She would've done that at least, my sister.

137
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,739
But...

138
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:16,339
Is something bothering you?

139
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:18,239
You found out about that scandal

140
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:20,739
only after the police investigated it, didn't you?

141
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:23,239
How did your sister find out about it?

142
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,039
Yeah, that's true.

143
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,439
That's true.

144
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:31,339
That's right. Besides I got this from big sis.

145
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:34,339
See, it's carved Nagisa.

146
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:38,439
She asked me to go get the size adjusted at the shop she bought it from.

147
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:41,139
-When was this? -The day she committed suicide.

148
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,939
In other words, Nagisa still didn't know about Shibagaki and his ex-lover.

149
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:48,439
Not only that,

150
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:49,739
she said that she wanted to keep the bracelet on

151
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:51,839
even after she got married.

152
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,539
You sister was full of happiness, wasn't she?

153
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:59,039
That's why I can't believe that she committed suicide!

154
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,239
But you saw with your very eyes

155
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:05,239
that your sister committed suicide.

156
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:07,239
No!

157
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:12,839
The rope that was used

158
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,939
was what the model art crafts club had prepared for packing.

159
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:18,539
The stool that she used for a step ladder

160
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:22,139
was knocked over in the corner of the room by the partition screen.

161
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:25,039
Since there were casters on the stool

162
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,439
it probably rolled some distance after it was kicked.

163
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:31,439
But, this is really something.

164
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:33,939
Is this the model of Seimi Yanai Academy?

165
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:35,939
Did the students make all these?

166
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:40,039
We all made it together, but the advisor probably also helped.

167
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,239
Oh, you mean Mr. Shibagaki?

168
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:46,739
Yes. He's a model making freak and a war maniac.

169
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:48,639
So, he donated his own collection for exhibition, too.

170
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,839
I think he donated a lot of it, too.

171
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,539
Wow!

172
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:55,339
This is the radio controlled model of war tank Elefant (Elephant)

173
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:57,439
that was developed in Germany in World War II.

174
00:09:57,439 --> 00:09:59,639
You're really knowledgeable.

175
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,639
Sort of.

176
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,839
You're a boy after all.

177
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,139
As a girl, this is more like it.

178
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,139
Mr. Mouri, hello.

179
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:14,339
Takagi, is it all right to bring that picture along with you?

180
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,239
Don't blame me if the Inspector gets on you.

181
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:19,239
Well, since we found that this was not a homicide case.

182
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:23,239
But these kids are saying that it's not suicide.

183
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:25,339
Oh, I see.

184
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:27,139
What do you mean, "I see"?

185
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:28,139
Listen.

186
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:29,939
What's suspicious in cases like these

187
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:33,239
is that somebody gains from the death of the victim!

188
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:35,339
But, in this case,

189
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,039
almost everybody lost out instead of make gains.

190
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,339
Ms. Kodama and Mr. Shibagaki were suspected of scandal,

191
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,039
while Chairman Yanai, because of shock from losing her daughter,

192
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,539
is saying that she wants to close down Seimi Academy.

193
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:49,739
Let's say, even if there were to be a culprit, no one made out.

194
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:51,739
There would be no reason to cause the incident.

195
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:53,039
Alright.

196
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,139
What is it, Conan?

197
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,539
Did you find anything that bothers you?

198
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:01,639
The pictures aren't enough,

199
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,039
so let's go to the site!

200
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,839
-To the site? -Yep.

201
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,039
Then we may be able to find something, right?

202
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,539
It's okay to go, isn't it, Officer Takagi?

203
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,039
Yeah. It's not really closed off or anything

204
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,439
so it should be okay.

205
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,939
I'm not going.

206
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,941
Okay, we'll report to you later then, Pops.

207
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,685
It's about time.

208
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,710
Oh, there she is.

209
00:11:40,112 --> 00:11:42,012
Wait.

210
00:11:42,012 --> 00:11:45,312
Back then, all of Sis' face was in clear view.

211
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:47,212
Okay, I'll go tell her that then.

212
00:11:47,212 --> 00:11:48,712
I'll call you on the cell phone.

213
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:50,212
Okay.

214
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:56,312
Back then, the front entrance was locked, right?

215
00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:57,512
Yeah.

216
00:11:59,912 --> 00:12:01,612
Will going back this much do?

217
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:04,912
Yep, right. Try getting on.

218
00:12:08,212 --> 00:12:10,812
How about this time?

219
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:12,412
That's just the place!

220
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:13,712
Okay.

221
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:29,412
Is this the trace of a crawler?

222
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:32,512
It must've crashed pretty badly.

223
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:38,512
Hey.

224
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:41,212
Can we finish replaying the scene?

225
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:42,212
Oh, yep.

226
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:43,312
Then...

227
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:53,512
Are you okay?

228
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:56,212
If you think so, hurry and get off of me!

229
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:57,712
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:01,212
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

231
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:02,912
Oh, Misaki?

232
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:07,612
As to that case. As we mentioned the other day, our office...

233
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:10,012
Yes, I know.

234
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:14,312
But... Unless you come and actually talk to me at the site.

235
00:13:14,312 --> 00:13:17,212
My mother and I cannot be convinced.

236
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:19,512
But, even so...

237
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:23,112
Please, just explaining will do.

238
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:26,612
All right.

239
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:28,012
Thank you very much!

240
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:30,712
But, mind you, I'm just going over to explain.

241
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:33,212
Yes, sir! I'm looking forward to seeing you!

242
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,312
See you later, then.

243
00:13:36,512 --> 00:13:38,112
Well, in other words, I'm doing it

244
00:13:38,112 --> 00:13:41,812
just to convince that girl and make her give up what she's doing.

245
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:44,612
This is also one of the duties of a great detective!

246
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:48,212
What on earth is Mr. Mouri thinking of starting?

247
00:13:48,212 --> 00:13:49,612
Haven't you heard anything?

248
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:54,012
No. He just said, you'll know if you come.

249
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:56,612
We're busy getting ready to close down the school now

250
00:13:56,612 --> 00:13:58,712
and can't spare much time.

251
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,212
Well, sorry to keep you waiting.

252
00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:06,012
What brings you here, Inspector?

253
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:12,712
Dad?

254
00:14:14,212 --> 00:14:17,712
He's already gotten into the Sleeping Kogoro mode!

255
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:20,712
Thank you for waiting, everyone.

256
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:24,112
I am here of request from Ms. Misaki Yanai.

257
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:26,812
That's already been solved!

258
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:29,712
Of course I know that.

259
00:14:29,712 --> 00:14:32,512
It's true that the victim was thought to have committed suicide.

260
00:14:32,512 --> 00:14:34,612
But, she committed suicide on the very day

261
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:36,512
that she asked her younger sister to go

262
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:39,112
and adjust her bracelet for her.

263
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:42,012
Isn't this a bit unnatural?

264
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:45,612
As to that, I'm to blame for it.

265
00:14:45,612 --> 00:14:49,512
Nagisa who found out that I betrayed her, probably impulsively...

266
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:55,512
Then when and how did Nagisa find out about it?

267
00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:58,512
Well. Now that Nagisa is no longer here...

268
00:14:58,512 --> 00:15:02,012
There is no way of knowing. I see.

269
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:04,912
By the way, I hear that Misaki, Ran and the others,

270
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:07,712
replayed the scene of the incident to re-confirm things.

271
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:12,112
Sonoko, could you replay the scene for us again here now?

272
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,712
You want us to do it again?

273
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:16,712
I'm sorry, but Mrs. Yanai,

274
00:15:16,712 --> 00:15:19,612
please bear with us for a while longer.

275
00:15:19,612 --> 00:15:23,412
Sonoko, at first, put the step ladder in that position,

276
00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:27,712
but it didn't match the position that Nagisa was witnessed from.

277
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:29,012
In order to match the position,

278
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:32,112
there was a need to pull more away from the window.

279
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:34,612
Uh... About here.

280
00:15:35,612 --> 00:15:37,412
What about it?

281
00:15:37,412 --> 00:15:39,412
That's not the point.

282
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:42,412
She couldn't have committed suicide there.

283
00:15:42,412 --> 00:15:45,612
Because at the time of the incident on that day...

284
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:50,212
the model of Seimi Academy was placed there.

285
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:55,012
Just to be sure, I'd like to ask you, Misaki.

286
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:58,212
How much of the room space did the model crafts take up?

287
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:01,512
Oh, yes. Up to this line.

288
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:05,812
As you can see, it's not possible to put the step ladder there.

289
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:09,212
But if you avoid the model crafts and place the step ladder in position,

290
00:16:09,212 --> 00:16:11,912
it doesn't match the testimonies of the eye-witnesses.

291
00:16:11,912 --> 00:16:16,012
In order to make it come out the same by going near the window,

292
00:16:16,012 --> 00:16:18,712
a step ladder that is much lower was needed.

293
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:20,712
Hey, hey. The only thing

294
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:22,612
that could serve as a step ladder that was around was the stool.

295
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:25,412
Well, in fact there was something else.

296
00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:27,112
Uh, Inspector.

297
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:30,412
Why are you so stuck on the position she committed suicide?

298
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:33,112
It's almost like you're trying to determine where to stand on stage.

299
00:16:33,112 --> 00:16:34,712
Come to think of it,

300
00:16:34,712 --> 00:16:37,612
back then, sis' face up to her hips were in view

301
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:40,012
as if she had used a measure or something.

302
00:16:40,012 --> 00:16:42,112
I wonder if that was just a coincidence?

303
00:16:42,112 --> 00:16:44,612
If that was not a coincidence then...

304
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:49,712
If someone had told her what to do...

305
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:53,512
To make sure that the two in the yard could get a good view of her.

306
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,512
You mean Sis committed suicide

307
00:16:55,512 --> 00:16:58,112
making sure that we saw what she did?

308
00:16:58,112 --> 00:17:01,812
That's right, Nagisa wanted Ms. Kodama

309
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,412
to watch her suicidal act.

310
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:07,712
Therefore, she chose the best position to do this.

311
00:17:07,712 --> 00:17:12,012
Oh, so that's why she told me to wait at the bench in the courtyard.

312
00:17:12,012 --> 00:17:15,212
So, that suicide was an act that Sis' put on?

313
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:17,312
This is what Nagisa thought.

314
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:19,212
She wanted the audience that came to see her

315
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:21,712
at the Foundation Festival, to watch her act.

316
00:17:21,712 --> 00:17:23,712
For that, she thought she had to

317
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:25,812
overwhelm Ms. Kodama with her performance.

318
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:26,912
If she succeeds,

319
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,312
even if it were to have a tragic ending,

320
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:31,812
everyone who watches it would take to it.

321
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:33,412
I understand...

322
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:36,712
I'm sure Nagisa would've carried such a performance.

323
00:17:36,712 --> 00:17:38,912
So, in this way,

324
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:42,212
he lead the victim on with his skillful talk.

325
00:17:42,212 --> 00:17:44,312
The only one who could've done that is...

326
00:17:45,912 --> 00:17:47,712
Hey. Just what're you talking about?

327
00:17:47,712 --> 00:17:49,212
Nothing out of the ordinary.

328
00:17:49,212 --> 00:17:53,112
I never mentioned your name whatsoever yet.

329
00:17:54,212 --> 00:17:57,712
There are several rows of benches in the courtyard,

330
00:17:57,712 --> 00:17:59,112
but for some reason all the benches other than the ones

331
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,912
that Misaki and Ms. Kodama sat on

332
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:03,812
had a "wet paint" sign on them.

333
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:06,112
I heard from an employee

334
00:18:06,112 --> 00:18:11,112
that Mr. Shibagaki had asked to have them painted on that very day.

335
00:18:11,112 --> 00:18:13,612
This way, the special seat to watch her performance from

336
00:18:13,612 --> 00:18:16,612
was automatically set.

337
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:19,912
Moreover, for some reason only on that day,

338
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:22,712
the side entrance door was locked.

339
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,712
And, who took care of the keys?

340
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:30,212
It's you, wasn't it, Mr. Shibagaki?

341
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:32,812
But, Mr. Mouri,

342
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,512
let's say her suicide was in fact an act,

343
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:37,912
why did it turne out to be real?

344
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:41,312
That's because the step ladder moved on its own.

345
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:42,312
What?

346
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:45,312
The stool would've been too high to use as a step ladder,

347
00:18:45,312 --> 00:18:49,112
therefore, the culprit told her to get on the war tank.

348
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:50,412
A war tank?

349
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:53,812
The Elefant war tank that was at the site?

350
00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:57,812
Officer Takagi, would you please bring it over here?

351
00:18:57,812 --> 00:19:02,412
It's from Germany and made from aluminum die-casting.

352
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:06,412
It is totally capable of supporting the weight of a woman.

353
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:11,012
Which means that she used this war tank as a step ladder?

354
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,412
6:00 in the evening, was probably the time

355
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:46,712
that the victim was told to start the performance.

356
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:49,812
If the remote controller is used exactly at that time,

357
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:53,412
there's no need to be in this room to move the war tank.

358
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:55,512
Mr. Shibagaki, you were keying in

359
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:58,612
the calculator back then with your left hand, weren't you?

360
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:01,212
You had your right hand in your pocket.

361
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:02,912
What if you had the remote controller

362
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:06,012
in your pocket at that time?

363
00:20:06,012 --> 00:20:07,312
I've been framed!

364
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:09,612
I got a call from Misaki

365
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:11,712
and was shocked to hear about Nagisa having committed suicide.

366
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,412
I'm a victim too, you know.

367
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,812
That's a lie! All I could say was rush over to the model art crafts club

368
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:17,912
and yet...

369
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,112
Sis' in trouble!

370
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:23,512
In the model art crafts room. Hurry! Quick!

371
00:20:23,512 --> 00:20:26,212
And yet, how did you know it was suicide?

372
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:28,912
That was just a slip of the tongue.

373
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:32,912
When you got to the site, was the step ladder there?

374
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:35,412
I saw it through the curtains by the partition screen,

375
00:20:35,412 --> 00:20:37,812
-if you're talking about the stool. -I see.

376
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:40,512
In other words, you confirmed the step ladder

377
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:43,312
while you went in to save her.

378
00:20:43,312 --> 00:20:46,212
This is ridiculous! When I made my donation,

379
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:49,012
I removed all the power source from all the models.

380
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:50,912
I didn't want the students

381
00:20:50,912 --> 00:20:54,212
to tamper with my precious models, you see.

382
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,912
It's true that there seems to be no antennas in sight.

383
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:58,612
Of course not.

384
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:00,212
Thanks for your deduction,

385
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:02,312
but what doesn't move, doesn't move!

386
00:21:05,812 --> 00:21:07,612
It moved!

387
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:11,012
I had Conan check on it beforehand.

388
00:21:11,012 --> 00:21:14,212
The antennas were modified to built-in types.

389
00:21:14,212 --> 00:21:17,612
There are traces that the motors have been removed once,

390
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:21,412
but now they seem to have been put back on again.

391
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:25,012
Could you answer what all this means?

392
00:21:33,412 --> 00:21:38,412
It seems that Mr. Shibagaki has finished retorting.

393
00:23:03,712 --> 00:23:08,112
Ms. Kodama seems to have confessed to the chairman.

394
00:23:08,112 --> 00:23:11,512
Mr. Shibagaki had been using the academy's finances

395
00:23:11,512 --> 00:23:13,312
and was told to say nothing because he would give her a share of it.

396
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:15,712
That scared her, so she parted from him.

397
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,312
If the academy goes bankrupt,

398
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,112
the money he embezzled would also be thrown in the dark.

399
00:23:20,112 --> 00:23:21,812
So, the culprit was thinking in term

400
00:23:21,812 --> 00:23:24,612
of making gain for himself, after all.

401
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:28,112
It seems that thanks to Misaki's support,

402
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:30,412
her mother is back on her feet again.

403
00:23:30,412 --> 00:23:32,912
They're going to continue running this academy, then.

404
00:23:37,712 --> 00:23:39,612
"Next Episode" -Could that be...

405
00:23:39,612 --> 00:23:40,812
It's a UFO!

406
00:23:40,812 --> 00:23:42,512
The Adamsky type!

407
00:23:42,512 --> 00:23:44,712
UFO?

408
00:23:44,712 --> 00:23:48,812
Like I said, I'll pay off everything I owe you tomorrow!

409
00:23:51,612 --> 00:23:54,412
UFO.

410
00:23:57,312 --> 00:24:00,512
You seem to have realized something.

411
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,112
Sort of...

412
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:03,712
Next Conan,

413
00:24:03,712 --> 00:24:07,612
"Unbelievable! UFO Crashes"

414
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:25,712
Next Conan Hint:

415
00:24:25,712 --> 00:24:27,812
"Hanging scroll"

416
00:24:27,812 --> 00:24:29,012
Even after the holidays is Kogoro week!

417
00:24:29,012 --> 00:24:30,512
All you're going to do is sleep because you don't have work, right?

418
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:32,412
He's sleeping even when he works, though.
