1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,670
The encounter with a certain girl

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,170
was what triggered Inspector Shiratori

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,170
to become a police officer.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,070
The Inspector was sure that the girl was Officer Sato,

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,570
however, it turns out that our homeroom teacher,

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,970
Ms. Kobayashi was that girl.

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,870
Ms. Kobayashi happened to run into a murder being committed.

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,370
The person who was killed

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,770
was the woman owner of a pawn shop named Ms. Akira Sumida.

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,170
Many people seemed to have a grudge against her

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,070
for the evil way she did business.

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,970
Three clues were acquired from the questioning

13
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,370
that Ms. Kobayashi underwent with Inspector Shiratori.

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,470
The first, is the argument that she heard

15
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,170
at the site between the killer and the victim.

16
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,370
The second, was a mover's truck like vehicle

17
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,470
that was parked near the scene of the crime.

18
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:54,370
And, the third was the silhouette of the killer

19
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,170
that Ms. Kobayashi witnessed.

20
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,270
Brooding over passing seasons

21
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,270
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

22
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,070
Inspector Shiratori and Ms. Kobayashi.

23
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,270
Where is the case and love affair headed toward?

24
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,970
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,770
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:59,601
"Inspector Shiratori's Heartbreak"

28
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:02,701
Like I said,

29
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:06,101
I was at home alone watching TV.

30
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:08,901
Because I soccer game that I didn't want to miss was on air.

31
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:11,601
"Kikuna Kagitan (25)" -If it hadn't been for that program,

32
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:13,401
I would've wanted to go killer her myself.

33
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,201
Did you hate her that much?

34
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:18,501
Yes. I was hard up for money

35
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:20,601
so I gave my mother's keepsake ring up to the pawn shop

36
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,901
as reluctant as I was,

37
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,701
but when I went to ask her to wait a while longer

38
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:25,101
because I couldn't come up with enough money in time

39
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:26,201
to buy back the ring,

40
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:28,901
I saw her wearing the ring.

41
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:31,401
But, she told me, "If it's that cheap ring,

42
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:33,101
it got bought right away.

43
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:35,401
This ring looks like it, but it's a different one.

44
00:03:35,401 --> 00:03:38,501
It costs 20 times more than the other one too."

45
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,801
She had the nerve to say something like that!

46
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:43,201
How about it? You'd want to kill her too, wouldn't you?

47
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:45,601
Well... no...

48
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,901
Inspector?

49
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:50,401
"Ryoko Takimoto (31)" -I hope you're not thinking

50
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:51,901
that I killer her?

51
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:53,401
Well, no...

52
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:56,401
But, on the day that she was killed,

53
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:58,201
you said you took off from work

54
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:00,501
and was sleeping alone in your room.

55
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:02,601
I can't help it.

56
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:05,801
My cold took a bad turn.

57
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,701
And, what is your relationship with the victim?

58
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:11,301
I heard that you really hated her.

59
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:13,901
I didn't really hate her.

60
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:15,401
The antique plate that I bought

61
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:19,701
from that pawn shop for 500,000 yen smelled funny,

62
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:22,101
so I had an expert check on it and found...

63
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:26,001
that it was a well-made replica costing 300 yen.

64
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:29,401
Moreover, the smell that was on the plate was that of cat food,

65
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:33,901
because she fed her cat using that plate,

66
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:36,501
but I don't hate her at all.

67
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:42,901
Yes, it's true

68
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:47,001
that she loaned me money about 500,000 yen.

69
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:48,501
I finally came up with the cash

70
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:50,501
and was ready to give it back to her,

71
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:53,301
but how can I now that she's dead.

72
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:54,601
"Ryusuke Kodama (27)" -To proof my innocence,

73
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:57,101
the time that she is dead,

74
00:04:57,101 --> 00:05:01,301
I was drunk and totally out.

75
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,101
But, I heard that even the day before she was killed

76
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:08,001
she went to your apartment shouting

77
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:09,801
that she wanted her money back.

78
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:12,301
She was just putting on an act, an act.

79
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:15,701
She used to put on that kind of act to come and see me.

80
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:18,501
After all, I'm a former hero of high school baseball.

81
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:21,601
Well, I hurt my left shoulder before

82
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,601
I was drafted and couldn't become a professional player,

83
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:26,101
so I don't think anyone remembers me though.

84
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:27,501
In other words...

85
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:31,001
That woman was in love with me.

86
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,001
Do you get it?

87
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:36,201
You're able to record the voices of all three suspects, right?

88
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:37,501
Yes.

89
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:39,901
All we need to do is to have Ms. Kobayashi check it

90
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:41,401
and we're done.

91
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:44,501
Well, it seems that the killer is a woman,

92
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:47,501
so I guess the man has nothing to do with the case.

93
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:50,801
What kind of person is that Ms. Kobayashi?

94
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:52,601
I heard that Inspector Shiratori is head over

95
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:54,601
heels over her from Yumi.

96
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:56,101
She's Conan and the others homeroom teacher

97
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:57,801
at their elementary school.

98
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:59,401
It seems that they coincidentally got to know each other the other day,

99
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,801
because of the incident.

100
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:04,201
I was under the impression that Inspector Shiratori

101
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:05,501
liked someone who was working

102
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:08,501
inside the metropolitan police department here,

103
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,401
but I guess I was mistaken.

104
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:14,001
It was you, you.

105
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:17,201
At any rate, will you let me see her?

106
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:20,001
I think you'd be better off not seeing her.

107
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:21,801
Why shouldn't I meet her?

108
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:24,201
Well... That's because there are many things involved.

109
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:26,401
A lot of things involved, is not an answer, is it?

110
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:27,901
It's just not a good idea...

111
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:30,201
She really is here.

112
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:32,201
The one who looks just like me.

113
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:33,801
If I remember correctly, her name is...

114
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:36,601
Ms. Miwako Sato.

115
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:38,101
How envious...

116
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:41,701
I wanted to be a woman detective too.

117
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:45,701
Really, that Takagi is making lovey dovey again

118
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:48,001
with our Miwako.

119
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:53,601
I think he's getting carried away

120
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:55,901
because Shiratori backed off.

121
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:56,901
Yes.

122
00:06:56,901 --> 00:07:03,401
After all, he was the top in charge of protecting Miwako Sato.

123
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:06,601
Shiratori, really made out, didn't he?

124
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:10,501
Yes. I didn't think she would look that much like Sato.

125
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:13,401
I wonder if there's another one somewhere?

126
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:16,601
-That teacher's the last. -Yes, right?

127
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,301
Ms. Kobayashi.

128
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:19,401
Thank you for waiting.

129
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:23,801
What's the matter, Ms. Kobayashi?

130
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:26,501
Ms. Kobayashi?

131
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:34,001
"This ring looks like it, but it's a different one.

132
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:37,201
It costs 20 times more than the other one too."

133
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:39,301
She had the nerve to say something like that!

134
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:43,401
How about it? You'd want to kill her too, wouldn't you?

135
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:47,801
This is the voice of the first suspect, Ms. Kikuna Kagitani.

136
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,801
I see.

137
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:53,401
This next one is...

138
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:56,701
Moreover, the smell that was on the plate was that of cat food,

139
00:07:56,701 --> 00:08:01,101
because she fed her cat using that plate,

140
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:05,201
but I don't hate her at all!

141
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:08,701
The voice of the second suspect, Ms. Ryoko Takimoto.

142
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:10,201
I see.

143
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:13,001
And, the next one is the voice of the third suspect

144
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,901
Mr. Ryusuke Kodama.

145
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:18,101
Well, I don't think he's part of it

146
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:19,801
because he is a man, but just to be safe.

147
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:22,601
If he's not part of it, why bother?

148
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:27,301
I see.

149
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:30,501
So, out of the two voices of the women

150
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:33,201
you just listened to do you remember hearing either one?

151
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:35,701
The voice that you heard at the scene of the crime,

152
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:39,001
which voice sounded like the shouting of the killer?

153
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:42,601
I selected and had you listen to the part

154
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:46,601
where both women got excited during the interrogation.

155
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:50,301
Teacher.

156
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:51,701
What's wrong?

157
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:53,901
You heard the voice of the killer, didn't you?

158
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,901
I think it was different from either of their voices.

159
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:04,501
The woman's voice I heard was lower and gruffer.

160
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,301
I see.

161
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:09,501
So, I think you should look for another suspect

162
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:12,001
or that it would be better if you talk to the person

163
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:15,001
who was driving the mover-like truck

164
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:17,101
that I saw move away.

165
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:20,101
About that vehicle...

166
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,901
We can't find it

167
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:25,901
a car with large prints of "0" and "9" on it.

168
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:27,501
No.

169
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,601
Maybe you saw different numbers?

170
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:34,101
If the wall was in the way and blocked

171
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:37,801
you vision "5" and "9" resemble each other.

172
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,301
Just because they look alike,

173
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:41,001
I wouldn't make a mistake!

174
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:43,101
Not me!

175
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:44,501
"Not me"?

176
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:49,201
Well, it could be that the car stopped

177
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:52,101
by there because of something besides work too.

178
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:55,801
Of course, we took that into consideration too

179
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:58,401
and pried deeper.

180
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:01,201
Moreover, we asked the residents

181
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,201
who live in the vicinity too.

182
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:06,301
Nobody seems to have called the movers

183
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,901
or a delivery truck either.

184
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:09,701
Then are you saying that...

185
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:11,901
I'm saying something unreliable,

186
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:13,301
leading the police into confusion,

187
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:16,701
and making fun of all of you here at the station?

188
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:19,001
No way.

189
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:23,201
I've already told you everything

190
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:25,001
that I've seen and heard, so...

191
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,301
if you will excuse me, I would like to leave.

192
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:28,901
Let me drive you home.

193
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:31,901
There's a possibility that you may run into the suspects too, so...

194
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:35,001
I'll be fine.

195
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,801
I can very well take of myself, thank you.

196
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:42,501
Will you please let me be already?

197
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:43,801
Goodbye.

198
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:46,601
Mr. Shiratori.

199
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:49,501
Teacher.

200
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:51,301
Inspector Shiratori.

201
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:54,701
I think you should take Ms. Kobayashi home.

202
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:57,501
After all, the killer has seen her face.

203
00:10:57,501 --> 00:10:59,501
Yes.

204
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:00,801
Officer Chiba,

205
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:02,101
could I ask you to take her home?

206
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:05,501
Sure, but are you sure about it?

207
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:06,701
Yes.

208
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:10,001
It seems that she doesn't like me anymore.

209
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:13,501
Ms. Kobayashi! Please wait.

210
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,001
Hey, you!

211
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:20,801
Why doesn't she like you anymore?

212
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:22,601
Did you say something you shouldn't have to her?

213
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:24,201
I have no idea.

214
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:27,401
There's only one thing thinkable.

215
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:31,301
I think it's because Ms. Kobayashi met Officer Sato.

216
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:35,901
What? Ms. Kobayashi met Officer Sato?

217
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:38,401
In addition, if she found out that you

218
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:41,301
were head over heels over Officer Sato,

219
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,501
I'm sure that Ms. Kobayashi would think

220
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:46,501
Inspector Shiratori is kind to her

221
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:49,001
only because she looks like Officer Sato.

222
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:52,801
That maybe she was just a substitute for Officer Sato.

223
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:56,201
No, Ms. Kobayashi is not a substitute,

224
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:59,001
but rather, she's my destiny.

225
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:02,901
But, it's a fact that you mistook the woman of your destiny

226
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:04,401
for Officer Sato, right?

227
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:06,901
I don't mean to deny that but...

228
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:09,901
I think it's about time you tell her, don't you?

229
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:12,401
That Ms. Kobayashi is the person of your destiny

230
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:15,001
who during your childhood,

231
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,501
you tried to protect at a bookstore from some shoplifters.

232
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:21,201
Of course, I feel that way too, but...

233
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:24,201
I couldn't find the right timing to tell her about it.

234
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,001
Hello! Inspector in love.

235
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:29,301
How were the voices of the suspects?

236
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:30,801
She already listened to them, didn't she?

237
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:35,901
Yes, but it seems that none of them had the voice she heard.

238
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:36,901
Is that so?

239
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:40,601
And? Where's the teacher that Shiratori is head over heels over?

240
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:41,901
Well...

241
00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:45,601
Since you said that you wanted to meet her at all cost.

242
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:47,301
Mr. Shiratori?

243
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,501
That...

244
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:57,201
Well... I don't think I should, at least not right now.

245
00:12:57,201 --> 00:12:58,201
What?

246
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:02,703
"Next day in school"

247
00:13:03,503 --> 00:13:04,503
Goodbye.

248
00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:06,303
-Bye, teacher! -Bye, teacher!

249
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:07,903
Yes, goodbye.

250
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:09,803
Bye, teacher!

251
00:13:09,803 --> 00:13:12,303
Goodbye, don't run, it's dangerous!

252
00:13:12,303 --> 00:13:14,203
Okay!

253
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:20,003
Teacher, doesn't look too cheerful.

254
00:13:20,003 --> 00:13:21,903
I wonder if she hasn't heard

255
00:13:21,903 --> 00:13:25,003
from Inspector Shiratori that she's the woman of his destiny.

256
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:28,103
Okay, maybe I should go tell her then?

257
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:29,703
No!

258
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:33,003
It's not romantic unless he tells her himself!

259
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:38,403
But, if left as is, she'll probably end up never knowing.

260
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:40,603
Well, maybe all for the better?

261
00:13:40,603 --> 00:13:43,603
After all there's a great big liar who's not disclosing his identity

262
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:45,603
for the longest time even to the one he loves.

263
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:46,703
Hey.

264
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:49,703
But, I wonder why the person

265
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,203
with the killer's voice wasn't there?

266
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:55,503
Yes. I heard that there were only three suspects

267
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:57,803
who had a grudge against the victim Mrs. Sumida

268
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,003
as well as not have an alibi.

269
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:00,603
Three people.

270
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:03,503
We only heard the voices of two people, right?

271
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:05,503
That's why...

272
00:14:05,503 --> 00:14:08,103
the third suspect is a man, they cut him out

273
00:14:08,103 --> 00:14:12,403
because the voice that teacher heard was that of a woman!

274
00:14:12,403 --> 00:14:14,203
By the way...

275
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:16,503
Mr. Ryunosuke Kodama who was cut out

276
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:20,403
used to be a hot high school baseball player

277
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:23,403
but he hurt his shoulder and wasn't drafted.

278
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:27,103
He seems to be working at a host club now.

279
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:29,603
But, unable to give up his dream,

280
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:31,703
he was trying to get up the ladder

281
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:34,303
joining a baseball club team in between his work time.

282
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:37,603
But, he seriously hurt his shoulder again

283
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:40,303
and this time had to really give up playing.

284
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:43,103
You really know the details, don't you?

285
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:45,703
Yes. Because after that,

286
00:14:45,703 --> 00:14:47,403
Officer Takagi gave me the details.

287
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:49,403
Then, what about the remaining two?

288
00:14:49,403 --> 00:14:51,203
Let's see... the first one,

289
00:14:51,203 --> 00:14:54,303
Ms. Kikuna Kagitani is unemployed.

290
00:14:54,303 --> 00:14:56,303
She was previously the leader of a women motorbike gang.

291
00:14:56,303 --> 00:14:58,403
But, she got into an accident and hurt someone,

292
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:00,603
so her driver's license is suspended for now.

293
00:15:00,603 --> 00:15:02,703
Leader of a motorbike gang?

294
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:05,503
Yes, if she calls out,

295
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:08,003
she could easily gather at least 100 people.

296
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:11,603
Maybe she's the killer?

297
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:13,803
I wonder... But, because of that accident,

298
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:16,003
she had to come up with fee for court

299
00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:18,503
as well as gratuity cash, so she was in need of money.

300
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:19,903
What about the last one?

301
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:21,003
Yeah.

302
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,603
Ms. Ryoko Takimoto is the owner of a Japanese cuisine restaurant

303
00:15:24,603 --> 00:15:26,603
and daughter of a rich family.

304
00:15:26,603 --> 00:15:28,403
It seems that she was deceived

305
00:15:28,403 --> 00:15:30,003
into buying a plate worth nothing,

306
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:32,103
and in order to get back the cash she paid for it,

307
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:34,103
she dished out a large amount of cash

308
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:35,603
to hire an attorney in preparation

309
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:38,703
to charge a complaint against Ms. Sumida who was killed.

310
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:42,403
Well, she seems to have been having discussions with her lawyers,

311
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:43,903
not even taking time out for sleeping and caught a cold.

312
00:15:43,903 --> 00:15:46,303
The last time she was summoned by the police,

313
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,403
she was also wearing a mask.

314
00:15:48,403 --> 00:15:49,603
A mask?

315
00:15:49,603 --> 00:15:53,303
I see. She deliberately wore a mask to hide her voice.

316
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:55,603
I thought the same thing in the beginning too,

317
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:58,803
but the masks nowadays are thin and let the voice through.

318
00:15:58,803 --> 00:16:02,103
Her voice didn't sound muffled either.

319
00:16:02,103 --> 00:16:05,703
But, if the voice of the killer that teacher heard was that of a woman,

320
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:09,903
and if one of the two of them is the killer,

321
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:12,003
then wouldn't the one who was wearing the mask

322
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:14,103
be the most suspicious?

323
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:18,003
That's what's bothering me.

324
00:16:18,003 --> 00:16:20,903
How did Ms. Kobayashi know that it was the voice of the killer

325
00:16:20,903 --> 00:16:23,003
when all she did was hear the voice?

326
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:25,003
Of course, she would know.

327
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:27,203
Because the woman shouted,

328
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:30,503
"Give that to me. I'll kill you!"

329
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:33,303
Besides, Ms. Kobayashi said that the killer who got away,

330
00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:35,303
had pretty big breasts.

331
00:16:35,303 --> 00:16:38,803
But, the victim Ms. Sumida is also a woman.

332
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:44,303
It could be that Ms. Sumida was the one who said, "I'll kill you."

333
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,603
Right. After being told, "I'll kill you"...

334
00:16:46,603 --> 00:16:47,803
The person may have in an act of aggression

335
00:16:47,803 --> 00:16:49,503
from fear took drastic action.

336
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:51,903
And the car that Ms. Kobayashi said

337
00:16:51,903 --> 00:16:56,003
that she saw move away with the number "0" and "9" on it...

338
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:58,003
Why can't it be found?

339
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:01,903
There was no number on the car of the person

340
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:04,803
that doctor helped move the other day either.

341
00:17:04,803 --> 00:17:07,403
Did you see that car?

342
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:10,203
No. I asked, just in case.

343
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:13,303
Whether there were any numbers on the car.

344
00:17:13,303 --> 00:17:17,603
The name of the mover was "Osaka Niko Niko Transport Co."

345
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,703
It had no number on it,

346
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:21,303
just the name of the company in big print.

347
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:24,603
Company name... was it?

348
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:27,903
Doctor said that the driver of the truck

349
00:17:27,903 --> 00:17:29,803
wasn't used to Tokyo,

350
00:17:29,803 --> 00:17:31,403
and the car navigator was not working too well either,

351
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:33,203
so he got lost.

352
00:17:33,203 --> 00:17:35,903
Then, they started moving after 8 pm,

353
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:38,103
so it was a lot of trouble.

354
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:39,603
Genta.

355
00:17:39,603 --> 00:17:42,103
You've been in deep for some time now.

356
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,203
Is something bothering you?

357
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:47,903
What? No...

358
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:50,803
My cavity hurts so I was just holding it down.

359
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,103
A cavity?

360
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:53,203
You've been talking about it

361
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:55,103
from before summer vacation, haven't you?

362
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:57,503
I don't like going to the dentist.

363
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,603
Then, just stop posing in a way

364
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:03,503
to make others worry and hurry on off to the dentist.

365
00:18:03,503 --> 00:18:06,903
I see... Maybe...

366
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:10,703
Inspector Shiratori?

367
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:13,103
What brings you here?

368
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:15,303
Haven't I already told you

369
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,103
that I have nothing more to tell the police?

370
00:18:17,103 --> 00:18:19,303
Yes, but...

371
00:18:19,303 --> 00:18:21,903
after checking a lot of things since then,

372
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:24,003
we've come to the conclusion that the suspects that we've come up

373
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:27,203
with are the only ones that could be the killer.

374
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:28,403
So, will you please listen

375
00:18:28,403 --> 00:18:29,803
to the voices of the three suspects once again?

376
00:18:29,803 --> 00:18:31,903
There's no need for that.

377
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,203
I already told you, didn't I?

378
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:36,103
That no one in the voice that I heard in the recorder

379
00:18:36,103 --> 00:18:37,703
matched the voice of the killer.

380
00:18:37,703 --> 00:18:40,203
Or, are you accusing me of lying?

381
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,403
I'm lying.

382
00:18:42,403 --> 00:18:44,203
Me wanting you to confirm the voices

383
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:48,003
of the suspects again is just an excuse.

384
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:52,203
I really came to see you.

385
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:54,203
To undo the misunderstanding between us.

386
00:18:54,203 --> 00:18:57,303
I haven't misunderstood anything.

387
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,703
Looks good!

388
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:02,403
Go for it, Inspector Shiratori!

389
00:19:02,403 --> 00:19:06,503
The fact is, the incident that occurred the other day

390
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:09,303
is not the first time I saw you.

391
00:19:09,303 --> 00:19:12,603
I've met you long, long time ago.

392
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:14,703
The little girl that stopped some boys

393
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:17,503
from shoplifting in a bookstore.

394
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:20,003
Bookstore? Shoplifting?

395
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:21,503
Yes.

396
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:24,603
I was moved by that girl.

397
00:19:24,603 --> 00:19:27,503
That's why I became a police officer.

398
00:19:27,503 --> 00:19:30,603
After seeing how courageous you were.

399
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,403
Courageous... Police officer...

400
00:19:35,103 --> 00:19:38,903
How about it? Do you remember?

401
00:19:38,903 --> 00:19:42,103
No. I'm sorry, but I don't remember.

402
00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:43,203
What?

403
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:45,603
Besides, isn't that girl...

404
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:49,303
I think you've mistaken Officer Sato for me, haven't you?

405
00:19:49,303 --> 00:19:51,103
No, that's...

406
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:53,303
If you will excuse me...

407
00:19:53,303 --> 00:19:54,803
Wait.

408
00:19:58,003 --> 00:19:59,003
Teacher.

409
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:16,803
Goodbye, Ms. Kobayashi.

410
00:20:16,803 --> 00:20:18,703
I'll be leaving now,

411
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:21,103
so please make sure you lock all the doors.

412
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:23,403
Yes.

413
00:20:23,403 --> 00:20:24,703
Goodbye.

414
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,203
Bye.

415

"Incoming call, 8:27 pm"

416
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,303
Yes, this is Teitan Elementary.

417
00:20:57,303 --> 00:20:59,003
I'm sorry to be calling so late.

418
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:00,903
I'm calling from the police.

419
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:03,203
May I speak to Ms. Kobayashi please?

420
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:05,703
I'm Kobayashi.

421
00:21:05,703 --> 00:21:08,203
I said I have nothing more to tell the police.

422
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:10,603
The car with the numbers "0" and "9"

423
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,303
that you witnessed has been found.

424
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:15,603
We've taken a picture of it,

425
00:21:15,603 --> 00:21:17,403
so I was wondering if you could confirm it.

426
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:22,503
Yes. Then please come with that picture at a later date.

427
00:21:22,503 --> 00:21:25,603
No, since I wanted you to confirm it right away,

428
00:21:25,603 --> 00:21:27,903
I had the guard open the gate for me,

429
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:29,103
and I'm already in the school building.

430
00:21:29,103 --> 00:21:31,203
I see.

431
00:21:31,203 --> 00:21:33,003
Then, please come to the teachers' room.

432
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:35,003
How about the music room?

433
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:37,603
The thing is, this is my alma mater,

434
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:39,503
and I used to belong to the brass band club.

435
00:21:39,503 --> 00:21:42,803
I felt so nostalgic that I was looking around here and there.

436
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,803
Really?

437
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,503
I'll see you in the music room, then.

438
00:21:46,503 --> 00:21:48,403
Yes, I'll be waiting for you.

439
00:21:50,203 --> 00:21:52,603
This school is his alma mater?

440
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,603
I wonder what year he graduated.

441
00:21:55,603 --> 00:21:59,003
Maybe he used to be my classmate.

442
00:22:08,903 --> 00:22:12,903
But the music room was renovated last year

443
00:22:12,903 --> 00:22:15,703
and all the walls and desks were changed,

444
00:22:15,703 --> 00:22:17,803
so how could he feel nostalgic?

445
00:22:20,003 --> 00:22:24,003
Besides, his voice just now sounds familiar.

446
00:23:55,503 --> 00:23:58,903
It seems that your trump card didn't work for you.

447
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:02,503
If we can prove that her testimony was correct,

448
00:24:02,503 --> 00:24:05,403
maybe she'll open her heart.

449
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:06,403
Who is it?

450
00:24:09,303 --> 00:24:10,303
Was someone there?

451
00:24:10,303 --> 00:24:13,903
Yes, a suspicious looking silhouetted figure

452
00:24:13,903 --> 00:24:15,703
was looking in on us.

453
00:24:19,603 --> 00:24:21,103
Next Conan,
