1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,700
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,100
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,600
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,500
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,700
Just a planned, Kir is returned to the Organization,

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,700
but he is suspected by Gin and ordered to kill Akai.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,100
The murder that occurred in New Beika Hotel was...

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,500
Are you sure we can get the culprit that way?

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,600
Yep, because it's a spell that Shinichi told me about,

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,500
so I'm sure it'll work.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,300
When all four get here,

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,600
I start by saying...

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,700
Shiraunplee!

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,100
Thanks to the magic spell, the case was solved smoothly.

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
In the meantime,

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,300
FBI agent Akai was being summoned by Kir of the Black Organization,

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,700
also known as CIA informant Rena Mizunashi,

18
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,400
and heading towards the specified meeting place, Raiha Pass.

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,400
Sizzling hot suspense.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,000
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,800
The final gun shot echoes through the ridge.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,000
What will become of FBI agent, Shuichi Akai?

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,500
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,100
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,200
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

26
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:09,800
"Red and Black Crash: Killed on Duty"

27
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,868
CIA?

28
00:04:00,978 --> 00:04:02,378
Just what're you talking about?

29
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:04,878
What does that have to do with you, Sis?

30
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,278
Hey, wait! I don't get it!

31
00:04:07,278 --> 00:04:08,978
Huh? Hey...

32
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:10,278
I'm not finished talking to you yet.

33
00:04:11,978 --> 00:04:14,378
Ei-chan.

34
00:04:19,578 --> 00:04:20,678
Father.

35
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,878
Don't give up, Hidemi.

36
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:24,478
If you keep on waiting,

37
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:26,178
friends will surely appear.

38
00:04:27,378 --> 00:04:29,778
Promise you'll complete my mission for me.

39
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:17,978
What...

40
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:19,778
What's up?

41
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:23,078
Coming from the opposite direction.

42
00:05:25,078 --> 00:05:26,878
I got a head start

43
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:29,278
and checked up on a lot of things.

44
00:05:29,278 --> 00:05:30,878
Really?

45
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:33,178
And...

46
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:35,678
Were you able to get what you wanted?

47
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:39,678
The confirmation that I came here alone.

48
00:05:42,978 --> 00:05:44,378
Yeah.

49
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:47,178
I guess you did.

50
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:51,678
And what information are you giving me

51
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:55,078
in exchange for helping you whip off?

52
00:05:58,578 --> 00:06:01,778
Yes. The thing I can give you is...

53
00:06:56,578 --> 00:06:59,078
Porsche 356A.

54
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:05,078
So, that's the story.

55
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:16,478
What's up, Kir?

56
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,778
Finish him off quick.

57
00:07:19,778 --> 00:07:21,278
But...

58
00:07:21,278 --> 00:07:23,678
I shot him through his lungs,

59
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:26,978
so he'll die if left as is in about 30 minutes.

60
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:29,478
His head...

61
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:33,878
Shoot the bullet through his head.

62
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:37,878
And see that he completely stops breathing.

63
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:41,178
Roger.

64
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:02,278
I didn't think I was going to end here.

65
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:04,978
I'm surprised too

66
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:07,978
that everything worked out so smoothly.

67
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:37,478
Police.

68
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:42,578
It seems that there was an accident nearby.

69
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:47,378
Kir, get rid of him and split.

70
00:08:47,378 --> 00:08:48,778
Roger.

71
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:59,278
I had no choice...

72
00:09:29,478 --> 00:09:31,178
What the...

73
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:35,078
Hurry, contact the station!

74
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:36,178
Yes, sir!

75
00:09:50,578 --> 00:09:52,878
Why? Why aren't you answering

76
00:09:52,878 --> 00:09:55,878
when the cellphone that I borrowed from Conan is finally connecting?

77
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:56,878
Huh?

78
00:09:56,878 --> 00:09:59,378
Shu's not answering the phone.

79
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:01,778
Maybe he's taking a cat nap.

80
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:03,378
Mr. Akai didn't seem to have much sleep

81
00:10:03,378 --> 00:10:05,378
since the start of this case.

82
00:10:05,378 --> 00:10:06,978
I tell you...

83
00:10:06,978 --> 00:10:08,378
What shall we do, Conan?

84
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:11,978
You said before that when we, the FBI withdraw from the hospital,

85
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,578
you wanted to come, right?

86
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:16,278
Yeah.

87
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:18,478
Would you like to come with us now?

88
00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:20,578
I was thinking of doing so,

89
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,378
but I guess it would be a bother

90
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:25,578
to have a kid running around too.

91
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:28,678
Besides, today is Friday, the 13th.

92
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:31,078
I think it would be better for me

93
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:32,978
to head on home and hit the sack.

94
00:10:32,978 --> 00:10:35,378
See you later, Jodie.

95
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:38,378
Friday the 13th?

96
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:40,878
Huh?

97
00:10:40,878 --> 00:10:42,178
Be careful.

98
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,578
I have this bad feeling today.

99
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:51,178
Oh, it's because today is Friday the 13th, right?

100
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,578
I don't believe in such things.

101
00:10:57,978 --> 00:11:00,278
I see.

102
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:07,934
Huh?

103
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:12,034
Shu... Shu was summoned by Rena Mizunashi and went to see her?

104
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:13,034
Yeah.

105
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:18,434
He got a call from her right after you left.

106
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:20,534
He said he'd be seeing her, just the two of them.

107
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:22,034
Just the two of them...

108
00:11:22,034 --> 00:11:24,134
I'm sure it's a trap!

109
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:26,734
Why didn't you stop him?

110
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:29,134
Well, I did, actually.

111
00:11:29,134 --> 00:11:30,434
He insisted that he had to go,

112
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:33,534
because if he didn't, her life would be in danger.

113
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:35,434
But, Akai can handle himself well,

114
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:37,834
so, I don't think there's need for worry.

115
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:40,134
That...

116
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:44,034
They were going to meet in Raiha Pass, right?

117
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:45,534
Yeah.

118
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:48,934
I saw on the TV news just now

119
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:51,734
that a car was up in flames at Raiha Pass

120
00:11:51,734 --> 00:11:54,434
and a burnt body seems to have been found inside.

121
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:56,034
-Huh? -What?

122
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:59,534
The car that went up in flames was a black Chevy,

123
00:11:59,534 --> 00:12:03,034
and found inside was a man in his 20's or 30's.

124
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:05,734
The car was found by a police officer

125
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:08,534
who was coincidentally on his way to another scene of an accident.

126
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:10,634
According to an eye-witness report by that officer,

127
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:13,534
he says that the car suddenly exploded right in front of his eyes.

128
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:16,934
And from the fact that the body seems to have been shot,

129
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:20,234
the police is investigating this case as homicide.

130
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:22,934
They hope to identify the body by what little is left of the license plate

131
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:23,934
and the right hand of the body...

132
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:26,034
No! That isn't Shu!

133
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:29,034
He set someone from the Organization up in his place!

134
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:30,834
I'm sure that he would do so!

135
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,034
I agree!

136
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:34,434
"Car fire, Mysterious gunshot" -I'm sure we can confirm things easily

137
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:36,434
if we go to the police department!

138
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:41,534
But, can we make confirmation when the body is burnt?

139
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:43,534
If the right hand of the body is still there,

140
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:46,434
we could confirm by matching it to Akai's fingerprints.

141
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:49,334
Then, we could match it to Akai's fingerprints

142
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:50,734
that are registered at the FBI.

143
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:52,734
We'd like to match fingerprints,

144
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:54,234
so please lend us his right hand

145
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:58,434
because he maybe one of our agents.

146
00:12:58,434 --> 00:13:00,034
Is that what we're going to say?

147
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:04,234
The same goes for Akai's Chevy.

148
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:07,334
I'm sure that his fingerprints would be somewhere on it,

149
00:13:07,334 --> 00:13:08,434
but now that it's gone up in flames,

150
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:10,634
it'll be retrieved by the police.

151
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:12,634
We couldn't possibly tell them to give it to us,

152
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:14,634
without explaining the reasons.

153
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:20,434
If we could only find a way to match his fingerprints

154
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:24,634
with that of the dead body without being suspected.

155
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:27,934
If we use the cell phone with his fingerprints on it,

156
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:31,034
I'm sure we can successfully match the fingerprints.

157
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:33,434
But, his cell phone is...

158
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:40,334
This is a cell phone that I borrowed from Conan, but...

159
00:13:40,334 --> 00:13:43,434
I'll go out side then and call him on the phone.

160
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:45,834
I think he'll come right away.

161
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,034
Even for you,

162
00:13:49,034 --> 00:13:51,934
that's something that cannot be done.

163
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:54,434
This is work for us, the FBI.

164
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:59,034
We can't involved an ordinary citizen

165
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:00,534
more than we already have.

166
00:14:00,534 --> 00:14:02,634
But...

167
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:06,534
Leave the rest up to us.

168
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:10,334
Then, you have Akai's fingerprints?

169
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:11,434
Yes.

170
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,534
I'll take this and go to the police.

171
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:17,834
Wait, let me give you a lift.

172
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:19,134
I hate to repeat myself,

173
00:14:19,134 --> 00:14:20,434
but make sure you don't tell anyone

174
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:24,034
that the body is one of the members of the FBI.

175
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:26,734
No, I won't tell

176
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:28,334
and I'll make sure no one suspects me either.

177
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:39,534
Huh? He could be the man who picked up your cell phone?

178
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:42,734
You mean the man who was just found burnt to death?

179
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:48,434
Yes, I was coincidentally driving through Raiha Pass today too.

180
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:51,234
We had lunch at a drive-in nearby.

181
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:54,034
But, I must've for some reason dropped it then.

182
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:57,334
And this man seems to have picked my cell phone up for me.

183
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:59,134
That man was also riding a Chevy,

184
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:01,834
so I thought that maybe if it were him.

185
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,534
I could be of help to the investigation

186
00:15:04,534 --> 00:15:07,034
since I remember what he was wearing as well as his face.

187
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:08,334
I see.

188
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:10,934
Then please let me have it.

189
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:17,434
That cell phone is what I borrowed from Conan.

190
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:20,734
So, I think that my fingerprints as well as Conan's are on it too.

191
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:22,134
I understand.

192
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:23,834
I'll check it right away,

193
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,734
so please wait right here.

194
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,734
We've got the results.

195
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:40,034
And...

196
00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:44,034
was I mistaken after all?

197
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,134
Thank you for going out of your way to come.

198
00:15:51,134 --> 00:15:53,634
No problem.

199
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:56,634
I'm really sorry to have troubled you.

200
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:59,834
Not being able to remember clearly the characteristics of that man.

201
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:04,534
Oh, but that body has many unexplainable points to it.

202
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:06,134
So, please let us know

203
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:07,434
if you recall anything else.

204
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:08,934
Yes, of course.

205
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:14,334
Okay, then, thank you so much for everything today.

206
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:20,534
As a result of the investigation,

207
00:16:20,534 --> 00:16:21,834
just as you had mentioned,

208
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:25,434
your fingerprints together with Conan were also found

209
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:27,834
with the fingerprints of the man

210
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:30,434
who just burned to death a while ago.

211
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:35,834
From the looks of it,

212
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:39,134
I guess the body was Akai after all.

213
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:46,634
But, we couldn't possibly blame Rena Mizunashi either.

214
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:49,934
She would've been killed if she didn't kill him

215
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:53,834
and it seems she told Akai that...

216
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:55,634
No matter what happens,

217
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:58,634
the mission of the CIA is top priority to not be offended,

218
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:02,634
even if it turns out to be inconvenient for the FBI.

219
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:05,234
So...

220
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:10,434
Now we've been able to drive a wedge into the Organization.

221
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:13,434
A steel wedge that can never be removed.

222
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,834
Maybe Akai...

223
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:21,834
deliberately became a scapegoat to drive this wedge in.

224
00:17:23,434 --> 00:17:28,234
But, the price was much too high to pay.

225
00:17:28,234 --> 00:17:32,234
Shu...

226
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:41,134
What?

227
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:45,534
I got the blind spot of the rifle.

228
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,834
When did you...

229
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:54,534
Throw down your gun...

230
00:17:54,534 --> 00:17:56,534
If you don't, I'm going to blow your head off.

231
00:18:01,634 --> 00:18:03,234
The sound of a pump?

232
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:04,834
A shot gun?

233
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,034
Okay, Calvados,

234
00:18:07,034 --> 00:18:08,634
we'll take her from both sides.

235
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:12,934
Oh no...

236
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:14,134
They're coming from behind.

237
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:31,634
Go on, Calvados.

238
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:34,434
Use that Remington of yours

239
00:18:34,434 --> 00:18:38,134
to blow over that little kitty of the FBI.

240
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:40,934
Oh, so that guy's name is...

241
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:43,734
Calvados.

242
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:50,734
He had a rifle, a shotgun and three pistols on him.

243
00:18:52,234 --> 00:18:56,034
So I thought he was a weapon vendor or something.

244
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,034
Shuichi Akai?

245
00:18:58,034 --> 00:18:59,234
Shu.

246
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:11,834
Don't kill her, Shu!

247
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:24,034
Blowing up the gas tank

248
00:19:24,034 --> 00:19:27,134
using the side mirror from that position.

249
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:28,434
Quite a marksman.

250
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,534
Shu.

251
00:19:30,534 --> 00:19:32,134
This is no time to be amazed!

252
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:36,134
They took the hostage and fled!

253
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,834
You should never leave your keys in the car.

254
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:43,734
Okay, I'll leave the rest to you.

255
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:48,034
I can't afford to come face to face

256
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:51,134
with that brown-haired girl yet, you see.

257
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:01,234
Shu.

258
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:05,234
You haven't finished doing all you have to do yet, have you?

259
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:15,334
Shu...

260
00:20:58,134 --> 00:21:00,434
We don't need two bullets.

261
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:04,534
One bullet is enough

262
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:07,934
to get rid of Silver Bread.

263
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:42,334
Here you go.

264
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:45,034
The cell phone that I borrowed from you.

265
00:22:45,034 --> 00:22:47,534
Huh? You don't need it already?

266
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:49,034
No, thank you.

267
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,434
That cell phone in question...

268
00:22:50,434 --> 00:22:53,334
We're going to have to keep it here for a while,

269
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:55,334
so could you hand this cell phone

270
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:58,534
that's the same type as his for the time being?

271
00:22:58,534 --> 00:23:00,234
If you have the SIM card over there,

272
00:23:00,234 --> 00:23:03,534
he should have no problem using it.

273
00:23:03,534 --> 00:23:06,834
Okay, thank you, Conan.

274
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:16,434
The serial number is different.

275
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:18,334
Oh, Jodie.

276
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:21,634
What?

277
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,134
Oh, that...

278
00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:25,834
Hang in there.

279
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:27,334
Yes, I will.

280
00:23:32,534 --> 00:23:33,834
Hey, Conan!

281
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:35,234
Just what're you doing?

282
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:37,034
You're going to be tardy for school!

283
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:45,534
Okay!

284
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:55,234
"Next Episode."

285
00:23:57,734 --> 00:23:59,334
What?

286
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:01,334
Did you hear a strange sound just now?

287
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:04,934
The sounds I heard were...

288
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:07,934
A crash like something bumping into something,

289
00:24:07,934 --> 00:24:10,334
a thud like something falling

290
00:24:10,334 --> 00:24:13,234
and a rattle like something was being rolled along the ground.

291
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:18,934
Next Conan,

292
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:22,934
"Lawyer Eri Kisaki's Testimony, Part One."

293
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:40,634
Next Conan's Hint:

294
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:43,034
Hair.

295
00:24:43,034 --> 00:24:45,034
-Ready go. -Next, an incident occurs at a beauty salon.

296
00:24:45,034 --> 00:24:46,934
-Now, cut! -Great cut.

297
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:48,634
Right?
