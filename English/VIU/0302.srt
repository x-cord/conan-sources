1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,319
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,019
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,719
We'll get to the truth of the bomb threat case.

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,719
The love story of an officer at police headquarters.

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,319
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,419
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,820
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:59,163
When we went to see the victory parade of the Tokyo Spirits,

9
00:01:59,164 --> 00:02:01,263
we, the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

10
00:02:01,264 --> 00:02:04,763
ran into Officer Sato and the others of the police department in disguise.

11
00:02:04,764 --> 00:02:05,963
Since a fax warning of

12
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:08,463
something bad will happen at the parade

13
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:10,963
was sent to police headquarters

14
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,863
so the officers were out investigating and checking the site.

15
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:16,264
Just then Officer Takagi's car...

16
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,864
What is this?

17
00:02:23,364 --> 00:02:24,464
What happened?

18
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:30,163
Inspector Shiratori!

19
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:32,363
Where's Officer Takagi?

20
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:35,663
If he got caught in the explosion,

21
00:02:35,664 --> 00:02:38,163
I doubt that he would make it.

22
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:39,963
Then, you mean that Officer Takagi...

23
00:02:39,964 --> 00:02:41,463
Oh, no.

24
00:02:41,464 --> 00:02:42,863
That's only if the worst happens.

25
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:46,263
What's that supposed to mean?

26
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:49,863
I made it to safety by a hair's breadth,

27
00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:52,563
so please don't talk like I didn't make it!

28
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:54,763
When we were checking to see

29
00:02:54,764 --> 00:02:58,063
if Mitsuhiko who was taking video near the scene

30
00:02:58,064 --> 00:02:59,463
had taken any pictures of the bomber...

31
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:00,464
What?

32
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:02,463
Another bomb went off?

33
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:03,563
Yes.

34
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:07,163
This time it was at the phone booth in front of Haido Park.

35
00:03:07,164 --> 00:03:08,663
From the type of bomb that was used,

36
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:10,563
it's most likely the same bomber.

37
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:14,863
Which means that the bomber is not after us, the police

38
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:16,363
but carried out an extremely heinous prank

39
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:19,463
against the Tokyo Spirits.

40
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:21,663
I wonder if it's really only a prank

41
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:23,464
of bad taste towards the Spirits.

42
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:29,064
And, besides, this tape that Mitsuhiko took.

43
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:33,363
Is something that will point out the bomber

44
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:34,864
really filmed on it?

45
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:37,963
If so,

46
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:40,364
what was filmed?

47
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:48,064
"Parade of Malice and Saints (Part 2)"

48
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,163
Look! Look at this...

49
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:56,463
Don't you think this lady is suspicious?

50
00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:59,263
She's been glaring towards the camera right through!

51
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:02,563
That's right! She looks kind of bothered.

52
00:04:02,564 --> 00:04:04,763
She just doesn't like the idea that Mitsuhiko

53
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:07,563
is filming her mini-skirt from a low angle!

54
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:09,063
But, no...

55
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:10,763
I didn't mean to do anything like that.

56
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:13,263
Then, what about this man with the beard?

57
00:04:13,264 --> 00:04:16,963
He seems to be looking around the ground, doesn't he?

58
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:19,063
Look carefully at his hand!

59
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:22,163
He's holding a child's shoe, right?

60
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:24,263
So, he probably came to the parade

61
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,963
with his wife who was carrying their child

62
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:29,563
and both shoes just happened to come off.

63
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:32,163
So I'm pretty sure he's looking for them.

64
00:04:32,164 --> 00:04:34,963
I see.

65
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:36,863
Hey! Officer Takagi!

66
00:04:36,864 --> 00:04:39,264
You have to tell us some things that you've noticed too.

67
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:44,763
And I'd like to have a word with you later.

68
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,663
-Officer Takagi! -Officer Takagi!

69
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:48,163
Yes?

70
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:49,963
Are you really watching it carefully?

71
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:52,463
I watched it three times already.

72
00:04:52,464 --> 00:04:55,163
But, no matter how many times I look at it, it's the same thing.

73
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:57,463
If you think that the crowd is suspicious,

74
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,563
everybody in the crowd looks suspicious

75
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:01,063
and if you think nothing is suspicious,

76
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:03,663
nothing looks suspicious.

77
00:05:03,664 --> 00:05:07,863
It's virtually impossible to pick the bomber out of this crowd.

78
00:05:07,864 --> 00:05:10,163
That's true.

79
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:13,363
Which means that the bomber would've thought the same thing.

80
00:05:13,364 --> 00:05:15,263
But, the bomber stole the video camera

81
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:18,263
and attempted to remove the tape that was inside.

82
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:20,563
What did he did that for?

83
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:25,263
Maybe the culprit thought he was being filmed

84
00:05:25,264 --> 00:05:26,963
although nothing was filmed?

85
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:28,364
Nothing was filmed?

86
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:30,764
Wait a second.

87
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,764
Nothing was filmed means...

88
00:05:34,364 --> 00:05:35,564
Don't tell me that...

89
00:05:39,064 --> 00:05:40,764
I see.

90
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:45,563
Conan.

91
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:47,263
Was something filmed?

92
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,763
No, nothing really.

93
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:50,863
Then, it's no good?

94
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:53,063
No, not really.

95
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:54,563
The bomber probably

96
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:57,163
want the tape not because something was filmed on it,

97
00:05:57,164 --> 00:05:58,863
but rather because that person

98
00:05:58,864 --> 00:06:01,163
was trying to hide evidence that nothing was filmed!

99
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:03,963
-What? -What?

100
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,963
Just what do you mean?

101
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:10,264
There's something I got to confirm first, though.

102
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:14,063
Hey, Conan. What is going on?

103
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:16,363
What do you mean hide evidence that nothing was filmed?

104
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:19,663
Since nothing was filmed on the tape I took,

105
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:23,663
the bomber didn't have to steal it, right?

106
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:26,163
Conan, wait!

107
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:28,264
Hey, Conan!

108
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:31,763
Just as I thought.

109
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:33,364
It's just as I thought!

110
00:06:35,064 --> 00:06:38,364
What's with the mailbox?

111
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:42,763
You know what time Mitsuhiko climbed on top of the mailbox, don't you?

112
00:06:42,764 --> 00:06:45,863
I don't remember details like that!

113
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,763
We can figure that out by watching the video tape

114
00:06:48,764 --> 00:06:50,763
because the time is also filmed.

115
00:06:50,764 --> 00:06:52,964
That's right!

116
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:59,463
It was the time I was filming

117
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:03,363
something far away by zooming so...

118
00:07:03,364 --> 00:07:07,263
Here it is! It was 2:23 in the afternoon!

119
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:11,263
After that, we ran into Officer Sato

120
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:15,263
and until 14:38 when Mitsuhiko quit taking video,

121
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:18,063
we were by this mailbox, right?

122
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:21,163
So what?

123
00:07:21,164 --> 00:07:23,563
Then, take a look at this!

124
00:07:23,564 --> 00:07:26,963
Look at the time the mail is supposed to be picked up!

125
00:07:26,964 --> 00:07:29,763
On holidays it says about 14:30.

126
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:32,263
That means they should be here

127
00:07:32,264 --> 00:07:33,563
about 2:30 in the afternoon, right?

128
00:07:33,564 --> 00:07:35,263
Yeah.

129
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:36,463
Which means,

130
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:41,663
we didn't see what we were supposed to see, didn't we?

131
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:42,664
Right!

132
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:44,563
The mailman's car!

133
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,863
They never came to pick the mails.

134
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:52,463
But the road was blocked by the parade

135
00:07:52,464 --> 00:07:53,963
so maybe it couldn't come through?

136
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:55,163
No.

137
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:58,163
They usually choose a parade course

138
00:07:58,164 --> 00:08:00,963
that does not interfere with duties of that sort.

139
00:08:00,964 --> 00:08:04,663
Besides, only one lane is being used for the parade

140
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:07,163
that there is no way that the mail truck cannot make its way here.

141
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:09,863
But, if the roads are crowded,

142
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,763
it's easy to be late by about eight minutes.

143
00:08:12,764 --> 00:08:14,663
No way.

144
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:18,263
It didn't look like there was a traffic jam,

145
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,763
and the collection time indicated on the mailbox

146
00:08:20,764 --> 00:08:22,263
is in intervals of five minutes.

147
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:25,363
If there is a discrepancy of five minutes earlier or later,

148
00:08:25,364 --> 00:08:28,463
the only thing I can think of is that something came up.

149
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:31,763
But the one who tried to steal Mitsuhiko's video camera

150
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:33,263
is the bomber, right?

151
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:34,963
Right.

152
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:38,563
What does the mail truck have anything to do with this?

153
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:40,963
And besides, would anyone want to steal

154
00:08:40,964 --> 00:08:43,263
the videotape in the first place?

155
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:44,563
If it was left as is,

156
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:46,863
nobody would've noticed anything,

157
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:48,963
but now, it's like telling everybody

158
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:52,463
that something may be there!

159
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:53,563
Yeah.

160
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:56,763
I guess they didn't intend to steal it either.

161
00:08:56,764 --> 00:08:59,163
If we were just a bunch of ordinary kids

162
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,363
who came to watch the parade.

163
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:03,263
I get it!

164
00:09:03,264 --> 00:09:05,963
Yumi's mini-police car!

165
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:08,863
Since you were witnessed talking intimately with Yumi

166
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:10,863
in front of the mailbox,

167
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:13,463
the culprit tried to get rid of the evidence!

168
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:14,863
Yeah.

169
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:17,763
If a bombing incident takes part nearby,

170
00:09:17,764 --> 00:09:19,563
it means that there is a possibility

171
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:22,863
the bomber would be filmed on the video,

172
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:26,563
and the police would without doubt check the film out.

173
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:29,463
Moreover, if we are acquainted with the police,

174
00:09:29,464 --> 00:09:31,363
the time it would take to check the tape out

175
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:33,963
would be pretty speedy.

176
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:36,963
That's what the bomber was afraid of!

177
00:09:36,964 --> 00:09:41,263
They probably noticed Mitsuhiko's video camera

178
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:43,663
only after they set the bomb up under Officer Takagi's car

179
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:47,163
that was parked right opposite the mailbox.

180
00:09:47,164 --> 00:09:50,663
They couldn't go retrieve the paper bag under the car.

181
00:09:50,664 --> 00:09:53,763
So they decided to get rid of the tape.

182
00:09:53,764 --> 00:09:55,863
I don't understand, though.

183
00:09:55,864 --> 00:09:58,663
The bomber faxed the police to let them know that

184
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,963
something was going to happen, right?

185
00:10:00,964 --> 00:10:02,863
Yes.

186
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:04,963
If they call all the police officers over

187
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:07,263
and blow the car up,

188
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:08,963
it's obvious that the police

189
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:12,863
will come frantically after them.

190
00:10:12,864 --> 00:10:16,063
Maybe they want to distract the police?

191
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:19,963
By pretending to be the same bomber three years ago?

192
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:24,363
Although I have no idea what kind of a case it was.

193
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:26,963
There's a high probability that

194
00:10:26,964 --> 00:10:28,963
the bomber is after the lives of the police force,

195
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:33,063
just as was the case three years ago!

196
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:35,063
You just kind of resembled him.

197
00:10:35,064 --> 00:10:37,663
The you just a while ago.

198
00:10:37,664 --> 00:10:42,163
It seems that the one Officer Sato was trying to rescue was...

199
00:10:42,164 --> 00:10:45,264
And I'd like to have a word with you later.

200
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:51,663
The question is, what the bomber is after.

201
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:52,763
Yeah.

202
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:55,463
It's very likely that the bomber is not after the police

203
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:58,663
nor playing pranks against the Spirits.

204
00:10:58,664 --> 00:11:01,263
If my deduction is correct,

205
00:11:01,264 --> 00:11:04,563
they are after...

206
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,463
But, since I'm still not sure,

207
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:07,963
I want you and Officer Takagi

208
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:09,863
to check something out for me.

209
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:12,863
Aye! You can count on us!

210
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:16,063
Officer Takagi, are you listening?

211
00:11:16,064 --> 00:11:18,163
Yeah.

212
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:20,963
I'm listening...

213
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:22,663
This is Ayumi!

214
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:26,363
Conan, I've found the mailbox!

215
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:28,163
Okay, what's the location of the mailbox

216
00:11:28,164 --> 00:11:29,663
and the collection time?

217
00:11:29,664 --> 00:11:32,963
The mailbox is under the pedestrian overpass, two traffic signals away

218
00:11:32,964 --> 00:11:34,663
from the first mailbox.

219
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:36,963
The collection time is...

220
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:39,863
About 14:35!

221
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:41,063
Okay!

222
00:11:41,064 --> 00:11:43,363
Mitsuhiko here!

223
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:46,263
I've found one in front of the convenience store on Nichome!

224
00:11:46,264 --> 00:11:49,863
The time is about 14:45!

225
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:51,763
This Genta!

226
00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:55,063
I found one near the park on Sanchome.

227
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:57,763
The time is 14:55.

228
00:11:57,764 --> 00:11:58,963
Hey, Genta.

229
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:00,863
Why are you whispering?

230
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:02,563
I can't help

231
00:12:02,564 --> 00:12:05,463
because I went through somebody's yard, which was a short-cut.

232
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:07,863
I was mistaken for a thief after women's underwear,

233
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:11,663
and I'm hiding from the lady who came after me.

234
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,563
I see. Hang in there.

235
00:12:13,564 --> 00:12:15,663
Now all we have to do is wait for Ai.

236
00:12:15,664 --> 00:12:16,864
Yeah.

237
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:20,263
Oh, it's her!

238
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:22,463
This is the woman in black.

239
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:23,663
Hey!

240
00:12:23,664 --> 00:12:26,763
The location of the mailbox is on the side of a bus stop

241
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:30,363
that is about 150m west from the mailbox on Sanchome.

242
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:33,263
The collection time is 16:25.

243
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:35,663
I just saw all of you now.

244
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:37,163
Can you see me?

245
00:12:37,164 --> 00:12:39,163
Yeah!

246
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:44,063
Lastly, the pick up time for this mailbox is...

247
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,164
16:30.

248
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:53,263
So, if I match all the information with the map...

249
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:57,063
The course of the mail truck is like this.

250
00:12:57,064 --> 00:13:00,063
Just like you said, Shinichi,

251
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:01,463
it seems to be getting farther and farther

252
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:03,863
from the course of the parade.

253
00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:07,963
In addition, today is the Sunday before payday.

254
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:11,463
Now, all we have to do is wait for Officer Takagi to contact us.

255
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:13,863
If there were no traffic accidents

256
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:17,663
or road construction is this area today,

257
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,763
the reason the mail truck didn't come

258
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:22,364
to pick up the mail is...

259
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,230
Excuse me.

260
00:13:52,694 --> 00:13:54,229
What's the matter, Mr. Tsutsumi?

261
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,229
If you're dropping off the mail that you collected,

262
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,729
go around the back and...

263
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,329
Well...

264
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:03,929
A large amount of very odd mail is mixed in the bag.

265
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,829
I want everyone to look at it now,

266
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,729
but could you open the front entrance please?

267
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,229
Okay. I understand.

268
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,930
I'll go open it right away.

269
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,329
Thank you so much for the trouble.

270
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,829
No problem.

271
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:40,029
So, what's this odd mail you're talking about?

272
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,930
Well that's...

273
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,129
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

274
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,729
Sorry...

275
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,230
The stuff I wanna show is...

276
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,729
This, Mr. Mailman.

277
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,329
A gun?

278
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,330
Hey!

279
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:04,529
The guys back there come up front here with your hands in the air!

280
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,529
We're here to rob this place!

281
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,029
Hurry it up!

282
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,030
You too! Get with it!

283
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,529
Quit taking your time!

284
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,729
Okay, take it all out, the cash.

285
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,629
It's right before pay day

286
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,929
so I'll bet you're loaded!

287
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,429
I see.

288
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,129
So that's why you chose today,

289
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,129
that would overlap with the Tokyo Spirits parade.

290
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,529
Today, when the employees at the post office

291
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,129
would be reduced because it's a Sunday.

292
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,529
You sent faxes and used bombs to deceive the police

293
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,229
into thinking it had something to do with the bomb case three years ago,

294
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,429
and lured the police out.

295
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:45,029
Then, you make it look like a bad prank towards the Spirits

296
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,429
in order to divert the police attention.

297
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,629
After diverting the police attention,

298
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,429
you attacked the post office using the mail truck you hi-jacked.

299
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,329
Well, it's not such an intelligent idea though.

300
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,029
Hey, you over there!

301
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,929
Cut out your babbling!

302
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,729
Hurry it up and get up here!

303
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,229
So, he says.

304
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,130
Hurry all of you.

305
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,730
Come on, hurry.

306
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,029
Hey, what's going on?

307
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,629
Why...

308
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,829
Why are there so many of you, when it's a Sunday?

309
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,830
Oh, didn't you know?

310
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,529
Although we all belong to civil service,

311
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,129
we're not like the post office employees who have regular days off.

312
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,729
We're on duty 24 hours 365 days a year.

313
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,529
That's how it is for us, the police officers!

314
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,629
Police?

315
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,929
Inspector Megure!

316
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,029
We've taken custody of all the mailmen we found tied up

317
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,429
in the mail trucks!

318
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,629
Good!

319
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,630
You jerk.

320
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,230
Cut it out.

321
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,230
Because your way of thinking isn't wise.

322
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,230
Darn it.

323
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,130
So, the post office robbers were arrested.

324
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,529
The other robbers who set bombs at different places

325
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,229
and were waiting for the others to return

326
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:21,329
were all safely arrested.

327
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,330
And, that night...

328
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,729
But, it's a wonder you figured out

329
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,229
that the bomber's real target

330
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,029
was robbing the post office.

331
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,329
Well, not really...

332
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,529
The kids dropped the hint.

333
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,129
You mean Conan, right?

334
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,829
He's no ordinary kid after all!

335
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,529
Very true.

336
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,129
Oh, right.

337
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,129
I'm sorry about this afternoon,

338
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,429
for slapping you all of a sudden like that.

339
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,729
I'll bet it hurts.

340
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,129
Oh, no.

341
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,429
I'm to blame for not following orders.

342
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,529
Are you all right, Officer Sato?

343
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,129
The burn on the palm of your hands.

344
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,730
I'm fine. Though it still hurts a bit.

345
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,129
Although it still kind of stings

346
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,129
but I guess it will heal soon.

347
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,730
I guess so! I'm glad.

348
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,329
Excuse me...

349
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,429
Officer Sato?

350
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,129
What?

351
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,229
You mentioned earlier that you wanted to talk to me.

352
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,930
Oh, that.

353
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,730
Officer Sato.

354
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,629
Let's call off the date we were planning!

355
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,630
What?

356
00:18:59,631 --> 00:19:01,629
I'm cursed.

357
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,929
Cursed?

358
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:10,229
Because all the people that I cherish vanish from before me.

359
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,129
My father,

360
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,729
my P.E. teacher in elementary school,

361
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,830
my senior in the baseball club and...

362
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,930
And, him too.

363
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,729
I don't want to go through anything like that ever again.

364
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,130
Officer Sato.

365
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,929
So, I'd rather we stay like we are now,

366
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,130
colleagues at the police station.

367
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,430
Officer Sato...

368
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,430
Officer Takagi?

369
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,229
That's the way to go! Go for it, Takagi!

370
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,029
Go! Go!

371
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,030
Go for it, Takagi!

372
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,930
You guys are sort of heavy.

373
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,730
Officer Sato. I...

374
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,930
Officer Takagi?

375
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,730
I will never...

376
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,829
Right.

377
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,229
You and me, we don't really work out to begin with.

378
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,429
Right...

379
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:46,229
I think someone cuter is way better for you!

380
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,429
You think so?

381
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,830
Yes...

382
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,130
You coward.

383
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,930
Bye for now then!

384
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,530
Officer Sato.

385
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,930
Officer Sato.

386
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,129
What's the matter, Officer Takagi?

387
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,229
You look kind of pale.

388
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,229
Are you eating right?

389
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:17,029
Let's hurry up and start questioning the people

390
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,829
about the post office robbery.

391
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,129
It seems he's still hasn't recovered

392
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,829
from the last time he was brushed off.

393
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,329
Come now, Ai.

394
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,129
Why do you know about it?

395
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:30,029
Hey, Takagi! How is it?

396
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,729
If you're not feeling up to it,

397
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,929
I can take over questioning for you!

398
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,129
Oh, no, well...

399
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:37,329
Hey! Takagi, your shoulder sure is stiff!

400
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,029
Takagi! Want some coffee?

401
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,829
If you're hungry, there are rice crackers, Takagi!

402
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,629
-Here... -Thank you.

403
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,130
Amazing! Officer Takagi's really popular, isn't he?

404
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,530
Well, it's not quite right...

405
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,829
"Next Episode" -But when we got there,

406
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,029
the person was really surprised and looked pale!

407
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,729
The person couldn't have be acting!

408
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:12,729
I wonder if that story is true...

409
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,530
It's pretty unbelievable, isn't it?

410
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,229
A mistake?

411
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,329
I figured out who the culprit is!

412
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,630
-What? -What?

413
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,729
Next Conan,

414
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,830
"The Victim Returns"
