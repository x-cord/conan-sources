1
00:00:01,261 --> 00:00:04,670
Sera suspects that Haibara may have been turned into a child

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,831
and is trying to get close to her.

3
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:09,760
In order to dodge her investigation,

4
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:17,371
we accepted Professor Agasa's invitation to visit an antique appraiser along with Subaru-san.

5
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:20,011
However...

6
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:22,910
Nishitsu-san.

7
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:24,721
Where are you, Nishitsu-san?

8
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,461
Nishitsu-san.

9
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:28,741
Nishitsu-san?

10
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:30,311
What happened?

11
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:32,271
Who did this to you?

12
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:41,540
Th-This... This is the real tray...

13
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,161
Wh-What's this?

14
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:44,811
A crane design?

15
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:47,541
Must be the black lacquer tray he mentioned.

16
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:52,961
In any case, we need to call an ambulance and the police.

17
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,461
Oh, no. My phone is in my car.

18
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:58,971
Nishitsu-san, wait here. I'll be right back.

19
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,741
That's the room.

20
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:28,161
What's this?

21
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:33,301
It's no use. He's dead.

22
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,531
Hey, Conan-kun.

23
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:39,230
I don't see a tray anywhere.

24
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:39,881
What?

25
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:42,421
What's going on here?

26
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,381
You're making quite a lot of noise.

27
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:51,710
Who are you?

28
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:56,360
You're not scoundrels here to steal my tray, are you?

29
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:58,401
If you're outsiders, could you please leave?

30
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:05,661
Later, the police arrived, and in another room,

31
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:11,351
they questioned the three people who were inside the house when the murder occurred.

32
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:14,270
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

33
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:16,900
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

34
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:20,420
Behind the scenes of the case, the Akai family's secrets intertwine!

35
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:22,110
Always determining the one truth

36
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:23,990
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

37
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:26,611
his name is Detective Conan!

38
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:11,761
"The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden, Part Two!"

39
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,161
Is there nobody else in this house?

40
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:21,791
Normally the son and his wife live here,

41
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:25,520
but they're currently on vacation.

42
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:26,461
Huh.

43
00:04:26,462 --> 00:04:27,801
I see.

44
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,350
In other words, excluding the three of us in the entryway,

45
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:33,901
at the time of the murder, the people in this house were

46
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:39,111
Tojima Motoyuki-san who got lost on his way back from the bathroom,

47
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:43,931
Chono Kinji-san who was reading books on antiques in the study,

48
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:50,491
and Sakamaki Suzue-san who was alone in this reception room.

49
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,950
The three of you could move freely throughout the house.

50
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:58,001
Any one of you could've stabbed Nishitsu-san to death with a spear.

51
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:08,330
We'll know immediately who the culprit is.

52
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:13,090
After all, I'm sure they put the real black lacquer tray inside their own box.

53
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:14,141
You're right.

54
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:20,500
Once an appraiser examines the trays inside those three boxes,

55
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:23,530
it'll be clear as day who the culprit is.

56
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,751
You really are grown up, aren't you?

57
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:32,951
"Clear as day" is an expression used to describe something very easy to see or understand.

58
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:37,401
It's extremely unusual for a first-year grade school student to use that expression.

59
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:41,291
How old are you actually?

60
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:48,040
You took the same thing as Conan-kun, didn't you?

61
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,741
Is it that strange?

62
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:51,551
What?

63
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:55,520
In this day and age, even grade school students walk around with smartphones.

64
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,311
They can immediately look up any terms they see or hear on TV or in books.

65
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:03,790
On top of that, the professor often uses complicated language.

66
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:07,490
It wouldn't be that odd if his roommate picked up some of his language.

67
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,071
I suppose not.

68
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:18,470
In that case, get another appraiser to come here.

69
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:19,321
Yes, sir.

70
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:21,411
Hey, wait.

71
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:26,800
Did the culprit really put the real tray inside their own box?

72
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:31,341
Maybe they simply put it back inside the empty box.

73
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:36,591
Y-Yes, that's right, in order to make it seem like the culprit was after the black lacquer tray.

74
00:06:36,851 --> 00:06:41,350
Maybe this was the work of some other person who held a grudge against him.

75
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:46,351
Yeah. For example, maybe the tray they brought received harsh criticism.

76
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:53,611
In any case, I won't stand for being named the culprit just because the real tray is in my box.

77
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:58,440
Either way, we can't not call an appraiser.

78
00:06:58,441 --> 00:07:06,511
Getting a noted appraiser to come here would probably take some time.

79
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,171
Hey, Professor.

80
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:14,160
Didn't you say Nishitsu-san said the tray in front of him was the real tray?

81
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:15,761
Y-Yeah...

82
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,481
He touched the tray with his bloody...

83
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:19,891
That's right.

84
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:25,670
Nishitsu-san's bloody fingerprints are on the back of the real tray.

85
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:26,891
Really?

86
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:31,401
Yes, when I found Nishitsu-san and ran to his side...

87
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:33,521
Who did this to you?

88
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:41,241
Th-This... This is the real tray...

89
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:47,211
You should be able to identify the culprit if you turn over those three trays.

90
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:52,780
In that case, everyone, so nobody tries to make excuses later,

91
00:07:52,781 --> 00:07:55,491
could you all sit behind your own box?

92
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:06,391
Let's begin by checking the back of the tray inside Tojima-san's box.

93
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:12,791
Naturally, whoever owns the bloody tray will become our prime suspect.

94
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:15,640
There's blood on this.

95
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:16,531
What?

96
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:19,990
I see. So you're the culprit.

97
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:22,411
N-No! It wasn't me!

98
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:27,411
Now, now. Just to be sure, let's look at the other two trays.

99
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:32,791
Whoa, whoa.

100
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:36,331
There's blood on the backs of all three trays.

101
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:39,220
What's going on here?

102
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:40,630
Well, uh...

103
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:45,101
The culprit probably noticed the blood on the back of the tray,

104
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:50,520
and used quick thinking to put the same bloody mark on the other two trays.

105
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:53,861
So we wouldn't know which one is the real tray.

106
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:57,250
Which means we'll have to call an appraiser after all.

107
00:08:57,251 --> 00:09:02,361
Agasa-san, is there anything else that would help us identify the real tray?

108
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:06,241
I'm not so sure.

109
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:13,640
Come to think of it, when I flipped the bloody tray over sideways,

110
00:09:13,641 --> 00:09:17,421
the crane's beak was right at the same spot as the blood.

111
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:24,080
If you turn them over sideways, the beak's position will tell us which one is the real tray.

112
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:29,981
To make things clearer, let's turn the trays so the blood is at the top.

113
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:35,491
When we turn them over sideways, whichever tray's crane's beak is pointing straight up is...

114
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:43,480
None of the beaks are pointing straight up.

115
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:45,491
That's impossible.

116
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:46,860
Come on.

117
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:49,620
Didn't you say this would identify the culprit?

118
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:51,130
This is nonsense.

119
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:52,121
Identify?

120
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:57,861
Come to think of it, how did you identify me?

121
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:06,580
You spoke to me while I was watching the professor's house from behind the gate.

122
00:10:06,581 --> 00:10:07,681
Hey, you.

123
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:13,141
If you're interested in someone inside, why don't you come with me?

124
00:10:13,691 --> 00:10:17,520
And you answered Conan-kun's question in this way...

125
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:21,300
More importantly, did you see anyone at the gate?

126
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:23,031
Yes, I did.

127
00:10:23,241 --> 00:10:26,181
There was a girl wearing a motorcycle helmet.

128
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:32,661
How did you know I was a girl?

129
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:40,171
Normally you'd assume someone dressed like this wearing a motorcycle helmet would be a man.

130
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:43,171
What about me seemed feminine to you?

131
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:50,431
You don't actually know who I am, do you?

132
00:10:58,161 --> 00:11:01,611
How did you know I was a woman?

133
00:11:05,921 --> 00:11:07,111
It was your bottom.

134
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:07,911
What?

135
00:11:09,581 --> 00:11:10,720
My b-bot...?

136
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:15,871
Yes, your uniquely feminine hips make it quite obvious.

137
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:21,921
I didn't think it was necessary to say out loud.

138
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:23,880
I see.

139
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:26,021
My butt, huh?

140
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:35,090
Isn't Sera your younger sister?

141
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:37,191
You know everything, don't you?

142
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:39,481
Then why don't you tell her?

143
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:45,151
Because I want to keep my sister out of this as much as possible.

144
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:54,321
Anyway, I can't believe it's been 17 years.

145
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:59,041
Why?

146
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:02,250
Why do I have to go to Japan?

147
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:05,381
I already have so many friends in England!

148
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:10,391
Shukichi, have you forgotten what Father told us in his message?

149
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:15,771
We're going to hide the fact that we're English and live in Japan.

150
00:12:16,161 --> 00:12:20,451
But I didn't get to say goodbye to my friends.

151
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:22,531
Shukichi.

152
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:26,550
Do you remember Father's friend Haneda-san?

153
00:12:26,551 --> 00:12:27,361
Yeah.

154
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:30,490
Remember his son Koji?

155
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:33,781
Oh, yeah. The guy who's good at that shogi game.

156
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:38,610
Apparently Koji-san died a mysterious death in the United States.

157
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:44,791
Father traveled there because Haneda-san asked him to uncover the truth.

158
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:48,630
He discovered a vile organization is involved,

159
00:12:48,631 --> 00:12:51,761
so we're seeking refuge in Japan, just to be safe.

160
00:12:54,951 --> 00:12:58,811
It's all right, though. He's a very strong person.

161
00:12:59,331 --> 00:13:04,061
He'll round up those evil people and return to us right away.

162
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:08,321
He has two adorable sons waiting for him, and besides,

163
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:11,181
I'm sure he'll want to meet her, too.

164
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,071
Her, who?

165
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:18,121
Your younger sister.

166
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,581
Come on, Ai-chan.

167
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:26,051
What are you talking about?

168
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:32,091
She's grown so much.

169
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:36,101
I see. I understand.

170
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:37,591
Bye.

171
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:41,920
Well? Were you able to get an appraiser?

172
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,520
Apparently they can't come until tomorrow.

173
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:49,531
What? You mean every appraiser in Tokyo?

174
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:50,890
Yes.

175
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:54,950
All the noted appraisers are either on business trips to other prefectures or overseas,

176
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:57,580
or else they're not feeling well.

177
00:13:57,581 --> 00:14:00,660
Whoa, whoa. Surely you don't mean...

178
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:04,080
You don't expect us to stay here until tomorrow, do you?

179
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:05,291
Uh, well...

180
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,060
Give me a break.

181
00:14:08,061 --> 00:14:13,341
I'm supposed to meet a buyer for this tray tonight.

182
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:15,780
They're visiting from overseas.

183
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:18,680
If I miss tonight, I don't know when I'll be able to see them next.

184
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:20,480
I'm in the same boat.

185
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:26,050
Tonight is the 40th anniversary party for the real estate company I founded.

186
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:31,620
How could I attend such a monumental event without this tray?

187
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:37,180
My speech includes an anecdote about the difficult time I had acquiring this.

188
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:40,670
And I need to leave in three hours.

189
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:48,041
I hired a cameraman and studio to shoot photos for the museum's reopening pamphlet.

190
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:54,610
Naturally, the photos will be of this tray, so I'll be taking mine with me when the time comes.

191
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:56,091
No, wait.

192
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:59,950
That tray is evidence in a murder case.

193
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:04,060
The police will be holding on to it for a while.

194
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:05,731
And the other trays, too.

195
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:10,080
You can't be serious. What about tonight's party?

196
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:12,360
What about my buyer?

197
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,531
Please calm down.

198
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:19,170
We can't allow a murderer to walk free.

199
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:21,031
We'd appreciate your cooperation.

200
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:25,681
Inspector Megure.

201
00:15:25,682 --> 00:15:26,940
What is it?

202
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:30,541
Forensics found this next to the body.

203
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:33,551
It seems to be a hearing aid.

204
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:36,210
A hearing aid?

205
00:15:36,211 --> 00:15:41,270
Ah, that's the "Deaf Angel" I invented.

206
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:43,851
"Deaf?"

207
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:48,351
It's a wireless hearing aid the late Nishitsu-san bought from me.

208
00:15:48,731 --> 00:15:55,260
It turns the voices and sounds around you into the gentle whispers of an angel.

209
00:15:55,261 --> 00:16:01,911
Which means it probably fell out of his ear when the culprit struck the victim.

210
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:06,850
Do you recognize this?

211
00:16:06,851 --> 00:16:08,251
Yes.

212
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:12,160
I did notice that he had something in his ear.

213
00:16:12,161 --> 00:16:15,390
I didn't realize it was a hearing aid.

214
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,631
He spoke with us just fine.

215
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:22,540
Of course he did. My inventions work great.

216
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,311
Excuse me, Agasa-san. Could I talk to you?

217
00:16:26,171 --> 00:16:27,410
What is it?

218
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:36,261
The victim's phone received a message from you about 20 minutes before the murder.

219
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:38,151
Does that sound familiar?

220
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:41,951
Yes, I sent him a message telling him we were on our way.

221
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,951
For some reason it looks like that message was never opened.

222
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:50,270
The phone was set to play notification sounds, though.

223
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:52,380
I don't know what to tell you.

224
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:56,841
It was probably already malfunctioning by then.

225
00:16:58,201 --> 00:17:00,360
It's what you'd expect from a "Deaf Angel."

226
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:03,090
What a fitting name for the device.

227
00:17:03,091 --> 00:17:05,430
I can't hear you.

228
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:07,021
Fitting?

229
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:10,981
If you ask me, your behavior is hardly fitting for a child.

230
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:17,111
Come on, Ai-chan. Tell me about the drug.

231
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:23,081
You turn back into an adult periodically like Conan-kun, right?

232
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:28,241
If you've got it, could you share some with me?

233
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:33,251
That drug that restores the flow of time.

234
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:40,011
"Restore the flow of time?" What do you mean by that?

235
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:41,011
What?

236
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:45,761
"Restore" implies there's something wrong with the current situation.

237
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:50,270
Or perhaps there's something wrong with someone other than you.

238
00:17:50,271 --> 00:17:52,191
It's none of your business!

239
00:17:53,591 --> 00:17:54,981
No way. He vanished?

240
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:55,771
Huh?

241
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:00,531
That was a 50-50.

242
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:09,411
It's my fault for touching a nerve, but you're also at fault for suddenly kicking me.

243
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:13,580
Perhaps my advice is unwelcome,

244
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:21,251
but if you want to be more feminine, perhaps you should behave less violently.

245
00:18:22,421 --> 00:18:26,301
I'll be fine. I don't have to do anything to become more feminine.

246
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:32,061
My mom's chest used to be huge.

247
00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:33,561
"Used to be?"

248
00:18:33,971 --> 00:18:38,800
Does that mean your mother passed away?

249
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:42,071
No, it's not like that, but...

250
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:43,491
But?

251
00:18:46,221 --> 00:18:49,911
Seriously, it's none of your business.

252
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:04,461
I see. Akai-san wants to confirm his mother's well-being.

253
00:19:05,051 --> 00:19:12,091
Which means that middle-school-aged girl is Sera and Akai-san's mother.

254
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:18,441
She's that Mary woman I met at the beach a long time ago.

255
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:22,321
Since Sera keeps asking about the drug, then as I thought,

256
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:30,201
that must mean she was shrunk after being forced to take APTX 4869, too.

257
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:36,081
But who is she? Why did she take the drug?

258
00:19:36,621 --> 00:19:39,581
All I know is that she has exceptional deductive skills,

259
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:42,961
Sleep is a biological function

260
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:47,190
of the periodically repeated loss of consciousness.

261
00:19:47,191 --> 00:19:47,786
In other words,

262
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,081
The old man's voice...

263
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:51,601
it's practically impossible for a person to speak while sleeping.

264
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:53,801
A smartphone behind his neck?

265
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,066
Naturally, sleep talking is an exception.

266
00:19:55,091 --> 00:19:56,601
Where did that come from?

267
00:19:56,921 --> 00:20:00,140
The words I'm speaking now must sound like

268
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:03,751
nonsensical sleep talking to you.

269
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:09,350
But since they are the words of the detective who has solved this ridiculous case,

270
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:11,121
I ask that you listen.

271
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:14,621
is an excellent martial artist,

272
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:16,941
What's it doing there?

273
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:21,791
I should take one of under the balcony, too.

274
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:28,801
I-Is he dead?

275
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:34,761
No, they struck his vitals and knocked him unconscious

276
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:37,801
during the seconds it took for me to run here.

277
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:41,311
They're as quick as a secret service agent.

278
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:46,261
It must've been the sister out of territory.

279
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,971
and is English.

280
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:55,791
After all, you're the apprentice of my country's greatest detective.

281
00:20:58,031 --> 00:21:00,141
Y-Your country?

282
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,920
You're English?

283
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:06,051
Yeah, although I'm an American now.

284
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:08,551
England?

285
00:21:19,281 --> 00:21:25,191
No way! Does "sister out of territory" actually mean...?

286
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:31,361
Hey, you.

287
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:36,831
Making us stay here won't get you anywhere.

288
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:38,840
B-But...

289
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm leaving.

290
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:42,751
You can't leave.

291
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:46,120
Judging by the situation,

292
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:54,011
it's likely that one of you struck Nishitsu-san the appraiser on the head with a spear,

293
00:21:54,741 --> 00:21:58,261
and used that same spear to stab him in the back and kill him.

294
00:21:58,461 --> 00:22:01,141
We'd like you to stay a little longer.

295
00:22:02,961 --> 00:22:05,151
How much longer?

296
00:22:05,431 --> 00:22:10,901
How are you going to find the culprit when none of the appraisers can make it here?

297
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:16,040
We're currently reaching out to appraisers from other prefectures.

298
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,411
If you could wait just a little longer...

299
00:23:45,331 --> 00:23:51,501
When you flipped over the tray, what was the orientation of the crane carved onto the front?

300
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:55,620
We can put our trays back in our boxes and leave now, right?

301
00:23:55,621 --> 00:23:58,591
You can finish questioning us another day.

302
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:04,601
What if I told you I could tell the real tray apart from the fakes without an appraiser?

303
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:08,290
I know who had the real tray.

304
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,101
What?

305
00:24:09,601 --> 00:24:14,101
The next episode of Conan is "The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden, Part Three!"
