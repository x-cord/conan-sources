1
00:00:02,492 --> 00:00:04,291
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:05,991
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:07,791
On the floor below the detective agency is Cafe Poirot.

4
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:09,491
A forgotten cell phone invites a case.

5
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:11,191
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,192 --> 00:00:12,991
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,992 --> 00:00:15,292
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,674 --> 00:02:00,174
My name's Kogoro Mouri.

9
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:02,573
I run a detective business that fights against

10
00:02:02,574 --> 00:02:05,873
the darkness of society called crime.

11
00:02:05,874 --> 00:02:08,773
Conan, sonny, let's go have breakfast!

12
00:02:08,774 --> 00:02:10,373
Conan, sonny?

13
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:12,774
"Cafe Poirot" -Hello!

14
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:16,174
Two morning sets, please.

15
00:02:17,274 --> 00:02:18,373
Although it's a daily repetition of investigating

16
00:02:18,374 --> 00:02:20,873
extra-marital affairs and searching for people...

17
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:24,773
There are times when I'm involved in bloody cases.

18
00:02:24,774 --> 00:02:28,673
The many sad incidents that are in the papers everyday.

19
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:30,573
Motives vary from revenge, money matters,

20
00:02:30,574 --> 00:02:33,174
complications in love affairs and so on forth.

21
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:37,473
It sure is a sick world.

22
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:39,673
I come here often when I get sick and tired

23
00:02:39,674 --> 00:02:43,173
of all the bonds involved in the detective business.

24
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:44,673
Thank you for waiting.

25
00:02:44,674 --> 00:02:49,173
Yes, this cup of warm coffee

26
00:02:49,174 --> 00:02:50,573
is indeed what relieves my heart

27
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:53,274
that is exhausted from all bonds I have in life.

28
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:57,174
Hot!

29
00:02:58,274 --> 00:03:01,274
What's wrong with him?

30
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:08,474
"Forgotten Cell Phone (Part 1)"

31
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:14,373
How unusual of you to come here from morning?

32
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:17,873
Are you going to be meeting a client today?

33
00:03:17,874 --> 00:03:21,673
No, no, Ran's gone to Karate Club Camp from yesterday.

34
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:23,474
So, we're having a late breakfast.

35
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:26,873
Besides, today is Sunday.

36
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,473
I should take a break from the heap of cases

37
00:03:30,474 --> 00:03:32,573
that come avalanching in everyday.

38
00:03:32,574 --> 00:03:34,374
People!

39
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:36,473
Good morning!

40
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:39,573
I'm Shuhei Baisho! Shuhei Baisho here!

41
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:41,673
I will do whatever is in my power

42
00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:44,373
and work for you with my entire heart and soul!

43
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:45,773
With your valuable ballot,

44
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:47,073
I Shuhei Baisho will work with you

45
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:49,073
to create a quiet town!

46
00:03:49,074 --> 00:03:51,473
Work?

47
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:55,973
-Yes! Mouri Detective Agency. -Wake up, Hiroshi.

48
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:58,073
Come on, it's already 8:00 in the morning.

49
00:03:58,074 --> 00:04:01,273
You're going to get me, Yuka, in trouble

50
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,874
if you don't get up.

51
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:06,573
You're the one who's still groggy and not awake!

52
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:08,473
Check the number before you make the call!

53
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:09,673
Darn!

54
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:12,974
Excuse me, but could it be that...

55
00:04:14,174 --> 00:04:16,774
business is slow?

56
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,473
Yes, yes.

57
00:04:19,474 --> 00:04:22,174
We didn't get any calls all this week.

58
00:04:22,874 --> 00:04:25,073
The thing is...

59
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:26,673
But...

60
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:28,473
I wonder if it's okay to ask a detective

61
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:30,573
to do something like this.

62
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:32,774
Is something troubling you, Azusa?

63
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,573
A strange thing was forgotten here

64
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:39,973
and I was wondering if you could locate its owner,

65
00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:42,573
who is a customer of our shop.

66
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,373
Oh, a search for somebody.

67
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:47,874
What is it? That strange thing that was forgotten.

68
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,473
It's this.

69
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:54,374
A cell phone?

70
00:04:55,974 --> 00:04:58,873
It looks to be an ordinary cell phone but...

71
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:01,473
The pattern is pretty odd.

72
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:03,573
Other than that, it isn't really all that strange.

73
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:05,973
If the person who forgot this cell phone

74
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:07,373
is really looking for it,

75
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,073
I'm sure that person will call.

76
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:11,573
Well, someone did call three times.

77
00:05:11,574 --> 00:05:12,673
Three times?

78
00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:15,273
Yup, when I answered the phone,

79
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,773
this is what the first person said...

80
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:21,773
"Oh? I'm sorry, I seem to have made a mistake."

81
00:05:21,774 --> 00:05:23,174
A mistake?

82
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:26,173
What about the second time?

83
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:27,873
The second time this is what the person said.

84
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:31,473
"That's strange, did it ring?"

85
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:34,073
It seemed like someone else was beside that person.

86
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:36,273
Right after saying so, the phone was cut again.

87
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:38,373
Oh! I'm sure that the person

88
00:05:38,374 --> 00:05:41,173
was looking for the cell phone by listening for it.

89
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,273
But, since he was looking in the wrong place,

90
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:45,473
he could have thought that

91
00:05:45,474 --> 00:05:47,873
he had dialed the wrong number!

92
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:50,873
But, it didn't sound like this person

93
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:54,074
was the owner of this cell phone.

94
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:57,673
-Why not? -Because with the third call,

95
00:05:57,674 --> 00:06:00,973
that person's tone of voice suddenly changed and...

96
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:03,473
"Hey, you! I'll bet you're his broad?"

97
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:05,073
Get him on the line!

98
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:07,873
He shouted saying, "I'm going to kill you!"

99
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:10,673
-Kill? -Kill you?

100
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:12,173
And?

101
00:06:12,174 --> 00:06:14,673
What did you tell him, Azusa?

102
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,373
Well...

103
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:19,073
I hope you explained the circumstances to him. Did you?

104
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:20,573
I was scared...

105
00:06:20,574 --> 00:06:23,173
so I switched the phone off.

106
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,873
Oh, I see.

107
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:27,273
Please show me the cell phone!

108
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:30,573
I told the master about it the following day, and was scolded.

109
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:33,073
So I kept the phone switched on all day since then,

110
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:35,874
but the phone hasn't rung so far.

111
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:40,073
Sure enough.

112
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:42,673
No wonder nobody's calling back on this cell phone.

113
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:43,873
Why do you say that?

114
00:06:43,874 --> 00:06:46,574
Because this phone isn't working!

115
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:51,673
See! Even if I try to make a call,

116
00:06:51,674 --> 00:06:53,873
I get the busy signal right away, right?

117
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:54,973
True.

118
00:06:54,974 --> 00:06:57,973
I get it! The owner of this cell phone

119
00:06:57,974 --> 00:06:59,173
probably couldn't pay his phone bill

120
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:01,073
and so his phone was cut off!

121
00:07:01,074 --> 00:07:05,373
Which means the rude one who called was a money collector!

122
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:08,073
In other words, he called the owner of the phone

123
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:09,873
thinking he was living alone, but a woman answered

124
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:12,373
so thinking he made a mistake, he hung up.

125
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:15,873
He checked the number and called back.

126
00:07:15,874 --> 00:07:19,273
But, he probably blew his top at the third call!

127
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:22,873
Then, why did the one who called the second time say,

128
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:25,274
"Did it ring?"

129
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:28,473
It's most likely that

130
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:29,973
when the collector went to the home

131
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:31,173
of the owner of this cell phone

132
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:33,073
and called him from in front of the apartment,

133
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:35,373
he didn't hear any sound from inside the apartment

134
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:36,873
so he thought it was odd.

135
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:39,973
Do you remember what kind of person

136
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:42,573
who forgot this cell phone was?

137
00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:45,573
He came here a little after noon.

138
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:46,574
He was a chubby man wearing glasses

139
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:48,973
and his hair was parted on the side.

140
00:07:48,974 --> 00:07:53,073
He was eating and touching that flashy cell phone all the while

141
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:54,973
so I remember him very well.

142
00:07:54,974 --> 00:08:00,373
The phone rang for the first time about an hour after he left.

143
00:08:00,374 --> 00:08:03,773
The second call came right after the first

144
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:07,074
and the third call came in about 30 minutes later.

145
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:12,473
The number of the one who called was not displayed.

146
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:14,373
On top of that, the record of calls made before that,

147
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:17,373
as well as the call received records are not saved at all.

148
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:21,474
Oh, there were a lot of names and numbers left on it.

149
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:25,173
Then, why don't you try calling those numbers?

150
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:27,073
Well, I sort of did.

151
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,373
They all seem to have been random numbers.

152
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:31,473
Besides,

153
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:33,274
the names all seemed to be fake too.

154
00:08:35,374 --> 00:08:37,573
It's true and strange that all the names

155
00:08:37,574 --> 00:08:39,873
are in Katakana characters.

156
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:42,773
As to the phone numbers...

157
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:44,673
1022?

158
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:46,873
I see, this is strange.

159
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:51,573
There are no 10 digit numbers that start with the number 1.

160
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:55,473
What's this black mark on the side of the names?

161
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:57,473
There are some names with black marks beside them

162
00:08:57,474 --> 00:08:59,674
and some without!

163
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:06,573
True, there are marks on some and none on others.

164
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:08,573
Don't tell me that that all these numbers

165
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:11,473
are all some kind of code?

166
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:13,573
How annoying!

167
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:14,973
Darn!

168
00:09:14,974 --> 00:09:18,773
Where was this cell phone placed when it was forgotten?

169
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:21,374
Well...

170
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:24,873
Over there.

171
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:29,473
Under the sofa where you're sitting right now, Mr. Mouri.

172
00:09:29,474 --> 00:09:31,573
He probably dropped it accidentally

173
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:33,073
when he tried to put it in his pocket.

174
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:36,273
Without realizing he dropped it,

175
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:37,973
he kicked the cell phone with his foot.

176
00:09:37,974 --> 00:09:40,974
That's how think it got there but...

177
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:44,073
Like I just explained,

178
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:46,273
I found the cell phone right after

179
00:09:46,274 --> 00:09:48,774
the man called the first time.

180
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,973
-The antenna was sticking out besides! -What?

181
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:59,473
Was the cell phone folded in two like this back then?

182
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,773
Yup.

183
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:02,373
That's why I thought he dropped it

184
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:04,473
when he tried to put it in his pocket.

185
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:06,173
Don't you think it's odd?

186
00:10:06,174 --> 00:10:07,473
Huh? Why is that so?

187
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:11,573
Because if he folded the cell phone to put into his pocket,

188
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:15,273
don't you think he'd naturally push the antenna back in too?

189
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:19,473
Right! Because you don't want the antenna to break!

190
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:21,173
He probably didn't do so

191
00:10:21,174 --> 00:10:23,173
because he's either a very sloppy guy.

192
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:26,273
Or he did so and deliberately hid it,

193
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:29,573
wanting someone to find it when it rang.

194
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:32,873
What do you think, Pops?

195
00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:37,173
Yeah, I was just about to say so.

196
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:40,973
But if so, for whatever reason...

197
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:45,273
You can't figure out who the owner is after all.

198
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:47,973
If it's the owner of this cell phone, I know who it is.

199
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:50,073
But how?

200
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:53,573
Azusa, every cell phone

201
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:58,273
has seal with its product number written on it.

202
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:02,373
If we give that number to the manufacturer,

203
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:04,173
then find out where the cell phone was bought,

204
00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:06,073
explain the circumstances to the shop,

205
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:09,973
we can get the name of the owner of the cell phone!

206
00:11:09,974 --> 00:11:12,673
Wow!

207
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:15,073
You take off the back cover of the cell phone.

208
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,474
And under the place where the battery is removed...

209
00:11:19,474 --> 00:11:22,073
-Not inside. -The seal...

210
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:24,473
-The seal is peeled off! -Why?

211
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:27,673
Can you tell us more in detail about the customer

212
00:11:27,674 --> 00:11:29,973
who forgot this cell phone?

213
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:32,073
More in detail?

214
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:34,773
Even the slightest detail, even if it seems trivial.

215
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:38,274
-Anything! -Well...

216
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:43,673
Come to think of it, that customer

217
00:11:43,674 --> 00:11:46,173
ordered fried noodles, spaghetti, fruit parfait,

218
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:48,273
tomato juice and Caesar's salad

219
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,373
and paid exactly 3,000 yen!

220
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:53,973
3,000 yen?

221
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:56,673
Well, ordering the 5 items he ordered is the only way

222
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,573
to come up with a total of exactly 3,000 yen,

223
00:11:58,574 --> 00:12:01,774
so I was sort of impressed!

224
00:12:02,774 --> 00:12:05,773
Since Conan said that any trivial detail would do,

225
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:08,073
-I thought I'd mention it. -But...

226
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:12,673
the guy sure is a big eater, eating 5 items from noon.

227
00:12:12,674 --> 00:12:15,173
Right, he seemed to be on the job and yet

228
00:12:15,174 --> 00:12:17,573
I thought to myself he sure can eat.

229
00:12:17,574 --> 00:12:19,873
On the job?

230
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:23,773
Because he asked for a receipt.

231
00:12:23,774 --> 00:12:25,073
Receipt?

232
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:27,673
What the name on it?

233
00:12:27,674 --> 00:12:29,773
Of course, "Customer".

234
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:31,274
I guess so.

235
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:37,473
Thank you so much! I'll be waiting for your ballot for me!

236
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:41,674
I will do my best for you all as I have been doing so far!

237
00:12:43,774 --> 00:12:48,773
But if he was eating alone and still wanted a receipt,

238
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:50,773
the probability of him being an ordinary office worker

239
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:52,074
becomes quite unlikely.

240
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:56,374
If so then, what on earth...

241
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,998
He is most probably an office worker on a business trip

242
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:05,998
or a man who owns his own business.

243
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:10,698
He could be a person with that kind of habit.

244
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:13,998
If so, maybe he's a journalist or a detective.

245
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:17,198
Even the police ask for receipts.

246
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:21,498
Police officers in police boxes ask for receipts for meals they have?

247
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:23,599
Oh, no.

248
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:25,699
Hello...

249
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:29,698
That only goes for police detectives.

250
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:31,198
I hope you don't mind me joining you.

251
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:33,698
Hello.

252
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:35,798
When they go asking around or on a stake out,

253
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,198
or have to follow the suspect,

254
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:39,398
police detectives ask for receipts for transportation fee

255
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,898
and food and drinks needed during the investigation.

256
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:45,898
But, we officers in uniforms rarely use investigation fee.

257
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,498
Oh, you're the one who's always hanging around with Officer Takagi.

258
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:51,398
What brings you here, Yumi?

259
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,598
What else

260
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:56,998
but to urge Mr. Detective here who takes forever to pay

261
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:58,498
for his parking ticket?

262
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:02,298
Oh, well, I was thinking of going to pay today.

263
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,199
Today is Sunday!

264
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,998
I'm only joking.

265
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:11,798
We're looking for a man.

266
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,299
But this is the only clue we have.

267
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:17,798
Three...

268
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,998
Three thousand yen?

269
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:20,498
Is his by chance

270
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:22,298
wearing glasses and has his hair parted on the side?

271
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:25,698
-A chubby man? -Yes.

272
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,598
Do you know where he is?

273
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,098
Well, sort of.

274
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:30,398
I'm glad!

275
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,898
I can finally give the cell phone back to its owner.

276
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,698
What do you mean give back?

277
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:38,798
That man forgot his cell phone here.

278
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,399
I also got strange calls too so I was really concerned.

279
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:46,598
But, you can't return it to him.

280
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:49,598
Because he passed away the night before last.

281
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,598
Passed away?

282
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:54,598
Oh, no.

283
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:57,198
Don't tell me he was killed?

284
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,398
No!

285
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,298
He was run over by a truck at the 3-chome intersection.

286
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:03,698
A car accident?

287
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:09,898
I remember. They aired that accident on the news.

288
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,998
Yes. The accident occurred

289
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:14,198
the day before yesterday just before 14:00.

290
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:16,298
He was taken to the hospital immediately,

291
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:17,798
but he didn't make it.

292
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:20,198
He passed away that night.

293
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:24,998
That's why we're investigating trying to identify who he is.

294
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:26,598
Wait a minute.

295
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:29,998
Don't tell me this was a hit-and-run case?

296
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:32,498
No.

297
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:36,298
The driver of the truck that hit the man didn't flee,

298
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,198
nor was he under the influence of alcohol.

299
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,798
According to testimony by the witness, the man

300
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:46,799
seems to have suddenly come running out from behind a parked car.

301
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:51,498
Which means this excludes the possibility of homicide.

302
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:53,498
Don't tell me? Could it have been suicide!

303
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:55,498
That's very unlikely,

304
00:15:55,499 --> 00:15:57,998
because he seems to have asked for directions

305
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,098
at the convenience store near the accident site before he was hit.

306
00:16:01,099 --> 00:16:02,898
He seems to have been in a great big rush, and asked,

307
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:06,798
"Do you know where a shop called Poirot is?"

308
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,798
If he was planning to kill himself,

309
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,698
why would he need to ask about the location

310
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:12,598
of a shop that is 2km away?

311
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:13,698
True.

312
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:15,998
But, I kind of have an idea

313
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:18,498
why that person rushed out into the street.

314
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:21,898
Yeah. In other words, the man wanted to go back to the shop

315
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,498
to retrieve the cell phone he had forgotten there,

316
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:26,298
and was run over by the truck.

317
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:28,498
No, wrong.

318
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:31,498
The dead man's lips are sealed, eh?

319
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:33,598
We're back to zero again.

320
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:36,198
The cell phone was folded in two

321
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:37,698
with it's antenna sticking out

322
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:40,098
and left here as if it were hidden here.

323
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,898
It's like the cell phone was ringing

324
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:44,398
just so that somebody would find it.

325
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:51,098
Those strange names and numbers that were saved in the cell phone.

326
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:52,398
What were they anyway?

327
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,798
What on earth was that man trying to do here?

328
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,498
But two days have already gone by since the accident.

329
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:02,998
It sure took you long to get here.

330
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:04,698
We couldn't help it

331
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:06,398
because he had nothing on him

332
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:08,598
that would give us a clue to who he was.

333
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,098
Oh, right.

334
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:13,298
But he did have all these receipts on him.

335
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,398
All of these here.

336
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:19,598
He sure meticulously kept all these receipts.

337
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,298
Haido. Rizen. Kenbashi.

338
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:25,698
He's gone all around the city.

339
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:26,998
Right.

340
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:29,698
We checked those receipts in order of the dates,

341
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:31,198
and it took us one whole day.

342
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:34,198
But, we finally got here.

343
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:37,698
There were people who remembered him too, however,

344
00:17:37,699 --> 00:17:41,798
nobody knew who he was or where he came from.

345
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,898
But, things as they are, there's a possibility

346
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:48,298
that he was being pursued by loan sharks too.

347
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:49,698
Loan sharks?

348
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:52,298
That's right. There seems to have been a call

349
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:53,998
on the cell phone that he forgot.

350
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:57,098
"If you don't put him on, I'll kill you!",

351
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:59,798
a dangerous sounding man shouted so.

352
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,398
Really?

353
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:06,098
Yes, three times, about an hour after the man left.

354
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:09,798
At any rate, I'd advise you to go check the loan sharks.

355
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,398
If he did borrow money,

356
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:17,798
he would've left his address and name with them too.

357
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,198
Huh? What?

358
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,998
I think you can easily find out without doing something like that.

359
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:26,098
Because the dangerous man who called

360
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:28,998
knows the number of the cell phone, right?

361
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:32,598
If I were him and the phone didn't work,

362
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:35,098
I would give the number to the telephone company

363
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:37,398
and have them check on who the man is!

364
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:38,698
And?

365
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:43,598
So! If you call the phone company, you'll be able to find out

366
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,198
if the dangerous man called.

367
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,498
You fool!

368
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:50,598
Unless you're the police or something, the telephone company

369
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:55,798
would never give out the name and address of anyone!

370
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,799
Understand, Conan, sonny?

371
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:02,398
Oh, but there are times when we panic and rush to make a call,

372
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:05,598
don't you think?

373
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,898
There was a time when I got lost going to my friend's house,

374
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:13,598
and when I tried calling her, her cell phone was switched off.

375
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,198
So, I called the telephone company and asked for her address.

376
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,598
I asked them if they could find my friend's address

377
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,898
-from her cell phone number. -Right, right!

378
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:26,098
Does everybody often do things like that?

379
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,498
And? Did they find her address for you?

380
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:30,798
No, they didn't.

381
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,998
So, I had the police officer at the police box

382
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:34,198
look up her address for me.

383
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:37,298
Well, it's true though, that if the man

384
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:40,298
was in a rush to look for the owner of the phone,

385
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:41,598
he would've tried calling the phone company,

386
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,498
despite knowing that it might not work.

387
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:46,398
Ms. Numata, please look up the number of the phone companies.

388
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:49,798
-Okay! -Let's try each and every one and ask them

389
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,898
whether they got a call or not.

390
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:55,898
It's nice that the police get to ask anything they want.

391
00:19:55,899 --> 00:20:01,998
I guess so! Although it may take a while to get through the red tape.

392
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,898
So long as we have the phone number,

393
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:08,098
it's as if we've already got his address and name!

394
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:09,398
Yes.

395
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:12,698
As long as we kept that e-mail address,

396
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:15,398
we could've gotten to them

397
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:17,898
if we had what the lady had entered on her cell phone.

398
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:19,498
We would've been able to find the hide-out of the boss

399
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:21,398
who controls them all.

400
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:23,998
Yes, from about day before yesterday.

401
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:26,198
Yes, that's right.

402
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:28,898
Yes.

403
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:31,899
I understand, thank you so much.

404
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,898
-How'd it go? -I don't know yet.

405
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:36,798
I've got to wait for them to call me back.

406
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,898
I'll try elsewhere too.

407
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:41,998
Azusa, please serve the customer on table no.1

408
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:43,898
another cup of coffee.

409
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:45,399
Oh, yes, sir.

410
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:50,198
Thank you.

411
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:52,698
No problem. Hang in there and keep up your studies.

412
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:54,599
Oh, I will.

413
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:58,398
Yes, the address, name and phone number.

414
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:01,398
Did you get any calls asking for personal information on a man?

415
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:02,698
Would you like another serving?

416
00:21:02,699 --> 00:21:04,999
-Oh, thank you. -Yes.

417
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,998
Yes, from 2 days ago.

418
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:10,498
Yes, yes.

419
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:12,298
This is on the house.

420
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:13,399
Thank you!

421
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:20,598
-I leave it here. -Oh! Thank you, so very much.

422
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:24,598
Here you go! Orange juice for you, Conan!

423
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,498
Thank you, Azusa!

424
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:30,098
I'm sorry to have got you involved in something like this

425
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:32,498
on a precious Sunday, your day of rest.

426
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:36,798
Will you show me that cell phone that was forgotten one more time?

427
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,099
Sure.

428
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,299
-Here you go. -Thank you.

429
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:44,699
This is funny!

430
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:51,298
The clue that's left on the cell phone.

431
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:54,598
A mysterious 10 digit number that begins with the number "1".

432
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:59,698
And the unexplainable black marks that are beside the names.

433
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:02,198
What on earth do they mean?

434
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:05,298
Thank you for your support! Shuhei Baisho!

435
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:09,398
Will do my best for this town with all my might!

436
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:12,299
Thank you!

437
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:21,898
Yes. Hello.

438
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:25,798
Yes, that's right. Yes! Yes!

439
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,298
Did she get something?

440
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,499
A clue on the man.

441
00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:00,398
Three people called?

442
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:03,498
The telephone numbers that are in this cell phone

443
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:07,098
all start with the same four numbers!

444
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:09,298
All the numbers are similar.

445
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,798
Maybe they all live in the same neighborhood!

446
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,598
This is?

447
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:18,798
Yes, they said that they heard a loud sound on the other side.

448
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,099
A sound loud enough to interrupt conversation.

449
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,898
Next Conan,

450
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:27,699
"Forgotten Cell phone (Part 2)"

451
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:45,498
Next Conan's Hint:

452
00:24:45,499 --> 00:24:47,498
"Big shot."

453
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:48,399
The next episode is part 2.

454
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,598
Don't forget your cell phones, everybody.

455
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:50,499
Take care and don't catch cold.

456
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,599
Brush your teeth, okay?
