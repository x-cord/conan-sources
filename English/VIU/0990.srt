1
00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:06,666
This is the only place left I can turn to.

2
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:09,347
Do you have business with the Mori Detective Agency?

3
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:14,027
It seemed like you were saying something while looking at that window.

4
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:17,456
I guess you could say Detective Mori looks after me.

5
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:19,737
I'm sort of like his apprentice.

6
00:00:20,347 --> 00:00:23,276
He's really a great detective

7
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:27,647
who can solve any case, right?

8
00:00:30,307 --> 00:00:35,047
Yes, even the most difficult cases are a piece of cake once I'm working on them.

9
00:00:35,307 --> 00:00:37,407
You can count on me.

10
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:43,927
I want you to find the culprit responsible for this case.

11
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:47,976
A robbery and murder that happened last week?

12
00:00:47,977 --> 00:00:48,897
If I recall correctly—

13
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:51,466
It happened last Wednesday.

14
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:56,186
Office worker Oide Raita-san, 58 years old, was at his home in Tebai City.

15
00:00:56,187 --> 00:00:59,226
He died when someone struck him on the head,

16
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:02,447
and about 300 thousand yen in cash was stolen.

17
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:06,466
And ten days later, they still haven't found the culprit.

18
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:09,806
Go play somewhere, kid.

19
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:11,506
What's wrong with me staying?

20
00:01:11,507 --> 00:01:14,337
After all, I showed our client in.

21
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,636
Right, Oide-san?

22
00:01:16,637 --> 00:01:18,217
Y-Yeah.

23
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:21,337
Oide? Which means...

24
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:22,617
Yes.

25
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:26,907
I'm Oide Fusaya, the son of the murder victim Oide Raita.

26
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:31,017
My dad...

27
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:55,167
I made him die.

28
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:57,457
You made him die?

29
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:59,187
What does that mean?

30
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:04,696
Find the question that solves the mystery!

31
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:06,846
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

32
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:08,986
A strange request from a victim's family.

33
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:11,156
Who was it that turned the gears of tragedy?

34
00:02:11,157 --> 00:02:12,756
Always determining the one truth

35
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,676
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

36
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:17,017
his name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:02,079
The Automatic Tragedy (Part One)

38
00:04:02,488 --> 00:04:05,198
My father was a very serious person,

39
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,687
but there was a time when I went astray.

40
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:12,148
Because of that, I had a hard time finding a job.

41
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:16,708
And the other day, my older sister got engaged.

42
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:20,718
Her partner is the son of a locally famous wealthy family.

43
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:27,138
My old friends caught wind of it and tried to extort her partner.

44
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,848
I didn't want to trouble my sister,

45
00:04:32,618 --> 00:04:35,108
so I planned to run away from home.

46
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:40,698
The morning of the incident, my mom and sister were planning to go out together,

47
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:42,698
so I decided I'd leave then.

48
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:45,698
Fusaya!

49
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:47,448
Fusaya!

50
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:50,168
We're leaving now!

51
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:53,327
He's probably sleeping again.

52
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:54,328
Seems like it.

53
00:04:56,068 --> 00:05:00,588
My dad works in an office, so when they go out, I'm home alone.

54
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,218
I thought it was the perfect opportunity.

55
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:06,228
But then...

56
00:05:08,718 --> 00:05:11,867
Dad, why are you home so early?

57
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:13,228
Ah, Fusaya.

58
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:16,788
I actually took the day off from work.

59
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:22,398
I thought the two of us could talk about your future.

60
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,698
You did that for me?

61
00:05:25,488 --> 00:05:29,198
I was so grateful, I could've cried, but I'd already made my decision.

62
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:33,748
Were you on your way out, too?

63
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:37,397
I'm leaving this house.

64
00:05:37,398 --> 00:05:38,208
What?

65
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:41,588
I'm moving out of this house!

66
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:45,007
Looking at your face is suffocating!

67
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:47,268
Wh-What?

68
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:49,747
You're unbelievable.

69
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:51,558
Say that again.

70
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:55,057
Do you have any idea how important this time is?

71
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:58,068
Why don't you show a little more consideration for your family?

72
00:05:58,548 --> 00:06:00,987
Are you trying to ruin An's wedding?

73
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:03,657
When are you going to grow up?!

74
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:05,068
Mind your own business!

75
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:12,578
We got into a bit of an argument, but I brushed him off and fled the house.

76
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,467
Fusaya, where are you going?

77
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:15,567
Fusaya!

78
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:19,497
I heard what happened next from my sister and mom.

79
00:06:19,498 --> 00:06:22,588
They returned home that afternoon.

80
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:23,968
We'll split up and look for him.

81
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,978
Later, around 3:30...

82
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:29,008
It's me.

83
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,937
I'm back at the house.

84
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,497
Well? Has anyone seen him?

85
00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:37,448
Apparently he called my sister from the house.

86
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:40,768
That was the last time we heard him speak.

87
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:43,028
Then, at 4:30...

88
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:00,587
My sister and mom discovered the body

89
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:03,948
when they returned home after giving up the search for me.

90
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,808
Normally my dad wouldn't be at home during the evening.

91
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,678
He took the day off for me.

92
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,748
If I hadn't run away, the thief wouldn't have entered the house.

93
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:22,608
I made my dad die.

94
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:26,058
On top of that, I've caused trouble for my sister.

95
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:30,857
Her partner's family says they can't get married while the culprit is still unknown.

96
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:34,058
All the scheduling and arrangements for her wedding have been postponed.

97
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,608
I'm a curse.

98
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:40,078
I turned the gears of misfortune.

99
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:42,437
You shouldn't say that.

100
00:07:42,438 --> 00:07:44,057
He's right.

101
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:45,458
Over there.

102
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:49,218
That's my sister and mom handing out fliers over there.

103
00:07:49,898 --> 00:07:53,757
They're looking for someone who might've seen anyone suspicious that evening.

104
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:57,348
So they're asking for information.

105
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:00,768
Mom, Sis!

106
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:04,268
Fusaya.

107
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:05,817
Are you okay?

108
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,148
Don't push yourself.

109
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:10,127
Looks like they're taking it pretty hard.

110
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:12,758
She probably hasn't been sleeping well.

111
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:20,038
Huh?

112
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:26,447
What's her deal?

113
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:29,167
She was grinning while looking this way.

114
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:32,088
Maybe she knows someone in the Oide family.

115
00:08:32,768 --> 00:08:35,598
I'll go with her.

116
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:38,457
Mori-san, I'm worried. I'm going, too.

117
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,857
Then we'll meet at your home later.

118
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:42,348
Thank you.

119
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,108
I can't believe his mother collapsed, too.

120
00:08:50,158 --> 00:08:52,188
We'd better find the culprit soon.

121
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:55,618
You think the thief turned violent?

122
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:59,197
Yes. Just before 4:30PM that day,

123
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:03,737
a silent call was made to the Oide residence from a nearby public telephone.

124
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:05,628
We believe it was the culprit.

125
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:08,717
They were determining if anyone was home.

126
00:09:08,718 --> 00:09:12,247
Yes. Oide Raita didn't answer the call.

127
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:14,167
The answering machine answered instead.

128
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:17,067
So the culprit thought the house was empty.

129
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:20,018
Yes. Apparently they picked the lock.

130
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:21,678
They picked the lock?

131
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,398
See? This is it.

132
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:27,987
After sneaking into the house,

133
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:30,177
they ran into Oide and turned violent.

134
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:31,668
But, Mister...

135
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:33,328
Kapow.

136
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:37,777
The weapon used to strike Oide's head

137
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,907
was an angular blunt object,

138
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:41,987
but we haven't found it yet.

139
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:44,418
We believe the culprit took it with them.

140
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:46,807
An angular blunt object?

141
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:49,168
I have questions about the weapon, too.

142
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:52,077
Do you have any idea who the culprit is?

143
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:56,238
We're looking into everyone with break-ins via lockpicking on their record, but...

144
00:09:58,148 --> 00:09:59,587
Hey, Mister.

145
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:02,887
Would someone who picks locks to secretly enter empty homes

146
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:06,037
turn violent and kill someone?

147
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:09,347
They probably did it spur of the moment when they ran into the homeowner.

148
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:13,897
Yeah, but it's also odd that someone trying to rob an empty house

149
00:10:13,898 --> 00:10:15,568
brought a weapon and ran away with it.

150
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:17,157
Shut up.

151
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,458
Thinking about that won't—

152
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,478
Mori-san, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

153
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:27,328
My mom's going to be staying at the hospital for two or three days.

154
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:30,367
The Oide family is falling apart.

155
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:31,747
Fusaya-kun.

156
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:32,338
Yes?

157
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:36,588
You mentioned something about the gears of tragedy.

158
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:40,348
It wasn't you who turned them, but the culprit.

159
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:48,268
Ten days may have passed, but it's always worth examining the crime scene.

160
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:52,858
It's likely some kind of clue was left behind.

161
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:55,988
This is the living room where it happened.

162
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,158
All right. Let's find those clues.

163
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,158
Come on out, clues.

164
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:08,788
Come on, clues.

165
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:14,668
I'm taking a break.

166
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:16,768
Hey, Fusaya-san.

167
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,558
What is it?

168
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:23,467
This door looks strangely new compared to the wall.

169
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:27,847
We replaced it about a month ago.

170
00:11:27,848 --> 00:11:28,808
What is it?

171
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:35,727
Lockpicking requires skill, but it's easy to break in when you have a spare key.

172
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,358
Huh?

173
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,588
Fusaya-kun.

174
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:39,927
Y-Yes?

175
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:42,368
Who replaced this door?

176
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:46,118
A nearby contractor called Tebai Engineering.

177
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:48,337
I see.

178
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:54,248
So it was Taira Yasushi-san who was responsible for replacing the door.

179
00:11:54,558 --> 00:12:00,597
And he was out on a job ten days ago last Wednesday evening?

180
00:12:00,598 --> 00:12:02,298
One moment, please.

181
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,308
On that day...

182
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:08,548
Taira took the day off.

183
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,858
I see. Thank you.

184
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:16,157
What? He paid off his rent all at once?

185
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:19,738
Yes, the full amount he owed. 280 thousand yen.

186
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,097
Was that ten days ago?

187
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:25,658
Yes, it was around then.

188
00:12:26,218 --> 00:12:27,158
This is...

189
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:29,128
That must be it.

190
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:32,418
Tebai Engineering

191
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,897
You're Taira Yasushi-san, aren't you?

192
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:36,927
Huh?

193
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:39,347
My name is Mori.

194
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:40,867
I'm a private detective.

195
00:12:40,868 --> 00:12:43,797
What? The famous detective?

196
00:12:43,798 --> 00:12:47,017
I have a few questions for you about the robbery

197
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:50,308
and murder that happened ten days ago.

198
00:12:51,548 --> 00:12:56,197
I'm actually really busy right now.

199
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:56,978
Huh?

200
00:12:56,979 --> 00:12:59,308
That is to say, you know...

201
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:00,738
What?

202
00:13:02,218 --> 00:13:02,608
Hey!

203
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:03,698
You jerk!

204
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:06,788
Stop, damn it!

205
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:10,708
Where did that punk go?

206
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:14,768
Hey.

207
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:15,248
Huh?

208
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:19,548
I think you should tell us everything you know instead of running.

209
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:23,088
The kid's right.

210
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:25,568
This game of tag is over.

211
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:29,308
Now why don't you answer my questions?

212
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:37,372
You used the 300 thousand yen you stole

213
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:40,551
to pay off four month's worth of rent, didn't you?

214
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:44,502
I, uh—I won the lottery.

215
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:48,787
You secretly made a spare key when you replaced the door,

216
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:51,708
and used that to sneak into the Oide residence.

217
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,367
Isn't that right?

218
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:56,097
Well, I—

219
00:13:56,098 --> 00:14:00,858
The scratches on the front door keyhole were a camouflage, weren't they?

220
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:05,608
You did it to make it look like the front door had been picked

221
00:14:05,938 --> 00:14:09,108
and draw attention away from the back door.

222
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:13,157
It's an old trick.

223
00:14:13,158 --> 00:14:14,908
So, where's the weapon?

224
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:16,408
I-I don't know.

225
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:18,498
No, wait. You've got it all wrong.

226
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:20,717
What's wrong?

227
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:21,997
I'll confess.

228
00:14:21,998 --> 00:14:26,298
I'll tell you everything I know if you'll prove my innocence.

229
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:27,418
What?

230
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:32,428
It's exactly like you said, Mori-san.

231
00:14:33,478 --> 00:14:37,768
I needed the money, so I broke into that house that day.

232
00:14:38,228 --> 00:14:41,107
We can't come to the phone at this time.

233
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:42,438
Please leave your message after—

234
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:45,438
I confirmed no one was home,

235
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:49,548
and snuck in through the back door using the spare key I made.

236
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:51,108
Then...

237
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,708
He was snoring in his sleep.

238
00:14:57,888 --> 00:14:59,288
Right on the floor here.

239
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:01,378
I see.

240
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:07,027
So Raita didn't answer the phone because he was fast asleep.

241
00:15:07,028 --> 00:15:12,948
Yeah, but I thought it'd be fine as long as I didn't wake him up.

242
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:22,398
I quietly stole the cash, scratched up the front door keyhole,

243
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:26,468
and then left.

244
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:30,127
What time was that?

245
00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:32,528
Huh? Uh...

246
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:36,037
The time is 4:30.

247
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:39,957
Please be careful as you return to your homes.

248
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,627
It was after 4:30.

249
00:15:41,628 --> 00:15:43,538
There was a notice playing.

250
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:49,797
Oide Raita-san's estimated time of death is also after 4:30.

251
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:52,928
Did you lock the front door when you left?

252
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,547
No. I didn't have a key to the front door.

253
00:15:57,548 --> 00:16:00,678
Someone must've broken in after me.

254
00:16:00,908 --> 00:16:03,887
In other words, this case isn't a robbery and murder.

255
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:07,518
It's two separate cases: a burglary and a murder.

256
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:10,197
Yeah, that's right.

257
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:17,047
Yeah, but do you really think a murderer entered his home right after a burglar?

258
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:18,978
What kind of coincidence is that?

259
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:23,857
But I didn't bring or leave with a weapon.

260
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,157
Can you prove that?

261
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:29,877
Isn't it a detective's job to figure that out?

262
00:16:29,878 --> 00:16:31,768
A weapon, huh?

263
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:38,308
We'll hold him at our station as a key witness.

264
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:40,987
Mori-san.

265
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:45,867
If we let the police handle it, he just might confess to it.

266
00:16:45,868 --> 00:16:49,438
Mori-san, do you really believe he's a murderer?

267
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:50,438
What?

268
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:57,117
If the culprit is someone else, the police won't find him.

269
00:16:57,118 --> 00:17:00,448
Only you can do it, Mori-san. So...

270
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:01,948
I see.

271
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:08,287
If there's a true culprit who cleverly beat the police investigation,

272
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:12,088
then finding them would be a job for Mori Kogoro.

273
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:13,768
Thank you.

274
00:17:14,228 --> 00:17:15,338
Seriously?

275
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:19,468
Yeah, but we don't have any suspects.

276
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:24,778
Generally speaking, the motive is likely to be a grudge.

277
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:28,928
May I speak with your sister and mother?

278
00:17:29,478 --> 00:17:30,018
Yes.

279
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:31,908
I'll take you to the hospital.

280
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,717
Well, whatever.

281
00:17:35,718 --> 00:17:40,028
Honestly, I doubt Taira is the culprit either.

282
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:43,518
This case seems like there's more to it than meets the eye.

283
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:51,298
Can you think of anyone who may have resented Raita?

284
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:56,547
He was careful in his relationships with people. Right?

285
00:17:56,548 --> 00:17:59,088
Yeah. Almost too careful.

286
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:02,218
Did being too careful cause any problems?

287
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:07,088
Yeah. He was reluctant to get on board with my engagement.

288
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:09,887
He was convinced marrying into a wealthy family

289
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:13,108
would make maintaining relationships difficult.

290
00:18:13,578 --> 00:18:15,618
He let his imagination run wild.

291
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:19,848
But that had already been resolved.

292
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:24,998
He smiled and said he had been worried about nothing.

293
00:18:25,748 --> 00:18:27,208
I have another question.

294
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:32,128
Who knew Raita was at home that day?

295
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:35,147
I think it was just the three of us.

296
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:38,008
But he may have told someone.

297
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:42,637
The two of you were looking for Fusaya-san together

298
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:45,678
around 4:30 that day, right?

299
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:50,277
Not together. We split up.

300
00:18:50,278 --> 00:18:52,058
I see.

301
00:18:52,488 --> 00:18:55,167
But you returned together, right?

302
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,907
Yeah. We met up at night.

303
00:18:57,908 --> 00:18:59,847
We'd given up the search.

304
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,448
That's right.

305
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:05,497
What are you asking questions for?

306
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:08,717
In any case, let me handle this.

307
00:19:08,718 --> 00:19:11,958
I promise I'll expose the heinous culprit.

308
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,948
Take care. Excuse me.

309
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:22,338
He'll solve this case in no time, Sis.

310
00:19:22,888 --> 00:19:24,368
It seems like it.

311
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:27,668
I haven't seen you smile in forever.

312
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:30,358
I could say the same thing about you.

313
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:32,538
What is it?

314
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:33,758
It's just...

315
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:40,968
This will finally stop the gears of tragedy that have been turning for our family.

316
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:43,118
You're right.

317
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:46,997
If Dad accepted my engagement,

318
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:50,118
then I should move ahead with the wedding planning soon.

319
00:19:50,538 --> 00:19:53,108
More than anything, for Dad's sake, too.

320
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:58,328
That just leaves Fusaya's future.

321
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:07,397
Sorry about that.

322
00:20:07,398 --> 00:20:10,157
I'll do something about it soon.

323
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:16,768
Anyway, you weren't lying when you said the famous Mori-san accepted the case.

324
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,778
You didn't believe him?

325
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:22,958
We learned a lot, Mister.

326
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:28,788
Only those three knew Oide Raita-san was at home.

327
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:33,507
And while he expressed his disapproval of his daughter's engagement,

328
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:37,538
only his wife knew that issue had already been resolved.

329
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:44,298
Also, the sister and mom were acting separately when Raita-san was killed.

330
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,448
Hold on. I hate to consider it, but...

331
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:53,997
The mother secretly returned home to help her daughter get engaged,

332
00:20:53,998 --> 00:20:56,767
but Raita continued to disapprove of the idea, and...

333
00:20:56,768 --> 00:21:00,568
If that feebleness is just an act, then...

334
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:04,028
I see.

335
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:07,677
So she's definitely in a weakened state due to anxiety.

336
00:21:07,678 --> 00:21:12,327
Is it possible she's living an unhealthy life on purpose?

337
00:21:12,328 --> 00:21:18,848
Mori-san, despite your stature, I can't tell you the details of a patient's condition.

338
00:21:22,288 --> 00:21:24,298
I guess it was all in my head.

339
00:21:24,568 --> 00:21:29,548
It's possible her fear of being suspected caused her anxiety.

340
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,887
Damn it. I can't come up with anything.

341
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:35,537
I guess we'll get dinner and go home for today.

342
00:21:35,538 --> 00:21:37,308
I want sushi.

343
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:39,468
Nothing expensive.

344
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,317
Cheapskate.

345
00:21:41,318 --> 00:21:43,667
You're a kid. You should be eating kid's meals.

346
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:45,507
I know. Let's go to a family restaurant.

347
00:21:45,508 --> 00:21:47,318
Again?

348
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:50,957
What is it?

349
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,118
I felt like someone was watching us.

350
00:21:54,518 --> 00:21:56,118
Looks like it was my imagination.

351
00:21:56,408 --> 00:21:58,997
Jeez. Let's get out of here.

352
00:21:58,998 --> 00:22:00,218
Okay.

353
00:22:01,498 --> 00:22:04,378
The gears of tragedy that began turning for the Oide family.

354
00:22:05,128 --> 00:22:08,248
What exactly put them into motion?

355
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:14,498
Why was Oide Raita, who was home that day by chance, murdered?

356
00:22:17,998 --> 00:22:20,618
I'll definitely solve this mystery.

357
00:23:43,308 --> 00:23:45,927
The sudden sleepiness Raita mentioned

358
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:48,318
was due to the sleeping pills he was given taking effect.

359
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:52,377
I saw a suspicious person exit that house

360
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:54,778
on the day of the incident when the 4:30PM notice played.

361
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:58,388
Why didn't the culprit act right away?

362
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:02,917
Dad was really angry while he was fixing the shelf.

363
00:24:02,918 --> 00:24:04,828
We'll have to go to the hospital to check.

364
00:24:07,258 --> 00:24:11,668
The next episode of Conan is "The Automatic Tragedy, Part Two!"
