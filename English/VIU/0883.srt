"Grandpa Tick Tock and the Three Clocks."

00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:11,651
"Tick tock, tick tock.

5
00:00:11,652 --> 00:00:14,251
Grandpa Tick Tock is a clockmaker.

6
00:00:14,252 --> 00:00:16,651
He finished repairing the clocks.

7
00:00:16,652 --> 00:00:19,151
But he's exhausted,

8
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,451
and can't deliver them to his clients.

9
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:24,751
'In that case, I'll deliver the clocks

10
00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:27,452
to your clients for you!'"

11
00:00:33,052 --> 00:00:34,652
Everyone, run!

12
00:00:39,852 --> 00:00:41,251
There's a bomb in here!

13
00:00:41,252 --> 00:00:42,851
It's going to explode soon!

14
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:44,651
Hurry up and run!

15
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:47,452
Please run!

16
00:00:50,952 --> 00:00:52,951
It's a bomb!

17
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:54,052
Come on.

18
00:00:55,452 --> 00:00:56,652
Come on.

19
00:00:58,152 --> 00:00:59,851
We've done as you asked!

20
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,351
Now stop the timer!

21
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,451
Are you listening?

22
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:05,952
Dad.

23
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,551
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

24
00:01:19,552 --> 00:01:22,151
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

25
00:01:22,152 --> 00:01:23,751
The countdown won't stop.

26
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:25,951
The clues to the bombs are hidden in a pop-up book.

27
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,651
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:29,651
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:32,252
His name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,643
Coming!

34
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:52,043
"Grandpa Tick Tock and the Three Clocks" -What is this?

35
00:03:52,044 --> 00:03:55,043
Grandpa Tick Tock and the Three Clocks?

36
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:56,943
And a smartphone?

37
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:58,544
Is it a picture book?

38
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,444
There's something wrong with it, though.

39
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:07,243
Oh, I know.

40
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:10,343
It turns into a pop-up book once you put it together.

41
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:11,843
You're right.

42
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:14,943
This looks like a test print, though.

43
00:04:14,944 --> 00:04:16,743
A proof, huh?

44
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:20,743
But why'd they sent that to me?

45
00:04:20,744 --> 00:04:23,143
At dawn this morning an explosion occurred

46
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:26,543
at the Sandcastle pachinko parlor located in Beika City, Tokyo.

47
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:28,043
Huh?

48
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:31,343
-What is it? -What's wrong, Conan?

49
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:34,043
Look at this.

50
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:35,943
"Tick tock, tick tock.

51
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:39,943
Deliver the first clock to the castle made of sand."

52
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:43,643
That's a sandcastle.

53
00:04:43,644 --> 00:04:47,043
The name of the pachinko parlor that exploded is...

54
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:49,343
Now that you mention it, they said it was Sandcastle.

55
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:52,643
Well, it's just a coincidence.

56
00:04:52,644 --> 00:04:54,044
"Private Caller"

57
00:04:57,544 --> 00:05:01,643
"Grandpa Tick Tock" -Tick tock, tick tock. Boom!

58
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:05,144
Sixty minutes until the target after the castle of sand.

59
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:07,843
Is this...?

60
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:10,143
Is it Block 8 of Haido City?

61
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,744
Or is it Block 3?

62
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:15,643
Where is the bomb?

63
00:05:15,644 --> 00:05:17,843
Can the detective solve the mystery?

64
00:05:17,844 --> 00:05:19,543
Are... are they

65
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:21,843
warning us about the next explosion?

66
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:22,943
No way.

67
00:05:22,944 --> 00:05:25,943
What happens next in the picture book?

68
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:26,944
Give me a second.

69
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:30,743
"Tick tock, tick tock.

70
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:33,844
The destination of the second clock is a riddle."

71
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:38,343
"At a bus stop where five passengers are waiting,

72
00:05:38,344 --> 00:05:41,943
a bus with three passengers arrives.

73
00:05:41,944 --> 00:05:45,544
Two get off at the next stop, and one gets on."

74
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:49,743
"The next stop is the final stop.

75
00:05:49,744 --> 00:05:52,843
How many passengers are on the bus?"

76
00:05:52,844 --> 00:05:54,543
What's the answer?

77
00:05:54,544 --> 00:05:55,644
Let's see.

78
00:05:57,044 --> 00:05:58,344
It's torn.

79
00:05:59,044 --> 00:06:02,144
In other words, there's a bomb at this location.

80
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:04,743
Hold on, hold on.

81
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:07,343
There's five people waiting,

82
00:06:07,344 --> 00:06:09,643
and a bus with three passengers arrives,

83
00:06:09,644 --> 00:06:12,343
so all together that's eight.

84
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:14,443
At the next stop two get off, so it's six.

85
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:17,743
And one gets on, so that makes seven.

86
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,943
The answer is seven people.

87
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:22,843
But the smartphone message says

88
00:06:22,844 --> 00:06:24,944
it's either Block 8 or Block 3.

89
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:29,643
I know. The driver.

90
00:06:29,644 --> 00:06:31,643
So all together, there are eight passengers.

91
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:33,844
"Beika Bus" -The bomb is at the bus stop at Block 8.

92
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:37,043
The great Kogoro Mouri would never fall

93
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:39,844
for such a stupid trick question.

94
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:43,643
Hello, inspector?

95
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:44,943
Wait, pops!

96
00:06:44,944 --> 00:06:46,043
Huh?

97
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:50,543
It doesn't say the five people waiting at the bus stop got on the bus.

98
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:53,143
What? Which means...

99
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:56,243
subtracting five from eight gives you three.

100
00:06:56,244 --> 00:06:58,343
Which means it's at the bus stop at Block 3.

101
00:06:58,344 --> 00:07:00,844
Yeah. I think that's it.

102
00:07:03,644 --> 00:07:07,043
Really? I understand, inspector.

103
00:07:07,044 --> 00:07:09,243
Where did the messages come from?

104
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:13,343
Well, unfortunately, this is a burner.

105
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:16,143
Since the messages are being sent through several servers overseas,

106
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,343
they're having trouble determining where they came from.

107
00:07:18,344 --> 00:07:21,143
Wait, why are you coming with me?

108
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:22,843
It's too dangerous! Go home!

109
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:25,943
Conan's the one who solved the riddle.

110
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:30,043
And if Conan's going, it's only natural for me to come.

111
00:07:30,044 --> 00:07:31,843
Only natural?

112
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:33,243
We'll be fine.

113
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,643
We'll watch from a distance.

114
00:07:34,644 --> 00:07:35,943
You don't need to worry.

115
00:07:35,944 --> 00:07:37,243
Yeah.

116
00:07:37,244 --> 00:07:39,443
Yeah, but...

117
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:42,643
And if this really is a bomb threat,

118
00:07:42,644 --> 00:07:44,944
then the subsequent pages could be...

119
00:07:47,944 --> 00:07:49,943
And this must be...

120
00:07:49,944 --> 00:07:52,444
"Block 3 of Haido City, Haido Housing Complex North"

121
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:01,144
There's forty more minutes until the explosion.

122
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:09,743
Start searching the area immediately.

123
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:11,943
-Inspector! -Mouri.

124
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:13,243
We've identified the suspect.

125
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:15,344
What? Really?

126
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:20,443
Takuji Hirukawa, thirty-eight years old.

127
00:08:20,444 --> 00:08:22,943
After causing an explosion five years ago,

128
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:25,343
he fled overseas.

129
00:08:25,344 --> 00:08:28,243
It seems he secretly returned to the country.

130
00:08:28,244 --> 00:08:30,043
"Takuji Hirukawa (38), Bomber" -Hirukawa's fingerprints

131
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:33,243
were discovered at this morning's bomb site.

132
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:37,343
But why did he send you a bomb threat, pops?

133
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:39,043
How would I know?

134
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:42,843
I'm not involved with him in any way.

135
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:45,343
Yes, that's the question.

136
00:08:45,344 --> 00:08:46,644
-Chiba. -Yes, sir.

137
00:08:50,244 --> 00:08:53,343
Conan, could I see that book?

138
00:08:53,344 --> 00:08:55,743
Sure. Here.

139
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,343
Thanks.

140
00:08:57,344 --> 00:08:59,043
Well?

141
00:08:59,044 --> 00:09:00,643
This is it.

142
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:02,243
Three days ago he took it from us,

143
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:05,243
claiming his younger brother left it to him.

144
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,444
I'm sure of it.

145
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:12,743
And Hirukawa injured you then, didn't he?

146
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:14,243
Yes.

147
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:16,443
What's going on?

148
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:20,743
Kenichi Imai, the author of this picture book,

149
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:23,843
is actually Takuji Hirukawa's half brother.

150
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:25,043
His brother?

151
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:26,143
Yes.

152
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:29,943
But he passed away while Hirukawa was abroad.

153
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,243
I see.

154
00:09:31,244 --> 00:09:33,943
Oh, I hadn't introduced you yet.

155
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:39,144
This is Mr. Tomonaga, his brother's editor at the time.

156
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:44,143
"Hiroyuki Tomonaga (45), Editor In Chief" -Everyone was sure he'd win

157
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:46,743
the picture book new author award.

158
00:09:46,744 --> 00:09:49,943
We were pushing his book.

159
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:52,943
But his brother's criminal history was exposed online.

160
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:55,643
"By Kenichi Imai" -People said it wasn't appropriate for him

161
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:57,643
to write books for children.

162
00:09:57,644 --> 00:10:01,143
He was forced to withdraw from the contest.

163
00:10:01,144 --> 00:10:04,643
He became sick right after that.

164
00:10:04,644 --> 00:10:07,643
How awful.

165
00:10:07,644 --> 00:10:11,043
Rumor was a private detective

166
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:14,043
exposed his brother's criminal history.

167
00:10:14,044 --> 00:10:16,443
Hirukawa told friends and acquaintances

168
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:18,843
that it was the detective who killed his brother.

169
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:20,943
What?

170
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:22,543
Is that why he sent the book to me?

171
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:25,343
I don't remember doing anything like that!

172
00:10:25,344 --> 00:10:27,143
Are you sure, Mouri?

173
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:28,643
Of course.

174
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:33,643
It's not as though every detective is fit to be one,

175
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:37,244
but I, Kogoro Mouri, will make sure the scoundrel pays.

176
00:10:38,644 --> 00:10:43,143
No one was able to determine who the detective was either.

177
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:46,943
Most people think it was a groundless rumor.

178
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:49,843
So he was forced to choose you,

179
00:10:49,844 --> 00:10:52,243
a famous detective.

180
00:10:52,244 --> 00:10:54,343
That must be what happened.

181
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:56,643
Forced to?

182
00:10:56,644 --> 00:10:58,743
His resentment's misplaced.

183
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:02,043
In fact, it's completely unjustified.

184
00:11:02,044 --> 00:11:03,944
Hey, mister editor.

185
00:11:04,944 --> 00:11:08,943
Were those pages always torn out of the picture book?

186
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:11,343
Torn?

187
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:14,144
That's odd. They shouldn't be.

188
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:19,643
After his death, we decided to delay publishing the book,

189
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:23,043
but we stored the proof in a secure location.

190
00:11:23,044 --> 00:11:25,243
I think the torn pages

191
00:11:25,244 --> 00:11:30,343
may have contained the answers to the riddles and questions.

192
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:32,343
I see.

193
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:35,243
Since hints pertaining to the bombs were written on those pages,

194
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:38,244
the suspect Hirukawa tore them out.

195
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:43,043
Which means there are still other bombs?

196
00:11:43,044 --> 00:11:44,044
No way.

197
00:11:44,045 --> 00:11:46,944
Yeah, it's definitely likely.

198
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:50,744
So, what did those pages say originally?

199
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,143
The answers to the riddles.

200
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:55,743
Well...

201
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:57,443
People started talking about his brother

202
00:11:57,444 --> 00:12:00,243
right after we printed the proof.

203
00:12:00,244 --> 00:12:01,843
I was overwhelmed by dealing with that,

204
00:12:01,844 --> 00:12:04,344
so I never properly read them.

205
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:06,844
I see.

206
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:11,143
We found it!

207
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:13,944
It's inside a bag in a trash can!

208
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:27,616
Since hints pertaining to the bombs were written on those pages,

209
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:30,517
the suspect Hirukawa tore them out.

210
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,916
Which means there are still other bombs?

211
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:38,217
Yeah, it's definitely likely.

212
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:40,816
We found it!

213
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:43,617
It's inside a bag in a trash can!

214
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:49,516
Takagi, Chiba. Keep passersby away.

215
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:52,216
We'll wait until the bomb squad arrives.

216
00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:53,816
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

217
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:57,016
So the threat was real.

218
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:58,816
What does he think he's doing?

219
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:01,617
Dad. Conan.

220
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,817
What?

221
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:08,616
What's going on, Mouri?

222
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:11,416
The remaining time on the bomb suddenly changed to twenty minutes!

223
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:12,417
"Private Caller"

224
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:16,716
Tick tock, tick tock.

225
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:19,616
Name, arrow, make.

226
00:13:19,617 --> 00:13:22,116
Get it wrong, and kaboom!

227
00:13:22,117 --> 00:13:25,116
Don't make it in time, and kaboom!

228
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:27,716
People will die because of the detective.

229
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:30,216
Run, run, detective.

230
00:13:30,217 --> 00:13:33,416
What? Run?

231
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:35,416
Officer Chiba, can I see the book?

232
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:37,517
What? Okay.

233
00:13:40,517 --> 00:13:42,316
Look.

234
00:13:42,317 --> 00:13:44,816
"Who won the race?

235
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:46,716
Tick tock, tick tock.

236
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:50,716
Deliver the second clock to the park at the finish line."

237
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:53,516
Darn it. Another riddle?

238
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:54,917
What's the answer?

239
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,616
It's torn again.

240
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:58,816
Darn!

241
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:01,716
Race... Race...

242
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:03,017
What's he talking about?

243
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:16,516
Officer Takagi, could you draw up a list of all the parks

244
00:14:16,517 --> 00:14:18,017
within a twenty minute run from here?

245
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:20,317
That's it.

246
00:14:23,117 --> 00:14:24,916
I found them!

247
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:29,016
The corresponding parks are Aozora Fountain Plaza,

248
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:33,216
Flower Garden Isobe and Kanematsu Park!

249
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:34,416
I'm stumped.

250
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:37,016
Which one are we meant to go to?

251
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:38,217
Hold on.

252
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:43,216
That's it. I've got it.

253
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,516
-What? -Really, Dad?

254
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,816
"Flower Garden Isobe" -The kanji for the Isobe in Flower Garden Isobe

255
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:53,016
are either "Iso and Hen" or "Iso and Bu".

256
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,716
Iso, Bu. Isobu.

257
00:14:55,717 --> 00:14:57,916
In other words, Aesop.

258
00:14:57,917 --> 00:15:00,816
That's it. The participants of the race...

259
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,316
The one from Aesop's fables...

260
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:04,216
It was a hare and tortoise.

261
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:05,616
That's right.

262
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:09,517
In other words, the finish line is at Flower Garden Isobe.

263
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:12,717
But there's more to the message!

264
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:17,116
Let's head there.

265
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,616
Yes, sir...

266
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,816
Please take me with you.

267
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:23,316
I'm partially responsible.

268
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:26,217
And I may be able to remember something.

269
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:30,116
Very well. Get in.

270
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:32,816
Conan, we should go home.

271
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:33,817
Give me a second.

272
00:15:33,818 --> 00:15:34,917
Officer Takagi!

273
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:37,817
Could you show me the list again?

274
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:40,317
You mean this?

275
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:45,416
Aozora Fountain Plaza.

276
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:47,616
Flower Garden Isobe.

277
00:15:47,617 --> 00:15:49,817
Kanematsu Park.

278
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:53,417
That's it.

279
00:15:55,117 --> 00:15:57,016
"Grandpa Tick Tock" -Tick tock, tick tock.

280
00:15:57,017 --> 00:15:58,116
Boom!

281
00:15:58,117 --> 00:16:00,516
In 15 minutes.

282
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:02,716
People will die because of you.

283
00:16:02,717 --> 00:16:05,816
Run, run, detective!

284
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:08,517
Darn it! He won't beat me!

285
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:15,117
"Flower Garden Isobe"

286
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:20,916
I'm here. I made it.

287
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:23,117
Now it shouldn't explode.

288
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:28,217
Why hasn't it stopped?

289
00:16:29,217 --> 00:16:30,616
Tick tock, tick tock.

290
00:16:30,617 --> 00:16:31,617
Boom!

291
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:33,616
In ten minutes!

292
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,016
You can do it! You can do it!

293
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:37,216
Detective!

294
00:16:37,217 --> 00:16:38,616
What?

295
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:41,116
I'm here! Stop the timer!

296
00:16:41,117 --> 00:16:43,516
Are you listening?

297
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:45,216
What's wrong, Mouri?

298
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:48,616
The timer won't stop!

299
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:50,317
What?

300
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:53,016
Tick tock, tick tock.

301
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:54,316
Boom!

302
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:56,216
In eight minutes.

303
00:16:56,217 --> 00:16:59,016
What's wrong, detective?

304
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,616
Have you given up?

305
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:01,716
You can't be serious!

306
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:04,616
I, Kogoro Mouri, will never give up!

307
00:17:04,617 --> 00:17:06,316
It's not here, pops!

308
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,416
Huh?

309
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:10,116
This park was another trick answer!

310
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:11,516
What?

311
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:13,717
Get in, Dad!

312
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:20,916
You're sure this is it?

313
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:23,316
Yeah. Look at this.

314
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:27,116
It says Kanematsu Park in English.

315
00:17:27,117 --> 00:17:30,317
Remember the message before the riddle?

316
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:36,016
This "name, arrow, make" message?

317
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:37,316
Yeah.

318
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:41,516
The English translation for those words are "name" and "make".

319
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:44,316
In other words, "name, arrow, make" means

320
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:47,116
to turn name into make.

321
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:49,816
Turn "name" into "make"?

322
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:51,617
Turn name into make.

323
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:54,617
Turn name into make.

324
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:59,916
That's it! It means to change the N's into M's and M's into K's!

325
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:01,016
That's right.

326
00:18:01,017 --> 00:18:03,716
So if you turn the N's into M's

327
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:07,016
and M's into K's of Kanematsu Park...

328
00:18:07,017 --> 00:18:09,816
Ka-me-ka-tsu.

329
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:11,717
"Turtle wins" -Turtle wins!

330
00:18:13,117 --> 00:18:16,516
That's right. This must be the finish line of the race.

331
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:17,816
All right.

332
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:19,717
Everyone, run!

333
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:26,116
There's a bomb in here!

334
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:27,916
It's going to explode soon!

335
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,616
Hurry up and run!

336
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:32,817
Please run!

337
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:38,016
It's a bomb!

338
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,117
Come on.

339
00:18:40,517 --> 00:18:42,017
Come on.

340
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:44,916
We've done as you asked!

341
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,516
Now stop the timer!

342
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:49,516
Are you listening?

343
00:18:49,517 --> 00:18:51,217
Dad.

344
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:00,917
Answer me!

345
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:07,116
Pops, the rabbit and turtle statues around you

346
00:19:07,117 --> 00:19:09,817
are running towards the back of the park!

347
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,816
So the finish line is this way!

348
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,217
Conan!

349
00:19:19,217 --> 00:19:20,416
This must be the finish line.

350
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,716
"Goal" -Yeah.

351
00:19:22,717 --> 00:19:24,216
Mouri.

352
00:19:24,217 --> 00:19:26,016
Conan, it's too dangerous.

353
00:19:26,017 --> 00:19:28,416
Takagi, Chiba, lend me a hand.

354
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,117
We have to open the finish line.

355
00:19:31,117 --> 00:19:32,117
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

356
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:39,017
Stand back!

357
00:19:40,717 --> 00:19:42,017
Come on, Conan.

358
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,217
Get down!

359
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:04,316
It's not...

360
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:06,017
Exploding?

361
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:12,017
What's going on?

362
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:15,416
All right.

363
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:16,616
We did it.

364
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:20,516
The sewage must have damaged the detonator.

365
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:22,216
Mouri.

366
00:20:22,217 --> 00:20:24,116
Inspector, we did it.

367
00:20:24,117 --> 00:20:25,417
"Private Caller"

368
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:30,416
Tick tock, tick tock.

369
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:32,116
Boom!

370
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:36,016
Well done, Detective Kogoro Mouri.

371
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:39,817
But the game isn't over yet.

372
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:42,616
What?

373
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:45,016
Mouri, does this mean...

374
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:49,617
Yes. The bomb threat isn't over yet.

375
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:53,816
Mouri, where's the next bomb?

376
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:57,317
Well, until we receive the next message...

377
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:00,417
Conan, that book.

378
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:05,217
That's it. There's more to the book.

379
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:11,016
That's it.

380
00:21:11,017 --> 00:21:13,316
"Tick tock, tick tock.

381
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:17,417
Deliver the final clock to the middle of the 7."

382
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:20,517
What's next?

383
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:22,716
It's no use.

384
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:24,516
It's been torn out.

385
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,016
Darn it!

386
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:28,317
What's the middle of the seven supposed to mean?

387
00:21:29,617 --> 00:21:31,817
The middle of the seven?

388
00:21:37,817 --> 00:21:40,017
That's odd, though.

389
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:46,116
Until now, the riddles have been fairly straightforward.

390
00:21:46,117 --> 00:21:47,117
But...

391
00:21:48,117 --> 00:21:50,616
Middle of the seven?

392
00:21:50,617 --> 00:21:52,817
That's too vague a clue.

393
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:58,217
What does it mean?

394
00:23:42,317 --> 00:23:45,916
"Next Episode" -What does the number seven remind you of?

395
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:48,917
The seven colors of the rainbow?

396
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:53,516
There are seven notes in a musical scale, too.

397
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:56,216
What? You found the bomb?

398
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:59,816
We found all three of the bombs!

399
00:23:59,817 --> 00:24:02,116
Tell us how to disarm them!

400
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:03,517
Hey, answer me!

401
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:06,117
Answer me!

402
00:24:07,117 --> 00:24:08,716
Next Conan,

403
00:24:08,717 --> 00:24:12,317
"The Pop-up Book Bomber (Part 2)"
