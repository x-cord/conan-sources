1
00:00:00,891 --> 00:00:02,790
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:04,690
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04,691 --> 00:00:06,590
His girlfriend leaves home after a trivial argument.

4
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:08,890
This leads to a sad reencounter at the place where they first met.

5
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:10,390
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:12,190
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:13,991
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:56,676
And?

9
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:58,723
When is he coming?

10
00:01:58,724 --> 00:02:01,524
He says he'll come after changing clothes at home.

11
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,224
Who's he?

12
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:06,723
Don't you remember? I told you the other day.

13
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:10,324
A new student who came to our class is going to come over.

14
00:02:11,724 --> 00:02:13,023
Come on, Ran!

15
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:15,724
-Let's go! -Okay.

16
00:02:18,024 --> 00:02:19,324
A new student?

17
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:22,323
Oh, right.

18
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:23,823
When I talked about this,

19
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:25,823
you were asleep, weren't you?

20
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:27,423
Hey.

21
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:30,023
Why is that person coming here?

22
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,424
Why not?

23
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:35,123
Oh, my.

24
00:02:35,124 --> 00:02:40,223
This kid thinks that you got a boyfriend and is getting jealous.

25
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:42,323
Come on, Sonoko.

26
00:02:42,324 --> 00:02:43,723
That's not it!

27
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:45,223
Then what is it?

28
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:47,923
Are you going to squeal to Shinichi about this?

29
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:50,023
I am him in person.

30
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:52,423
Too bad!

31
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:54,824
He's not coming here because of me.

32
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:58,323
Hi, Ran.

33
00:02:58,324 --> 00:02:59,723
You're back early.

34
00:02:59,724 --> 00:03:01,723
I hate to ask you a favour when you just got back,

35
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:04,523
but would you give me a cup of coffee?

36
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:07,223
Unless it's the coffee you make,

37
00:03:07,224 --> 00:03:11,224
it seems that my brain cells get sulky and refuse to get up.

38
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:23,623
Who are you mimicking?

39
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:25,624
Mr. Mouri, are you okay?

40
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:29,223
Come on!

41
00:03:29,224 --> 00:03:33,023
It's only the filthy rich tempestuous girl!

42
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:36,123
What? Tempestuous?

43
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:37,623
-If you're talking about the one who's coming here, -Hey!

44
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:39,323
he says he's coming here later!

45
00:03:39,324 --> 00:03:42,923
Is that person coming to see Pops?

46
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:46,323
Yes. He says he's a great fan of dad.

47
00:03:46,324 --> 00:03:49,523
Are you relieved, glasses brat?

48
00:03:49,524 --> 00:03:52,023
Sonoko, you're going to get it.

49
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:55,324
A great fan of Pops?

50
00:03:57,124 --> 00:04:02,924
"The Point of No Return (Part 1)"

51
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:08,724
I was looking forward to the guest.

52
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:11,423
But...

53
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:15,824
what's the point of putting on airs for a high school boy?

54
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,823
A boy?

55
00:04:20,824 --> 00:04:23,723
Huh? Wasn't she supposed to be a high school girl

56
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:26,724
who resembled Reina Mizunashi the announcer?

57
00:04:28,424 --> 00:04:29,624
Reina Mizunashi?

58
00:04:36,324 --> 00:04:40,023
I told you it was a boy student!

59
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:43,924
You used to say, "that cute kid" so I took him to be a girl.

60
00:04:46,324 --> 00:04:48,724
No, Pops! Don't meet him!

61
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:54,224
He is here!

62
00:04:57,024 --> 00:04:58,024
Come in!

63
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:00,824
Pops!

64
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:16,224
Ouch.

65
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:19,723
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:19,724 --> 00:05:22,224
I tripped over something.

67
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:33,123
How do you do, Detective Mouri?

68
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,224
It's an honour to see you!

69
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:43,524
He's Conan, who's staying with us for now.

70
00:05:51,124 --> 00:05:52,623
Huh?

71
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:55,923
Like I just said, he's staying with us.

72
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:57,524
He's a glasses brat.

73
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:01,623
Here, your glasses!

74
00:06:01,624 --> 00:06:04,323
Thank you.

75
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:06,324
He's my father.

76
00:06:10,424 --> 00:06:12,023
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:14,723
How do you do, Detective Mouri?

78
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:16,824
I'm Eisuke Hondo.

79
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:20,523
Hello.

80
00:06:20,524 --> 00:06:22,524
Nice to meet you.

81
00:06:24,824 --> 00:06:26,724
It hurts.

82
00:06:27,924 --> 00:06:29,624
It hurts.

83
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:38,624
Ouch...

84
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:42,223
What's with this guy?

85
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:48,023
I kind of understand why Ran referred to him as "the kid".

86
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:50,723
He's just a bit of a klutz.

87
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:53,524
I'm not a klutz, just unlucky!

88
00:06:54,924 --> 00:06:58,724
If I drop my toast, the buttered side will definitely fall on the ground.

89
00:07:00,324 --> 00:07:03,924
If I go camping, I'm the first to get bitten by mosquitoes.

90
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,823
If I take a group picture with everyone,

91
00:07:06,824 --> 00:07:09,423
for some reason I'm the only one with my eyes closed.

92
00:07:09,424 --> 00:07:11,724
God must not like me!

93
00:07:13,524 --> 00:07:17,123
If you were a girl, you would be a cute little klutz, but...

94
00:07:17,124 --> 00:07:20,523
That's why I wanted to meet Detective Mouri!

95
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,823
Huh? Why?

96
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:26,823
I want you to share just a little bit of your good luck with me!

97
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:28,023
Good luck?

98
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:33,723
I mean, being able to solve cases while asleep is super lucky!

99
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:37,723
I'm sure that only during that time, God descends on you!

100
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,123
God? Come on.

101
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:45,023
It's true that dad is called the "Sleeping Kogoro",

102
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:47,523
but he's just looking down and revealing the truth,

103
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:49,823
and not really asleep, you know.

104
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:53,223
But he usually avoids answering during interviews after solving cases,

105
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:58,623
saying things like, "I forgot", or "Ask the police", right?

106
00:07:58,624 --> 00:08:01,223
Come to think of it...

107
00:08:01,224 --> 00:08:03,723
He's just saying so because he's embarrassed!

108
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:05,523
He remembers everything.

109
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:06,923
Right, dad?

110
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:10,323
Yeah, sort of.

111
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,723
Please show me the "Sleeping Kogoro".

112
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:15,023
Please!

113
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:17,223
Yeah, but...

114
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:19,624
He's a load of trouble.

115
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:23,523
Excuse me.

116
00:08:23,524 --> 00:08:27,023
"Atsushi Misumi (32)" -Is this the Mouri Detective Agency?

117
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:28,024
Yes.

118
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:34,024
You touched my breasts! How dare he touch me!

119
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:37,623
Are you here to ask him to solve a case?

120
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:40,523
Sort of.

121
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:43,423
Detective Mouri! He wants you to solve a case!

122
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:45,124
All right!

123
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:47,224
Not again.

124
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:49,523
Ouch. Not again.

125
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:51,624
My nose...

126
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:05,123
A born klutz. Goodness.

127
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:07,323
Please don't let it bother you.

128
00:09:07,324 --> 00:09:09,224
Oh, okay.

129
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:16,323
You want me to find your girlfriend who disappeared?

130
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:17,623
Yes.

131
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,323
I'm living with her,

132
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:22,823
but this morning when I got up, she was gone.

133
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:24,123
The reason she left

134
00:09:24,124 --> 00:09:28,923
is probably because of the argument we had last night.

135
00:09:28,924 --> 00:09:32,823
If it's okay with you, would you please tell me what you argued about?

136
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:34,224
Oh, yes.

137
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:39,223
Hey!

138
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:41,423
You guys, go away.

139
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:43,223
It's okay!

140
00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:46,723
It's just the usual argument that anybody has.

141
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:48,723
I see.

142
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:49,823
Okay.

143
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:51,023
Right.

144
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:56,123
I've been busy lately and unable to spend much time with her.

145
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:58,623
That's what triggered our argument,

146
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:01,723
but after having said what we both wanted to say...

147
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:03,723
You've changed!

148
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:06,123
And I haven't changed at all!

149
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:08,123
We are at the point of no return.

150
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:10,323
We can never go back to how when we first met.

151
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:14,123
After that remark, she didn't say anything and went to sleep.

152
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:17,524
When I got up in the morning, she and the car were gone.

153
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:22,523
It sure sounds like any other lover's quarrel.

154
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:25,323
The possibility of this being a criminal case is very low.

155
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,324
She just simply left.

156
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:32,823
I'm sure she'll return in two to three days.

157
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:34,723
I can't wait that long!

158
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:36,623
Tomorrow I have to turn in some documents to the company,

159
00:10:36,624 --> 00:10:40,223
but I left it in the car that she took!

160
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:43,824
So I need to find her by today no matter what!

161
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:49,523
Of course I'm worried about her, too.

162
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,123
I see.

163
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:54,723
I understand, but there's so little to go on.

164
00:10:54,724 --> 00:10:56,623
Hey.

165
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:58,023
Did she know

166
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,823
that you had important papers from your company in the car?

167
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:03,523
Yeah.

168
00:11:03,524 --> 00:11:07,524
If so, she could just be trying to be mean to you.

169
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:10,723
Trying to be mean?

170
00:11:10,724 --> 00:11:14,523
Yeah! I think she wants you to come look for her,

171
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:18,323
to the place where you both played Japanese Parcheesi in the past.

172
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:19,723
Japanese Parcheesi?

173
00:11:19,724 --> 00:11:21,423
Just what does that mean?

174
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:22,424
Remember?

175
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:26,723
He said a while ago, "We're at a point of no return."

176
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:29,823
Isn't that about Parcheesi?

177
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:32,223
When I played Parcheesi with Ran the other day,

178
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,723
I hit the point of no return, too!

179
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:39,223
Ran, are you playing Parcheesi with this glasses brat?

180
00:11:39,224 --> 00:11:41,823
It's the TV game "Budori Street".

181
00:11:41,824 --> 00:11:43,624
Conan is good at it.

182
00:11:45,424 --> 00:11:49,023
You're so stupid.

183
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:50,623
The point of no return that he's talking about

184
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:55,224
is not being able to return to how they used to be when they first met.

185
00:12:00,324 --> 00:12:06,623
Maybe she's where you both first met each other?

186
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:07,923
Right, right.

187
00:12:07,924 --> 00:12:12,023
After having a fight, if she wants to be mean and make you find her,

188
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,524
that could be the ideal place.

189
00:12:15,124 --> 00:12:17,123
Anyway, Mr. Misumi...

190
00:12:17,124 --> 00:12:18,423
What is it?

191
00:12:18,424 --> 00:12:20,823
Where did you first meet her?

192
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:21,923
Right.

193
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:24,424
At a ski range in Gunma.

194
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:37,896
That's why I told you not to come.

195
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:40,296
Are you all right, Eisuke?

196
00:12:40,297 --> 00:12:41,496
See.

197
00:12:41,497 --> 00:12:44,897
In situations like these, I'm the first one to catch a cold.

198
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:52,096
It's snowing so hard, so maybe Sonoko was right not wanting to come.

199
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:53,796
Gunma?

200
00:12:53,797 --> 00:12:57,196
It'll be covered in snow this time of the year.

201
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:59,797
I'm sorry, Ran. Would you mind me not going this time?

202
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,797
Right.

203
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:06,896
Hey, don't you give your cold to Ran.

204
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:10,096
I'm fine. Because Conan's so warm.

205
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:12,096
Same here.

206
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:13,196
And?

207
00:13:13,197 --> 00:13:17,596
Did you two really meet on this freezing mountain?

208
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:18,896
Yes.

209
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:24,196
She drove here with three of her friends,

210
00:13:24,197 --> 00:13:26,996
but when she drove through the short cut of the mountain road here,

211
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:29,997
the engine stopped and they were stalled.

212
00:13:31,697 --> 00:13:33,196
What seems to be the matter?

213
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:36,596
We're in a fix because our car stopped moving.

214
00:13:36,597 --> 00:13:39,896
No cars have passed by either.

215
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:40,897
I'm so glad.

216
00:13:42,897 --> 00:13:46,597
So, the place where we first met is the road just up ahead.

217
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:55,096
On the other side of that tree!

218
00:13:55,097 --> 00:13:56,197
That's my car!

219
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:05,197
Case closed, I guess.

220
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,596
Ami? Ami?

221
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:20,996
Hey, Ami! Get a hold of yourself!

222
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:22,297
Hey! What is it?

223
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,196
I'll go check!

224
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:28,197
Wait.

225
00:14:41,497 --> 00:14:45,497
The space between both doors are sealed tightly with masking tape.

226
00:14:48,497 --> 00:14:51,296
There is a portable clay charcoal stove by the passenger's seat.

227
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:52,397
Suicide?

228
00:14:55,197 --> 00:14:57,896
Where's the key? Don't you have a spare key?

229
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,597
I do!

230
00:15:07,397 --> 00:15:08,496
Darn it!

231
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:12,896
It's sealed tight with masking tape. It won't open.

232
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:16,396
I guess we'll have to call the police and break it open using tools.

233
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:17,797
Please stay back.

234
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,796
Where did you get that bat?

235
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:36,696
I always keep a bat for playing a sandlot game in the trunk of my car.

236
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:38,997
Ami! I'll get you out of there right now!

237
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:43,197
Ami!

238
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:49,897
Ami!

239
00:15:58,397 --> 00:15:59,397
Ami?

240
00:16:01,997 --> 00:16:06,396
Peel off the masking tape on the door of the car for now!

241
00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:07,597
Yes, sir!

242
00:16:09,497 --> 00:16:12,296
But it's very tightly sealed.

243
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:13,597
It's hard to peel all of it off.

244
00:16:15,897 --> 00:16:17,596
That's right.

245
00:16:17,597 --> 00:16:19,597
There should be a cutter in here.

246
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:41,197
Ami?

247
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:42,696
Get a hold of yourself, Ami!

248
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:45,496
Ami?

249
00:16:45,497 --> 00:16:48,696
From the looks of it, she's already dead.

250
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:49,896
Oh, no.

251
00:16:49,897 --> 00:16:52,097
Ami! Ami!

252
00:16:56,297 --> 00:16:58,997
Ami! Hey, Ami!

253
00:17:07,597 --> 00:17:11,696
I guess I'll call an ambulance as well as the Gunma police.

254
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,496
I called them a while ago.

255
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:19,096
I was told that an officer who is a great partner of yours is coming!

256
00:17:19,097 --> 00:17:22,197
Hey. Don't tell me that it's...

257
00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:28,297
So it's him after all.

258
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:33,896
What makes us great partners?

259
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:37,596
Just what do think you're saying, Mr. Mouri?

260
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:41,896
Every case we've worked on together has been solved!

261
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:44,196
It's 100%!

262
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:47,196
Then what about all the other cases?

263
00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:49,996
Well, you see...

264
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:52,996
All the other cases aren't solved.

265
00:17:52,997 --> 00:17:56,996
Let's leave the tidbits aside and start the investigation.

266
00:17:56,997 --> 00:18:00,696
I'm going to get a picture of the Sleeping Kogoro for sure today.

267
00:18:00,697 --> 00:18:03,397
I'm sorry to say this, but that won't be possible.

268
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:08,796
Look at the car that the woman was in.

269
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:12,996
The door is sealed tight from the inside of the car with masking tape.

270
00:18:12,997 --> 00:18:15,796
There is a portable charcoal stove by the passenger's seat

271
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:18,096
with burned remains of solid fuel.

272
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,196
The woman was carried out of the car

273
00:18:20,197 --> 00:18:22,996
after cracking the windshield with a metal bat.

274
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:25,796
Because that was the only way to get in or out of the car.

275
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:30,596
In other words, this is carbon monoxide poisoning,

276
00:18:30,597 --> 00:18:32,896
that was carried out by burning solid fuel in a sealed car.

277
00:18:32,897 --> 00:18:35,996
There's no doubt that she committed suicide.

278
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:37,396
-What? -What?

279
00:18:37,397 --> 00:18:39,296
-It means we don't get to see... -It means we don't get to see...

280
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:42,196
-the Sleeping Kogoro at work? -the Sleeping Kogoro at work?

281
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:44,196
Who is this young lad?

282
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:49,696
Oh, he's just a high school fan that came along with us.

283
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:50,996
A fan of Mr. Mouri?

284
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,096
Yes, sir!

285
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,996
How do you do? I'm Eisuke Hondo!

286
00:18:54,997 --> 00:18:57,796
This is the first time I'm meeting a real police detective,

287
00:18:57,797 --> 00:18:58,997
so I'm really excited!

288
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:03,596
I'm Officer Yamamura of the Gunma Police Department.

289
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:06,497
You can call me Mr. Yama.

290
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:10,097
They make a great pair.

291
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:16,896
-Mr. Yamamura. -Yes?

292
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:20,996
Sleeping drug was detected from the canned coffee on the car floor.

293
00:19:20,997 --> 00:19:22,596
A sleeping drug?

294
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:27,096
Anxious of whether she could really die or not,

295
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:29,396
I think she drank it just be sure she would succeed.

296
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:31,096
I see!

297
00:19:31,097 --> 00:19:32,497
If so...

298
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:37,696
the woman must've had really bad sleeping posture.

299
00:19:37,697 --> 00:19:38,996
What?

300
00:19:38,997 --> 00:19:42,496
She was sitting nicely in the driver's seat, wasn't she?

301
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:49,096
But I saw a folded part on the top of her clothes near her hips.

302
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:50,396
She would most likely be bothered

303
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,196
if she was sitting nicely and fix it right away.

304
00:19:53,197 --> 00:19:57,796
So the crease was probably made while she was asleep, right?

305
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,596
It seems to have been so.

306
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:03,796
And the same goes for the driver's seat.

307
00:20:03,797 --> 00:20:04,797
What?

308
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:08,597
Come with me, Ran.

309
00:20:09,697 --> 00:20:11,096
Okay.

310
00:20:11,097 --> 00:20:12,896
Bend down beside the car

311
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:14,696
and pretend that you're holding the steering wheel.

312
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:16,197
Oh, okay.

313
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:19,896
Like this?

314
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:24,596
See? The woman was in the same position that Ran is now,

315
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:26,996
so isn't the seat too far back for her?

316
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:28,996
Maybe she had bad sleeping posture

317
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:31,397
so she pushed her seat back before going to sleep.

318
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:34,896
It's true.

319
00:20:34,897 --> 00:20:39,196
The seat is too far back for the woman to have been driving.

320
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:42,496
Isn't that probably because she moved the seat back

321
00:20:42,497 --> 00:20:44,796
in order to place the portable charcoal stove at the feet?

322
00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:46,196
I see.

323
00:20:46,197 --> 00:20:48,396
She put it at her feet,

324
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:50,996
but moved it over to the passenger's seat because it was too hot.

325
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:53,596
By the way, who are you?

326
00:20:53,597 --> 00:20:54,696
Right.

327
00:20:54,697 --> 00:20:57,696
I was dating the woman who committed suicide in this car.

328
00:20:57,697 --> 00:21:00,096
I'm Atsushi Misumi.

329
00:21:00,097 --> 00:21:02,596
I'm so sorry. My condolences.

330
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:06,996
And? Did she have bad sleeping posture?

331
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:08,096
Yes.

332
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:10,996
She didn't have very good sleeping posture.

333
00:21:10,997 --> 00:21:12,496
I see.

334
00:21:12,497 --> 00:21:15,496
Then it is suicide after all.

335
00:21:15,497 --> 00:21:17,097
I guess so.

336
00:21:26,497 --> 00:21:27,896
No.

337
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:31,396
This is cleverly schemed homicide that was set up to look as suicide.

338
00:21:31,397 --> 00:21:34,096
Moreover, the culprit is probably...

339
00:21:34,097 --> 00:21:36,196
that man.

340
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:38,596
But I don't understand.

341
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:42,397
How did he get out of the sealed car?

342
00:22:01,097 --> 00:22:05,396
The car was sealed tightly from the inside with masking tape.

343
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:08,796
And to keep her in the seat...

344
00:22:08,797 --> 00:22:12,497
What kind of trick did he use?

345
00:23:43,497 --> 00:23:44,996
"Next Episode."

346
00:23:44,997 --> 00:23:48,596
That all absorbing attitude as if to despise everyone is indeed

347
00:23:48,597 --> 00:23:50,197
the Sleeping Kogoro!

348
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,297
Wait a second.

349
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:53,697
That masking tape...

350
00:23:58,697 --> 00:24:00,696
Doesn't it bother you?

351
00:24:00,697 --> 00:24:01,896
What?

352
00:24:01,897 --> 00:24:03,796
Next to Mr. Mouri...

353
00:24:03,797 --> 00:24:05,497
Oh, you mean Conan?

354
00:24:07,997 --> 00:24:13,497
Next Conan, "The Point of No Return (Part 2)"

355
00:24:29,297 --> 00:24:31,396
Next Conan's Hint:

356
00:24:31,397 --> 00:24:33,796
"Bandage"

357
00:24:33,797 --> 00:24:35,896
I have a stomachache so give me bandage.

358
00:24:35,897 --> 00:24:36,996
I don't think it will cure your stomachache.

359
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:38,297
Is that so?
