1
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:20,489
Smile Village

2
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,500
Smile Village

3
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:40,010
Welcome to the high-class resort-style nursing home "Smile Village!"

4
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,120
What?

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,019
Find the question that solves the mystery!

6
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,229
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

7
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,839
The Detective Boys are everyone's idols!

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,840
What plot is hidden behind their smiles?

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,859
Always determining the one truth

10
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,759
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,200
his name is Detective Conan!

12
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:46,551
Intrigue at Smile Village

13
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:50,970
Come on. Everyone is waiting, Edogawa-sama.

14
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,301
Everyone?

15
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,842
Sakura-sama, Sumire-sama,

16
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:58,502
Botan-sama, Azami-sama, and...

17
00:02:58,503 --> 00:02:59,963
Hey, Conan!

18
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:01,482
Conan-kun!

19
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:03,463
You're late.

20
00:03:03,903 --> 00:03:05,023
Guys.

21
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:11,392
Those ladies over there are devoted fans of the Detective Boys.

22
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:14,042
D-Devoted fans?

23
00:03:14,043 --> 00:03:16,262
It happened two weeks ago.

24
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:22,432
We were on a luxurious sightseeing bus tour of Beika City.

25
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:27,903
An acorn rolled down and down

26
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:32,783
and fell into a pond.

27
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:36,713
A loach swam up and...

28
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:39,673
Oh, my!

29
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:47,433
These are delicious.

30
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:54,632
Since then, the Detective Boys have become Sakura-sama,

31
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:59,433
Sumire-sama, Botan-sama and Azami-sama's idols.

32
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:02,693
They even formed a fan club.

33
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:04,943
Now then.

34
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:08,993
Since all the members of the Detective Boys are here...

35
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:10,792
Azami-sama.

36
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:11,983
Yes.

37
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:14,252
Botan-sama.

38
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:15,533
Yes.

39
00:04:16,193 --> 00:04:17,612
Sumire-sama.

40
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:18,753
Yes.

41
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,252
Sakura-sama.

42
00:04:21,253 --> 00:04:22,223
Yes.

43
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:27,652
Imagine that the Detective Boys are your own grandchildren

44
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:29,463
and show them to your rooms.

45
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:32,482
Actually, I'm not so sure about...

46
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:34,093
Edogawa-sama.

47
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:38,223
Think of them as your grandmothers, okay?

48
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:40,513
B-But...

49
00:04:41,723 --> 00:04:42,603
Ondo.

50
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:43,983
Ondo?

51
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:50,743
Shibuzura Ondo (30) "Smile Village" Employee

52
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:03,483
Lay him down on that bed over there.

53
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:10,633
Thank you.

54
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:18,002
Anyway, this room is really luxurious.

55
00:05:18,003 --> 00:05:21,773
I had it remodeled in a Baroque architectural style.

56
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:23,773
I see.

57
00:05:24,253 --> 00:05:29,692
It was my dream to sing lullabies to my grandchildren.

58
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:32,223
Was it?

59
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:46,753
Hushabye, hushabye.

60
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:57,183
My good baby, sleep.

61
00:05:57,573 --> 00:06:00,233
My good baby...

62
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:11,893
She put herself to sleep with her own lullaby.

63
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:25,583
Um, where's the bathroom?

64
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:30,633
Gotta go, gotta go.

65
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,673
Gotta go.

66
00:07:25,273 --> 00:07:27,073
You guys, too?

67
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:34,193
I was with Botan-obaasan.

68
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:06,972
It was my dream to peel fruit from around the world for my grandchildren.

69
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:09,853
Say ah. Eat up.

70
00:08:14,063 --> 00:08:16,193
Say ah.

71
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:20,203
Ah.

72
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:23,663
Ah.

73
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:38,213
Excuse me for a moment.

74
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:49,683
I was with Azami-obaasama.

75
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:10,203
This is my collection.

76
00:09:11,023 --> 00:09:11,823
What?

77
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:34,103
I especially like these dentures decorated with diamonds.

78
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,103
I'll show you some ventriloquism.

79
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:41,113
Ventriloquism?

80
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:45,363
Please tell me your name.

81
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:53,013
Please tell me your name.

82
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:56,253
It's Ayumi.

83
00:09:56,493 --> 00:10:01,852
My name is Azagami Azami.

84
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:03,933
Nice to meet you.

85
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:25,033
As soon as we entered Sumire-baachan's room...

86
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:56,062
Ow!

87
00:10:56,063 --> 00:10:57,703
My butt, my butt!

88
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:00,592
You pinched me!

89
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,882
What are you doing, Grandma?

90
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:06,492
Pain, pain, fly away.

91
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:09,453
Pain, pain, fly away.

92
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:14,673
Pain, pain, fly away.

93
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:25,493
Hey, w-w-wait.

94
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:34,223
Crap!

95
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:38,853
Are you okay?

96
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:47,863
Oh, no. Oh, no.

97
00:11:52,883 --> 00:11:57,873
So all the old women are insanely wealthy.

98
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:00,873
Indeed.

99
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:07,633
I guess we can let it slide since they're our fans.

100
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:11,412
It's the married couple Chief Director Hohoemi Waltz-san

101
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:14,293
and Administration Manager Tango-san that creep me out.

102
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:16,963
They're always smiling.

103
00:12:17,643 --> 00:12:21,263
Yeah, they've been smiling since we met.

104
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:30,403
All right.

105
00:12:43,923 --> 00:12:45,923
1 Million Yen Savings

106
00:12:56,963 --> 00:12:58,933
They're smiling.

107
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:03,832
Maybe they have to smile because they're the chief director

108
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,433
and administration manager of Smile Village.

109
00:13:07,123 --> 00:13:11,073
Isn't that what they call a customer service smile?

110
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:13,043
They're right.

111
00:13:25,113 --> 00:13:29,003
Were those old hags...?

112
00:13:29,453 --> 00:13:33,513
Yes, those old hags.

113
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:43,433
Smile Village

114
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:48,640
I never imagined that those old hags

115
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:51,091
would be scouted by another nursing home.

116
00:13:53,151 --> 00:13:56,570
Considering how much money they have,

117
00:13:56,571 --> 00:14:00,871
I understand why other nursing homes would want them to move in.

118
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:07,070
By letting them meet their idols the Detective Boys,

119
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:10,111
they'll stay at Smile Village.

120
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:14,170
We should thank the Detective Boys.

121
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:15,741
Indeed.

122
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:19,001
They appreciate us.

123
00:14:19,711 --> 00:14:21,251
They used us.

124
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:22,521
What?

125
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:24,970
Waltz.

126
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:27,000
What is it, Tango?

127
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:32,881
We need to buy a high-class hotel in Dubai before those old hags catch on.

128
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:38,721
Using their money that we've been managing.

129
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:45,231
This is the list of high-class hotels Dubai we'll purchase.

130
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:53,520
If those old hags learned we're planning to buy a high-class hotel in Dubai,

131
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:58,131
I'm sure their blood pressure would rise.

132
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:06,211
What's Dubai?

133
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:09,461
A world famous resort city in the Middle East.

134
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:11,030
Middle East?

135
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:15,270
They said they're planning to buy a hotel using the old women's money.

136
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:18,960
They're using their money without their knowledge.

137
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,351
Those poor old ladies.

138
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:26,690
Tango, you decide which hotel we'll buy.

139
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:29,471
Waltz, you decide.

140
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:34,130
Darling, you're my husband. You should decide.

141
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:37,670
Oh, Waltz. You're my wife.

142
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:39,630
You should decide.

143
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:40,541
Tango.

144
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:41,590
Waltz.

145
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:42,491
Tango.

146
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:43,581
Waltz.

147
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:47,961
They're dancing even though they're bad guys.

148
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:50,341
It's not pretty at all.

149
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:53,090
In fact, it's unsightly.

150
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,400
Waltz.

151
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:55,091
Tango.

152
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:56,350
Waltz.

153
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:57,011
Tango.

154
00:15:57,011 --> 00:15:57,971
Waltz.

155
00:15:57,972 --> 00:15:59,391
Tango.

156
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:04,101
I'm sick of taking care of wealthy old Japanese people.

157
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:09,140
So we'll use their money to buy a high-class hotel in Dubai

158
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:14,120
and open a Smile Village there.

159
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:16,661
Smile Village Dubai.

160
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:25,141
We'll care for the world's wealthy old people and use their money

161
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:29,380
to build a Smile Village in space.

162
00:16:29,381 --> 00:16:34,090
I'm thinking about making Cosmic Smile Village Japanese style.

163
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:36,220
Japanese style.

164
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:37,340
And once we do,

165
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:42,150
I'll devote my heart the Manyoshu and wear a twelve-layered ceremonial kimono.

166
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:45,591
Devote your heart to the Manyoshu.

167
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:51,270
More importantly...

168
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:52,981
What is it, Waltz?

169
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:57,250
We need to make those old hags sign an exclusive contract

170
00:16:57,251 --> 00:17:02,121
so they can't be scouted by another nursing home again.

171
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:05,501
You're right.

172
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:10,401

The Detective Boys?

175
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:21,761
Ondo!

176
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:26,721
Chief Director's Office

177
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:50,011
Let go of me!

178
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:54,441
Let go of me! Hey!

179
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:00,930
Let go! Let go!

180
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:02,730
Please let go!

181
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:03,811
Let me go!

182
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:16,271
Let us go!

183
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:19,031
Lock them in the basement.

184
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,031
Let us go!

185
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:27,930
What are you doing?

186
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:30,360
Where are you taking us?

187
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:33,450
Stop it! Stop!

188
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:35,171
Let us go!

189
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:38,531
Ow!

190
00:18:56,811 --> 00:19:00,170
Hey, let us out! Let us out!

191
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:05,111
Ow. I hurt my teeth biting him as hard as I could.

192
00:19:05,871 --> 00:19:06,821
Guys.

193
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:07,531
Conan?

194
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:08,810
Conan-kun?

195
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:11,860
They've installed multiple solid locks on the door.

196
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:14,081
Stand back. I'll break it open.

197
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:15,561
All right.

198
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:33,710
Please sign the contract.

199
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:34,861
All right.

200
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:39,190
By the way, where are the Detective Boys?

201
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:42,440
How many times do we have to tell you?

202
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:45,451
The Detective Boys left.

203
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:48,600
Oh, that's right.

204
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:50,490
Now sign the contract.

205
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:51,801
Okay.

206
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:55,461
Is there something else?

207
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:57,540
We were just wondering...

208
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,170
...what our idols...

209
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:00,200
...the Detective Boys...

210
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:02,461
...are doing right now.

211
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:11,221
We told you, they decided to leave.

212
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:15,250
You don't need to smile like that when you're angry.

213
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:17,100
We just need to sign, right?

214
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:18,970
Just need to sign, right?

215
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:21,111
Yes, please.

216
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:25,851
No, you don't!

217
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:35,251
The Detective Boys haven't left yet!

218
00:20:36,411 --> 00:20:40,251
It's our idols, the Detective Boys!

219
00:20:42,831 --> 00:20:44,761
Ondo!

220
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:56,031
Ondo?

221
00:20:56,771 --> 00:21:00,970
Ondo-san says he likes working at Smile Village.

222
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:07,130
So he finds your plan to use the old ladies' money

223
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:12,031
you've been managing to buy a high-class hotel in Dubai...

224
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:15,241
Unforgivable.

225
00:21:21,751 --> 00:21:24,131
Ondo-sama!

226
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:28,020
You're so wonderful!

227
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:31,471
Ondo-sama! Ondo-sama!

228
00:21:35,831 --> 00:21:38,681
Ondo-sama! Ondo-sama!

229
00:23:09,091 --> 00:23:13,821
Everyone, we've almost arrived at the butcher's storefront.

230
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:19,581
The Detective Boys are eating croquettes.

231
00:23:37,191 --> 00:23:38,510
So cute!

232
00:23:38,511 --> 00:23:42,601
Chief Director Ondo-sama!

233
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:49,191
After all that time you spent, this is what you made?

234
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:52,691
We're unsuccessful because of your incompetence.

235
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:03,661
Why did the president and head of R&D have such a tense relationship?

236
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:07,881
I thought they were friends who shared the same ambition.

237
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:13,541
The next episode of Conan is "The Frying Pan of Hatred!"
