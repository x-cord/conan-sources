1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,399
Ran, the old man, and I were invited to the birthday party

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,650
of dog food company president Hinomiya Anna-san and arrived at a yacht harbor.

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,110
But then...

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,620
Right in front of us, Anna-san was shot by a masked man, who then fled the scene.

5
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,129
Anna-san's ex-boyfriend Hyodo Makoto emerged as a suspect.

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,879
Hyodo Makoto (38) Anna's Former Boyfriend

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,079
But Hyodo had an alibi. When the shooting took place,

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,010
he was robbing Anna-san's apartment, which was ten kilometers away.

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,890
However, that night...

10
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:24,143
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness!

11
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:26,043
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills!

12
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,913
The suspect dies in a shocking development!

13
00:01:27,914 --> 00:01:29,833
The truth is unclear in this shooting case!

14
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:31,463
Always determining the one truth

15
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:33,213
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

16
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:35,514
his name is Detective Conan!

17
00:03:17,194 --> 00:03:23,204
The Poodle and the Shotgun (Part Two)

18
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:36,221
If Hyodo was killed, too,

19
00:03:36,222 --> 00:03:39,552
does that mean he wasn't the murderer?

20
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:41,441
That's ridiculous!

21
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:44,021
Then who's the culprit?

22
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:46,052
Calm down, Mori-kun.

23
00:03:46,212 --> 00:03:51,062
There's no guarantee the same person killed Anna-san and Hyodo.

24
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,812
It was definitely Hyodo who killed Anna-san.

25
00:03:55,672 --> 00:03:57,962
The question is who killed Hyodo?

26
00:03:59,812 --> 00:04:01,322
Look, Detective Takagi.

27
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:03,692
What's that?

28
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:05,602
Excuse me, forensics!

29
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:14,752
Aren't those the clothes worn by the culprit who shot Anna-san?

30
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:20,702
You're right. It was definitely those.

31
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:26,722
Maybe they used that black towel as a mask.

32
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,972
What's this stain?

33
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:32,222
Maybe it's from the cake that was on the boat.

34
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:35,162
It probably stuck to them when they fled.

35
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,772
Which means the culprit, Hyodo,

36
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:42,891
hid his clothes and gun here after shooting Anna-san.

37
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:46,282
But why did he come back?

38
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:50,791
Clothes and guns are evidence that tie a culprit directly to their crime.

39
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,352
He probably intended to come back for them from the start.

40
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:57,461
Which means someone who learned of Hyodo's plan

41
00:04:57,462 --> 00:05:01,932
waited here for him and killed him.

42
00:05:06,492 --> 00:05:07,932
Inamura?

43
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:09,452
What is it?

44
00:05:09,453 --> 00:05:12,432
The name Inamura is embroidered onto the towel.

45
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:14,742
Inamura?

46
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:17,631
Does it belong to VP Inamura?

47
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:19,131
Most likely.

48
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:21,012
Inspector Megure.

49
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:26,692
Maybe you should have Inamura-san, Enami-san, and Morishima-san come back.

50
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:31,072
I'm sure one of them knows the truth.

51
00:05:31,322 --> 00:05:35,231
Thank you. We already asked the three of them to come back here.

52
00:05:35,232 --> 00:05:36,872
Takagi, make sure they've arrived.

53
00:05:37,222 --> 00:05:38,491
Yes, sir.

54
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:39,082
Hey!

55
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:43,121
You idiot, the police already know to do that!

56
00:05:43,122 --> 00:05:44,642
Right...

57
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:52,041
You sure do eat a lot.

58
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:56,582
Anna-san must have made her dog food taste like something you love.

59
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:02,102
MPD

60
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:04,177
Inamura Koshiro (45) Happywow Vice President

61
00:06:04,178 --> 00:06:07,362
Inspector, does this mean it wasn't Hyodo who killed the president?

62
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:09,312
Enami Machiko (31) Happywow Director

63
00:06:09,313 --> 00:06:11,992
No, we still believe he's a suspect.

64
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:13,982
Morishima Sota (22) Happywow Secretary

65
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:16,991
Hyodo probably came to collect the gun and clothes he hid.

66
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:20,261
He was attacked by someone when he did.

67
00:06:20,262 --> 00:06:21,431
Someone?

68
00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:23,252
Who was it?

69
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:27,832
Inamura-san, you're certain that this is your gun?

70
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,631
Please be careful!

71
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:32,682
That's an important piece of evidence.

72
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:35,341
That's definitely mine.

73
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:38,562
Was this the weapon used to kill Hyodo?

74
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:41,562
Yes. One blow to the head.

75
00:06:41,862 --> 00:06:44,942
Look. The wood is cracked.

76
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,942
They must have hit him pretty hard.

77
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:52,071
Inamura-san, do you recognize this towel?

78
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:52,862
What?

79
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:56,971
It's embroidered with the name Inamura.

80
00:06:56,972 --> 00:06:58,012
What?

81
00:06:58,742 --> 00:07:03,392
Inamura-san asked me to order this for him.

82
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:05,161
Yes.

83
00:07:05,162 --> 00:07:09,471
I had it made to commemorate a hole in one I made while golfing.

84
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:14,012
Wasn't a similar towel used to wrap the champagne?

85
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:21,522
Yes. I was also thinking about giving the towel to the president as a present.

86
00:07:21,982 --> 00:07:26,361
The culprit who shot Anna-san used this as a mask.

87
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,841
What? That's impossible.

88
00:07:28,842 --> 00:07:31,462
I haven't given out any towels yet.

89
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:33,492
You haven't?

90
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:37,061
Then how did the culprit get one?

91
00:07:37,062 --> 00:07:41,341
I know. The towel was in my car when it was stolen.

92
00:07:41,342 --> 00:07:43,372
They must have taken it from there.

93
00:07:43,602 --> 00:07:47,631
Which means Hyodo stole not only your gun from your car,

94
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:51,291
but also your towel, and used both in the crime.

95
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:53,461
It's the only explanation.

96
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:54,442
Inamura-san.

97
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:59,891
I can only imagine that you must have helped Hyodo.

98
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:03,061
You can't be serious! You think I'm his accomplice?

99
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:07,331
Once Anna-san was dead, you'd become the president.

100
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:11,572
And by killing off Hyodo, no one else would know the truth.

101
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:13,571
Am I wrong?

102
00:08:13,572 --> 00:08:16,081
You're delusional!

103
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:20,781
And Hyodo was robbing the president's apartment when she was killed!

104
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:22,692
He has an alibi!

105
00:08:23,132 --> 00:08:25,721
You can't even prove Hyodo did it!

106
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:29,252
How can you accuse me of being his accomplice?!

107
00:08:30,702 --> 00:08:34,512
When you put it that way, you're right...

108
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:38,621
Keep it together, old man.

109
00:08:38,622 --> 00:08:40,512
I've got it!

110
00:08:40,882 --> 00:08:44,751
Inspector, I've broken down Hyodo's alibi.

111
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:46,522
Really, Mori-kun?

112
00:08:47,632 --> 00:08:48,842
Morishima-san.

113
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:56,221
You said you awoke inside the locker and saw the culprit hiding in the cabin.

114
00:08:56,222 --> 00:08:57,531
Y-Yes.

115
00:08:57,532 --> 00:08:59,941
But what if you were lying?

116
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:00,782
What?

117
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:07,462
What if the culprit wasn't in the cabin in the whole time, but left to rob the apartment?

118
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:09,641
I'm not lying!

119
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:14,361
But if your testimony is false, then Hyodo's alibi is undone.

120
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:19,842
And by killing off Hyodo, you've committed the perfect crime.

121
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:26,992
Are you saying I'm Hyodo's accomplice?

122
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:32,941
Hyodo conned Anna-san out of a large sum of money.

123
00:09:32,942 --> 00:09:36,992
Perhaps he promised to give you a share.

124
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:40,451
I owe the president everything!

125
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:46,002
I could never betray her!

126
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:49,402
Morishima-kun used to be a host.

127
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,752
Anna's favorite.

128
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:54,342
A host?

129
00:09:54,732 --> 00:10:00,382
Anna dragged him out of there and offered him an especially high salary.

130
00:10:00,902 --> 00:10:03,802
Perhaps you intended to get engaged someday.

131
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:05,291
Please don't!

132
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:07,222
I've never even considered that!

133
00:10:07,492 --> 00:10:14,092
But maybe you were unsettled when you heard Anna was secretly seeing Hyodo.

134
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:17,992
I thought Hyodo and Anna-san broke up.

135
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:20,631
They were forced to.

136
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:24,242
But they secretly began meeting again.

137
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:30,002
Recently I saw Anna walking around town in a leopard-print dress.

138
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:32,382
A leopard-print dress?

139
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:38,512
I remember seeing a leopard-print dress in Anna-san's apartment.

140
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:41,531
Hyodo liked those kinds of clothes.

141
00:10:41,532 --> 00:10:45,012
So when I saw that dress, I knew immediately.

142
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:47,112
Sally-chan, wait!

143
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:49,022
Sally-chan!

144
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:53,522
Sally-chan.

145
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:56,702
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:57,022 --> 00:11:01,282
I was taking her for a walk, and she picked up some garbage.

147
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:02,662
Garbage?

148
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:05,412
It's a towel,

149
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:07,662
embroidered with the name Inamura.

150
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:09,162
What?

151
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:12,672
It's all clear now.

152
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:14,481
Two towels.

153
00:11:14,482 --> 00:11:16,421
What's the meaning of this?

154
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:18,552
I don't know either.

155
00:11:18,822 --> 00:11:21,321
Mori-kun, what does this mean?

156
00:11:21,322 --> 00:11:23,312
What? Well...

157
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:30,472
Dad!

158
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:36,342
Th-The Sleeping Kogoro!

159
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:42,241
Inspector, first we must prove

160
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:47,792
that it was Hyodo who killed Anna-san.

161
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:49,431
Detective Takagi.

162
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:50,681
Yes?

163
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:52,921
Could you bring those shoes over here?

164
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:53,992
Yes.

165
00:11:57,322 --> 00:12:00,002
These are the shoes Hyodo was wearing.

166
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:05,071
Yesterday night, Sally-chan jumped on Hyodo's legs.

167
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:08,112
That proves the culprit was Hyodo.

168
00:12:10,242 --> 00:12:15,982
There was dog food scattered all over the cabin in which the culprit hid.

169
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:22,231
And the culprit, in other words, Hyodo, stepped on the dog food with those shoes.

170
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:25,742
Sally-chan reacted to that smell.

171
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:33,452
That's it. Because I fell in dog food on the boat

172
00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:37,422
Sally-chan bit my butt.

173
00:12:39,632 --> 00:12:43,132
Inamura-san, that dog food is an original product, isn't it?

174
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:44,312
Yes.

175
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:47,892
It's a new product that uses a special fragrance not used by any other company.

176
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:52,231
If you analyze the fragments stuck to the bottom of these shoes,

177
00:12:52,232 --> 00:12:55,892
you'll find Hyodo was in the cabin before shooting Anna-san.

178
00:12:56,452 --> 00:13:00,901
In other words, it proves he shot Anna-san.

179
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:07,681
Mori-kun, then who was robbing Anna-san's apartment at the same time?

180
00:13:07,682 --> 00:13:10,601
Hyodo's accomplice, of course.

181
00:13:10,602 --> 00:13:11,912
His accomplice?

182
00:13:12,552 --> 00:13:16,411
Unfortunately, they're already dead.

183
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:17,792
Dead?

184
00:13:30,612 --> 00:13:32,402
C-Could it be?

185
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:34,146
Anna-san herself?

186
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:40,902
That's right. Hyodo's accomplice was the murdered Anna-san.

187
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:47,412
Morishima-san, before coming to the party, did Anna-san go to a nail salon?

188
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:49,531
Yes. She always does.

189
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:53,662
She loved wearing differently colored nails every day.

190
00:13:54,152 --> 00:14:01,342
But there were thin scratches on the nails of Anna-san's body.

191
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:07,091
I found it strange that she showed up to a party with scratched nails,

192
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:11,352
but the truth was revealed by the pet camera footage.

193
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:15,782
Her nails were scratched when Sally-chan jumped on her.

194
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:23,622
If you examine Sally-chan's nails, you'll find nail polish matching Anna-san's nails.

195
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:30,992
But why would the victim Anna-san be his accomplice?

196
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:37,962
Naturally, Anna-san didn't believe she would be killed either.

197
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:46,132
What Anna-san wanted was to kill her vice president Inamura-san.

198
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:48,722
What?

199
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:50,811
Why Inamura-san?

200
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:56,702
Anna-san feared that Inamura-san would take over her company.

201
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:59,011
Take over?

202
00:14:59,012 --> 00:15:02,652
It's true that Anna feared Inamura-san.

203
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:05,411
Since she was new to management,

204
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:09,992
when the veteran Inamura-san interjected, she couldn't protest.

205
00:15:10,232 --> 00:15:13,921
Honestly, I heard her complain about it more than once.

206
00:15:13,922 --> 00:15:19,622
She thought Inamura-san only thought of her as an advertisement.

207
00:15:19,872 --> 00:15:21,501
She's wrong!

208
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:24,931
I intended to support her for as long as I could!

209
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:27,632
I've never even thought of taking over the company!

210
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:31,981
Inamura-san, I believe you.

211
00:15:31,982 --> 00:15:34,892
But Hyodo was a dyed-in-the-wool conman.

212
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:41,402
It was easy for him to talk her into a murder plot.

213
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:46,902
But isn't that just your deduction—your imagination?

214
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:48,511
No.

215
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:53,871
Didn't you know that Hyodo used his silver tongue

216
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:57,912
to talk Anna-san into being his accomplice, Enami-san?

217
00:15:59,202 --> 00:16:00,792
Why me?

218
00:16:01,032 --> 00:16:05,802
Detective Takagi, show Enami-san the pet camera footage.

219
00:16:06,062 --> 00:16:07,302
Got it.

220
00:16:08,722 --> 00:16:11,552
You lied about Anna-san wearing the leopard-print dress

221
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:16,182
after seeing the pet camera footage.

222
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:17,772
I wasn't lying!

223
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:21,692
I really did see her walking around town in this dress!

224
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:23,901
That's odd.

225
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:25,442
Hey, Conan!

226
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:26,942
Here.

227
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:31,952
She just bought that dress and hadn't worn it outside yet.

228
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:35,231
After all, when I looked under the hem yesterday,

229
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:37,411
the price tag was still on it.

230
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:40,461
You were probably lying about her walking around in it.

231
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:42,002
So, what?

232
00:16:42,592 --> 00:16:46,712
You're accusing me of being an accomplice just because I made a mistake?

233
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,431
Hold on.

234
00:16:48,432 --> 00:16:53,012
The president and Hyodo were planning to kill me, weren't they?

235
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:54,461
That's right.

236
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:59,772
But that was a fake plot intended to have Anna-san fabricate Hyodo's alibi.

237
00:17:00,342 --> 00:17:04,152
Hyodo's real aim was to kill Anna-san from the start.

238
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:07,531
And Enami-san knew about it.

239
00:17:07,532 --> 00:17:09,201
You're still saying that?

240
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:11,582
It's the only explanation.

241
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,361
Before I explain why,

242
00:17:14,362 --> 00:17:19,932
you must know about another major trick.

243
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:22,412
A major trick?

244
00:17:23,112 --> 00:17:28,542
Enami-san, you were working with Hyodo from the start.

245
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:31,302
You're lying!

246
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:36,922
Then how do you explain the watch on your wrist?

247
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:42,642
Morishima-san, isn't that the watch

248
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:49,272
you bought for Anna-san at Enami-san's request?

249
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:52,461
Yes. I noticed when I saw it.

250
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:54,531
I thought she bought herself the same thing.

251
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,931
That's right. I already owned this one.

252
00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:00,202
I gave Anna her present.

253
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:04,461
But since she was shot immediately, I don't know what happened to it.

254
00:18:04,462 --> 00:18:05,801
No.

255
00:18:05,802 --> 00:18:08,882
You knew Anna-san would be shot.

256
00:18:10,612 --> 00:18:14,672
That's why you brought an empty box.

257
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:23,432
You must've thought it would be a waste to break such an expensive watch.

258
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:27,692
That doesn't prove I was working with Hyodo!

259
00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:30,942
Then why did you kill Hyodo?

260
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:38,432
When Detective Takagi showed Inamura-san the shotgun, you said something.

261
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,101
Look. The wood is cracked.

262
00:18:41,102 --> 00:18:43,562
They must have hit him pretty hard.

263
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:48,212
None of us said he was bludgeoned to death.

264
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,222
That...

265
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:55,461
That detective said he took one shot to the head.

266
00:18:55,462 --> 00:19:00,472
Normally a person would assume one blow to the head with a gun meant the victim was shot.

267
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,662
They wouldn't think he was bludgeoned.

268
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:06,982
Not only that, but you accurately identified the section used to strike him.

269
00:19:07,402 --> 00:19:11,982
When Hyodo came to the boat where the gun and clothes were hidden,

270
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:26,502
you swung the shotgun down on Hyodo, killing him.

271
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:33,891
You saw Hyodo remove his mask as he was fleeing.

272
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:38,201
He probably removed it unconsciously because he had trouble breathing.

273
00:19:38,202 --> 00:19:43,401
But you needed that towel to convince us

274
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:45,921
that Inamura-san killed Hyodo.

275
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:52,161
That's why you picked up the fallen towel from the deck and hid it with the culprit's clothes.

276
00:19:52,162 --> 00:19:55,272
You're the only one who could've done it.

277
00:19:57,082 --> 00:20:00,782
The towel you picked up should smell like champagne.

278
00:20:01,422 --> 00:20:04,571
But because Hyodo used his cake-coated hand

279
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:10,551
to remove the real towel from his face, it had to have cake on it.

280
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:14,602
And that's the towel Sally-chan brought us.

281
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:23,012
With Anna-san and Hyodo killed, if Inamura-san was arrested,

282
00:20:23,492 --> 00:20:26,221
the company would be yours and yours alone.

283
00:20:26,222 --> 00:20:28,932
Enami-san, you're the culprit!

284
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:41,072
Stop, Enami-san!

285
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:43,701
You're lying! You're making it up!

286
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:44,872
Stop!

287
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:46,202
Don't!

288
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:53,922
Sally-chan!

289
00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:03,052
We emptied it. This is the end.

290
00:21:06,452 --> 00:21:08,732
It's okay, Sally-chan.

291
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:18,072
I can't believe my plans were ruined by a poodle.

292
00:21:18,302 --> 00:21:21,332
Why did you choose to work with Hyodo?

293
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:24,702
You didn't have to kill Anna-san.

294
00:21:25,142 --> 00:21:27,272
That company is mine.

295
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:30,332
I should've been president!

296
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:34,712
Even if I hadn't worked with Hyodo, I still would've killed Anna!

297
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:15,272
Mori Detective Agency

298
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:18,731
They found a new owner for Sally-chan.

299
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:19,981
That's great news.

300
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:24,422
Yeah. We were this close to having to look after her.

301
00:23:25,282 --> 00:23:27,652
I would've been okay with that.

302
00:23:27,912 --> 00:23:32,482
You idiot, dogs are too much trouble to take care of.

303
00:23:33,062 --> 00:23:34,172
Besides—

304
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:38,202
What? Isn't this dog food?!

305
00:23:44,412 --> 00:23:45,412
Yoshida-san.

306
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:47,051
What's the matter?

307
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:48,322
That woman...

308
00:23:49,752 --> 00:23:51,621
She seems sort of sad.

309
00:23:51,622 --> 00:23:52,432
Yeah.

310
00:23:52,902 --> 00:23:56,932
Kajiki Kohei-san... you're a company president.

311
00:23:57,222 --> 00:24:00,562
I manufacture and sell men's cosmetics.

312
00:24:03,152 --> 00:24:04,192
What?

313
00:24:08,312 --> 00:24:12,282
The next episode of Conan is "Miss Lonely and the Detective Boys!"
