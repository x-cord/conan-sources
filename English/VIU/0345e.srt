1
00:01:01,832 --> 00:01:03,432
Cool kid.

2
00:01:34,332 --> 00:01:35,631
No way!

3
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:36,832
How?

4
00:01:40,732 --> 00:01:42,832
Stop! Calvados!

5
00:01:45,232 --> 00:01:46,832
Could it be...

6
00:01:49,132 --> 00:01:50,432
she saw everything?

7
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:07,332
Stop! Calvados!

8
00:02:17,632 --> 00:02:18,932
Stop!

9
00:02:28,332 --> 00:02:30,332
Can't you hear I'm telling you to stop?

10
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:53,631
So...

11
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,432
Get away from that brown-haired girl!

12
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:01,031
If you don't want to die, you'd better hurry!

13
00:03:01,032 --> 00:03:03,331
No! Don't move!

14
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:05,832
Come on. Hurry! Get out of the way!

15
00:03:08,432 --> 00:03:09,632
Stop it!

16
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:12,731
I called the police.

17
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:15,232
So just put up with this a while longer. Please!

18
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,532
Big sis.

19
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:34,131
Silver hair?

20
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:36,831
The story was meant to end this way.

21
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,232
Hate God for what is happening to you.

22
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:51,631
What are you doing?

23
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,131
Hurry and hang on to my arm!

24
00:03:54,132 --> 00:03:57,131
Hurry or my arm will get slippery from the rain.

25
00:03:57,132 --> 00:03:59,331
Why'd you save me?

26
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:01,232
Why on earth?

27
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:06,831
Who needs a reason?

28
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:08,531
Who cares what the motives are

29
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:10,331
for a person to want to kill another person?

30
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:12,532
Why would a person want to save another then?

31
00:04:13,832 --> 00:04:16,632
There is no logical reason for that either, is there?

32
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:30,232
Get out of the way!

33
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:37,631
What are you doing?

34
00:04:37,632 --> 00:04:40,232
Hurry and hang on to my arm!

35
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:45,332
Move it, Angel!

36
00:04:52,932 --> 00:04:54,032
What?

37
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:01,131
This is a blind spot for the rifle.

38
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:03,031
When did you...

39
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:04,632
Throw your gun down.

40
00:05:05,832 --> 00:05:07,931
Throw your gun down!

41
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,232
If not, I'll aim for your head next.

42
00:05:17,532 --> 00:05:19,231
The sound of a pump?

43
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:20,531
A shotgun?

44
00:05:20,532 --> 00:05:22,931
Okay! Calvados.

45
00:05:22,932 --> 00:05:24,532
We'll attack them from both sides!

46
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:29,531
This is bad.

47
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:30,732
He's coming from behind.

48
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:49,831
Come on, Calvados.

49
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:52,731
Use that dear shotgun of yours

50
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:56,032
and blow up the little kitty FBI agent, will you?

51
00:05:57,632 --> 00:06:01,832
So, his name is Calvados.

52
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:08,032
A rifle, a shotgun and three guns.

53
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:13,232
I thought he was a weapon vendor or something.

54
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,231
Shuichi Akai?

55
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:18,031
Shu!

56
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:20,431
But with two broken legs,

57
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:23,032
I don't think he'll be doing business for quite some time.

58
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:33,531
Well, Calvados is like a strong apple spirit.

59
00:06:33,532 --> 00:06:34,931
So, I guess he's just right

60
00:06:34,932 --> 00:06:37,331
for the partner of a rotten apple like you.

61
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:39,931
Rotten apple?

62
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,531
That's the name we call you by.

63
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:45,231
Golden Apple was the stage

64
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:48,231
in which the great actress Sharon stole the limelight.

65
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:51,531
You're just as beautiful now as you were back then but...

66
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:55,431
Inside, you're a wrinkled up rotten apple.

67
00:06:55,432 --> 00:06:57,832
A really rotten apple!

68
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,431
Don't, Shu!

69
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:17,231
Don't worry.

70
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:19,531
I can tell from the way she moves

71
00:07:19,532 --> 00:07:22,131
that she's wearing a bullet proof jacket

72
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:24,531
and layers of bullet proof pads all over her body.

73
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:27,032
I think she'll get two or three broken ribs at most.

74
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:29,931
Moreover, look.

75
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:32,531
Look at her face that tore apart with the shot that was fired.

76
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:36,832
That's the face of that woman with no make-up after all.

77
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,232
The brats are a nuisance!

78
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:57,932
Cool kid.

79
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:40,731
To think she can blow up the gasoline tank

80
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:42,832
by looking over the mirror in that situation.

81
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:52,231
She's pretty good.

82
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,531
Shu!

83
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:55,631
This is no time to be amazed by her!

84
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:59,431
She took a child hostage and got away, you know?

85
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:02,132
Then why didn't you take the key out of the car?

86
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:06,031
Well, I'm sorry.

87
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:07,831
We did get our share though,

88
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:10,232
because that woman's comrade is...

89
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:14,531
Hey...

90
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:17,731
Don't tell me he still had a gun on him?

91
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:19,632
Could it be that he killed himself?

92
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:23,931
Look at that.

93
00:09:23,932 --> 00:09:26,432
The Japanese police are here.

94
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:32,231
This girl must've called them.

95
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:34,231
Inside the trunk,

96
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:35,831
it's hard to make out conversation

97
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:38,131
but bullets can be heard.

98
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:39,231
I'm sure

99
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:42,231
she saw the pictures in my room and got suspicious,

100
00:09:42,232 --> 00:09:44,231
and snuck inside my car

101
00:09:44,232 --> 00:09:46,132
in order to investigate me.

102
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:51,131
She heard the bullets and came outside.

103
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:55,931
Then protected the brown haired girl, who had a gun pointed at her.

104
00:09:55,932 --> 00:09:59,131
They probably thought they were shot

105
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,431
and both passed out.

106
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:04,131
Geez.

107
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:07,431
I don't know if you can say they got guts or not.

108
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:10,731
Then, I'll leave the rest up to you.

109
00:10:10,732 --> 00:10:12,331
Just go ahead and explain to them that

110
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:14,131
you're an FBI agent on a long leave of absence came to Japan

111
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:17,832
and got mixed up in a child kidnapping case.

112
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:22,231
Since that woman got away,

113
00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:27,031
nobody would believe anything we say anyway.

114
00:10:27,032 --> 00:10:30,431
The big guy behind all this hasn't come up front yet.

115
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:32,731
And besides I can't have

116
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:37,432
that girl with the brown hair see me yet.

117
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:12,431
"Seems that I gave you too much freedom before."

118
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:15,531
"Return to me immediately, Vermouth."

119
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:18,332
Okay, boss.

120
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:26,532
Now...

121
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,831
This child.

122
00:11:28,832 --> 00:11:30,431
What shall do with this child who thinks

123
00:11:30,432 --> 00:11:32,932
he is capable of doing everything?

124
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:54,332
The electrodes of an ECG monitor?

125
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:58,431
There is a tracing device as well as a recorder.

126
00:11:58,432 --> 00:11:59,831
Don't tell me that

127
00:11:59,832 --> 00:12:02,031
the sound of the telephone I made just a while ago was.

128
00:12:02,032 --> 00:12:04,731
Don't.

129
00:12:04,732 --> 00:12:06,531
If you pull that out,

130
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:09,331
it means that my heart has stopped

131
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:12,331
and the mail address of the boss you sent an e-mail to

132
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:15,631
will be disclosed to my friend.

133
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:19,231
The telephone company must protect the privacy of their clients.

134
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:20,631
But the police

135
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:24,131
can get that information if they fill out a special form

136
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:26,531
and have one of the higher-ups put a seal on it,

137
00:12:26,532 --> 00:12:29,831
then have the information disclosed before several witnesses.

138
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,731
If the call that was received was not from a cell phone,

139
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:36,631
but a regular home phone, even the address would be disclosed!

140
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:37,731
In other words,

141
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:39,331
if the sound just now is recorded

142
00:12:39,332 --> 00:12:42,731
and analyzed to decipher the alphabets and number,

143
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:47,231
the name of your boss, as well as his whereabouts can be tracked down!

144
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:49,731
That is, even if I were to be killed!

145
00:12:49,732 --> 00:12:50,831
Well,

146
00:12:50,832 --> 00:12:53,831
I did figure that if you found Sherry,

147
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:57,231
who you guys are going nuts looking for,

148
00:12:57,232 --> 00:13:01,332
you would unmistakably contact your big boss.

149
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,431
Since things began to look dangerous for Ms. Jodie,

150
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:08,132
I had to change my plans.

151
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:11,632
So, what are you going to do now?

152
00:13:14,332 --> 00:13:16,131
My friends are waiting for contact from me

153
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:19,032
at a distant place from here.

154
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:24,531
If you don't want this to go out,

155
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:26,731
take me to your boss!

156
00:13:26,732 --> 00:13:30,032
Let's get things over with once and for all, Vermouth!

157
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:34,332
I want to stop playing hide-and-seek already!

158
00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:40,931
Okay.

159
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:42,631
I lost.

160
00:13:42,632 --> 00:13:45,032
I'll give up going after Sherry.

161
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,531
It's mere sleeping gas.

162
00:13:55,532 --> 00:13:57,131
You idiot!

163
00:13:57,132 --> 00:13:59,531
If you do something like this, you'll suck in the gas too.

164
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:02,831
Yes. This is a gamble.

165
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:04,831
If you get up first,

166
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:07,531
you go ahead and call the police and have me arrested,

167
00:14:07,532 --> 00:14:11,231
then go raid the boss along with them.

168
00:14:11,232 --> 00:14:14,331
You already know what happens

169
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:16,032
if I get up first, don't you?

170
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,432
Bad news!

171
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:24,531
I've got to go wake him up right away.

172
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:25,832
Shinichi!

173
00:14:30,832 --> 00:14:36,532
Shinichi...

174
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:07,631
You guys were blasted by Shuichi Akai?

175
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:09,631
Yes.

176
00:16:09,632 --> 00:16:11,431
He just happened to find us by,

177
00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:14,531
and Calvados ended up with three broken ribs.

178
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:18,131
You mean that FBI agent that you failed to get rid of

179
00:16:18,132 --> 00:16:20,331
back in New York a year ago,

180
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:24,331
when you disguised yourself as serial killer.

181
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:26,031
I thought he'd be off his guard if he figured

182
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:28,732
I was just an ordinary killer, but...

183
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:33,631
I should've gotten rid of him back then

184
00:16:33,632 --> 00:16:36,132
even if I had to risk being killed myself.

185
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:56,131
Our boss said that

186
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:58,731
that person

187
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:02,832
could be our silver bullet.

188
00:17:04,332 --> 00:17:06,832
He is to be feared.

189
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:14,831
A silver bullet that capable to kill us in one shot

190
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:16,831
doesn't exist.

191
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:20,531
At any rate, I'm in a phone booth on route 20,

192
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:22,831
so can you come pick me up?

193
00:17:22,832 --> 00:17:26,231
I got into a bit of trouble,

194
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:27,931
and can't move.

195
00:17:27,932 --> 00:17:31,532
Before that, I have something I want to ask you.

196
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:36,832
Do you know a kid by the name of Shinichi Kudo?

197
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:41,831
No.

198
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:43,531
I don't.

199
00:17:43,532 --> 00:17:45,832
Why did you save me?

200
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:50,031
Who needs a reason?

201
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:52,331
Why would a person want to save another then?

202
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:55,832
There is no logical reason for that either, is there?

203
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:01,332
Yes, it's him.

204
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:10,231
He, the one who pierced through our heart,

205
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:12,032
could prove to be him.

206
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:25,731
The one that we have long awaited,

207
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:27,732
the silver bullet.

208
00:18:32,932 --> 00:18:35,431
"Next Episode."

209
00:18:35,432 --> 00:18:37,231
At any rate, we'll have to figure out

210
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:40,831
what this mark that Ayumi drew is.

211
00:18:40,832 --> 00:18:42,032
Hey!

212
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:47,032
The mark on Genta's butt sure looks familiar.

213
00:18:57,432 --> 00:18:58,731
Next Conan,

214
00:18:58,732 --> 00:19:02,932
"Look for the Mark on the Buttocks (Part 1)"
