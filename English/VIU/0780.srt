1
00:00:00,711 --> 00:00:03,810
As I was warning FBI agent Jodie

2
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:06,910
that member of the Organization, Bourbon alias Tohru Amuro,

3
00:00:06,911 --> 00:00:10,510
who was searching around about Rikumichi Kusuda,

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,910
we were informed that her friend, Ms. Natsuko Shibuya,

5
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:15,911
was pushed down some stairs.

6
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:19,210
We rushed over to the crime scene

7
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:21,710
only to find out that she wasn't attacked at the stairs

8
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:25,310
but rather at the elementary school where she worked.

9
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:27,910
Three suspects were also summoned to come.

10
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:29,711
And, furthermore...

11
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:37,010
She asked me to solve a stalker problem for her you see.

12
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:39,510
Bourbon?

13
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:43,311
And are those two over there English teachers?

14
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,910
No. They are FBI agents

15
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:52,010
and are cooperating with us with the investigation.

16
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:54,210
Oh.

17
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:57,410
The FBI?

18
00:00:57,411 --> 00:01:01,410
In other words, the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States.

19
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:05,210
I see a lot about you on TV or in the movies.

20
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:11,410
Their investigators show up at crime scenes to steal all the credit,

21
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:12,510
smugly interfere with the investigation,

22
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:16,510
offend the local police and annoy the viewer.

23
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:18,310
What?

24
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:22,110
I'm not referring to any of you, though!

25
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:25,910
-I just happened to see what I talked of. -This guy...

26
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:29,511
This guy tried to kill Akai.

27
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:33,410
Camel.

28
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:34,510
Cool it.

29
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,210
You don't want him to find out that

30
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:39,210
the FBI knows that he's a member of the Black Organization, do you?

31
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:40,911
Okay.

32
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:49,710
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

33
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:52,010
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

34
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,710
Although Amuro's remark is of concern,

35
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:55,510
solving the test answer sheet comes first!

36
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:57,110
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:59,110
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:01,311
His name is Detective Conan!

39
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:46,288
"The Scarlet Pursuit"

40
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:49,287
Like I said a moment ago.

41
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:51,987
I was really in the PE equipment room

42
00:03:51,988 --> 00:03:56,087
organizing things until after 8:30 pm.

43
00:03:56,088 --> 00:03:57,587
"Yoshiharu Sugamoto (30)" -Since it's late,

44
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:02,687
I came to this teachers room to get her so we can go home together,

45
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,187
but she wasn't here.

46
00:04:04,188 --> 00:04:07,787
Did you tell Ms. Shibuya that you were going to walk her home?

47
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:08,887
Oh, no.

48
00:04:08,888 --> 00:04:11,887
I just thought that she'd feel safer if a guy was with her

49
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:13,987
walking the streets at night.

50
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,887
Come to think of it,

51
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,387
you confessed your love to Ms. Shibuya some time ago

52
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:21,687
and seem to have been brushed off then, no?

53
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:24,087
Did she tell you about it?

54
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:27,787
No. I heard about it from the other teachers.

55
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:29,887
Back when I visited here

56
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:34,487
after Ms. Shibuya asked me to investigate on a stalker for her.

57
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:38,287
That's why you were on my blacklist.

58
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:41,587
Don't tell me you were the one who was stalking Natsuko?

59
00:04:41,588 --> 00:04:42,987
No, it's the other way around!

60
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:46,487
I was the one protecting her from the dangerous guys.

61
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:47,887
Protecting her?

62
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:48,888
Yes.

63
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,387
I guarded her almost every day

64
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:54,387
to see that she got home safely, you see.

65
00:04:54,388 --> 00:04:56,387
But actually, I followed her

66
00:04:56,388 --> 00:05:02,687
without her knowing and quietly watched over her.

67
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:07,287
Sometimes she would sense my presence and look around.

68
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:09,787
It was cute.

69
00:05:09,788 --> 00:05:12,887
I would really get the feeling of having to protect her.

70
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:15,787
That's what you call a stalker!

71
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:19,187
Don't tell me that she accused you of that and you got angry...

72
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:21,687
No way!

73
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:25,587
It's true she really wasn't here after 8:30 pm!

74
00:05:25,588 --> 00:05:30,387
Besides, already graded the test sheets were in her bag, right?

75
00:05:30,388 --> 00:05:33,387
Since I'm a teacher just like her,

76
00:05:33,388 --> 00:05:36,987
I would know better than to take home something like that!

77
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:38,487
Test papers?

78
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:41,687
"Akiyo Ueno (39)" -When I came here to see her last night,

79
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:44,487
she was busily grading papers.

80
00:05:44,488 --> 00:05:48,687
I'll bet she just let my words go by.

81
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:49,987
I see.

82
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:52,887
By the way, you mentioned that

83
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:56,387
you came to see Ms. Shibuya to ask her not to seduce your son.

84
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:57,987
But what grade is your son in?

85
00:05:57,988 --> 00:06:02,487
I think he's in first grade just like Conan.

86
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:07,787
Because Natsuko told me that she was the homeroom teacher of class 1-C.

87
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:11,187
In love with his homeroom teacher in the first grade.

88
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:12,487
How cute!

89
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:16,187
Cut out the gibberish!

90
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:18,587
Gibberish?

91
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:22,587
Because he's still mentally immature and at a sensitive age,

92
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:25,987
I warned her to act more modestly.

93
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:30,587
And my son is in the fifth grade, not the first!

94
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:31,588
-What? -What?

95
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:34,887
You mean he's in love with a teacher from another grade?

96
00:06:34,888 --> 00:06:38,787
Ms. Shibuya is fluent in English

97
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:40,887
because she studied abroad for quite a while.

98
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:44,787
Therefore, she taught English to the upper grades too.

99
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:46,187
I see.

100
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:48,587
He's just like my husband I divorced!

101
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:51,887
He went head over heels over a cosmopolitan girl that he met at a cabaret.

102
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:53,887
After dished out money for her, he was abandoned by her.

103
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:59,087
That's why I don't want my son to end up like him!

104
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:04,387
Still everyone around him is trying to drag him down.

105
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:05,787
Drag him down?

106
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:09,287
I'm sorry, will somebody lend me a handkerchief?

107
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:12,687
I forgot it in the cab on my way here.

108
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:15,287
If you don't mind using mine, here.

109
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:16,387
Thank you.

110
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:18,087
A cab,

111
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:19,987
which means you don't have a car?

112
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:23,887
I sold it to pay for the debts of my husband!

113
00:07:23,888 --> 00:07:27,487
Although I still renew my driver's license.

114
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,687
It was stolen?

115
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:31,587
You mean the car you owned?

116
00:07:31,588 --> 00:07:32,687
Yeah.

117
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:35,287
When I was ready to go the company this morning,

118
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,287
"Fujiyuki Kandachi (41)" -I found that my garage had been broken into

119
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:39,087
and my car was gone.

120
00:07:39,088 --> 00:07:40,487
Did you report the car theft?

121
00:07:40,488 --> 00:07:42,087
I did, right away!

122
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:46,687
So, I had to take the train to work and come here by bus.

123
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:49,487
I also end up being a suspect for a murder case.

124
00:07:49,488 --> 00:07:50,887
Talk about bummers.

125
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,787
Natsuko's still alive, you know.

126
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:56,487
Hold on. You can't smoke here!

127
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:57,887
Oh, okay.

128
00:07:57,888 --> 00:07:58,888
If I remember correctly,

129
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:01,987
you said you came here last night a little before 9 pm?

130
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:04,287
Yeah. Like I said before,

131
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:07,987
when I came here the school building was dark and the gate was closed.

132
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,887
She was probably already carried away

133
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:14,887
by that stalker teacher or that old lady, though.

134
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:19,387
It's also thinkable that you carried Ms. Shibuya away

135
00:08:19,388 --> 00:08:22,287
after Mrs. Ueno went home and before Mr. Sugamoto arrived.

136
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:23,987
Oh, I guess so.

137
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:29,287
Anyway, I came here as promised but that teacher wasn't here.

138
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:33,787
Then, you're saying you promised to see Ms. Shibuya at around 9 pm?

139
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:35,087
Yeah.

140
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:40,987
But we found an unsent text mail in Ms. Shibuya's cell phone that said,

141
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:43,887
"The time promised is 20:30, but are you coming?"

142
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:46,187
Wasn't this mail supposed to be sent to you?

143
00:08:46,188 --> 00:08:47,887
How should I know?

144
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:48,987
Since you're asking me that,

145
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:51,287
it didn't have the sender she was addressing it to, did it?

146
00:08:51,288 --> 00:08:53,687
Maybe she was going to send it to that old lady,

147
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:58,687
who came in as she was writing it?

148
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:01,787
Well, even if that mail was meant to be sent to me that is...

149
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:03,687
Maybe she was all confused

150
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:06,687
looking at additions and subtractions that she made a mistake!

151
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:09,588
After all since it seems that she was grading the test papers.

152
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:16,187
Are these the test papers in question?

153
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,287
Yes.

154
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:18,487
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:21,187
The actual test papers are with the forensics right now

156
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:24,187
so all we have now are those photos.

157
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,587
But even if the problems are simple,

158
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:28,687
if there are this many figures lined out,

159
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:30,887
it's understandable that she'd get confused, right?

160
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:32,687
See?

161
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:35,687
But, what Natsuko was saying was true then.

162
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:37,187
-What? -See.

163
00:09:37,188 --> 00:09:39,787
The illustration on the top right.

164
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:44,687
In the States, when 100 is scored, we write "Excellent",

165
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:47,687
but she said that in Japan, a flower circle is drawn.

166
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:48,787
Oh.

167
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:49,887
Is that all?

168
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:53,387
-What? -Is that all, FBI?

169
00:09:53,388 --> 00:09:54,987
What do you mean is that all?

170
00:09:54,988 --> 00:09:57,687
How about you, German descent?

171
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:00,087
I'm asking you is that all the information

172
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:02,788
you can come up with from this photo?

173
00:10:07,988 --> 00:10:11,187
It seems that in Japan they mark the correct answers with a circle.

174
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:15,588
The score on the very top test paper is all correct.

175
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:22,487
It seems that we were the only ones who could decipher it after all!

176
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,187
-"We"? -"We"?

177
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:26,787
Right?

178
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:28,587
Conan Edogawa?

179
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:30,687
What're you talking about?

180
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:34,187
After you looked at the photos, you were staring at him.

181
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:36,287
The perpetrator.

182
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:37,787
What? Then...

183
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:40,087
Have you figured it out who the perpetrator is?

184
00:10:40,088 --> 00:10:41,887
Yes. More or less.

185
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:45,687
But the mystery's finally been solved.

186
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:48,487
I was wondering all this time.

187
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:50,887
Why she asked me, a detective,

188
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:53,787
to investigate on a stalker

189
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:57,587
despite having an FBI friend like you?

190
00:10:57,588 --> 00:10:59,587
Hey, just what do you mean by that?

191
00:10:59,588 --> 00:11:01,687
Are you calling me unreliable?

192
00:11:01,688 --> 00:11:04,287
Maybe she found it hard to ask us?

193
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,787
After all, we're here on a sightseeing tour.

194
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:10,187
I see. You're on a sightseeing tour.

195
00:11:10,188 --> 00:11:11,387
If you don't have visas,

196
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:15,587
I'm sure your duration of stay is almost up?

197
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:17,487
If you had your fill of touring,

198
00:11:17,488 --> 00:11:20,388
I hope you'd hurry and get out of here.

199
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:24,688
From my Japan.

200
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:29,687
Can I have a word with you, Zero.

201
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,188
I mean Amuro. Give me a sec.

202
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:38,888
Well...

203
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:41,587
Amuro,

204
00:11:41,588 --> 00:11:44,487
you're the enemies, right?

205
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:46,488
With the bad guys.

206
00:11:55,988 --> 00:11:57,787
Zero.

207
00:11:57,788 --> 00:12:03,287
My nickname when I was a child was really that.

208
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:08,188
It seems that you've got me wrong a bit.

209
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:12,688
Got you wrong?

210
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:21,175
Shall we start solving the puzzle then?

211
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,674
First of all, please take a good look at the photos of the test papers

212
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:27,674
you saw a while ago.

213
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:29,575
Don't you notice something?

214
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:33,774
I've got him wrong?

215
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:38,074
His insight at seeing through the truth of a case in an instant.

216
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:41,775
That action of his in the Bell Tree Express of not killing Haibara.

217
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,375
His attitude of reacting to the word "Zero".

218
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:52,674
And now I'm more convinced

219
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:55,674
by his remark to the FBI agents a while ago.

220
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,975
I hope you'd hurry and get out of here.

221
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:00,875
From my Japan.

222
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:04,274
That conviction of his!

223
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:05,474
"Zero" is a code name meaning,

224
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:09,674
"Remain a non-existing organization".

225
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:14,574
The organization that exists to maintain the peace and order of Japan.

226
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:17,374
It's a common name given to the security police.

227
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,674
If he's from the security police

228
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:20,474
and infiltrating the Organization,

229
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:21,874
I thought that we could avoid the worse

230
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:25,474
if I explained our situation but...

231
00:13:25,475 --> 00:13:26,975
If that's not the case...

232
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:30,675
This plan that I've thought carefully over for some time.

233
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:37,774
And? How about it, Mr. Akai?

234
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,374
Sink or swim, this is a great gamble.

235
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,174
Would you like to go for it?

236
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:43,375
Of course.

237
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,074
We'll be exposed!

238
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:50,874
Hold it. Cool it.

239
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,074
It hasn't been exposed yet.

240
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:56,774
There's just one piece of information he doesn't know of yet.

241
00:13:56,775 --> 00:14:00,175
I'm sure that he'll conjure up something to get a hold of it.

242
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,275
But, what on earth could it be?

243
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:11,274
I give up, Amuro.

244
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:12,774
Tell me won't you?

245
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:15,774
What is strange about this test paper?

246
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:17,874
Please look at it closely!

247
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,974
Look at the answers on the topmost test paper

248
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:24,174
and the answers on the paper hidden below it.

249
00:14:24,175 --> 00:14:26,474
For example this "4+5"

250
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:28,374
the answer is the same "9"

251
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,574
and yet the sheet on top is marked with a circle

252
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:30,974
and the one below is marked with a check mark.

253
00:14:30,975 --> 00:14:34,574
Besides, this test sheet of a student named Fumihiko Hirai

254
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:35,974
is marked everywhere with check marks

255
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,174
and yet has a flower circle and a score of 100 on it.

256
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:41,174
Don't you think it's strange?

257
00:14:41,175 --> 00:14:43,774
True.

258
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:45,274
Wait a second.

259
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:46,374
Hold it...

260
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:49,874
It's impossible that the FBI and Bourbon, a member of the Organization,

261
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53,574
would run into each other coincidentally at the crime scene to begin with.

262
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:56,775
The clincher was, if I remember correctly...

263
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,775
Ms. Jodie.

264
00:15:04,975 --> 00:15:05,975
What?

265
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:09,474
Why did you call Ms. Shibuya last night?

266
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,074
Because I was had promised to go drinking with her.

267
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:13,874
Who invited who?

268
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,874
She texted me to go.

269
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,274
But, it's strange

270
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:20,174
because Natsuko said she didn't remember texting me about it.

271
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:23,974
Well, it seems that mail was in her cell phone,

272
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:26,074
and she's a bit of a scatterbrain anyway so...

273
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:29,274
Your cell phone needed to be recharged, right?

274
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:31,974
So Agent Camel, you lent her your cell phone, right?

275
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:33,574
Yeah.

276
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:35,574
I recharge it every night,

277
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:37,074
but since I use it so frequently,

278
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:40,174
at about sundown it runs out of battery.

279
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:43,074
Bummers. Maybe...

280
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,174
Maybe what?

281
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:47,174
Right, Agent Jodie Starling?

282
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:48,175
-What? -What?

283
00:15:48,176 --> 00:15:50,574
I wish you would listen to what I'm saying.

284
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,574
After all, I'm trying to find the perpetrator

285
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:56,275
that put your friend through all this.

286
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,375
Right.

287
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:00,874
In Japan circles are used to mark the correct answers

288
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,474
and check marks are used to mark wrong answers.

289
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:05,374
But in the States,

290
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,874
correct answers are marked with check marks!

291
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,674
-What? -What?

292
00:16:09,675 --> 00:16:12,274
That's correct, isn't it, Agent Jodie?

293
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:16,374
Yes. The check marks don't mean the answers are wrong.

294
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:20,174
In Japan you also put check marks on mark sheets, don't you?

295
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:21,574
It's the same.

296
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:24,574
But why is there a circle around the wrong answer?

297
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:29,474
That circle means to recheck the answer because it's wrong.

298
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:31,774
Well, it really depends on the teacher though,

299
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:34,174
whether the wrong answer would be marked with a circle.

300
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:37,074
Which means that the test papers below

301
00:16:37,075 --> 00:16:40,274
were graded by Natsuko who came back from the States

302
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:45,374
and the ones on top were graded by the perpetrator who's a Japanese?

303
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,474
Yes.

304
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:50,674
Besides, don't you think the circles of the papers on the top

305
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:53,574
are pretty distorted and sticking out of the paper?

306
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:56,174
Yeah but why?

307
00:16:56,175 --> 00:17:00,174
Well, it could be that the perpetrator is quite clumsy

308
00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:05,374
or the perpetrator was trying to hide something red using the red pen.

309
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,574
-Blood stains! -I see!

310
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:10,074
When the perpetrator struck her here,

311
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:13,874
blood splattered on the test papers that she hadn't corrected yet.

312
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,474
So in order to hide it,

313
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:18,174
the perpetrator traced the blood stains with a red pen to grade the papers.

314
00:17:18,175 --> 00:17:20,674
That's why the circles are distorted!

315
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:21,774
Correct.

316
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:26,475
The question is who of the three did that.

317
00:17:27,575 --> 00:17:30,674
And? I hope you already know who it is.

318
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:31,874
Of course!

319
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,274
It's easy, right, Conan?

320
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:36,474
What? Oh. Yep!

321
00:17:36,475 --> 00:17:37,974
It's the flower circle!

322
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:41,574
I figured it out as soon as I saw the photo of the flower circle!

323
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:43,674
I figured out who drew it!

324
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:45,374
-Flower circle? -Flower circle?

325
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:51,974
Yep! Compare the flower circles that Ms. Shibuya and the perpetrator drew!

326
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:54,774
The swirls are drawn in differently, see?

327
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:56,674
You're right!

328
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,874
The perpetrator drawn it counter clockwise.

329
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,174
It's usually drawn clockwise, isn't it?

330
00:18:02,175 --> 00:18:03,474
Yeah.

331
00:18:03,475 --> 00:18:07,674
Which means that the perpetrator isn't Mr. Sugamoto

332
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:10,774
who wiped his perspiration with a handkerchief using his right hand

333
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:13,174
neither was it Mrs. Ueno who took Mr. Camel's handkerchief

334
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,174
using her right hand.

335
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:19,574
Mr. Kandachi used his left hand to light his lighter.

336
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:21,775
So, it makes him the perpetrator, right?

337
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:26,574
I see.

338
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:30,974
A left-hander would draw the swirl of the flower circle counter clockwise.

339
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:32,174
Oh, no.

340
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:33,974
It's true that I'm left-handed

341
00:18:33,975 --> 00:18:36,974
but I draw my flower circles from the center!

342
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:39,574
I didn't draw those.

343
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:40,874
No.

344
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,674
As to both of the flower circles,

345
00:18:42,675 --> 00:18:45,974
the pressure of the pen tapered towards the center.

346
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:48,274
So, that's proof that it was drawn from the outside in.

347
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:50,474
Besides, didn't you said that

348
00:18:50,475 --> 00:18:52,574
she was grading papers

349
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:55,774
and figures were flying through her head

350
00:18:55,775 --> 00:18:57,674
so she got confused as to the time.

351
00:18:57,675 --> 00:19:00,674
Elementary school teachers teach other subjects too

352
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:02,574
and yet, how did you know

353
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:06,174
that she was grading the arithmetic test?

354
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:08,874
Come on, give me a good excuse.

355
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,374
If you have any other answer besides,

356
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,775
"I saw it at the crime site" that is.

357
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:20,374
She was laughing.

358
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,074
When I shouted that she graded the paper incorrectly,

359
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:24,974
she laughed by saying it just a habit of hers

360
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:27,074
after returning from the States.

361
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:28,374
Is that why you...

362
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,774
I didn't know that

363
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:33,574
the way they graded papers in Japan and the States was different!

364
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:36,474
It's true that Natsuko is also to blame

365
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,874
for not grading the papers Japanese style

366
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,674
but you could've figured it out

367
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:41,274
if you took a good look at the answer sheet, no?

368
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:43,674
I was outraged and couldn't think that far.

369
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:46,174
Then what about your car being stolen?

370
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:47,774
It's a lie.

371
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:50,874
I didn't want her hair or what not's being in the car

372
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,774
so I had a friend keep it for me.

373
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,674
Excuse me!

374
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:56,774
The hospital just called.

375
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:58,774
Ms. Shibuya took a turn for the worse

376
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:00,575
and she's in critical condition.

377
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,975
Natsuko?

378
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,375
"Haido Central Hospital"

379
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,274
What did you come for?

380
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:24,874
You've got no business here anymore, do you?

381
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,175
She's my client.

382
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:31,075
Besides...

383
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:36,275
I thought that you'd carelessly make a slip of a tongue.

384
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,275
Natsuko. Please.

385
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:43,074
Don't die!

386
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,275
Natsuko!

387
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:49,274
Oh, Jodie. You came all the way out here to see me.

388
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:50,474
Yes...

389
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:53,874
But, it's amazing you knew that I regained consciousness.

390
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:54,974
Huh?

391
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:57,774
As to what happened this time, I'm to blame too,

392
00:20:57,775 --> 00:20:59,374
so I feel quite uncomfortable.

393
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,674
I told them not to let the school know about it yet.

394
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:04,374
This is bad.

395
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,874
Ms. Jodie!

396
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,274
Where's Agent Camel now?

397
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:09,775
I think he's by the car?

398
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:32,374
"Haido Central Hospital"

399
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,474
Rikumichi Kusuda?

400
00:22:34,475 --> 00:22:36,674
I don't know a guy like that.

401
00:22:36,675 --> 00:22:39,074
He's a guy who used to be hospitalized here,

402
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:43,574
stopped his car nearby and went missing.

403
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:46,174
I hear that there was a gun involved or something.

404
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:48,774
Haven't you heard anything about it from your buddies?

405
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:49,874
Nope.

406
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,574
Oh, I see!

407
00:22:51,575 --> 00:22:53,874
I guess it's information that's not passed down

408
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:57,074
to a low-ranking agent like you.

409
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,574
Just what are you talking about?

410
00:22:58,575 --> 00:23:01,074
We always share common information...

411
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:02,474
Camel!

412
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:04,174
Just what're you doing?

413
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,175
Stay with me, will you?

414
00:23:12,075 --> 00:23:15,174
I hope you didn't tell him about Kusuda?

415
00:23:15,175 --> 00:23:16,774
Of course not.

416
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:20,374
I wouldn't dare say that the guy shot himself to death in the car.

417
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:23,874
Over my dead body.

418
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,274
I see.

419
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:26,474
Thank you.

420
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:30,374
Well, it's an incident that occurred before I was dispatched to Japan,

421
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,375
so I just heard about it from Mr. Akai.

422
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:36,874
Jodie?

423
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,374
Where are you?

424
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,575
Jodie?

425
00:23:43,675 --> 00:23:45,674
"Next Episode" -The skill to change the tone of voice

426
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:48,874
and amazing disguising technique.

427
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,375
A woman posses a combination of both.

428
00:23:55,075 --> 00:23:58,075
He seems to have shot himself to death.

429
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:02,775
I see, so that's the story.

430
