1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,670
Okay, Conan, watch the house while I'm away.

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:05,997
Yep.

3
00:00:05,997 --> 00:00:07,297
I'll be going then, bye.

4
00:00:07,297 --> 00:00:09,497
See you, bye.

5
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:12,097
Ran's gone to club practice,

6
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:13,897
Pops is checking on an infidelity case,

7
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:16,797
and Genta guys haven't called or anything.

8
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:19,597
I guess I can take it easy today.

9
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:23,497
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

10
00:00:23,497 --> 00:00:25,897
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

11
00:00:25,897 --> 00:00:27,697
Doc and Haibara hitchhike?

12
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:29,497
There is a suspicious couple on the car that they get into.

13
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:31,097
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,897
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:35,597
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

16
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:21,333
"Dangerous Twosome."

17
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,649
"Mouri Detective Agency."

18
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:24,949
Hey...

19
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:27,749
Did your Beetle stop on you again?

20
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:29,741
Right...

21
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:33,641
I came to introduce my new invention in Yamanashi, you see.

22
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:36,841
The one that you go to every year.

23
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:38,741
Then the car suddenly stopped moving

24
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,341
on our way back home.

25
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:43,741
I did call the auto service

26
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:46,941
and had them tow the car away though

27
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:50,941
and had them drop us off at a nearby bus stop.

28
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:52,341
You mean the bus isn't coming?

29
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:54,141
Oh, no...

30
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,441
Oh, I'm sorry, we're not riding.

31
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:07,341
Hey, don't tell me that your wallet...

32
00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:09,041
Yeah.

33
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,741
I must've dropped it somewhere.

34
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:15,141
It didn't seem to have much money inside but...

35
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:16,741
I see.

36
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:18,941
You called me and wanted me to ask Pops

37
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:23,941
to go and pick you up,

38
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:27,241
but Pops is out investigating an infidelity case and not home.

39
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:28,841
What?

40
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,141
There's nothing to get all worked up over, is there?

41
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:33,941
You can have you know who, come pick you up by cab.

42
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:35,041
You know who?

43
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,041
You know! Who else?

44
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,441
She's staying over at your place,

45
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:40,141
watching house anyway, isn't she?

46
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:42,441
The one with the stink eyes who's always yawning.

47
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:44,341
I'm so sorry.

48
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,041
I've got stink eyes and is yawning all the time.

49
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,341
I mean why are you there too?

50
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:53,041
You're always looking down

51
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,941
at Doc's inventions, aren't you?

52
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:58,241
Right, I didn't want to come along,

53
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:01,541
but I didn't want to stay home and watch the house either.

54
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,241
Not in that house where the God knows who man

55
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:06,541
is living next door.

56
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,041
You mean Mr. Subaru Okiya?

57
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,141
Don't worry about him.

58
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:12,741
He seems to be a good person.

59
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:13,841
That's right!

60
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:17,341
Why don't you have Subaru come pick you up by car?

61
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:21,541
I don't know about you,

62
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,641
but I suspect him as being one of the the men

63
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:27,641
of the Black Organization as you call it, you know.

64
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,141
Subaru? No way.

65
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:33,341
I sensed it.

66
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,541
Huh?

67
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,041
Back then at Ikkaku Rock...

68
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,841
The pressure I felt back then...

69
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:47,341
was undoubtedly that of the Organization.

70
00:04:48,441 --> 00:04:50,441
No way.

71
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:53,141
If so, both you and I would've been gone long ago.

72
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:56,841
I hope you're not locking him up in that house of yours

73
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:59,241
and making him watch me,

74
00:04:59,241 --> 00:05:01,041
using me as bait

75
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,941
and waiting for him to make his move, are you?

76
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,741
Don't talk stupid!

77
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:06,941
I'd never do something like that!

78
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:08,241
At any rate,

79
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,941
make up a reason

80
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:12,841
and chase him out of your house, will you?

81
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:16,341
Because the Organization may have already found out

82
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:20,041
that I'm Sherry, the one who betrayed the Organization,

83
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:23,641
and Shinichi Kudo that they already thought died is still alive

84
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:25,641
because of information from him.

85
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:28,841
Right, it could be that they are slowly making plans

86
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:30,941
to kill us secretly behind the scene

87
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:34,041
and the assassins of the Organization may already be right nearby.

88
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,141
If you're in trouble, I'll give you a lift.

89
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:44,541
You don't have money on you, right?

90
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,541
Oh, thank you.

91
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,941
We're going to Tokyo, but is that okay?

92
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:53,641
Yes, we were just on our way back to Tokyo too.

93
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:55,041
Okay, then get in the backseat.

94
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:58,641
-Thank you. -I guess we'll somehow manage to get back home.

95
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:00,341
I want you to think about

96
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:01,641
chasing him out of your house

97
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,041
before we arrive back home.

98
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,241
Hey, Haibara!

99
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,541
Well, you really are a great help indeed.

100
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,741
He hasn't had much sleep last night.

101
00:06:19,741 --> 00:06:21,341
Oh, I see.

102
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:27,341
It's a little loaded there, but bear it, will you.

103
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:29,441
Huh? Loaded?

104
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:31,541
It means that since there are things in the backseat,

105
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,441
it's a bit cluttered, isn't it?

106
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:35,641
By the way,

107
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:37,241
tell me, will you?

108
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:38,741
What?

109
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:40,341
How did you know

110
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:42,441
that we didn't have money?

111
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:46,041
She probably heard me talking on the phone, I think.

112
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,641
About me saying that I lost my wallet.

113
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:52,241
Do you think a person who is driving can accurately hear

114
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:55,341
what someone's saying on the side of the road?

115
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:59,441
It's understandable if they stopped after overtaking us,

116
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:02,141
but you stopped before overtaking us, didn't you?

117
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:05,241
I stopped the car,

118
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:09,641
because I saw you not boarding the bus despite it coming.

119
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:11,741
And you're saying that

120
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:14,641
you heard what was said when you stopped the car?

121
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:16,741
No, when I stopped,

122
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:21,341
the stain on the chest of that old man caught my eye.

123
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,941
I spilled coke here, you see.

124
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:29,441
You spilled it with your seatbelt fastened, didn't you?

125
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:31,941
Since there aren't any stains in the middle.

126
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:35,241
Moreover, you spilled it just a while ago.

127
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:38,541
No one would ever go out with stained clothes, you see.

128
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,041
Right...

129
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,841
Which means that you were driving till just a while ago.

130
00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:47,341
Yet, there was no car near you.

131
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,741
And, when I bought canned coffee

132
00:07:49,741 --> 00:07:51,441
at a vending machine alongside the road,

133
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:55,541
considering that I saw a tow truck pulling a car along back then.

134
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,741
I figured that maybe you had car trouble,

135
00:07:57,741 --> 00:07:59,541
called a tow truck and had it moved.

136
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,841
Then, you had them drive you over to the bus stop,

137
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:05,341
but you realized that you had lost your wallet,

138
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:09,541
so even if you wanted to ride the bus, you couldn't.

139
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,541
Exactly.

140
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,341
Just as I thought.

141
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:17,641
So, is it okay for me to start off now, little lady?

142
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:19,741
Yes.

143
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:38,941
Quite a bit of traffic.

144
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:41,441
There seems to have been an accident a little beyond.

145
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:43,241
You can sleep if you like, until we get to where we're going.

146
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:45,141
Thank you.

147
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:48,041
By the way, where in Tokyo is your home?

148
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,141
Beikacho 2-chome.

149
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:53,741
Beikacho... what a coincidence.

150
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,941
Coincidence?

151
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:57,941
We happen to be headed there too.

152
00:08:57,941 --> 00:09:01,441
To the Mouri Detective Agency at Beikacho 5-chome.

153
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:04,841
Oh! Is that so?

154
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:06,741
We happen to be an acquaintance of his...

155
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:13,041
I'm a bit sleepy.

156
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,241
Let's take a snooze while we can, gramps.

157
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:18,041
Yeah.

158
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,541
Wake us up when we get there, okay?

159
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,941
Okay.

160
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:23,141
What's the matter, Ai?

161
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:25,841
These people are strange.

162
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:26,941
You saw his face, didn't you?

163
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,141
The guy in the passenger's seat.

164
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:32,941
Yeah... he does have a large scar,

165
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:34,841
and looks sort of frightening,

166
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,241
but I don't see why that would make him worthy of suspicion.

167
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:38,841
Haven't you notice?

168
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:40,641
The back rest of the driver's seat.

169
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:45,141
There's one there.

170
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:49,041
And two on the left door of this backseat.

171
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,041
These are probably bullet traces.

172
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,241
What?

173
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:55,941
They may have thought it's been cleanly wiped off,

174
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:58,741
but there are traces of blood stains

175
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:00,241
left on the seam of the seat.

176
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:01,741
What?

177
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:03,541
Is anything the matter?

178
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,641
No...

179
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:07,341
Gramps talking in his sleep is so noisy.

180
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:08,441
I see.

181
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:14,541
So, let's pretend to be asleep for a while and check things out.

182
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,441
About who these two are

183
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:21,441
and why on earth they're going to the Mouri Detective Agency.

184
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,941
What is it?

185
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:29,941
It seems that we've got additional load while I was asleep.

186
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:32,141
I picked them up part way.

187
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:34,941
They seem to be acquaintances of Detective Mouri.

188
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:38,441
That sure is convenient...

189
00:10:38,441 --> 00:10:41,041
we don't have to go through the trouble of looking for his place then.

190
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,141
By the way, what do you think of that brat?

191
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:45,941
What brat?

192
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:47,841
That boy called Conan Edogawa

193
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:50,241
that's hanging around Kogoro Mouri.

194
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:53,241
What do I think?

195
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:57,241
Well, I think he's pretty bright for a kid his age.

196
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,641
The way I see it,

197
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:02,241
I think it's that brat that's got everything under control.

198
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:05,441
That brat is sure some monster.

199
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:08,541
Well, we brought along a lot of gifts for him too,

200
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,141
and if we give him a sweet pat,

201
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:13,341
I'm sure he'll sing us a tune or two.

202
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:16,141
I wonder though, if that will do the trick?

203
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:19,441
Half killing is enough.

204
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:20,441
Half...

205
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:21,641
Half killing?

206
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:24,041
It's a bit early yet, isn't it?

207
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:27,341
We've still got a little more to go...

208
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:29,841
before we kill them all off.

209
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:35,041
I'm really looking forward to it.

210
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:40,541
I'm sure my half killing will be delightful.

211
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:45,241
It's not the usual half killing you see around.

212
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:53,386
I'm looking forward to it.

213
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:56,986
I'm sure it'll delight him to tears.

214
00:11:56,986 --> 00:11:58,986
My half killing after all

215
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:02,986
is not the usual you see around.

216
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:07,086
Oh, you got up?

217
00:12:07,086 --> 00:12:08,986
Yes.

218
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:12,386
Did you hear what we were talking about just now?

219
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:13,486
What you were saying?

220
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:16,286
I got up because gramps snoring was too noisy.

221
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:18,586
Were you talking about some thing

222
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:20,086
you didn't want anyone to hear about?

223
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:23,186
No. It's fine if you didn't hear anything.

224
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:26,186
Boy, this traffic jam is so annoying.

225
00:12:26,186 --> 00:12:28,886
Despite already being in Tokyo.

226
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:29,886
Would you like to take a break at a drive-in

227
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:31,986
and have tea or something then?

228
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:34,886
Maybe the traffic will start moving more smoothly after we rest a while.

229
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:36,486
I'd like to hear about your connection

230
00:12:36,486 --> 00:12:38,686
with the Mouri Detective Agency too, besides.

231
00:12:38,686 --> 00:12:39,986
Huh?

232
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:43,986
But, it's only if you two are not in a rush.

233
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:47,886
If you want to get home that fast,

234
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:50,186
get off the car and fly home on your own.

235
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,886
Fly... how?

236
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:59,186
Okay, let's take a break at the drive-in then.

237
00:12:59,186 --> 00:13:01,086
Will you look at the map for me, then?

238
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:03,186
It's in the dashboard.

239
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:04,286
Okay.

240
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:08,986
A gun?

241
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:15,086
"Mouri Detective Agency."

242
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,286
What?

243
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:19,886
You hitchhiked and got on the car of bad guys?

244
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:22,586
Yes, a twosome, a man and a woman.

245
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:25,086
It seems they want to get information

246
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:26,786
out of Detective Mouri and you.

247
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:29,286
Are they people from the Black Organization?

248
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:32,786
I wonder... I don't smell anything like that,

249
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:34,686
but they're armed with a gun.

250
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:37,086
Are you still with them?

251
00:13:37,086 --> 00:13:40,486
Yes, Doc is talking with them now.

252
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,486
I pretended to go to the restroom

253
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:44,286
and am talking to you over the cell.

254
00:13:44,286 --> 00:13:45,986
Is Doc okay, or what?

255
00:13:45,986 --> 00:13:47,986
No need to worry.

256
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:49,586
I made sure he tells them that our connection with you

257
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:53,186
is that we asked you to look for a cat for us.

258
00:13:53,186 --> 00:13:54,886
No, I didn't mean that!

259
00:13:54,886 --> 00:13:56,486
If they're dangerous guys,

260
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:57,686
I think you should get out of there as soon as possible!

261
00:13:57,686 --> 00:13:58,986
Don't be silly.

262
00:13:58,986 --> 00:14:03,086
They're headed that way ready to half kill you.

263
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:05,086
We can't just let that happen, can we?

264
00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:06,886
Half kill?

265
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:08,986
That's what the man said.

266
00:14:08,986 --> 00:14:10,886
It's enough to just half kill them.

267
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:13,486
That killing them all off should be put off yet.

268
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,486
Killing everybody off?

269
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:18,286
In other words, they going to half kill you all

270
00:14:18,286 --> 00:14:20,186
and get whatever information they want from you,

271
00:14:20,186 --> 00:14:23,286
then kill us all off, right?

272
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:26,586
Hey, are you sure that they aren't from the Black Organization?

273
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:30,386
Well, I can't say for sure just yet.

274
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:32,386
And if that thing that they want to hear from you is about me,

275
00:14:32,386 --> 00:14:35,486
the whereabouts of the one who betrayed the Organization,

276
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:37,086
everything will fall in place.

277
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:39,786
If you're at that drive-in,

278
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:40,986
I can speed over on my skateboard...

279
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:44,486
In 30 minutes.

280
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:47,786
Please hold them in place somehow until I get there.

281
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,886
Hold them in place, how?

282
00:14:49,886 --> 00:14:53,486
Just say something like you coincidentally ran into an acquaintance

283
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:55,386
who's going back to Tokyo from Chiba

284
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:57,186
and that you're going to have that person drive you home.

285
00:14:59,786 --> 00:15:01,786
Chiba?

286
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:04,586
We're at a drive-in that's on our back

287
00:15:04,586 --> 00:15:06,086
from Yamanashi to Tokyo, you know?

288
00:15:06,086 --> 00:15:08,186
They'll figure out that it's a lie right away.

289
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:09,586
If they found out you lied,

290
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:10,986
they'll think that something happened

291
00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:12,486
and look for you guys, won't they?

292
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:14,886
I see, so you want us to hide somewhere

293
00:15:14,886 --> 00:15:17,386
in the drive-in till then.

294
00:15:17,386 --> 00:15:20,386
But, if they don't see through the lie...

295
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,186
They'd be no problem.

296
00:15:23,186 --> 00:15:26,186
I'll call Officer Takagi and ask him to ambush them

297
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:28,386
at the Detective Agency and arrest them.

298
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,786
I'll tell him that they're armed with a gun and dangerous.

299
00:15:32,886 --> 00:15:34,786
I think I'd be handle the two

300
00:15:34,786 --> 00:15:36,486
with the tranquilizer gun and my soccer ball.

301
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:38,686
But what after that?

302
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:42,286
What if they're men from the Black Organization?

303
00:15:45,386 --> 00:15:49,986
On a car of a friend going from Chiba to Tokyo.

304
00:15:49,986 --> 00:15:51,186
Lucky you.

305
00:15:51,186 --> 00:15:52,686
Oh, yes.

306
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:56,186
Thank you for giving us a lift all the way here.

307
00:15:56,186 --> 00:15:57,486
Goodbye.

308
00:16:01,286 --> 00:16:04,186
They're lying.

309
00:16:04,186 --> 00:16:06,886
Yes, but I wonder why?

310
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:10,586
They heard us talking about half killing.

311
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:13,486
That we were talking about a while ago.

312
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:17,086
Just as you had hoped,

313
00:16:17,086 --> 00:16:19,786
the twosome figured out that it was a lie right away

314
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:21,486
and are looking all over for us.

315
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:24,086
And where are you two?

316
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:26,486
For now, we're in the toilet.

317
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,986
But, it's just a matter of time until they find us.

318
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:32,486
It could be someone involved in a case that Pops handled

319
00:16:32,486 --> 00:16:35,586
and solved before that has a grudge against him too.

320
00:16:35,586 --> 00:16:38,086
Tell me what the two are like.

321
00:16:38,086 --> 00:16:41,086
The woman is wearing a knitted cap and wearing sunglasses.

322
00:16:41,086 --> 00:16:43,986
Her bangs are divided to the right and left and over her forehead.

323
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:47,286
The man is tanned and is unshaven.

324
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:51,086
I saw that he had a big scar on his left eye.

325
00:16:51,086 --> 00:16:53,086
A large scar on his left eye?

326
00:16:53,086 --> 00:16:56,386
Well, he sure isn't someone straight.

327
00:16:56,386 --> 00:17:01,186
There was a gun in the dashboard of the car.

328
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,886
In the car there are three bullet marks

329
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:06,186
and traces of blood being wiped off.

330
00:17:06,186 --> 00:17:07,986
Did you notice anything else?

331
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,986
What else could there be?

332
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:11,986
Oh, that's right.

333
00:17:11,986 --> 00:17:14,486
They used strange language.

334
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:15,586
Strange language?

335
00:17:15,586 --> 00:17:18,786
It's a bit cluttered, but please bear it,

336
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:20,086
and if you want to get home that fast,

337
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:22,986
get off the car and fly home on your own.

338
00:17:22,986 --> 00:17:25,786
Cluttered... fly?

339
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:27,786
Maybe it's a code or something?

340
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:30,086
At any rate, I'll be there in five minutes.

341
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:31,086
So stay still over there till...

342
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:32,986
Hey gramps, are you there?

343
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,686
If there, answer me!

344
00:17:35,686 --> 00:17:37,586
It's occupied!

345
00:17:37,586 --> 00:17:40,086
I guess we don't have much of a chance.

346
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:42,586
He's going around knocking on all the doors of the toilet.

347
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:44,186
I'll be right out!

348
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:45,586
What shall we do?

349
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:46,786
Wait a second.

350
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:49,186
The words cluttered and fly are...

351
00:17:49,186 --> 00:17:51,186
Conan?

352
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:53,286
Half kill and kill them all...

353
00:17:53,286 --> 00:17:54,586
Conan?

354
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:57,186
A large scar on his left eye...

355
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:00,886
Hey, what's up?

356
00:18:00,886 --> 00:18:02,386
Here he comes.

357
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:04,386
Answer me, I said!

358
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:05,586
Conan.

359
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,086
Don't worry.

360
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,686
If you shout in an adult voice

361
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:11,286
that you're using the toilet,

362
00:18:11,286 --> 00:18:13,586
I'm sure he'll leave right away.

363
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:15,086
That man will probably be hesitant

364
00:18:15,086 --> 00:18:18,186
if he learns that a woman is inside.

365
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:19,886
I guess so...

366
00:18:22,086 --> 00:18:25,486
I guess the gramps seems to be in here.

367
00:18:28,386 --> 00:18:30,686
How rude! Can't you see that I'm using the toilet?

368
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:32,186
You lewd dirty rat!

369
00:18:35,786 --> 00:18:39,786
Oh, sorry...

370
00:18:45,886 --> 00:18:48,886
Wait. This is the men's room.

371
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:50,386
I figured.

372
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:52,886
Doc would never use the women's restroom.

373
00:18:52,886 --> 00:18:54,986
Figured...

374
00:18:54,986 --> 00:18:58,086
Maybe he figured out at hearing my voice just now.

375
00:18:58,086 --> 00:19:00,086
Isn't there a little window in the toilet

376
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:01,586
where you can make it outside?

377
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:07,886
There is...

378
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:11,086
Then, get out of there with Doc.

379
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:14,386
What after we get out?

380
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:18,686
Well, when you get out of there, it's most likely that...

381
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:20,786
The woman will be waiting

382
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,586
and not long after her...

383
00:19:26,886 --> 00:19:29,086
I'm sure the man will come.

384
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:37,886
Give in and get caught already.

385
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,286
Give in?

386
00:19:42,086 --> 00:19:43,786
It'll be all right.

387
00:19:43,786 --> 00:19:45,286
These two are...

388
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:46,686
police officers.

389
00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:51,586
Police officers...

390
00:19:51,586 --> 00:19:55,086
But, why are you wearing sunglasses?

391
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:56,686
The thing is, the other day...

392
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:58,186
"Yui Uehara, age 29" -a culprit I was escorting along.

393
00:19:58,186 --> 00:20:00,686
"Yui Uehara, age 29" -punched me and I ended up with black and blue.

394
00:20:01,486 --> 00:20:04,886
You're lucky that all you got was a bruise.

395
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:07,086
"Kansuke Yamato, age 35" -The shot that the guy.

396
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:08,186
"Kansuke Yamato, age 35" -fired skimmed pass my forehead,

397
00:20:08,186 --> 00:20:09,686
"Kansuke Yamato, age 35" -and this is how I ended up.

398
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:38,186
"Mouri Detective Agency."

399
00:21:38,186 --> 00:21:40,786
Well, with that scar and those sunglasses,

400
00:21:40,786 --> 00:21:43,486
it can't be helped that they thought you were bad guys.

401
00:21:43,486 --> 00:21:46,886
Just the other day I arrested a guy,

402
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:48,586
but the instant I got him in the car,

403
00:21:48,586 --> 00:21:51,486
he fired randomly with the gun he had on him.

404
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:52,786
And when we pinned him down to arrest him,

405
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:54,686
I got this bruise on my right eyes

406
00:21:54,686 --> 00:21:57,486
and Kan-chan hurt his forehead.

407
00:21:57,486 --> 00:21:59,586
The bullet traces and blood stain in the car

408
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:01,886
were made back then.

409
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:04,986
But, amazing how you figured out it was us.

410
00:22:04,986 --> 00:22:06,786
Tsumoi in Nagano dialect means cluttered

411
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:10,086
and fly means to run home.

412
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:12,886
Besides, Inspector Yamato is the only one

413
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,486
at the Nagano Prefectural Police Department

414
00:22:14,486 --> 00:22:15,786
who knows us well

415
00:22:15,786 --> 00:22:17,486
and has a big scar on his left eye.

416
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:20,486
But, I think that the joke was carried too far this time.

417
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:23,586
Saying things like half killing and kill them all.

418
00:22:23,586 --> 00:22:26,386
That's why we thought you mistook us

419
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,586
for being dangerous people and fled.

420
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:29,586
So, we came to look for you,

421
00:22:29,586 --> 00:22:33,486
thinking that you fled despite having no cash on you.

422
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:34,686
Mistook you?

423
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:38,686
The phrase half killing means...

424
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,086
this rice cake.

425
00:22:45,086 --> 00:22:47,186
It looks so good!

426
00:22:47,186 --> 00:22:50,386
Yes, Kan-chan's rice cake is the best

427
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:51,586
because his grandmother taught him how to make it.

428
00:22:53,386 --> 00:22:57,086
And why is the Bota rice cake called half killing?

429
00:22:57,086 --> 00:22:58,786
It's called half killing

430
00:22:58,786 --> 00:23:01,886
because only half of the mocha rice is smashed to make it.

431
00:23:01,886 --> 00:23:04,186
By the way, when all the mochi rice is smashed,

432
00:23:04,186 --> 00:23:05,686
it's called killing all.

433
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:09,886
In other words, killing them all off can be put off till later means,

434
00:23:09,886 --> 00:23:13,286
New Year's when mochi is eaten is still sometime away, right?

435
00:23:13,286 --> 00:23:14,486
Exactly.

436
00:23:14,486 --> 00:23:17,886
Is that how people in Nagano refer to it?

437
00:23:17,886 --> 00:23:22,486
No, Kan-chan after hearing that old folklore from his grandmother,

438
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:25,186
is using it that way in his own way.

439
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:28,086
Kan-chan loves stimulating trouble toned words, you see.

440
00:23:28,086 --> 00:23:31,286
And what happened in Nagano?

441
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:33,686
I'm sure you didn't come here

442
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:34,986
just to bring us the mochi, did you?

443
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:39,186
Oh, well, there's something we just can't solve.

444
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:42,386
So, we wanted you to help us out.

445
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:46,786
The mystery about the blood smeared Red Wall.

446
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:48,686
What?

447
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:52,686
The blood smeared...

448
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:55,786
mystery of the Red Wall?

449
00:23:57,286 --> 00:23:59,886
"Next Episode" -The hopeless...

450
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:02,386
House of Death.

451
00:24:02,386 --> 00:24:06,486
It seems that Kan is not relying on Detective Mouri,

452
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:09,386
but rather you.

453
00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:12,786
So, this is the Red Wall.

454
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:16,686
Hey, don't tell me that this is...

455
00:24:16,686 --> 00:24:18,086
Human blood?

456
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:19,986
What did you come here for?

457
00:24:19,986 --> 00:24:21,786
Komei!

458
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:23,286
Next Conan,

459
00:24:23,286 --> 00:24:30,286
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Three Favors)"

460
00:24:41,977 --> 00:24:44,177
Next Conan's Hint:

461
00:24:44,177 --> 00:24:46,277
"Red spray."

462
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,177
The title of the next episode is sure disturbing.

463
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:50,177
Your stomach sure needs to get rid of disturbing fat too.

464
00:24:50,177 --> 00:24:51,277
I'm that fat?
