1
00:00:01,484 --> 00:00:03,184
And, how was it?

2
00:00:03,184 --> 00:00:04,884
Did you find out about the old man

3
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:06,884
who used to know Eisuke Hondo as a child?

4
00:00:06,884 --> 00:00:09,384
You got to talk to his grandson, didn't you?

5
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,884
-Yeah. -What do you mean, "Yeah..."

6
00:00:11,984 --> 00:00:13,784
Tell me about it.

7
00:00:13,784 --> 00:00:15,984
I'm a bit concerned too, you know.

8
00:00:15,984 --> 00:00:18,884
I got to meet the grandson of the man who said he knew the man

9
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:20,384
and his friend.

10
00:00:20,384 --> 00:00:22,484
They gave me a lot of information

11
00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:24,084
and a picture.

12
00:00:24,084 --> 00:00:25,184
A picture?

13
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:27,884
Oh, of Eisuke Hondo when he was a child,

14
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:32,484
a man behind him that's supposed to be his father.

15
00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:34,584
Wow, you did it, Kudo!

16
00:00:34,584 --> 00:00:37,584
And? Do you remember seeing that man somewhere?

17
00:00:37,584 --> 00:00:39,284
No, I don't.

18
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:45,784
According to his grandson's friend, he seems to have said,

19
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:47,384
"The time has come to dive."

20
00:00:47,384 --> 00:00:48,484
"Dive?"

21
00:00:48,484 --> 00:00:50,684
And the man's friends seem to have said things like,

22
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:55,484
"Give it your best shot." Or, "Take care."

23
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:57,084
When you say "dive",

24
00:00:57,084 --> 00:01:00,084
it usually means going underwater or into the sea, right?

25
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:02,384
Yeah, since the friend of the grandson

26
00:01:02,384 --> 00:01:05,184
was told that the man was an office worker,

27
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:08,184
he thought that man was going diving or something.

28
00:01:08,184 --> 00:01:10,584
But more correctly,

29
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:12,684
that man was just any other office worker

30
00:01:12,684 --> 00:01:15,484
who was hired by "the Company."

31
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:17,884
The company?

32
00:01:17,884 --> 00:01:20,084
Kudo, don't tell me that's...

33
00:01:20,084 --> 00:01:21,984
Yeah, I don't know if that "Company"

34
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:23,684
is what we think it is

35
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,084
or just any other company.

36
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:27,484
But, the man told me that the old man

37
00:01:27,484 --> 00:01:28,884
really got along with that man,

38
00:01:28,884 --> 00:01:31,284
and that they used to have deep conversation with each other.

39
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:34,684
Taking into consideration that he was an unmatched suspense fan,

40
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:36,184
he figured from the way he talked

41
00:01:36,184 --> 00:01:39,184
or characteristic way of saying things...

42
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:42,584
So he may be a member of "the Company"

43
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:45,084
that we're thinking of.

44
00:01:45,084 --> 00:01:46,284
Yeah.

45
00:01:47,284 --> 00:01:48,684
But, Kudo,

46
00:01:48,684 --> 00:01:51,884
if it turns out to be true, it's big trouble.

47
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:53,184
I think it's best to watch how things go

48
00:01:53,184 --> 00:01:55,284
without doing anything for now.

49
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:57,984
What would you do?

50
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,584
If you were in my position?

51
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:02,584
Well, if it were me, I'd just go for it.

52
00:02:02,584 --> 00:02:04,984
I mean, no, I would...

53
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:08,084
I'd do exactly what you would.

54
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:11,784
I'll pry as deep as I can into it.

55
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:17,184
Until the curiosity within me dries out.

56
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:20,484
Hey, Conan, just how long are you going to stay locked in there.

57
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:21,484
I'm leaving without you!

58
00:02:21,484 --> 00:02:24,184
Oh, sorry, I'll be right out.

59
00:02:24,184 --> 00:02:26,584
Hey, don't tell me you're talking about something important like this

60
00:02:26,584 --> 00:02:28,784
in the restroom?

61
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:31,084
I wonder if he has a stomachache or something.

62
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,984
Ran! Let's just leave that brat behind

63
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:34,384
and go to the hospital.

64
00:02:34,384 --> 00:02:37,684
After all, we're going to visit our intermediate school days classmate.

65
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:40,284
But, you haven't eaten lunch yet either, have you, Sonoko?

66
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:42,184
So, I thought that we could drop by and have lunch

67
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:44,084
after visiting the hospital.

68
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:46,184
Because dad is at the horse races

69
00:02:46,184 --> 00:02:48,884
and Conan would have to stay home alone so...

70
00:02:48,884 --> 00:02:51,284
Sorry, Hattori. I'll call you if I find out anything more.

71
00:02:51,284 --> 00:02:54,184
Hey, hold it.

72
00:02:57,884 --> 00:02:59,584
Be careful.

73
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:00,984
Kudo.

74
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:15,584
Sizzling hot suspense.

75
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,084
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

76
00:03:18,084 --> 00:03:19,884
Intertwined in the mystery of the Black Organization

77
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:20,884
are Eisuke Hondo and Rena Mizunashi.

78
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:23,684
The curtains of the new series are ready to unfold!

79
00:03:23,684 --> 00:03:25,184
He sees through the one and only truth.

80
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:26,784
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

81
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:29,284
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

82
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:59,577
"Red and Black Crash: Prologue."

83
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:01,677
"West Beika Hospital."

84
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:04,377
Bye. See you!

85
00:05:05,977 --> 00:05:08,377
I tell you, that Aya.

86
00:05:08,377 --> 00:05:10,477
I mean we rush over super worried because we heard that

87
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,877
her appendicitis was on the verge of bursting.

88
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:13,977
Yet she turns out looking just great

89
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:17,777
saying that she wants to fill her stomach with cake and parfait!

90
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:21,277
All for the better, since she seems to be doing great.

91
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:24,877
Oh, no. Talking about food made my stomach growl.

92
00:05:24,877 --> 00:05:26,677
Let's go eat right now then!

93
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:30,877
The burger shop that opened near here is pretty popular!

94
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:32,377
Of course they also have

95
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:35,877
the "children's set" that Conan loves too.

96
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,177
It's the plate that comes with the toy.

97
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:40,777
Then shall we invite him over to come too?

98
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:41,877
Him?

99
00:05:41,877 --> 00:05:43,577
That klutz!

100
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,577
Oh, Eisuke!

101
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:47,377
Him!

102
00:05:47,377 --> 00:05:49,777
Oh, Ms. Mouri and Ms. Suzuki!

103
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:55,377
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:55,377 --> 00:05:57,277
Hey, are you all right?

105
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,077
Yes, somehow...

106
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:01,777
What brings you all here?

107
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:03,777
We went to visit a friend at the hospital.

108
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:06,877
Don't tell me that he's come here because

109
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:10,177
he's aware Rena Mizunashi is hospitalized somewhere?

110
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:17,577
Isn't this Rena Mizunashi?

111
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,377
You know, the popular announcer that's on leave now?

112
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:21,377
You're right.

113
00:06:21,377 --> 00:06:23,377
She looks much younger than now, though...

114
00:06:23,377 --> 00:06:25,377
Oh, no,

115
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:26,477
she's my older sister!

116
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:28,077
Huh? Older sister?

117
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:30,377
Not! You mean that announcer!

118
00:06:30,377 --> 00:06:33,377
No, although they look alike, they're not the same person.

119
00:06:33,377 --> 00:06:35,077
Their name's are different to

120
00:06:35,077 --> 00:06:38,277
and besides, my sister left home ten years ago.

121
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:39,277
She left home?

122
00:06:39,277 --> 00:06:41,477
That's why I'm carrying this picture around

123
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:42,977
and looking for her.

124
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:45,877
But, why are you looking around hospitals?

125
00:06:45,877 --> 00:06:47,477
Sis used to always say that

126
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:50,077
she wanted to be a nurse in the future.

127
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,777
Besides, the hospital

128
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:54,477
is the place where my sister saved me many times.

129
00:06:54,477 --> 00:06:57,277
I kind of feel that she's somewhere near hospitals.

130
00:06:57,277 --> 00:07:00,077
She saved you?

131
00:07:00,077 --> 00:07:02,677
I was a klutz since I was a child, and not only that,

132
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:04,377
but also sickly,

133
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:07,377
so sis used to take me to the hospital all the time.

134
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:09,377
If I got hurt and bled, she would say,

135
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:13,277
"You've got to take good care, because God blessed with blood"

136
00:07:13,277 --> 00:07:15,677
"that you can share with everybody else."

137
00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:17,377
But, on the contrary, it turned out that

138
00:07:17,377 --> 00:07:20,477
sis was the one who shared her blood with me.

139
00:07:20,477 --> 00:07:24,277
A little before sis disappeared, I was badly wounded...

140
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:35,677
and I got a huge amount of blood transfusion from her.

141
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:38,377
The blood flowing through my body

142
00:07:38,377 --> 00:07:40,277
is my sister's.

143
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:45,777
I felt my sister's kindness each time my heart throbbed.

144
00:07:45,777 --> 00:07:47,977
However, when I was discharged from the hospital,

145
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:49,777
my sister was gone.

146
00:07:49,777 --> 00:07:52,477
Maybe she thought that if she stuck around any longer,

147
00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:54,977
she would've had to give you all her blood.

148
00:07:54,977 --> 00:07:56,777
Hey, Sonoko!

149
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:59,577
I have no idea why sis disappeared,

150
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:00,677
but I want to see her one more time

151
00:08:00,677 --> 00:08:03,277
and tell her thank you from the bottom of my heart.

152
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:06,877
After all, I'm alive now thanks to her.

153
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:11,077
A blood type that can be given to anyone.

154
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:15,377
What he just said doesn't sound like a lie.

155
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:17,277
I guess it wouldn't be wrong to say

156
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:20,477
he's looking for his older sister.

157
00:08:20,477 --> 00:08:23,777
That's just like us.

158
00:08:23,777 --> 00:08:28,777
Remember, some time back I gave you a lot of my blood too.

159
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:31,377
Can you feel my kindness too?

160
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:34,277
Yep. Sure thing...

161
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:37,677
But, isn't there a chance that Rena Mizunashi

162
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:39,877
and your older sister are one and the same?

163
00:08:39,877 --> 00:08:41,477
I don't think that's possible.

164
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:42,677
Why not?

165
00:08:42,677 --> 00:08:46,377
If she's on TV, she may not be using her real name?

166
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:47,977
Well, yes, but...

167
00:08:47,977 --> 00:08:49,477
Why don't we do this then?

168
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:53,377
One of dad's friends is a great fan of Rena Mizunashi,

169
00:08:53,377 --> 00:08:56,677
and seems to have video taped her a lot.

170
00:08:56,677 --> 00:08:58,577
So, let's ask him to show them to us!

171
00:08:58,577 --> 00:09:00,577
If you take a good look at her, it may turn out that

172
00:09:00,577 --> 00:09:01,677
she's your older sister, right?

173
00:09:01,677 --> 00:09:02,977
I guess so.

174
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:04,777
It's okay with me.

175
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,577
Right, why don't we show that picture to him too?

176
00:09:07,577 --> 00:09:10,077
We may be able to find out if it's Rena Mizunashi.

177
00:09:10,077 --> 00:09:11,777
Okay.

178
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:16,177
Yes, at any rate, let's head off.

179
00:09:16,177 --> 00:09:18,977
Before starting off, let's have lunch!

180
00:09:18,977 --> 00:09:20,277
Let's go.

181
00:09:20,277 --> 00:09:22,477
I'm really craving hamburger right now.

182
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:33,677
Yes, hello.

183
00:09:33,677 --> 00:09:36,477
Oh, long time no talk. This is Ran Mouri speaking.

184
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:38,077
Do you remember me?

185
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,977
He has a dog.

186
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:42,677
My name is Mouri.

187
00:09:42,677 --> 00:09:45,377
Excuse me, is this Mr. Anno's residence?

188
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,277
No, it isn't!

189
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:50,377
Oh no, I called the wrong number.

190
00:09:50,377 --> 00:09:51,877
Cool it.

191
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:54,577
But if Eisuke's older sister

192
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:56,277
is really Rena Mizunashi, that announcer,

193
00:09:56,277 --> 00:09:58,277
it's big news, you know.

194
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:03,377
Oh, long time no talk, this is Ran Mouri.

195
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:04,577
You again.

196
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:06,777
I'm telling you've got the wrong number!

197
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:11,477
Strange, it can't be...

198
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,677
Maybe he had to move away suddenly?

199
00:10:14,677 --> 00:10:17,077
But dad didn't say a word about it.

200
00:10:17,077 --> 00:10:19,877
Then, why don't you ask him one more time?

201
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:22,077
"Bus Stop: Horse Racing Track."

202
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:30,577
What, Anno's phone number changed?

203
00:10:30,577 --> 00:10:31,677
That can't be.

204
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:34,477
I asked him to come play mahjong just the other day.

205
00:10:34,477 --> 00:10:36,977
But, when I called, he said I had the wrong number.

206
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:38,777
Didn't he say anything about moving?

207
00:10:38,777 --> 00:10:41,577
Then, go to his parent's house and ask.

208
00:10:41,577 --> 00:10:43,377
They live near the hospital

209
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:45,777
you said you were going to visit today!

210
00:10:49,877 --> 00:10:52,977
Huh, you want to know if my son moved?

211
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:56,977
Yes, when I called a while ago, it seems that his number changed.

212
00:10:56,977 --> 00:11:00,677
Strange. I called him just a while ago.

213
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:03,777
According to my son, he said that he had a cold

214
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:05,977
and his voice sounded funny.

215
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:08,377
He also said that he had to cancel the trip

216
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:11,777
he was planning to take on Thursday and Friday.

217
00:11:11,777 --> 00:11:13,877
Oh, and he also mentioned that

218
00:11:13,877 --> 00:11:17,177
his cell phone broke yesterday, so his number changed.

219
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,677
Maybe that's it?

220
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:22,277
No, I called his residence...

221
00:11:22,277 --> 00:11:25,377
You're Mr. Mouri's daughter, right?

222
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:27,977
I'm sorry, but can we talk about this later?

223
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:29,677
I'm sort of tied up right now

224
00:11:29,677 --> 00:11:33,577
and got to rush over to the bank.

225
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:39,377
Didn't your son mention that he was in some kind of trouble?

226
00:11:39,377 --> 00:11:40,977
Yes, sort of...

227
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:43,477
And I'm sure he went on to say,

228
00:11:43,477 --> 00:11:45,477
"I don't want anybody to know about this,"

229
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:48,177
"so don't talk about it to anyone."

230
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:56,377
The fact is, one of his colleagues took company money and fled.

231
00:11:56,377 --> 00:11:59,377
He was about to start a new business and was told that

232
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:01,577
he had to deposit the money today

233
00:12:01,577 --> 00:12:04,477
or, the company itself would go bankrupt.

234
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:06,277
So, I told him I'd talk to his father first

235
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:07,577
and do something about it

236
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:09,877
but he said he had no time left.

237
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:12,477
What did he tell you to say when you go to deposit

238
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:13,977
the money into his account?

239
00:12:13,977 --> 00:12:15,977
Of course he told me to tell the bank that

240
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:18,177
this is an emergency since it's money to be used for business.

241
00:12:18,177 --> 00:12:20,377
What kind of business is it?

242
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:21,877
I think it has something to do

243
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:23,677
with a shop selling authorized Rena Mizunashi goods

244
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:24,877
or some mail order goods?

245
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,777
After all, she's popular.

246
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:29,577
I guess so. Internet shopping is also a trend right now so...

247
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:32,477
No, wrong.

248
00:12:32,477 --> 00:12:35,278
It's true that it's going around though...

249
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,349
"Anno."

250
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,395
Go... going around?

251
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:41,927
This brat must think that it's a cold going around or something.

252
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,127
No, I don't.

253
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:46,627
I just think that the person who called

254
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:49,827
doesn't want to do what you just mentioned, Sonoko.

255
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:53,327
Why not? The man on the phone was this lady's son

256
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:55,827
and a great fan of Rena Mizunashi.

257
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:58,527
And, he's the one who wants to start a business.

258
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,127
So, it's got to be a Rena Mizunashi goods shop

259
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:03,027
or an internet shopping site. Don't you think?

260
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:05,527
How can you be so sure that it's not right?

261
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:08,927
But, I wonder if your son's okay.

262
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:13,027
If his money was stolen, it has to be taken care of right away.

263
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:15,727
Yes, that's why I was thinking of going to the bank

264
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:17,227
to put up the money for now.

265
00:13:17,227 --> 00:13:20,327
Oh no, the counters will close soon!

266
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:22,727
Bye, I'm sorry. I'll talk to you later.

267
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:23,827
Wait!

268
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:27,527
Your son caught a cold and cancelled his trip, right?

269
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:29,127
Yes.

270
00:13:29,127 --> 00:13:30,827
Then, isn't something funny?

271
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:33,627
Why would he be as easygoing as to take a trip

272
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:35,227
just when he's about to start something new?

273
00:13:35,227 --> 00:13:37,227
He's going to entertain his business partners.

274
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:40,227
He was going to take the trip to entertain the people

275
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:42,427
who he would be doing business with from now.

276
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:48,127
But, he said his cell phone was broken and changed his number, right?

277
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,427
Huh? So what?

278
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:54,627
He changed his phone number since he got a new cell phone.

279
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:57,827
I mean, after all, his starting a new business, right?

280
00:13:57,827 --> 00:14:00,227
But, he called his mother yesterday,

281
00:14:00,227 --> 00:14:02,327
to tell her that his number had changed, right?

282
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:05,527
If he changes his phone number at a busy time like this,

283
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:09,627
I think that a lot of people will be troubled.

284
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:11,227
That's true.

285
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:14,127
He's got to notify all his colleagues and business partners

286
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:16,727
of his new phone number.

287
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:20,227
I don't think he would do something like that at a time like this

288
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,627
unless he had a good reason for doing so.

289
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:24,227
Then, why?

290
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:26,627
Maybe he was getting a lot of prank calls?

291
00:14:26,627 --> 00:14:27,927
Come to think of it,

292
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:31,627
he did mention getting a lot of silent calls before.

293
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:32,727
What?

294
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:35,727
He also mentioned that after that his house was broken into too.

295
00:14:35,727 --> 00:14:37,127
Broken into?

296
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:41,027
I'm sure the burglar called him to verify

297
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:43,827
whether he was home or not.

298
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:52,827
Well, he always carries his valuables around with him,

299
00:14:52,827 --> 00:14:56,227
so it seems that nothing was taken back then.

300
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:59,027
No, I think a wiretap was set up.

301
00:14:59,027 --> 00:15:01,327
Wiretap?

302
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:13,627
I think that the one who broke in set up a wiretap back then

303
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:18,027
to check out your son's way of talking and voice.

304
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:23,427
Of course he knew that your son

305
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:25,727
would be on a trip this Thursday and Friday,

306
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:28,127
and the room would be empty too!

307
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:32,027
But, he said he caught a cold and cancelled the trip.

308
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:33,727
He's in his room right now.

309
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:36,027
Was the man really your son?

310
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:40,227
Yes, I'm sure. I thought that his voice was hoarse

311
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:42,127
because of his cold.

312
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:45,027
The phone number that was displayed was his house phone too.

313
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,427
There was also a dog barking. The dog barks a lot.

314
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:50,827
It's always barking bow-wow near the phone.

315
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:52,927
But a dog's bark is even more difficult to distinguish

316
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:54,927
than the voice of people, is it?

317
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:56,827
He probably made a dog with the same kind of voice

318
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:58,627
bark near the phone...

319
00:15:58,627 --> 00:16:02,127
No, it could've been a tape or CD.

320
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,427
Huh, why would he go all out like that for?

321
00:16:05,427 --> 00:16:09,127
So that you would completely believe that he's your son.

322
00:16:09,127 --> 00:16:10,727
Hey, wait!

323
00:16:10,727 --> 00:16:15,627
Don't tell me it's a bank transfer scam?

324
00:16:15,627 --> 00:16:18,227
Because he's calling under the pretense of your son

325
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,127
and says he needs the money right away.

326
00:16:20,127 --> 00:16:23,527
But, it's just this brat's imagination.

327
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:27,027
No, he's got a point, though!

328
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,427
If the culprit snuck into your son's room and is calling from there,

329
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:33,727
the number displayed on your screen would be that of your son's.

330
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:37,427
Furthermore, if he made you listen to the dog bark in the background...

331
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:42,627
He would completely deceive you into thinking he is your son.

332
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:46,427
Then, why did he say, "wrong number" when I called?

333
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:50,727
You again, I said you have the wrong number!

334
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:54,427
Maybe that man was waiting for you to call.

335
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:56,427
Yes, I guess so.

336
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:59,827
He said to call him as soon as I transferred the money.

337
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:01,427
I'm sure that he was going to inform the others

338
00:17:01,427 --> 00:17:03,027
that you transferred the money,

339
00:17:03,027 --> 00:17:06,427
so that they could withdraw the money right away and flee.

340
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,527
I guess he didn't have the time to be answering a call

341
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:12,027
from somebody else at a time like this,

342
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:14,227
and still pretend to be your son.

343
00:17:14,227 --> 00:17:17,927
Moreover, he called you just before the closing time of the bank.

344
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:20,227
The more time you don't give the target to think,

345
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:23,127
the more successful this scam works.

346
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:25,327
Of course, he tells you not to talk about it to anyone

347
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:27,327
to keep you from realizing that it's a scam.

348
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:28,627
He told you to tell the teller

349
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:32,127
that it's money to be used for business, for the same reason.

350
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:33,727
This scam is widespread now,

351
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:35,127
that unless you say something like that,

352
00:17:35,127 --> 00:17:38,527
the teller will get suspicious too.

353
00:17:38,527 --> 00:17:42,027
I heard all this on the "Afternoon Wide Show" TV program.

354
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:45,227
You sure remember a lot of things, like usual, don't you, Conan?

355
00:17:45,227 --> 00:17:47,427
You're just like a housewife who has nothing better than

356
00:17:47,427 --> 00:17:48,927
to watch TV in the afternoon.

357
00:17:48,927 --> 00:17:50,927
Which means that his cell phone breaking

358
00:17:50,927 --> 00:17:54,127
and his phone number being changed are probably all lies.

359
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:55,827
He said all this so that you won't try to

360
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:57,827
get a hold of your son who is on a trip.

361
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:02,527
Yep, so I think you can find out right away if this is a scam or not

362
00:18:02,527 --> 00:18:06,627
by calling your son's original cell phone number!

363
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:10,527
The number you have called

364
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:13,727
is either not within service range or switched off

365
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:15,127
so cannot be connected.

366
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,827
-The number you have called... -Oh my, it won't connect.

367
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:23,627
Then, does it mean that it's true that his cell phone broke?

368
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:25,727
Where did your son go?

369
00:18:25,727 --> 00:18:27,927
Sado, in Niigata.

370
00:18:27,927 --> 00:18:31,027
I think he was scheduled to come home by 7:00 tonight.

371
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,527
7:00...

372
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:37,027
It takes an hour from Sado to Tokyo on the Jet Foil.

373
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:40,427
Then, it takes 2 hours and a half from Niigata on the Bullet train.

374
00:18:40,427 --> 00:18:42,827
Calculating backwards,

375
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:46,227
he should be on board the Jet Foil and out at sea.

376
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:49,727
Sometimes cell phones are out of the service area if you're out at sea.

377
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,827
So, the culprit had all that figured out too.

378
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:56,327
I've got less than ten minutes.

379
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:58,927
I've got to go to the bank for sure this time!

380
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:00,627
No, don't go, Ma'am!

381
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:02,327
You're persistent, aren't you?

382
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:05,027
My son's saying that if he can't get hold of 10 million yen by today,

383
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:06,527
he's going to have to borrow it from loan sharks.

384
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:10,527
If he does so, then there'll be no turning back.

385
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:18,627
"Beika Central Bank."

386
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:27,527
What? You couldn't transfer the money?

387
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:29,627
No, because I had some sudden guests

388
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,127
and couldn't get to it right away.

389
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:32,427
I'm really sorry.

390
00:19:32,427 --> 00:19:35,127
I told you to hurry it up.

391
00:19:35,127 --> 00:19:38,427
You should've left right away after my call.

392
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,527
But, you did say that

393
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:42,027
you were going to the loan shark for the cash,

394
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:44,027
so I guess all you have to do is come up with the money for today

395
00:19:44,027 --> 00:19:45,627
for the moment, right?

396
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:47,827
Yeah, I guess so.

397
00:19:50,227 --> 00:19:53,327
Will my sugar-bowl savings be able to cover for the time being then?

398
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:55,727
Sugar-bowl savings? How much?

399
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,827
I was saving up just in case, for times like this.

400
00:19:57,827 --> 00:19:59,527
I've got about 2 million yen.

401
00:19:59,527 --> 00:20:02,927
I sent you the card together with the pass code yesterday

402
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:06,527
so that you can withdraw the money, so it should already be there.

403
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,127
Won't that do?

404
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:10,927
Yeah, I guess I can make do for the time being.

405
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:14,227
I'll go withdraw the cash right now.

406
00:20:14,227 --> 00:20:16,727
I'm sorry I yelled at you, Mom.

407
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,927
Who are you?

408
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:31,927
Well... you see.

409
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:34,427
Darn it! Move it!

410
00:20:54,527 --> 00:21:01,127
So, the culprit of the bank transfer scam was arrested right away.

411
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,627
His accomplice who was waiting for the transfer at the bank

412
00:21:03,627 --> 00:21:05,127
was also arrested,

413
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:07,327
and this alleged bank transfer scam was prevented

414
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:09,627
before any damage was done.

415
00:21:09,627 --> 00:21:12,227
In other words, the simplest and most effective method

416
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:14,627
of not being taken in by such scams

417
00:21:14,627 --> 00:21:17,027
is to not make rash decisions alone.

418
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,827
And, though it doesn't matter who, talk about it to somebody!

419
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:22,227
By putting the situation into words and explaining,

420
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:23,727
you can organize the situation

421
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:26,727
and take in the situation more calmly.

422
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:29,427
This way, if they or the person they discuss with

423
00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:31,227
are even a little bit suspicious...

424
00:21:31,227 --> 00:21:33,727
This kind of scam can be prevented.

425
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:46,227
Mom.

426
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:50,027
What? You were targeted by a bank transfer scam!

427
00:21:50,027 --> 00:21:51,827
You, mom!

428
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:55,327
Yes. But, these children kept me from being deceived.

429
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:58,027
It's been a long time. I'm Ran Mouri.

430
00:21:58,027 --> 00:21:59,727
Hi Aina, long time no see.

431
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:03,627
Oh, I see, you're Mr. Mouri's...

432
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:07,127
But, what brings you here?

433
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:09,427
We came to see you.

434
00:22:09,427 --> 00:22:12,927
We have a favor to ask you, sir.

435
00:22:12,927 --> 00:22:14,027
This person.

436
00:22:14,027 --> 00:22:17,427
We want you to take a look at Rena Mizunashi's picture.

437
00:23:51,627 --> 00:23:53,227
Are Eisuke Hondo's older sister

438
00:23:53,227 --> 00:23:56,127
and Rena Mizunashi the same person?

439
00:23:56,127 --> 00:23:58,527
It turns out that Eisuke emphatically denied this fact

440
00:23:58,527 --> 00:24:01,427
because of the difference in their blood type.

441
00:24:01,427 --> 00:24:03,627
Rena Mizunashi's blood type is AB,

442
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:05,127
Eisuke who says that he once had blood transfusion from his sister,

443
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:07,827
whose blood type is O.

444
00:24:07,827 --> 00:24:10,927
When we arrive at a big mansion in order to confirm the truth,

445
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:13,427
we encounter a mystery of a new incident.

446
00:24:15,127 --> 00:24:17,227
Next on Detective Conan,

447
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:20,927
"Red and Black Crash: Kin."

448
00:24:36,627 --> 00:24:38,827
Next Conan's Hint:

449
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:41,127
Blood transfusion.

450
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:42,627
Ran, what blood type are you?

451
00:24:42,627 --> 00:24:43,927
The same as Shinichi's.

452
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:45,927
Me too... I mean, of course.
