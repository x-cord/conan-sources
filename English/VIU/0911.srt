but naturally, we could still prosecute.

Now that you mention it, I remember that case.

78
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:58,115
A burglar entered a home in Sasago-cho.

79
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:00,615
After staying there for over an hour,

80
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:04,315
he stole about 500 thousand yen in cash.

81
00:06:04,315 --> 00:06:09,915
The burglar's face wasn't seen but Maihama claims it was him.

82
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:15,915
While I was there, I had something to drink and eat.

83
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:18,715
It's true that the burglar drank and ate.

84
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:23,615
The teeth marks we collected from the food matched Maihama's.

85
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:26,415
We even found the 500 thousand yen he hid.

86
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,815
Maihama was definitely the burglar.

87
00:06:33,815 --> 00:06:38,915
But if that's true, then he has an alibi.

88
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:40,015
An alibi?

89
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:41,715
How?

90
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:46,215
The burglar entered the home in Sasago-cho at 7 pm.

91
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:49,215
Since he was there for over an hour,

92
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:51,915
he left after 8 pm.

93
00:06:51,915 --> 00:06:56,115
Meanwhile, Reigan was murdered in his home in Yotsubadai

94
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,915
around 8 pm as well.

95
00:06:57,915 --> 00:07:00,415
It takes over an hour by car to travel

96
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:02,915
between Sasago-cho and Yotsubadai.

97
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:06,415
So it was impossible for Maihama to murder Reigan.

98
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:11,115
But, Inspector... There's a witness who says

99
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:14,215
he saw Maihama at the crime scene at the time of the murder.

100
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:17,815
Yesterday, that witness said...

101
00:07:17,815 --> 00:07:21,115
I actually lied about seeing him.

102
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:22,815
What?

103
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:25,915
He seemed like a bad guy when I saw him at the bar,

104
00:07:25,915 --> 00:07:28,115
so I thought I'd frame him.

105
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,915
But I felt guilty about it.

106
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:33,115
I'm sorry for making it up.

107
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:34,915
-He made it up? -He made it up?

108
00:07:34,915 --> 00:07:37,315
Furthermore, regarding the knife...

109
00:07:37,315 --> 00:07:40,815
I bought it to use during the burglary.

110
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:44,715
I buried it behind my apartment building after I used it.

111
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,615
This is it.

112
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:51,415
It's the same as the one found in Reigan's body.

113
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:54,415
He must've planned all of it

114
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:56,815
so he wouldn't lose his inheritance

115
00:07:56,815 --> 00:07:59,415
and to avoid being convicted of murder.

116
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:02,015
It's too convenient.

117
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:06,215
It's obvious he'd be a suspect if Reigan were murdered

118
00:08:06,215 --> 00:08:08,615
so he allowed himself to be arrested

119
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:12,115
so he could overturn it.

120
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:14,815
The witness who went back on his testimony

121
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:17,315
is working with him, of course.

122
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:22,215
He probably just bought another one of these knives.

123
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:27,915
I know he committed the burglary to create an alibi.

124
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:33,315
The problem is how in two locations, separated by an hour's travel,

125
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:37,015
a single human committed a burglary in Sasago-cho

126
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:40,015
while murdering Reigan in Yotsubadai.

127
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:42,015
Unless we can solve that,

128
00:08:42,015 --> 00:08:44,815
even if we can prosecute him for the burglary,

129
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:49,115
which was material evidence, we can't prosecute him for Reigan's murder.

130
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:55,815
So we spent all day yesterday trying to solve the problem.

131
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:59,315
However, we ran into a dead end.

132
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,115
That's why I'm asking for your help!

133
00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:09,515
Inspector, I, Kogoro Mouri, shall assist you!

134
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:13,015
Honestly, I have no faith in you.

135
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:17,915
But when you're asleep, your detective skills become mind-boggling.

136
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:20,715
Well, I'm not sure how to respond to that.

137
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:23,615
A burglary and a murder

138
00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:26,315
in two different places at the same time.

139
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:36,015
I've got it, Inspector.

140
00:09:36,015 --> 00:09:40,415
Immediately after committing the burglary in Sasago-cho,

141
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:43,615
he killed Reigan who he'd asked to meet him nearby.

142
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:46,615
Then he put the body in a car

143
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:50,015
and drove it to Reigan's home in Yotsubadai.

144
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:53,115
Listen, Mouri.

145
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:55,515
Wouldn't the forensics team have noticed

146
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:59,615
if the body had been moved?

147
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:03,215
Reigan was murdered inside his own home.

148
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:07,215
There's no sign the murder was staged.

149
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:10,815
If anything was staged, it was the burglary.

150
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:14,615
Of course. Go away.

151
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,915
About the burglary.

152
00:10:17,915 --> 00:10:22,515
It's strange that he stayed there for an entire hour.

153
00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:28,315
We're certain that the burglar entered the home in Sasago-cho at 7 pm.

154
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:30,615
Hide Tenyama, who lives alone,

155
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:35,915
had just begun to watch the 7 pm news while eating dinner.

156
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:37,015
Don't move.

157
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:39,015
Move and I'll kill you.

158
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:44,915
"Hide Tenyama (73), Victim" -And I don't want you seeing my face.

159
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:47,915
Where's the money?

160
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:51,315
Don't underestimate me!

161
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:55,115
Though she tried to tell him where she kept her money,

162
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:58,315
Ms. Hide was suddenly struck and lost consciousness.

163
00:10:58,315 --> 00:11:01,915
She awoke an hour later at 8 pm.

164
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:06,615
She heard the sounds of a TV show that starts at 8 pm.

165
00:11:08,615 --> 00:11:10,415
You're finally awake.

166
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:11,515
I looked for your money,

167
00:11:11,515 --> 00:11:13,915
but I couldn't find it, so I've been waiting.

168
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:15,515
Where's the money?

169
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:18,715
In the middle drawer of the dresser.

170
00:11:18,715 --> 00:11:23,315
Thank you. I can't have you calling the police right away.

171
00:11:26,815 --> 00:11:31,215
The second time Ms. Hide awoke was the next morning.

172
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:39,815
What is this?

173
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:44,015
The money! The money in the dresser!

174
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,515
Hello, police?

175
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:52,015
I've been...

176
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:54,115
I've been burglarized!

177
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:01,815
I see. So that's how it is.

178
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:04,515
Hey, Pops.

179
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,015
I've figured it out, Inspector.

180
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,115
Huh?

181
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:08,315
Really?

182
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:11,415
Maihama stepped out for a while.

183
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:13,415
There are two points to focus on.

184
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:16,115
First, that Maihama blindfolded Ms. Hide,

185
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:19,415
and second, that he knocked her out twice.

186
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:21,715
Don't underestimate me!

187
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:25,615
After entering at 7 pm and knocking Ms. Hide unconscious,

188
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:27,315
Maihama recorded the TV program.

189
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:33,215
He quickly drove to Yotsubadai and murdered Reigan.

190
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:35,215
It happened after 8 pm.

191
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:40,015
Then he returned to Sasago-cho,

192
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:43,015
replayed the video he recorded,

193
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:46,515
and woke Ms. Hide.

194
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,715
It was probably after 9 pm by then,

195
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:54,115
but because of the audio of the TV show Maihama recorded,

196
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:56,515
he made her believe it was 8 pm.

197
00:12:56,515 --> 00:12:59,815
In the middle drawer of the dresser.

198
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:03,315
Then he knocked out Ms. Hide again,

199
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:08,015
and made it appear as though he'd been there for an hour.

200
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:09,415
In other words,

201
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:12,915
Maihama wasn't in Ms. Hide's home the whole time after he entered.

202
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:16,515
He left and traveled back and forth to Yotsubadai

203
00:13:16,515 --> 00:13:19,815
while Ms. Hide was knocked out.

204
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:23,815
Amazing. That's perfect, Pops.

205
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:26,515
This is the first time the Inspector's asked for my help.

206
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,915
How could I disappoint him?

207
00:13:28,915 --> 00:13:30,215
Mouri.

208
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:35,015
No, it was an honor to serve you.

209
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:39,315
Actually, we considered that possibility.

210
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:40,915
However, it's impossible.

211
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:41,915
Huh?

212
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:47,815
I forgot to mention that when Ms. Hide Tenyama awoke,

213
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:50,015
she heard not only the sounds of the TV show,

214
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:53,515
but also a fire truck siren.

215
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:59,415
Maihama demanded the location of the money while she could hear that.

216
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:01,115
We confirmed with the fire department

217
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:03,915
that 8 pm was the only time

218
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:06,215
a fire truck was dispatched in Sasago-cho that night.

219
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,615
Which means...

220
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:13,115
Yeah. Maihama never left.

221
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:14,815
No way.

222
00:14:16,415 --> 00:14:21,415
If he didn't want his face to be seen, he only needed to wear a mask.

223
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:26,515
There must be some reason he blocked Ms. Hide's vision.

224
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:29,215
But why?

225
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:37,826
The question is at 8 pm that night,

226
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:42,126
Ryuji Maihama was threatening Ms. Hide Tenyama in Sasago-cho.

227
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:46,326
So how did he kill Reigan in Yotsubadai?

228
00:14:48,326 --> 00:14:51,026
Is it not coming yet?

229
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:53,126
What? Who's coming?

230
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:58,626
Not who, but those weird exclamations you always make.

231
00:14:58,626 --> 00:15:01,526
It's not that convenient.

232
00:15:02,726 --> 00:15:04,626
But, Inspector,

233
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:09,726
are we sure Ms. Hide heard the fire truck siren?

234
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:13,626
Yeah. We checked with her, so I'm certain of it.

235
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:15,926
Yes. I know I heard it.

236
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:20,426
And I smelled something burning.

237
00:15:20,426 --> 00:15:23,026
Smelled something burning?

238
00:15:23,026 --> 00:15:26,926
It doesn't make sense that she smelled anything though.

239
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,626
Apparently it was a prank call.

240
00:15:30,626 --> 00:15:34,826
In other words, there was no fire.

241
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:36,226
Yeah.

242
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,726
But a fire truck was still dispatched.

243
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:44,226
Maybe hearing the siren made her think she smelled something.

244
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:46,326
Probably.

245
00:15:46,326 --> 00:15:50,026
She seemed to have it together but she's an old woman.

246
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:52,526
She was confused about all sorts of things.

247
00:15:52,526 --> 00:15:55,226
Did she mention something else?

248
00:15:55,226 --> 00:15:56,226
Yeah.

249
00:15:56,226 --> 00:15:59,326
She claimed she didn't hear a sound she expected to hear.

250
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:02,026
I heard the TV and the siren,

251
00:16:02,026 --> 00:16:05,826
but I didn't hear the bathtub notification.

252
00:16:05,826 --> 00:16:08,926
I set it to be ready at 8 pm.

253
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,426
Strange, isn't it?

254
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:11,726
I see.

255
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:14,026
Maybe she just missed it.

256
00:16:14,026 --> 00:16:15,726
Probably.

257
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:18,826
Anyway, is it still not coming, Mouri?

258
00:16:18,826 --> 00:16:22,026
-What? -Get sleepy already.

259
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:26,326
But I got plenty of sleep last night.

260
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:29,126
You're unbelievable.

261
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:33,226
It reminds me of all the cases that were nearly unsolved because of you.

262
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:39,526
I'm not responsible for this case.

263
00:16:39,526 --> 00:16:43,926
Today's the last day we have left, Mouri.

264
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:47,626
At this rate, we're going to have to drop the charges,

265
00:16:47,626 --> 00:16:50,226
even though we know he's the culprit!

266
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:55,726
Yes, this is Megure.

267
00:16:55,726 --> 00:16:57,626
I know that.

268
00:16:57,626 --> 00:17:00,526
Mouri's doing his best right now.

269
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:02,726
Have some faith in your senior.

270
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:05,726
Darn it. If only I hadn't slept so deeply last night.

271
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:10,626
We're just wasting time.

272
00:17:10,626 --> 00:17:14,426
Take me to the burglary investigation.

273
00:17:14,426 --> 00:17:18,726
Personally, I wish I could admit to killing my uncle,

274
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:22,526
but I have an alibi.

275
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:30,726
If I drink...

276
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:35,426
and stuff myself, I should start to feel sleepy.

277
00:17:35,426 --> 00:17:39,626
Gosh. Pops is confused.

278
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,826
Confused?

279
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:44,126
Was Ms. Hide really confused, too?

280
00:17:45,526 --> 00:17:49,926
If Ms. Hide's perception wasn't wrong, what then?

281
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:54,326
That's it. So that's how it is.

282
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:55,526
Hey, Pops.

283
00:17:55,526 --> 00:17:59,626
What if everything Ms. Hide said is right?

284
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:04,326
And if you consider the culprit blindfolded Ms. Hide

285
00:18:04,326 --> 00:18:06,826
and knocked her out twice,

286
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:09,126
does anything become clear?

287
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:11,526
It's here!

288
00:18:11,526 --> 00:18:13,726
Is it?

289
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,126
The bathroom!

290
00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:20,026
I was stupid to think I could count on him.

291
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:22,026
Don't go, Inspector.

292
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:24,726
But I can't stay here forever.

293
00:18:24,726 --> 00:18:26,726
Just hold on.

294
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:33,426
Oh, I see.

295
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:36,026
He seems to have had an epiphany.

296
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:37,426
Really?

297
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:40,026
Anyway, he wants you to check

298
00:18:40,026 --> 00:18:44,026
if any fire trucks were dispatched to Yotsubadai that night.

299
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:45,926
Got it.

300
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:54,426
Yes. I see.

301
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,026
Got it.

302
00:18:56,026 --> 00:19:00,526
A truck responded to a small fire at 8 pm.

303
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:01,726
That's it.

304
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:04,126
Huh? What are you talking about?

305
00:19:07,926 --> 00:19:09,926
Is this it, Mouri?

306
00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:11,926
Yes. I feel refreshed after using the bathroom.

307
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:13,826
The mystery is clear to me now.

308
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:16,526
I'm glad I didn't leave.

309
00:19:16,526 --> 00:19:21,226
Cutting to the chase, Inspector, Maihama did leave.

310
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,226
What? I told you, that's impossible.

311
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:26,626
Not alone.

312
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:29,126
He took Ms. Hide Tenyama with him.

313
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,326
What? What does that mean?

314
00:19:32,326 --> 00:19:36,526
After entering Ms. Hide's home at 7 pm...

315
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:37,626
Don't underestimate me!

316
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:42,526
He knocked her out and headed to Yotsubadai

317
00:19:42,526 --> 00:19:46,926
with the unconscious Ms. Hide in the car.

318
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:49,126
Then he murdered Reigan

319
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:52,026
and started a small fire nearby.

320
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:54,226
Then he called the fire department.

321
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:58,926
He also called in a false report to the Sasago-cho fire department.

322
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:05,026
As he heard the fire truck approaching,

323
00:20:05,026 --> 00:20:11,726
Maihama turned on the TV in his car and woke Ms. Hide.

324
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:13,726
You're finally awake.

325
00:20:15,326 --> 00:20:17,026
I looked for your money,

326
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:19,626
but I couldn't find it, so I've been waiting.

327
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:21,826
After getting the money's location out of her,

328
00:20:21,826 --> 00:20:24,426
he knocked her out again.

329
00:20:24,426 --> 00:20:28,026
He took Ms. Hide back to her home in Sasago-cho,

330
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,026
placed her in her original position,

331
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:33,026
and made it seem as though he was there the whole time.

332
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:37,426
In other words, Maihama blindfolded Ms. Hide

333
00:20:37,426 --> 00:20:40,126
not to confuse her about the time,

334
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:42,926
but to make her believe she heard the TV and siren

335
00:20:42,926 --> 00:20:45,726
in her home in Sasago-cho,

336
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:47,626
so she wouldn't realize

337
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:50,226
she was actually in a car parked in Yotsubadai.

338
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:51,626
I see.

339
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,226
Ms. Hide Tenyama believes

340
00:20:53,226 --> 00:20:56,726
she was in her own home the whole time, but...

341
00:20:56,726 --> 00:21:02,126
She was taken back and forth to Yotsubadai while she was unconscious

342
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:04,626
so she would confirm Maihama's alibi.

343
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:10,826
However, Maihama ended up leaving evidence of his scheme.

344
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:13,126
Ms. Hide's nose and ears.

345
00:21:14,026 --> 00:21:16,426
She smelled the small fire,

346
00:21:16,426 --> 00:21:21,926
"Bath is ready" -and she didn't hear her bathtub's notification.

347
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:26,226
If you examine Maihama's car again,

348
00:21:26,226 --> 00:21:28,926
I'm sure you'll find evidence that Ms. Hide was inside.

349
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:37,426
Hello, it's me. We've destroyed Maihama's alibi.

350
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:40,026
Thoroughly investigate his car.

351
00:21:40,026 --> 00:21:45,826
That's right. Your senior didn't let us down.

353
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:12,026
Mouri, thanks for the help.

354
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:13,926
I should get going.

355
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:16,726
I solved the mystery, Inspector.

356
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:20,826
Maihama has a twin with identical teeth prints.

357
00:23:20,826 --> 00:23:24,226
-While he was committing the burglary... -What?

358
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:27,626
-What are you doing? -I don't know what I was expecting.

359
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:31,026
This is the only time I'm asking him for help.

360
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:35,626
Inspector, what about Maihama's alibi?

361
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:37,526
Maihama is...

362
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:40,426
This was supposed to have a good ending.

"Next Episode" -What? Conan is a witness in a murder case?

364
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:52,126
We're also considering the possibility of theft as we investigate,

365
00:23:52,126 --> 00:23:57,326
but to be on the safe side, we're checking everyone's alibi.

366
00:23:57,326 --> 00:23:59,026
-Look. -So many mountains.

367
00:24:01,526 --> 00:24:04,326
That's where we got the drawing done.

368
00:24:05,426 --> 00:24:06,526
It's right here.
