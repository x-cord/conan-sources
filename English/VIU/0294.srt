1
00:00:00,758 --> 00:00:02,657
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,658 --> 00:00:04,557
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,558 --> 00:00:06,457
A Land of Fire Cup Charity Tennis Tournament in Kumamoto.

4
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:08,257
A cellphone's text message causes big trouble for Ran.

5
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,057
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:11,957
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,958
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,442 --> 00:01:57,942
"Mount Aso."

9
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:06,498
We are on board our plane flying to Kumamoto.

10
00:02:06,523 --> 00:02:08,222
We headed there to enter a tennis match

11
00:02:08,223 --> 00:02:11,222
that Genta won in a lottery.

12
00:02:11,223 --> 00:02:13,322
Ran and Pops is with us as our guardian

13
00:02:13,323 --> 00:02:17,022
and Sonoko has also come along paying her own way.

14
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:20,522
Just as would be expected of the daughter of the Suzuki financial group.

15
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:23,022
And, this time there is one more person who came along with us.

16
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:26,022
It's not usual for her to come along on something like this.

17
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:28,022
Want anything?

18
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,422
Oh, well, no.

19
00:02:29,423 --> 00:02:30,822
Okay.

20
00:02:30,823 --> 00:02:35,322
Usually you're not interested in these stuff and didn't join us,

21
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:38,222
so I was wondering why you tag along this time.

22
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:41,822
There's no special reason why I came along.

23
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:46,022
It's because Dr. Agasa kept bugging me to go.

24
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:47,222
And besides...

25
00:02:47,223 --> 00:02:51,123
Unless I stay near you, you can't protect me, can you?

26
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:54,623
Only joking.

27
00:02:55,623 --> 00:02:56,923
Oh boy.

28
00:02:58,423 --> 00:03:04,222
"Smash of Love and Resolve (Part 1)"

29
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:07,223
"Kumamoto Airport."

30
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:15,623
"The First Land of Fire Cup Charity Tennis Tournament."

31
00:03:16,423 --> 00:03:17,822
Here we are.

32
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,322
It's Kyushu!

33
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:21,022
It's Kumamoto!

34
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:22,723
Shochu liquor!

35
00:03:28,623 --> 00:03:31,023
Just as expected of your dad, Ran.

36
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:33,622
Come on, dad.

37
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:36,922
Let's hurry and rent a car and go to the hotel.

38
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:37,923
Hey.

39
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:39,722
-Hold it. -We bring to you

40
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:40,922
the Land of Fire Cup Charity Tennis Tournament.

41
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:43,822
Playing the semi-finals will be,

42
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,022
-First match, -It's Kyohei Mabuchi.

43
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:48,422
-Kyohei Mabuchi a local of Kumamoto... -You're right.

44
00:03:48,423 --> 00:03:50,822
-vs. America's Richard Woodbridge. -Awesome.

45
00:03:50,823 --> 00:03:52,722
-The match will start from 11:00 am. -You're still kids.

46
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:55,922
-The second match will be played... -The one who's really awesome is...

47
00:03:55,923 --> 00:03:59,222
by Masato Tachikawa, also a local of Kumamoto

48
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:01,722
-vs. Michael Owen of England, -Masahito!

49
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:05,322
which will begin at 2:00 pm.

50
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:09,322
We could never beat him, though.

51
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:12,222
Come on, Genta.

52
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:15,022
We're entering the junior match,

53
00:04:15,023 --> 00:04:17,822
but they'reall professionals.

54
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:21,722
We would never end up playing those people.

55
00:04:21,723 --> 00:04:23,022
Oh, really?

56
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:24,722
Right, Genta.

57
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,022
What a bummer.

58
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:29,523
I was kind of hoping to play against them.

59
00:04:35,323 --> 00:04:38,023
"Ninomaru Park."

60
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:50,522
It so spacious and feels good.

61
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,222
Yeah.

62
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:55,222
Kids sure are active no matter what they do.

63
00:04:55,223 --> 00:04:58,922
Really, training as soon as they get here.

64
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,222
It's so nice to be young.

65
00:05:01,223 --> 00:05:04,222
You're talking like you're some middle-aged woman or something.

66
00:05:04,223 --> 00:05:05,622
What are you doing, Genta?

67
00:05:05,623 --> 00:05:07,623
I'm...

68
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:13,722
Let's rest a while.

69
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:15,322
Just what are you talking about?

70
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:17,322
The match is tomorrow.

71
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:20,923
We've come to Kumamoto to win.

72
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:25,422
But, where's Mr. Mouri?

73
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:28,722
You're right, Ai's not around either.

74
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:32,223
Well, I do have an idea where they are, though.

75
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:38,823
Spicy lotus root, raw horse meat and shochu liquor.

76
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:41,823
Viva Kumamoto.

77
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,623
I can't take it anymore.

78
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:03,123
Let's take a five minute break, then.

79
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,722
Only five minutes?

80
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:08,822
-Are you serious? -Of course.

81
00:06:08,823 --> 00:06:12,922
Mitsuhiko, why don't we call it a day for training

82
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:16,622
and go look around since we've come all the way to Kumamoto.

83
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:18,722
Agreed. Agreed.

84
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:20,723
I'm starving too.

85
00:06:22,723 --> 00:06:24,622
Hey, Mitsuhiko?

86
00:06:24,623 --> 00:06:27,222
Besides, we don't want anybody to overwork themselves

87
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:28,822
and get hurt or something just before the match, do we?

88
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:31,422
But, Ran...

89
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,222
I know how you feel about wanting to win,

90
00:06:34,223 --> 00:06:36,922
but participating in the game is what counts.

91
00:06:36,923 --> 00:06:38,423
Have you ever heard this phrase?

92
00:06:39,423 --> 00:06:42,722
I think it's more important to give it all we've got

93
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:45,522
and to try our best,

94
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:47,823
rather than we win the game or not.

95
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:52,122
Okay.

96
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:54,922
All right! Let's go eat eels over rice.

97
00:06:54,923 --> 00:06:56,422
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:59,823
Pork bones noodle is what Kumamoto is famous for.

99
00:07:01,523 --> 00:07:03,222
Ran.

100
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,723
You'll become a good mother.

101
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:19,323
"The Kumamoto Castle."

102
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:36,023
"Suizenji Park."

103
00:07:44,623 --> 00:07:46,223
What is it, Sonoko?

104
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:49,322
Look what I found.

105
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:50,822
Isn't that a cell phone?

106
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:52,822
We've got to turn it into the police right away.

107
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:53,823
Yeah.

108
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:57,322
It's vibrating.

109
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:58,323
Mail?

110
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:00,323
Yeah, I think so.

111
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:02,922
Shall we take a look at it?

112
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:05,422
No, we shouldn't peek into other people's mail.

113
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:06,922
Who cares?

114
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:09,222
Besides, it may be from the owner of this cell phone, right?

115
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,223
Hey, don't.

116
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:16,222
It says, "Sonoko. I want to see you."

117
00:08:16,223 --> 00:08:18,222
It's a love mail.

118
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:20,222
You're blushed.

119
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,822
Hey, what's up, Sonoko?

120
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:23,922
Well...

121
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:26,022
It's nothing, really.

122
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:28,522
This is not kid's stuff.

123
00:08:28,523 --> 00:08:29,523
You better watch out,

124
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:32,622
the police may scold you for looking at other people's mail.

125
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:35,822
Never mind. The other kids are waiting for you over there.

126
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:37,023
Hurry and go on over there.

127
00:08:39,023 --> 00:08:43,022
At any rate, we've got to hurry and take it to the police.

128
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,722
What're you talking about?

129
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:48,722
We're going to deliver this in person tomorrow

130
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:50,323
to the person who sent this mail.

131
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,922
But, we've got the tennis match tomorrow.

132
00:08:53,923 --> 00:08:55,122
Don't worry.

133
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:58,022
See, this Prefectural Athletic Park

134
00:08:58,023 --> 00:09:01,122
is where the the tennis match is going to be held.

135
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,222
Oh, right.

136
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:03,223
See?

137
00:09:03,224 --> 00:09:06,822
So, it won't hurt to leave for just a while.

138
00:09:06,823 --> 00:09:08,422
I guess so.

139
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,922
That's it. Tomorrow we'll see how this love

140
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:13,923
as well as the tennis match goes.

141
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:26,622
Finally, tomorrow is the day.

142
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:28,122
Are going to be okay?

143
00:09:28,123 --> 00:09:30,722
Yeah, of course.

144
00:09:30,723 --> 00:09:32,423
I give you my word.

145
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:40,323
We will now begin

146
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:46,222
the First Land of Fire Cup Charity Tennis Tournament Junior Match.

147
00:09:46,223 --> 00:09:47,922
Before the start of the game,

148
00:09:47,923 --> 00:09:51,222
I, Kenzo Narimasu, Chairman of this tournament

149
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,022
would like to give a welcome speech.

150
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:55,522
"Kenzo Narimasu (60)" -to the guardians of the contestants.

151
00:09:55,523 --> 00:09:58,122
"Congressman" -as well as all the spectators here.

152
00:09:58,123 --> 00:10:01,322
I am being suspected at present

153
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:05,622
for something that I have no knowledge of whatsoever, but...

154
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:06,922
I swear to God that i am innocent...

155
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:08,822
-of all such dubious acts. -What's with that man?

156
00:10:08,823 --> 00:10:12,322
He's talking about something irrelevant to tennis.

157
00:10:12,323 --> 00:10:16,122
He looks awfully familiar, though.

158
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:18,222
You probably some him on TV.

159
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:19,722
He's Kenzo Narimasu,

160
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:21,622
a congressman who was elected

161
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:23,122
from Kumamoto that has recently been talked about a lot

162
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,722
regarding his corrupted acts.

163
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:28,022
Oh, yes, I've heard of him.

164
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:30,622
The other day, his secretary called Saiki took on all the guilt

165
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:32,722
and committed suicide, right?

166
00:10:32,723 --> 00:10:33,922
Yeah.

167
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:36,822
So, in order to gain back his reputation with the public,

168
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:39,922
he offered to be sponsor for this tournament.

169
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:41,723
The usual stuff.

170
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,623
"The Youth Detective Squad 2 vs Little Kids Club 1."

171
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:03,923
"Gas Buzz 0 vs The Youth Detective Squad 2."

172
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:08,723
"The Youth Detective Squad 2 vs Kashiwa Boys 1."

173
00:11:11,323 --> 00:11:13,522
"Takumi Club 0 vs The Youth Detective Squad 2."

174
00:11:13,523 --> 00:11:15,122
We did it.

175
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:17,522
Really, I don't believe it.

176
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:19,822
Great victory for the Youth Detective Squad.

177
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:22,422
Good work and welcome back everybody.

178
00:11:22,423 --> 00:11:23,922
Were you watching us, Ai?

179
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:26,322
Yes, you're all pretty good.

180
00:11:26,323 --> 00:11:28,322
Now, we get to go on to the semi-finals.

181
00:11:28,323 --> 00:11:29,822
We've already come this far.

182
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:33,023
Victory of the Youth Detective Squad!

183
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:38,622
Hey, where are Ran and Sonoko?

184
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:43,122
I wonder they went sneaking off just a while ago.

185
00:11:43,123 --> 00:11:44,323
I see.

186
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:48,923
"Cafe Athlete."

187
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:52,022
There's nobody who looks to be the owner.

188
00:11:52,023 --> 00:11:53,422
Nope.

189
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:54,922
Should we mail him?

190
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,823
Don't, Sonoko.

191
00:11:58,123 --> 00:11:59,722
Just joking, only joking.

192
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:02,223
But, this is so exciting.

193
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,922
I think I kind of got too nervous

194
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:08,022
that I have to go to the ladies' room.

195
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:10,523
Sorry, Ran, I'll be right back.

196
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:16,922
Geez.

197
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:18,923
Sonoko sure is late.

198
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:23,022
Yeah, she wasn't for it to begin with so...

199
00:12:23,023 --> 00:12:27,122
That's why we decided to meet and talk it out, right?

200
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:30,722
Yeah, but if Sonoko doesn't come...

201
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:34,522
If so, we wait outside until she succeeds

202
00:12:34,523 --> 00:12:36,422
and run for it together.

203
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:40,323
After all, today's the only chance we got to kill that guy.

204
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:49,723
What shall I do? I've got to get somebody, quick.

205
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:55,023
Cell phone, cell phone. Where's my cell phone?

206
00:12:57,423 --> 00:12:59,923
You heard us talking, didn't you?

207
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:04,023
"Akira Doi, Hideki Mamiya" -Hey, isn't that Sonoko's cell phone?

208
00:13:06,123 --> 00:13:08,922
No doubt about it. It's Sonoko's.

209
00:13:08,923 --> 00:13:11,222
How come you have it?

210
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:14,222
My friend picked it up so, I was going to return it...

211
00:13:14,223 --> 00:13:16,822
You mean Sonoko dropped it?

212
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:20,222
Which means maybe she didn't read our mail.

213
00:13:20,223 --> 00:13:23,923
Either way, we can't let you go, like this.

214
00:13:29,523 --> 00:13:31,322
What the heck? So, you finally made it?

215
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:34,122
What should we do with this girl?

216
00:13:34,123 --> 00:13:35,522
Just like Akira says,

217
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,722
we can't let her go as is.

218
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:39,822
Let's take her to the factory for now.

219
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:41,723
Yeah, I guess so.

220
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:52,331
What? Ran... Ran is gone?

221
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:56,331
Right, she disappeared while I was in the lady's room.

222
00:13:56,332 --> 00:13:59,131
Are you sure she's not back at the hotel room sleeping?

223
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:01,331
I called and asked,

224
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:03,631
but was told she hasn't come back yet.

225
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:05,631
I wonder what happened.

226
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:07,631
That's cause for worry.

227
00:14:07,632 --> 00:14:10,631
Hey, did you try calling her cell phone? Ran's cell phone?

228
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:14,231
Yes, but no one answered.

229
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:16,331
I wonder if she has it on manner mode

230
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:19,231
and doesn't know it's ringing. Or, it could be that...

231
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:20,631
Or, it could be that...

232
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:23,032
she's in a situation that she can't answer.

233
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:28,632
But, I can't tell if it's an accident or an incident.

234
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:39,932
Where is this?

235
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:44,332
Why am I here?

236
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:49,631
You heard us talking, didn't you?

237
00:14:49,632 --> 00:14:52,431
Hey, isn't that Sonoko's cell phone?

238
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:55,031
No doubt about it. It's Sonoko's.

239
00:14:55,032 --> 00:14:57,031
How come you have it?

240
00:14:57,032 --> 00:15:00,632
You mean Sonoko dropped it?

241
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:03,432
Maybe I...

242
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:08,131
Don't tell she was kidnapped?

243
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:09,331
It can't be?

244
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:11,731
Hey, you guys.

245
00:15:11,732 --> 00:15:14,331
What's with that bummed out look on your faces?

246
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:16,731
I get it, you guys lost?

247
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:19,231
No, it's not that.

248
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:20,731
Ran...

249
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:23,331
May have been kidnapped.

250
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:25,432
What?

251
00:15:30,832 --> 00:15:32,631
There.

252
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,331
Hey, hold it.

253
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:36,931
Are you sure about this kidnap thing?

254
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:40,431
Maybe she's lost somewhere near here?

255
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:43,331
But, she's not answering her cell phone.

256
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:45,031
She's not back at the hotel either.

257
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:47,832
But that's not enough to go on...

258
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:53,431
It's from Ran.

259
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:56,932
See, how dare you worry me like that.

260
00:15:57,932 --> 00:16:01,031
Hello. Ran, just where the heck are you now?

261
00:16:01,032 --> 00:16:02,731
Sorry, Sonoko.

262
00:16:02,732 --> 00:16:05,431
It's seems as if I've been kidnapped.

263
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,131
You've been kidnapped after all?

264
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,032
-What? -Lend it to me.

265
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:12,431
Hello, Ran.

266
00:16:12,432 --> 00:16:13,631
Conan.

267
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:15,331
Do you know where you are?

268
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:16,831
Where?

269
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:21,031
It seems to be the locker room of an abandoned factory or something.

270
00:16:21,032 --> 00:16:23,431
Can you look out the window?

271
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:26,331
Is there anythin that can serve as a hint to where you are?

272
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:27,831
Anything will do.

273
00:16:27,832 --> 00:16:29,632
Okay, hold on.

274
00:16:34,432 --> 00:16:36,231
How about it, Ran?

275
00:16:36,232 --> 00:16:37,532
Sunflower.

276
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:41,031
Right, there are a lot of sunflowers in bloom here.

277
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:42,131
Anything else?

278
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:43,531
On the other side of the sunflowers

279
00:16:43,532 --> 00:16:45,731
there is a building that is not in use.

280
00:16:45,732 --> 00:16:47,131
There is a sign.

281
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,631
What's written on the sign?

282
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:51,232
Wait...

283
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:56,831
Hirukomachi.

284
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:59,131
Hirukomachi is what's written.

285
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:01,731
It's written with "bloodsucker" and "child" characters.

286
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:04,231
Okay. Hirukomachi, right?

287
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,831
And about the kidnappers?

288
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:10,831
The kidnappers are the ones who sent the mail to Sonoko.

289
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:13,832
The ones who mailed Sonoko?

290
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:17,131
Conan, please listen to me.

291
00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:21,331
Those people were saying that they're going to kill somebody today...

292
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,231
Hey, Ran. It's me.

293
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:24,531
Can you hear me?

294
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:27,932
Hey! Answer me, Ran!

295
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:33,231
The line's been cut.

296
00:17:33,232 --> 00:17:35,632
Maybe the kidnappers found her talking on the phone?

297
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:40,731
What shall we do?

298
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:43,431
She could've contacted the police.

299
00:17:43,432 --> 00:17:45,631
Maybe we should drop the whole idea after all.

300
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,431
No, we won't let anybody get in our way.

301
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:49,932
Not anybody.

302
00:18:05,932 --> 00:18:07,831
Thank you for waiting.

303
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:11,531
I am Officer Tamana from the Kumamoto Prefectural Police Department.

304
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:13,431
This is Officer Kato.

305
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:14,532
Hello.

306
00:18:15,732 --> 00:18:19,731
How do you do? I'm Kogoro Mouri.

307
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,931
Oh, I've heard a lot about you.

308
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:23,531
Well, please sit down.

309
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:24,532
Thank you.

310
00:18:27,632 --> 00:18:29,831
I'm sure you're very worried,

311
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:31,131
because I was contacted by Inspector Megure

312
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:34,131
telling me to handle the situation with great care.

313
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:37,631
Please do let us handle this case completely.

314
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:39,031
Yes, but...

315
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:40,631
Mr. Mouri,

316
00:18:40,632 --> 00:18:42,831
I understand how you feel,

317
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:45,031
but I don't think that you are in a situation

318
00:18:45,032 --> 00:18:47,031
to judge things objectively right now.

319
00:18:47,032 --> 00:18:50,131
This case involves the life of your daughter,

320
00:18:50,132 --> 00:18:52,431
so please bear with us for now and let us handle this.

321
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,331
All right.

322
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:55,931
I appreciate it.

323
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:59,231
Now, as to the current situation...

324
00:18:59,232 --> 00:19:00,832
Yes, sir.

325
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,631
As a result of our inquiries within this athletic park,

326
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:12,731
the said woman victim seems to have been carried away by two men.

327
00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:14,031
That's it.

328
00:19:14,032 --> 00:19:20,231
About the Hirukomachi that the victim had mentioned over the phone,

329
00:19:20,232 --> 00:19:22,931
such a town does not exist.

330
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:25,531
-What? -Are you serious?

331
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,432
What the heck is going on?

332
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:34,331
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri.

333
00:19:34,332 --> 00:19:38,831
If I didn't pick up that cell phone...

334
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:42,031
Don't worry about it, you're not to blame.

335
00:19:42,032 --> 00:19:44,332
The kidnappers are the villains.

336
00:19:47,432 --> 00:19:50,231
This is no time to be playing tennis, is it?

337
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,232
Sure isn't.

338
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,531
We've got to give up the tennis match.

339
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:57,732
Yeah. I am worried about Ran.

340
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,332
I don't think so.

341
00:20:02,332 --> 00:20:04,231
Like Ran was saying,

342
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:07,131
the whole point is to participate in the game.

343
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:11,131
She was for us through and through.

344
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:14,831
We can't give up the game now.

345
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:18,131
Of course I'm worried about Ran too.

346
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:22,031
But, there's nothing we can do by staying here either.

347
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:26,331
I think it's way better to show Ran our victory trophy

348
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:29,331
when she comes back and make her happy.

349
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:30,531
Yeah, but...

350
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:31,732
He's right.

351
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,431
Just like Mitsuhiko says,

352
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:37,331
we can't do anything here anyway.

353
00:20:37,332 --> 00:20:38,831
Let's participate in the game.

354
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:40,231
Right, Pops?

355
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:42,531
Huh? Yeah, right.

356
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,831
The police is working on the case

357
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:47,231
and you guys made it to the finals, right?

358
00:20:47,232 --> 00:20:48,831
If so, go for it.

359
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,632
Okay, we'll do our best.

360
00:20:51,732 --> 00:20:54,631
We've already come this far. Then, let's give it our best shot.

361
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:57,431
-Okay. -Okay, then let's all do our best

362
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:59,031
and show Ran the champion trophy.

363
00:20:59,032 --> 00:21:00,632
-Aye! -Aye...

364
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:03,431
Hey, Shinichi.

365
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:06,731
I'll bet you have no intention of participating in the game, do you?

366
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:10,231
You're planning to go search for her alone, aren't you?

367
00:21:10,232 --> 00:21:15,231
Yeah, although I feel bad for those kids.

368
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,032
You're really something.

369
00:21:21,332 --> 00:21:23,331
If you will excuse me...

370
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:26,231
Hello, this is Tamana.

371
00:21:26,232 --> 00:21:27,431
What?

372
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:29,131
And?

373
00:21:29,132 --> 00:21:30,132
Yeah.

374
00:21:31,132 --> 00:21:32,232
Yeah.

375
00:21:33,332 --> 00:21:35,332
Okay, do that, will you?

376
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:39,731
What's up? Don't tell me something happened to Ran...

377
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,531
No, the kidnappers seem to have called the station directly

378
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:45,831
demanding ransom, just now.

379
00:21:45,832 --> 00:21:46,832
What?

380
00:21:48,232 --> 00:21:51,631
An officer is on his way here

381
00:21:51,632 --> 00:21:53,231
with the recording of the phone conversation.

382
00:21:53,232 --> 00:21:56,031
Darn those guys, how dare they do this to Ran?

383
00:21:56,032 --> 00:21:57,632
They're not going to get away with this!

384
00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:01,231
What the heck's going on?

385
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:04,931
Why would they call the police directly for ransom?

386
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:08,731
Maybe this is no usual kidnapping.

387
00:22:08,732 --> 00:22:11,532
If so, what are they actually after?

388
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:15,732
The last words of Ran's call was...

389
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:20,731
They were saying that they're going to kill somebody today...

390
00:22:20,732 --> 00:22:23,232
They're going to kill somebody today?

391
00:22:24,832 --> 00:22:27,232
Maybe Ran?

392
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:01,731
"Next Episode" -Fifty million yen is totally impossible.

393
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,131
Mr. Mouri.

394
00:24:03,132 --> 00:24:05,531
You don't seem to like the idea.

395
00:24:05,532 --> 00:24:06,731
Ai.

396
00:24:06,732 --> 00:24:10,331
You're thinking that it's not just a plain kidnapping case, right?

397
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:11,531
Right.

398
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:15,131
Bad news. Conan is nowhere in sight.

399
00:24:15,132 --> 00:24:17,931
-What? -Come to think of it, neither is Ai.

400
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:19,231
Ai too?

401
00:24:19,232 --> 00:24:22,232
Maybe they both went to look for Ran.

402
00:24:23,732 --> 00:24:25,131
Next Conan,

403
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:29,332
"Smash of Love and Resolve (Part 2)"
