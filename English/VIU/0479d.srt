1
00:00:03,641 --> 00:00:04,741
"Blue, White and Black. Each person's reasoning" -Well, the thing

2
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:06,741
"Blue, White and Black. Each person's reasoning" -that bugs me most is...

3
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:11,041
that the killer deliberately made Tokitsu sit on the desk.

4
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:12,841
This position.

5
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:15,141
Is there any meaning to it?

6
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:17,141
One of the reasons may be that

7
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:20,441
the killer simply wanted the locked room murder to be visible from outside.

8
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:22,641
However...

9
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:26,241
And I wonder about the lavender and toolbox.

10
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:29,141
There seems to be both of them everyone else's room too.

11
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,941
No use staring from outside.

12
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:36,641
-I'm opening it. -Wait.

13
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:39,941
-Let me. -Go ahead!

14
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,541
Wires, nails, a wrench, a screw driver,

15
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,041
a drill, a steel ruler, a plier,

16
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,741
glue for wood products,

17
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:53,841
a saw, a utility knife.

18
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:56,241
Just as I thought, there's no hammer inside.

19
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:59,241
It seems that the murder weapon was taken out of here

20
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:00,841
After all, with a hammer like that,

21
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:03,341
a man, a woman

22
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:06,141
or even an elderly person could commit the murder.

23
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:08,241
Time wise that's true.

24
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:11,441
The time that those three disappeared from our sight

25
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:15,341
was from 19:26 and 32 seconds

26
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,841
to 19:39 and 15 seconds, to go to the restroom.

27
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:20,241
Mr. Tsuchio, who went to his room to get his cigarettes

28
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:25,241
was gone from 20:06 and 47 seconds to 21:28 and 21 seconds.

29
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:28,441
And finally Mr. Koya, who came to check on Mr. Tokitsu came to this room

30
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:33,441
and was gone from 21:30 and 6 seconds to 21:38 and 52 seconds.

31
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:36,941
Any of the three had enough time to commit the murder.

32
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:38,641
He even had the seconds recorded.

33
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:42,641
But, Mr. Koya seems to have been in the kitchen most of the time.

34
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:44,041
So, he would've been able to hide and move around freely

35
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,141
without having to worry about us watching him.

36
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:48,041
Well, but the kitchen windows

37
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,141
are all ones that cannot be opened or closed,

38
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:53,441
and are only there to let the light in.

39
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:55,441
As for the kitchen door it's here,

40
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:56,941
that is, in order to go out,

41
00:01:56,941 --> 00:02:00,041
he'll have to pass the dining room, where we are,

42
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,841
so I'm sure Mr. Koya was in the kitchen all the while.

43
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:04,741
By the way, this is the blueprint of the second floor

44
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:08,341
and all the four rooms are very similar except for a light difference

45
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:10,041
in the direction the windows are facing.

46
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,341
You sure work fast.

47
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:17,241
I've been here a half day earlier than you all, you see.

48
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:18,941
Come to think of it,

49
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:21,341
why is there electricity here?

50
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,841
Right...

51
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:24,441
it's an uninhabited island and yet.

52
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:27,741
A simple generator seems to be in the shed.

53
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:29,941
Would you like to go take a look?

54
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,141
We could go check out the wireless radio

55
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:33,441
that's supposed to be there while we're at it too.

56
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,141
True.

57
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:48,641
Talk about destroyed...

58
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:54,141
So this is the generator,

59
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,341
wasn't there a lock to this place?

60
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:59,341
There should've been a padlock.

61
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:02,441
I'm sure that Mr. Koya had the lock.

62
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:09,441
The padlock's

63
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:11,741
been forced opened!

64
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:14,541
Talk about a lot of muddy shoe prints...

65
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,141
It's Mr. Tsuchio's,

66
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:19,641
since he's the only one who came outside after it started raining.

67
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:22,741
Isn't that right, Hakuba?

68
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:24,441
Huh? He's gone.

69
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:27,441
What's with him? He disappeared.

70
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,441
It's gone.

71
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,141
It's not here.

72
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:36,241
The wire from the toolbox in this person's room is gone after all.

73
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,841
Isn't Hakuba back?

74
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:43,841
No, wasn't he together with you?

75
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:47,841
By the way, did you find anything after checking the shed?

76
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:49,541
Well, sort of.

77
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,641
No way.

78
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,441
The man's drunk.

79
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:58,541
You guys all claim that you're detectives

80
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,841
but you're all no more than green horns

81
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,341
that look capable on the outside.

82
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:09,741
Then, let's have them listen

83
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:12,441
to the deduction of the green-horn, shall we?

84
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:16,941
I see.

85
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:19,241
So, that's the story.

86
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,141
No doubt about it,

87
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:24,241
the culprit is...

88
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:25,441
that person.

89
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:27,541
That man.

90
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,541
Right?

91
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,541
He killed Tokitsu and prepared the locked room.

92
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,941
Mr. Renzo Koya.

93
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:45,841
Well, it's really simple with a little bit of thinking.

94
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:48,041
Tokitsu said it would take about an hour

95
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,941
to rig his room into a locked room.

96
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:54,841
In other words, it was a trick that was that intricate.

97
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:56,641
You naturally went to check him out

98
00:04:56,641 --> 00:05:00,341
just about when the room would be ready and killed him.

99
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,841
It could be carried out very naturally if you used his room

100
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:05,841
that was prepared for the locked room murder.

101
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:08,441
So, it wouldn't have been possible for Koshimizu who went to the restroom

102
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,941
right after Tokitsu said so and left.

103
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:14,641
Nor for Mr. Tsuchio who left 30 minutes later

104
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:16,641
to his room to get his cigarette

105
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:18,041
to commit the murder.

106
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:21,241
In other words, you, Mr. Renzo Koya, who went to see him alone

107
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:24,141
just before he was found killed in the locked room

108
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,741
is the only one

109
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:28,341
who could've killed him.

110
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:31,041
Oh, boy...

111
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:34,441
How much do you have to disappoint me before you stop?

112
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,941
I'm sorry to say that he's not the one.

113
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:39,741
Because the one who committed the crime

114
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:43,641
is one who can unlock and lock doors and windows just by using a wire.

115
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:46,641
That person is Mr. Tsuchio.

116
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:48,341
It's you.

117
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:50,341
Don't be ridiculous!

118
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:53,041
The padlock that was on the shed that you headed for

119
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:56,241
after lying that you were going to go get your cigarette.

120
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:59,141
New traces of it having been forced opened were seen,

121
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:02,041
moreover, it found wet and thrown into the shed.

122
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,441
In other words, the one who forced the door open was Mr. Tsuchio,

123
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:07,641
the only one who went outside after it began raining.

124
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:09,941
On top of that, only the wire was found missing

125
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:12,741
from the toolbox in your room.

126
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:15,041
How did he make the locked room, though?

127
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,741
Mr. Tsuchio mentioned that

128
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:19,541
he came here three days ago to check the place out beforehand.

129
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,241
At that time he probably,

130
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:24,741
opened a small hole in the window of that room.

131
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:27,441
Then, after killing Mr. Tokitsu tonight,

132
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:29,041
he went outside from the window,

133
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,741
and from the hole in the glass he made previously,

134
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:33,741
used the wire to lock the window,

135
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,541
He probably figured beforehand that Hattori

136
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,241
would break through the window glass later

137
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:42,641
and make a grand entrance into the room,

138
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:47,141
making it impossible to find the hole made in the glass.

139
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:50,341
He then went to destroy the wireless radio in the shed,

140
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:53,641
to breed anxiety in us and corner us mentally.

141
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:56,441
He was ready to kill another one of us after that!

142
00:06:56,441 --> 00:06:57,841
Isn't that right?

143
00:06:57,841 --> 00:06:59,141
No way!

144
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:01,041
I don't think so.

145
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:06,341
Even if he were able to predict that

146
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:08,841
Heiji would break through the glass window,

147
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:10,841
he wouldn't have been able to tell

148
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:12,741
which of the four windows he would break through!

149
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:16,141
Besides, although Heiji is hot tempered,

150
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:18,441
I'm sure he would've noticed if there was a hole.

151
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:20,741
Never mind the hot tempered.

152
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,241
But the one who forced opened the padlock of the shed

153
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,841
is unmistakably him.

154
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:28,341
Yeah, it's true that this man has a bad habit,

155
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,541
but that's about it.

156
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:33,341
Or, is it that you have an equation in your head

157
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:36,741
that says, "A thief is the killer?"

158
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:40,441
I guess I goofed.

159
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:43,441
So, what with the locked room, trick?

160
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:46,041
Yep, it's a super simple trick!

161
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:49,041
First, you remove all the screws holding the window frames in place.

162
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,741
Then, you remove the windows.

163
00:07:50,741 --> 00:07:54,741
Finally, cut all the screws short using pliers and all set!

164
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,741
Then you insert the head of the screw that had been cut off

165
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:57,941
back into the window frame,

166
00:07:57,941 --> 00:08:00,341
and put glue on the area around the window frame.

167
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:03,841
Then, you go outside and fix the entire window in place.

168
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:06,641
In other words, it looks like the window is fixed on with screws,

169
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:08,641
but the inside is not.

170
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:13,141
The window was just glued on.

171
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:15,841
-And, the one who could've done that is... -Hold it.

172
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:19,241
Right, the very last person who went to Mr. Tokitsu's room...

173
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:20,341
Mr. Koya.

174
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:22,741
No one other than you could've done it!

175
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:25,541
What're you talking about, Heiji? He's...

176
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,541
You caught Tokitsu who was taking

177
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,941
his good old time absorbed in the trick off guard,

178
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:32,341
hit him and killed him.

179
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:35,241
No, I hate to interrupt you but...

180
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:36,841
Mr. Koya couldn't have carried the trick out.

181
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:38,741
I've got proof too.

182
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:42,741
This screw with the head cut off that I found in Tokitsu's room!

183
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:44,641
This guy...

184
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:46,341
Don't tell me that...

185
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:56,981
"Green. Message from Heiji" -Well?

186
00:08:56,981 --> 00:08:58,181
"Green. Message from Heiji" -This is what you call

187
00:08:58,181 --> 00:08:59,881
"Green. Message from Heiji" -conclusive evidence!

188
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:04,181
I guess you couldn't retrieve all of them.

189
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,881
Right!

190
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:12,181
You never know where the screw would fly off to

191
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:14,281
if you cut them with pliers.

192
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:19,481
Just as I thought.

193
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:21,781
So, it was you

194
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:24,181
who killed Tokitsu after all.

195
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:31,281
Hattori.

196
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:34,781
Tokitsu said that it would take him an hour to prepare the trick,

197
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:37,081
because he included the time for the glue to dry.

198
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:39,981
No matter how quickly he removed the screws and cut them,

199
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:45,081
even for instant glue to dry, it would take over 30 minutes.

200
00:09:45,081 --> 00:09:47,181
In other words, Tokitsu had planned to finish

201
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:49,381
what he had to in less than 30 minutes

202
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,081
and wait outside for the glue to dry.

203
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:56,381
So, the person who could kill Tokitsu who was still in his room

204
00:09:56,381 --> 00:09:58,281
is the one who got up right after dinner started.

205
00:09:58,281 --> 00:10:00,781
You're the only one who could've done it!

206
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:03,181
You probably faked going to the restroom

207
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:04,881
and headed for Tokitsu's room.

208
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:06,481
You probably told him that you also figured out the trick

209
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,981
so you wanted to compare answers and went inside.

210
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:13,081
You caught him off guard and killed him.

211
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:15,281
Then, you completed the trick that he was working on

212
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,281
and created the locked room.

213
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:18,781
You then entered from the front door

214
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:21,081
and came back to the dining room where we were,

215
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:23,681
as if nothing happened. That's it!

216
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:28,081
But, this is based on the assumption that you could've done it.

217
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:29,781
There's no proof.

218
00:10:29,781 --> 00:10:34,481
That's why I used the screw of the wireless radio that was in the shed.

219
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:35,781
Even if you know that you picked all the screws up,

220
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:41,181
me showing you this would make you anxious, right?

221
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:44,681
Moreover, Mr. Koya is suspected, and once you think it's not yourself,

222
00:10:44,681 --> 00:10:46,681
you inevitably go off guard.

223
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:48,781
I figured you would look towards the place you hid the screws,

224
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,981
so I kept watching you,

225
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:54,481
but I didn't think you keep them on you, in your pocket.

226
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:56,981
It surprised me...

227
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:01,081
seeing you counting them.

228
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:05,981
Well, you pretended to be afraid of the thunder and picked one up,

229
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:09,281
so I figured you had one on you.

230
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:11,881
You knew we were checking the shed.

231
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,481
You weren't afraid of thunder,

232
00:11:13,481 --> 00:11:16,681
but rather, it's proof that you were watching outside.

233
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:19,281
You bent down then to pick up the screw

234
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:22,481
that you failed to pick up previously, right?

235
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:26,981
Am I wrong?

236
00:11:26,981 --> 00:11:29,381
Oh, that's probably...

237
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:34,681
To hide the hole for your pierced ear.

238
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:36,781
You covered your ears to hide it, right?

239
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:38,381
Huh, pierce...

240
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:39,781
But...

241
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:42,381
That's why you were wearing a headphone on the ship, right?

242
00:11:42,381 --> 00:11:43,781
Because if your hair blew in the sea breeze,

243
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:45,381
it would reveal your pierced ears.

244
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:49,181
Well, there are a lot of students with pierced ears in England,

245
00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:51,081
so I didn't even bother to notice.

246
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:53,581
But, I thought your high school was really strict

247
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:56,481
that you could never be allowed pierced ears.

248
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:58,681
Yes, but it's okay already.

249
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:00,281
I'm already 20,

250
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:03,081
and I've graduated high school two years ago.

251
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:07,081
I took my old uniform out to hide what I could,

252
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:08,781
but goofed.

253
00:12:08,781 --> 00:12:10,681
I even went as far as to talk about school rules

254
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:13,181
so that I would look like a high school girl.

255
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:16,781
But, why did you gather us high school detectives

256
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:18,981
and do something like this?

257
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:24,281
I wanted to find out about something.

258
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,881
And, what's that?

259
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:29,581
The homicide at Lavender Manor.

260
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:32,081
You wanted to know who the high school detective that solved it was, right?

261
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:33,381
Yes.

262
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:37,881
Then, you mean it was... Tokitsu?

263
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:42,381
Although the name and details of the case wasn't written in the papers.

264
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:45,681
Yes, he happened to drop by at the mansion

265
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,781
while traveling through Shikoku,

266
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:52,081
solved the locked room case and left without saying his name.

267
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:53,181
Because of him,

268
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:57,081
my best friend who was working as a housekeeper there was suspected.

269
00:12:57,081 --> 00:12:58,181
She was suspected on the grounds

270
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:02,481
that she was with the lady of the house, just two of them together.

271
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:07,081
I also went to that mansion as a detective,

272
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:09,981
a month before that man appeared.

273
00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:12,981
My best friend asked me to investigate the case

274
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:15,281
because it could be a homicide.

275
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:25,481
But, I couldn't come up with anything.

276
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:27,981
I couldn't think of anything other than the fact that

277
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:31,781
she had locked herself in her room and committed suicide.

278
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:36,181
Then, why was your best friend suspected?

279
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:39,781
The high school detective that came two months later

280
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:42,681
found outside the window of her room

281
00:13:42,681 --> 00:13:44,981
scattered screws with heads cut off

282
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:50,681
as well as the fact that the window was only pasted on with glue.

283
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:52,981
You mean you overlooked it?

284
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:54,781
Overlooked it my foot.

285
00:13:54,781 --> 00:13:56,381
The man called Tsuchio

286
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:58,581
disguised himself as a cleaning staff

287
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:00,881
and set up the trick.

288
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,481
He probably rigged the window so that it would come off easily,

289
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:07,981
when he planned to come back to rob the house later.

290
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:11,181
That's why when you heard of the Lavender Manor,

291
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:15,181
you went pale and wanted to escape from the island.

292
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:17,281
Six months after the incident,

293
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:19,581
Tokitsu jumps onto the trick,

294
00:14:19,581 --> 00:14:21,681
as if to boast his power of deduction,

295
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:25,281
reports to the police and the media that this is a homicide.

296
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,581
"New Truth Disclosed on Suicide of the Lady of Lavender Manor"

297
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:28,081
"Police Conclude it to be Locked Room Homicide!"

298
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:29,481
"Suspect Still Denies Charges"

299
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:32,381
If the rust of the screws were checked,

300
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:33,581
it would've been obvious whether it had anything

301
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,581
to do with the case or not.

302
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:38,281
Tokitsu, realized that something was not right,

303
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:40,681
so he didn't disclose his name.

304
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:44,981
That's why I couldn't tell which high school detective it was.

305
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:46,681
The only clue I had

306
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:50,681
was the message that my best friend left me before she died.

307
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,881
A high school detective that speaks with a strange accent

308
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:54,581
suspects me.

309
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:57,281
Help me. Help me, Natsuki!

310
00:14:57,281 --> 00:14:59,281
That's all she left behind.

311
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:09,381
I see.

312
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:11,381
"A strange accent"

313
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:13,681
Since I've been living abroad for a while,

314
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:16,181
sometimes my Japanese is funny.

315
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,381
Hattori speaks with a super Kansai accent,

316
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:20,581
and Tokitsu talks in old Japanese.

317
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:22,881
That's why you gathered us all here.

318
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,581
Yes, moreover,

319
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:29,481
only you three had strong connections with the police too.

320
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:33,881
Which means that Kudo wasn't included to begin with?

321
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:34,981
Okay.

322
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:38,381
Yes, I just used his name to call Hakuba over

323
00:15:38,381 --> 00:15:40,881
because Kudo is famous.

324
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:43,981
And, at this lodge where you gathered all the detectives,

325
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:46,581
you first put Mr. Tsuchio to sleep and tied him up,

326
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:50,581
created a locked room just like the one at Lavender Manor

327
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:53,381
and got hold of the target you were after.

328
00:15:53,381 --> 00:15:57,381
Yes, if I put the necessary tools in the room

329
00:15:57,481 --> 00:16:00,181
filled with the fragrance of lavender,

330
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:04,081
the high school detective would recall the case immediately

331
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:06,581
and see through the trick.

332
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:11,781
That mansion was really virtually buried in lavender.

333
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:13,081
Isn't that right,

334
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:16,481
Mr. Renzo Koya who used to work as the steward of that mansion?

335
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:25,881
Yes, because the lady of the house loved them very much.

336
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:31,181
Miss!

337
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:36,981
Then, why did you call him here?

338
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:39,481
He knew why the lady of the house committed suicide

339
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:40,681
and yet he didn't say a word about it.

340
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:42,781
That's because...

341
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:45,081
Miss, please don't take anymore medicine!

342
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:48,981
Quiet, let me do as I please!

343
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:52,081
I couldn't say a word

344
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:55,081
to protect the honor of the lady of the house.

345
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,881
I thought that suspicion against her

346
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:59,181
would clear as investigations progressed.

347
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:00,181
"Suspect of Locked Room Murder Commits Suicide"

348
00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:03,081
I never imagined something like that would happen.

349
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:06,281
Please accept my apologies.

350
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:08,581
But... hold it.

351
00:17:08,581 --> 00:17:11,781
If you called these two here that you have a grudge against...

352
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,981
Right, nobody will come for you.

353
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:16,681
Back then, I told the captain of the ship that

354
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:18,081
if he can't keep a secret,

355
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:19,481
I'm not going to pay him the remainder,

356
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:21,881
to make sure he wouldn't talk.

357
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:24,581
I couldn't afford having him run away on me,

358
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:27,181
even if he were to realize what my plan was.

359
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:29,481
I had that in mind too.

360
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:33,381
As for Tokitsu, he kept explaining his mistaken deduction

361
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:37,781
of the murder at Lavender Manor up to the time he was killed by me.

362
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:39,981
He was really someone not worth bothering with.

363
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:42,581
So, you're the one who broke the wireless radio too.

364
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:44,881
Of course I'm the one who broke it.

365
00:17:44,881 --> 00:17:47,281
We all die together.

366
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:51,781
I'm sorry, sonny.

367
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:54,081
No need to apologize!

368
00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:57,881
They'll come to save us, I know!

369
00:17:59,481 --> 00:18:04,581
You said that you came here a half day earlier than us, right?

370
00:18:04,581 --> 00:18:07,281
Didn't you come here with your own cruiser?

371
00:18:07,281 --> 00:18:08,881
No, I just happened to arrive

372
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,881
earlier than scheduled at the harbor.

373
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:14,081
I heard that it was a lodge that was not in use for a while

374
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:16,981
and that I was going to be sleeping together with many people so...

375
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:20,681
I looked for a ship that recently shipped daily necessities and food

376
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:21,981
to an uninhabited island,

377
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:24,181
and had them bring me here,

378
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:26,381
after paying a hefty sum of money.

379
00:18:26,381 --> 00:18:30,381
Which means that nobody knows you're here?

380
00:18:30,481 --> 00:18:33,981
No, and how about you, haven't you told anybody?

381
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:36,281
Well, I sort of did, but...

382
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,481
She's kind of dense.

383
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:40,181
What?

384
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:44,181
A sound?

385
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:46,381
What's this sound?

386
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:50,281
Don't tell me that the generator also broke down.

387
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:52,681
It's not the sound of the generator!

388
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,581
Then, what's this sound?

389
00:18:57,581 --> 00:19:02,081
Heiji!

390
00:19:03,681 --> 00:19:05,281
It's Kazuha!

391
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:07,681
Kazuha brought a ship along!

392
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:08,881
Why?

393
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:13,581
Heiji left a message and landmark behind.

394
00:19:13,581 --> 00:19:18,481
Yeah, I leave a message saying "Heiji Hattori was here!"

395
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,981
Oh, there he is! It's Heiji and Conan too!

396
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:31,881
Really, it's Heiji!

397
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:34,781
God, if you spit it out right away,

398
00:19:34,781 --> 00:19:37,981
you wouldn't have had to take on five throws over the shoulder.

399
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:39,481
It was six.

400
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:40,981
What?

401
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:48,281
I'm glad there are hot-blooded detectives like you around.

402
00:19:48,281 --> 00:19:51,081
I smear the door knob with blood and you break the door down,

403
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:53,381
then you crack the glass window and break in.

404
00:19:53,381 --> 00:19:57,381
Thanks to you, the dead body ends up leaning against the window.

405
00:19:57,481 --> 00:19:59,981
If you charge forward body and all and the entire window falls off,

406
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,381
that's it.

407
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:04,581
Sorry, that I'm so hot tempered and rash.

408
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:08,181
Nope, to believe that a person is alive

409
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:10,581
till you confirm the person's death

410
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:13,581
is what a famed detective is all about.

411
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:15,281
Right, sonny?

412
00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:23,381
If god would allow me to...

413
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:27,381
I would really have liked to have a Detective Championship

414
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:29,481
with both of you.

415
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:36,281
If I could only go back to my high school days without worry.

416
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:06,081
And? Is Kudo there?

417
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:09,381
I'm not sure.

418
00:22:11,281 --> 00:22:13,881
Of course he's not.

419
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:21,081
Inoue... Hiroko Inoue's been murdered.

420
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:23,681
"I've finally found happiness..." she said,

421
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:26,381
and really sounded happy...

422
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:28,281
Could it have been a mere random robbery?

423
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:31,181
No, something bothers me.

424
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:33,881
Hey, you saw the culprit, didn't you?

425
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:35,981
Who was it?

426
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:39,781
Tell me, who the heck was it?

427
00:22:39,781 --> 00:22:45,481
Next Conan, "Yellow Alibi"

428
00:22:46,203 --> 00:22:48,003
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:50,403
Local newspaper.

430
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:52,703
-Haibara, where is your home town? -Doc's place.

431
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:54,603
-No way. -Indeed.

432
00:22:54,603 --> 00:22:55,603
Yeah.
