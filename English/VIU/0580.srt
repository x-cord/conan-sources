"Beika Department Store"

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:04,981
It's a phantom.

3
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:07,381
He can't possibly be alive.

4
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:12,681
Because I shot Shuichi Akai to death with my very hands.

5
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:24,481
Gin, right in front of your very eyes too, right?

6
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:26,181
It wasn't in front of my eyes.

7
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:27,981
I was looking through the monitor.

8
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:32,781
Back then, you could've rigged the entire scene.

9
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:35,381
Am I wrong, Kir?

10
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:39,181
Rigged the scene?

11
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:41,881
Just what could I have done?

12
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:45,481
After all, you're the one who told me

13
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:48,681
to summon Akai over to Raiha Pass in the first place.

14
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:53,381
No. Now, call him over here right now!

15
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:57,381
Well, I'm finding it hard to stay with the Organization,

16
00:00:57,381 --> 00:01:00,681
I want out, so can you help me make it out.

17
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:04,181
Of course, I'll provide you the information that the FBI wants.

18
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:07,181
Could I meet you from now, just the two of us?

19
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:10,081
Yes. As long as you're alone too,

20
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:12,181
I don't mind.

21
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:14,181
Will this do?

22
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:18,781
You're the one who told me to shoot him in the head too.

23
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:24,981
His head.

24
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:27,981
Shoot the bullet right through his head!

25
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:32,781
That way you can kill him off completely.

26
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:35,181
And you watched everything from the time he bled

27
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:38,981
from his head to when he fell to the ground

28
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:42,181
through the camera that you set on me.

29
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:46,681
After being rescued from the FBI,

30
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:49,481
I was constantly under the surveillance of the Organization,

31
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:53,081
I couldn't possibly have made any arrangement with him either.

32
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:55,781
Therefore, I couldn't possibly have done anything.

33
00:01:55,781 --> 00:02:01,181
Plus, if either he or I had a god-like brain

34
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:04,081
that could help us see through things in the future,

35
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:06,181
maybe we could've worked something out.

36
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:10,381
Yes, just like Sherlock Holmes.

37
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,081
Why don't you stop being so queerly suspicious

38
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:18,181
and just be happy that you arch rival disappeared?

39
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,581
Yes.

40
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:22,381
I'm so overjoyed I can't contain it.

41
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:25,381
Because if he ever happens to be alive,

42
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:28,081
I could kill him all over again.

43
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:31,481
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

44
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:33,681
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

45
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:35,081
The time limit closes in.

46
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:37,981
Figure out what the bomb man is really after.

47
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:39,781
He sees through the one and only truth.

48
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:41,681
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

49
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:43,681
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

50
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:27,345
A strange job offer came to the Mouri Detective Agency.

51
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:31,745
A person calls and asks Kogoro to talk to a person who is troubled

52
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:34,645
by red T-shirts that were being sent him every week.

53
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:38,545
We went to the Beika Department Store to meet this person

54
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,045
but the person waiting for us there

55
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:42,745
was a man with a bomb wrapped around his body.

56
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:47,545
The man says that he was threatened by a masked man

57
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:50,345
who told him to place bombs in each place on the floor.

58
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:53,145
We ended up being confined on this floor.

59
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:57,845
The masked man wants to find the person

60
00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:01,045
who kept sending the red T-shirts to him every week.

61
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:04,945
He says that the man should be on this floor.

62
00:05:04,945 --> 00:05:07,545
We checked the 13 T-shirts that were carried

63
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:10,645
by the man with the bomb wrapped around him

64
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,745
and found from the receipts

65
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:17,345
of the T-shirts that they were all bought

66
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:20,445
at the fitness section every Sunday at 12:28 pm.

67
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:24,545
What is the identity of the person sending the T-shirts?

68
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:27,045
What is his purpose?

69
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:30,445
And who is the person looking for the sender of the T-shirts

70
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:33,445
and turned into a bomb threat man?

71
00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:42,045
"Black Time Limit Closes In"

72
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:43,645
Vodka.

73
00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:46,345
Park the car on the opposite side of the department store!

74
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,945
In a position where the guy called Akai

75
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:52,545
can be seen in clear view.

76
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:54,245
What's the matter?

77
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:55,245
Hurry and move the car.

78
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:58,045
Well... You see...

79
00:05:58,045 --> 00:06:01,945
According to Korn who's on guard at the basement exit,

80
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:05,945
something seems to be going on in the department store.

81
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:09,745
Hey, Korn don't you have more information?

82
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:16,245
No, but, I saw a lot of riot police officers

83
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:19,245
and bomb disassembling officers go inside.

84
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,745
Riot police officers and bomb disassembling officers?

85
00:06:22,745 --> 00:06:25,245
What's going on?

86
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:27,745
What on earth?

87
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:29,745
"Beika Department Store"

88
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:47,045
Please wait!

89
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:50,545
The person who received red underwear every week,

90
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:53,945
wants us to find the sender among these people.

91
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:57,145
You do understand that the demand of the bomb man, don't you?

92
00:06:57,145 --> 00:06:58,545
Yes.

93
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:00,745
The receipts that were found together

94
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:02,545
with the T-shirts are those of this department store.

95
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:05,045
And the only section that sells wears on this floor

96
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:07,745
is the fitness goods section!

97
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:09,545
Moreover, the time that the wears are bought

98
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:13,545
are always the same as today, every Sunday at 12:28 pm!

99
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:17,445
And to top it off, you're the only salesclerk

100
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:20,945
that's on duty on Sunday at this time, am I right?

101
00:07:20,945 --> 00:07:22,545
Yes...

102
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:25,945
Then, why don't you remember that customer?

103
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,645
You'd think he'd leave an impression on you, wouldn't he?

104
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:30,245
Because he comes to buy the same thing

105
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:32,845
at the same hour and day each time!

106
00:07:32,845 --> 00:07:36,445
But, I really don't recall such a person.

107
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:39,745
Darn, no way.

108
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:45,345
That red underwear has not been sold yet today.

109
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:47,045
Then, at that time,

110
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:51,345
did you have someone take your place, or something?

111
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,045
Not for the past 6 months!

112
00:07:54,045 --> 00:07:57,845
Then, is this receipt from some years ago?

113
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:01,145
No, because we've been using

114
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:04,345
this type of receipt this year.

115
00:08:04,345 --> 00:08:09,045
All I do is get the items and payment from the customers

116
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:13,345
and give them to Ms. Seta at the cash register.

117
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:17,445
Then, I put the receipt and change in the bag together

118
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:20,245
with the purchased items and give them to the customer.

119
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:26,345
So if such a queer customer were to come by,

120
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:30,345
I'm sure I'd never forget.

121
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:31,845
But...

122
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,545
We have the receipts proving they were here.

123
00:08:35,545 --> 00:08:37,945
Excuse me...

124
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:40,245
The bomb man!

125
00:08:40,245 --> 00:08:41,845
Stay away from me!

126
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:45,945
Stop calling me bomb man, please!

127
00:08:45,945 --> 00:08:49,545
I'm not the bomb man but rather,

128
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:51,745
a sinless ordinary citizen who had a bomb

129
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:54,645
wrapped around my body.

130
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,145
That's why

131
00:08:57,145 --> 00:09:02,045
I'm telling you to stay away from me until this case is solved, aren't I?

132
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:03,845
Oh, yes.

133
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:06,745
But the boy with the glasses

134
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:11,445
is playing around with the red T-shirt.

135
00:09:11,445 --> 00:09:13,245
Playing around?

136
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:24,745
What're you doing?

137
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:27,445
Just like you did a while ago, Ran.

138
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:31,245
I just tried folding it according to the crease.

139
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:36,845
But, when they're lined out, they look kind of eerie, right?

140
00:09:36,845 --> 00:09:40,245
Remember? Like in the Holmes novel.

141
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:41,645
"The Adventure of the Dancing Men"?

142
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:44,545
Right, just like the code in that novel!

143
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:47,145
Then, this could be a code too?

144
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:50,045
If you read it from the right in the order they were sent

145
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:52,945
maybe there's a sentence?

146
00:09:52,945 --> 00:09:54,445
-Really, -It hurts...

147
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:57,345
the minute I take my eyes off of you!

148
00:09:57,345 --> 00:09:59,945
Dad.

149
00:09:59,945 --> 00:10:02,445
I told you to stay still, didn't I?

150
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:07,645
But, when Conan fold the shirts according to the crease...

151
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:09,545
He says it could be a code.

152
00:10:09,545 --> 00:10:12,245
A code?

153
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,045
It couldn't be.

154
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:17,745
We don't even know when the creases were made either!

155
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:24,545
What?

156
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:27,145
The sender of red underwear?

157
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:28,745
Yes, sir!

158
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:32,545
That seems to be the purpose of the bomb man.

159
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:35,645
And? How many bombs are there?

160
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:37,945
According to the image on the surveillance camera

161
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:41,545
there's one at each of the two elevators and two stairs.

162
00:10:41,545 --> 00:10:43,445
Adding the upward and downward escalators,

163
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:46,045
we're looking at six places at least.

164
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,045
Six places?

165
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:50,045
What a hassle.

166
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:51,345
Strange, right?

167
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:54,245
Although the floor was sealed because of a bomb threat,

168
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:56,845
the information's leaking out too fast.

169
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:58,845
True.

170
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:01,345
-Besides... -Can't be!

171
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:03,145
You're on the floor where the bomb is?

172
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,645
Hey... Can you make calls?

173
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:07,845
The bomb man is here, isn't he?

174
00:11:07,845 --> 00:11:11,445
The cell phones of the customers haven't been taken away.

175
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:14,445
Maybe the culprit's an amateur?

176
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:15,745
I sure hope so.

177
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:18,645
Idiot! You gotta be kidding!

178
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,245
I'm not kidding!

179
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:22,245
There, take a look for yourself!

180
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:25,345
TV telephone.

181
00:11:25,345 --> 00:11:30,245
You see the man with a bomb wrapped around his body, don't you?

182
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:32,145
No joke?

183
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:35,245
Shu!

184
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:41,245
Transform!

185
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:43,745
There!

186
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:51,245
Hey, what're you doing?

187
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,445
Well...

188
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:58,145
I tried moving according to the shape of the wear.

189
00:11:58,145 --> 00:12:00,145
But, I'm getting nowhere.

190
00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:01,845
Never mind doing something like that.

191
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:05,545
Will you just hurry and find the sender of the T-shirts!

192
00:12:05,545 --> 00:12:07,245
Right...

193
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:08,545
But...

194
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:11,045
Don't you think that Dad's movements

195
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:12,545
just now resembled something?

196
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:14,045
What?

197
00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:15,245
Right!

198
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:18,845
Maybe Conan would be able to figure out what it is.

199
00:12:18,845 --> 00:12:21,245
Gosh, he's gone again!

200
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:25,645
I see!

201
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:28,545
When you get the items from the customers,

202
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:32,345
you take it to the cashier beyond?

203
00:12:32,345 --> 00:12:33,845
Yes, it is.

204
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:36,645
After saying, "One moment, please!"

205
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:39,945
Thanks for telling me!

206
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:41,045
See you!

207
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:47,145
Excuse me!

208
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:49,945
Wait...

209
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:50,945
Son...

210
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:54,245
So, this is what the inside of the cash register room!

211
00:12:55,545 --> 00:12:57,145
Excuse me...

212
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:59,545
I'm going to borrow your computer a bit!

213
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,345
For what?

214
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:05,645
Pops told me to check something out!

215
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:11,645
On the accident on the snowy mountain on December 28th, right?

216
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:13,045
Yes.

217
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:22,045
Here it is! I'm sure this is it!

218
00:13:26,745 --> 00:13:29,645
It's an accident that happened 10 years ago.

219
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:31,645
A veteran mountain climber

220
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:34,445
seems to have gotten caught in an avalanche and died!

221
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:39,245
All right!

222
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:40,445
Is that it?

223
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,845
Yes!

224
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:45,845
I'll go tell Pops that it was just as he thought!

225
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:47,145
I see.

226
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:52,745
Thank you, Ms. Maruoka!

227
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,345
I've figured out what the sender is after.

228
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:04,745
Next, I've got to figure out the motive of the bomb man.

229
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:07,945
What is purpose for causing such a commotion?

230
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:12,445
All I can do is to wait and see what the bomb man's next step.

231
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:13,745
At any rate, I guess I'm not wrong to think

232
00:14:13,745 --> 00:14:17,045
that the bomb man is very confident.

233
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:21,145
He's confident that the crime he committed in the past

234
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:24,645
will never be disclosed.

235
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:30,245
Really, where were you?

236
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,045
To the restroom.

237
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:33,245
Gosh.

238
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:36,245
Right, it won't be revealed.

239
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:38,345
My crime is perfect.

240
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:41,745
There is no proof or eye-witnesses either.

241
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:44,345
You imbecile that's trying to threaten me!

242
00:14:44,345 --> 00:14:47,445
I'll make sure you won't be able to do something like this again.

243
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:52,245
And, did anything else come up?

244
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:55,045
No, not at all.

245
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:56,945
Thanks to you skittering here and there,

246
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:59,945
I can't organize anything in my head.

247
00:14:59,945 --> 00:15:03,745
Dad, you blaming it on Conan.

248
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:08,445
It's all because you used the money from the client on sushi.

249
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:11,545
Now, you're blaming it on Ran.

250
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:12,945
Shut up!

251
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,145
All I've gotta do is think, right! I'll think!

252
00:15:18,345 --> 00:15:21,045
Please excuse me.

253
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:26,445
Snow mountain, after all.

254
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:10,633
Why won't you let me in?

255
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:12,633
I can't tell you.

256
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:21,733
So, he's sealed the floor off with bombs.

257
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:25,933
Yes. It seems that some idiot is doing it.

258
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:29,433
It seems he demanding for someone to be found.

259
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:32,033
Since there is no sign of the guy who looks like Akai

260
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,733
coming out of the department store at all.

261
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:38,233
I take it that the guy is on that floor too.

262
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,633
We've got a problem, don't we?

263
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,433
Even if the bomb man is caught, or if the bomb goes off,

264
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:56,433
the exit would be crowded with chaos.

265
00:16:56,433 --> 00:17:00,033
I wonder if we'll be able to get the guy in the commotion.

266
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:03,033
No, it's even better for us.

267
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:06,633
The murderous intent of the sniper will be erased by the crowd,

268
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:09,833
and make it hard for him to flee even if he wanted to.

269
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:13,133
For Chianti who is waiting right above here

270
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:16,333
and Korn who is waiting at the basement exit,

271
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,833
he's an easy prey to hunt down.

272
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:22,133
Hey, does he know about this?

273
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:24,833
He? Just who are you referring to?

274
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,233
Bourbon.

275
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:29,633
I heard that he went out to look for the scientist Sherry,

276
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,633
who betrayed the Organization.

277
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,233
I wonder...

278
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:37,133
He's secretive just like Vermouth.

279
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:40,233
I have no idea where or what they're doing.

280
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:44,333
Come to think of it, Bourbon didn't like Akai either.

281
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,633
Even more than you do, Gin.

282
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,933
Well, as for his whereabouts I had no intention of telling

283
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:52,333
even if I knew where he is.

284
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,633
What? Why not?

285
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:59,033
He refused to believe that Akai was dead.

286
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:02,633
He can't help but think he's the only one

287
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:05,033
who could finish Akai.

288
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:12,033
If the guy in question is Akai, he would snicker.

289
00:18:12,033 --> 00:18:16,433
I'd rather not see his face again.

290
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,033
Hey, enough already!

291
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:29,233
Right!

292
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,133
How long is it going to take, anyway?

293
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:35,933
You're the famous detective Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

294
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:38,133
Hurry up and find sender of the red T-shirts

295
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:41,233
that the bomb man is looking for

296
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:44,133
and let us go home!

297
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:46,133
Oh, well...

298
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:48,833
I still have no idea who the sender of the T-shirts is,

299
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,233
or anything about who the bomb man is either.

300
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,433
Mail?

301
00:18:57,433 --> 00:19:00,233
I've never seen this address before.

302
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,433
What? Can't be...

303
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:11,533
No...

304
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:17,533
Wait, dad!

305
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,633
That's right near the bomb.

306
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,433
I'll be fine.

307
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:25,033
I won't let the bomb go off.

308
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:30,633
In the name of the great detective, Kogoro Mouri.

309
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:33,033
Then, don't tell me you've figured out

310
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:36,033
who the sender of the red T-shirts is?

311
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:39,633
But, you just said a while ago that you had no idea.

312
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:44,833
Yes, the invisible sender and invisible bomb man.

313
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,633
That's where the key to solving this case was!

314
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:56,633
What? There was movement on the confined floor?

315
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:59,133
Yes, it just so happened

316
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,733
that Detective Kogoro Mouri was on the floor.

317
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:05,233
What? The Sleeping Kogoro?

318
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:08,433
I hope he somehow stops the bomb from exploding.

319
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:12,533
I know it's a hassle but we're counting on you, Detective Mouri!

320
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,933
Don't you think it's strange?

321
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:20,433
If you look at the receipts that were sent along with the red underwear,

322
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:22,833
it's easy to tell that they were purchased

323
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:27,433
every Sunday at 12:28 pm.

324
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:30,333
If you want to figure out who the sender is,

325
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,033
just come to that floor where the item is sold

326
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:37,733
at the time indicated secretly and the sender will eventually appear.

327
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:40,833
I'm sure that the sender didn't show up.

328
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,533
That's why the culprit knocked that man out in the men's room

329
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:47,333
and wrapped the bomb, and told him to look for the sender.

330
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,133
That's what's weird.

331
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:50,633
What?

332
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:53,633
In order to wrap a bomb around someone's body,

333
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:56,233
you've got to be somewhere that nobody will see you.

334
00:20:56,233 --> 00:21:00,933
By doing so, you'll have to take your eyes off the fitness section.

335
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:04,933
Would I, who is desperately looking for the sender

336
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:09,033
even to the point of using bombs, do something like that?

337
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:12,933
True, but, if the bomb man had an accomplice

338
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:14,933
and that person was watching.

339
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:18,433
There's none! Take a good look around!

340
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:26,233
Everybody's using the cell phone all over the place, see?

341
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:30,233
If someone wanted to take control of the floor had an accomplice,

342
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:33,333
he would never let them do something like that.

343
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,533
Then...

344
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:37,233
Maybe he wrapped the bomb around

345
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:40,833
that man's body before 12:28 pm and got ready?

346
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:44,433
No, the bomb was actually more like a last resort thing.

347
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,733
As for the bombs on the floor,

348
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:50,133
it'll be okay if they're retrieved before exploding

349
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:53,333
but it's too risky to wrap a bomb around someone's body beforehand

350
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:57,833
under the circumstance that the sender may show up.

351
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:03,433
But, the bomb man is alone, isn't he?

352
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:06,533
How could he ever wrap the bomb around the man's body

353
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,333
while keeping an eye on the place where the item is sold?

354
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,833
He didn't wrap it here but rather,

355
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,833
came here with it wrapped around his body.

356
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,533
With it wrapped around... It can't be...

357
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:20,733
Don't tell me that...

358
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:23,133
Isn't that right?

359
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,633
Bomb man?

360
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:30,933
Mr. Ordinary Citizen?

361
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,333
Mail from somebody he doesn't know?

362
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:03,033
What's up? What's the rush?

363
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:07,033
Don't tell me you're looking for the same person I am?

364
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:09,233
No, Shu!

365
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:10,933
Don't go out.

366
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:13,033
They're coming after you!

367
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:15,333
Please stop!

368
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:18,333
Akai Shuichi.

369
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,833
