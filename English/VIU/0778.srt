1
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:27,980
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

2
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:30,280
And move forward full speed without slowing down!

3
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,680
The clue to an unseen case

4
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:33,480
is seen in a mysterious mirage.

5
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:35,180
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:37,080
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:39,581
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:23,783
"The Angel Disappears into the Mirage"

9
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:24,784
"Mouri Detective Agency"

10
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:26,183
I see.

11
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:30,683
So, you want me to look for your missing husband?

12
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:35,283
Yes. This is my husband, Satoru Aoki.

13
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:37,083
He's an artist,

14
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:38,283
and there were times in the past,

15
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:42,283
when he would go off painting without telling me where he was going.

16
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:44,883
But he never failed to report back

17
00:02:44,884 --> 00:02:48,183
on how much progress his was making.

18
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:51,583
He would send me photos of the canvas every day.

19
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:54,983
I see. And that stopped the day before yesterday.

20
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:58,683
Yes. This is the last photo I received.

21
00:02:58,684 --> 00:02:59,983
How beautiful.

22
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:02,983
But there's something strange about the photo.

23
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:04,483
Which means?

24
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,483
He's an artist that draws only

25
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:09,083
what he actually sees with his own eyes.

26
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:13,483
But that painting doesn't look to be anything of this world, does it?

27
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:17,084
True. Maybe he changed his painting style.

28
00:03:17,984 --> 00:03:21,384
I got it! I know where Mr. Aoki is!

29
00:03:22,884 --> 00:03:25,183
What a beautiful ocean!

30
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:28,383
Are you sure it's here?

31
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:32,283
Yep. The bluish white waves that were in that painting

32
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:33,983
is a natural phenomenon called "Glowing Firefly Squid"

33
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:35,883
or "Suicide of the Firefly Squid".

34
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:38,383
The phenomenon of the school of bluish white firefly squid

35
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:43,383
being washed up to shore is exclusive only to Toyama Bay.

36
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:47,683
And recently, it was sighted at this beach!

37
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:50,583
You're very knowledgeable, aren't you?

38
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:52,783
I... I saw it on TV.

39
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:53,883
Oh boy.

40
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:56,483
But, how do we look for him from here?

41
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:59,784
Let's go search every lodging nearby.

42
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,684
Dear!

43
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:20,283
The victim is artist Mr. Satoru Aoki, age 52.

44
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:24,483
I see. His identity was specified quite speedily, no?

45
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:26,683
Yes. Well, you see...

46
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:29,583
His wife just happened to be here looking for him,

47
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:31,483
together with a detective.

48
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:34,483
Hello, I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri.

49
00:04:34,484 --> 00:04:36,583
Mouri?

50
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:38,383
You mean the Sleeping Kogoro?

51
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:40,283
Did he drown to death?

52
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:41,883
Yes, most probably.

53
00:04:41,884 --> 00:04:47,083
His estimate tine of death is between 20:00 to 23:00 yesterday.

54
00:04:47,084 --> 00:04:50,583
The sea was rough last night, wasn't it?

55
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:51,683
Yes, sir.

56
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:54,283
And moreover, this was found in the pocket of the corpse.

57
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:56,583
You mean he was drunk?

58
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:58,183
According to Mrs. Aoki,

59
00:04:58,184 --> 00:05:00,283
it seems that Mr. Aoki had a bad leg

60
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:03,483
and was dragged it along when walking.

61
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:06,883
He was probably drunk, slipped and fell into the sea.

62
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:09,383
-No. -Huh?

63
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:13,083
He has what looks like a bruise on his cheek.

64
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:14,084
See.

65
00:05:14,085 --> 00:05:16,483
Did he bruise himself when he fell into the sea?

66
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:20,283
Well, there's a possibility that he was punched by someone.

67
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:23,684
-Yes. -Not you again. Stay put!

68
00:05:29,884 --> 00:05:31,983
Who is that?

69
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:35,383
A local fisherman called Ishiguro.

70
00:05:35,384 --> 00:05:38,584
He's a hard worker, but prone to violence.

71
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:42,083
Hello.

72
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:44,784
I'm from the police. I contacted you earlier.

73
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:49,883
Yes. It's true that Mr. Aoki from about 2 weeks ago

74
00:05:49,884 --> 00:05:52,283
was staying over here.

75
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:54,984
But I had no idea that he had passed away.

76
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:59,083
If you will excuse me then.

77
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:00,184
Thank you.

78
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:04,084
Huh? The painting's gone!

79
00:06:09,184 --> 00:06:12,083
I found it! Mr. Aoki's painting.

80
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:14,783
But, why is it in there?

81
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:19,183
Sunlight, dust and temperature change are adverse to oil painting!

82
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:21,984
That's probably why he stored it like this, no?

83
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:26,183
It's the same painting that he sent me a photo of.

84
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:27,883
Nope. Look.

85
00:06:27,884 --> 00:06:29,883
Something's been drawn onto it.

86
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:31,283
Huh?

87
00:06:31,284 --> 00:06:33,784
True. There's something in the sky.

88
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:38,284
I think it's our house.

89
00:06:40,084 --> 00:06:42,183
It does look similar.

90
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:46,083
Doesn't this one look like an angel ascending to the sky?

91
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:48,083
So, the white one below

92
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:51,783
is a soul that is guided along by the angel?

93
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:53,983
But Mr. Aoki only drew things

94
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:56,383
that he actually saw with his own eyes, right?

95
00:06:56,384 --> 00:06:59,083
He was probably drunk and hallucinated.

96
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:02,883
Maybe he had a hunch

97
00:07:02,884 --> 00:07:05,584
that he would be ascending to heaven.

98
00:07:10,284 --> 00:07:13,583
That's my husband's digital camera.

99
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:18,083
He always took photos of the things he drew.

100
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:21,783
And he painted while looking at the photos he took.

101
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:23,883
May I see that?

102
00:07:23,884 --> 00:07:25,483
Okay.

103
00:07:25,484 --> 00:07:26,983
Just as I thought!

104
00:07:26,984 --> 00:07:28,583
Just what're you doing?

105
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:30,283
It's been deleted!

106
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,683
The data that was supposed to be used to draw his picture!

107
00:07:33,684 --> 00:07:34,684
What?

108
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:36,683
The "Glowing firefly squid" phenomenon

109
00:07:36,684 --> 00:07:38,183
occurred at night 10 days ago.

110
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:40,983
The data for that day is all gone.

111
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:43,583
True. 10 days ago...

112
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:46,183
The folder for May 6th is gone.

113
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:49,783
Huh? The data in the digital camera's been deleted?

114
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:52,784
Yes. Do you recall anything?

115
00:07:55,484 --> 00:07:58,083
Come to think of it, yesterday night...

116
00:07:58,084 --> 00:08:00,884
I think it was about midnight.

117
00:08:02,884 --> 00:08:04,684
Yes?

118
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:09,984
Mr. Aoki?

119
00:08:12,184 --> 00:08:16,183
The victim was supposedly already dead by then.

120
00:08:16,184 --> 00:08:18,883
It's most likely that the person you saw was not Mr. Aoki

121
00:08:18,884 --> 00:08:22,483
but rather the who killed him.

122
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:25,283
Why didn't you notice back then?

123
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:26,683
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:28,483
It was dark.

125
00:08:28,484 --> 00:08:31,283
And besides, he was dragging his leg,

126
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:33,283
so I just assumed it was him.

127
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:34,683
No doubt about it.

128
00:08:34,684 --> 00:08:36,383
The perp disguised himself as Mr. Aoki

129
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:38,783
and came to delete the photos

130
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:42,283
because there was something he didn't want anyone to see.

131
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:43,683
-I got it! -What?

132
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:46,483
That person was probably a psychic!

133
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,183
Huh? Just what're you talking about?

134
00:08:49,184 --> 00:08:53,183
Because that person went straight to Mr. Aoki's room, right?

135
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:54,783
He wouldn't have know where the room was

136
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,083
unless he was a psychic, right?

137
00:08:58,084 --> 00:08:59,383
True.

138
00:08:59,384 --> 00:09:00,883
It would've been impossible

139
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:03,783
to go straight to his room when there are other rooms, too.

140
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:05,383
In other words, the perp is

141
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:09,384
someone who had visited Mr. Aoki in his room before!

142
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:17,483
Mrs. Aoki looked really depressed.

143
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:20,384
I wonder if it was okay to send her home alone.

144
00:09:22,184 --> 00:09:24,583
Well, after all, her husband passed away.

145
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:25,983
She can't help it.

146
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:29,484
All we need to do now is get the perp.

147
00:09:33,184 --> 00:09:34,483
What?

148
00:09:34,484 --> 00:09:38,783
I already told the police about it just a while ago.

149
00:09:38,784 --> 00:09:41,983
No. I'm not with them.

150
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:44,483
Mrs. Aoki asked you to follow

151
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:48,183
the final tracks of her husband for her, right?

152
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:49,383
Yeah.

153
00:09:49,384 --> 00:09:51,583
If so...

154
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:54,583
Yes, I met Mr. Aoki.

155
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:58,383
I've been searching for my missing girlfriend for sometime

156
00:09:58,384 --> 00:10:01,783
and I went to the inn he was staying at the day before yesterday, too.

157
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:04,083
To pass out these flyers.

158
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:06,183
Your cooperation would be most appreciated.

159
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:09,283
It must be hard, but hang in there, okay?

160
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:11,584
Yes, thank you very much.

161
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:16,684
Sorry.

162
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:24,083
It's no use already.

163
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:25,883
Forget it already.

164
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:28,383
What?

165
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:31,283
I was pissed!

166
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:34,384
But I haven't seen him since then.

167
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,784
I see.

168
00:10:39,184 --> 00:10:43,183
Yes. I met him at sundown the day before yesterday.

169
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,983
I was talking a walk on the beach back then

170
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:49,183
to see the famous mirage here.

171
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:50,684
That's when...

172
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:57,583
He looked to be deeply troubled.

173
00:10:57,584 --> 00:11:00,283
It seemed as if he was contemplating suicide or something.

174
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,183
So, I called out to him.

175
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:05,583
We happen to hit it off well together, you see.

176
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:08,484
So, we spent the entire night drinking in his room till morning.

177
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:12,083
Is that so?

178
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:15,483
Hey, hey. This is...

179
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:16,984
Hey, sonny!

180
00:11:18,284 --> 00:11:21,283
You shouldn't look into other people's bags without permission.

181
00:11:21,284 --> 00:11:22,584
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:26,784
I wonder if Mr. Aoki committed suicide.

183
00:11:29,484 --> 00:11:31,084
Huh?

184
00:11:33,184 --> 00:11:34,983
I'd like these please.

185
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:37,183
Gifts for your family?

186
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:39,884
Yes, for my wife and daughter.

187
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:48,083
And, what did you want?

188
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:50,784
The last person is you.

189
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:55,983
I met him yesterday morning

190
00:11:55,984 --> 00:11:59,484
when I went to deliver fresh fish to the inn.

191
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:04,283
What? That customer didn't even touch the food.

192
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:07,583
Sorry. He says he has no appetite.

193
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:10,183
What? Where's that guy?

194
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:11,483
They are gifts from the sea

195
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:14,483
that we fishermen stake our lives to get a hold of.

196
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:18,983
I can't stand somebody being wasteful like this!

197
00:12:18,984 --> 00:12:21,983
That's why you went to his room to bawl him out?

198
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:25,283
Yeah, but I didn't lay a finger on him.

199
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:28,083
How'd you get that wound?

200
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:30,583
Huh? Oh, this...

201
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,383
I had an accident at sea three years ago

202
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:36,984
and I can't move it well since then.

203
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:46,783
Just who's the perp anyway?

204
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:50,383
None of the three have alibis for the day of the crime.

205
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:53,983
Is this a homicide to begin with?

206
00:12:53,984 --> 00:12:56,983
Or an accident? Suicide?

207
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,883
Darn it! I'm totally lost!

208
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:02,083
Huh? Those people...

209
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:04,683
I wonder what they're looking at?

210
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,383
Probably the spring mirage.

211
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:11,283
Uozu is famous for mirages, you see.

212
00:13:11,284 --> 00:13:12,783
Mirage?

213
00:13:12,784 --> 00:13:15,683
Maybe that was...

214
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:17,284
If so...

215
00:13:22,203 --> 00:13:25,102
I pooped. I'm exhausted.

216
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:28,002
After all, we've been walking around all day.

217
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:31,402
And, did you find him at all?

218
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:34,902
The perp who deleted the video from Mr. Aoki's camera?

219
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:37,502
No, unfortunately not yet.

220
00:13:37,503 --> 00:13:39,702
Is that so?

221
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:42,202
Here, it's almost ready.

222
00:13:42,203 --> 00:13:44,302
It looks delicious.

223
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:47,902
I fished them this afternoon, you see.

224
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,102
You go out to fish, too?

225
00:13:51,103 --> 00:13:52,502
Sometimes.

226
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:55,102
I used to be a fisherman before, you see.

227
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:57,402
Then, please tell me.

228
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,502
Does Mr. Ishiguro always wear a black cap

229
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:02,102
when he goes out to sea?

230
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:04,602
Yeah, he says that it's his lucky charm.

231
00:14:04,603 --> 00:14:06,202
Really?

232
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:07,602
Oh, that's right!

233
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:09,502
Before returning to Tokyo,

234
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:13,302
why not go and watch the late night firefly squid fishing?

235
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:17,902
The sea glows blue and it's really romantic.

236
00:14:17,903 --> 00:14:19,802
What a bother.

237
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:22,002
Oh, come on, let's go!

238
00:14:22,003 --> 00:14:24,103
-Right, Conan? -Huh?

239
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:26,603
Yeah!

240
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,202
Wait, sir.

241
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:34,402
Huh?

242
00:14:34,403 --> 00:14:35,602
What is it?

243
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:38,603
Pops Kogoro asked me to tell you...

244
00:14:40,703 --> 00:14:42,302
I see.

245
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:44,302
Got it. I'll keep an eye out.

246
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:45,303
Please do.

247
00:14:49,203 --> 00:14:51,802
Hey, it's 2:00 after midnight, you know.

248
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:53,902
Are we really going?

249
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:56,102
The boat's leaving at 3:00.

250
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,302
Come on, hurry, let's go!

251
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,702
I'm counting on you, okay?

252
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:02,603
Sure thing. Be careful.

253
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,703
That's it!

254
00:15:33,003 --> 00:15:34,502
You're...

255
00:15:34,503 --> 00:15:37,502
Mr. Mouri, is he really the perp?

256
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,503
Huh?

257
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,703
You said so, didn't you? That the perp would be coming.

258
00:15:44,803 --> 00:15:48,402
Hot pot, beer, and sake...

259
00:15:48,403 --> 00:15:51,502
So, this is the Sleeping Kogoro?

260
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:55,102
I set a trap a while ago.

261
00:15:55,103 --> 00:15:56,802
And told the perp that if we return to Tokyo,

262
00:15:56,803 --> 00:16:01,402
maybe it would be possible to recover the deleted digital camera data.

263
00:16:01,403 --> 00:16:04,802
So, I kept everyone away from this room.

264
00:16:04,803 --> 00:16:08,202
Then, the perp appeared just as expected.

265
00:16:08,203 --> 00:16:10,002
Correct?

266
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:13,702
Owner of this inn, Mr. Taro Hayashi?

267
00:16:13,703 --> 00:16:16,102
Just what're you talking about?

268
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:19,902
I was just trying to protect the camera as I was told to.

269
00:16:19,903 --> 00:16:24,502
The perp of this case needed to satisfy two conditions.

270
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:27,202
First, he had to be left-handed

271
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:29,902
and in addition, be able to operate a boat!

272
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:31,302
Huh?

273
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:36,502
The corpse had a punch bruise on his right cheek.

274
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:37,602
In other words,

275
00:16:37,603 --> 00:16:41,302
it means he was punched from the front with a left hand.

276
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:44,402
But, what with the operating a boat?

277
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:48,902
The perp had deleted the data from Mr. Aoki's camera.

278
00:16:48,903 --> 00:16:52,102
In other words, a clue leading to the perp

279
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:56,002
was drawn in the painting, which was based on the data.

280
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,802
Ran, bring the painting.

281
00:16:57,803 --> 00:16:59,802
Yes, sir.

282
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:01,202
You may have all thought that

283
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:04,302
this painting described an illusionary drawing of a soul

284
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:07,502
ascending to heaven guided along by an angel.

285
00:17:07,503 --> 00:17:10,102
But Mr. Aoki was an artist who only drew things

286
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:11,902
that he actually saw with his own eyes.

287
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:15,202
This was actually reality after all!

288
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:19,002
What? But no matter how you look at it, just cannot be real.

289
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:20,602
It's a mirage.

290
00:17:20,603 --> 00:17:22,302
Mirage?

291
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:25,802
The air near the surface of the water is cooled,

292
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:28,002
and becomes dense during the mirage in spring.

293
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:31,802
Light refracts and on top of the actual scenery,

294
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:36,402
a virtual upside down image called superior mirage appears.

295
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:39,602
In other words, if you turn the painting upside down,

296
00:17:39,603 --> 00:17:43,203
the actual image that is still not drawn will become visible.

297
00:17:44,903 --> 00:17:46,602
This is...

298
00:17:46,603 --> 00:17:47,702
Right.

299
00:17:47,703 --> 00:17:50,902
The white house that is depicted there is a white fishing boat.

300
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,602
The angel ascending to heaven

301
00:17:52,603 --> 00:17:55,102
is a woman that was pushed into the sea.

302
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:57,902
And the soul that is drawn below it

303
00:17:57,903 --> 00:18:00,702
is the white cap of the perp.

304
00:18:00,703 --> 00:18:02,102
In other words, this painting was

305
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:05,803
a drawing of a dreadful murder being committed!

306
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:14,502
After redrawing his painting several times,

307
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:18,702
Mr. Aoki probably realized what had actually happened.

308
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:22,802
Mr. Aoki told Mr. Akagi to forget about his girlfriend

309
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:25,502
stared at the sea with a solemn look

310
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:29,102
and couldn't eat his breakfast because he lost his appetite,

311
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:31,502
all because of what he found out.

312
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:34,502
Then, who is the woman that was killed?

313
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:37,902
The glowing firefly squid that were drawn in the painting

314
00:18:37,903 --> 00:18:39,202
was seen 10 days ago.

315
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:43,702
Mr. Akagi's girlfriend went missing the same day.

316
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:45,602
Judging from her hairstyle and clothes,

317
00:18:45,603 --> 00:18:48,802
there's probably no doubt about it.

318
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:53,602
Mr. Aoki was killed because he found out about this.

319
00:18:53,603 --> 00:18:56,702
In other words, the perp is someone who is left-handed

320
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:59,702
and able to operate a boat.

321
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:02,402
Mr. Akagi who was passing out the flyers with his left hand

322
00:19:02,403 --> 00:19:05,203
is left handed but cannot operate a boat.

323
00:19:05,803 --> 00:19:09,603
Mr. Shirakawa locked the trunk with his right hand.

324
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:12,902
Mr. Ishiguro who is also able to operate a boat

325
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:15,002
cannot use his left hand.

326
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:19,702
And when he goes to sea, he wears a black hat.

327
00:19:19,703 --> 00:19:20,802
In other words,

328
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:24,102
the person who knew that Mr. Aoki was staying in this room...

329
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:27,402
The person who satisfied these two conditions...

330
00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:30,702
That person is the one who held chopsticks using his left hand

331
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:34,502
and served us fish that he himself caught.

332
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:36,402
The owner of this inn!

333
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:39,302
You're the only one who fits!

334
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,502
But that's not enough to...

335
00:19:41,503 --> 00:19:44,302
You mentioned earlier, didn't you?

336
00:19:44,303 --> 00:19:47,402
And, did you find him at all?

337
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:50,703
The perp who deleted the video from Mr. Aoki's camera?

338
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:55,202
It's true that the digital camera can also take videos.

339
00:19:55,203 --> 00:20:00,702
But, how did you know that a video was deleted and not photos?

340
00:20:00,703 --> 00:20:03,802
The ones who know that are, the late Mr. Aoki

341
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:07,803
and the one who deleted the data... the perp!

342
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:13,502
Then, what about him having seen a suspicious character?

343
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:16,502
It's probably an imaginary character

344
00:20:16,503 --> 00:20:18,903
that he made up to keep from being suspected.

345
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:24,303
It was an accident at first.

346
00:20:47,303 --> 00:20:50,703
I didn't think I was being filmed.

347
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:56,702
He tried to persuade me to turn myself in.

348
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,002
He told me to atone for my crime.

349
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:00,503
That's why...

350
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:13,502
I thought I got rid of all the evidence and yet...

351
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:17,403
Darn it!

352
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:45,002
Thank you so very much.

353
00:22:45,003 --> 00:22:46,502
Please cheer up.

354
00:22:46,503 --> 00:22:50,002
Mr. Aoki helped us solve the case.

355
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:54,102
Besides, I'm sure that Mr. Aoki also saved a certain person's life, too.

356
00:22:54,103 --> 00:22:55,202
Huh?

357
00:22:55,203 --> 00:22:57,602
What do you mean, Conan?

358
00:22:57,603 --> 00:22:59,402
Mr. Shirakawa...

359
00:22:59,403 --> 00:23:02,702
He said he came to see the mirage

360
00:23:02,703 --> 00:23:06,502
and yet, he was empty-handed without binoculars or a camera, right?

361
00:23:06,503 --> 00:23:09,302
And the only thing that was in his trunk

362
00:23:09,303 --> 00:23:11,702
were two bottles of sleeping pills.

363
00:23:11,703 --> 00:23:13,202
I think that Mr. Shirakawa probably

364
00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:16,702
came to Uozu intending to commit suicide.

365
00:23:16,703 --> 00:23:20,402
But he was buying gifts for his family at the hotel, right?

366
00:23:20,403 --> 00:23:23,202
That's proof that he decided not to commit suicide.

367
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:26,902
That's why I think that Mr. Aoki was the one who made Mr. Aoki

368
00:23:26,903 --> 00:23:29,203
have second thoughts about committing suicide.

369
00:23:30,603 --> 00:23:33,403
I see! I'm sure that's it!

370
00:23:38,503 --> 00:23:41,403
Yep! I guess so. I'm sure that's it.

371
00:23:42,703 --> 00:23:46,202
"Next Episode"

372
00:23:46,203 --> 00:23:48,102
Rikumichi Kusuda?

373
00:23:48,103 --> 00:23:51,502
Oh, you mean the spy from the Organization that snuck into the hospital

374
00:23:51,503 --> 00:23:53,202
where Reina Mizunashi was staying.

375
00:23:53,203 --> 00:23:55,802
And, what about that?

376
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:58,802
Please tell the people at the FBI

377
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:01,402
to not leak this information to anyone outside!

378
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:03,602
One of the guys of the Organization, Bourbon...

379
00:24:03,603 --> 00:24:06,503
Tohru Amuro is sniffing around, you see!

380
