1
00:00:01,927 --> 00:00:03,927
"Poirot"

2
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:17,127
Thank you for waiting.

3
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:19,427
Your ham sandwich.

4
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:43,227
Hey.

5
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:46,826
That customer's been bothering you for a while, right?

6
00:00:46,827 --> 00:00:47,827
What?

7
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:52,426
-Really? -Yeah, yep...

8
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,726
Dad, you're eating breakfast

9
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:56,226
while reading the horse race newspaper

10
00:00:56,227 --> 00:00:57,726
and yet it's amazing you noticed.

11
00:00:57,727 --> 00:01:00,327
Well, I'm a famed detective after all, you see!

12
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:05,026
From the looks of it, that man's not an officer worker, right?

13
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:09,526
Yet he's here at this time at this coffee shop before going to work.

14
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,527
Is that why he concerns you?

15
00:01:12,627 --> 00:01:14,726
There are customers like him.

16
00:01:14,727 --> 00:01:17,526
We're not much different either.

17
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:19,026
He's not ordering the morning set

18
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:22,226
that most customers here are ordering at this time

19
00:01:22,227 --> 00:01:25,026
but is ordering sandwich

20
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:27,127
without even looking at the menu too.

21
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:30,026
Does that mean he's a regular here?

22
00:01:30,027 --> 00:01:34,526
But, he's not talking to Amuro or Azusa

23
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:38,427
and he's been watching the counter this whole time.

24
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:41,326
It's simple.

25
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:44,226
He's probably got his eyes on Azusa.

26
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:47,226
Oh, I see. You're a detective after all.

27
00:01:47,227 --> 00:01:49,226
I can do something like this hands down!

28
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:51,726
I mean I got my hands on breakfast right now!

29
00:01:51,727 --> 00:01:54,926
No, that man's not looking at Azusa,

30
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:57,527
but rather he's been eyeing Amuro all the way.

31
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:00,327
Why?

32
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:04,426
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

33
00:02:04,427 --> 00:02:06,726
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

34
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,626
Toru Amuro who is working at Poirot.

35
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:10,926
An unexpected person approaches him.

36
00:02:10,927 --> 00:02:12,526
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:14,426
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:16,727
His name is Detective Conan!

39
00:03:57,614 --> 00:04:03,314
"Darkness Creeps Upon Amuro"

40
00:04:04,214 --> 00:04:07,613
What? Playing games at Doc's house again?

41
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,913
I mean that's all we ever do.

42
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:11,813
Then, what else do you want to do?

43
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:13,913
You all have homework to do today, don't you?

44
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:15,713
So do your homework.

45
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,013
Just let's do our homework like Haibara suggested.

46
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:21,914
No, let's play games.

47
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:24,613
Conan?

48
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:28,013
He was at Poirot in the morning too.

49
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:32,413
It could be he lives nearby or works nearby, right?

50
00:04:32,414 --> 00:04:34,613
Why is he so interested in that man?

51
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:37,314
He gets interested in anything and everything.

52
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:42,513
But whenever Conan is interested in something, a case always pops up.

53
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:44,213
Thank you very much.

54
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:45,714
Oh, he came out.

55
00:04:55,214 --> 00:04:57,513
If he bothers you so much, let's follow him.

56
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:59,313
Good idea!

57
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:02,513
It sounds more interesting than playing games at Doc's house.

58
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:05,513
Yep. It's more like the youth detective squad.

59
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,213
Okay. Let's go!

60
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:08,214
Okay.

61
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:11,914
Don't get noticed.

62
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:14,113
Hey, you guys.

63
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,213
Conan, Ai, come on hurry.

64
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:17,613
I pass.

65
00:05:17,614 --> 00:05:19,513
I think you guys should get going home

66
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:21,514
and do your homework too.

67
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:26,013
It's your fault, so make sure you take responsibility

68
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:28,114
and see to it that they go home!

69
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:34,913
What? Conan?

70
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:35,914
Are you alone?

71
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:37,414
Oh, yep.

72
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:41,414
You mean the customer who just left?

73
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:44,613
I don't know his name

74
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:47,513
but now that you mentioned it, he comes a lot recently.

75
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,914
What does he do?

76
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:51,314
Beats me...

77
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:27,513
He's gone! He vanished.

78
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:30,213
I'm sure he went into one of the shops.

79
00:06:30,214 --> 00:06:33,713
Okay, let's split up and check out all the shops!

80
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:35,014
Aye!

81
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,113
He was watching me?

82
00:06:39,114 --> 00:06:41,813
Yes, that's how it looked to me.

83
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:44,913
I guess so. It looked the same to me too.

84
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:47,613
He followed me too the other day.

85
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:49,813
Followed you? When?

86
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:52,413
Three days ago, I think it was...

87
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:55,413
when I went out shopping to a nearby supermarket?

88
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,814
And?

89
00:06:57,714 --> 00:06:59,013
And, what?

90
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:00,513
Are you letting him be?

91
00:07:00,514 --> 00:07:03,913
Well, it's not like he did anything.

92
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:06,014
From the Black Organization, maybe...

93
00:07:07,614 --> 00:07:09,113
That's not a possibility?

94
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:10,413
Nope, no way.

95
00:07:10,414 --> 00:07:12,113
But it's not like

96
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:15,513
you know all of the men in black either, right, Amuro?

97
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:16,813
I guess not...

98
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:20,614
but that man didn't seem to be one of them.

99
00:07:22,914 --> 00:07:27,314
Then, could he be a security police just like you?

100
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:32,414
You really like to scrutinize, don't you?

101
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:42,013
Hey, how was it?

102
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:44,114
No good, he isn't around.

103
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:47,513
We checked all the shops, right?

104
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:50,713
Yes, but he's nowhere.

105
00:07:50,714 --> 00:07:54,114
I think he vanished after all!

106
00:07:57,114 --> 00:07:59,513
No joke.

107
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:01,813
He vanished in the shopping arcade!

108
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,814
Yes, I'm sure he did.

109
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,514
I'm sure he's into something.

110
00:08:06,714 --> 00:08:08,814
Oh, Amuro.

111
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:16,314
What's up, Haibara?

112
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:19,713
I just remembered something, so I'm going home.

113
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:21,414
Ai.

114
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:25,213
It's all your fault, Genta.

115
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,714
Why?

116
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:29,014
It's him.

117
00:08:41,214 --> 00:08:43,713
What does this mean?

118
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:47,613
Yes. I wonder why he's following Amuro around?

119
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:50,214
He's starting to look more and more suspicious.

120
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:12,913
Watch out.

121
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:15,214
It's a dead end up ahead.

122
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:23,514
Can I help you?

123
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,513
Not really...

124
00:09:27,514 --> 00:09:29,413
I have business up ahead.

125
00:09:29,414 --> 00:09:31,814
It's a dead end up ahead.

126
00:09:32,314 --> 00:09:34,213
You're a customer of Poirot who's been coming around

127
00:09:34,214 --> 00:09:35,814
a lot recently, right?

128
00:09:37,414 --> 00:09:39,814
Why are you following me around?

129
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:08,414
-Yes. -Amuro! Emergency!

130
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:10,813
Yes?

131
00:10:10,814 --> 00:10:12,514
Will you go get ice cream?

132
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:15,513
Ice cream?

133
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:20,113
The manager forgot to buy it, but I took an order for cream soda!

134
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:21,914
Please buy it as soon as possible!

135
00:10:24,914 --> 00:10:27,514
I'm leaving him up to you then, Mr. Great Detective.

136
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:47,413
He vanished again.

137
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,714
The same shopping arcade as yesterday.

138
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,113
Let's look through all the shops again!

139
00:10:52,114 --> 00:10:53,314
Okay!

140
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:07,413
Maybe he's...

141
00:11:07,414 --> 00:11:08,814
Thank you for waiting.

142
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:11,414
Here's your ham sandwich.

143
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:14,913
He's not ordering the morning set

144
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:16,913
that most customers here are ordering at this time

145
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:19,514
but is ordering sandwich...

146
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:40,013
He was at Poirot this morning too.

147
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:44,314
It could be that he lives nearby or works nearby, right?

148
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:47,313
He was watching me?

149
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:50,013
Yep, that's how it looked to me.

150
00:11:50,014 --> 00:11:53,213
I guess so. It looked the same to me too.

151
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:55,813
He followed me too the other day.

152
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:57,614
Followed you? When?

153
00:11:58,114 --> 00:12:00,613
Three days ago, I think it was...

154
00:12:00,614 --> 00:12:03,814
when I went out shopping to a nearby supermarket?

155
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:06,414
Conan!

156
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:10,713
No good! He's not in any shop after all.

157
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:12,013
Same here.

158
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:14,314
I wonder about this shop?

159
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:17,413
Nope! He's not here either.

160
00:12:17,414 --> 00:12:19,713
So he disappeared again!

161
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:21,913
No.

162
00:12:21,914 --> 00:12:24,113
I'm sure he'll appear soon.

163
00:12:24,114 --> 00:12:26,414
Huh, appear soon?

164
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,713
Hey, Conan.

165
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:33,113
He sure is late.

166
00:12:33,114 --> 00:12:34,314
Maybe...

167
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:36,013
What?

168
00:12:36,014 --> 00:12:39,713
Amuro found out that the man was following him, right?

169
00:12:39,714 --> 00:12:41,314
Yes. So?

170
00:12:43,714 --> 00:12:44,814
I see!

171
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:47,214
Hey, Conan!

172
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,960
Amuro!

173
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,460
Conan.

174
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,760
Sir, you're...

175
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,759
You're a baker, aren't you?

176
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
What?

177
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:18,660
A baker?

178
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:25,259
You ate sandwiches here in the morning and at sundown, right, sir?

179
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,859
Yes, the sandwich that Amuro made.

180
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,760
He always keeps his fingernails clean.

181
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,460
True.

182
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,360
Moreover, you have a characteristic mark on your forehead.

183
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,059
What is it? That mark on your forehead.

184
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,359
A cap?

185
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,759
Oh, it's the mark of rubber.

186
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,760
Right, the mark made from a cap that can be tightened by rubber.

187
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,559
A cap worn by bakers and noodle makers who handle flour goods

188
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,859
and stay inside kitchen rather than

189
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,059
take care of the customers in the shop.

190
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,759
Come to think of it, that shopping arcade...

191
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,159
No good! He's not in any of the shops.

192
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,359
Nor is he here.

193
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,260
How about this shop?

194
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,859
There was a bakery inside.

195
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,759
If he's the type of baker who doesn't interact with customers,

196
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,959
he most likely makes bread early every morning

197
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,559
and makes more, after noon, to make up for whatever is lacking.

198
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,759
From the looks of it, that man's not an officer worker, right?

199
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,359
Yet he's here at this time at this coffee shop before going to work.

200
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Is that why he concerns you?

201
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,659
There are customers like him.

202
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,559
In other words, your job makes you free most often

203
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,859
in the morning and at sundown, right?

204
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,059
I see! You didn't vanish, but went into the bakery!

205
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,959
So you weren't a customer but someone who worked at the shop!

206
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,859
So, most naturally if we waited in front of that bakery for a while,

207
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,859
you would get changed and appear.

208
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,860
I thought so and waited but...

209
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,360
no matter how long we waited a while ago, you never showed up.

210
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,059
Hey, Conan!

211
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,459
He sure is late.

212
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,959
Maybe...

213
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,259
What?

214
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,059
Amuro found out that the man was following him, right?

215
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,760
And... so?

216
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,359
So, I thought that since Amuro found out about you,

217
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,260
you would act on last resort.

218
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,059
Act on last resort?

219
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,760
You decided to ask him directly, right?

220
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,159
About how to make sandwich from Amuro.

221
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
What?

222
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:36,660
Is that right?

223
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,159
I recently heard that the sandwiches here are cheap and good so...

224
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,960
I came to try some.

225
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,760
I was shocked...

226
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,259
by how delicious they were!

227
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,560
The ham sandwich in particular is superb.

228
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,159
So, I got to thinking I wanted to make sandwiches

229
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,860
that tasted just as good.

230
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,259
But no matter how much I watched how you made it,

231
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,960
I couldn't figure it out.

232
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,960
That's why I followed you.

233
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,559
I checked out

234
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,360
the bread, ham, lettuce and mayonnaise that you bought.

235
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,160
But there was nothing special about anything.

236
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,959
I tried to make it the same way,

237
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,859
but it wouldn't come out the same no matter how I tried.

238
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,060
How do you make sandwiches as delicious as those you make?

239
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,759
That's all I could think of everyday.

240
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,159
I'm on the verge of going nuts already.

241
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,259
Just how?

242
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,160
Just how do you make sandwiches as delicious as yours?

243
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,160
Sir, that's Amuro's business secret.

244
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,559
I'm sure he won't tell you how he...

245
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,459
I know... I know but...

246
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,359
It's okay with me to tell you how.

247
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,360
Oh, really?

248
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,559
Cheap ham will do

249
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,159
but please choose something with as less fat as possible.

250
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,359
You spread olive oil on it.

251
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,759
Oh, I see! The rich taste of that ham was the olive oil!

252
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,959
Yes, but that's not all.

253
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,860
The mayonnaise is ordinary too but...

254
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,159
Huh, miso?

255
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,659
Oh, that's why miso was in the refrigerator.

256
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,560
Only a really small amount for a subtle taste will do.

257
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,859
You mean putting miso inside mayonnaise makes it taste better?

258
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,559
Olive oil and miso really make a great match.

259
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,059
I see. So, that sauce

260
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,159
brings out the flavor of the ham with olive oil on it.

261
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,660
And, this is regular hot water, this is also ordinary lettuce.

262
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,759
When eating sandwich and the contents are cold,

263
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,159
don't you feel that you can taste only the cold

264
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,059
and not get too much of a taste of it?

265
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,959
-Yes. -True.

266
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,759
I never thought of something like that when eating.

267
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,859
Doing this gets rid of such worry.

268
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,259
But won't it get all watery?

269
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,260
No need to worry about that either.

270
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,159
No...

271
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,159
The point is to use water that is only as hot as the water

272
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,959
you take a bath in.

273
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,659
Moreover, by doing this, the lettuce stays crisp for a while

274
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,559
even after you put it in the sandwich.

275
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,859
Amuro, who on earth are you?

276
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,159
Oh, and though the bread is the main material,

277
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,359
"Price cut" -this type of bread will do.

278
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
What?

279
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,159
That's the kind you were using?

280
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,859
This way, I can get it at half price.

281
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,659
I guess so, but...

282
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,159
But, the taste...

283
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,959
Rather, bread that's a bit hard is better.

284
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,659
What? Why?

285
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,459
The secret is this.

286
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,160
A steamer?

287
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,160
Please try touching the bread that is inside.

288
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,659
Fantastic! It's soft and fluffy!

289
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,959
Just before making the sandwich, you steam it a bit.

290
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,859
That way, the bread absorbs as much moisture as it has hardened.

291
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,959
I see.

292
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,159
That's why the bread was warm even though it wasn't toasted.

293
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,559
Moreover, you can keep the price down.

294
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,859
Amuro, you were taking your job

295
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,260
at this coffee shop seriously too, weren't you?

296
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,760
Miso mayonnaise sauce, eh.

297
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,359
But the soft fluffiness you get by doing all this

298
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,659
doesn't keep for long.

299
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,059
That's why it's good to eat at the shop,

300
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,059
but not good for take-out.

301
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,059
I'm a baker.

302
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,959
I can improvise with bread.

303
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,659
Please let me sell your sandwich at my shop!

304
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,159
What?

305
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,359
But, sir... I don't think...

306
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,559
Okay.

307
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,960
You mean... it's okay?

308
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,559
You fell in love with my ham sandwich.

309
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,160
I'd really like someone like you to sell my sandwiches.

310
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,860
"Poirot"

311
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,059
They're ready. Please try them.

312
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,160
Dig in.

313
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,359
-Delicious! -Super soft and fluffy!

314
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,459
This sauce is good.

315
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,659
True. The bread is warm and the contents aren't cold either.

316
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,860
This is it! This taste!

317
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,059
If the customers want to eat it at the shop, they can do so at Poirot

318
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,359
and if they want to take it home, they can buy it at your bakery.

319
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,359
I think it's a great idea.

320
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,959
Thank you very much!

321
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,659
I'll develop bread that can keep soft a fluffy for a long time

322
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,159
and keep the taste of the sandwich as close to yours as possible,

323
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,359
so as to keep up the good reputation that Poirot has made for itself.

324
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,759
Yes. Please do that.

325
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,259
Well...

326
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,259
If you're going to use the name Poirot,

327
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,060
I think we should get permission from the store manager first.

328
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,659
Oh, please excuse me.

329
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,359
Yes, Amuro here.

330
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,060
Hi, Bourbon.

331
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,360
Vermouth.

332
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,759
It seems that you've recently been secretly checking.

333
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,760
Checking? What?

334
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,159
If I knew what, I wouldn't be calling you like this.

335
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,959
I guess not.

336
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,659
Well, you'd better watch yourself.

337
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,759
It seems that they're keeping a close watch over you recently.

338
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,159
Keeping close watch over me...

339
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Who is?

340
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,660
Gin.

341
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,959
What're you looking at?

342
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,759
Kyona Shono's blog.

343
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,159
Come to think of it, she was saying that

344
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,259
the secret of Saya Kitami was written on her blog or whatnots.

345
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,559
Yeah...

346
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,459
Please open the door!

347
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,160
Yes, but...

348
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,560
Kyona?

349
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,659
Next Conan,
