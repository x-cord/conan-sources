1
00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:22,946
Today's stage is also at the breakwater.

2
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:24,646
The place was in such clear view and conspicuous.

3
00:00:24,647 --> 00:00:26,446
The trick and the culprit, we'all catch them both!

4
00:00:26,447 --> 00:00:27,946
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,947 --> 00:00:29,846
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,847 --> 00:00:31,747
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54,377 --> 00:01:55,777
Hey, Ejiri?

8
00:01:55,802 --> 00:01:58,002
Get a hold of yourself! Snap out of it!

9
00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:01,376
His lips are turning purple,

10
00:02:01,377 --> 00:02:03,676
cyanosis is starting.

11
00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:06,277
This is proof that he cannot breathe as he should.

12
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:11,376
Still I can feel his pulse by touch,

13
00:02:11,377 --> 00:02:14,276
and his heart is beating quite okay,

14
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:17,276
which means possible brain damage

15
00:02:17,277 --> 00:02:20,277
or neurotoxic poisoning!

16
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,676
Artificial respiration!

17
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:28,776
We've got to take this man on the ship

18
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:30,177
and head him off to the hospital!

19
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:33,076
Hang in there, okay, Ejiri?

20
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:34,277
Hurry!

21
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:40,276
Dear!

22
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:41,677
Don't move!

23
00:02:42,977 --> 00:02:47,176
It's extremely likely that he was poisoned!

24
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:49,976
And the one who poisoned him

25
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:54,277
is possibly someone who is here at the breakwater!

26
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,776
Until the police get here,

27
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:02,376
don't touch anything and stay still!

28
00:03:02,377 --> 00:03:04,276
What's up?

29
00:03:04,277 --> 00:03:06,377
Who are you, sonny?

30
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:10,176
Conan Edogawa.

31
00:03:10,177 --> 00:03:11,577
A detective.

32
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:18,577
"Tragedy of the Conspicuous Pier (Part 2)"

33
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:22,476
First,

34
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:25,276
let's start with hearing about how you are all connected with each other.

35
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:26,876
"Kiriko Shirane (38), Mineto Kanetani (39)" -All of us

36
00:03:26,877 --> 00:03:30,476
belonged to the same fishing club since our university days.

37
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,976
Including Ejiri, who was carried off a while ago too.

38
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:37,176
Do you come to fish at this breakwater frequently?

39
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:38,177
Yeah.

40
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:41,376
"Iwao Ida (39)" -On board the ship of the fisherman Ida.

41
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:45,776
Which means all of you know each other quite well from some time back.

42
00:03:45,777 --> 00:03:48,276
Yes, especially Ida and I

43
00:03:48,277 --> 00:03:49,976
because our parents who are fishermen also know each other well.

44
00:03:49,977 --> 00:03:51,976
We've known each other since we were kids.

45
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:55,676
I see! You were saying that you're the daughter of a fisherman.

46
00:03:55,677 --> 00:03:59,476
Yeah, she's really knowledgeable about fish

47
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:01,476
and was really popular with men in the club too.

48
00:04:01,477 --> 00:04:04,076
Moreover, she's a good cook and a beauty.

49
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,576
She was the Madonna of the fishing club.

50
00:04:06,577 --> 00:04:08,576
Please cut it out, Kanetani.

51
00:04:08,577 --> 00:04:10,476
Let's not talk about something so long in the past.

52
00:04:10,477 --> 00:04:13,077
Is that why someone attempted to kill Mr. Ejiri?

53
00:04:14,577 --> 00:04:18,076
Because Ms. Shirane was taken away by Mr. Ejiri.

54
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:19,676
What are you talking about?

55
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:20,876
Just a while ago,

56
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:22,876
when Ms. Shirane was about to run over to him,

57
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:25,876
she called him "dear".

58
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:29,176
Unless they have an intimate relationship,

59
00:04:29,177 --> 00:04:31,576
she wouldn't be calling him that way, would she?

60
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:32,976
Then, the perp is the one

61
00:04:32,977 --> 00:04:35,676
who had to go through a broken heart and held a grudge against him.

62
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:38,077
Mr. Kanetani! You did it, didn't you?

63
00:04:40,377 --> 00:04:42,376
Don't be ridiculous!

64
00:04:42,377 --> 00:04:44,176
Besides if that was my motive,

65
00:04:44,177 --> 00:04:47,476
the fisherman Ida would also come up as a suspect.

66
00:04:47,477 --> 00:04:49,476
What? Mr. Ida?

67
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:53,576
Because Ida was Shirane's fiance.

68
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:55,476
Fiance?

69
00:04:55,477 --> 00:04:57,776
Besides, that's not possible.

70
00:04:57,777 --> 00:04:59,676
Why not?

71
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:04,576
Because Ejiri and I got a divorce three years ago.

72
00:05:04,577 --> 00:05:06,276
Huh? Why?

73
00:05:06,277 --> 00:05:08,176
Well, a lot of things were involved.

74
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:11,076
But the fact that we both like fishing hasn't changed.

75
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,176
So on holidays or on our day off,

76
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:14,476
we invite Kanetani and come fishing together.

77
00:05:14,477 --> 00:05:18,576
And? You always made everyone's lunch?

78
00:05:18,577 --> 00:05:22,176
See, this lunch that Ejiri ate.

79
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:25,576
The size of the lunch box and the handkerchief it's wrapped in

80
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:30,276
is the same as the one Mr. Kanetani got from Ms. Shirane.

81
00:05:30,277 --> 00:05:33,276
It's true that it looks just like Mr. Kanetani's lunch.

82
00:05:33,277 --> 00:05:35,477
Don't tell me that the lunch was poisoned.

83
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:39,076
No way! I would never do something like that!

84
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:42,476
Besides, as far as that lunch is concerned,

85
00:05:42,477 --> 00:05:44,776
I got it from Shirane on our way to the breakwater

86
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,176
and I gave it directly to Ejiri.

87
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:50,876
The lunch boxes are exactly alike and nobody knows who'll get it.

88
00:05:50,877 --> 00:05:54,076
How can poison be put in something like that?

89
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:55,377
That's true.

90
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:58,976
The pole stand is in the water?

91
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:03,576
This is one of the two that Mr. Ejiri had erected.

92
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:07,577
The other pole stand is still standing okay, and yet why?

93
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,876
This case sure is hard to grasp.

94
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:24,376
Maybe the poison was smeared on the hook and swung around?

95
00:06:24,377 --> 00:06:27,376
I see, the way they do in lure fishing.

96
00:06:27,377 --> 00:06:28,876
That can't be.

97
00:06:28,877 --> 00:06:30,576
Besides, it would be to difficult to pinpoint the part

98
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:32,276
where the skin is exposed in one fling.

99
00:06:32,277 --> 00:06:34,676
If it works, it's just mere chance!

100
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:37,676
And if the poisoned hook is soaked in water for some time,

101
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:39,676
the poison would drift off.

102
00:06:39,677 --> 00:06:41,976
So, the lunch was poisoned after all.

103
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:44,876
No, it's very unlikely.

104
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:48,476
If poison were to be in something that was chewed on,

105
00:06:48,477 --> 00:06:52,876
I would've been poisoned too because I performed artificial respiration.

106
00:06:52,877 --> 00:06:53,976
I see!

107
00:06:53,977 --> 00:06:58,576
Which means that you knew he wasn't poisoned from the mouth.

108
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:04,176
No. I can't figure out where the poison was inserted.

109
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:07,976
And all I knew back then was that I had to perform artificial respiration

110
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:11,277
or he would've died there.

111
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:17,376
Hey, you!

112
00:07:17,377 --> 00:07:20,076
Can't this ship go any faster?

113
00:07:20,077 --> 00:07:22,977
Please stop rushing, officer.

114
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,876
What's this smell?

115
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:27,976
Hey, isn't smoke coming out?

116
00:07:27,977 --> 00:07:31,176
Well, you're the one who keeps telling me to go faster!

117
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:33,676
The police sure are late.

118
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:36,976
They sure are. Well, I guess everything'll be okay!

119
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:40,576
The culprit is one of the two anyway!

120
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:43,176
As long as we keep are eyes on them.

121
00:07:43,177 --> 00:07:46,876
Right, the fisherman wasn't here with us all this time so.

122
00:07:46,877 --> 00:07:49,576
You can't be too sure.

123
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:51,576
If he made Mr. Ejiri drink some sleeping drug

124
00:07:51,577 --> 00:07:56,376
with delayed effect beforehand.

125
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:58,676
When he came to pick us up,

126
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:02,076
he could've gone up to Mr. Ejiri to check out what was wrong

127
00:08:02,077 --> 00:08:04,376
and poke him with a poison needle then.

128
00:08:04,377 --> 00:08:05,876
Hey, wait!

129
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:09,976
You mean you let a possible killer and Dr. Agasa go together?

130
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:14,276
Yeah. There was no other way to save Mr. Ejiri's life.

131
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:15,776
I did give Dr. Agasa the tranquilizer gun though,

132
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:19,476
just in case something comes up.

133
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:23,277
Besides, if anything happens, Dr. Agasa 's going to call...

134
00:08:24,477 --> 00:08:26,076
The phone?

135
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:27,576
Hello, Dr. Agasa?

136
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:29,976
-Hello... -Oh, Shinichi!

137
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:33,876
I just got Mr. Ejiri on the ambulance now!

138
00:08:33,877 --> 00:08:35,476
And, how is he?

139
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:37,276
It's hard to say yet.

140
00:08:37,277 --> 00:08:40,676
The type of poison hasn't been specified either.

141
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:44,076
Maybe if a doctor were to examine his left wrist

142
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:46,876
the type of poison may be specified.

143
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:48,076
Left wrist?

144
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:49,176
Right!

145
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:51,276
Although it was hidden with his sleeve,

146
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:55,076
there were traces of scratches there.

147
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,076
I'm sure that's how he was poisoned.

148
00:08:58,077 --> 00:09:02,876
Incidentally, there was something that looked like glue on the sleeve!

149
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:05,076
Glue? You mean the plastic type?

150
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:09,476
Yeah. That stuff is not used for fishing, so isn't it odd?

151
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:12,776
Well, I'll give you the details when I get there.

152
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:13,976
Later, then.

153
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:16,376
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

154
00:09:16,377 --> 00:09:17,676
Glue.

155
00:09:17,677 --> 00:09:19,776
What did Dr. Agasa say?

156
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:21,976
He said he got Mr. Ejiri on an ambulance

157
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:24,176
so he's coming back here!

158
00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:26,976
-That's great! -I guess everything's okay for now.

159
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:30,176
I wonder who the culprit is though?

160
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:34,076
He taught me how to put bait on my hook.

161
00:09:34,077 --> 00:09:35,576
And, the lady, see!

162
00:09:35,577 --> 00:09:39,176
She picked this bobber that got drifted away up for me.

163
00:09:39,177 --> 00:09:41,176
She said she saw it floating in the water

164
00:09:41,177 --> 00:09:44,676
so she picked it up with a net.

165
00:09:44,677 --> 00:09:46,876
The fisherman seems to have taken Mr. Ejiri

166
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:51,476
to where the ambulance came to pick him up too.

167
00:09:51,477 --> 00:09:55,976
At first, he seemed to be looking down on us because we're kids, but...

168
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:59,376
You mean when he told you not to make too much noise?

169
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:01,576
Yes. We may be kids,

170
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:02,976
but we won't dance or carrying around portable shrines

171
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,876
in a place like this!

172
00:10:04,877 --> 00:10:06,076
Right?

173
00:10:06,077 --> 00:10:07,576
Dancing and carrying portable shrines?

174
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:11,176
Hey. Tell me exactly what the fisherman said.

175
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,376
Let me think...

176
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:13,676
He said, don't make too much noise

177
00:10:13,677 --> 00:10:16,676
and start an "Omatsuri" (Omatsuri means festival) with your friends!

178
00:10:16,677 --> 00:10:19,076
I told him we won't start an "Omatsuri",

179
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:23,976
then he said, go ask the other people.

180
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:26,877
No. "Omatsuri" is fishing terminology...

181
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:31,676
Bobber, glue and "omatsuri".

182
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:34,376
I see. So, that's it!

183
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:35,576
Conan?

184
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:38,676
Don't tell me you've figured out who the culprit is!

185
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:40,076
Yeah. I figured out

186
00:10:40,077 --> 00:10:44,076
who was trying to fish Mr. Ejiri's life with a poison hook

187
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,777
as well as the way it was done!

188
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:55,938
Sea bream! This is sea bream for sure!

189
00:10:57,538 --> 00:11:01,137
Okay, all of you, enough for the detective thing already, right?

190
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:02,138
No!

191
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:05,337
You're saying that so that you can hide the evidence, right?

192
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:09,737
Listen. It's true that Ejiri didn't look all that great.

193
00:11:09,738 --> 00:11:13,937
But we're not even sure if he was really poisoned or not yet, you know?

194
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:15,037
In the first place,

195
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:18,037
Ida, who took Ejiri to where the ambulance,

196
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:20,137
is a suspect too, right?

197
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,937
If he's the one,

198
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:26,037
then the evidence would've been disposed in the sea long time ago.

199
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:27,737
I guess so, but...

200
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:28,937
That's no problem

201
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,937
because Dr. Agasa who went with him, is keeping an eye on him.

202
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:35,237
Moreover, the possibility of Mr. Ida being the culprit

203
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:37,737
has drastically decreased.

204
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,637
Now that we know he safely took Mr. Ejiri to the ambulance

205
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:44,938
and is heading back this way with Dr. Agasa again.

206
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,037
Is that right, Conan?

207
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:49,038
Remember what I said?

208
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,137
If Mr. Ida were the culprit,

209
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:54,937
he would've had to run over to Mr. Ejiri that he put to sleep beforehand

210
00:11:54,938 --> 00:11:57,637
and poke a poison needle into him.

211
00:11:57,638 --> 00:12:00,637
The poison that was used is probably neurotoxic poison.

212
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:03,337
He would have difficulty breathing but he would be conscious.

213
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:07,337
If someone poked a poison needle into him, he would know who it was.

214
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:11,637
The culprit would never rush such a person to the hospital, right?

215
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:14,337
Even if he would've done so, not to be suspected,

216
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:16,837
he would've fled off somewhere already.

217
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:19,937
Because when the poison wears off and Mr. Ejiri is able to talk,

218
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:22,137
the culprit would be revealed.

219
00:12:22,138 --> 00:12:23,337
I see.

220
00:12:23,338 --> 00:12:28,738
So that means the culprit has to be either Ms. Shirane or Mr. Kanetani.

221
00:12:32,738 --> 00:12:35,937
Hey, how long is it going to take you to make repairs?

222
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:38,737
Please don't rush me like that, officer!

223
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:43,437
Darn it. We still have no idea what kind of case it is, and yet...

224
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:48,537
Are you saying either one of us is the one who poisoned Ejiri?

225
00:12:48,538 --> 00:12:50,837
Don't be ridiculous.

226
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:55,537
It's true that we were fishing on both side of Ejiri,

227
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:59,237
but he was fishing on the tip of the tetra pod,

228
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:02,937
so he more than 10 m away from us.

229
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:05,837
How could we have poisoned him?

230
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:07,437
"Omatsuri".

231
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:08,637
"Omatsuri"?

232
00:13:08,638 --> 00:13:11,337
"Omatsuri" is a fishing terminology

233
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:14,937
that is used when two lines get tangled with each other.

234
00:13:14,938 --> 00:13:17,837
You know what to do when that happens, right?

235
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,537
I see! The culprit took advantage of him wanting to untangle his line,

236
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:24,037
in which he would bring his fish hook near his hand!

237
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:27,037
So, the comment of the fisherman...

238
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:28,038
Don't make too much noise

239
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,937
and start an "Omatsuri" (festival) with your friends.

240
00:13:29,938 --> 00:13:33,137
was not an insulting remark at all.

241
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:35,137
Right. The culprit deliberately

242
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:38,737
got the fishing line tangled with Mr. Ejiri's.

243
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:40,837
And, when Mr. Ejiri tried to untangle the line,

244
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:42,537
it's slightly pulled on

245
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:46,037
and the poisoned hook would sink into Mr. Ejiri's hand!

246
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:48,537
But, you did also say that

247
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:51,637
if the hook smeared with poison is soaked in the water for some time,

248
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:54,037
the poison would dissolve.

249
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:56,537
Yeah... If the poison was just smeared on to the hook,

250
00:13:56,538 --> 00:13:59,337
then the poison would dissolve,

251
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,937
but it's a different story if glue is used.

252
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:03,637
-Glue? -Glue?

253
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:06,037
Yeah. If poison is mixed into the glue

254
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:07,537
and then smeared onto the hook and dried hard.

255
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:11,737
It would start to dissolve when soaked in salt water

256
00:14:11,738 --> 00:14:14,737
and by the time it gets tangled with Mr. Ejiri's line.

257
00:14:14,738 --> 00:14:18,437
It would be gooey and just right for use.

258
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:19,737
As proof of this,

259
00:14:19,738 --> 00:14:23,337
Dr. Agasa just told me on the phone that

260
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:26,337
there was glue on the left sleeve of Mr. Ejiri's shirt.

261
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:27,737
He also mentioned that

262
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:32,237
there were traces of scratch marks on Mr. Ejiri's left wrist!

263
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:37,337
That's probably why Mr. Ejiri's pole stand was in the water too.

264
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:38,737
His pole stand?

265
00:14:38,738 --> 00:14:44,937
Yeah. When the fishing line was pulled to sink the poison hook in,

266
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:49,037
the pole stand was pulled too and fell into the water as well.

267
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:51,337
But, can you really do something like

268
00:14:51,338 --> 00:14:55,537
deliberately getting your own line tangled with somebody else's.

269
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:56,837
Of course you can!

270
00:14:56,838 --> 00:15:01,137
You use a lot of hooks with poison smeared on them and use light sinkers.

271
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:04,137
Then you let it drift along to the flow of the current

272
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:06,237
and it gets tangled super easily.

273
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,437
If the poisoned hook is a fly hook,

274
00:15:09,438 --> 00:15:11,037
when it is pulled up,

275
00:15:11,038 --> 00:15:13,137
even if there were to be many hooks attached to it,

276
00:15:13,138 --> 00:15:15,737
nothing strange would be thought of it!

277
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:16,837
I see.

278
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:20,437
And? Which of them did that?

279
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:21,438
I just said, didn't I?

280
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:24,337
That the line was tangled using the flow of the current, right?

281
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:28,437
Remember she picked up your bobber that drifted away, Ayumi?

282
00:15:28,438 --> 00:15:30,837
Yes! She did.

283
00:15:30,838 --> 00:15:33,437
In other words, if Ms. Shirane, who was on the right edge,

284
00:15:33,438 --> 00:15:35,037
picked up your bobber,

285
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:37,637
the flow of the current was from left to right.

286
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:41,937
And if the culprit took advantage of the flow of the current.

287
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:45,337
Right, the one who was fishing between Mr. Ejiri and all of us.

288
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:47,437
Mr. Kanetani!

289
00:15:47,438 --> 00:15:49,637
You're the one who did it, right?

290
00:15:49,638 --> 00:15:53,237
Wait... Is that true, Kanetani?

291
00:15:53,238 --> 00:15:57,537
No way. No need to take what kids say all that seriously.

292
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:59,937
Besides, what makes you think I'd do something like that

293
00:15:59,938 --> 00:16:02,537
at a breakwater like this?

294
00:16:02,538 --> 00:16:03,937
I mean there're only so many of us

295
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:05,937
and the possibility of becoming a suspect is so high.

296
00:16:05,938 --> 00:16:10,237
No. The suspects were narrowed down merely because of coincidence.

297
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:13,337
Back then, if the fish didn't bite his line,

298
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:16,437
we won't go over thinking that it's strange that he showed no reaction.

299
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:19,937
If he was left as he is, time would just pass by,

300
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:25,837
the estimated time of death would've been expanded

301
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:28,537
and there would've been a lot more suspects.

302
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:30,237
And you're the very one who said that

303
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:32,237
you wanted to change fishing spots because no fish were biting.

304
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:33,437
I see.

305
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:36,037
So, Mr. Ejiri who said that he wanted to stick it out here till night,

306
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,537
would've been left behind alone.

307
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,137
And if everyone else moves to a new fishing spot,

308
00:16:40,138 --> 00:16:41,937
it could've been made to look as if someone came along in a boat

309
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:45,837
and poisoned Mr. Ejiri who was fishing all by himself.

310
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,537
Yeah. Besides, there are many people here that would testify that.

311
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:53,137
Mr. Kanetani never once went near Mr. Ejiri too.

312
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:56,437
But if the hook poked him, he would at least let out a cry.

313
00:16:56,438 --> 00:16:59,738
So, you set the timing for when to hook it on, right?

314
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:04,337
That is, to the sound of the ship that came to pick us up.

315
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:06,137
Oh, Dr. Agasa!

316
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:07,138
I see!

317
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:08,937
He erased the sound of the scream of pain

318
00:17:08,938 --> 00:17:10,937
when being poked with the sound of the of the ship!

319
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:12,537
Moreover, the direction the ship came

320
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:14,937
from was opposite the direction that everyone was fishing.

321
00:17:14,938 --> 00:17:17,237
Everybody attention would be distracted from Mr. Ejiri,

322
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:19,937
so it would be like killing two birds with one stone.

323
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:23,337
But, sonny, you don't even have proof.

324
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:25,737
This pole of yours is the evidence.

325
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:27,737
The bobber is sunk

326
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:29,938
so it should still be there.

327
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:35,938
Mr. Ejiri's pole that got tangled with your terminal tackle!

328
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:41,537
The glue that was mixed with poison probably almost completely dissolved.

329
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:44,037
But, that would not dissolve so easily.

330
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:49,038
Mr. Ejiri's blood that is on the hook that scratched him.

331
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,037
Kanetani.

332
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,437
Kanetani, may I ask why you did it?

333
00:17:56,438 --> 00:17:59,137
Why would you want to kill him?

334
00:17:59,138 --> 00:18:02,337
We just went drinking the other day all three of us together, didn't we?

335
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:06,837
The reason is his remark when we went drinking.

336
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:10,237
When you left the seat,

337
00:18:10,238 --> 00:18:13,437
I asked him why you both got a divorce.

338
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:15,037
What? A lover?

339
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,737
Yeah. I just started a new business back then

340
00:18:19,738 --> 00:18:22,237
and I was going through a lot of stress.

341
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:27,837
She found out that I was having an affair and left me.

342
00:18:27,838 --> 00:18:29,837
He said that?

343
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:33,437
Yeah. I had no intention of saying anything

344
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:36,837
about the fact that he got a divorce of had a lover,

345
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:41,937
but I just couldn't forget what he said after all that.

346
00:18:41,938 --> 00:18:45,237
Well, I guess in the end, be it a company, fish or women,

347
00:18:45,238 --> 00:18:48,037
the best part is when they are alive and kicking.

348
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:49,837
Don't tell her this, okay?

349
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:54,037
Yeah, it was like he had shattered the dream of my younger days.

350
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:56,937
I just couldn't take it in.

351
00:18:56,938 --> 00:19:00,237
Because you were really our Madonna.

352
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:01,437
Don't be silly.

353
00:19:01,438 --> 00:19:05,837
He divorced me for my sake.

354
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:06,838
What?

355
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:11,037
Back then, his company was on the verge of bankruptcy.

356
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,437
And he couldn't save his employees unless he started a new business.

357
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:19,337
But, in order to do so, he had to take on an enormous amount of debt.

358
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:23,137
He got on his hands and knees begging me to divorce him.

359
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:25,237
He begged me saying that if the new business fails,

360
00:19:25,238 --> 00:19:29,537
I'd end up having to face the collectors too.

361
00:19:29,538 --> 00:19:33,037
I wanted to overcome the situation as husband and wife.

362
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,737
But since his stubborn and not too strong taking on pressure.

363
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:42,037
And as for me, I wanted to continue my job as a cuisine essayist I agreed.

364
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:47,037
So, that thing about a lover is a story he made up to put on a front.

365
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:49,537
I don't like that comment

366
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:51,737
he made of women who are alive and kicking though.

367
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:54,437
No, there's no need to get angry.

368
00:19:54,438 --> 00:19:55,637
Because he was referring to you,

369
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:59,037
when he said women who are alive and kicking.

370
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:01,437
While sailing on the swaying boat,

371
00:20:01,438 --> 00:20:04,337
Mr. Ejiri kept repeating to himself over and over again.

372
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:05,937
A fish that is truly alive and kicking

373
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,937
is one that can freely swim through the ocean.

374
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:12,637
He asked me if I thought so too.

375
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:13,638
What an idiot.

376
00:20:14,738 --> 00:20:18,737
Oh, my God. What on earth have I done?

377
00:20:18,738 --> 00:20:22,837
Don't worry! He seems to have recovered quite a bit already.

378
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:28,437
I got a call from Ejiri, who sounded okay.

379
00:20:28,438 --> 00:20:31,637
He asked me to relay a message to you.

380
00:20:31,638 --> 00:20:36,437
He said for you to get super fresh fish for her today.

381
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:38,737
If you do, he says he'll forget what happened today.

382
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,937
He said he would tell the hospital and police that

383
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:43,537
he was poisoned by a pufferfish that he cooked and ate on his own,

384
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:46,537
so to not come back until you get big catch.

385
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,537
Is today a special day or something?

386
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:53,637
Oh, my? Come to think of it, today is our wedding anniversary.

387
00:20:53,638 --> 00:20:56,737
Your anniversary? If I'm not mistaken today is...

388
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:59,337
Don't tell me you forgot?

389
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:02,437
Happy Birthday, Dr. Agasa!

390
00:21:02,438 --> 00:21:05,337
Kojima, which means that you were trying to...

391
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:09,037
Yeah, fish something for Dr. Agasa's birthday present!

392
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,537
No, Genta! Don't say a word about it!

393
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:13,337
We've been keeping it a secret from Ai too

394
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,637
so that we could throw a surprise party.

395
00:21:15,638 --> 00:21:17,437
Oh, sorry...

396
00:21:17,438 --> 00:21:19,937
I see. That's why these children

397
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:23,137
were planning to have a curry party at my house tonight.

398
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:25,037
Thank you all so much.

399
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:26,137
Don't cry.

400
00:21:26,138 --> 00:21:27,637
I was trying to fish you a sea bream

401
00:21:27,638 --> 00:21:30,637
but ended up fishing some odd black fish.

402
00:21:30,638 --> 00:21:33,037
Hey. Isn't this is black sea bream?

403
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:34,137
Black sea bream?

404
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:37,037
The King of breakwater fishing, black sea bream!

405
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:38,537
It's an expensive fish!

406
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:40,037
Incredible!

407
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:43,037
-It's too much for Dr. Agasa, then. -I'd love to eat it.

408
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,637
So now it's your turn, Kanetani!

409
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:51,137
Get me a big one that is just as good as the one he fished, okay?

410
00:21:51,138 --> 00:21:53,538
Because I've got to show him that.

411
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:57,738
That even if fish are caught, good fish is good.

412
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:31,337
Well, although there were an array of odd occurrences,

413
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:34,737
wasn't coming to the ocean a good idea?

414
00:23:34,738 --> 00:23:36,237
Yes.

415
00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:38,637
Now I understand how fish feel.

416
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:40,937
Just what do you mean by that?

417
00:23:40,938 --> 00:23:45,337
The body temperature of humans is too warm for the fish.

418
00:23:45,338 --> 00:23:49,537
Right, it's too warm for me too

419
00:23:49,538 --> 00:23:51,238
that I feel as if I'm going to get burned.

420
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:56,338
Hey, hey, it's still not repaired?

421
00:23:57,838 --> 00:24:01,838
"Next Episode."

422
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:07,138
Hey... No way!

423
00:24:11,638 --> 00:24:13,737
So she was being used.

424
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:15,538
But you're not having it your way!

425
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:21,738
I want to run away.

426
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:27,938
