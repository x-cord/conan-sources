1
00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:05,274
Oh, right.

2
00:00:05,275 --> 00:00:09,774
Did you see that "God of Ramen Championship" on TV last night?

3
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:11,074
I saw it.

4
00:00:11,075 --> 00:00:15,075
I sure want to eat that miso ramen that made it to the finals.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,875
I want salted ramen!

6
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:24,475
No. I tell you the shoyu ramen that won the championship is the best!

7
00:00:26,575 --> 00:00:29,574
Which ramen did you like, Conan?

8
00:00:29,575 --> 00:00:31,274
Who, me?

9
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:33,175
Tonkotsu ramen, I think.

10
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:36,574
Tonkotsu, huh?

11
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:40,174
Come to think of it, the tonkotsu ramen looked good, too.

12
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:41,175
Yeah.

13
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:45,074
I mean, how come you girls are so stuck on that ramen special program.

14
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:48,274
I like the way the noodles are all curly.

15
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:51,574
The tonkotsu soup looked rich, too.

16
00:00:51,575 --> 00:00:54,475
The Char-sui was so soft.

17
00:00:57,475 --> 00:01:01,774
Oh, no. Talking about ramen is making me want to eat some.

18
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:02,974
Right.

19
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:05,474
Then, would you like to go?

20
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:08,874
To the ramen shop that I frequently go to!

21
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,074
Huh?

22
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:12,774
What?

23
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:14,474
But maybe not.

24
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:17,874
You won't be able to eat dinner.

25
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,174
Come to think of it,

26
00:01:19,175 --> 00:01:23,374
Dad was saying he's going out drinking with the neighbors tonight.

27
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,274
Shall we have ramen for dinner, Conan?

28
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:27,375
Yep.

29
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:35,774
Hello. It's me!

30
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:38,574
I'll be eating dinner with Ran and the others and go home after that.

31
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:43,674
So, will you cancel my French dinner for tonight?

32
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:46,874
-Ramen over French cuisine. -Bye!

33
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,774
It's been my dream

34
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,174
to eat ramen with my friends after school, you see.

35
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:53,374
Really?

36
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:56,074
What a small dream, Ms. Richie.

37
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:58,574
Well, I'll guarantee the taste!

38
00:01:58,575 --> 00:02:01,674
It's known to be ramen so good to die for!

39
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:02,874
Huh?

40
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,375
That's...

41
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:09,074
A canvas stained black with crime.

42
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:11,374
Vivid brilliant deduction skills changes its color!

43
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,474
The three girls go to Ramen Ogura.

44
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:15,874
Good Enough to Die For that leads to an incident?

45
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,474
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:19,374
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,775
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:06,272
"Ramen Good Enough to Die For: 2 (Part 1)"

49
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:09,172
"Ogura Ramen, Good Enough to Die For"

50
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:11,772
I thought so.

51
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:13,272
Hello!

52
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:15,072
Hi!

53
00:04:15,073 --> 00:04:18,672
Boss! I brought some friends with me today!

54
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:20,172
Hello.

55
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,972
Yeah! Thanks, Mari!

56
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:26,772
Like I keep telling you, I'm Masumi, not Mari.

57
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:28,172
Is that so?

58
00:04:28,173 --> 00:04:30,672
Hi, Conan. Long time no see!

59
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:32,072
Are you alone today?

60
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:35,872
Nope. I'm with the girls.

61
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:38,372
You've been here before?

62
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:41,672
Yep! To the shop before they moved here!

63
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:43,773
Back then, there was this incident, you see.

64
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:51,972
Yeah. I'm sure the perp still has it.

65
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:55,573
Mr. Saizu's belongings laced with poison!

66
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,972
We weren't hypnotized or anything.

67
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:02,272
We would never make anyone touch them carefreely.

68
00:05:02,273 --> 00:05:04,872
I'm sure he'll touch it!

69
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:08,873
When you go inside a warm shop like a ramen shop...

70
00:05:11,073 --> 00:05:12,673
Your glasses will turn this way.

71
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:17,472
I see. You solved a murder by poison case?

72
00:05:17,473 --> 00:05:19,372
You really can handle, can't you, Conan?

73
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:23,172
Well, I didn't solve it, Pops did!

74
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:27,173
But you helped out a lot too, Conan and were fantastic.

75
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:31,472
Here you go, King Yama ramen.

76
00:05:31,473 --> 00:05:34,372
Thank you for waiting.

77
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:36,273
-Looks good! -Looks good!

78
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,972
What's this? This is seriously fantastically good!

79
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:54,372
-Really! -I told you so.

80
00:05:54,373 --> 00:05:56,172
And, what would you like to do?

81
00:05:56,173 --> 00:06:01,372
Are you ordering one serving of fried rice and pot sticks to go, Mari?

82
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:05,372
I said, my name's Masumi.

83
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:08,272
-Okay, I'll take that! -Okay.

84
00:06:08,273 --> 00:06:10,572
Don't tell me you're going to eat fried rice

85
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:12,072
and pot sticks for a midnight snack?

86
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:13,572
You're going to get fat.

87
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,272
No, no! It's for breakfast!

88
00:06:16,273 --> 00:06:19,372
Because the food here is good even after it gets cold!

89
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:23,672
Maybe it could be for the someone

90
00:06:23,673 --> 00:06:25,973
you're sheltering at the hotel.

91
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:28,472
Right.

92
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:32,172
It's for my boyfriend that I'm secretly living together with.

93
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:33,672
What?

94
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:36,372
It's a joke, only joking.

95
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,272
Excuse me.

96
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,372
"Yuna Shono (34), Hostess" -Will you pass the vinegar that's by you?

97
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:43,872
The one over here's all gone.

98
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:47,572
Then, will you take that shoyu bottle over there for me?

99
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,972
"Sosuke Mizushina (29), Freelancer" -There's just a little left.

100
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:55,372
You ask for it after you use it all up!

101
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,272
But it's going to get empty right away, anyway.

102
00:06:58,273 --> 00:06:59,472
Oops.

103
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:01,372
"Osamu Nakanishi (48), Company Employee"

104
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:04,172
The pepper bottle is completely empty.

105
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,772
Boss! Could I have another bottle of pepper?

106
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:08,073
Okay.

107
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:17,573
You guys put in too much.

108
00:07:18,273 --> 00:07:20,273
Thank you very much!

109
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:27,272
The three who just left, are they together?

110
00:07:27,273 --> 00:07:30,672
No. All three of them are regulars,

111
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:33,972
but they just happened to come at the same time today.

112
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:35,272
What?

113
00:07:35,273 --> 00:07:38,772
Do you think that those three are suspicious after all?

114
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:40,372
Suspicious?

115
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:44,072
The other day, just about the time those three customers were here,

116
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:45,772
there was an incident,

117
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:49,072
and a lot of police officers came in here.

118
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:50,972
An incident?

119
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:52,772
It seems that a lady who lives in the neighborhood

120
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,772
was killed by a robber.

121
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:59,572
Oh, right. The one that the perp hasn't been arrested yet.

122
00:07:59,573 --> 00:08:02,872
So, are the three that just came suspects?

123
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:06,472
Yeah. The police officer said something of that sort.

124
00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:10,972
It seems that those three were taken to the police station, too.

125
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:12,272
Really?

126
00:08:12,273 --> 00:08:16,572
But if they've come here to eat ramen again, doesn't that mean...

127
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:19,672
That they're innocent, right?

128
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:22,872
But it seems that the police are still suspicious of them.

129
00:08:22,873 --> 00:08:27,072
A droopy eyed and slanted eye lady cop come here every day.

130
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,472
A droopy eyed and...

131
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:29,872
Slanted eye...

132
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:31,372
Lady cop...

133
00:08:31,373 --> 00:08:32,673
Don't tell me that...

134
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:37,672
So? Anything on the three?

135
00:08:37,673 --> 00:08:39,372
Well...

136
00:08:39,373 --> 00:08:41,672
Were they using more money than usual?

137
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:42,872
Or were they wearing expensive looking clothes,

138
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:44,372
had any bags or accessories on them?

139
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:46,872
That's what I'm asking you.

140
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:50,372
As to spending a lot of money, since this is a ramen shop,

141
00:08:50,373 --> 00:08:52,272
even if they went from ordering one ramen to two,

142
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:54,772
it wouldn't make much difference.

143
00:08:54,773 --> 00:08:56,272
How about the way they were dressed?

144
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:59,972
I don't think there were any changes.

145
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,772
Yumi and Naeko.

146
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:03,972
What? Ran.

147
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:05,773
Conan, you're here, too.

148
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:12,672
You chased the robber murderer into this shop?

149
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:14,272
Just the two of you?

150
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:15,372
Yes.

151
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:19,972
A week ago when we were patrolling this area,

152
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:23,273
we saw a suspicious character in front of that house.

153
00:09:24,873 --> 00:09:26,572
Hey, you over there!

154
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:28,373
What're you doing?

155
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:31,172
Hold it!

156
00:09:31,173 --> 00:09:32,972
I'll run after him,

157
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:36,572
so bring the car around to the other side of the street!

158
00:09:36,573 --> 00:09:38,072
And we'll flank them!

159
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:39,173
Yes, madam!

160
00:09:40,173 --> 00:09:43,872
So, I quickly went around with the car and waited.

161
00:09:43,873 --> 00:09:45,973
But only Yumi showed up.

162
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:49,972
It seems that they had a get together of all the shops that day

163
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:53,672
that almost all the lights of the shops were out, with no passersby.

164
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:56,172
And the only place open was

165
00:09:56,173 --> 00:10:00,073
this "Ogura Ramen Good Enough to Die For"!

166
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:04,972
And? The customers who were in the shop back then

167
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:07,172
were those three, right?

168
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,372
Yes.

169
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:11,872
Afterwards, we made those three stay in the shop.

170
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:14,272
Then we had Miwako and Takagi investigate the house

171
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:16,872
where we saw the suspicious character.

172
00:10:16,873 --> 00:10:20,072
The lady resident of that house

173
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:21,672
was found bleeding from her head,

174
00:10:21,673 --> 00:10:23,372
lying in the front entrance, dead.

175
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,672
Moreover, the glass window was cracked

176
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:29,172
and the house was messed up.

177
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:31,372
That lady was a hostess.

178
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:33,072
Judging from the fact that

179
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:37,472
she was killed when she went to get what she forgot at home.

180
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:41,972
The victim must've run into the burglar at the front door

181
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:43,872
and got into a struggle and was murdered.

182
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:45,072
We've figured out this much!

183
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:52,372
Then, isn't the last person who came rushing in here the perp?

184
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:53,672
The thing is

185
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:57,472
the three came at about the same time like they did today.

186
00:10:57,473 --> 00:11:01,172
From the time the three came in, to the time you two came in,

187
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:02,772
quite some time had gone by.

188
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:06,072
What? Didn't you run after the perp, Yumi?

189
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:10,873
Well, Yumi seems to have fell while she was chasing the perp.

190
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:16,072
You can be a scatterbrain sometimes.

191
00:11:16,073 --> 00:11:19,272
All I did was mistake sauce for shoyu, right?

192
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:22,172
When you get angry, your cute droopy eyes lose their attractiveness.

193
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:23,472
Excuse me.

194
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:24,972
Do you two...

195
00:11:24,973 --> 00:11:27,072
-Know each other? -Yeah.

196
00:11:27,073 --> 00:11:30,272
She used to come to the shop before we moved here,

197
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,772
with her boyfriend with the round glasses.

198
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:35,872
It's Haneda Meijin.

199
00:11:35,873 --> 00:11:39,072
He's my ex-boyfriend, my ex.

200
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,072
Is that so? You guys made a good pair.

201
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:44,472
Didn't you make up with him?

202
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:46,373
You guys were good together.

203
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:51,072
I could care less about him!

204
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:54,472
He always refuses my invitations saying that he's busy.

205
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:56,172
Well, having a 7 Crown title,

206
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,772
I'm sure he's busy with being interviewed by the media, magazines and such.

207
00:11:59,773 --> 00:12:01,672
But it's a mystery, don't you think?

208
00:12:01,673 --> 00:12:05,472
Why do men with round glasses seem to love ramen?

209
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:09,372
My big brother wears round glasses and loves ramen, too.

210
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:10,472
See?

211
00:12:10,473 --> 00:12:13,972
On top of that with stubble, it's 100 percent!

212
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:15,772
My big brother has stubble, too!

213
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:17,572
He's pretty good looking

214
00:12:17,573 --> 00:12:19,572
so if he cleans himself up and wears proper clothes,

215
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,272
I'm sure he'd be popular.

216
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,572
He usually only wears untidy jersey.

217
00:12:23,573 --> 00:12:24,573
That's right.

218
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:27,272
It's as if he's still studying trying to get into university or something.

219
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:29,172
He's smart though!

220
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:32,072
He has fantastic memory, too.

221
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:34,972
He remembers phone numbers in an instant.

222
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:36,172
He has a habit of saying,

223
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:39,172
"I'm number one in Japan for remembering things like this."

224
00:12:39,173 --> 00:12:42,172
"No, I'm the best in the world."

225
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:43,872
What?

226
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:46,472
Never mind stupid talk.

227
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:49,572
I fell because of the hose!

228
00:12:49,573 --> 00:12:50,772
Hose?

229
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:55,172
The perp threw it at me while I was chasing him!

230
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:57,772
A hose about 2 meters!

231
00:12:57,773 --> 00:13:00,472
Besides, I just tripped and fell.

232
00:13:00,473 --> 00:13:03,472
It's not that I was a scatterbrain, you know.

233
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:06,572
What kind of hose was it?

234
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:09,872
A pretty fat hose about 3 centimeters in diameter!

235
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:13,272
Maybe the victim used it to water her garden?

236
00:13:13,273 --> 00:13:15,072
Because it was gone.

237
00:13:15,073 --> 00:13:17,972
We thought it was the murder weapon at first.

238
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:20,172
What made you think it was the murder weapon?

239
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:24,372
The lady was bleeding from her head and died, right?

240
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:26,072
When we first saw the perp,

241
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:30,072
he was spinning the hose around

242
00:13:30,073 --> 00:13:33,072
in front of the front door of the victim's house with all his might!

243
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,572
There was a trace of masking tape

244
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:36,672
that was stuck to the tip of the hose.

245
00:13:36,673 --> 00:13:40,172
We thought that he stuck something on and struck her to death.

246
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:43,772
But there were no blood stains anywhere.

247
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:46,072
Spinning the hose...

248
00:13:46,073 --> 00:13:47,973
With all his might?

249
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:56,208
The perp was spinning the hose around?

250
00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:00,208
Was he really doing it in front of the house of the lady who was killed?

251
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:01,908
Yes, that's right.

252
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,908
In the dark, he was spinning it with all his might

253
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:07,508
to the point where you could hear a buzzing sound.

254
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:10,008
As if it were...

255
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:12,708
some kind of ritual!

256
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:14,608
Ritual?

257
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:15,808
How scary.

258
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:17,708
What else could it be?

259
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:20,508
Because that hose wasn't the murder weapon.

260
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:23,208
Doing something like that near the corpse,

261
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:24,608
what else could it be?

262
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:28,408
Then, why did that lady die?

263
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,108
She was knocked down,

264
00:14:30,109 --> 00:14:32,408
when she ran into the burglar at the front door

265
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,008
and got into a struggle with him.

266
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:37,308
And when she fell, it seems she probably hit the back of her head

267
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:41,108
against the corner of the stairs. That's what the coroner said.

268
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:43,508
But there was a trace of masking tape

269
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:46,708
being stuck on the tip of the hose, right?

270
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:50,208
If so, maybe the perp has something stuck to the tip of the hose

271
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:52,208
and spun it around threateningly...

272
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:55,608
Maybe the victim tried to avoid it and fell?

273
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:57,408
No way.

274
00:14:57,409 --> 00:15:00,808
That lady had her shoes on.

275
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:03,208
It's obvious that she ran into the burglar

276
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:06,008
before she entered her house.

277
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:09,509
He wouldn't have had time to make such a weapon!

278
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,608
Which means that

279
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:15,308
the perp had something stuck to the hose after the murder.

280
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:19,208
In other words, the perp rather than leave the spot,

281
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:23,808
prioritized putting something on the tip of the hose and spin it around.

282
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:26,609
Yes, I guess so.

283
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:30,708
A signal!

284
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:34,208
Maybe he was signaling the other burglars nearby by making a sound?

285
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:36,008
Telling them to get out of there!

286
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:37,508
What?

287
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:42,308
If he were going to put something on the hose to make a sound,

288
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:45,508
it would be faster to call on the cell phone!

289
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:49,208
If they had decided on such a signal,

290
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:52,808
they would've had something that would make a sound beforehand.

291
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:56,008
I don't think they would've used the hose of that house!

292
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:58,608
-Right. -Yeah.

293
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:02,908
But, how did you know that it was the hose of that house?

294
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:06,008
The faucet of the house

295
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:09,209
and the shape that was left on the hose matched!

296
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:14,308
If so, the perp was probably forced into

297
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:17,408
having to use the hose of that house.

298
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:21,608
But what would be more important than fleeing?

299
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:26,108
And? When you chased the perp into this ramen shop,

300
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:29,008
you checked the belongings of the three

301
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:31,508
who were here as customers, didn't you?

302
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:34,308
It seems that they were taken to the police, too.

303
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:35,408
Yes.

304
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:37,808
With Miwako, voluntarily.

305
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:40,608
If so, wasn't there anyone who had masking tape on them

306
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:43,608
among the three?

307
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:46,208
No. As to the masking tape,

308
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:50,108
the perp through it at me along with the hose.

309
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:54,608
Gosh. Why didn't you say so?

310
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:59,408
And? Do you know what the three had on them at that time?

311
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:01,108
What? Yes.

312
00:17:01,109 --> 00:17:04,308
I heard of it from Officer Takagi and I took notes of it.

313
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:08,008
The things that the hostess Ms. Yuna Shono had in her handbag are

314
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:10,908
a wallet, cigarettes, a lighter, a cell phone,

315
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:15,408
chewing gum, a handkerchief, tissue and her house key.

316
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,808
The freelancer Mr. Sosuke Mizushina...

317
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:20,508
A coin purse, a cell phone, a mask,

318
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:24,208
his house key and a glasses case, which he had in his chest pocket.

319
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,208
Company employee, Mr. Nakanishi...

320
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,208
A wallet, his house key, a cell phone, company documents

321
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:34,808
and a hand towel, which was in the pocket of his clothes and briefcase.

322
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:38,408
Nobody had anything valuable.

323
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:41,208
You checked inside this shop too, didn't you?

324
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:43,308
Yes, once through.

325
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:45,508
But we found nothing.

326
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:47,108
How about gloves?

327
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,808
If one of them among those three are burglars,

328
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:53,108
he should've had gloves or something?

329
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:54,508
As to that,

330
00:17:54,509 --> 00:18:00,808
the forensics found a pair of gloves in the sewer along the road,

331
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:05,908
but they were too contaminated to figure out who wore them.

332
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:07,808
And so it turned out that

333
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:11,008
they think that Miike and I let the perp get away.

334
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:14,008
So the three suspects were also sent home.

335
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,508
We're vexed,

336
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:18,608
that's why we're still investigating those three!

337
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:19,808
Does it bug you?

338
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:21,708
-Not at all. -Not at all.

339
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,908
But if the lady cops who are involved in this case

340
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:27,608
come here every day,

341
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:31,808
I wonder if the perp will go out of his way to come and eat ramen here?

342
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:35,308
If I'm the perp, I'd be too scared to come.

343
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:38,708
Then, are you saying that we were both just careless?

344
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:40,608
-No. -No.

345
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:43,608
We'd never say that. Right?

346
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:44,908
True.

347
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:46,708
Right.

348
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,808
I think that the hostess Ms. Shono is the one.

349
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:51,809
What?

350
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,908
Because the person who was killed was a hostess, wasn't she?

351
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:58,208
Maybe there some kind of a connection.

352
00:18:58,209 --> 00:19:00,408
Hey, Akiyo.

353
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:02,608
We've already checked on that!

354
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,608
The victim Ms. Atsuko Tonda and Ms. Shono

355
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:09,808
used to previously work for the shop as hostesses.

356
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:12,408
But after Ms. Shono changed shops last year,

357
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:14,608
it seems they haven't been having contact.

358
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:17,408
So, it seems there was not much of a connection.

359
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:20,608
But if they were working at the same club,

360
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:23,208
she would've known the commuting time, too.

361
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:25,508
It would be easy to burglarize the house, no?

362
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:28,708
That goes for Mr. Nakanishi, too!

363
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:33,108
Mr. Nakanishi was a regular at Ms. Tonda's club.

364
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:36,108
And used to call for her a lot,

365
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:38,109
so I think he's heard a lot of things from her.

366
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:42,308
And as to the time that Ms. Tonda leaves for work,

367
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:44,908
I think Mr. Mizushina would know about it, too.

368
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:47,308
The convenience store that he part-timed for

369
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:50,308
was right in front of Ms. Tonda's home, it seems.

370
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:54,508
Well, but that convenience store went out of business a few days

371
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:56,908
before the incident occurred, though.

372
00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:58,608
And? Are you sure

373
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:01,808
nothing about the three have changed after the incident?

374
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,308
I wonder.

375
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:05,608
Ms. Shono started using a lot of vinegar

376
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:08,308
saying that it was to maintain her beauty.

377
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:12,908
Mr. Mizushina started ordering only Tenshin.

378
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:18,209
Mr. Nakanishi started ordering two bowls of ramen instead of one.

379
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:22,108
They all seem irrelevant to the incident.

380
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:27,108
And, what did the burglar steal from Ms. Tonda?

381
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:29,808
We're not sure.

382
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:33,008
Although there were traces of the safe being forced open,

383
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:36,708
a load of cash was left inside it.

384
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:39,708
The drawer of the chest that the accessories were inside

385
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:41,908
were really messed up,

386
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:46,208
but a large number of accessories were still left behind.

387
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:48,508
Maybe it's pierced earrings?

388
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:50,209
Pierced earrings?

389
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:56,308
Ms. Tonda used to come here sometimes as a customer, too.

390
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:57,408
I don't remember when,

391
00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:01,608
but she came here super drunk and boasted in a loud voice.

392
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:04,809
Look, boss! My pierced earrings!

393
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:07,208
Those are amazing.

394
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:09,808
Is it a gift from your regular?

395
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,408
Yes, that's right!

396
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:14,108
Two ears together they total several million yen!

397
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:16,808
I always have them put away in the drawer.

398
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:20,908
But since today's my birthday, I decided to wear them!

399
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:23,208
Well, happy birthday then!

400
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:26,908
Well, for a hostess who isn't popular or who is disappointing,

401
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:30,008
or a guy who just comes to drink and gives no presents,

402
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:32,308
in other words, a good-for-nothing office worker

403
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:35,308
or for a creepy part-timer who works at a convenience store

404
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:37,708
watching me through the window,

405
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:40,008
no matter how hard they try,

406
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:42,309
they would never get a hold of this kind of treasure though!

407
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:45,908
That is what she said.

408
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:47,508
-That's it. -That's it.

409
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:51,408
Why didn't you tell that to the police, boss?

410
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:54,408
Because I just remembered!

411
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:57,008
Talk about remembering...

412
00:21:57,009 --> 00:21:59,808
On the day and time of the incident that day,

413
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:02,808
there was another person.

414
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:03,809
Another person...

415
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,408
Was here?

416
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:06,508
Huh?

417
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:08,309
What?

418
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:12,108
Shono, Mizushina, Nakanishi...

419
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:16,108
Who on earth his the other customer that was there besides the three?

420
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:17,409
Who on earth...

421
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:44,408
"Next Episode" -I mentioned a while ago too, didn't I?

422
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:48,408
Back then, Yumi and I flanked the perp that fled

423
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:51,008
along the street in front of this shop!

424
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:53,508
We cornered him into this shop!

425
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:54,908
Actually...

426
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:58,108
Not click-click, but click click...

427
00:23:58,109 --> 00:23:59,908
Each time he ran?

428
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:01,008
I see.

429
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:03,208
-Masumi? -Conan?

430
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:04,809
Hey.

431
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:12,209
Next Conan, "Ramen Good Enough to Die For: 2 (Part 2)"
