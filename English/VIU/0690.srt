1
00:00:08,711 --> 00:00:10,511
"Ten years ago"

2
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,811
What?

3
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:14,711
You want out of the case?

4
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:17,311
Are you saying that you want out of this case?

5
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:19,111
Yes, well, I guess so.

6
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:21,911
Let's not depend on a novelist like him

7
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:24,611
and nab the culprit, just by the hands of we, the police,

8
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:26,211
Assistant Inspector Megure!

9
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:29,811
The press is making a great fuss, after all over the word

10
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:32,811
"Death" that was written with the blood of the corpse.

11
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:36,311
They're saying that it may be the start of a bizarre series of murders!

12
00:00:36,311 --> 00:00:40,111
-Yeah... -No need for worry.

13
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:43,311
This is not a homicide.

14
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:46,411
But this word, "Death"...

15
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:48,411
I assure you.

16
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:53,811
Yusaku Kudo here will.

17
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:56,211
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

18
00:00:56,211 --> 00:00:58,211
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

19
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:00,011
The cold case of that father in question.

20
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:02,011
What is the mystery behind the case ten years ago?

21
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:03,711
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:05,811
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:08,611
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:54,884
"Yusaku Kudo's Cold Case (Part 1)"

25
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:09,484
You mean Shinichi Kudo's father

26
00:03:09,484 --> 00:03:12,884
is that famous mystery writer Yusaku Kudo?

27
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:15,084
Yep! It seems that he's away from Japan

28
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:17,384
and writing from somewhere abroad, though.

29
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:19,784
I used to read a lot of his novels when I was a child.

30
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:21,884
The Night Baron Series and the like.

31
00:03:21,884 --> 00:03:23,284
Well, but, thanks to him,

32
00:03:23,284 --> 00:03:27,184
that mystery loving freak son of his was born!

33
00:03:27,184 --> 00:03:28,984
But, how comforting to know that

34
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:31,284
your future husband's father is a best seller novelist!

35
00:03:31,284 --> 00:03:33,384
You're assured an easy life.

36
00:03:33,384 --> 00:03:34,684
Future husband?

37
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:38,384
By the way, about what you were saying a while ago, is it true?

38
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,384
Is it true that you know about the bizarre case,

39
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:43,684
the only one that Yusaku Kudo ever gave up on?

40
00:03:43,684 --> 00:03:47,384
Yes. Back when Shinichi's father was still in Japan,

41
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:50,484
he was cooperating on investigating the case.

42
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:52,984
But Shinichi was really angry that his father

43
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:55,384
had given up on that case half way through.

44
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:58,184
And, what kind of case was it?

45
00:03:58,184 --> 00:03:59,284
Well...

46
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:02,184
If I remember correctly, some kind of word

47
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:03,484
was written near the corpse.

48
00:04:03,484 --> 00:04:05,684
Hey! Are you all right?

49
00:04:06,884 --> 00:04:08,484
Hey, get a hold of yourself, Takaichi!

50
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:09,984
Mr. Takaichi?

51
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,584
Hey, Takaichi!

52
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:13,984
What's the matter?

53
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:15,184
Well, you see.

54
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:17,784
We were looking for him because he didn't show up at work.

55
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:19,884
Then we found him slumped down in a place like this.

56
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,784
He's bleeding from his mouth besides.

57
00:04:21,784 --> 00:04:24,784
We did call the ambulance to be safe.

58
00:04:26,484 --> 00:04:28,784
There's no need to call the ambulance.

59
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:31,984
Almost about nine hours

60
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:34,684
seems to have passed since he died already.

61
00:04:34,684 --> 00:04:36,684
What?

62
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:39,784
Does he have alcohol dependency?

63
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:41,784
Yeah. He used to say that

64
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:43,784
the doctor told him to stay away from alcoholic drinks.

65
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,984
But, how'd you know about it?

66
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:49,784
He's got jaundice on the white of his eye.

67
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:52,384
He's skinny but has a popped belly.

68
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:53,984
This is an abdominal build of fluids!

69
00:04:53,984 --> 00:04:56,084
It's proof that he's got a malfunctioning liver!

70
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:59,884
Furthermore, there is a bottle of sake left behind untouched

71
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:02,884
in the dispenser of the vending machine.

72
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:04,184
From the circumstances,

73
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:08,984
it's very likely that it's the bottle of sake that he bought!

74
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:11,084
If he were a patient suffering from a bad liver,

75
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:12,684
he would most naturally stay away from alcohol

76
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:14,484
that would worsen his symptoms.

77
00:05:14,484 --> 00:05:17,484
However, if he wanted alcohol despite his condition,

78
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,784
I just thought that he may have an alcohol dependency problem!

79
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:22,084
Wow.

80
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:25,284
So, well, an alcoholic

81
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,984
suffering from cirrhosis of the liver had a burst varix

82
00:05:26,984 --> 00:05:28,484
and spit blood.

83
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:30,884
And since unfortunately, there was no one around at that time,

84
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:34,084
he couldn't get help and died.

85
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,884
That's what you'd normally think.

86
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:39,784
But, this is not death by illness.

87
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:42,384
It's a crime committed by someone with malicious intent!

88
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,284
What?

89
00:05:44,284 --> 00:05:48,484
As proof of this, right in front of this man, see!

90
00:05:48,984 --> 00:05:51,384
There is the word "Death" written with blood.

91
00:05:52,784 --> 00:05:55,284
Hold it.

92
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:56,784
This word, "Death"!

93
00:05:56,784 --> 00:05:58,184
Looks just like the word that was found back

94
00:05:58,184 --> 00:05:59,384
at the scene of the crime ten years ago!

95
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:01,984
Don't tell me that!

96
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:04,484
It's the case that Shinichi's father gave up on

97
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:06,184
that was mentioned a while ago.

98
00:06:06,184 --> 00:06:09,884
Yep! Back then, Shinichi showed me the picture of the crime scene,

99
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:11,784
so there's no mistake about it!

100
00:06:13,084 --> 00:06:16,584
"Death"

101
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:37,284
Mail for Shinichi's cell phone?

102
00:06:37,284 --> 00:06:39,184
It's from Ran.

103
00:06:39,184 --> 00:06:43,184
I encountered a murder scene on my way to school today

104
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:45,684
and was surprised to find that the word written in blood

105
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:47,284
left behind at the scene

106
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:50,684
was exactly like the word you showed me ten years ago!

107
00:06:50,684 --> 00:06:53,484
Sera and Sonoko say that they want to see that photo too

108
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:56,884
so we're going over to your house after school to look for it.

109
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,284
I hope you don't mind.

110
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,784
Besides, I have an idea of where it may be.

111
00:07:00,784 --> 00:07:03,184
A word written in blood ten years ago.

112
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:06,384
Does she mean the case Dad ran out on?

113
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,984
I mean, wait a sec.

114
00:07:07,984 --> 00:07:10,884
To look for it? Don't tell me that Sera and Sonoko

115
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:12,584
are coming over to my house too?

116
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:17,184
Hey? Where's Conan?

117
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:18,884
Come to think of it, he's not around.

118
00:07:18,884 --> 00:07:21,584
How dare he slack off?

119
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:25,084
He said he had something urgent to do, so he had to leave early.

120
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:27,484
He said he'd make up for this one day.

121
00:07:27,484 --> 00:07:28,684
Make up for it?

122
00:07:28,684 --> 00:07:31,284
If he's making anything, I'd like eels over rice then!

123
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,584
He's making up for it.

124
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:40,384
Oh! It's a response from Shinichi.

125
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:42,484
I really don't feel comfortable

126
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:44,884
having people searching the house on their own,

127
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:47,284
so I told Conan where the picture is

128
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:48,984
and had him go to get it.

129
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:51,884
So, please settle for him taking it to the detective agency

130
00:07:51,884 --> 00:07:54,084
and showing it to you there, okay?

131
00:07:55,284 --> 00:07:58,184
Then, why don't you tell me where it is?

132
00:07:58,184 --> 00:07:59,284
I get it!

133
00:07:59,284 --> 00:08:03,384
Maybe he's got some lewd books near the picture, or something?

134
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:04,684
What?

135
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,484
But we already got here!

136
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:11,484
This is it, right? Shinichi Kudo's house.

137
00:08:11,484 --> 00:08:12,484
Yep.

138
00:08:14,384 --> 00:08:17,684
Why don't we go inside while we're at it?

139
00:08:19,484 --> 00:08:25,284
I'd like to meet Subaru, the guy who I heard lives here too!

140
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:27,884
Hello!

141
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:30,584
Conan's shoes.

142
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:32,284
You mean he's already here!

143
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:35,784
That brat sure is fast.

144
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:37,984
But, there's something about Subaru's

145
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,884
that's been bothering me from before!

146
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:41,684
Huh? What? What about?

147
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:43,084
Because you see,

148
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:46,484
he always wears clothes that hides his neck, doesn't he?

149
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,484
Huh? Is that so?

150
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:52,584
Yep, that's why maybe he's got an embarrassing tattoo

151
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:54,984
or something on his neck that he wants to hide!

152
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:57,284
Now that you mentioned it...

153
00:08:57,284 --> 00:09:00,584
So, I was thinking of pulling off his top

154
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:03,284
when I have the chance someday, what do you say?

155
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:04,584
What do I say?

156
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:09,684
Isn't it just that you want to see Subaru naked, Sonoko?

157
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:11,884
Well, that too.

158
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:15,084
Conan.

159
00:09:15,084 --> 00:09:16,884
So, that' s where you are!

160
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:32,584
Oh, Subaru!

161
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:36,584
I think Conan is here.

162
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:42,184
Oh, you mean he's in the study?

163
00:09:42,884 --> 00:09:46,084
Okay, we'll go over there then!

164
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:47,584
Sonoko!

165
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:52,984
He doesn't have a tattoo on his neck.

166
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:56,184
Let's go, Sera!

167
00:09:56,184 --> 00:09:58,984
Yeah. Okay.

168
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:24,193
Hey, Conan!

169
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:27,093
Do you want me to help you look for it?

170
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,293
I'm fine! I'm just about to find it already.

171
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:32,693
Why don't you drink black tea or something in the kitchen?

172
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:35,593
I'll take it to you when I find it!

173
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,793
Oh, okay.

174
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:39,093
I'll be waiting for you then! Let's go!

175
00:10:39,093 --> 00:10:41,893
Yeah. See you later then, Conan!

176
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:42,893
Yep.

177
00:10:46,293 --> 00:10:50,793
I tell you. After I mailed her telling her not to come.

178
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:54,793
Maybe Shinichi's hiding something after all.

179
00:10:54,793 --> 00:10:56,593
Hiding what?

180
00:10:56,593 --> 00:10:58,993
Lewd books.

181
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:00,693
No way.

182
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,893
Because although he let you clean the place

183
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:04,393
every month on your own,

184
00:11:04,393 --> 00:11:06,193
isn't it strange that he doesn't want you

185
00:11:06,193 --> 00:11:08,593
-to look for that certain picture? -But...

186
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:12,293
No, he may be hiding a woman.

187
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:13,893
A woman?

188
00:11:13,893 --> 00:11:15,393
Take a look at this.

189
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:17,193
A hair clip band.

190
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:20,693
It was on this shelf.

191
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,593
Women have a tendency to put things like these

192
00:11:22,593 --> 00:11:24,493
in places like this.

193
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:29,493
Oh, it's probably Shinichi's mother's! Right?

194
00:11:29,493 --> 00:11:32,593
Come to think of it, she usually used to tie her hair back.

195
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:35,193
But, among the dishes that aren't washed yet,

196
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:36,493
there is a glass cup where lipstick

197
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:40,293
seems to have been wiped off with the thumb.

198
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:44,693
And in the drain of the sink, there is a long strand of hair.

199
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:49,193
It looks to be hair from a wig, though.

200
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:51,293
Don't tell me that Shinichi's

201
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,793
flirting with some woman or something?

202
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:55,293
If you think so,

203
00:11:55,293 --> 00:11:56,993
why don't you take a picture of this and save it,

204
00:11:56,993 --> 00:11:59,093
and keep it in your diary!

205
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,993
If you write in when and where you found this evidence,

206
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:05,093
and how you felt at that time,

207
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:07,893
it would come in handy when you go to court.

208
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,793
Court?

209
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:12,293
Use a disposable instant camera rather than a digital camera

210
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:14,193
where the pictures can be processed in any way!

211
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:17,693
For the diary, use a ball point pen that cannot easily be revised,

212
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:20,293
and write in the news or weather of that day

213
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:22,193
to increase reliability!

214
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:24,393
The weather and news?

215
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:26,893
And you're saying that she'd be able to get

216
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:28,793
that smooth talking mystery freak by doing so, master?

217
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:30,593
Well, sort of. I guess.

218
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:35,093
Mr. Kudo hasn't been here for a while, has he?

219
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:36,593
Most naturally speaking,

220
00:12:36,593 --> 00:12:40,993
wouldn't that guy called Subaru that we saw awhile ago, his lady?

221
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,093
I guess so.

222
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:47,693
I brought you the picture. What're you talking about?

223
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:51,393
Never mind. You don't need to know about this, Conan!

224
00:12:51,393 --> 00:12:53,493
It's adult talk.

225
00:12:58,493 --> 00:13:00,593
Really, it sure looks alike!

226
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:02,493
This word "Death" written in blood.

227
00:13:02,493 --> 00:13:03,793
Then, don't tell me that

228
00:13:03,793 --> 00:13:07,393
the murderer from ten years ago appeared again?

229
00:13:07,393 --> 00:13:09,393
The serial killer?

230
00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:11,993
Yeah. I checked on the internet and found that

231
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:15,693
the word written in blood ten years ago wasn't publicized.

232
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:17,593
So I guess there's no mistake deeming that

233
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:20,293
the same culprit committed the crime!

234
00:13:20,293 --> 00:13:22,093
It's true that they both look alike, but...

235
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:25,793
Dad, back ten years ago...

236
00:13:27,193 --> 00:13:29,193
I assure you.

237
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:32,993
Yusaku Kudo here will.

238
00:13:34,593 --> 00:13:36,493
I'll assure you that this culprit who wrote and left behind

239
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:38,993
this word "Death",

240
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:42,393
will never ever appear again.

241
00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:51,393
What's going on?

242
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:55,093
I thought you said the culprit would never ever appear again?

243
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:56,393
Dad?

244
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,293
What? Really?

245
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:07,293
Did that Yusaku Kudo really say so?

246
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:08,793
Yep!

247
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:11,093
He said that the culprit who wrote the word "Death"

248
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:14,393
that was found near the corpse would never ever appear again.

249
00:14:14,393 --> 00:14:19,193
Shinichi said that he heard so from his father ten years ago!

250
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,893
I remember that Shinichi told me so

251
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:24,393
when he showed me the picture too!

252
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:28,393
Moreover, although there was blood on the man's palms and fingers,

253
00:14:28,393 --> 00:14:30,893
there was none on his fingertips,

254
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:33,893
so Shinichi was unconvinced, insisting that the dead man

255
00:14:33,893 --> 00:14:35,793
couldn't have written the words on his own,

256
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:39,193
and yet, why wasn't this deemed to be a homicide case.

257
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:45,493
Even if it wasn't murder, there's no mistake that

258
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:48,893
someone was near the corpse before the blood dried up.

259
00:14:48,893 --> 00:14:51,793
Besides, this morning we encountered a crime scene

260
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:57,493
where a word written in blood exactly like this one was found.

261
00:14:57,493 --> 00:14:59,293
But, if I remember correctly, that case

262
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:01,993
that happened ten years ago, wasn't it deemed as an accident?

263
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:03,793
Yep, that's right.

264
00:15:03,793 --> 00:15:04,993
Death by accident?

265
00:15:04,993 --> 00:15:06,993
The details seem to be written on this paper

266
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:10,093
that was inside together with this picture.

267
00:15:11,593 --> 00:15:13,493
Let's see.

268
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:15,793
The person who died was Mr. Takefumi Koriyama,

269
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:18,193
the principal of a nursery school,

270
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:21,793
and the cause of his death was shock from damage to his heart.

271
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:23,093
A shattered piece of glass from the fishbowl

272
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:26,093
that poked into his chest area pierced through his heart

273
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,693
and lead to his death.

274
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,993
He was scheduled to move the fish into

275
00:15:29,993 --> 00:15:33,093
a fishbowl temporarily in order to clean the fish tank but,

276
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:35,593
he forgot the fishbowl at his residence

277
00:15:35,593 --> 00:15:38,793
so went back to get it, and on his way back to the nursery,

278
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:42,293
he used a shortcut going through the park.

279
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:44,893
However, he unfortunately tripped over a stone on the cobbled road,

280
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:49,193
and fell, still holding the fishbowl in his hand and passed away.

281
00:15:49,193 --> 00:15:51,093
The one who first found the dead body

282
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:53,093
was a student at that nursery,

283
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:55,393
Ryosuke Nishimura, five years old.

284
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:58,293
The only son of a monk of a temple nearby.

285
00:15:58,293 --> 00:15:59,893
When the nursery school employees

286
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:03,193
were making a fuss over the principal not coming back,

287
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:05,193
they hear from this boy that he saw the principal

288
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:08,093
lying on the ground on his way to the nursery.

289
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,493
So, they run over to the park

290
00:16:09,493 --> 00:16:11,993
and found the principal's body there.

291
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:16,793
The boy back then was jittery and reticent

292
00:16:16,793 --> 00:16:19,493
but as soon as he began eating the candy that he had,

293
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:21,993
he finally started talking.

294
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:23,493
He talked about the fact that

295
00:16:23,493 --> 00:16:25,193
he was taking care of a puppy in the park

296
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,393
along with the other students,

297
00:16:26,393 --> 00:16:29,793
and that he checked on the dog on his way to the nursery.

298
00:16:29,793 --> 00:16:31,793
He went on to explain that he called out to the principal

299
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:34,993
but he didn't answer, so the boy thought that he was dead,

300
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:36,293
gathered some flowers from the park

301
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:37,793
and placed it by him as an offering.

302
00:16:37,793 --> 00:16:40,193
Oh, really,

303
00:16:40,193 --> 00:16:42,093
there are flowers in the picture.

304
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:44,093
Above the word written in blood.

305
00:16:44,093 --> 00:16:47,593
But, it looks more scattered, than like an offering, doesn't it?

306
00:16:47,593 --> 00:16:51,393
I'm sure the culprit who wrote this word scattered them around!

307
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:55,293
But, if that principal was murdered by someone,

308
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:57,093
the culprit would've had to push the principal

309
00:16:57,093 --> 00:17:00,593
who was holding the fishbowl from behind, give him a fatal blow

310
00:17:00,593 --> 00:17:01,993
and write the word using the blood

311
00:17:01,993 --> 00:17:05,093
that was bleeding from the principal...

312
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:07,693
but this boy who offered the flowers seems to have said that

313
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,893
there was no such word written in blood back then.

314
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:15,893
If so, right after the culprit attacked and killed the principal,

315
00:17:15,893 --> 00:17:17,593
he hid for a while without even attempting to flee,

316
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:19,593
despite the boy having come along.

317
00:17:19,593 --> 00:17:22,393
Then, waited for the boy to leave

318
00:17:22,393 --> 00:17:24,193
and approached the corpse once more,

319
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:27,693
leaving the word written in blood behind.

320
00:17:28,893 --> 00:17:32,093
Maybe it's that boy?

321
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,093
The one who wrote the word using the blood?

322
00:17:34,093 --> 00:17:35,093
What?

323
00:17:35,093 --> 00:17:37,693
I'm sure that he wrote it when he offered the flowers!

324
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:39,293
See, because he was the son of a monk,

325
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:41,393
maybe he did it to put the dead to rest.

326
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,393
But, he was only a boy of five years old, you know.

327
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:45,993
I don't think he knew how to write the kanji character "Death".

328
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:49,293
But this brat who is just about the same age

329
00:17:49,293 --> 00:17:51,093
seems to be able to write it though.

330
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:52,693
How was the man

331
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:55,893
who died that you and everyone else saw this morning?

332
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:57,393
Huh?

333
00:17:57,393 --> 00:17:58,793
It could serve as a hint to nab the culprit

334
00:17:58,793 --> 00:18:00,693
if you can find some similarities

335
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:03,493
with the case that occurred ten years ago.

336
00:18:03,493 --> 00:18:05,493
Similarities...

337
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:08,193
Nothing else except for that word written in blood.

338
00:18:08,193 --> 00:18:09,893
The thing that was found near the corpse

339
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:12,393
was not flowers but a cigarette.

340
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:16,593
I see! The thing that was in that picture was a cigarette.

341
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:17,793
Yep.

342
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:19,793
It was smeared with blood though.

343
00:18:19,793 --> 00:18:22,093
The estimated time of death of that man

344
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:25,293
was around 23:00 last night.

345
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:28,093
The corpse was leaning against the sake vending machine,

346
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:29,893
and in the dispenser of the machine,

347
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:32,693
a new bottle of sake was still inside.

348
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:37,093
Something happened to that man right after he bought the sake,

349
00:18:37,093 --> 00:18:40,493
and I think he was left there until daybreak.

350
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:44,593
You can only buy sake using a vending machine till 23:00, see!

351
00:18:44,593 --> 00:18:47,293
But, the word "Death" that was found near the man

352
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,993
was also written in blood, right?

353
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:53,593
Was that man poked by something too?

354
00:18:53,593 --> 00:18:55,893
He was bleeding from his mouth!

355
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:59,093
That man seems to have had an alcohol dependency problem, you see.

356
00:18:59,093 --> 00:19:03,793
So, I first thought that he died of bleeding from a burst varix.

357
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:05,793
That is, until I saw the word written in blood

358
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:08,993
from the opposite side of the corpse!

359
00:19:12,793 --> 00:19:16,093
In other words, the points in common of these two cases

360
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:19,293
are that the font of the word "Death" are almost exactly alike

361
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:23,693
and the other that both corpses do not look to have been murdered?

362
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:25,093
Yes...

363
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:27,593
And...

364
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:31,893
According to the newspaper clipping that was inside the envelope,

365
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:33,693
it's written that the nursery employee who rushed over to the park

366
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:35,593
found the word "Death" only after

367
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:39,493
he tried to lift the body and move it.

368
00:19:39,493 --> 00:19:41,693
This picture is probably one that was taken

369
00:19:41,693 --> 00:19:43,793
after the corpse was moved a bit,

370
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:47,193
and when that boy found the corpse, the word written in blood

371
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:48,993
was already there

372
00:19:48,993 --> 00:19:52,993
but was hidden out of sight by the body.

373
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:54,893
Oh, I'm sorry...

374
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,493
for butting in on you.

375
00:19:56,493 --> 00:20:02,193
Subaru is a Holmes fan and loves to make deductions!

376
00:20:03,793 --> 00:20:06,793
Come to think of it, this morning, we saw the colleague

377
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:09,693
shaking the body of the man who died, right?

378
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:13,593
Yep. Maybe that corpse was moved a bit too.

379
00:20:13,593 --> 00:20:17,393
If so, why not ask the police about it?

380
00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:20,193
Officer Takagi was the one who came

381
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:22,393
when you called the police, right, Ran?

382
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:25,093
Maybe he'll tell you something.

383
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,693
Oh, you mean the corpse that was found this morning?

384
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,093
I'm sure it was a man called Mr. Isao Takaichi

385
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:32,693
that lives near the site.

386
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:36,493
I don't know what happened to the corpse after that though.

387
00:20:36,493 --> 00:20:38,493
It was concluded to be a robbery case,

388
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:41,093
and was passed over to the investigation 3rd division.

389
00:20:41,093 --> 00:20:45,293
Robbery? It wasn't a homicide?

390
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:49,993
Hey, cut out the joke! What about that case is a robbery?

391
00:20:49,993 --> 00:20:52,793
You are...

392
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,593
I'm Sera, the one who was with Ran at the scene of the crime!

393
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:56,893
Oh.

394
00:20:56,893 --> 00:20:59,293
That high school girl detective.

395
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:01,993
You saw too, didn't you? That word "Death" written in blood?

396
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:04,493
Well, I thought the same thing too.

397
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:07,293
That this was a bizarre homicide case.

398
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:09,893
But, Inspector Megure who came along

399
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,293
after you all left for school,

400
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:14,093
saw that word written in blood

401
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:16,793
and immediately said, 'this is probably a robbery'.

402
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:20,393
In fact, no wallet was found on the corpse.

403
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:22,493
But, he did buy the beer, didn't he?

404
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:23,793
If he lived close by,

405
00:21:23,793 --> 00:21:26,693
he could've just had enough money on him to buy the beer!

406
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:30,293
Yeah. I thought so too, but...

407
00:21:30,293 --> 00:21:33,793
Oh, by the way, just like you had said,

408
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,993
he seems to have died of a burst varix due to cirrhosis.

409
00:21:36,993 --> 00:21:39,493
Hey, Officer Takagi! Let's go get info!

410
00:21:39,493 --> 00:21:40,693
Oh, yes, sir!

411
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:42,793
So, I've got to go, sorry.

412
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:45,193
Oh, hey?

413
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:47,393
I'm not finished yet!

414
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:48,393
Hey!

415
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:52,593
Darn.

416
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:57,793
It's not a homicide but a robbery.

417
00:23:21,093 --> 00:23:22,893
It's strange, isn't it?

418
00:23:22,893 --> 00:23:24,593
I'm sure that Inspector Megure

419
00:23:24,593 --> 00:23:27,093
was also in charge of the case that occurred ten years ago.

420
00:23:27,093 --> 00:23:28,593
It's only natural that he would consider it

421
00:23:28,593 --> 00:23:30,593
to be a case of serial murder, and yet...

422
00:23:30,593 --> 00:23:32,193
That's true.

423
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:35,893
Ten years ago, Inspector Megure is sure to have seen

424
00:23:35,893 --> 00:23:37,993
that word written in blood too.

425
00:23:37,993 --> 00:23:40,793
And yet... why?

426
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:43,893
Besides, back then, Dad was talking with the boy

427
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:45,793
who first found the corpse.

428
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:47,393
Moreover, he was smiling too.

429
00:23:49,293 --> 00:23:50,993
I wonder why.

430
00:23:50,993 --> 00:23:54,893
I wonder why Dad declared that it was not homicide.

431
00:23:56,193 --> 00:23:57,393
Why?

432
00:23:59,893 --> 00:24:01,993
If you're going to ask for advice on the case,

433
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:04,393
it'll have to be Shinichi Kudo, right?

434
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:06,893
Subaru was saying!

435
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:12,693
That Shinichi is just like a ninja. Saizo Kirigakure!

436
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:13,893
Sanada!

437
00:24:13,893 --> 00:24:15,693
He says that he found out the truth of the case,

438
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:17,993
so to head for the scene of the crime right away.

439
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:21,093
I guess we gotta go to determine

440
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:24,093
whether his deduction is right or wrong.

441
00:24:24,093 --> 00:24:29,693

Next Conan's Hint:

"Loose Change"

444
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:51,793
Are you more concerned about him flirting than the case itself?

445
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:53,393
In order to win the case.

446
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:55,293
Hey, hey!
