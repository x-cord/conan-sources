1
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,730
Ms. Mejiro.

2
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,330
Hello, we came to look at the farm.

3
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,430
Ran, you're early.

4
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,930
This is fantastic.

5
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,830
It's full of autumn vegetables.

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,430
Despite it being a week day, you're working hard in the fields.

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,530
"Misa Mejiro (45), clerk" -If it's watering the field and harvesting,

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,630
they can be done after work, you see.

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,430
It's convenient since it's nearby, isn't it?

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,030
Yes!

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,530
Oh boy. Who pulled off the insect repellent net?

12
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,630
"Shinichiro Taguchi (51), office worker" -After all the trouble

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,630
I went through to make it for my vegetables.

14
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,530
You're the one who did it, aren't you?

15
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,030
Beats me.

16
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,430
"Takehiko Nakamura (73), unemployed" -Although now,

17
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,730
my lot can get a lot of sunshine.

18
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,830
Only if Gramps Troublemaker weren't here, this place is super...

19
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,530
Don't throw the weeds that you pulled out onto my lot!

20
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,030
Beats me.

21
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,530
"Marie Inoue (26)" -How many times do I have to tell you?

22
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,730
Will you please cut it out?

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,330
Lay off! I told you I know nothing of it!

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,430
There was a time when my lot was soaked in water, you know.

25
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,430
What a troublemaker, the old man!

26
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,930
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,030
You had to see all this unpleasantness after coming here.

28
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,930
Hey, won't you come help pick the vegetables next time?

29
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,530
I'll share some of my organic vegetables with you, too.

30
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,030
Eating vegetables eaten by insects all over like that

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,930
won't taste good at all.

32
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,330
What's with this farm?

33
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,830
Brooding over passing seasons

34
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,630
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

35
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,630
A murder is committed on the roof far!

36
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,830
Today, scarecrow Kogoro makes his appearance!

37
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,530
He sees through the one and only truth.

38
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,330
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

39
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,430
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

40
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:47,479
"Trap of the Roof Farm"

41
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:52,179
Dad's really all for it.

42
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:56,779
I'm going to make French fries with the potatoes I pick from the garden

43
00:03:56,779 --> 00:04:00,279
and eat them as snacks with beer!

44
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:02,879
Don't go making holes in the roof.

45
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:12,579
That's...

46
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:17,379
The old man we saw the other day?

47
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:27,679
No good.

48
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,179
A wound on his forehead, too?

49
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:40,179
The victim is Mr. Takehiko Nakamura, 73 years old.

50
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,679
He's an elderly man who lives in the neighborhood.

51
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:44,579
The estimated time of death

52
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:46,679
seems to be around 10:00 in the morning.

53
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:49,579
When you came to this roof farm,

54
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:52,279
you found Mr. Nakamura lying on the ground?

55
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:55,379
Yes, we found him about 11:00!

56
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,979
By the way, why are you dressed like that?

57
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,179
I've come with my daughter to help

58
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:03,979
a person called Ms. Mejiro to pick vegetables!

59
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:09,179
Oh, well. Does Mr. Nakamura rent a lot here?

60
00:05:09,179 --> 00:05:13,579
Yes. He seems to have been a habitual troublemaker,

61
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,279
and was called "Gramps Troublemaker"

62
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,779
by the others who rent lots here.

63
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,479
I see.

64
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:23,679
We'll have to check either way if we've got a case here or not.

65
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,679
The cause of death seems to be that

66
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,679
he hit the back of his head really hard.

67
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,179
He must've hit his head on the water container

68
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:32,279
that was in the field.

69
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,979
So he fell on his back.

70
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,279
There are traces that look like he slipped.

71
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:42,379
Why does he also have a wound on his forehead?

72
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,279
It's still new.

73
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,379
I wonder if he hit it some place?

74
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,079
Maybe he tried to wash his hands

75
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,379
and hit his forehead on the faucet.

76
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:52,879
He then was surprised, lurched backwards,

77
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,379
slipped and fell on his back.

78
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:56,979
What do you think?

79
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:01,479
That's why the towel was on the ground behind the faucet.

80
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:03,479
What's that dirty part?

81
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,479
I had the forensics check it and found that

82
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,079
it was the same substance as what's on the railing of the fence.

83
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,579
He probably hung it on the railing.

84
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,579
Why does he have two towels?

85
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:17,479
A cell phone was found near the body.

86
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,779
Check to see if it really belongs to Mr. Nakamura, will you?

87
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:21,779
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:23,879
Is there any other way in and out of here

89
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,579
besides that elevator?

90
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:28,679
The stairs of the emergency exit is under construction now.

91
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:32,379
So, there seems to be no stairs available to make access here.

92
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:36,379
Which means that, the only access here is by using that elevator.

93
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:38,779
There seems to be no buildings higher

94
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,579
than this one in the surroundings.

95
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:44,579
This building... the windows are all barred.

96
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,679
So, there's no way that anyone could climb out the window

97
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:50,079
and go up to the roof.

98
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,579
Check the images on the surveillance camera of the elevator

99
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,179
and see if anyone went in to or out of the roof!

100
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:56,579
Yes, sir!

101
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:59,379
I guess we should go talk to the people involved of this farm

102
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:00,879
to see if we've got a case here.

103
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,079
Yes, sir!

104
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,879
Takagi! Go gathered the people involved!

105
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,179
Yes, sir!

106
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:12,479
But this dead body sure is in a strange position.

107
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,779
What is it?

108
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:16,179
His position...

109
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,179
Don't... Don't tell me that...

110
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:22,579
What is it, Mouri?

111
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:24,479
Inspector! This dead body!

112
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,979
Doesn't it look like he's pointing his index finger at his own face?

113
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,179
I guess you could say that.

114
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:33,979
But, if you slip and fall,

115
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:36,779
there's a chance that you may end up this way, isn't there?

116
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:39,479
Ran!

117
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,279
Who are the other people that we met the other day on this farm

118
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,879
that are renting land besides Ms. Mejiro?

119
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,279
Uh...

120
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,679
Office worker, Mr. Taguchi,

121
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:51,479
office lady, Ms. Inoue... I think it was.

122
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,979
Inspector, there are people whose name have the kanji character

123
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:56,079
representing part of a face in their name!

124
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,979
Ms. Mejiro = Eye!

125
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:00,079
Mr. Taguchi = Mouth!

126
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,679
Maybe Mr. Nakamura was trying to tell us

127
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,679
who the one who murdered him is

128
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:05,879
by pointing to that part of his face!

129
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,379
Are you serious?

130
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:11,279
But it's difficult to determine

131
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,979
which part of his face he is pointing at.

132
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:15,679
Was it the eyes or the mouth?

133
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:21,579
The police wants to talk.

134
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:23,179
What on earth about?

135
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:27,379
Mr. Nakamura was found dead on the roof farm this morning.

136
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,879
What? Gramps Troublemaker?

137
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,579
So, our farm will find some peace from now.

138
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,279
I feel like my heart has suddenly gotten light.

139
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,679
Are you sure it's them, these three people?

140
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,079
Yes, sir. When I came to the farm the other day,

141
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:46,379
I heard that those people were being troubled by Mr. Nakamura.

142
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,079
He soaked Ms. Mejiro's lot in water.

143
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:52,179
Mr. Taguchi's insect repellent net was broken by him.

144
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:53,179
Ms. Inoue said that

145
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:55,879
he had disposed of the weeds he pulled out on her lot.

146
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:59,679
I'm sure that they had other things done to them, too.

147
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,779
So, all of the things he did accumulated hate after hate in them

148
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:03,179
and they finally...

149
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:05,979
Hey, you mean that old man was killed?

150
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,479
Don't tell me you think we did it?

151
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,579
Come, come...

152
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:12,679
We haven't concluded it's a murder yet.

153
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,779
We just want to hear what you have to say,

154
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:16,179
so would like to ask you to cooperate with us voluntarily.

155
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:20,279
Please tell me what you three were doing and where you were

156
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:25,279
around the estimated time of death of the victim.

157
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,379
Okay. Ms. Mejiro, I believe your lot was diagonally across

158
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:33,479
from Mr. Nakamura's, shall we start with you then?

159
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:37,979
I work at the office here on the first floor of this building.

160
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:40,679
Since I couldn't finish my accounting work yesterday,

161
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,479
I worked on my day off and came in about 08:30.

162
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:47,079
Where were you at 10:00?

163
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:48,779
Since Ran and the others were coming here

164
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,779
to help me pick vegetable around 11:00,

165
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,179
I was working in the office till then.

166
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,579
Is there anyone who can prove that for you?

167
00:09:57,579 --> 00:09:59,079
Since it's Saturday today,

168
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:02,279
there's nobody else in the office but me.

169
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,879
Since Ms Mejiro works in this building,

170
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,679
so she can come up here right away.

171
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,479
Maybe the finger of the dead body was pointing at his "eye".

172
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,279
Then, the officer worker that has a lot next to Mr. Nakamura's,

173
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:19,279
Mr. Taguchi, how about you?

174
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,879
I went to the home center in the morning

175
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:24,079
to buy some fertilizer and stuff.

176
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,379
The fact is, I was going to come to the farm from afternoon anyway.

177
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:29,579
Is there anybody who can prove that for you?

178
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:34,979
If the salesclerk at the home center remembers me...

179
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,979
Right! I've got the receipt!

180
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:41,779
Here it is!

181
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,479
A receipt that indicates 11:00 doesn't serve a proof.

182
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:51,479
Oh, no...

183
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:54,679
Maybe his dying message was him pointing at his "mouth".

184
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:59,879
Then, how about you, office worker Ms. Inoue,

185
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,279
whose lot is next to Mr. Nakamura's?

186
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,279
Since I'm off work today, I got up late.

187
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,779
And, how about around 10:00?

188
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:10,479
I wonder...

189
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:14,279
I think I was groggily watching TV after I got up.

190
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,579
I have nobody who can prove that since I live alone.

191
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:22,279
Ms. Inoue lives right below the roof,

192
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:26,679
but there's nothing in her name that represents the part of a face.

193
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:30,179
There's no one here that has a definite alibi.

194
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:33,079
You'll have to come with me to the site,

195
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:35,479
so I can ask you further questions.

196
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:40,279
Gramps Troublemaker troubles people even after he dies!

197
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,079
Be it an accident or murder,

198
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,979
there's no mistake that he brought it upon himself.

199
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:48,079
He goes and bumps his head on his own and dies.

200
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,879
Then he gets us all messed up in this.

201
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,679
What a bummer.

202
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,741
Yes.

203
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:10,241
I see. I understand.

204
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:11,441
Inspector.

205
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:15,041
That cell phone was Mr. Nakamura's cell phone after all.

206
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,241
At around 10:00 in the morning,

207
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:19,241
he received a call from a non-displayed number.

208
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:22,141
It seems to have been dialed from a pre-paid cell phone.

209
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,041
We haven't figured out who the caller was.

210
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,641
-Check on it just to be sure! -Yes, sir.

211
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:30,541
What shall we do with the three people?

212
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,041
There seems to be no change in their attitude or testimony

213
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,141
even after seeing the site.

214
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:36,641
Inspector!

215
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:41,541
I've confirmed the images in the surveillance camera of the elevator.

216
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,641
Mr. Nakamura went up to the roof with the elevator at 09:00.

217
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:46,341
Then, until Mr. Mouri and his party

218
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:47,841
went up the elevator to the roof at 11:00,

219
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:51,041
no one else did.

220
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:55,541
So, no one other than Mr. Nakamura went up to the roof.

221
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,141
There seems to be nothing suspicious.

222
00:12:58,141 --> 00:12:59,541
In other words,

223
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:03,241
this is an accident that frequently occurs to the aged.

224
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,041
After finishing his farming work,

225
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,441
he caner to the faucet to wash his hands.

226
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:09,041
Then, his cell phone rang,

227
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,041
so he got distracted and slipped

228
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,741
and hit the back of his head on the corner of the water container.

229
00:13:14,741 --> 00:13:16,641
This seems to be what happened.

230
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:17,941
You mentioned earlier that

231
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:19,141
the strange position that the dead body was found,

232
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:21,541
it may have some meaning though?

233
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:25,541
Oh, no, well, I just meant that it could be a possibility.

234
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:29,041
When he slipped and fell,

235
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,841
he twisted his body in surprise.

236
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:33,341
How about the wound on his forehead?

237
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:34,841
It could be that the cell phone

238
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:38,441
that he was holding hit his forehead when he fell!

239
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:41,741
Okay. Let's conclude the case as an accident.

240
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,641
Something bothers me.

241
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:48,541
There are two suspicious points.

242
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,341
The wound on Mr. Nakamura's forehead,

243
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:53,241
and why is it that he had a towel around his neck

244
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:56,141
and yet, another towel was found on the ground.

245
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,941
Ran! If you touch anything at the scene,

246
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,041
the officer will get angry at you!

247
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:07,041
The prop was down, so I inadvertently...

248
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:12,141
This is...

249
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:22,641
I see. So, that's the story!

250
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:25,141
So, now we get to go.

251
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:26,141
If it's an accident,

252
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:28,141
they should just tell us it is from the beginning.

253
00:14:28,141 --> 00:14:30,541
My day off's been totally wasted.

254
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:35,041
I'm counting on you, Pops.

255
00:14:42,741 --> 00:14:44,441
Wait...

256
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:45,641
Oh, no!

257
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:47,841
Inspector!

258
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:53,541
There's a person among the three who killed Mr. Nakamura,

259
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,341
and is deceiving the police by making it look like an accidental death!

260
00:14:56,341 --> 00:14:57,741
-What? -What?

261
00:14:57,741 --> 00:14:59,441
What're you talking about?

262
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,141
You yourself said a while ago,

263
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:03,641
that this was a case of accidental death, didn't you?

264
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:07,841
That was a lie to catch the killer off guard.

265
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:11,641
Will you please gather the suspects here?

266
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:14,541
Are you planning to make your deduction like that?

267
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,041
Who cares about how I'm dressed.

268
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,341
What's important is the truth of the matter!

269
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:22,841
Goodness. What on earth's going on?

270
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:24,741
Geez.

271
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:27,141
The one who killed Mr. Nakamura

272
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:31,241
used a certain trick to make it look like an accident.

273
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:33,241
-What? -Trick?

274
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:35,241
Hey, hey. Are you serious?

275
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:37,541
You're still going on?

276
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,541
I figured out that it was a trick

277
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,041
at seeing the wound on Mr. Nakamura's forehead.

278
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,941
He wouldn't have that wound if he actually did slip at the place

279
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:47,341
where the faucet was and fell on his back.

280
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:50,241
Something came flying and hit him on the forehead!

281
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,741
But, hasn't it already been confirmed

282
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:54,541
that there are no other buildings nearby

283
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,941
where something can be thrown from?

284
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:58,941
Yes, that's why we were all deceived.

285
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:00,941
Our boy found something interesting

286
00:16:00,941 --> 00:16:02,741
among the Chinese cabbage field.

287
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:05,141
Hey, Conan!

288
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:06,341
Here it is.

289
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,041
I gathered it and put it together

290
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,341
and it became one block of brick.

291
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:13,341
This is...

292
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:15,741
There's a hole in the middle.

293
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,741
The pieces of the brick were scattered

294
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:22,441
near the borders of Mr. Nakamura and Ms. Inoue's field.

295
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:23,741
That came flying

296
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:26,441
and wounded Mr. Nakamura on the forehead.

297
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:31,041
It probably shattered because it hit the paving stone.

298
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,641
Came flying... from where?

299
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:36,941
The brick came flying

300
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:38,941
not from the side but from below.

301
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:40,841
From below?

302
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:42,441
The towel was on the ground

303
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:44,341
between the faucet and the fence, wasn't it?

304
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:46,441
I thought it was strange.

305
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:49,241
Despite Mr. Nakamura having a towel wrapped around his neck,

306
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,141
the fact that there was another towel at the site bothered me.

307
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:53,341
Come to think of it,

308
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:56,741
the old man had his initials embroidered on his towel.

309
00:16:56,741 --> 00:16:58,841
There's none on that one.

310
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:01,341
Inspector, you remember that the paint from the railing

311
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:05,041
was stuck on the back of the towel, don't you?

312
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,141
Yeah, I heard the report.

313
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:09,941
But, what about it?

314
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:11,541
The remains of the paint

315
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,441
looked as if it had been scraped on strongly.

316
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:16,841
The towel was hung on the railing of the fence

317
00:17:16,841 --> 00:17:19,041
and scraped along strongly against something

318
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,141
then eventually fell where it was found.

319
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,941
Just what do you mean?

320
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:27,341
The killer pulled a rope through the brick

321
00:17:27,341 --> 00:17:30,241
which had a hole made in it

322
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:32,441
and the towel that was hung on the railing of the fence of the roof,

323
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:34,441
was probably sandwiched between the railing and the rope.

324
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:37,941
And, when Mr. Nakamura came in front of the railing,

325
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:40,541
the rope was pulled strongly from the floor below!

326
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:47,641
Mr. Nakamura then slipped,

327
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:49,441
and bumped his head on the water container

328
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:52,341
that was left there beforehand.

329
00:17:52,341 --> 00:17:55,141
The brick that came flying hit the paving stone shattered

330
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,141
and fell into the field.

331
00:17:57,141 --> 00:18:00,741
The killer pulled the rope and retrieved it,

332
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:04,341
but the towel was still left back at the scene of the crime.

333
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:05,941
She sandwiched the towel

334
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:08,441
in order to block Mr. Nakamura's vision

335
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:11,941
so that he wouldn't see the brick that was hanging.

336
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:15,341
In other words, the person who killed Mr. Nakamura...

337
00:18:20,841 --> 00:18:23,241
is you, Ms. Inoue!

338
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:25,541
-What the? -What's this?

339
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,641
What?

340
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:30,141
Me? Why would I?

341
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:31,841
I see.

342
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:33,241
The only one who could've carried out this trick

343
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:35,941
is Ms. Inoue who lived right below!

344
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:38,541
The faucet is right below the window.

345
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:42,441
Besides, Mr. Nakamura left a dying message behind.

346
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:43,741
What?

347
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:46,141
After hitting her head on the faucet,

348
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:49,241
Mr. Nakamura realized that you had done this,

349
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:52,241
so he left a message behind pointing you out as the killer.

350
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:54,041
There's no part representing a part of the face

351
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,641
in the Kanji character of Ms. Inoue's name though?

352
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:58,341
No.

353
00:18:58,341 --> 00:19:01,841
Mr. Nakamura's finger wasn't pointing at anything on his face,

354
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,941
but rather at the floor below.

355
00:19:03,941 --> 00:19:07,941
In other words, it was a dying message saying that

356
00:19:07,941 --> 00:19:10,041
Ms. Inoue who lived right below killed him.

357
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,841
I understand that by doing what you just explained,

358
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:17,241
it's possible to wound Mr. Nakamura's forehead and make him fall,

359
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:21,941
but how did she lure Mr. Nakamura over to the railing?

360
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:23,341
Right.

361
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:25,841
Are you saying that I shouted out loud or something?

362
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:29,141
If I do that, the neighbors would suspect me!

363
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:30,841
It's simple.

364
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:34,441
You used a prepaid cell phone.

365
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:38,941
After confirming that only Mr. Nakamura was on the roof,

366
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:42,141
you lured Mr. Nakamura over to the place where the towel was

367
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:44,341
by giving him whatever reason

368
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:46,441
and pulled the rope from below!

369
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:50,141
That only deduces that I was the only one

370
00:19:50,141 --> 00:19:52,241
who could've used that trick, doesn't it?

371
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:53,441
The dying message sounds like

372
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:55,041
something you just put together for the heck of it.

373
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,941
Or, do you have any proof?

374
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:58,541
Concrete proof.

375
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,741
Before coming up to the roof, you said...

376
00:20:02,741 --> 00:20:05,841
He goes and bumps his head on his own and dies.

377
00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:07,641
Then he gets us all messed up in this.

378
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:09,541
What a bummer.

379
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,441
Back then, the police had not explained anything

380
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:15,641
as to Mr. Nakamura's cause of death yet?

381
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:20,041
The only person who could've made that remark

382
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,241
is the killer, Ms. Inoue!

383
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,141
Officer Chiba.

384
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,541
Was Ms. Inoue shown on the surveillance camera

385
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,841
of the elevator after 10:00?

386
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:35,741
No, not even once.

387
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:38,841
Which means that Ms. Inoue had not left her room since.

388
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:42,541
If so, it should still be in her room,

389
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,741
the rope that she used to kill Mr. Nakamura!

390
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:48,141
-Officer Takagi. -Yes, sir.

391
00:20:48,141 --> 00:20:51,041
You don't mind us checking your room, do you?

392
00:20:54,741 --> 00:20:57,541
You don't have to go out of your way to check.

393
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,041
Just as the detective said,

394
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,541
it's in my room

395
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,541
because I didn't have time to get rid of it.

396
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,341
Yes, I did it.

397
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:10,141
I killed that hateful troublemaker old man!

398
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:12,341
Oh, no. What a thing to do,

399
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:14,441
even if he did cause a lot of trouble to the people around him.

400
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,041
Trouble?

401
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,041
He did way more than cause trouble!

402
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,041
The vegetables that I gave all my love and care to

403
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,141
in raising over so many months

404
00:21:22,141 --> 00:21:25,441
was all killed because of his insecticide!

405
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:27,241
That old fart...

406
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:30,241
Oh, so these were vegetables.

407
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:32,641
I thought they were weeds since they looked so flimsy,

408
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:35,141
so I poured insecticide on them.

409
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:39,141
They were vegetables that I raised from the seeds

410
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:43,041
that my father who died of an illness left behind for me!

411
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:48,041
I couldn't forgive him for insulting my vegetables that way!

412
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:22,141
Ms. Inoue seems to have been living with her father

413
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:26,341
who was a farmer from the time she was a child, just the two of them.

414
00:23:26,341 --> 00:23:29,041
So, when her father died of an illness,

415
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,041
the only thing that kept her going on living

416
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:33,841
were probably raising vegetables.

417
00:23:36,141 --> 00:23:37,341
Huh?

418
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:39,541
I can't shake the feeling of having forgotten something.

419
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:52,641
Pops, play your role as Scarecrow Kogoro for a while longer.

420
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,841
"Next Episode" -A 50,000 yen necklace?

421
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:59,641
It could be a birthday present for somebody.

422
00:23:59,641 --> 00:24:02,641
I won a ticket for an overnight stay at a hotel?

423
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:07,041
Huh? Mom, you aren't wearing anything around your neck.

424
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:10,241
Then, she can go wear a dog collar or something!

425
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,341
This old guy...

426
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:13,541
Is he even planning to give her a present?

427
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:27,041
