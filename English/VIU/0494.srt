1
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:03,133
In order to confirm whether Rena Mizunashi and Eisuke's older sister

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:05,533
are one and the same person,

3
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,433
we go and visit the Okudaira residence

4
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:10,133
where his mother used to work as a housekeeper.

5
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,633
We get hold of Eisuke's mother's belongings,

6
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:13,133
including a mother-child booklet.

7
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,833
From these things and Mrs. Okudaira,

8
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,433
we find out that Rena and Eisuke's older sister

9
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:19,433
are two different people.

10
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:21,533
In the meantime, at the Okudaira residence,

11
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:23,233
a year ago, the oldest son of this family, Tango

12
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:25,733
had been killed by someone

13
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,433
and a year later today,

14
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:30,933
the head of this household, Kakuzo is also found dead.

15
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:33,633
At his feet, a blood smeared book with the title,

16
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,833
"Murderer from the Land of the Dead" is found.

17
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:41,933
At any rate, if this is a dying message,

18
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:48,933
your husband Kakuzo

19
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:55,133
had to have been killed by one of you in this house.

20
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:15,833
Sizzling hot suspense.

21
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:18,333
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

22
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,233
The case is finally solved!

23
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:22,533
Who is the murderer from the Land of the Dead?

24
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:23,833
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,533
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:27,733
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:59,175
"Red and Black Crash: Hades"

28
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,556
I guess I'll start by asking you some questions!

29
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:04,756
Before he was found,

30
00:03:04,756 --> 00:03:08,256
where was your husband and what was he doing?

31
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:09,956
Oh, yes.

32
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,956
I showed Detective Mouri to the living room,

33
00:03:12,956 --> 00:03:14,556
and after that...

34
00:03:14,556 --> 00:03:18,256
I was planning to show him the pool but,

35
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:21,156
it started to rain

36
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:24,056
so I left that up to Kikuyo

37
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:26,156
who just happened to come back from shopping,

38
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:29,456
and went to serve my husband his coffee.

39
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:30,956
Where did you go shopping?

40
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:33,556
I went to the supermarket in the neighborhood

41
00:03:33,556 --> 00:03:35,956
to get some cream to put inside Mr. Okudaira's coffee.

42
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:40,656
Oh, I have the the receipt I received too.

43
00:03:40,656 --> 00:03:42,756
See.

44
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,356
I see.

45
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:48,256
And, how was Mr. Okudaira when you took him the coffee?

46
00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:49,956
I was going to take it to him,

47
00:03:49,956 --> 00:03:53,156
but the coffee server that was supposed to be in the kitchen was gone.

48
00:03:53,156 --> 00:03:56,956
Oh, the coffee server that was supposed to be in the kitchen was gone,

49
00:03:56,956 --> 00:03:58,556
and here instead?

50
00:03:58,556 --> 00:04:03,456
I left to go shopping leaving the coffee server in the kitchen, though.

51
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,956
Which means, that between the time you, Kikuyo left to go shopping

52
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:09,656
and while Mrs. Okudaira was with me,

53
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:11,956
somebody put a sleeping drug inside the coffee server

54
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:14,256
that was left in the kitchen,

55
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:17,156
and you took it to your husband.

56
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:21,456
What? I didn't do it!

57
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:25,856
I was cleaning Tango's car, and after I finished,

58
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:30,056
I went to the living room where everyone was.

59
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:32,556
That was when I heard the vase crack.

60
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:36,556
He was definitely with us when we heard the crack.

61
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:37,756
I see.

62
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:40,256
And who's Tango?

63
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:42,356
He is Mr. Okudaira's oldest son

64
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:46,756
who was killed here by the pool a year ago.

65
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:51,056
I was summoned here to unravel the case of a year ago.

66
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:52,256
I see.

67
00:04:52,256 --> 00:04:58,456
But, that man was really looking forward to hearing Pop's deduction!

68
00:04:58,456 --> 00:05:00,256
See! It's written on this memo sheet,

69
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:05,656
deduction show of the Sleeping Kogoro from 4:00 pm today.

70
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:11,456
Ow, ouch.

71
00:05:11,456 --> 00:05:14,756
I tell you brat, going around sniffing around again.

72
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:16,056
In other words,

73
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:18,756
Mr. Okudaira was hoping that the incident of a year ago

74
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,056
would be solved at about sundown today,

75
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:24,456
and was trying to gather everyone in this house.

76
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:28,656
If so, the more it is unlikely that he committed suicide.

77
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:31,556
I guess you can say so.

78
00:05:32,656 --> 00:05:33,856
This is...

79
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:35,556
a trace that it was wet.

80
00:05:36,956 --> 00:05:39,556
Coffee?

81
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:42,056
The table top is clean.

82
00:05:42,056 --> 00:05:45,556
There is no trace of coffee having spilt.

83
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:47,356
This means...

84
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:51,056
My god, though. What is with this stack of books?

85
00:05:51,056 --> 00:05:53,356
Was he going all out cleaning out the room or something?

86
00:05:53,356 --> 00:05:57,656
No, the large books that my husband ordered arrived today

87
00:05:57,656 --> 00:05:59,856
and he moved the other books

88
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:02,556
to make space for the books that newly arrived.

89
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:07,356
I see and... where are those large books?

90
00:06:07,356 --> 00:06:09,056
Well...

91
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:11,656
It's that book over there.

92
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:15,456
It sure is large.

93
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:20,356
But, why is the book that just arrived on the floor near the door?

94
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:24,356
Maybe the culprit put it there for some reason?

95
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:26,456
Like to carry out some kind of trick or something.

96
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:29,956
You're Eisuke Hondo, if I remember correctly?

97
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,256
What brings you here?

98
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:35,856
Yes, my mother used to work as a housekeeper here.

99
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:37,656
I got a call saying that her belongings were found

100
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:39,056
so I came to get then.

101
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:41,656
Your mother passed away?

102
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:44,256
Yes, about ten years ago.

103
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:45,856
A picture of her back then is...

104
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:49,556
Oh, I tripped by the pool and changed clothes.

105
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:52,856
I put those clothes in the washing machine a while ago.

106
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:55,856
There was no picture in the pockets.

107
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:57,656
What?

108
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:06,056
Don't tell me you dropped it when you tripped a while ago.

109
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:16,756
My mother's picture.

110
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:27,256
Be careful.

111
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:29,456
Yes, I know.

112
00:07:40,056 --> 00:07:43,356
Gee, I told you to be careful!

113
00:07:43,356 --> 00:07:45,856
Ouch.

114
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:49,856
Here. I'll hold the picture for you.

115
00:07:49,856 --> 00:07:52,356
Oh, thanks! Please do.

116
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:03,156
I see, so that's the story.

117
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:07,756
Oh, don't lose the picture, okay?

118
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:11,356
Don't worry! I wrapped it in my handkerchief and put it away!

119
00:08:21,056 --> 00:08:23,556
Here, tissue paper. Your face is soiled.

120
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:25,556
Oh, thank you.

121
00:08:32,456 --> 00:08:34,856
We've got to do something about you being such a blooper.

122
00:08:34,856 --> 00:08:37,756
Or else your sister will be shocked when you found her.

123
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:39,456
It's all right.

124
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:52,456
But, nothing's new about me being unlucky so,

125
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:53,956
I think that in my older sister's eyes,

126
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:58,056
Eisuke equals an unreliable younger brother.

127
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:04,856
I see. So, that's the story.

128
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:09,256
Conan? Where are you going?

129
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:11,256
To Pop's!

130
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:13,456
Did you find something out again?

131
00:09:13,456 --> 00:09:15,456
Yeah, I sure did.

132
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:19,256
I've figured out who the ruthless killer is.

133
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:23,256
The killer from the Land of the Dead!

134
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:26,656
This is undoubtedly a dying message

135
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:28,756
left behind by Mr. Okudaira.

136
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:32,856
The meaning is Greek.

137
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:35,156
I'm sure it's just coincidental.

138
00:09:35,156 --> 00:09:37,156
It could be that he just bit his lip right before he died

139
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:38,156
because he was really vexed,

140
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:41,556
and the blood that dripped just happened to look like a message.

141
00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:43,256
Just a coincidence.

142
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:47,756
If that book is a dying message,

143
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:51,856
does that mean that the killer is among us here after all?

144
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:54,656
No, your husband committed suicide.

145
00:09:54,656 --> 00:09:56,856
Please think it over well.

146
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:58,856
When the housekeeper and steward

147
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:01,056
heard the vase crack rushed over to the room,

148
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:02,856
and was about to open the door

149
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:05,456
when Mr. Okudaira shouted from inside.

150
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:09,456
This means he was still alive at that time.

151
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:11,256
Moreover, when they did open the door,

152
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:13,456
they say that his body was still swaying,

153
00:10:13,456 --> 00:10:16,656
so there's probably no mistake in thinking that he committed suicide.

154
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:19,656
As for the vase, he didn't want anyone else to have it,

155
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:21,756
so he cracked it before he killed himself.

156
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:23,856
Then, what did he use as a steps tool?

157
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,456
He probably stacked the books that are scattered all over the floor up

158
00:10:27,456 --> 00:10:29,456
and used them as a step stool...

159
00:10:31,656 --> 00:10:33,956
Is Mr. Mouri all right?

160
00:10:33,956 --> 00:10:35,156
Yes, most probably.

161
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:36,656
It's finally come.

162
00:10:36,656 --> 00:10:39,456
Yes, I've finally realized

163
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:42,656
by my own words, "stack the books up."

164
00:10:42,656 --> 00:10:44,156
I've figured out the truth about

165
00:10:44,156 --> 00:10:46,756
the ruthless trick that was carried out in this room.

166
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:51,056
As well as the fact that the killer who committed the murder

167
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:53,456
is among the three who are here too.

168
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:57,427
You're saying that Mr. Okudaira did not commit suicide

169
00:10:57,427 --> 00:11:00,027
but was killed?

170
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:02,527
Right, Inspector Megure.

171
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,527
As usual, he's saying the exact opposite

172
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:06,227
of what he just said a while ago.

173
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:08,427
Let's carry out the trick

174
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:11,127
that made Mr. Okudaira's death look like suicide.

175
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:12,527
Officer Takagi!

176
00:11:12,527 --> 00:11:15,527
First of all, please put that cart right under the place

177
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:17,227
where Mr. Okudaira is suspended in air.

178
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:18,727
Yes, sir.

179
00:11:22,027 --> 00:11:26,827
Then stack up the books that are scattered around about a meter high

180
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:28,527
and sit on it.

181
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:30,027
You want me to sit on it?

182
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:32,727
Oh, and make sure the books stay in place.

183
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:36,027
Oh, okay.

184
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:49,727
I'm sitting down on it.

185
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:52,927
Then, Inspector Megure, please close the door

186
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:55,027
and line the remaining books up lengthwise

187
00:11:55,027 --> 00:11:58,427
from the tires of the cart to the door.

188
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:04,727
Like this?

189
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:11,127
Yes. Then, please put the large book in the foreground of the door.

190
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:12,427
That one?

191
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:14,127
Because the book that was closest to the door

192
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:17,527
when the body was found was that one.

193
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:19,727
All done.

194
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:25,327
Well, this is the way the rope was put around Mr. Okudaira's neck.

195
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,727
Now all that was needed to be done was for someone to open the door.

196
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:31,627
It... it's heavy.

197
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:35,427
But, if you open the door exerting a bit of strength,

198
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:37,527
the books will be pushed by the door and move.

199
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:38,927
The book will in turn push the cart,

200
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:40,627
and Mr. Okudaira who is on top of the stack of books

201
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,027
on the moving cart will lose balance

202
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:45,727
and slide down from the stack of books.

203
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:48,427
And, Mr. Okudaira's body

204
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:50,327
would be hanging with the rope around his neck

205
00:12:50,327 --> 00:12:52,927
like when you found him.

206
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:54,227
I see.

207
00:12:54,227 --> 00:12:57,427
But, no matter if he was made to sit on the stack of books,

208
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:58,627
he could've removed the rope that was around his neck

209
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:00,027
with both his hands, no?

210
00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:03,827
But, glue was stuck on to the part connecting the rope,

211
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:06,127
so that it wouldn't come off easily.

212
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:10,327
But, didn't you remove that rope when you were getting the body down?

213
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:12,927
Yes, if Mr. Okudaira took his time and went about it carefully,

214
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:16,427
he may have been able to remove it without losing his balance.

215
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:19,027
But, it seems he couldn't do so.

216
00:13:19,027 --> 00:13:21,627
He wasn't able to use both his hands.

217
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:23,127
Couldn't use both hands?

218
00:13:23,127 --> 00:13:26,827
But, there were no traces of the hands being tied on the corpse.

219
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:30,627
More accurately, I would say both his hands were full.

220
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:32,627
Just what do you mean?

221
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:36,327
He was holding the vase he treasured

222
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:39,427
with both hands behind his back.

223
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:48,627
Please look at the mouth of the vase that is on the floor.

224
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,827
As proof that he was made to hold the vase

225
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:52,927
until both his hands started to perspire

226
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:54,827
the vase is a bit glossy, isn't it?

227
00:13:54,827 --> 00:13:56,227
True.

228
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:58,627
But, no matter how much the vase meant to him,

229
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:01,627
won't he let it go if he's life is in danger?

230
00:14:01,627 --> 00:14:04,827
If he lets go, what would happen to the vase?

231
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:06,727
It would fall to the floor and crack.

232
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:09,027
What'll happen to the vase if it cracks?

233
00:14:09,027 --> 00:14:11,127
Of course a loud sound will be heard and...

234
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:14,827
I get it! If a loud sound is heard, someone will run over,

235
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:17,827
the door would be opened and he would be hung.

236
00:14:17,827 --> 00:14:24,227
Yeah. That's why Mr. Okudaira shouted, "Don't open the door!"

237
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:25,727
I see!

238
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:28,227
But, how did the killer get out of the room

239
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:30,227
after setting up the trick?

240
00:14:30,227 --> 00:14:32,027
Well, please take a look.

241
00:14:32,027 --> 00:14:34,127
Hey, Conan, do it.

242
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:36,027
Okay, I got it.

243
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:39,527
First, you open the door,

244
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:43,527
then you lean the book against the door that is open,

245
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:45,527
sneak out of the space between the door

246
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:48,027
and close the door gently.

247
00:14:50,227 --> 00:14:52,827
So, that's how!

248
00:14:52,827 --> 00:14:56,727
This way, it can be made to look like suicide.

249
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:00,727
But it's still difficult to track the killer down.

250
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:01,927
True.

251
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:03,827
Then, can you figure out

252
00:15:03,827 --> 00:15:07,027
why only the book in front of the door is large?

253
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:08,427
What do you mean why?

254
00:15:08,427 --> 00:15:11,627
The killer had to open a large space using the large book

255
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:15,027
in order to get through the door.

256
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:18,027
And, that killer is...

257
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:25,127
you, housekeeper Kikuyo, isn't it?

258
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:27,527
No way, Kikuyo couldn't have!

259
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:32,927
But, Kikuyo was out shopping for milk to put in the coffee at that time.

260
00:15:32,927 --> 00:15:35,327
She probably went to buy it after committing the murder.

261
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:37,427
As for the coffee, probably knowing that she would be asked to serve it,

262
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:40,327
she prepared it beforehand.

263
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:46,827
Yes. Kikuyo put a sleeping drug in the coffee

264
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:48,627
and put Mr. Okudaira to sleep

265
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:51,927
after letting him sit on the stack of books that she piled up.

266
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:56,027
She then put the rope around his neck, gluing on the connecting part

267
00:15:56,027 --> 00:15:58,127
then abruptly woke him up,

268
00:15:58,127 --> 00:16:01,327
after which she made him hold the vase on his hands behind his back.

269
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,727
She threatened him saying that if he didn't hold the vase,

270
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:05,327
it would drop right away, crack, the books would collapse,

271
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:06,927
and the rope would eventually choke him to death.

272
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:10,227
She then leaves the room in the way I explained a while ago,

273
00:16:10,227 --> 00:16:12,727
rushed over to the room when the sound of the vase cracking was heard

274
00:16:12,727 --> 00:16:14,727
and forced the door open.

275
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:17,827
At the same time, in order to conceal her trick,

276
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:19,627
she pretended to stop Mrs. Okudaira

277
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:23,827
by tripping over the books on the floor.

278
00:16:23,827 --> 00:16:27,127
It sure is a well prepared and ruthless way of killing someone.

279
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:30,427
Yes, he didn't have a chance, if he got tired and dropped the vase,

280
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:33,027
he dies, neither could he call someone for help.

281
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:36,727
Yes, this ruthless murder method is exactly the same

282
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:38,927
as the method of murder that was committed here

283
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:41,227
at the pool a year ago, of Tango, his son,

284
00:16:41,227 --> 00:16:45,627
who was drowned to death by the killer!

285
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:49,027
Are you saying that there was a trick to that murder too?

286
00:16:49,027 --> 00:16:52,027
Yes. Only the pool trick was simpler

287
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:55,627
because all that needed to be done was to tie both his legs and hands,

288
00:16:55,627 --> 00:16:59,627
cover his mouth with masking tape and throw him into the pool.

289
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:02,727
-Throw him inside? -What trick involved is there?

290
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:06,227
His son's height was almost the same as Eisuke.

291
00:17:06,227 --> 00:17:07,927
The water stain left in the pool

292
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:11,827
was at just about the position of where Eisuke's eyebrow is,

293
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:15,127
so if he tiptoed, he could keep his nose out of the water.

294
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:16,927
The killer probably told Tango,

295
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:21,527
"If you can hold on for an hour, I'll drain the water of the pool out."

296
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:23,327
I see, if so,

297
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:25,827
the son probably tried to keep standing on tiptoe with all his might,

298
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:28,827
while the killer establishes an alibi.

299
00:17:28,827 --> 00:17:32,527
If he is left as is, he is bound to get tired eventually and drown.

300
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:35,427
Yeah. Tango was into body building,

301
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:37,727
so even if he wanted to make his body float,

302
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:40,827
he couldn't because his muscles were too heavy.

303
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,827
Isn't that right, Kikuyo?

304
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:47,627
You mean the murderer of the case one year ago

305
00:17:47,627 --> 00:17:48,727
is also the housekeeper?

306
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:50,027
Yeah, most probably

307
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,427
because the method of making the victim suffer till he dies

308
00:17:53,427 --> 00:17:55,527
is much too similar.

309
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:59,427
But, you don't have proof that Kikuyo is the murderer, do you?

310
00:17:59,427 --> 00:18:02,727
Mr. Segawa and I could've used that method to kill them too.

311
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:04,027
Right.

312
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:07,827
I think that the greater also serves the smaller.

313
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:12,227
And besides, if what was found is my husband's dying message,

314
00:18:12,227 --> 00:18:13,827
how does the "Yomi" (Land of the Dead) and the hiragana "ko

315
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,727
connect to Kikuyo?

316
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,727
That's not the hiragana "ko"

317
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,227
but rather, the mathematical symbol meaning equal!

318
00:18:19,227 --> 00:18:21,227
What that message is saying

319
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:23,727
is that "Yomi" (Land of the Dead) equals "Meido" (Hades).

320
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,627
And so, that lead us to "Maid" (Pronouced as Meido in Japanese).

321
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:28,527
Therefore, the housekeeper.

322
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:35,127
Moreover, there is more conclusive evidence than this dying message.

323
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:39,327
It's inside the right pocket of Kikuyo's apron!

324
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,627
Kikuyo.

325
00:18:40,627 --> 00:18:43,827
You took the tissue that Mrs. Okudaira blew her nose with

326
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:46,327
and put it in your left pocket, didn't you?

327
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:49,927
You took the receipt from the supermarket out of the same pocket

328
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:52,127
and put it back in there again.

329
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:53,227
Most people would never put a receipt

330
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:56,827
that is deemed important in the same pocket with trash in it.

331
00:18:56,827 --> 00:19:01,327
Then, it dawned on me that maybe in your right pocket,

332
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:02,527
you had something inside that

333
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,827
you didn't want the officers to find out about.

334
00:19:05,827 --> 00:19:07,327
Excuse me.

335
00:19:10,327 --> 00:19:12,327
Inspector! There's a handkerchief

336
00:19:12,327 --> 00:19:14,727
with what looks to be a coffee stain on it.

337
00:19:14,727 --> 00:19:16,527
She gave Mrs. Okudaira who was crying

338
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:20,027
a piece of tissue paper, instead of her handkerchief.

339
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:23,427
Although there was a trace of coffee under the table,

340
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:25,827
the tabletop was clean.

341
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:28,727
Your husband probably spilt the coffee with sleeping drug in

342
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:29,827
when drinking it.

343
00:19:29,827 --> 00:19:31,127
She probably wiped the spill with the handkerchief

344
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:34,527
and still has it in her right pocket.

345
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:38,027
Okay, send that handkerchief to the forensic section.

346
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:40,427
If they detect the substance of a sleeping drug on it,

347
00:19:40,427 --> 00:19:43,327
-that will serve as proof. -Yes, sir.

348
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:46,427
But why, Kikuyo?

349
00:19:46,427 --> 00:19:47,727
Why would you do something like that?

350
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:49,027
It probably has something to do

351
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:52,227
with the accident involving the steward two years ago.

352
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:55,027
I think that the reason has something to do with Tango

353
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,827
who stopped riding his car around that time.

354
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:01,627
Nobody's driven his car for two years, right?

355
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:03,027
No.

356
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:05,627
Nobody could've ridden it.

357
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:10,527
Because Tango ran someone over with it.

358
00:20:10,527 --> 00:20:14,027
Back then, Tango was driving a foreign made car

359
00:20:14,027 --> 00:20:17,827
that the previous steward was driving to take Mr. Okudaira places.

360
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:20,027
After having taken the car out without permission,

361
00:20:20,027 --> 00:20:23,227
he drove around to his heart's content, then ran over a person.

362
00:20:23,227 --> 00:20:24,727
He went crying on his father's shoulder,

363
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:26,127
who was outraged at the previous steward

364
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:28,027
for urging Tango to turn himself in.

365
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:33,227
And two years ago today, his car went over the cliff.

366
00:20:36,427 --> 00:20:38,527
Don't tell me that the accident...

367
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,727
Tango, who I drowned in the pool told me

368
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:43,827
that he cooperated with his father and got the previous steward drunk,

369
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:48,627
then made the car over the cliff in order to keep him from talking

370
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:52,727
as well as to hide the scratch on the car.

371
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:56,027
Then, you mean, my older brother was killed?

372
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:58,127
That's why you chose the day

373
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:01,027
that the previous steward died and killed the two.

374
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:04,627
How did you find out that it wasn't an accident?

375
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:08,627
Although the car went over the cliff, he didn't have his gloves on.

376
00:21:08,627 --> 00:21:14,027
He always wore those gloves when he drove,

377
00:21:14,027 --> 00:21:17,827
because I gave it to him as a gift.

378
00:21:30,227 --> 00:21:31,727
Hey, Ran!

379
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:34,127
We're heading home!

380
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,527
Where the heck is she?

381
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:41,127
I saw your daughter and the others by the bathroom just a while ago.

382
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:44,627
Bathroom?

383
00:21:44,627 --> 00:21:46,527
Darn!

384
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:47,527
Hey.

385
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:51,527
I tell you! I off my guard about things like this!

386
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:54,427
Hey, come off it, what a thing to do out of the blue like that!

387
00:21:54,427 --> 00:21:56,027
Oh, I'm sorry.

388
00:21:56,027 --> 00:21:57,927
Darn you!

389
00:22:00,127 --> 00:22:01,727
Hi.

390
00:22:02,927 --> 00:22:04,627
What're you doing?

391
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:08,027
His clothes got dirty so he was changing back to his original clothes.

392
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:11,327
But, he starting taking them off right in front of me.

393
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:15,327
But, I used to change in front of my older sister all the time.

394
00:22:23,127 --> 00:22:26,227
Don't tell me he's...

395
00:23:52,227 --> 00:23:55,127
The whereabouts of Eisuke Hondo is unknown?

396
00:23:55,127 --> 00:24:01,327
I hear he found a clue to his father who used to work for the Company.

397
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:04,627
Don't tell me that aside from the Men in Black,

398
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:08,827
even the Company is looking for Rena Mizunashi?

399
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:11,527
The hands of a global organization is closing in on Rena Mizunashi,

400
00:24:11,527 --> 00:24:13,027
who continues to sleep!

401
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:17,327
Next on Detective Conan,

402
00:24:17,327 --> 00:24:21,627
"Red and Black Crash: Coma."

403
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:39,227
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,427
Seven children.

405
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:42,727
Seven children remind me of the children's song about crows.

406
00:24:42,727 --> 00:24:45,227
-Crows are black. -Black brings to mind the Organization.
