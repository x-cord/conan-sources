1
00:00:01,577 --> 00:00:03,666
The Sleeping Kogoro.

2
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:07,777
There was a case the old man solved before he was known by that name.

3
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:16,197
And it was the beginning of everything that happened in this case.

4
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:20,037
Please help me, Mori-san.

5
00:00:20,477 --> 00:00:25,547
Someone stole my precious brooch.

6
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:28,556
I don't know when it was stolen,

7
00:00:28,557 --> 00:00:33,637
but I noticed this morning because I found this in my mailbox.

8
00:00:34,097 --> 00:00:35,407
Let me take a look.

9
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:38,656
"I have your precious brooch.

10
00:00:38,657 --> 00:00:41,316
If you want it back, come and get it in the underworld.

11
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:42,966
Come to Kuroochi Park.

12
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:47,447
If you notify the police, I'll dispose of your treasure immediately."

13
00:00:47,827 --> 00:00:49,636
The underworld, huh?

14
00:00:49,637 --> 00:00:52,447
Why is this brooch a treasure?

15
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:58,407
It's not expensive, but it's a keepsake from my mother who passed away the other day.

16
00:00:58,957 --> 00:01:03,837
I'd like to settle this quietly, which is why I'm asking you for help rather than the police.

17
00:01:04,057 --> 00:01:05,207
I understand.

18
00:01:06,244 --> 00:01:08,654
But this word...

19
00:01:09,284 --> 00:01:15,904
It's possible they're using this stolen treasure as bait to lure her into her own murder.

20
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:20,003
But she sure is pretty!

21
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:21,143
Is there a problem?

22
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:23,664
Oh, no!

23
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:26,353
You can count on me.

24
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:33,134
The great Mori Kogoro has never accepted a job and failed!

25
00:01:34,164 --> 00:01:35,693
Thank you.

26
00:01:35,694 --> 00:01:38,654
You really are as great a detective as they say.

27
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:41,894
What's he talking about?

28
00:01:42,404 --> 00:01:45,624
But what do they mean by "underworld?"

29
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:54,753
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

30
00:01:54,754 --> 00:01:56,563
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

31
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:58,423
The beautiful woman's mysterious letter!

32
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:00,563
The Sleeping Kogoro approaches the underworld!

33
00:02:00,564 --> 00:02:02,143
Always determining the one truth

34
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:03,833
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

35
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:06,214
his name is Detective Conan!

36
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:50,234
Leading a Detective Around By the Nose

37
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:54,536
This is the place.

38
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:59,876
This is actually my first time at Kuroochi Park.

39
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:01,746
Where's the entrance?

40
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:06,126
Bibibi Publishing

41
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:13,116
That's right. This place...

42
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:16,885
Mori-san, is something wrong?

43
00:04:16,886 --> 00:04:18,266
Oh, no!

44
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:20,236
Let's go.

45
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:25,995
Now, where is it?

46
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:31,276
The brooch... The brooch... The brooch...

47
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:37,545
We haven't found a sign of your treasure or the culprit.

48
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:39,256
What should we do?

49
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:41,996
What's that sound?

50
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:44,656
What's that?

51
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:48,296
Kaetsu Kanae-sama

52
00:04:48,826 --> 00:04:49,846
What's this?

53
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:53,756
It's just like the letter I received.

54
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:56,556
Let's see. What's inside?

55
00:04:57,516 --> 00:04:59,575
"So you hired Detective Mori.

56
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:03,755
The two of you can enjoy the road to hell together.

57
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:08,316
If you want your treasure back, come to Dadagaya Concert Hall."

58
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:12,415
How does the culprit know I hired you?

59
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:18,326
They were probably watching from somewhere inside the park to see if you'd bring the police.

60
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:23,576
While we were searching every inch of the park,

61
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:26,916
the culprit wrote this letter.

62
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:32,785
Then they stuffed it inside that clock so it would be discovered and left.

63
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:37,006
Then the culprit was here somewhere in this park.

64
00:05:37,346 --> 00:05:37,846
Yes.

65
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:43,395
But they make it sound like they're fine dealing with a detective and not the police.

66
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:46,356
They've underestimated Mori Kogoro!

67
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,056
Let's go to Dadagaya Concert Hall.

68
00:05:54,686 --> 00:05:59,366
Anyway, isn't this place a little far for a second location?

69
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:02,476
It is all the way on the east side.

70
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:06,376
Looks like an outdoor concert hall.

71
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:08,126
Yes, it's a wonderful place.

72
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,256
Watch out!

73
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:22,556
That car...

74
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,356
So they are trying to kill us.

75
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:27,816
It's all right.

76
00:06:29,446 --> 00:06:30,316
What's that?

77
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:38,276
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:38,476 --> 00:06:39,786
It's important.

79
00:06:42,426 --> 00:06:44,185
Let's go.

80
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:45,076
All right.

81
00:06:51,206 --> 00:06:56,426
Do they want us to find the brooch since they hid it here somewhere?

82
00:06:58,576 --> 00:06:59,516
What's this?

83
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:03,806
"Next go to Sutero Art Museum?"

84
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:06,045
We're traveling again?

85
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:09,306
And it's on the complete opposite side of the city, on the west end!

86
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:12,276
Sutero Art Museum

87
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:17,806
I'm sorry for making you travel from one end of Tokyo to the other.

88
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:19,696
It's fine.

89
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:22,316
You don't need to apologize.

90
00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:33,456
That was close.

91
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:36,145
Maybe a crow knocked it over.

92
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:37,966
Well, it happens.

93
00:07:38,746 --> 00:07:40,256
Shall we go?

94
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:41,756
All right.

95
00:07:47,376 --> 00:07:49,175
I found an envelope.

96
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:50,266
What's inside?

97
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:54,396
"Next go to Hadoson Seaside Park?"

98
00:07:54,986 --> 00:07:57,426
Isn't Hadoson Seaside Park...?

99
00:07:58,696 --> 00:08:00,906
Hadoson Seaside Park

100
00:08:05,396 --> 00:08:06,906
What's this?

101
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,915
This place is a famous date destination!

102
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:14,175
It's midday on a weekday! What are these people doing?

103
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:16,415
Don't they have jobs? Right?

104
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,006
Uh, well...

105
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:22,636
What's going on? Is it the culprit?

106
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:27,306
You're the great detective Mori Kogoro, aren't you?

107
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:29,726
Could you take a picture with us?

108
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:32,226
No!

109
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:36,525
Actually, we...

110
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:41,106
We have to look after our cows, so we couldn't go on a honeymoon.

111
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:46,025
But we finally made time to come to Tokyo for two days.

112
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,225
But the cows are waiting for us,

113
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:51,826
so we have to fly home by tonight.

114
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:55,956
One photo, please.

115
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:57,126
What?

116
00:08:57,306 --> 00:08:59,066
Now smile!

117
00:09:02,986 --> 00:09:04,386
Thank you!

118
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,756
We're overjoyed!

119
00:09:06,186 --> 00:09:08,735
We'll never forget this day!

120
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:10,766
Thank you so much!

121
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:14,895
Good luck with your marriage!

122
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:15,686
Wait!

123
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:16,146
Yes?

124
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:18,646
This is no time to be doing this!

125
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:23,786
Shall we search around that monument?

126
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:28,476
Ouch...

127
00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:29,286
Is something wrong?

128
00:09:29,496 --> 00:09:31,286
It's nothing.

129
00:09:34,586 --> 00:09:36,635
Look. Right here.

130
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:37,836
Did you find something?

131
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:41,336
"Next go to Hebunzaka Church?"

132
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:46,375
Hebunzaka Church is on the outskirts of Tokyo, isn't it?

133
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:48,346
Yes, on the north side.

134
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,646
I can only assume we're being toyed with.

135
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:56,076
The culprit is definitely trying to kill this woman, but...

136
00:09:57,286 --> 00:09:58,606
That brat!

137
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:03,636
Hey! What are you doing here?

138
00:10:06,426 --> 00:10:09,616
Jeez! Why'd you have to follow me?

139
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:12,305
Once you finish eating that, you're heading straight home.

140
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:14,205
Now, now, Mori-san.

141
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:16,525
I need to go to the bathroom.

142
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:18,965
Huh? Oh, go ahead.

143
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:23,175
So, what do you think of this case?

144
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:24,256
Huh?

145
00:10:24,526 --> 00:10:31,385
Have you figured out what the places you've been visiting have in common?

146
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:33,605
I have no idea!

147
00:10:33,606 --> 00:10:35,595
This is my first time...

148
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:36,516
No.

149
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:40,935
I have been to the area around Kuroochi Park once.

150
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:41,786
What?

151
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:43,395
It was two years ago.

152
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:45,476
A broadly disliked diet member

153
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:50,316
who kept making suspicious remarks met a mysterious end.

154
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:55,166
Believing it was murder, I saw through the culprit's scheme and tracked them down.

155
00:10:55,976 --> 00:11:00,685
He was a man named Nagakura Ryoji,

156
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:03,376
who managed an art book publishing company with his friend.

157
00:11:05,146 --> 00:11:09,466
I brought him to the roof of the publishing company and confronted him with my deduction.

158
00:11:10,396 --> 00:11:14,706
He accepted everything I said without objection, but...

159
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:18,186
He's a cancer on society.

160
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:25,346
I don't regret killing him based on my beliefs.

161
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:30,696
Though I doubt the courts or society would understand.

162
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,405
After being arrested,

163
00:11:34,406 --> 00:11:41,016
Nagakura took his own life in prison before his trial began.

164
00:11:45,716 --> 00:11:48,195
You solved that case?

165
00:11:48,196 --> 00:11:51,466
Yeah! I'm telling you, I'm a great detective.

166
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:57,996
It's possible he decided to commit suicide when I revealed the truth on that rooftop.

167
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:01,906
It happened on the roof of the building across from Kuroochi Park.

168
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:06,575
Well, it's ancient history.

169
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:09,856
Someone is definitely trying to kill Kanae-san.

170
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:11,866
Actually, those were...

171
00:12:12,346 --> 00:12:15,366
I can't believe a family of cats ran into the road.

172
00:12:15,656 --> 00:12:18,366
I dropped it from the third floor, but it's not broken.

173
00:12:18,556 --> 00:12:21,716
I knew it was too dangerous to practice here.

174
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,756
...just plain old accidents.

175
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:30,255
Let me handle the case.

176
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:32,566
Go do your homework or something.

177
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:35,636
Tell Ran I'll be home late.

178
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:37,136
Okay.

179
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:52,946
There must be some meaning behind the locations specified by the culprit.

180
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:55,566
That must be it.

181
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:57,366
What's going on?

182
00:12:59,186 --> 00:13:00,666
Did something happen?

183
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:06,965
Oh, yeah. I was wondering what that meant.

184
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:08,876
Aren't they an offering of some kind?

185
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:12,496
But there's never been an accident here.

186
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:16,626
I haven't heard of anyone dying either.

187
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:20,235
They started at the park,

188
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:25,896
then visited the concert hall, the art museum, the seaside park, the church, and...

189
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,996
Could it be?

190
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:39,252
I've given the case some thought.

191
00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:43,701
Why is the culprit leading us around?

192
00:13:43,702 --> 00:13:47,932
It's possible they want us to notice something.

193
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:54,731
Kuroochi Park, Dadagaya Concert Hall, Sutero Art Museum, Hadoson Seaside Park,

194
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:57,942
and our next destination, Hebunzaka Church.

195
00:13:58,342 --> 00:14:01,951
Each location has a special meaning or memory associated with it,

196
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:04,241
and they want you to notice that.

197
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:08,952
I have a feeling the culprit is desperately asking you to do that.

198
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:14,051
Any ideas what that might be, Kanae-san?

199
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:17,041
What do you think, Mori-san?

200
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:17,962
Me?

201
00:14:18,362 --> 00:14:22,081
I just happened to be hired. There's no way for me to know.

202
00:14:22,082 --> 00:14:24,302
Even though you're the country's greatest detective?

203
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:28,971
I'm sorry, but I can't know what I don't know.

204
00:14:28,972 --> 00:14:31,172
I'm at a total loss.

205
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:37,542
Excuse me!

206
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:39,841
You work here, right?

207
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:43,701
I'm the detective Mori Kogoro's assistant.

208
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:45,992
You work for Mori-san?

209
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:50,291
He told me to ask you about Nagakura Ryoji-san,

210
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:52,742
who passed away two years ago.

211
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:55,192
I found it.

212
00:14:55,752 --> 00:14:59,492
Where are we being taken next?

213
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:02,922
Is it a map?

214
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:08,071
12, 1, 29. What do those numbers mean?

215
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:10,182
Could it be an address?

216
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:14,602
In any case, let's use these clues to determine the location.

217
00:15:17,412 --> 00:15:21,091
Omagari Intersection is way on the outskirts of Tokyo.

218
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:24,812
And if it's between there and Shiraito Intersection, then...

219
00:15:27,132 --> 00:15:31,122
So that's how it is! When you think of it that way...

220
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:34,482
Mori-san. Mori-san!

221
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:38,312
"Come and get it in the underworld."

222
00:15:39,182 --> 00:15:42,882
It seems our next destination is the finish line.

223
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:44,452
Isn't that...?

224
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:48,622
Yes, it's a graveyard.

225
00:15:50,202 --> 00:15:53,892
Does the culprit plan to lure me there and...?

226
00:15:56,912 --> 00:15:58,892
Let's head there.

227
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:01,401
Really?

228
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:06,131
That person left these flowers here this morning and said that?

229
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,431
That's right.

230
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:08,692
Hey, wait!

231
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:12,662
That was definitely them.

232
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:16,912
Incoming call Conan

233
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,172
He hung up!

234
00:16:23,842 --> 00:16:25,082
What should I do?

235
00:16:28,262 --> 00:16:30,182
Underworld

236
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:34,051
I have one more question!

237
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:36,312
Where is Nagakura-san's grave?

238
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:39,682
Okagaoka Cemetery

239
00:16:43,022 --> 00:16:46,022
Zone 12 Area 1 Section 9

240
00:16:48,532 --> 00:16:53,682
You wanted to bring me here.

241
00:16:55,372 --> 00:17:00,462
When I learned our next destination was Okagaoka Cemetery, I finally noticed.

242
00:17:01,372 --> 00:17:05,672
It wasn't you who was being dragged around, but me.

243
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:10,332
I'd been here to visit this grave before.

244
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:13,361
You figured it out, old man?

245
00:17:13,362 --> 00:17:15,682
Then I don't need to make an appearance.

246
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:22,692
You lied about your treasured brooch being stolen so you could bring me here.

247
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:25,942
I didn't know about you,

248
00:17:26,222 --> 00:17:29,942
but judging by that ring you have in your bag,

249
00:17:30,452 --> 00:17:34,952
you were probably engaged to Nagakura Ryoji-san.

250
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:39,952
You brought me to places full of memories, and finally, at his grave...

251
00:17:40,182 --> 00:17:41,452
Aren't you going to sleep?

252
00:17:43,182 --> 00:17:43,962
What?

253
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:47,871
Don't you always sleep when you arrogantly lay out your reasoning?

254
00:17:47,872 --> 00:17:49,882
Oh, actually, that's...

255
00:17:51,162 --> 00:17:52,512
If you can't sleep...

256
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:56,762
Then I'll put you to sleep!

257
00:17:58,272 --> 00:17:58,852
You're wrong!

258
00:18:00,002 --> 00:18:02,291
You may not know,

259
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:06,512
but I wasn't asleep when I solved that case then.

260
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:10,802
Since the day Nagakura ended his life,

261
00:18:11,272 --> 00:18:14,782
you swore you'd have your revenge on me.

262
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:16,461
Of course!

263
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,481
If you hadn't arrogantly revealed the truth,

264
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:22,082
then he wouldn't have been arrested!

265
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:32,132
Uh, oh...

266
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:34,801
So you're sleeping after all.

267
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:39,722
I thought it would only be proper to assume this pose while explaining my reasoning.

268
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:44,431
People who knew him well said the following:

269
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:49,482
"Nagakura-san was a quiet man who loved music and art."

270
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:55,652
Did the two of you meet at Dadagaya Concert Hall?

271
00:18:57,812 --> 00:19:01,242
And the first place you went together was Sutero Art Museum.

272
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:06,882
You nurtured your love at beautiful Hadoson Seaside Park,

273
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:13,202
and planned to get married at Hebunzaka Church.

274
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:20,012
But Nagakura-san's death turned it into an impossible dream.

275
00:19:20,522 --> 00:19:21,901
That's right.

276
00:19:21,902 --> 00:19:27,152
You ruined our history and future.

277
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:29,482
After showing you that, I...

278
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:38,032
Here, in his presence, I planned to send you to hell!

279
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:40,282
And you...

280
00:19:46,522 --> 00:19:51,792
It all ended when he cornered you on that roof.

281
00:19:52,742 --> 00:19:55,962
I'll be there soon.

282
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,802
...planned to follow Nagakura-san here.

283
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:03,052
It's the decision I made when he died.

284
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:05,562
But you did nothing for two years.

285
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:08,761
This isn't what Nagakura-san wants.

286
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:09,752
You're wrong.

287
00:20:09,753 --> 00:20:11,581
You know that, too.

288
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:15,571
You're wrong! It's because my mother was alive until last week!

289
00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:17,851
If I did that, my mother would have been sad—

290
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:20,952
Regardless of who it saddens, people who will act, will act!

291
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:23,152
Put that knife away.

292
00:20:23,692 --> 00:20:27,061
You've waited until today because you knew Nagakura-san wouldn't want—

293
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:27,952
You're wrong!

294
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:28,542
Shit!

295
00:20:39,912 --> 00:20:43,892
But I can't do it...

296
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:46,602
I saw you.

297
00:20:47,262 --> 00:20:51,822
I saw the unhateable face of the man I hated.

298
00:20:52,492 --> 00:20:54,112
Your perfect kindness.

299
00:20:54,682 --> 00:20:57,112
The way you acknowledged your own powerlessness.

300
00:20:58,002 --> 00:21:01,612
And you protected me numerous times.

301
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:04,912
After seeing that side of you,

302
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:09,132
I can't kill you anymore.

303
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,222
Not anyone.

304
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:53,801
Kanae-san! Don't be hasty!

305
00:22:53,802 --> 00:22:55,342
Huh?

306
00:22:56,202 --> 00:22:58,901
Sh-She's not here. Kanae-san!

307
00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:01,201
Ow! My head...

308
00:23:01,202 --> 00:23:03,461
The lady left.

309
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:07,162
What?! You followed me again?

310
00:23:07,382 --> 00:23:11,101
More importantly, she planned to kill me and then kill herself!

311
00:23:11,102 --> 00:23:12,971
Seems like everything worked out fine.

312
00:23:12,972 --> 00:23:13,912
What?

313
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:20,922
She asked me to thank you for her.

314
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,101
Really?

315
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,281
You prevented a crime before it happened.

316
00:23:25,282 --> 00:23:27,091
That's amazing, mister.

317
00:23:27,092 --> 00:23:28,401
You're right.

318
00:23:28,402 --> 00:23:30,642
You really are the country's greatest detective!

319
00:23:30,932 --> 00:23:31,932
You're right!

320
00:23:32,232 --> 00:23:33,042
You see that?

321
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:38,782
I protected a young woman and made her turn over a new leaf!

322
00:23:40,262 --> 00:23:42,892
Well, that's not entirely incorrect.

323
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:48,952
Could you tell us more about that case?

324
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:52,971
Unfortunately, I cannot do that.

325
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:56,951
We can't just give away our customers' information.

326
00:23:56,952 --> 00:24:00,712
Call on all officers and arrest all the suspects!

327
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:04,712
There's even a blueprint showing the remote detonators.

328
00:24:05,672 --> 00:24:08,972
Where is it? Where is the detonator?

329
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:13,092
The next episode of Conan is "An Encouragement of the Perfect Crime!"
