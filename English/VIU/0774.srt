1
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,629
Let's lift it up.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,630
Yes, sir.

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,329
So, this is Munch's "Despair".

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,330
Yes, and that's "Anxiety".

5
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,429
Who is the curator of the Suzuki Museum?

6
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,329
"Hiroshi Numajiri (35)" -Yes. I'm Numajiri.

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,829
These are the photos of "Despair" and "Anxiety"

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,429
that I took before boarding the plane.

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,130
Yes, I will confirm it.

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,429
"Scream" is going to arrive at Haneda Airport, right?

11
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,929
Since the art gallery that we're loaning it from is different,

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,729
the procedures are different, too.

13
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,530
What is Mr. Numajiri going to do?

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,129
He's going to check if there were any damages during transport

15
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,629
by checking them against the photos

16
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,129
that was taken before they were packed.

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,429
With a camera like that, you can develop the picture right there.

18
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,929
You see, unlike digital cameras they're difficult to tamper with.

19
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,329
That's why they're still in use to this day.

20
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,729
Advisor.

21
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,429
No damages are seen on neither "Despair" nor "Anxiety".

22
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,629
Okay.

23
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,329
Pack them.

24
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,330
Yes, sir.

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,329
Advisor, I'll head off to Haneda to check on "Scream".

26
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,830
I'm counting on you.

27
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,429
You really pack it securely, don't you?

28
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,129
Yes. They cost billions a piece...

29
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,529
Rather, tens of billions a piece.

30
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,829
Right, boss?

31
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,029
You're the boss.

32
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,529
Thanks for coming all this way.

33
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,629
Not at all.

34
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,829
"Keiji Shimamura (50)" -I really love Munch, you see.

35
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,229
To be able to transport three of his representative works,

36
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,130
I'm really honoured.

37
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,629
That truck is carrying "Anxiety" and "Despair" in it, right?

38
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,930
It sure sounds sort of sinister, though.

39
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,329
It's me.

40
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,130
I'm the curator, Numajiri.

41
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,829
Did "Scream" arrive safely?

42
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,830
Yes.

43
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:26,729
I confirmed it, and there seemed to be no problem,

44
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,629
so it's headed over for the Suzuki Museum.

45
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,829
Good work.

46
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,629
You go on ahead, too.

47
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,830
Yes, sir.

48
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,729
I knew about Munch's "Scream",

49
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,429
but as to "Anxiety" and "Despair", it's a first.

50
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,029
Well, Munch is well known for "Scream".

51
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,129
Munch himself seem to have favoured "Scream" too,

52
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,429
since he drew five of it

53
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,829
in oil paint, pastel paint, lithograph, and tempera painting.

54
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,729
You actually wanted to open a Munch exhibition

55
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,929
with all of the five "Scream" paintings. Right, sir?

56
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,829
But one of them is owned by an individual

57
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,629
and my hope of wanting to borrow it didn't work out.

58
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,329
That's why I decided to feature "Scream", "Despair" and "Anxiety"

59
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,429
to open my Munch exhibition.

60
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,229
Why did you choose those three?

61
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,430
You'll understand when the three are displayed together.

62
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,930
It's me.

63
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,029
Advisor! Bad news!

64
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,129
"Scream"!

65
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,629
"Scream" disappeared!

66
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,630
What?

67
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,729
Just what do you mean?

68
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,029
The car with "Scream" inside that was in front of us

69
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,830
suddenly went off route and disappeared!

70
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,229
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

71
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,129
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

72
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,929
In the movie it's Gogh and on TV it's Munch.

73
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,129
Solve the disasters of the masterpieces with deduction!

74
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,929
He sees through the one and only truth.

75
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,729
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

76
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,030
His name is Detective Conan!

77
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:48,209
"Munch's Scream Disappears"

78
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,208
Hello?

79
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:52,408
Oh, advisor.

80
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:55,808
I just got a hold of the transport company a while ago.

81
00:05:55,809 --> 00:05:56,809
Yes, sir.

82
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,008
No. The thing is, they say that they're moving along as scheduled.

83
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,209
Yes.

84
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:04,209
They seem to have left the checkpoint

85
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,108
just a while ago, a bit delayed.

86
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:10,108
But Mr. Numajiri who was right behind them

87
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:11,808
said that they went off route.

88
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:15,108
Yes, so I'll call Numajiri now.

89
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:16,508
Do that, will you?

90
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,409
What's a checkpoint?

91
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:22,808
It's a place where the car is stopped once

92
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:24,709
to check if the loaded goods are okay.

93
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:31,909
Advisor!

94
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:36,608
Mr. Numajiri, you're here already.

95
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:38,308
And where's the "Scream"?

96
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:39,508
Not here yet.

97
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,308
I'm going to go check on "Despair" and "Anxiety".

98
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:44,908
Do that, will you?

99
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:47,008
I'll go over to the gallery head's office.

100
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:48,209
Yes, sir.

101
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,208
The photos of the package please.

102
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:52,409
Yes, sir.

103
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:58,108
Huh? I didn't notice it at the airport,

104
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:00,509
but the way it's packaged is different.

105
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:05,508
Maybe a different person packed it.

106
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:09,808
Come to think of it, you weren't at Narita Airport, were you?

107
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:13,608
No, we came from the checkpoint.

108
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:17,208
So the packages of the paintings are confirmed there?

109
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:20,708
Yes. A person who has never touched the paintings till now does.

110
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:24,108
Do the drivers change there, too?

111
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:26,309
Right, both of the drivers change.

112
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:31,508
But, if it was really stolen,

113
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:33,408
we've got to deal with it immediately.

114
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,108
But the transport company says

115
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:38,008
they're moving along as scheduled, aren't they?

116
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:41,408
But, advisor, it disappeared.

117
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:45,208
The car with "Scream" on it disappeared before my very eyes.

118
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:47,708
What about "Despair" and "Anxiety"?

119
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:49,608
They're fine.

120
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:51,108
Advisor.

121
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:53,608
If "Scream" was really stolen,

122
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:56,008
it won't be just a problem of the money involved.

123
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,009
True.

124
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,409
It could turn into an international issue.

125
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:02,208
Just one more.

126
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:04,308
So, this is "Anxiety".

127
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:06,608
I don't understand.

128
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:10,108
What? "Scream" vanished?

129
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:12,308
Keep your voice down, Sonoko.

130
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:14,908
Shouldn't you call him?

131
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:16,408
The police?

132
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:17,608
No, silly.

133
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:19,009
I mean your boyfriend.

134
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:24,009
Your finger doesn't look to be right.

135
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:27,708
You mean it was stolen?

136
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,108
I don't know.

137
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,408
But, if it was, that's bad news.

138
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,709
Besides, something bothers me.

139
00:08:37,609 --> 00:08:40,209
What on earth are you doing, Shinichi?

140
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:44,608
Dad?

141
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:47,308
If it had been stolen,

142
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:51,708
the more time it takes, the more fatal the result will be.

143
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:53,208
Advisor.

144
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,209
I think it's best to report this to the police.

145
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:58,709
Come in.

146
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:01,409
Excuse me.

147
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:07,808
I hear that there's been a problem?

148
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:11,008
I'm sorry. I happened to hear your conversation a while ago.

149
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,408
Sir, where is the driver that's transporting "Scream" now?

150
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:16,609
Advisor!

151
00:09:17,609 --> 00:09:20,708
"Scream"! "Scream" is here!

152
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:22,009
What?

153
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,208
Well?

154
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:32,808
No problem, it's genuine.

155
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:34,108
Naturally.

156
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:37,808
I was shocked when I heard that it was stolen.

157
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:41,108
But it was delayed more than 30 minutes,

158
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:43,508
anybody would be worried.

159
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:44,808
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:49,008
But it was also written in the contract

161
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:51,408
that there may be delays due to traffic conditions, too.

162
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:53,708
Of course I'm aware of that.

163
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:57,708
We just made a big thing out of it and troubled you.

164
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:01,708
Why did you go off route anyway?

165
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:04,608
We were moving along just as the navigator indicated

166
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:07,509
so we weren't aware that we went off track at all.

167
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,608
World famous masterpiece theft, my foot.

168
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:15,108
I'm apologizing, aren't I?

169
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:17,808
That's no attitude to take if apologizing.

170
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:20,109
Then, just what do you want me to do?

171
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:27,809
Kid, what are you doing?

172
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:31,908
This truck is the one that transported "Scream", right?

173
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:33,208
Right.

174
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:35,008
With me driving it.

175
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,908
You drove all the way here looking at the navigator, right?

176
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:40,108
Yes.

177
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:43,508
While following the route the company gave me.

178
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,009
Can I still see that route now?

179
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:50,109
Huh? The route is gone.

180
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:54,008
Maybe your assistant Tanaka deleted it?

181
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:57,308
Navigators keep records of the roads

182
00:10:57,309 --> 00:10:59,108
that you actually took, don't they?

183
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:00,908
Yes.

184
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:02,109
A history of the routes.

185
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:05,208
From between here to here,

186
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:07,309
it looks like you warped or something.

187
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:11,608
This is "Satellite Lost".

188
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:16,508
Car navigators receive waves from artificial satellites

189
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,208
and display their location on maps.

190
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:22,108
That's why if you move along places

191
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:25,508
where waves are out of range for a long period of time,

192
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:29,008
sometimes the route itself is not displayed.

193
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:31,409
That's what "Satellite Lost" is.

194
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:37,508
You said you changed at the checkpoint a while ago, right?

195
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:38,608
Yes.

196
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:41,008
Where was that checkpoint?

197
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:42,308
Let's see.

198
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:46,709
Just where satellite lost was around here.

199
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:50,908
Do you also take pictures at the checkpoint?

200
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:52,208
Of course.

201
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:55,608
After the package is checked whether it's okay or not.

202
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:57,308
See.

203
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:00,308
This is "Despair" and this is "Anxiety".

204
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:01,608
Where's "Scream"?

205
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:03,509
This is it.

206
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:11,408
Do you unpack the goods at the checkpoint?

207
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:12,908
No, we don't.

208
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:16,908
Then, are these packed the way they were at the airport?

209
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:19,009
Well, I guess they're the same.

210
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,308
You know,

211
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:25,908
don't you think these paintings are all of the same place?

212
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,408
Exactly.

213
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:30,608
All three paintings that have the same scenery as the background,

214
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:33,209
were drawn with the same composition.

215
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,408
Almost like a 3-panel cartoon.

216
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:39,208
Good observation.

217
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:42,808
This is indeed the "triptych" I had in mind.

218
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:44,908
Triptych?

219
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:46,608
A group of three paintings

220
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:48,708
are displayed together to mean something.

221
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:49,908
I see.

222
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:52,108
And? Did you figure anything out?

223
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:53,408
Sort of.

224
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:56,708
I wonder why that man's screaming?

225
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,709
He's not screaming.

226
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:03,008
He hears a scream so he's covering his ears.

227
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:06,308
Who's scream did he hear?

228
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:09,809
Munch explains this work in his journal.

229
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:14,408
"The sky suddenly turned bloody red.

230
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:16,208
That's when I saw

231
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:20,108
the blazing clouds cover the blue town

232
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:23,708
with blood and blades.

233
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:30,908
The tongue of blaze and blood covered the bluish black fiord and town.

234
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:36,508
I stopped in place, exhausted and leaned against a fence.

235
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:39,108
My friend walked off,

236
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,908
but I just stood in place there.

237
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:43,608
I was trembling with anxiety,

238
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:45,908
scared to my wits but battling with it.

239
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,608
That's when I heard it.

240
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:52,708
A loud endless scream pierce through nature."

241
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:59,208
It probably actually happened within Munch's troubled mind.

242
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:02,208
The perpetrator left a record on the navigator

243
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:05,509
to make it look like what truly happened never happened at all.

244
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:08,708
Hey, kids.

245
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:11,109
It's about time we get going home.

246
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:18,009
Shinichi.

247
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:21,108
Hello? Sorry.

248
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:23,908
If it's about the call a while ago, it's already okay.

249
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:27,309
You mean about Munch's "Scream" being stolen, right?

250
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:29,908
Why do you know about it?

251
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:31,508
But, sorry.

252
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,408
That was a mistake.

253
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:36,808
No, it wasn't a mistake.

254
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,809
This was a crime.

255
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,020
Everyone, thank you for taking time out to gather here.

256
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,019
Please take a good look at the photos that will be shown from now.

257
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,419
These are photos of when "Despair" and "Anxiety"

258
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,320
were packaged at Narita Airport.

259
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,219
Next is the photo of "Scream"

260
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,019
when it was packed at Haneda Airport.

261
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,119
If you take a good look,

262
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,719
you can see that "Despair" and "Anxiety" that were packed

263
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,419
at Narita Airport in a different way.

264
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,419
That's probably because the person who packed it was different.

265
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,419
Then, who packed "Despair" at Narita Airport?

266
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:29,119
"Despair" was packed by the boss and his employee.

267
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,519
"Anxiety" was packed only by the employee.

268
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Then, please look at "Scream" that was packed at Haneda Airport.

269
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,419
It's packed the same way.

270
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,420
Right.

271
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:46,319
Why were "Despair" and "Scream"

272
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,919
that were at airports distance apart packaged in the same way?

273
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,819
That's probably because the employee at Haneda

274
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,519
coincidentally happened to pack the drawing like me.

275
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,819
I see.

276
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,919
Then, the driver who transported "Scream".

277
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,119
Yes?

278
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,919
Who confirmed the package of "Scream" at the checkpoint?

279
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,819
It was President Shimamura.

280
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,419
Are you sure?

281
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,719
Yes.

282
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,119
When I came to change shifts,

283
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,719
the president was carefully checking the package.

284
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,819
What about the drivers

285
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,119
that brought the painting up to the checkpoint?

286
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,319
They seem to have gone off to their next job,

287
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,919
and weren't there anymore.

288
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
In other words,

289
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:32,519
President Shimamura was checking the package all by himself

290
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,019
until you all showed up?

291
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,519
Exactly.

292
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,019
Any problem with that?

293
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,119
It concerned me

294
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,719
when I heard that the drivers change at the checkpoint.

295
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,319
It's not such a long distance,

296
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,719
and yet the drivers change. Is it really necessary?

297
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,519
That's...

298
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,620
Now, please look at the navigator that she is holding.

299
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,019
We insisted and had a driver

300
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,819
export the data for us a while ago.

301
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,619
Will you tell us where the checkpoint was?

302
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,319
The place where there was satellite lost.

303
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,419
I see.

304
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,819
Satellite was lost.

305
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,419
In other words, the car that "Scream" was on,

306
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,920
could've gone off route just about here?

307
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,319
I was behind them and that's where I lost track of them.

308
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,019
Huh? You were behind them?

309
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,719
Hold it!

310
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,819
Something's wrong there.

311
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,519
If they went off route here,

312
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,319
they couldn't have made it to the checkpoint.

313
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,919
Just as would be expected of a great detective.

314
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,019
Exactly.

315
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,619
However, the packaging of "Scream" was checked.

316
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,219
Just what's going on?

317
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,319
In other words,

318
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,319
the checkpoint was at a location off-route to begin with.

319
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,619
What?

320
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,519
Then, will the two drivers

321
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,619
take everyone to where that checkpoint is.

322
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,720
-Huh? -Huh?

323
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,519
Conan?

324
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,219
So, you were with Shinichi after all, weren't you?

325
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,419
Where's Shinichi?

326
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,119
He left saying he had another case to take care of.

327
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,219
What?

328
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,719
He left?

329
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,919
How irresponsible can he get?

330
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,319
You can say that again.

331
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,620
After we brought everybody over to the president's house.

332
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,119
The president's house?

333
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,719
Just what on earth is going on?

334
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,419
Shinichi said

335
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,619
Pops Kogoro already knows what's going on, so to ask him.

336
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,819
Is that right, Dad?

337
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,320
Well...

338
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,019
The Sleeping Kogoro!

339
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,119
"Despair" and "Anxiety".

340
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,119
Now, the drivers who transported "Scream".

341
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,219
This is the checkpoint, correct?

342
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,019
Yes.

343
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,819
I'm sure.

344
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,019
But...

345
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,719
I had no idea it was the president's residence.

346
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
In other words,

347
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:04,419
from the airport to the museum,

348
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,919
it was the first time you took this road.

349
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,619
You probably chose those kinds of drivers to begin with, no?

350
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,420
President Shimamura!

351
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,119
You probably knew that within a certain range,

352
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,120
including where your house is located, the satellite would be lost.

353
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,019
That's why you registered the route

354
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,419
where there would be satellite lost beforehand

355
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,720
into the navigator.

356
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,219
If you set it so that once they reached the destination

357
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,719
it would automatically delete,

358
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,420
there would be no evidence left either.

359
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,819
The only thing left would be the record of satellite lost.

360
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,319
That's how the president opened the package of "Scream" here

361
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,219
and repacked it.

362
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,119
That's why the packing method was the same.

363
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,719
But, why did you do something like this?

364
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,520
That's because...

365
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,719
Mr. Shimamura, delivery.

366
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,020
What is it?

367
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,520
Mr. Shimamura!

368
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,519
Mr. Shimamura, I'm sorry.

369
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,720
I accepted it and opened it.

370
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,620
What?

371
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,120
I'm sorry.

372
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,719
I see.

373
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,419
You unpacked it to take a picture of this.

374
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,419
I love Munch.

375
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,319
Especially "Scream".

376
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,719
That's why when I got this job to transport the real "Scream",

377
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,719
I couldn't suppress the urge to hang it in my house

378
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,120
and take a picture of it.

379
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,619
But this is a grave issue.

380
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,219
I'm very sorry!

381
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,019
This is really no good, president.

382
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,119
This is apparently a criminal case.

383
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,619
Let's report this.

384
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,919
Hold it.

385
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,519
President Shimamura.

386
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,419
The picture that is on the wall behind you.

387
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,619
That picture of the sunflower, what is it?

388
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:37,019
This is the first sunflower that Gogh drew in Arles.

389
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,019
I used to work in the States when I was young.

390
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,819
I was allowed to take this photo

391
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,119
as thanks for transporting the work.

392
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,419
In other words, you know the person

393
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,619
who owns that sunflower painting.

394
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,119
Yes.

395
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,119
I'm still on a friendly terms.

396
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,319
All right, then.

397
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,119
I am soon going to be collecting

398
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,119
Gogh's Sunflowers scattered throughout the world,

399
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,119
and open a exhibition of the six sunflower paintings.

400
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,919
Therefore, when I hold this event,

401
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,319
I would like you to ask the owner

402
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,319
to borrow it to me.

403
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,519
If you grant me my wish,

404
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,219
I will not make an issue of the insolent action

405
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,219
that you have taken this time.

406
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,519
Yes, sir.

407
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,919
I'll be glad to.

408
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,720
Case closed!

409
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,719
That Sunflower exhibition of the six sunflowers

410
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,319
is going to be held in Japan

411
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,919
as "Sunflowers Long for Japan Exhibition".

412
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,720
But we'll get to that some time later.

413
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,219
"Next Episode" -Hello? Hello?

414
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,820
Mouri, answer me! Mouri!

415
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,120
It seems definite that Pops was here.

416
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,320
Police! Nobody move!

417
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,620
That blueprint was the escape route after all.

418
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,119
Next Conan,

419
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,020
"The Great Detective is Manipulated (Part 1)"
