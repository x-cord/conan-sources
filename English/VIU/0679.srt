1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,370
A mystery drama staged in Nagasaki

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,970
in the days of the end of the Edo era,

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,470
in which Ryoma Sakamoto acts as a detective.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,070
The scriptwriter who is in the midst of writing the scenario for the drama,

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,270
"Kosaku Tatsumi (45), Scriptwriter" -Kosaku Tatsumi, suddenly disappears,

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:18,770
and Pops is asked to deduce the culprit of this incomplete script is.

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,170
When we investigate Mr. Tatsumi's room,

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,370
we find hidden in the closet

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,070
many clippings of the band of thieves that stole artworks.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,270
There must be something lurking behind.

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,670
Just then, the continuation of the scenario

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,270
is received by mail from Mr. Tatsumi whose whereabouts is unknown.

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,870
In this script, a second murder occurs,

14
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,470
and a character called Otei of Miuraya, who was not scheduled to appear

15
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,670
makes an appearance.

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,670
Then, to our surprise, Ran ends up acting the role of Otei.

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,870
And because of this, I end up dressing up like this too.

18
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,970
But, Otei turns out to have several strange dialogs.

19
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,970
And only the fonts of her lines were different from the rest.

20
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,170
Could this be a message from Mr. Tatsumi?

21
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,270
Just then, an incident occurs.

22
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,170
Mr. Sakota in charge of small props

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,970
is attacked by someone.

24
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,470
What?

25
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,370
Ran?

26
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,270
Ran's the culprit?

27
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,170
The vivid colored memories of summer

28
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,270
solve mysteries all season round.

29
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,270
Can the end of the Edo Era drama be completed?

30
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,470
The hidden behind the hidden.

31
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,170
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,070
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,370
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,510
"The Nagasaki Mystery (The Present)".

35
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,010
Because the wounds on Mr. Sakota's face

36
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,910
"Kazuomi Sakota (35), Props Master" -was from being punched,

37
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,010
the Nagasaki Prefectural Police Office,

38
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,910
took Ran in as a prime suspect,

39
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,810
and interrogated her because she owned a black belt in Karate.

40
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,210
I don't know!

41
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,110
At that time, I was alone trying to memorize my lines.

42
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,210
Is there anyone who can prove that for you?

43
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,610
Prove...

44
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,310
Something yellow seems to have passed across me.

45
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,010
What was that?

46
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,510
No good. I can't remember.

47
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,310
Ran was memorizing her lines just about here.

48
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,310
Talk about yellow... The only thing in sight are these flowers.

49
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,210
I need to find an eye-witness, after all.

50
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,510
Back at the time when the incident occurred,

51
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,210
I had no choice but to find a person who had witnessed Ran there.

52
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,610
What's this?

53
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,310
"Statue of Puccini" -Puccini, the composer of the opera "Madame Butterfly".

54
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,510
And...

55
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,610
"Statue of Tamaki Miura" -this is Tamaki Miura,

56
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,210
the heroine who acted as Madame Butterfly.

57
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,810
Miura?

58
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,810
I wonder if it has anything to do

59
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,710
with the part Ran is playing, "Otei of Miuraya"?

60
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,010
Mr. Sakota loved opera too.

61
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,110
Of the Japanese actresses who played the role of Madame Butterfly,

62
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,610
other than Ms. Tamaki Miura,

63
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,510
Ms. Teiko Kiwa was also famous.

64
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,710
Tamaki Miura and Teiko Kiwa.

65
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,610
Otei of Miuraya!

66
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,710
"Shimizu (68), Nagasaki Saruku/ Guide" -Let's move on then, shall we?

67
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,910
Yellow...

68
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,510
Sir.

69
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,310
Have you seen her?

70
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,610
Yeah. I remember seeing her.

71
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,910
If it's that girl,

72
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,110
I saw her sitting at the bench reading something right through.

73
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,310
Thanks to the testimony of the guide, Mr. Shimizu,

74
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,510
Ran was cleared of suspicion.

75
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,210
But I wonder why Mr. Sakota pointed at Ran back then.

76
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,410
Well, we've got a problem.

77
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,810
I heard from the officer just now

78
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,010
that a person who resembled Tatsumi was witnessed near here!

79
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,010
-What? -What?

80
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,310
Oh, no.

81
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,710
Really?

82
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,010
"Taizo Ooki (52)" -It seems that he ran off after a scream

83
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,710
"Producer of a drama production company" -was heard from the parking lot.

84
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,910
"Futaba Nanao (23) as Ine Karasuma" -That's a lie!

85
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,710
"Ryuhei Kishimura (30), Assistant Director" -Mr. Tatsumi would never...

86
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,410
It's definitely a lie!

87
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,210
Do you know anything?

88
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,310
No.

89
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,010
I just know that Mr. Tatsumi who writes such wonderful scripts

90
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,910
would never do a thing like that.

91
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,410
"Keisuke Sakakibara (45), TV Drama Director" -Leave the case to the police.

92
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,810
"Akikazu Nakane (48), Cameraman" -More than that, Mr. Mouri,

93
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,010
what about the culprit in the drama?

94
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,710
Well, as to that...

95
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,510
Hey, I wonder why Mr. Sakota was in this parking lot.

96
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,710
It was still too early to get ready to go home, right?

97
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,110
The continuation of the script came,

98
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,710
so there was still a lot more to do and yet,

99
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,310
why would he secretly flee off like that?

100
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,110
Flee?

101
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,810
I see!

102
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,710
Mr. Sakota read the script,

103
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,910
found out that he was in danger and fled?

104
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,610
In other words, are you saying that Tatsumi,

105
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,410
who supposed that Sakota would be attacked,

106
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,610
secretly hid a message in the script?

107
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,510
That's probably included in the dying message, "Kyu" (nine)!

108
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,110
"Kyu"... What on earth does it mean?

109
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,310
Well, it indicates you,

110
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,610
Ms. Futaba Nanao!

111
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,610
What?

112
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,610
-What? -What?

113
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,310
No way.

114
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,010
But, why?

115
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,210
"Futaba Nanao" -It's simple addition.

116
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,710
"Nana: 7" -If you add the number seven, in the name Nanao

117
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,110
"Futa: 2" -and the number two in the name Futaba, you get a sum of nine.

118
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,110
In other words,

119
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,410
the message meant, Futaba is after you, so be careful!

120
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,910
No... no way.

121
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,310
Then, why did you offer to be our guide of your own initiative?

122
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,510
Wasn't it because you wanted to find Mr. Tatsumi before anyone else did,

123
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,010
and shut him up as you did Mr. Sakota?

124
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,610
No!

125
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,010
I was just merely worried about Mr. Tatsumi.

126
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,310
"Benichiyo Yamashita (42) as Tsuru" -What forced logic

127
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,310
to say that seven plus two equals nine.

128
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,310
It's sundown already,

129
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,710
so I'm calling it a day.

130
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,810
You can't do that.

131
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,410
I guess it can't be helped, let's call it a day then.

132
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,510
What's wrong, Ooki?

133
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,810
Hey, Bara, I just remembered

134
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,010
Ochiyo was known as an action actress in her younger days, wasn't she?

135
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,510
Really?

136
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,810
Come to think of it, she used to practice Chinese martial arts too.

137
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,810
You could also say the same about Cho who used to act as a boxer.

138
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,610
"Chojiro Sazanami (45) as Chyubei Soneya" -Give me a break,

139
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,210
"Kyonosuke Sasahara (33) as Ryoma Sakamoto" -it's been 20 years already.

140
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,010
Give me a break too,

141
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,010
with suspects popping up one after the other...

142
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,110
Moreover, all of you are actors.

143
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,810
Last night Andrew mentioned that

144
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,010
Tatsumi unlike the historical fact,

145
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,610
didn't like Glover and Tsuru being married,

146
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,610
-but is that true? -No, not really.

147
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,910
Because Tatsumi's the one who suggested to marry the two.

148
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,010
"Andrew Hatta (50) as Glover" -Is that true?

149
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,510
Yeah, although that's something that he would rarely do.

150
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,910
Where are you now?

151
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,510
I was just about to leave.

152
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,910
Yes, that's right.

153
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,610
Yeah, but...

154
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,210
Please do something about it, I beg you!

155
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,110
"The Nagasaki Ropeway"

156
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,910
How beautiful.

157
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,210
-Nice, isn't it? -Fantastic!

158
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,510
"Mt. Inasa, The peak"

159
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,110
Mr. Sazanami was attacked?

160
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,010
The police called just now.

161
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,010
The place is at the observatory of Mt. Inasa.

162
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,810
Why'd he go to a place like that?

163
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,410
"Treatment Room" -I wanted to see

164
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,810
the world widely famous night scenery of Nagasaki.

165
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,210
Then, I was suddenly attacked by someone there.

166
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,010
As to that, I think I tore the strap off when I was struggling.

167
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,610
It seems that Tatsumi's fingerprints were detected from that strap.

168
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,110
Strap? What kind?

169
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,210
One with a silver heart on it.

170
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,210
A silver heart...

171
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,210
Don't tell me that...

172
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,310
Okay, please be quiet!

173
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,210
Please don't look towards the camera, okay?

174
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,610
-Okay! Okay!

175
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,810
Why do I have to do something like this too?

176
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,910
Conan is cute, isn't he?

177
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,510
I told you I know!

178
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,710
He's been...

179
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,910
Ready... Start!

180
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,010
Cut!

181
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,310
Hey, hey, the writing order isn't correct.

182
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,910
I'll rewind it.

183
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,910
The first stroke is not this, but the "no" part!

184
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,510
If I remember correctly,

185
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,010
that too was...

186
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,210
As to that...

187
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,510
See, the image was attached to the script,

188
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,710
saying to make it exactly like this.

189
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,310
Just as I thought.

190
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,910
"Ask Otei of Miuraya".

191
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,610
"Figures are important".

192
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,010
"Figures will solve everything".

193
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,510
Tamaki Miura and Teiko Kiwa who acted as Madame Butterfly...

194
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,810
The stroke of the kanji character "kyu" written in wrong order.

195
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,510
Madame Butterfly... Butterfly...

196
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,410
I see! I got it!

197
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,510
The meaning of the dying message!

198
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,710
In Nakashima River, a monster resides.

199
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,310
Its weak point is

200
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,910
the second tooth from the left of the lower jaw.

201
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,310
-Sorry. -Conan, do that, won't you?

202
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,610
With your glasses.

203
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,910
-Like this? -Yup, right, right.

204
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,410
So, that's the story.

205
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,310
I found it!

206
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,610
A mail's come from Mr. Tatsumi!

207
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,010
It says he'll hand over

208
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,610
the remainder of the script at Oshirasu so to come there!

209
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,810
Oshirasu?

210
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,510
-What? -What?

211
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:47,453
"Nagasaki Museum of History and Culture"

212
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:49,453
You received mail from Mr. Tatsumi?

213
00:11:49,453 --> 00:11:51,453
-Is that true? -Yes.

214
00:11:51,748 --> 00:11:54,748
It says that he would hand over the remainder of the script here.

215
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:58,748
"Oshirasu Theater" -This is a theater where performances are staged?

216
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:05,048
Is your wound okay?

217
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:07,248
Yeah, it's no big deal.

218
00:12:09,748 --> 00:12:12,048
Tatsumi's not here yet?

219
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:13,948
The actors are all here.

220
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:17,148
Before Mr. Tatsumi arrives...

221
00:12:17,148 --> 00:12:21,648
I, Kogoro Mouri will disclose the culprit of the real case,

222
00:12:21,648 --> 00:12:24,848
the one who attacked Mr. Sakota and Mr. Sazanami!

223
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:28,548
Are you saying that it's not Mr. Tatsumi?

224
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,848
But, I thought Tatsumi's fingerprints were found on the strap.

225
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:36,048
That indeed is the trap that the culprit set up using the strap!

226
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,748
The culprit is...

227
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:41,448
you, Mr. Kyonosuke Sasahara!

228
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:42,748
Me?

229
00:12:42,748 --> 00:12:44,448
There are many people in the staff and cast here

230
00:12:44,448 --> 00:12:47,648
that have numbers included in their names.

231
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:50,648
That goes for you too, Mr. Sasahara.

232
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:52,948
Where, in my name is it?

233
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:54,948
The kanji character of your name Kyonosuke,

234
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:58,248
can also be read, Kei (quadrillion), which indicates the unit of numbers!

235
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:00,048
So what?

236
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:03,548
Even the dying message in the script was a number!

237
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:06,448
So, what if it was?

238
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:08,248
Well, you see...

239
00:13:10,348 --> 00:13:14,048
You were calling somewhere right through, weren't you?

240
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:16,848
And, it seems you were arguing about something!

241
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:19,148
Well, that's...

242
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:23,248
I'll bet you were arguing with none other Mr. Tatsumi, no?

243
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:25,248
Wrong! That was...

244
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:36,748
I'll tell you the truth already!

245
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:39,048
I was arguing with the office!

246
00:13:40,348 --> 00:13:41,648
The fact is...

247
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:44,748
I have a wife and child.

248
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:46,748
Oh, that's new news.

249
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:47,748
But, I thought you were single

250
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:50,648
and always ranked on the top of being the most wanted as a boyfriend.

251
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:53,948
And, a photo shots magazine got hold of this info,

252
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:55,248
so I was pleading with the office

253
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:58,448
to keep this hidden at all cost, because being single was what I went on.

254
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:00,348
"TMS Production" -See!

255
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:04,548
I see.

256
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:06,048
Then, you, Benichiyo!

257
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:11,048
You were out the night that Mr. Sazanami was attacked, weren't you?

258
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:13,148
Are you going to suspect me next?

259
00:14:13,148 --> 00:14:15,048
Where on earth were you?

260
00:14:15,048 --> 00:14:16,548
Do I have to answer?

261
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:18,348
Don't tell me that's you, Ochiyo?

262
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:20,748
Like, you were eating Turkish Rice?

263
00:14:24,248 --> 00:14:25,748
"Kitchen Seiji"

264
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:27,948
"Turkish Rice" -Bull's eye.

265
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:32,248
In fact, I'm on a diet for my next job.

266
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:37,348
But, I just couldn't keep from eating the famed Turkish Rice of Nagasaki.

267
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:39,248
So, then who's the culprit...

268
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:42,348
I'm spinning...

269
00:14:44,148 --> 00:14:45,548
Excuse me,

270
00:14:45,548 --> 00:14:48,248
I will start the real show from now.

271
00:14:48,248 --> 00:14:50,948
So this is the famous Sleeping Kogoro!

272
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:53,348
-Roll the cameras! -Okay!

273
00:14:53,348 --> 00:14:55,748
The fact is, the letter that you received from Mr. Tatsumi this morning

274
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:57,848
is what I prepared.

275
00:14:57,848 --> 00:14:59,748
What?

276
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:03,748
In order to indict the culprit who attacked Mr. Sakota and Mr. Sazanami.

277
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:07,248
That culprit is...

278
00:15:07,248 --> 00:15:08,848
Ran, you!

279
00:15:08,848 --> 00:15:10,348
-What? -What?

280
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:12,048
No!

281
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:13,748
She did?

282
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,448
Hey, Dad...

283
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,448
Cool it and listen, Ran.

284
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:20,248
The second murder that was written in the script,

285
00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:22,748
what was the dying message?

286
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:24,948
Like I said, it was the kanji character, "kyu".

287
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:26,348
Right.

288
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:29,048
But, the order in which the stroke was written was incorrect.

289
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:32,348
You can tell by checking the traces of what was written on the soil.

290
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,448
In other words,

291
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:35,848
the dying message was not "Kyu"

292
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:37,948
but rather written in hiragana, "Tei"!

293
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:39,548
"Tei"?

294
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:40,848
In other words, Ran,

295
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:44,448
it's indicating the role that you acted of Otei of Miuraya!

296
00:15:45,348 --> 00:15:48,048
Of course, it's only what happened in the drama.

297
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,148
However, I think that Mr. Tatsumi's script,

298
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:55,548
while fictitious is pointing to some actual case and accusing it.

299
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:57,348
An actual case?

300
00:15:57,348 --> 00:15:59,648
Please take a good look at the script.

301
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:03,248
Only certain dialogs are written in different fonts.

302
00:16:03,248 --> 00:16:06,248
And if that is the message sent from Mr. Tatsumi...

303
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,448
First, for Otei's dialog.

304
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:11,548
Figures are important.

305
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:13,648
Figures will solve everything.

306
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:16,048
With this dialog and dying message,

307
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:19,548
Mr. Tatsumi tried to express a word that has to do with a figure

308
00:16:19,548 --> 00:16:22,848
that is included in a certain person's name.

309
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,048
Besides...

310
00:16:28,348 --> 00:16:31,848
That was the included in Mr. Chojiro Sazanami's name.

311
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:33,448
"Cho"

312
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:35,448
No.

313
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:37,148
It can't be!

314
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:38,448
Mr. Sazanami?

315
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:41,248
Just... just what're you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

316
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:45,648
I'm saying that the culprit for the series of incidents is you.

317
00:16:45,648 --> 00:16:46,948
Wait!

318
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:50,348
Don't you write Cho with "Chi" instead of "Tei"?

319
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:52,048
That's right!

320
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:54,148
In the hiragana of olden days Japan,

321
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:56,948
they wrote "chocho" (butterfly) as "Teifuteifu".

322
00:16:56,948 --> 00:16:59,948
Why all of a sudden does the hiragana "chocho" appear?

323
00:16:59,948 --> 00:17:02,248
That's because Mr. Tatsumi's message

324
00:17:02,248 --> 00:17:05,448
is greatly connected with Madame Butterfly.

325
00:17:06,448 --> 00:17:10,448
Ask the daughter of the shipping agency Miuraya, Otei,

326
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:12,548
for the details.

327
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:15,348
The font for this dialog is also different.

328
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:17,348
If Otei of Miuraya

329
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:19,448
"Tamaki Miura, Teiko Kiwa" -refers to Ms. Tamaki Miura and Ms. Teiko Kiwa,

330
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:24,148
who acted out Madame Butterfly of the opera,

331
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:26,948
Otei would connect to Madame Butterfly.

332
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:28,848
In other words, the dying message

333
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,348
is pointing out "tei" from the word "Teifuteifu"!

334
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:33,148
I see!

335
00:17:33,148 --> 00:17:35,048
That... that's forced logic!

336
00:17:35,048 --> 00:17:36,848
There is a saying that Madame Butterfly

337
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:40,148
was maybe modeled after Glover's wife, Tsuru.

338
00:17:41,248 --> 00:17:42,848
The reason why Mr. Tatsumi, despite changing the fact of history,

339
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:45,048
created the character Tsuru, who appeared in the drama

340
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:48,248
was a hidden advanced hint to the dying message!

341
00:17:48,248 --> 00:17:51,848
In other words, Tatsumi to begin with, in this script,

342
00:17:51,848 --> 00:17:54,548
had been trying to indict Cho?

343
00:17:54,548 --> 00:17:55,748
Probably.

344
00:17:55,748 --> 00:17:59,248
But the incident occurred after that, you know?

345
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:03,148
Mr. Tatsumi was trying to indict another case.

346
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,748
Another case?

347
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:08,248
Mr. Sakota, who likes opera, was the only one who realized it.

348
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:10,548
Before I solved the mystery,

349
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,748
he tried to flee

350
00:18:12,748 --> 00:18:14,548
and was attacked by you.

351
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:17,448
Mr. Sakota pointed at Ran

352
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:22,748
because Otei was a character who was created to indict Mr. Sazanami.

353
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:24,148
Please wait.

354
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:27,048
Are you saying that the two were into something together?

355
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:29,348
-Conan! -Yes!

356
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:34,248
This is what was in Tatsumi's room.

357
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:37,148
Don't tell me they were involved in this!

358
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:38,548
You gotta be kidding!

359
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:41,648
I was attacked by Tatsumi after that, you know!

360
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:44,848
You acted all of that out yourself,

361
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:47,448
in order to put all the blame on Mr. Tatsumi.

362
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:48,748
What?

363
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:50,448
How ruthless!

364
00:18:50,448 --> 00:18:52,348
It... it's all baloney!

365
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:53,748
I have no choice.

366
00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:56,048
I'll show you conclusive evidence, then.

367
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:57,348
Huh?

368
00:18:57,348 --> 00:18:59,548
"A monster resides in the Nakashima River".

369
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:02,548
Do you remember that dialog of Otei?

370
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:03,548
Conan!

371
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:07,648
This is the identity of the monster!

372
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,248
Monster?

373
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,048
That's Megane Bridge.

374
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:13,648
But if you do this...

375
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:19,748
See, it looks like a monster, doesn't it?

376
00:19:19,748 --> 00:19:20,948
True!

377
00:19:20,948 --> 00:19:21,948
That's why,

378
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:23,048
"The weak point of the monster

379
00:19:23,048 --> 00:19:26,148
is the second tooth from the left on the lower jaw".

380
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:28,748
I think it's referring to this stepping stone.

381
00:19:28,748 --> 00:19:30,548
Since Pops told me to,

382
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:32,948
I found this over there last night.

383
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:35,148
This micro SD.

384
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:38,948
Sir! Will you please check what's in here?

385
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:40,248
Okay.

386
00:19:40,248 --> 00:19:41,948
We won't use this small prop anymore,

387
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,248
so let's put it in here.

388
00:19:44,248 --> 00:19:46,648
We'll make millions with this again.

389
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:48,948
This is...

390
00:19:48,948 --> 00:19:50,348
As you can see,

391
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:51,448
they hid the artworks that they stole

392
00:19:51,448 --> 00:19:54,548
in the small props used for filming and transported them,

393
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:55,648
and were selling them off secretly

394
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:57,448
to the rich and collectors whenever they went on locations.

395
00:19:57,448 --> 00:19:59,948
This is recorded proof of what they were doing.

396
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:04,348
Mr. Tatsumi tried to indict them in the script of this drama

397
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:08,348
but sensed that his life was in danger and disappeared.

398
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:11,148
But, after finding that you appeared,

399
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:12,448
he secretly embedded a hint

400
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:15,948
in the continuation of the script and sent it over?

401
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,948
Sleeping Kogoro, please solve this riddle for me!

402
00:20:20,748 --> 00:20:22,248
It's just like him.

403
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:25,048
And, where is Mr. Tatsumi?

404
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:26,748
As to his whereabouts,

405
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:28,948
Mr. Sazanami should know.

406
00:20:29,948 --> 00:20:32,648
No... I don't. Why would I?

407
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,248
Please tell me! Where's Mr. Tatsumi?

408
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:37,848
Where's Kosaku?

409
00:20:40,148 --> 00:20:43,248
You can't get away with this, Mr. Sazanami.

410
00:20:43,248 --> 00:20:46,148
The one who had Mr. Tatsumi's strap

411
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:49,548
was none other than you!

412
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:56,548
Futaba, don't tell me that maybe you're...

413
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,248
With Tatsumi?

414
00:20:59,248 --> 00:21:00,648
Yes.

415
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:03,048
You offered to help me

416
00:21:03,048 --> 00:21:06,748
all because you wanted to save your beloved Mr. Tatsumi.

417
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:08,848
Is that so?

418
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:12,348
But we weren't allowed to have love affairs at the office

419
00:21:12,348 --> 00:21:15,648
and had to keep it a secret at all costs.

420
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:17,348
I'm very sorry.

421
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:23,348
But, with all the evidence he had on him,

422
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,048
I wonder why Mr. Tatsumi didn't go to the police.

423
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:28,748
He probably wanted them to turn themselves in.

424
00:21:28,748 --> 00:21:31,648
In this drama, where all old colleagues got together,

425
00:21:31,648 --> 00:21:34,648
I think he wanted to get Sazanami back on the right track.

426
00:21:34,648 --> 00:21:36,748
Kosaku!

427
00:21:36,748 --> 00:21:37,948
Futaba!

428
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,048
Mr. Sakota who was in ICU regained consciousness,

429
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:09,248
and from his testimony, everything was substantiated.

430
00:23:09,248 --> 00:23:12,048
The band of thieves responsible for stealing artworks that are behind them,

431
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:14,348
would also eventually be arrested.

432
00:23:14,348 --> 00:23:16,748
Filming of the drama was resumed.

433
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:19,048
Of course,

434
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:22,948
after the scenes where Mr. Sazanami, Ran and I were to appear were deleted,

435
00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:27,348
a new script was written at great speed by Mr. Tatsumi.

436
00:23:31,648 --> 00:23:33,048
As to the relationship of the two,

437
00:23:33,048 --> 00:23:36,548
the office approved of it, I hear.

438
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,248
I'm happy to hear that!

439
00:23:38,248 --> 00:23:39,948
Hey, did you know?

440
00:23:39,948 --> 00:23:42,248
When Nagasaki is written in English,

441
00:23:42,248 --> 00:23:45,048
the alphabet "I" (love) comes at the end!

442
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,248
Like those two!

443
00:23:53,848 --> 00:23:56,548
"Next Episode" -So, this is the rumored cactus?

444
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:00,848
Uncle?

445
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:04,448
Gosh. I sure run into you kids a lot at the scenes of crimes.

446
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:06,248
Big brother, so, just as I thought...

447
00:24:06,248 --> 00:24:07,948
Wrong! I didn't do it!

448
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,848
I see, so that's the story.

449
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:13,748
If so, the culprit is...

450
00:24:13,748 --> 00:24:16,948
I figured everything out with that alarm just now!

451
00:24:16,948 --> 00:24:18,248
What did you say?

452
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,848
Next Conan,

453
00:24:19,848 --> 00:24:22,148
"Cactus Rhapsody".
