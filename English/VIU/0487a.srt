"Police Department"

2
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,898
But was that really true,

3
00:00:32,898 --> 00:00:34,298
what you said before?

4
00:01:33,898 --> 00:01:36,398
"First Investigation Division"

5
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,798
That's definitely what he said.

6
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:41,198
Maybe he's mistaken.

7
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:44,298
In that case...

8
00:01:46,498 --> 00:01:47,598
She's here.

9
00:01:58,498 --> 00:02:02,298
The three suspects Suwa, Yoshioka, Asai...

10
00:02:02,298 --> 00:02:05,098
There's a possibility that there're other accomplices?

11
00:02:13,998 --> 00:02:15,098
What?

12
00:02:20,398 --> 00:02:22,798
Is anything on my face?

13
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:27,598
What is it?

14
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:31,598
Excuse me.

15
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:32,598
It's nothing.

16
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:34,598
What on earth?

17
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:37,198
What're you all doing looking at me

18
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,298
and whispering away?

19
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:41,598
No, it's nothing.

20
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:42,998
Right?

21
00:02:42,998 --> 00:02:44,198
Yes.

22
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,898
No, it's nothing.

23
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:53,398
No. It's nothing. Right?

24
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:54,998
Don't worry about it.

25
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:01,398
Really?

26
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:04,898
Yes.

27
00:03:10,698 --> 00:03:14,498
Questioning of the victims of the Haidocho case is done.

28
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:18,598
Yes...

29
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,998
As to that case...

30
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:23,998
Give me a break.

31
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,398
I'm amazing, don't you agree?

32
00:03:30,398 --> 00:03:31,998
Really.

33
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:35,498
I mean, talk about spitting it out!

34
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:40,598
It was like a scene from a drama.

35
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:44,098
He says he wants to eat pork cutlet and stuff.

36
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,398
What...

37
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:49,598
Takagi...

38
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:51,898
What... what's wrong?

39
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,398
What do you mean by that?

40
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:58,098
Why didn't you tell us what was going on too?

41
00:03:58,098 --> 00:03:59,998
Right, Takagi!

42
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:02,098
You know,

43
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:05,598
we've got to prepare our hearts for it too, Takagi!

44
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,298
What? Prepare your hearts?

45
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:10,698
What is this preparing your hearts about?

46
00:04:10,698 --> 00:04:13,098
Ta... Takagi!

47
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:14,598
Enough.

48
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:16,798
So, Takagi...

49
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,398
Yes?

50
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:20,898
It's you, isn't it?

51
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:25,898
You mean the case the Inspector Megure is talking about on the phone?

52
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,398
Officer Takagi.

53
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:29,698
You can be very funny!

54
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:31,798
About Officer Sato...

55
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:35,198
Yes.

56
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:36,198
You see,

57
00:04:36,198 --> 00:04:38,298
the stuff that's glittering on Officer Sato's finger...

58
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:43,198
Ran, what's up?

59
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:44,998
That ring...

60
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:46,698
The ring.

61
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:50,098
Ring?

62
00:04:50,098 --> 00:04:51,498
Ring.

63
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:55,898
You're right.

64
00:04:55,898 --> 00:04:58,298
The ring...

65
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,698
What? Ring?

66
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:03,398
It's a ring I've never seen before.

67
00:05:03,398 --> 00:05:06,098
Moreover, he's wearing it on her left ring finger?

68
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,198
Who... who on earth did she get it from?

69
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:12,498
Cool it, cool head!

70
00:05:12,498 --> 00:05:15,498
What's needed is composure. Calm down.

71
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:17,298
I'll ask Officer Sato about it.

72
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:22,198
Excuse me, Officer Sato. That ring...

73
00:05:24,398 --> 00:05:25,998
Sorry.

74
00:05:25,998 --> 00:05:28,398
I've found somebody I like.

75
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:30,098
Miwa.

76
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:31,698
Ms. Sato.

77
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,698
Miwa.

78
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:37,098
What's going on?

79
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:40,098
Wearing it on her left ring finger means...

80
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:41,398
She's engaged?

81
00:05:41,398 --> 00:05:43,998
That's what it means, isn't it? Hey!

82
00:05:43,998 --> 00:05:47,098
I'd sure like to know what it means.

83
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:48,098
What?

84
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,198
You mean that ring isn't what you gave her?

85
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:52,198
No.

86
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:55,298
I didn't buy it, nor have I seen it ever before.

87
00:05:55,298 --> 00:05:57,498
Then who on earth?

88
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:16,998
Tozawa of the patrol division.

89
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:18,698
Sonenaga of the crime prevention division.

90
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:21,098
Taniguchi of the traffic and transportation division.

91
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:23,398
I'm sorry. Could you hold a moment, please?

92
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:24,498
Hey!

93
00:06:25,798 --> 00:06:26,798
Hey!

94
00:06:26,798 --> 00:06:29,298
Be quiet, will you?

95
00:06:29,298 --> 00:06:31,098
Please.

96
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:32,498
Hello.

97
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:34,598
I'm sorry. And then?

98
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:38,098
What?

99
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,398
Someone is...

100
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,598
Someone is dead?

101
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:50,298
I got it, Ran.

102
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:51,798
I'll be right over.

103
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:55,898
Officer Takagi! Let's go!

104
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:57,098
What?

105
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:59,198
There was a murder at a villa in Okutama!

106
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:00,498
Officer Takagi!

107
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:01,498
Yes, sir!

108
00:07:01,498 --> 00:07:04,198
I'm sorry, but could you take this?

109
00:07:04,198 --> 00:07:06,098
I would rather...

110
00:07:08,498 --> 00:07:10,498
I've got no choice, though.

111
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:13,098
I've got my own problems, you know.

112
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,098
It's a big problem!

113
00:07:26,698 --> 00:07:28,498
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

114
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:30,798
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

115
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:33,598
A ring glitters on Officer Sato's left hand.

116
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:35,398
Did Officer Takagi finally do it?

117
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:36,798
He sees through the one and only truth.

118
00:07:36,798 --> 00:07:38,598
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

123
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:46,006
Look at the number of stones on it. Fabulous.

124
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:48,106
Are they all diamonds?

125
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,606
I've never seen anything like this before.

126
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:54,406
That's right.

127
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:55,806
It's a ring that I had custom made

128
00:09:55,806 --> 00:09:58,206
in memory of my 100th piece of work.

129
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:01,306
It says "100th" on the back.

130
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:03,606
"100th" -See.

"Mystery Author" -100 diamonds on the ring,

133
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:08,906
but they told me that doing so

134
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:11,006
would make the ring larger than a finger shield,

135
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:12,906
so they were against it.

136
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:18,106
I guess so.

137
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:23,406
Excuse me.

138
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,106
I'd like to switch the tape.

139
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:28,306

143
00:10:35,106 --> 00:10:37,206
but I for some reason don't feel comfortable

144
00:10:37,206 --> 00:10:39,906
unless I see the tape spinning.

145
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:42,306
In digital recording,

146
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:45,306
errors are a problem too.

147
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:47,106
I see.

148
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:49,006
In fact, I feel the same, too.

but I just can't seem to let go of this old analogue camera

152
00:10:58,706 --> 00:11:00,506
that I've been using from before.

153
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:03,806
Well, the only thing is, with this you can't see

00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:05,506
how the pictures come out right away.

Hey, hey.

I'm sorry I have to intrude on you

and finish what you got to do.

163

Come on, cool head, Ms. Anabuki.

164

have him rest well

00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:48,506
this is like an introductory rehearsal.

173
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:53,206
On this month's preview page...

174
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:56,306
See! There's a big ad that goes,

175
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:58,006
"Writer Masutaka Moroguchi will have a talk out

176
00:11:58,006 --> 00:12:01,006
with famed Detective Kogoro Mouri,

177
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:03,206
on the new dawn of mystery stories!"

178
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:04,806
Please take a look at it.

179
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:07,206
Let's see.

180
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:12,106
What's the matter?

181
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,906
You look puzzled.

182
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:19,206
I just felt that he wasn't the kind of person I thought he was.

183
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:22,506
By that, do you mean Mr. Moroguchi?

184
00:12:24,306 --> 00:12:27,306
Because his mystery story here

185
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:30,206
is particular about little details.

186
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:32,406
I was sure that he would be a nervous person

187
00:12:32,406 --> 00:12:35,506
who is always annoyed.

188
00:12:38,706 --> 00:12:40,106
Ms. Anabuki!

189
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:42,306
Yes?

190
00:12:42,306 --> 00:12:45,006
Do you have a ruler?

191
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:46,106
Yes.

192
00:12:46,106 --> 00:12:48,106
I have a tape measure with me.

193
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,506
Just as I thought.

194
00:12:56,306 --> 00:12:57,606
The font of my name

195
00:12:57,606 --> 00:13:01,106
is 1 mm smaller than that of the other writers!

196
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:03,206
Are you trying to humiliate me or something?

197
00:13:03,206 --> 00:13:05,006
No... no way.

198
00:13:05,006 --> 00:13:07,506
It's only that a font that size looks nicer

199
00:13:07,506 --> 00:13:09,206
and fits in much nicer, that's why.

200
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,306
Then,

201
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:12,906
why not make the fonts of the other writers smaller?

202
00:13:14,106 --> 00:13:16,006
You good-for-nothing!

203
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:21,706
I'm sorry.

204
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:24,606
I'll make sure that nothing like this happens again.

205
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:26,106
Phooey! You'd better!

206
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,606
I see.

207
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,706
I guess he's nervous about everything else.

208
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:32,006
Really.

209
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:36,706
Mr. Akiba, the editor in charge before you was great.

210
00:13:36,706 --> 00:13:39,606
He granted my every wish.

211
00:13:41,306 --> 00:13:43,906
He must've been a capable editor.

212
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:47,006
From looking for image data

213
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:51,106
to investigating specialized knowledge regarding tricks...

214
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:55,106
He spared no pains at serving me.

215
00:13:56,906 --> 00:14:00,506
I mean, until his life ran out on him.

216
00:14:05,306 --> 00:14:08,606
Did... did he die?

217
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:13,206
This spring, he found dead at home

218
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:17,206
in a room that was completely locked.

219
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:20,406
Locked room?

220
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:22,206
Did he commit suicide?

221
00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:24,306
I would think so.

222
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:26,906
I mean, it's not one of the mystery stories I wrote, you know.

223
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:32,706
In fact, I thought of writing a story based on his death,

224
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,606
but Ms. Anabuki stopped me.

225
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:37,206
Most naturally!

226
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:38,706
The fact that he died suddenly

227
00:14:38,706 --> 00:14:41,706
is quite widespread, in the publishing business.

228
00:14:41,706 --> 00:14:44,406
Therefore, writing a novel about it

229
00:14:44,406 --> 00:14:48,906
would just make way for gossip articles.

230
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:50,406
That's why I asked him not to.

231
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,406
Gossip is gossip

232
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:54,006
and not the truth.

233
00:14:54,006 --> 00:14:55,006
Besides,

234
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:58,206
if it's entitled something like "A Tribute to Editor Akiba",

235
00:14:58,206 --> 00:15:01,306
maybe it would've sold, don't you think?

236
00:15:01,306 --> 00:15:03,306
Well...

237
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,006
What...

238
00:15:09,406 --> 00:15:10,606
Oh, no.

239
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:13,106
I'm out of lead.

240
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:15,806
Would you like to use mine?

241
00:15:28,206 --> 00:15:32,406
But I use regular pencils.

242
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:34,106
Even though it's analogue.

243
00:15:35,506 --> 00:15:38,006
Well, then. Thank you.

244
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,406
Okay, let's just decide

245
00:15:41,406 --> 00:15:44,406
on the course of action for tomorrow for now.

246
00:15:46,506 --> 00:15:49,506
After all, we're be filming tomorrow morning.

247
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:52,106
Taking up time eating like this is doing us no good.

248
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:00,806
Besides, I don't want to waste film.

249
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:09,806
After that,

250
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:13,806
talking over arrangements continued over dinner

251
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,106
for two hours.

252
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:19,506
We had no idea that all this work would amount to nothing.

253
00:16:19,506 --> 00:16:20,806
Right.

254
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:24,806
Because the main character of the interview...

255
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:28,706
Mr. Moroguchi?

256
00:16:28,706 --> 00:16:30,806
It's already 5:00 a.m!

257
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:35,006
Mr. Moroguchi? Moroguchi!

258
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:38,206
What's the matter?

259
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,606
Mr. Mouri!

260
00:16:39,606 --> 00:16:41,806
Is he still asleep?

261
00:16:41,806 --> 00:16:42,806
Yes.

262
00:16:42,806 --> 00:16:46,806
Maybe he was working till late last night.

263
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,406
Let's use a spare key to open the door

264
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:49,606
and wake him up then!

265
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:50,706
The thing is,

266
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:55,506
Mr. Moroguchi hated for others to go into this room

267
00:16:55,506 --> 00:16:57,406
so there is no spare key.

268
00:16:57,406 --> 00:16:59,306
He said that he didn't want his works to be stolen.

269
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:00,606
Hey, Conan.

270
00:17:00,606 --> 00:17:02,506
What're you doing?

271
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:08,406
I have this bad premonition.

272
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:09,706
Like something is pushing down on my chest.

273
00:17:09,706 --> 00:17:11,706
I feel like I'm having difficulty breathing.

274
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:14,006
At times like this,

275
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:15,906
almost without fail...

276
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,906
It's been about an hour since he passed on.

277
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:26,506
The odor of almond.

278
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:28,606
Cyanide type poison.

279
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:31,506
The stuff around his mouth is coffee.

280
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:33,906
Was the poison mixed in his drink?

281
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:40,406
The room was locked completely.

282
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:42,006
The only place that was open

283
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:44,806
was the place I used to come in here.

284
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:46,306
Just that ventilation window,

285
00:17:46,306 --> 00:17:49,006
only big enough for a child to barely make it through.

286
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:53,406
The thing that he is holding in his hand

287
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,906
is probably the key to this room.

288
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:57,006
Is it suicide?

289
00:17:57,006 --> 00:18:00,506
No. This is...

290
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:02,306
murder?

291
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:33,413
The victim is a mystery novelist,

292
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:36,113
Mr. Masutaka Moroguchi, age 52.

293
00:18:36,113 --> 00:18:38,613
The cause of death is suffocation

294
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:40,113
due to cyanide poisoning.

295
00:18:40,113 --> 00:18:43,113
From the coffee that is left around his mouth,

296
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:44,213
he most likely...

297
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:48,013
Mixed cyanide into his drink and drank it

298
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:51,113
or, somebody made him drink it.

299
00:18:52,513 --> 00:18:53,613
What is it?

300
00:18:53,613 --> 00:18:56,713
I don't think anyone made him drink it.

301
00:18:56,713 --> 00:18:58,413
Because the door and windows of this room

302
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:00,513
were completely locked.

303
00:19:00,513 --> 00:19:02,613
It was indeed a locked room.

304
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:05,313
Moreover, Mr. Moroguchi is holding

305
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:06,713
the key to this room in his hand,

306
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,213
and neither is there a spare key.

307
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,613
Taking all these things into consideration,

308
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:12,013
suicide is the only thinkable conclusion, isn't it?

309
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:13,713
Why would it be so?

310
00:19:13,713 --> 00:19:15,913
If someone put cyanide

311
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:18,913
into his coffee cup beforehand,

312
00:19:18,913 --> 00:19:21,313
wouldn't a locked room murder be possible?

313
00:19:21,313 --> 00:19:23,313
Of course, that's if someone knew

314
00:19:23,313 --> 00:19:28,113
that Mr. Moroguchi drinks coffee after getting up in the morning.

315
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:29,813
Idiot!

316
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:31,413
A person normally doesn't drink coffee

317
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:33,413
holding a key in his hand, does he?

318
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:35,813
Of course, it would be impossible to grab the key

319
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:37,113
even if he were to have realized

320
00:19:37,113 --> 00:19:39,913
that he had drunk poisoned coffee.

321
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:41,113
So, it's most probable

322
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:45,413
that he held the key before drinking the poisoned coffee.

323
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:48,013
So, it must be some kind of message from him.

324
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:50,813
But wasn't Mr. Moroguchi scheduled to have

325
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:54,013
a talk show with you this morning, Mr. Mouri?

326
00:19:55,813 --> 00:19:56,813
If so,

327
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:59,213
maybe he overslept, and in his haste, picked up the key

328
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:00,613
before leaving the room then,

329
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:04,913
sipped a cup of coffee to wake himself up, right?

330
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,713
For God's sake, take a good look!

331
00:20:08,713 --> 00:20:11,813
The coffee cup was on the floor beside the bed.

332
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:13,713
Yes, that's true.

333
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:18,813
The coffee maker's in the kitchen over that side.

334
00:20:18,813 --> 00:20:20,013
If he were in a rush,

335
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:22,213
wouldn't he have made the coffee in the kitchen

336
00:20:22,213 --> 00:20:24,213
and drunk it then and there?

337
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:25,813
He would never put the cup on a saucer,

338
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:29,113
take it his bed and drink it!

339
00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:32,013
But what if it were this way?

340
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:34,713
Somebody who came to wake Mr. Moroguchi up,

341
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:37,713
made coffee mixed with cyanide

342
00:20:37,713 --> 00:20:39,813
and put it beside his bed.

343
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:43,113
Then told him to hurry, made him hold the key

344
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:44,813
and left the room?

345
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:46,613
Not possible.

346
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:49,613
If so, that someone

347
00:20:49,613 --> 00:20:51,513
would've had to leave the room

348
00:20:51,513 --> 00:20:53,813
before Mr. Moroguchi drank the coffee,

349
00:20:53,813 --> 00:20:56,813
and make him lock the door.

350
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:58,613
This sounds pretty impossible.

351
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:00,313
Whether or not a person drinks the coffee

352
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:02,513
that is served right away, depends on the person.

353
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,413
But if he were rushed,

354
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:06,813
he probably would've drunk it.

355
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:09,913
It could be that Mr. Moroguchi didn't like hot stuff

356
00:21:09,913 --> 00:21:12,813
and didn't drink his coffee right away.

357
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,213
No way!

358
00:21:15,713 --> 00:21:18,713
Mr. Moroguchi liked coffee very much

359
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:20,413
so whether it was hot or warm,

360
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:24,313
he would drink it saying it was delicious.

361
00:21:24,313 --> 00:21:26,313
Isn't that right?

362
00:21:26,313 --> 00:21:27,313
Yes.

363
00:21:27,313 --> 00:21:29,213
Everybody knew about it in the editing room.

364
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:33,513
And who are you?

365
00:21:33,513 --> 00:21:34,513
Yes.

366
00:21:34,513 --> 00:21:39,013
I'm Anabuki in charge of editing for Mr. Moroguchi.

367
00:21:39,013 --> 00:21:40,313
The two behind me,

368
00:21:40,313 --> 00:21:42,713
are to the right, cameraman, Mr. Tarumi,

369
00:21:42,713 --> 00:21:45,613
and to the left, Mr. Dejima, a writer.

370
00:21:45,613 --> 00:21:49,213
Did you three come here to make plans

371
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:52,813
on the talk show this morning?

372
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:55,113
No, all three of us

373
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,813
spent the night here from last night.

374
00:21:56,813 --> 00:21:59,613
I mean, it's kind of tough trying to get here

375
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:02,113
before 5:00 in the morning, so...

376
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,813
But, how strange.

377
00:22:05,113 --> 00:22:06,613
If the room were locked,

378
00:22:06,613 --> 00:22:07,913
you'd most likely break the door down

379
00:22:07,913 --> 00:22:10,313
or crack the window,

380
00:22:10,313 --> 00:22:13,013
but there are no such traces.

381
00:22:13,013 --> 00:22:15,413
How did you make it into the room?

382
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:19,413
This brat did it! Phooey!

383
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:24,813
Conan went in through that ventilation window over there,

384
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:28,013
and opened the door from the inside for us,

385
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,913
and we got in.

386
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:34,013
That's when we found Mr. Moroguchi dead.

387
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:36,513
Which means that the window was open?

388
00:22:36,513 --> 00:22:38,613
Yes, that's right.

389
00:22:38,613 --> 00:22:40,813
But it's only wide enough

390
00:22:40,813 --> 00:22:42,513
for a child to get through, isn't it?

391
00:22:42,513 --> 00:22:45,313
Let's assume that it was suicide.

392
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:46,713
Yet, why would Mr. Moroguchi die

393
00:22:46,713 --> 00:22:49,713
holding the key in his hand?

394
00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:53,013
Maybe the culprit didn't want all of us here at the villa

395
00:22:53,013 --> 00:22:57,513
to be suspected of murder.

396
00:22:57,513 --> 00:22:58,813
Like I just said,

397
00:22:58,813 --> 00:23:01,313
if this were murder,

398
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,113
unless the culprit said something like,

399
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:06,013
"Drink your coffee while holding your key and lock the door..."

400
00:23:06,013 --> 00:23:08,813
This situation would be hard to create.

401
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:10,213
And?

402
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:11,413
Would you have any idea as to why Mr. Moroguchi

403
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:12,613
would want to commit suicide?

404
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:15,113
No. Not that I know of.

405
00:23:15,113 --> 00:23:18,213
He didn't show any such signs, did he?

406
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:21,413
No, not at all.

407
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:23,913
Well, maybe he had a lot of things on his mind

408
00:23:23,913 --> 00:23:26,013
that he couldn't tell others.

409
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:27,513
It seems that the previous editor,

410
00:23:27,513 --> 00:23:29,613
Mr. Akiba, who was in charge of him

411
00:23:29,613 --> 00:23:32,113
committed suicide this spring too.

412
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:36,413
It could be that he felt seriously responsible for what happened.

413
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:41,113
At any rate,

414
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:44,213
let's wait for the forensic officer to arrive.

415
00:23:44,213 --> 00:23:46,013
If this is homicide,

416
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:47,713
the fingerprints of the culprit

417
00:23:47,713 --> 00:23:49,413
has to be somewhere here.

418
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:52,613
If the culprit wore gloves when serving coffee

419
00:23:52,613 --> 00:23:54,413
or when opening and closing the door,

420
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:56,913
I'm sure it would breed suspicion in Mr. Moroguchi too.

421
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:58,513
Besides, if the door was locked,

422
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:00,713
the culprit wouldn't have had time to wipe anything off.

423
00:24:00,713 --> 00:24:03,613
That is, if none of you touched anything

424
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:06,013
before I got here.

425
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:09,313
No, because Detective Mouri warned us not to touch anything

426
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:12,213
until the police got here.

427
00:24:12,213 --> 00:24:14,213
I'm sure this is a suicide case,

428
00:24:14,213 --> 00:24:16,513
no need to call the forensic officers.

429
00:24:16,513 --> 00:24:18,513
Officer Takagi.

430
00:24:20,313 --> 00:24:22,413
Doesn't it bother you?

431
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:24,013
What do you mean?

432
00:24:24,013 --> 00:24:25,813
The ring!

433
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:29,513
What? What're you talking about? Conan!

434
00:24:29,513 --> 00:24:31,913
Well, of course it'd be a lie

435
00:24:31,913 --> 00:24:33,213
if I said it didn't bother me,

436
00:24:33,213 --> 00:24:36,213
but now we're in the middle of an investigation.

437
00:24:38,213 --> 00:24:39,513
No!

438
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,413
Where are you looking? Over here!

439
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:46,613
This man's ring.

440
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:50,213
The number 100 that's carved is upside down.

441
00:24:52,513 --> 00:24:53,713
Right,

442
00:24:53,713 --> 00:24:56,713
but he could've just put it on upside down by mistake.

443
00:24:56,713 --> 00:25:00,313
But this man was a very nervous person,

444
00:25:00,313 --> 00:25:03,313
so I don't think he'd make such a mistake.

445
00:25:03,313 --> 00:25:05,113
Besides, this ring...

446
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:11,413
See! There're so many diamonds on it.

447
00:25:12,913 --> 00:25:15,113
Oh, I see!

448
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,013
So this is a homicide case after all!

449
00:25:17,013 --> 00:25:18,513
What?

450
00:25:18,513 --> 00:25:22,113
The reason he was killed was because of this ring!

451
00:25:22,113 --> 00:25:24,813
The culprit switched the ring with the genuine stones on it

452
00:25:24,813 --> 00:25:26,413
with a fake one

453
00:25:26,413 --> 00:25:29,013
and when the culprit put the fake back on Mr. Moroguchi's finger,

454
00:25:29,013 --> 00:25:32,213
he put it on upside down in his haste!

455
00:25:32,213 --> 00:25:36,113
Did Mr. Moroguchi ever take this ring off?

456
00:25:36,113 --> 00:25:39,213
No. He liked it very much,

457
00:25:39,213 --> 00:25:42,513
so much so that he used to wear it

458
00:25:42,513 --> 00:25:46,213
even when taking a bath and going to bed.

459
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:49,413
Then, just as Officer Takagi says,

460
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:52,113
there is a high probability that this is a case of homicide.

461
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:55,513
So, another mystery has emerged.

462
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:56,713
I see.

463
00:25:56,713 --> 00:25:59,413
The only time the culprit could've switched the ring

464
00:25:59,413 --> 00:26:02,013
is after Mr. Moroguchi died.

465
00:26:02,013 --> 00:26:06,213
And most naturally, the culprit was in this room at that time.

466
00:26:06,213 --> 00:26:07,713
If so,

467
00:26:07,713 --> 00:26:12,313
how did the culprit escape from this locked room?

468
00:26:12,313 --> 00:26:16,613
How on earth, after leaving the key in Mr. Moroguchi's hand?

469
00:26:16,613 --> 00:26:19,913
Or is it that after poisoning Mr. Moroguchi,

470
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:23,313
the culprit left this room and locked the door,

471
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:26,113
and in some way returned the key

472
00:26:26,113 --> 00:26:29,013
into Mr. Moroguchi's hand from outside?

473
00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:33,413
Only that ventilation window was open.

474
00:26:33,413 --> 00:26:34,813
There's nearly 4 meters from over there

475
00:26:34,813 --> 00:26:36,913
to the hand of the corpse.

476
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:44,413
It's too far to do something like that.
