1
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:22,021
Today, an out of the ordinary talk show

2
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,421
between a baseball player and Pops in Okinawa

3
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:25,621
turns into a murder case.

4
00:00:25,622 --> 00:00:27,021
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:29,021
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,022 --> 00:00:31,022
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:56,426 --> 00:02:01,426
"9:33 am, Okinawa (Naha)"

8
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:09,878
You haven't changed, have you, Nose?

9
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:14,377
The way you tilt your neck to the right when you run.

10
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:16,377
That habit of yours.

11
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:17,677
Motoyama.

12
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:19,877
What brings you here?

13
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:21,977
It's only just past 9:30 am?

14
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:23,977
I told you over the phone last night, didn't I?

15
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:26,578
That I'd fly over if for you.

16
00:02:28,278 --> 00:02:31,478
Like Hideyoshi would.

17
00:02:36,078 --> 00:02:41,477
"The Silent Route (Part 1)"

18
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:44,477
"Half day ago, 6:29 pm, Tokyo" -What? We're going to Okinawa tomorrow?

19
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:46,577
You didn't tell me about it at all!

20
00:02:46,578 --> 00:02:48,777
Didn't I tell you about it?

21
00:02:48,778 --> 00:02:49,977
You know him, don't you?

22
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:50,978
The King of Save,

23
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:53,977
Toshizou Nose of the professional baseball team, Jaguars!

24
00:02:53,978 --> 00:02:58,977
Nichiuri TV has asked me to have a chat session with him!

25
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:01,177
But I wonder why they chose you, Pops?

26
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:02,877
A professional baseball player and detective

27
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:05,378
don't seem to have much in common.

28
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:08,377
Are you dumb or what?

29
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:12,177
Nose is known as the brain pitcher player of the baseball world!

30
00:03:12,178 --> 00:03:15,777
It's his sharp-eye of discerning the habits

31
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:19,778
and type of ball the batter will hit against my power of deduction!

32
00:03:21,478 --> 00:03:23,877
Are you sure you can handle it?

33
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:26,977
I hear that Mr. Nose is a very difficult person to deal with.

34
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:28,377
Don't worry!

35
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:30,777
I hear that this sport reporter who is on good terms with Nose

36
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:33,977
-will join in on our conversation too. -Thank you very much.

37
00:03:33,978 --> 00:03:37,777
So, that was Mr. Kigure training here in Miyazaki!

38
00:03:37,778 --> 00:03:41,677
He seems to be all out to get a straight victory for the Falcons!

39
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:42,877
Thank you very much.

40
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:43,878
Then, Mr. Motoyama,

41
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,577
you're scheduled for a talk show with Mr. Nose tomorrow in Okinawa,

42
00:03:46,578 --> 00:03:48,877
I hope that it'll be as interesting as today.

43
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,077
I'll be fine! Nose is my best friend

44
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:54,477
and besides, a famous detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri,

45
00:03:54,478 --> 00:03:56,477
will pitch in to help me tomorrow too!

46
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:57,478
See!

47
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,777
What time is your flight tomorrow?

48
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:04,777
I think it's departing at 6:35 am from Haneda Airport tomorrow

49
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:08,177
because Nose's seems to only be free in the morning.

50
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:13,177
What? Which means we have to get up before 5 am?

51
00:04:13,178 --> 00:04:17,477
Then, we'll have to get ready and hit the sack early today too, Conan!

52
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:18,877
Okay!

53
00:04:18,878 --> 00:04:20,977
Hey... I'm going alone.

54
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:23,877
Right, let's run over to the convenience store now

55
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:26,077
and pick up stuff that we need!

56
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:27,977
Okay! Let's go!

57
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:30,477
We've to hurry because we don't have time!

58
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,777
I tell you, Dad, you should've told us earlier.

59
00:04:32,778 --> 00:04:35,078
He's being mean, isn't he?

60
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:40,177
"Same day, 7:20 pm, Miyazaki."

61
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:42,977
Hi, Nose! Did you watch the program?

62
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:45,677
My corner that was aired a while ago.

63
00:04:45,678 --> 00:04:49,277
"Masaharu Motoyama" -Yeah. You mean the sports program on Nichiuri TV

64
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:52,177
that's aired at around 6:30 pm?

65
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:53,377
Right.

66
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:57,677
"At the same time, Okinawa" -Sorry. I was out eating and missed it.

67
00:04:57,678 --> 00:04:59,877
"Toshizou Nose" -I'm going out drinking with some young players

68
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:01,877
who are training here with me now.

69
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:03,277
Did you want anything?

70
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:07,477
No. All I wanted to say was see you at the talk show tomorrow.

71
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:09,777
Same here and help me out

72
00:05:09,778 --> 00:05:13,577
if the Detective Kogoro Mouri digs in too deep, will you?

73
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,177
By the way, Motoyama.

74
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:17,577
Don't miss your flight tomorrow!

75
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:19,877
You're not that great getting up in the morning.

76
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:23,877
I'll be fine, since my flight leaves at 8:15 am.

77
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:26,678
You know I'll fly over if for you, right?

78
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:30,477
Just like Hideyoshi would.

79
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,077
Hideyoshi?

80
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:34,777
Then am I supposed to be Nobunaga or something?

81
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:39,577
It's true that I'm the one who got you that TV job after you retired

82
00:05:39,578 --> 00:05:41,977
but I only did it because we entered the team at that same time!

83
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:44,278
No need to feel obligated or anything!

84
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,977
The young ones are here, I got to go.

85
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:49,477
See you tomorrow!

86
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:52,377
Yeah. Don't drink too much!

87
00:05:52,378 --> 00:05:56,977
You've got the Japan record career save on your shoulder.

88
00:05:56,978 --> 00:05:58,078
Yeah!

89
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:04,278
You, Nobunaga?

90
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:08,877
You're Mitsuhide.

91
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:10,677
"8:09 am, Flight SKJ931 (Tokyo to Okinawa)"

92
00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:12,877
Of all things,

93
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:15,678
they've come along with me.

94
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:20,477
What's wrong? When you called the TV station last night,

95
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,577
they said they'd pay for Conan and I too, didn't they?

96
00:06:24,578 --> 00:06:27,977
Thanks to you guys, my seat was ranked down to a regular seat, though.

97
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:32,977
The Okinawa food that I ate last time I went was really delicious!

98
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:37,877
My plans of having a ball over food a drinks with an Okinawan beauty.

99
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:39,377
Darn it!

100
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:40,477
Don't worry!

101
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,277
I'll just take pictures with my digital camera and won't get in your way.

102
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,877
Did you have a digital camera?

103
00:06:45,878 --> 00:06:46,978
Yep.

104
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:54,178
Remember? The one that you won at the year-end party?

105
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:03,477
I'm so sorry!

106
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:05,077
I'm sorry!

107
00:07:05,078 --> 00:07:06,777
Thank you very much.

108
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:10,277
Why did you bring tennis balls with you?

109
00:07:10,278 --> 00:07:11,377
Well, a boy in my class that's in the baseball club,

110
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:14,177
who was watching the program last night,

111
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:16,877
asked me to get him Mr. Nose's autograph.

112
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:18,977
I told them that I didn't have the card to write autographs on,

113
00:07:18,978 --> 00:07:21,777
then they said anything is okay.

114
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:26,177
So I brought the tennis balls that Sonoko gave me.

115
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:29,077
The ball that dad used for the community baseball game

116
00:07:29,078 --> 00:07:30,677
was all soiled and dirty besides.

117
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:34,077
Does four balls mean there are four members in your class

118
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,177
that are in the baseball club?

119
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:37,477
There are three boys in the baseball club

120
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:41,077
and the other one is for me.

121
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:42,477
It's Eri, isn't it?

122
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:44,877
She used to be a Jaguar fan.

123
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:48,477
Right! So please, will you get his autograph for mother?

124
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:49,777
No way!

125
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:51,877
I don't want to stick a tennis ball out at a baseball player

126
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:54,578
and ask for his autograph.

127
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:56,977
True.

128
00:07:56,978 --> 00:08:01,478
"9:23 am, Okinawa (Naha Airport)"

129
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:03,377
Thank you for waiting, Mr. Mouri.

130
00:08:03,378 --> 00:08:06,477
I'm Teranishi of Nichiuri TV Okinawa!

131
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,777
Hello, I'm here with my daughter!

132
00:08:09,778 --> 00:08:12,377
Daughter? Where is she?

133
00:08:12,378 --> 00:08:13,378
What?

134
00:08:14,778 --> 00:08:16,677
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

135
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:19,177
I'm going to go see if they sell autograph cards!

136
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:20,577
I tell you.

137
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:23,077
By the way, how's the you know what?

138
00:08:23,078 --> 00:08:25,677
Oh, you mean at night, right?

139
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:27,777
Yes, I've reserved a great place!

140
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:29,177
Oh! No.

141
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:30,677
We're canceling that!

142
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,777
I'm talking about the other stuff.

143
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,677
Oh. That.

144
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:39,777
I asked Mr. Motoyama who will join in on the talk show today

145
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:40,877
and he agreed just like that.

146
00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:42,277
That's good to know!

147
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:46,077
And, Mr. Motoyama has already arrived here from Miyazaki?

148
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:49,377
No. He'll be on the flight arriving at 9:50 am

149
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:51,877
so we'll have to wait another 30 minutes.

150
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:55,577
That's the only flight there is from Miyazaki to Okinawa.

151
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:58,377
Then, shall I take my daughter and the boy

152
00:08:58,378 --> 00:09:00,977
to the hotel that Mr. Nose will be staying at?

153
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:04,777
I guess so but I don't think Mr. Nose is there.

154
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,877
Why not?

155
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:11,977
He seems to routinely jogs from 9 am to 10 am in the morning.

156
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:14,577
So, I'm sure that he in the midst of...

157
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:17,778
running along a road somewhere near the hotel.

158
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:23,278
"9:34 am, Okinawa (Naha)"

159
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:28,677
You know about it, don't you?

160
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:30,677
The "great revenge" of Hideyoshi.

161
00:09:30,678 --> 00:09:33,677
That is Mitsuhide who wanted to kill Nobunaga

162
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:36,677
and rule over the world.

163
00:09:36,678 --> 00:09:39,477
The superhuman act of Hideyoshi, going from Okayama to Kyoto

164
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,877
in as little as three days to take revenge.

165
00:09:42,878 --> 00:09:46,377
Nose, I hate to say this

166
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,878
but I'm not letting you get to the top.

167
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:57,678
"9:52 am, Okinawa (Naha Airport)"

168
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:00,677
Hey, how long are you going to keep searching?

169
00:10:00,678 --> 00:10:03,377
Mr. Motoyama's flight should be arriving soon!

170
00:10:03,378 --> 00:10:06,777
Well, I can't find autograph cards anywhere!

171
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:10,577
Okay! I'll get autographs for your friends for you, then.

172
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:13,177
Really! You'll get mother's too then, right?

173
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:14,178
No way.

174
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,677
What's with you!

175
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:19,377
Do you know where they sell autograph cards near here?

176
00:10:19,378 --> 00:10:20,577
Autograph card?

177
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,977
Let's see. The nearest place is...

178
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:25,177
-Dad! -There he is!

179
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:27,677
Mr. Motoyama, over here!

180
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:30,177
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

181
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:32,977
How do you do? I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri!

182
00:10:32,978 --> 00:10:34,777
I'm Masaharu Motoyama!

183
00:10:34,778 --> 00:10:36,377
I've heard a lot about you.

184
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:39,377
-I'm his daughter. -I'm sorry!

185
00:10:39,378 --> 00:10:40,777
We don't have much time,

186
00:10:40,778 --> 00:10:42,877
so let's continue the introductions in the car.

187
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:45,577
-All right! -Shall we get going then?

188
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,077
Okinawa sure is a nice place.

189
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:50,377
Too bad it's raining, though.

190
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:52,277
Hey! Let's go sonny!

191
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:55,477
Oh, okay.

192
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:57,777
Mr. Motoyama seems to be a kind person

193
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:00,677
so maybe I'll be able to ask him for Mr. Nose's autograph.

194
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:03,078
I guess so.

195
00:11:13,778 --> 00:11:17,877
It seems that Nose hasn't returned to the hotel yet.

196
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:21,277
Maybe he got tired on the way back and is resting somewhere?

197
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,278
After all, he's not all that young. I mean you know...

198
00:11:25,378 --> 00:11:26,578
That's...

199
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:32,778
Hey, you'll catch cold sleeping in a place like that!

200
00:11:36,878 --> 00:11:38,177
That is...

201
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:39,878
The uniform of the Jaguars.

202
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:49,178
Hey, Conan!

203
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,677
Hey! Isn't he Mr. Nose?

204
00:11:54,678 --> 00:11:57,277
-No way. -Mr. Nose?

205
00:11:57,278 --> 00:11:59,377
This is bad!

206
00:11:59,378 --> 00:12:02,777
Hurry and contact the police and get an ambulance!

207
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:04,378
The police?

208
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,464
Hey! Isn't he Mr. Nose?

209
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:17,164
-No way. -Mr. Nose?

210
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:19,064
This is bad!

211
00:12:19,065 --> 00:12:22,465
Hurry and contact the police and get an ambulance!

212
00:12:23,565 --> 00:12:25,764
The police?

213
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:28,465
No. There's no need to call an ambulance.

214
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:32,264
Mr. Nose has been stabbed in the stomach with something

215
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:33,864
and is already dead.

216
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:34,865
No way.

217
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:37,864
Ran! You brought a digital camera along, didn't you?

218
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:39,564
Yes.

219
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:43,665
Let's take a picture of the scene before the police get here.

220
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:51,865
The digital camera...

221
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:06,964
Here it is!

222
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:08,564
Hey, Ran! You haven't found it yet?

223
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:10,164
Hurry it up, will you?

224
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,265
Okay!

225
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:16,964
First from right above,

226
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:18,464
take two or three pictures.

227
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,065
Be careful not go inside the grassy area.

228
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:32,764
What's wrong, Ran?

229
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:34,464
Well...

230
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:36,264
I was thinking of getting mom

231
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:40,864
a picture of Mr. Nose posing his signature pose.

232
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:43,265
And yet I end up taking this kind of picture.

233
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:49,964
Sorry, never mind already.

234
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:52,965
I'll take the pictures so you go back inside the car.

235
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:39,764
This guy's Nose of the Jaguars!

236
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:43,364
I saw on TV that he was training over here.

237
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:47,564
The estimated time of death is around 9:30 am.

238
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:48,764
The cause of death is loss of blood

239
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:51,664
from being stabbed in the stomach with a knife.

240
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:54,364
The weapon hasn't been found yet though.

241
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:56,264
And where is the person who found him?

242
00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:58,865
I think it was...

243
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:04,764
Who is the one that found the body?

244
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:06,164
It would be us.

245
00:15:06,165 --> 00:15:08,164
We coincidentally happened to drive by

246
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:11,964
and found Mr. Nose lying on the ground!

247
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:16,264
He was probably stabbed by someone while jogging.

248
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:18,264
If I remember correctly, you're...

249
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:20,064
Yeah. That famous detective.

250
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:21,664
Do you know me?

251
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:24,064
Mr. Kogoro Mouri, right?

252
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:26,264
You're the talk of the town in Okinawa!

253
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:29,264
Yes...

254
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:31,564
You're highly valued for your tremendous appetite, right?

255
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:32,665
Yeah.

256
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:36,464
Come to think of it, when we were here before this,

257
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:39,165
Pops entered a big-eater's contest with Hattori.

258
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,164
So, it's almost as if the case has been solved then!

259
00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:45,964
We're counting on you!

260
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:48,664
I wonder if they really believe so.

261
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:53,665
I know somebody you can count on more than Mr. Mouri, though!

262
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:57,764
Sports reporter, Mr. Motoyama!

263
00:15:57,765 --> 00:16:00,464
Just what are you talking about, sonny?

264
00:16:00,465 --> 00:16:03,764
Because when we found Mr. Nose,

265
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:06,264
his blood was drained in the rain

266
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,364
and unless we went up close to take a look

267
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:11,465
we couldn't tell that he was stabbed in the stomach!

268
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:18,064
Besides, if one knew that Mr. Nose was jogging,

269
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:20,564
wouldn't it be most natural to think that Mr. Nose fell ill

270
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:22,164
and was lying on the ground?

271
00:16:22,165 --> 00:16:26,164
But you said to call the police without even getting off the car.

272
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:30,064
Hurry and contact the police and get an ambulance!

273
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:32,965
Even Holmes can't beat you as a detective!

274
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:37,464
How did you know?

275
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:39,465
That it was murder?

276
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:46,964
Come to think of it, before I checked Mr. Nose's stomach

277
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,864
and mentioned him being stabbed you.

278
00:16:49,865 --> 00:16:52,364
-Through a phone call! -A phone call?

279
00:16:52,365 --> 00:16:54,264
After the TV appearance last night,

280
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:57,064
I called Nose from the hotel in Miyazaki,

281
00:16:57,065 --> 00:16:58,964
he mentioned that.

282
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:01,564
A strange man claiming to be a Jaguars anti-fans

283
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:03,865
was troubling him with crank calls.

284
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:07,464
Well, when I saw Nose lying on the ground,

285
00:17:07,465 --> 00:17:09,564
I just felt that something was wrong.

286
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:11,364
Is that true?

287
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:15,064
Well, I guess it'll do you no good to suspect me anyway,

288
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:18,164
because I couldn't have committed the crime.

289
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:19,364
Just what do you mean?

290
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:22,264
Because Mr. Nose's estimated time of death

291
00:17:22,265 --> 00:17:24,664
is about 9:30 am this morning, right?

292
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:26,064
Just around that time,

293
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:28,664
I was on the flight that left Miyazaki at 8:15 am

294
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:33,464
and scheduled to arrive in Okinawa at 9:50 am.

295
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:34,864
Check the passenger's list!

296
00:17:34,865 --> 00:17:35,865
Yes, sir!

297
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,564
My name is not on the list.

298
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:41,864
Why not?

299
00:17:41,865 --> 00:17:43,464
I'm pretty well known.

300
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:44,864
I don't like people making a fuss

301
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:48,564
that I've always bought my tickets under an alias.

302
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:51,564
Besides, I was slightly disguised wearing a hat and all that,

303
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:54,764
I don't think anyone saw me.

304
00:17:54,765 --> 00:17:57,465
So, what was the alias that you used?

305
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:00,264
Yamada.

306
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:02,665
No, maybe it was Tanaka?

307
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:08,464
Well, if Mr. Motoyama was in Miyazaki last night,

308
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:10,064
he has an alibi.

309
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:14,164
Because that's the only fight that flies from Miyazaki to Okinawa.

310
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:19,864
Please go ahead and ask the hotel in Miyazaki that I spent the night at.

311
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,065
Here you go.

312
00:18:22,465 --> 00:18:26,664
The Miyazaki Princess Hotel, room number...

313
00:18:26,665 --> 00:18:28,264
Is it this one?

314
00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:32,764
I called Mr. Nose on my cell phone last night

315
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:35,965
so please check the outgoing calls record of that room.

316
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:38,264
Okay, hurry and check it out!

317
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:39,265
Yes, sir!

318
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:40,564
Okay, then everyone...

319
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:43,464
May I ask all of you to come with me to the station?

320
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:44,465
Darn it.

321
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:46,964
It was supposed to be the great chat show of all three of us.

322
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:48,464
Great chat show?

323
00:18:48,465 --> 00:18:52,264
He's from Nichiuri TV of Okinawa,

324
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:56,464
and was scheduled to have a chat with Mr. Nose today.

325
00:18:56,465 --> 00:18:59,864
That includes Mr. Motoyama and I.

326
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:01,164
Who would've even imagined that

327
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:05,064
we'd run into Nose's corpse while heading over to his hotel.

328
00:19:05,065 --> 00:19:08,065
Well, we'll get to the details back at the station then.

329
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,264
Inspector!

330
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:13,564
We found this near the corpse.

331
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:15,764
A timetable and can of tennis balls?

332
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:17,864
They're mine!

333
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,264
I'm sorry!

334
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:22,065
I seem to have dropped them when I got off the car.

335
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:35,565
"Okinawa Prefecture Police, Naha Headquarters."

336
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:37,964
Inspector! It's been confirmed!

337
00:19:37,965 --> 00:19:39,665
What?

338
00:19:40,965 --> 00:19:43,164
About the phone call.

339
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:47,464
It's true that Mr. Motoyama called Mr. Nose

340
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:51,464
from his hotel in Miyazaki at 7:20 pm to 7:23 pm yesterday.

341
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:52,465
See?

342
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:58,364
Even without it, I appeared live on TV from Miyazaki last night.

343
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:03,264
Viewers all over the nation will prove my alibi for me.

344
00:20:03,265 --> 00:20:05,464
Come to think of it, that's true.

345
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:08,364
And? Have you heard of any characteristics of the man

346
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:11,564
who was making crank calls to Mr. Nose?

347
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:14,364
No. All he said was an odd man.

348
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:16,564
An odd man.

349
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:19,464
It sure is strange, though.

350
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:22,364
I confirmed with his other teammates,

351
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:25,964
but none of them seems to have heard of any crank calls.

352
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:28,864
Of course not.

353
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:32,064
Nose was the much feared guardian of the Jaguars,

354
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,464
so I'm sure he couldn't mention anything

355
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:36,264
about being frightened over a crank call.

356
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:38,364
I, however, have been best friends with him for a long time

357
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:40,764
and there was nothing we didn't talk about with each other.

358
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:41,864
Now that you mentioned it,

359
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:45,464
you entered the team at the same time as Mr. Nose, didn't you?

360
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:47,164
Yes.

361
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:50,564
You were awarded King of Save and Best Rookie the first year.

362
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:53,064
But I damaged my shoulder the second year and underwent an operation.

363
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:55,264
However, I never regained my pitching velocity

364
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:57,164
and resigned in my fifth year.

365
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:59,764
I gave in to the second year jinx

366
00:20:59,765 --> 00:21:02,964
and was no more than a one-time clutch player.

367
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:04,864
I was planning to tell the young players

368
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:09,664
who are training here with Nose here tomorrow, but...

369
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:12,064
Under the circumstances, I guess it'll be better to cancel

370
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:14,164
the interview of the young players

371
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:16,465
that we were planning to hold tomorrow.

372
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:29,964
At any rate, please arrest the murderer as soon as possible.

373
00:21:29,965 --> 00:21:33,064
The devil who got in the way of my best friend

374
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:35,864
making his Japan record of saves.

375
00:21:35,865 --> 00:21:37,465
No, not right.

376
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,465
He's the killer.

377
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:44,364
Can I make a phone call?

378
00:21:44,365 --> 00:21:45,764
I'll be done in a minute.

379
00:21:45,765 --> 00:21:47,165
Sure, go ahead.

380
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:51,865
But he has an alibi.

381
00:21:54,765 --> 00:21:56,465
Why on earth...

382
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:11,565
What the...

383
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:22,164
What is this?

384
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:23,565
What's this thing that I feel?

385
00:23:57,565 --> 00:23:58,964
"Next Episode."

386
00:23:58,965 --> 00:24:02,364
Conan...

387
00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:03,664
What's the matter?

388
00:24:03,665 --> 00:24:04,764
Are you all right?

389
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:06,164
What a frightening look you have on your face.

390
00:24:06,165 --> 00:24:09,264
What was that?

391
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:12,764
I found the seat but you can't go straight.

392
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:15,164
Okay, then...

393
00:24:15,165 --> 00:24:17,664
Well, that's natural too.

394
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,165
Because you killed him.

395
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:27,565
Next Conan, "The Silent Route (Part 2)"

396
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,264
Next Conan's Hint:

397
00:24:45,265 --> 00:24:47,064
"Timetable."

398
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:49,364
Summer vacation's almost over. Conan, how's your homework coming along?

399
00:24:49,365 --> 00:24:50,365
What about you, Ran?

400
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:52,265
I wonder if Shinichi's doing okay?
