1
00:00:07,477 --> 00:00:09,726
Ah, a loaf of bread.

2
00:00:09,727 --> 00:00:11,857
Wait, we don't have a toaster.

3
00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:13,857
I'll get these instead.

4
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:15,277
Curry Roll

5
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:22,366
He's buying a lot of stuff.

6
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:24,846
Yeah. Is he going to eat all that himself?

7
00:00:24,847 --> 00:00:29,086
Unlikely. There must be some reason for this.

8
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:29,947
Yeah.

9
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:49,396
Looks like we were mistaken.

10
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:52,526
It looks like he came here to hang out at a friend's place.

11
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:54,857
Seriously? It wasn't anything after all?

12
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:58,277
I don't think so.

13
00:00:58,577 --> 00:00:59,387
What?

14
00:00:59,388 --> 00:01:00,647
How can you tell?

15
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:03,157
Take a look at this.

16
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:05,466
This apartment building was built recently.

17
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:07,287
No one lives here yet.

18
00:01:07,537 --> 00:01:08,807
I see.

19
00:01:10,017 --> 00:01:14,707
The question now is which floor is Detective Chiba staked out on?

20
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:24,637
The button with the most scratches on it is...

21
00:01:26,137 --> 00:01:28,177
This one. He's on the fourth floor.

22
00:01:31,977 --> 00:01:38,077
If we find a room with a lot of scratches on its doorbell, then...

23
00:01:40,197 --> 00:01:41,826
In other words, this room.

24
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:42,887
There.

25
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:47,757
Hey!

26
00:01:47,757 --> 00:01:48,657
What?

27
00:01:49,637 --> 00:01:50,796
What is it, Chiba?

28
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:53,077
Hey, Detective Takagi is here, too.

29
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:54,546
Hello.

30
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,456
We spotted Detective Chiba, so we decided to follow him.

31
00:01:57,457 --> 00:01:58,706
You're on a stakeout, right?

32
00:01:58,707 --> 00:02:00,087
We'll help.

33
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:02,477
What?!

34
00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:05,336
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

35
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:07,537
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

36
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:09,796
Entering the location of a stakeout,

37
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,766
the Detective Boys get involved in a case!

38
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:13,396
Always determining the one truth

39
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:15,156
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

40
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:17,697
his name is Detective Conan!

41
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:01,197
"Stakeout!"

42
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:09,556
Conan-kun, you're not supposed to be here.

43
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:10,887
You brought all your friends, too.

44
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:15,016
How did you know we were on a stakeout?

45
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:20,106
We happened to see you doing a lot of shopping at a convenience store.

46
00:04:20,107 --> 00:04:22,647
It seemed unnatural, so we followed you.

47
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:28,366
When you entered this apartment building, you stopped to look behind yourself.

48
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:31,117
You seemed interested in the apartment building across the street.

49
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:34,537
That's the location you're staking out, right?

50
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:41,256
Well, yeah. But we don't have time for you kids right now.

51
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:44,957
You can't stay here. We're working.

52
00:04:45,297 --> 00:04:46,696
What?!

53
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:49,706
The professor will come pick us up soon.

54
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,047
Can't we stay until then?

55
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:54,097
Uh... What should we do?

56
00:04:56,427 --> 00:04:57,826
We don't have a choice.

57
00:04:57,827 --> 00:05:00,517
You can stay until the professor arrives.

58
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:02,807
All right!

59
00:05:04,877 --> 00:05:06,687
You can have some drinks and snacks.

60
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,857
Thank you!

61
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:16,507
Are the third floor residents of the building across the street the subjects of their stakeout?

62
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:20,917
Rooms 301 and 305 are unoccupied.

63
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,627
First, there's the resident of room 302.

64
00:05:27,897 --> 00:05:29,947
Next, room 303.

65
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:33,227
Nobody's home right now. Have they gone out?

66
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:37,167
Finally, room 304.

67
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:41,027
Currently there's a single woman inside.

68
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:46,397
Why are you only watching the three middle rooms on the third floor?

69
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,637
What?

70
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,136
Oh, we're on a stakeout because we're looking

71
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:53,657
for the person who robbed a jewelry store.

72
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:56,676
Did that happen last week?

73
00:05:56,677 --> 00:06:02,266
I saw on the news that a robber entered a jewelry store in Haido City

74
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:03,577
and ran off with their jewels.

75
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:06,856
When the robbery took place,

76
00:06:06,857 --> 00:06:10,087
the residents living on either end were in the hospital or traveling, so they have alibis.

77
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:13,587
So, which of the residents of those three rooms did it?

78
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:17,347
We're on a stakeout because we don't know yet.

79
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:21,847
How did you know the culprit lives in the apartment across the street?

80
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:23,097
Because...

81
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:25,066
Several days ago,

82
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:29,987
a serial burglar was caught red-handed.

83
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:39,167
Inside the burglar's bag were rings stolen from the jewelry store.

84
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:45,377
They found four total: one ruby, one sapphire, one onyx, and one diamond.

85
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:49,036
The burglar testified that they burglarized all the third floor rooms

86
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:54,456
in the apartment building across the street and stole the rings.

87
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:58,677
But he couldn't remember which room the rings came from.

88
00:06:59,597 --> 00:07:00,916
I see.

89
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:03,747
Sounds like a greedy burglar.

90
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:24,197
Is he afraid of the phone?

91
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:28,007
That's Kuwai Tsunahiko-san of room 302.

92
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:31,447
He's been acting like that ever since we started the stakeout.

93
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:36,217
Of all the suspects, he moved here most recently.

94
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:38,357
We don't have much information on him.

95
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:46,227
The person living in room 303 has returned.

96
00:07:47,457 --> 00:07:50,727
That's Hanai Mitsuki-san of room 303.

97
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,267
He's a salaryman who works at a trading company.

98
00:07:53,687 --> 00:07:57,357
He returned home after buying dinner at a nearby supermarket.

99
00:07:57,537 --> 00:07:59,937
He returned exactly when he usually does, too.

100
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:07,497
That's odd. Who goes out onto their balcony as soon as they come home?

101
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:11,766
Normally you'd ask your mom what's for dinner first.

102
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:14,726
Genta-kun, don't you mean you wash your hands first?

103
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,977
What? Oh, right.

104
00:08:17,757 --> 00:08:18,507
Look!

105
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:27,807
Could it be?

106
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:29,847
Kids, move back.

107
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:31,227
He's on his guard.

108
00:08:31,607 --> 00:08:34,016
No way. Do you think he noticed us?

109
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:35,356
Genta-kun, shush.

110
00:08:35,357 --> 00:08:36,687
Sorry.

111
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,107
Could it be? But that's not possible.

112
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:41,487
Come to think of it, Hanai-san went out onto his balcony

113
00:08:41,907 --> 00:08:44,606
as soon as he got home yesterday as well.

114
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,737
You're right.

115
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:48,676
Hanai-san went back inside.

116
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:51,117
His neighbor is back in her living room, too.

117
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:56,496
Amano Kasumi-san of room 304.

118
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:57,377
She works as—

119
00:08:57,378 --> 00:08:59,396
I know! She's a yoga teacher!

120
00:08:59,397 --> 00:09:00,477
Correct.

121
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:05,307
Looks like she has a visitor.

122
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:07,636
We've never seen him before.

123
00:09:07,637 --> 00:09:09,806
Maybe that's her boyfriend.

124
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:11,957
He's probably the eel deliveryman.

125
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:13,807
Nah, I guess not.

126
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:18,876
But how can we find evidence indicating who is the culprit?

127
00:09:18,877 --> 00:09:23,397
The robber must've taken items other than the rings.

128
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:27,327
It's hard to imagine that they sold everything in such a short amount of time.

129
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:31,356
The robber is probably panicking because they were burglarized.

130
00:09:31,357 --> 00:09:34,586
They probably want to get rid of the remaining evidence quickly.

131
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:36,957
We'll just have to wait for them to give themselves away.

132
00:09:37,097 --> 00:09:40,926
What? There's no telling when that will happen.

133
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:42,606
I can't help that.

134
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:44,697
Any ideas?

135
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:50,626
Good idea.

136
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:52,437
Let's do it.

137
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:56,017
Conan-kun, why don't we get going?

138
00:09:56,207 --> 00:10:00,817
What? But we wouldn't want to miss the professor.

139
00:10:00,997 --> 00:10:04,106
Then you wait for the professor.

140
00:10:04,107 --> 00:10:07,577
It's late for us, so we're going to go.

141
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:10,077
Will you three be okay on your own?

142
00:10:10,397 --> 00:10:12,327
Yeah. Excuse us.

143
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:14,997
Be careful on your way home.

144
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:17,587
Sure. Later, Conan.

145
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,187
Uh, later...

146
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:34,657
Hello?

147
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:37,637
I know.

148
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:42,267
Today I'll do whatever it takes.

149
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:57,157
Takagi-san.

150
00:10:57,717 --> 00:10:59,826
They're all getting ready to go out.

151
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,876
Perhaps they're making a sale.

152
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:04,007
I can't believe they're all going out at the same time.

153
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:07,056
We can't follow all three of them.

154
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:08,576
Should we call for backup?

155
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:11,007
I don't know if they'd make it in time.

156
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:14,017
Damn. Isn't there anything we can do?

157
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:17,187
In any case, get in touch with Inspector Megure.

158
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:22,157
Huh? What are they doing?

159
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:33,657
Conan, can you see us?

160
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:36,436
Let us handle this.

161
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:37,667
What are you doing?

162
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:39,146
Get back here immediately!

163
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:40,596
We'll be fine.

164
00:11:40,597 --> 00:11:43,406
We're just going to check out the rooms a little bit.

165
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:45,696
We have an idea.

166
00:11:45,697 --> 00:11:46,437
What?

167
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:48,677
Genta!

168
00:11:51,237 --> 00:11:52,727
Get back here!

169
00:11:53,257 --> 00:11:56,266
There's someone standing in front of room 302.

170
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:58,647
Hey, I know you're in there!

171
00:11:58,857 --> 00:11:59,937
Open up!

172
00:12:01,817 --> 00:12:03,146
Who are you?

173
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:09,267
Um, my ball is on the balcony of that room.

174
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:15,357
I see. You came at exactly the right time.

175
00:12:15,957 --> 00:12:18,037
You're going to help me.

176
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:19,907
What?

177
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:27,076
Damn. I can't hear him clearly.

178
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:28,946
Genta-kun entered the room.

179
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:29,547
What?

180
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:36,557
What's going on? Are they arguing?

181
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:41,676
They're saying some pretty ominous sounding stuff about "dead lines."

182
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,787
I'm going to look around for the jewels.

183
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:49,377
What's that?

184
00:12:50,577 --> 00:12:51,976
That's it.

185
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:56,577
Kuwai-san is probably an author, and that's his editor.

186
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:58,406
I see.

187
00:12:58,407 --> 00:13:00,826
Genta-kun misunderstood what they said,

188
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:02,957
and the room doesn't feel lived in because...

189
00:13:03,137 --> 00:13:05,707
He's renting it for work.

190
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:10,846
He packed that suitcase because he was dissatisfied with his job

191
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:12,827
and was planning to run away.

192
00:13:14,857 --> 00:13:15,757
Huh?

193
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:17,067
What is it?

194
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:19,847
Mitsuhiko-kun is missing.

195
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:22,096
Mitsuhiko, get back here!

196
00:13:22,097 --> 00:13:23,607
Excuse me.

197
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:27,287
My Frisbee is on your balcony.

198
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,996
What? Frisbee?

199
00:13:30,997 --> 00:13:33,366
Give me a second. I'll go check.

200
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:35,367
Wait a minute.

201
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:37,386
Enough, Mitsuhiko-kun!

202
00:13:37,387 --> 00:13:39,367
What? I'll go get it for you.

203
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:44,177
Are you perhaps worried about something?

204
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:45,877
Mitsuhiko!

205
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:54,637
I saw you looking around from your balcony earlier.

206
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:58,767
Come in.

207
00:13:59,237 --> 00:14:01,017
Will he be all right?

208
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:03,787
Um...

209
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:07,776
Uh...

210
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:09,856
What's the real reason you came here?

211
00:14:09,857 --> 00:14:11,527
What? Um...

212
00:14:11,897 --> 00:14:14,527
Do you...

213
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,017
know something

214
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:20,147
about my Daiya?

215
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:23,156
What did you see on my balcony?

216
00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:25,077
This isn't good!

217
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:27,337
We have to distract him somehow!

218
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:30,827
Uh...

219
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:35,827
What's that light?

220
00:14:36,137 --> 00:14:38,507
Run, Mitsuhiko-kun!

221
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:42,887
Large Sunflower Seeds

222
00:14:53,157 --> 00:14:54,757
So that's what happened.

223
00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:56,337
What do you mean?

224
00:14:56,887 --> 00:15:00,817
When did Daiya-chan go missing?

225
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:03,907
Could you tell me about it?

226
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:06,176
That's it. I figured it out.

227
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:06,847
What?

228
00:15:06,848 --> 00:15:09,167
I know why Hanai-san was cautiously looking out from his balcony.

229
00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:12,276
Three days ago.

230
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:14,966
I was cleaning Daiya's room.

231
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:17,677
I carelessly allowed him to fly away.

232
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:22,837
Something probably scared him, but it was my fault.

233
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,386
I wonder where he is right now.

234
00:15:25,387 --> 00:15:27,267
I hope he's not hurt.

235
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:29,686
I hope he's not hungry.

236
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:31,797
I'm so worried about him.

237
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:36,026
That's why you scattered food on the railing of your balcony

238
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:38,197
and were waiting for him to come home.

239
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:39,637
Yeah.

240
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,376
Maybe I'm just doing it to ease my mind,

241
00:15:41,377 --> 00:15:44,927
but I'm doing it in the hope that it'll bring him home.

242
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:49,497
But Daiya still hasn't come back.

243
00:15:50,747 --> 00:15:54,007
I was just on my way out to look for him again today.

244
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:55,816
You'll find him.

245
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:58,927
No, I'm sure he'll come home.

246
00:15:59,587 --> 00:16:00,796
Thanks.

247
00:16:00,797 --> 00:16:04,857
By the way, did you see that light across the street just now?

248
00:16:05,307 --> 00:16:09,517
Oh, that's a new building. It's probably still under construction.

249
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:11,196
Great.

250
00:16:11,197 --> 00:16:12,917
He managed to play it off.

251
00:16:15,627 --> 00:16:16,777
Ayumi-chan, too?!

252
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:18,187
Ayumi-chan!

253
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:20,566
Conan-kun, can you hear me?

254
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:24,697
That man might not be that lady's boyfriend.

255
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:27,236
It sounds like they're arguing in her apartment.

256
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,457
Can you hear them?

257
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:32,856
Could you stop doing that? I'm a rush to sell them, too!

258
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:35,726
I'm the one finding you a buyer!

259
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:37,887
Sell? Buyer?

260
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:41,167
Coming!

261
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:44,337
Oh, my.

262
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:49,227
Good evening. My stuffed animal fell on your balcony.

263
00:16:49,657 --> 00:16:51,616
Were you on your way out?

264
00:16:51,617 --> 00:16:55,977
Huh? Uh, yeah, for work. It's all right, though.

265
00:16:56,317 --> 00:17:00,916
Work? Is that man planning on going with her to her lesson?

266
00:17:00,917 --> 00:17:04,237
He could be her manager or business partner.

267
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:06,867
Wow.

268
00:17:07,237 --> 00:17:09,816
You have so many yoga mats.

269
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:10,497
Don't!

270
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,497
Try not to touch anything.

271
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:20,336
I use those for work.

272
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:22,136
I sell them.

273
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:23,507
So, you know.

274
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:26,507
They're yoga mats designed and produced by her.

275
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:30,726
She's on edge because she's worried whether they'll sell or not.

276
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:32,517
Go easy on her.

277
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:34,256
I see.

278
00:17:34,257 --> 00:17:37,277
I'm sorry I touched them without knowing the full story.

279
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:39,846
Oh, so that's what it is.

280
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:41,866
He's her business partner?

281
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:43,277
Seems that way.

282
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,277
Is this your stuffed animal?

283
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:58,236
Here. Make sure you don't lose it again.

284
00:17:58,237 --> 00:17:59,417
Thank you.

285
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:02,136
It's late. You should hurry home.

286
00:18:02,137 --> 00:18:02,877
Okay.

287
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:05,586
Not here either?

288
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:08,706
I didn't see anything particularly suspicious.

289
00:18:08,707 --> 00:18:11,886
Enough, guys. Get back here immediately.

290
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:13,137
Roger that.

291
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:14,767
Got it.

292
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:21,147
Let's continue with the stakeout and see how things go.

293
00:18:26,697 --> 00:18:27,767
Ayumi-chan?

294
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:29,827
What was that voice?

295
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:35,077
What is this thing? I thought I heard a voice.

296
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:37,656
It sounded like a kid.

297
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:39,417
That's the feeling I got.

298
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:41,467
Conan-kun, stay here!

299
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:49,366
This doesn't look like a child's toy.

300
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:51,717
To be on the safe side, should we take care of it?

301
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:54,597
Take care of it? What are you going to do to it?

302
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:59,977
Dunking it in water will probably break it or prevent it from picking up anything.

303
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:02,357
Hey!

304
00:19:04,697 --> 00:19:06,317
Why are you running?

305
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:12,867
What did you come here to do?

306
00:19:13,177 --> 00:19:14,617
What's going on?

307
00:19:18,427 --> 00:19:21,807
Why don't you tell us why you came here?

308
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:23,877
Police!

309
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:27,436
You're under arrested for robbing a jewelry—

310
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:28,537
Stay back!

311
00:19:29,097 --> 00:19:31,387
Don't you care what happens to the kid?

312
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:33,887
Help!

313
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:35,686
Ayumi!

314
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:37,337
Detective Chiba!

315
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:40,026
Catch Ayumi-chan!

316
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:41,477
What? You got it!

317
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:53,157
Go!

318
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:05,147
Ayumi, are you okay?

319
00:20:07,347 --> 00:20:09,547
Thank you, Detective Chiba.

320
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:12,847
Great.

321
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:16,847
Ayumi-chan, are you hurt?

322
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,466
I'm fine. I'm not in any pain.

323
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:22,466
Are you okay?

324
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:26,857
My back hurts a little, but I'm fine.

325
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:29,107
Great.

326
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:31,076
Ayumi-chan!

327
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:32,617
Conan-kun!

328
00:20:33,737 --> 00:20:35,067
Great.

329
00:20:59,337 --> 00:21:00,687
I'm home.

330
00:22:25,217 --> 00:22:26,777
Welcome.

331
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:35,057
You can never have too many of these.

332
00:22:38,327 --> 00:22:39,976
Huh? What?

333
00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:41,366
We saw you.

334
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:42,986
Red bean rolls and milk.

335
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,926
You must be on a stakeout.

336
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:48,337
We'll help you again.

337
00:22:48,837 --> 00:22:51,967
It's not like that. This is my dinner.

338
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:53,507
Oh, really?

339
00:22:53,657 --> 00:22:55,187
Yes, really.

340
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,376
Hold on.

341
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:01,267
Didn't you kids just recently get scolded for putting yourselves in danger?

342
00:23:03,637 --> 00:23:05,507
Yes...

343
00:23:07,187 --> 00:23:10,656
But because of us, the case was solved.

344
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:12,277
You could say that.

345
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:16,087
And you'll protect us if we're ever in danger.

346
00:23:16,277 --> 00:23:18,776
What?!

347
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:20,287
That's right!

348
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:24,037
These kids never learn.

349
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:27,576
We're counting on you, Detective Chiba!

350
00:23:27,577 --> 00:23:29,336
Ow!

351
00:23:29,337 --> 00:23:33,416
The items we just put in your basket are to celebrate solving the case.

352
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:36,086
Thanks for paying.

353
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:38,847
We'll help you anytime you need it.

354
00:23:40,727 --> 00:23:43,707
Detective Chiba, I'm sorry.

355
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,387
What's this?

356
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:55,567
Inspector Megure, you heard him. What should we do?

357
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,886
Call the railway company.

358
00:23:57,887 --> 00:24:02,537
We're going set up checkpoints at all Toto Station exits.

359
00:24:02,737 --> 00:24:04,997
The shooter's location was probably...

360
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,417
This smell...

361
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:14,107
The next episode of Conan is "The Monorail Sniper Case, Part One!"
