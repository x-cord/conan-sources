1
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:05,677
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,678 --> 00:00:07,377
They can be the culprit or the actor.

3
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:08,977
A killing occurs in a magician's house.

4
00:00:08,978 --> 00:00:10,277
Magic, gimmick or trick.

5
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:12,377
Conan and Heiji solve it, both together!

6
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:13,777
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,778 --> 00:00:15,577
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:17,878
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54,938 --> 00:01:56,137
After going through

10
00:01:56,138 --> 00:01:58,437
some incident at Dogo Hoshikawa's magic show,

11
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,437
we were invited to Mr. Masakage, a legendary magician's house.

12
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:05,637
Also, it happened to be the day.

13
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:10,937
Mr. Masakage suddenly disappeared 10 years ago.

14
00:02:10,938 --> 00:02:14,437
We were at Mr. Masakage's house with his pupils.

15
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:17,937
If we're really going to do a show together,

16
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:21,537
the highlight of my magic will be "Witch Reborn"!

17
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:22,937
What?

18
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:26,337
I'm gonna place a huge cross in the middle of the audience

19
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:29,537
and tie myself to it.

20
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:32,237
I'll have the audience fire it up,

21
00:02:32,238 --> 00:02:36,137
and before the cross burns out, I'll vanish.

22
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:40,038
Next time you see me is when I emerge out of the ashes.

23
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,338
Maybe the light bulb burned out.

24
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:49,438
Okay, I found it.

25
00:02:59,538 --> 00:03:05,338
"Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (House)"

26
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:10,038
Oh god. What was that scream?

27
00:03:10,838 --> 00:03:12,038
Was that the second floor?

28
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:14,937
What's wrong?

29
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:16,637
Tenko's in trouble!

30
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:19,337
She's bleeding from her head. She's not moving!

31
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:20,638
Are you serious?

32
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:25,937
Shoots. Her body's already cold.

33
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:27,238
Oh no.

34
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:29,937
Tenko!

35
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:31,337
Oh my god.

36
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:35,237
It looks like it's been more than 30 minutes since she died.

37
00:03:35,238 --> 00:03:36,637
So, you two found her?

38
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:38,637
Well, Mr. Hoshikawa was with us too.

39
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:41,838
He just went into that room to call the police and ambulance.

40
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:46,337
Will you please hurry? Please!

41
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:48,538
Okay. Yeah.

42
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,838
Hey, Hattori, look.

43
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:54,638
The window is open.

44
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,837
If the murderer did jump off the window into the shrubbery,

45
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:05,237
he could easily run away from the rear gate.

46
00:04:05,238 --> 00:04:06,937
Heiji, come over here!

47
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:08,637
What is it?

48
00:04:08,638 --> 00:04:11,037
You gotta see what happened to the room next to the one.

49
00:04:11,038 --> 00:04:13,437
Tenko was found lying on the floor!

50
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:14,638
What?

51
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:17,537
What the heck is this?

52
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:19,637
Tell me, what is this room?

53
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:24,337
Mr. Masakage traveled all around the world.

54
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:26,437
Those are the documents on magic that he collected.

55
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:29,037
Is there anything that's really important in this room?

56
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:31,337
No. It's mostly clippings from books and magazines

57
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,537
that you can find in any bookstore.

58
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:36,637
He used to show us those clippings.

59
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:42,337
If any, it would be the file which even I wasn't allowed to see.

60
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:48,537
It is Mr. Masakage's notes on all the gimmicks about his original tricks.

61
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,938
We call it "Masakage's notes".

62
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:54,538
Masakage's notes.

63
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:03,437
Hey, look who's here.

64
00:05:03,438 --> 00:05:04,537
When did you get here?

65
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,337
Oh, just this morning!

66
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:09,537
I came here just to see a magic show today

67
00:05:09,538 --> 00:05:12,537
because this stupid girl said

68
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:16,437
"I feel like watching some miracles" or whatever.

69
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:18,637
Don't call me stupid, stupid!

70
00:05:18,638 --> 00:05:23,137
Actually, the fact that I always see you at crime scenes is a miracle.

71
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:25,437
All right. So why were you in this house?

72
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:27,637
We met three magicians at the magic show,

73
00:05:27,638 --> 00:05:30,737
and they invited us to their master's house, which is here.

74
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:35,337
And then, one of them happened to be murdered by somebody.

75
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:38,737
So the lady who was murdered was also a magician?

76
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,238
Her name is Tenko Himemiya.

77
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:43,837
She was pretty famous outside Japan.

78
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:46,037
We were just planning to have a collaboration magic show

79
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:48,337
all the three of us together.

80
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:50,537
But I never thought it was gonna be like this.

81
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:53,137
Okay. So who found her first?

82
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:55,938
Me, and those ladies over there.

83
00:05:57,138 --> 00:06:01,237
Dinner was ready, so we went to call Tenko.

84
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:04,937
This is her master's room. We thought she might be here.

85
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:09,837
When we came up here, there was nothing in the hallway at first.

86
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:13,837
But when I turned on the light since it was dark, the breaker went down,

87
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:17,437
and after the light turned back on,

88
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:20,137
Tenko was lying at the end of this hallway, just over there.

89
00:06:20,138 --> 00:06:21,437
I see.

90
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:23,337
The fact that this hallway was dark

91
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:25,137
was part of this homicide plan, I think.

92
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:27,937
The killer loosened the light bulb beforehand.

93
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:31,537
So if somebody comes to the hallway, turn on the light

94
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:33,738
and cause a blackout.

95
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:38,537
I found that some work was done on this switch to trigger a short circuit.

96
00:06:38,538 --> 00:06:40,437
Also, beside the dead body

97
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:43,537
is the reference room where the important file was stored.

98
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:46,337
And there is no window in that room which people can go in and out of.

99
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:49,937
One more thing, the window in Mr. Masakage's room was left open.

100
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:51,637
Considering all these,

101
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:55,437
it is likely that the person manipulated the switch

102
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:58,437
so he can safely steal Masakage's notes and run away.

103
00:06:58,438 --> 00:07:00,137
To run away?

104
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:02,037
That's right. If the breaker has goes down,

105
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:05,438
somebody has to reset the breaker on the first floor, right?

106
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:10,437
While somebody is downstairs, the murderer jumps out of

107
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:14,538
the window of Mr. Masakage's room and runs away.

108
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:19,537
But it didn't go like the murderer planned.

109
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:23,337
In this house, there's usually only one woman living alone.

110
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:25,737
But today, she had seven guests.

111
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:29,437
Not only that, Tenko came into the reference room

112
00:07:29,438 --> 00:07:31,537
without turning on the light,

113
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:36,337
and saw the murderer, so he had to kill her.

114
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:40,837
After that, the murderer went back to searching for Masakage's notes.

115
00:07:40,838 --> 00:07:44,137
But now, other visitors came by, Kazuha and the others

116
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:45,737
came up to call Tenko.

117
00:07:45,738 --> 00:07:47,537
Fortunately for him, the breaker had gone down.

118
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:50,837
So he put Tenko's dead body in the hallway and ran away.

119
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:53,537
There was a plenty of time to run away

120
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:57,237
because the people were struck with the dead victim.

121
00:07:57,238 --> 00:08:00,337
-I see. -Well, if you think logically,

122
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:02,837
it seems that an outsider committed this crime.

123
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:05,037
Although he failed to steal the notes,

124
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:07,637
-there is one possible suspect among us. -Among us?

125
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:12,137
It's the person who caused the blackout. Mr. Hoshikawa!

126
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:13,237
What?

127
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:15,737
You were here during the blackout.

128
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:17,637
It wasn't that hard for you

129
00:08:17,638 --> 00:08:20,837
to move Tenko from the reference room to the hallway,

130
00:08:20,838 --> 00:08:22,937
then go back to where the girls were

131
00:08:22,938 --> 00:08:26,537
-before the lights turned back on, right? -That's impossible! I think.

132
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,438
-Right? -Yeah.

133
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:30,937
Because...

134
00:08:30,938 --> 00:08:35,238
We were holding Mr. Hoshikawa while the power was out.

135
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:37,737
Holding him?

136
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:39,837
-Why? -Why?

137
00:08:39,838 --> 00:08:41,737
What do you mean why?

138
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:44,537
Because it was dark and scary.

139
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:47,937
Are you sure it was this guy?

140
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:49,538
Yes, I am!

141
00:08:52,138 --> 00:08:56,037
I was holding Mr. Hoshikawa's arm like this.

142
00:08:56,038 --> 00:08:59,038
And I was holding Kazuha like this.

143
00:09:00,938 --> 00:09:03,137
See? Mr. Hoshikawa couldn't do it!

144
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:06,737
It's just like the case of Doctor Araide, isn't it, Conan?

145
00:09:06,738 --> 00:09:08,937
-Yes. -Idiot.

146
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:11,137
I mean it was just a mere blackout, and you're not a kid anymore!

147
00:09:11,138 --> 00:09:15,137
Well, Heiji. They're girls. They couldn't help it.

148
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,238
Huh? What's with you?

149
00:09:19,338 --> 00:09:22,837
By the way, where were you during the blackout?

150
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:26,937
I was taking a nap in the room right below the bookroom.

151
00:09:26,938 --> 00:09:32,637
I went into his room to wake him up. That was when the power went out.

152
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:36,037
Okay, then there's no way you guys murdered the victim.

153
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:39,637
So, it is likely that the murderer was an outsider?

154
00:09:39,638 --> 00:09:42,737
Anyway, could you tell us more about that important file?

155
00:09:42,738 --> 00:09:46,037
It's my husband, Mr. Masakage's notes

156
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:49,037
and it is filled ideas on his original tricks.

157
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:51,137
Oh! I remember

158
00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:54,237
I used to watch Mr. Masakage's show on TV when I was a kid!

159
00:09:54,238 --> 00:09:58,637
His magic included beautiful assistants and fantastic illusions!

160
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:01,338
I've have heard that too.

161
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:05,238
God, I still remember it!

162
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,137
Actually, I was his assistant.

163
00:10:09,138 --> 00:10:13,237
Oh, I see. Where is he now?

164
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,837
Somebody told me he disappeared.

165
00:10:16,838 --> 00:10:18,437
Is that true?

166
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:21,437
Yes. It was today 10 years ago.

167
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:24,937
He used to go on outings suddenly without notice.

168
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:27,537
So I wasn't really worried at first.

169
00:10:27,538 --> 00:10:29,737
Half a year past but he never came back.

170
00:10:29,738 --> 00:10:34,137
Hoshikawa, Handa and Tenko are live-in students.

171
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:37,337
But they left and became independent.

172
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:40,437
So this is actually our reunion for the first time in 10 years.

173
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:43,337
So you're the one who called everybody?

174
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:45,637
Actually, it was me.

175
00:10:45,638 --> 00:10:47,037
I told them to come here so that we could discuss

176
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:49,037
the collaborative magic show together.

177
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:52,437
Well, I used to come here on this day every year

178
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:55,437
and have dinner with Mrs. Masakage.

179
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:56,438
All right.

180
00:10:56,439 --> 00:11:02,138
Was there anybody who hated or held a grudge on Mr. Masakage?

181
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:07,637
According to Hattori's deduction,

182
00:11:07,638 --> 00:11:11,237
it is likely that the murderer knew that Mrs. Masakage is living alone,

183
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:16,037
as well as being knowledgeable about the layout of the room and such.

184
00:11:16,038 --> 00:11:20,837
Mr. Masakage's notes would've been worth quite a price, I would figure.

185
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:23,537
Would somebody who would've been interested in getting a hold of it

186
00:11:23,538 --> 00:11:24,837
ever have come by here?

187
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:27,537
But master is not the kind of person

188
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:29,837
anyone would want to hold a grudge against.

189
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:33,737
Actually, there was a man

190
00:11:33,738 --> 00:11:37,537
who visited here many times, saying that he wanted to see my husband.

191
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:39,737
I just thought he was one of his fans, so I let him in.

192
00:11:39,738 --> 00:11:41,937
But as soon as he went into my husband's room.

193
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:43,537
He started yelling,

194
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:48,337
"Come out, you thief! You stole my trick!"

195
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:51,537
Like this.

196
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:54,537
Handa, I told you about this story before, didn't I?

197
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:56,837
Yes, I think you did.

198
00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:59,137
What did the man look like?

199
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:02,437
Oh, it was 5 years ago. I don't really remember how he looked.

200
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:07,037
The layout of the house seems to have changed a bit after that incident.

201
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:09,137
Although it could just be my imagination.

202
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:11,038
The layout has changed?

203
00:12:11,838 --> 00:12:13,337
Ran, what's wrong?

204
00:12:13,338 --> 00:12:17,937
I just thought something's changed before and after Tenko was murdered

205
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,637
but I don't know what it is.

206
00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:22,337
Oh, you think so too?

207
00:12:22,338 --> 00:12:24,137
What? You too?

208
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:27,237
Yeah, but I don't know what it is either.

209
00:12:27,238 --> 00:12:30,537
Maybe I should call Shinichi and ask him what it is.

210
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:31,837
Oh?

211
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:34,137
I thought his number was unlisted?

212
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:36,037
Yeah, but he finally gave it to me!

213
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:38,937
Shoots! I didn't turn it off! Where's it?

214
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:40,737
Okay, then call him and ask.

215
00:12:40,738 --> 00:12:43,537
Kudo is a genius!

216
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:45,237
If you tell him about this case,

217
00:12:45,238 --> 00:12:47,238
he'll probably say that he's gonna solve it with Heiji...

218
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:52,037
Sorry, I think I'm going to keep this cell phone

219
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,737
until we crack the case.

220
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:57,938
-Hey! Heiji! Give it back to her! -Hey!

221
00:12:59,938 --> 00:13:02,937
Okay. Now, let's hear the truth behind this murder.

222
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:06,137
Right, Mr. Genius?

223
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:09,337
What do you mean, "truth"?

224
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:10,637
You liar!

225
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:13,737
You said it a while ago. Something that's bugging you.

226
00:13:13,738 --> 00:13:15,337
Yeah. Just a little.

227
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:20,437
First of all, why did the murderer choose today of all the other days?

228
00:13:20,438 --> 00:13:25,637
Yeah. Today is the day Mr. Masakage disappeared 10 years ago.

229
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,737
If the murderer was familiar with the inside details of this house,

230
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:31,537
that person should've been aware that.

231
00:13:31,538 --> 00:13:33,237
Mrs. Masakage would not be alone today

232
00:13:33,238 --> 00:13:35,637
because Mr. Handa had been visiting her every year.

233
00:13:35,638 --> 00:13:38,237
Secondly, why can't we find the splattered blood

234
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:39,737
of the victim, Tenko anywhere?

235
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:41,237
If my deduction is correct,

236
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,837
she must've been murdered in the hallway or the reference room,

237
00:13:43,838 --> 00:13:45,437
but there's no blood whatsoever in these places.

238
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:46,938
You're right.

239
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:51,137
Destruction of evidence seems too well-prepared

240
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:53,537
for a murder that happened accidentally.

241
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:55,837
Yeah. We should be able to find blood

242
00:13:55,838 --> 00:13:57,137
between the tiles on the floor

243
00:13:57,138 --> 00:14:00,637
or in between the spaces of the wooden pillar.

244
00:14:00,638 --> 00:14:01,737
And thirdly...

245
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:03,637
Oh, you mean there's some more?

246
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:05,338
Kazuha.

247
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:09,138
I don't know what it is, but something's bugging me.

248
00:14:11,138 --> 00:14:15,037
You know, she's acting frivolous, lighthearted and all that.

249
00:14:15,038 --> 00:14:17,937
It just irritates me. I can't concentrate on my deduction.

250
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:19,538
Why is it?

251
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,040
Why is it?

252
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,639
Look, I don't think it's about her just being frivolous or lighthearted.

253
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,639
It's more than her just being frivolous and lighthearted

254
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,539
with another guy, don't you think?

255
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,539
Oh yeah! You're right! That must be it!

256
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,439
How did you know, Kudo?

257
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
Huh?

258
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:56,039
-What? -Kudo?

259
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,440
Hattori! What's wrong with you?

260
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,339
No...

261
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,739
Dude, I mean! It's the dude.

262
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,639
That dude on TV said the temperature went up to 39 degrees yesterday.

263
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,139
It was hot, wasn't it?

264
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,239
Oh yeah, I remember I saw something like that on TV

265
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,140
at the airport this morning.

266
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,840
All right. So, why am I feeling irritated? Don't you know?

267
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,140
Kudo.

268
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,040
Hattori. You know what?

269
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,739
Cause you are a kid.

270
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,439
Gosh!

271
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,139
I'm not letting a brat call me a kid, you brat!

272
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,939
Oh, Heiji!

273
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,740
What're you getting all upset over a child for?

274
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,439
Oh, poor Conan!

275
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,439
What do you mean poor Conan?

276
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,639
He's the one who started talking nonsense!

277
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,539
Oh, come on, you're the one.

278
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,239
So, besides your husband's pupils, Mr. Hoshikawa and Mr. Handa

279
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,739
were there any other magician friends of your husband who visited you?

280
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,739
Well, 10 years ago, until my husband disappeared,

281
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,339
many people had been visiting this house,

282
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,139
so I can't really tell who was who.

283
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,239
Since my husband designed and built this house,

284
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,039
he would even invite the people he just met at work over too,

285
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,639
wanting to show this house off.

286
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,539
I see. So he designed and built this house.

287
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,139
Yes. In fact, he showed them not only this house,

288
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,939
but also the tricks that could be done only in this house.

289
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,439
Therefore, even more people came here after hearing about it.

290
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,239
The Christmas tree magic was a really popular one.

291
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,040
Especially during the Christmas season, you know.

292
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,039
Is anything wrong?

293
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,839
No.

294
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,439
Sorry. This has nothing to do with the case, I guess.

295
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,439
Okay. So, could you tell us what kind of trick it was?

296
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,439
Well...

297
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,839
Only master can explain that trick.

298
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,939
But since he's disappeared,

299
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,839
there's no way we can figure out how it works.

300
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,539
The man that you mentioned visited you 5 years ago.

301
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,339
Could you tell us more in detail about him?

302
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:17,939
If he really said that your husband Mr. Masakage stole his trick,

303
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,039
then it is probable that he really wanted to see the Masakage notes,

304
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,939
because that's where he kept his ideas regarding the magic tricks.

305
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:30,139
If we assume the murderer sneaked into this house to steal the notes,

306
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,739
and silenced Tenko, since she saw that person

307
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,939
searching for the notes in the reference room.

308
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,439
It's plausible to think that

309
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,339
the visitor from 5 years ago is the killer.

310
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,639
His height or something characteristic about his face.

311
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,539
Anything. Anything you can remember, Mrs. Masakage.

312
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,839
Yeah, I'm trying but I can't.

313
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,339
Do you remember whether he was Japanese or not, right?

314
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,739
Oh yeah.

315
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,139
He was speaking fluent Japanese, and his hair was black.

316
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,839
I don't know what kind of hair style he had since he was wearing a hat.

317
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,939
Also, he had sunglasses on and his face was covered with a beard.

318
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,540
So I couldn't really tell how he looked. I really can't.

319
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,439
He seemed to be taller than me though.

320
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,439
A face with a beard, wearing a hat, and sunglasses, huh?

321
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,539
Maybe he was disguising himself.

322
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,339
Probably.

323
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,839
Anyway, have you checked whether Masakage's note

324
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,339
have actually been stolen or not?

325
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,739
No. But, I heard that he kept it put away somewhere

326
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,339
in the reference room,

327
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,039
I never knew exactly where it was though.

328
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,539
Maybe it wasn't there from the beginning

329
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,039
because master took it with him when he disappeared.

330
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,539
Okay, then, we should take a look at the photo albums!

331
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,839
Photo albums?

332
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,539
There should be pictures

333
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,839
since there were so many visitors in this house, right?

334
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,039
Maybe we can find the man in those pictures!

335
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,439
Or at least someone that looks like him.

336
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,939
I see.

337
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,039
Mrs. Masakage, where do you keep your photo albums?

338
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,840
In my husband's room.

339
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,939
What is this, Mrs. Masakage?

340
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,939
This door cannot be opened completely.

341
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,039
Oh, that. My husband wanted to make his room big,

342
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,639
so he narrowed the hallway.

343
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,439
He must hate a small rooms.

344
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,939
He was a great magician, but certainly not a great architect.

345
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,340
I see that.

346
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,939
Kudo.

347
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,140
Yeah.

348
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,539
What are you guys doing there?

349
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,540
Oh.

350
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,540
You're not coming in?

351
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,339
How is it, Mrs. Masakage?

352
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,539
Did you find anybody that looks like the man you met 5 years ago?

353
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,339
No. Not yet.

354
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,639
You sure have a lot of pictures, Mrs. Masakage.

355
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,339
Hey, Heiji. I think it's impossible to find the picture of the man

356
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,939
from among these pictures, don't you?

357
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,539
We aren't looking for the man. We are looking...

358
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,040
I found it!

359
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,039
So, this is the Christmas tree magic, huh?

360
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,939
Look, the tree is standing at the end of the hallway.

361
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,539
That's actually where Tenko was lying on the floor, right?

362
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,439
There must be something behind it.

363
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,439
Hey! Look at this, Kudo.

364
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,939
A picture of the three young pupils.

365
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,040
Maybe this is...

366
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,839
She must be hiding something.

367
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,640
What? What is it? What's going on?

368
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,739
It's that. There.

369
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,139
The thing on the ceiling.

370
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,139
Isn't that a screen for a projector?

371
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,039
What about it?

372
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,839
People usually put that kind of screen on the wall, right?

373
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,639
Cause they don't wanna watch it too close?

374
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,939
It's better to watch it that way.

375
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,339
But it's not like that here.

376
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,739
See? It's so far from the wall.

377
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,740
Don't you think it's strange?

378
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,439
You're right. It is strange.

379
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,539
It's no ordinary screen, actually.

380
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,739
It is cut so that people can go through it.

381
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,939
You guys have probably seen it.

382
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,739
You know the trick, when a real person comes out of the screen

383
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,739
that you're watching!

384
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,639
Oh, yeah I know. I've seen it before!

385
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,439
We used that screen for practice.

386
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,839
That's why it's not on the wall.

387
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,739
It was such a long time ago.

388
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,539
You used to come here and practice together.

389
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:27,139
But now, you're on your own. This room is no longer in use.

390
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,339
Without master and this room,

391
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,939
we couldn't have become successful like we are right now, seriously.

392
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,539
Every magic has a gimmick, there is no exception.

393
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,739
And that's why we practice.

394
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:44,339
We practice a lot until nobody can recognize how the trick works.

395
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,239
Who would think that there's a cut on that screen?

396
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,639
It never crossed my mind.

397
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,639
They used to come to this room everyday back then.

398
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,439
They used to check on when they should come out of the screen

399
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,739
and tried to avoid unnecessary shadow on the screen.

400
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,939
Shadow!

401
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,939
Yes, the shadow!

402
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,439
Oh yeah. It was the shadow of the vase. It looked different!

403
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,339
The shadow of the vase?

404
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,939
The moonlight was shining on the vase from behind,

405
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,540
so we couldn't see the patterns on it.

406
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,039
But after the blackout, when we found Tenko's dead body,

407
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,339
the moonlight was shining on the vase from the side,

408
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,639
so we could see the patterns!

409
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,239
It doesn't make sense!

410
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,739
There's no way the moon moves that fast!

411
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,640
The shadow of the vase.

412
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,339
The moonlight. The vase.

413
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,539
Then, the murderer is an outsider.

414
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,839
But why did she lie?

415
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,439
Because she figured out who it was.

416
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,439
From the way Tenko's dead body was placed

417
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,040
and from the way we found her.

418
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,840
What?

419
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,339
There's nothing.

420
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,340
-What? -It vanished?

421
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,139
Next Conan,

422
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,340
"Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (Solution)"

423
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,339
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,139
"Shadow."

425
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,539
Next week, we'll squash the case.

426
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,640
You don't want to squash the case, we need to crack it!
