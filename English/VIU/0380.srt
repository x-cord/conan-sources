1
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:22,966
Today's deduction is really shocking.

2
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:24,566
So complicated and calculated like an art.

3
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:26,266
Find the answer in the snow.

4
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:27,766
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:29,466
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:31,767
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,404 --> 00:02:01,304
"The Murder in the Hot Spring Inn (Part 2)"

8
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:06,528
Asuka went to the outdoor bath around 10pm.

9
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:10,928
And Ema went to the shrine in the garden around 10.30pm.

10
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:13,828
These two victims were killed with the votive dagger.

11
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:17,128
As this murder weapon was found in the outdoor bath,

12
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:21,828
it is plausible to think that Ema was killed first.

13
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:27,228
Plus, there were no footprints outside the shrine in the garden.

14
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:31,228
One must pass the recreation hall in order to get to the outdoor bath,

15
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:33,828
but nobody was seen passing there after 10.30pm.

16
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:35,028
Oh, my.

17
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,728
So these killings were done in the inaccessible spaces.

18
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:38,728
It's the Kimono visit!

19
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:42,428
It was Sakurako who revenged herself on these girls with the Kimono Visit!

20
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:45,928
Sakurako? Who is that person?

21
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:52,228
She's my university friend who committed suicide

22
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:54,528
because they framed her up for selling illegal drugs.

23
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:58,228
You mean Asuka and Ema did it?

24
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:59,428
Yes!

25
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,428
So, it was... it was her revenge.

26
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:04,829
Lieutenant Masaki.

27
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:10,928
In the shrine, we found one of the earrings of the victim missing.

28
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:13,728
Here. This is the one.

29
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:15,929
That's an expensive one.

30
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:20,828
That earring probably costs at least 200,000 yen.

31
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:23,628
400,000 yen as a pair?

32
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:28,028
It's expensive, but it's not enough motive to kill.

33
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:29,728
True.

34
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:30,928
I remember.

35
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:34,528
You were wearing a necklace of the same brand, weren't you?

36
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:39,828
Yes. But I took them off because Ema complained about it.

37
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:43,529
Yes. We found this in Ema's jacket.

38
00:03:44,529 --> 00:03:49,728
We also found that the kimonos and the sashes at the homicide scenes

39
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,628
actually came from the closet, which was not locked at all.

40
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:54,528
So anybody could take them out.

41
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:58,528
Perhaps the murderer must have hidden them somewhere beforehand.

42
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:02,528
Okay, everyone. Could I ask you what you were doing last night?

43
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:04,128
Firstly, Eri.

44
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:08,628
You went to the outdoor bath around 9.30pm and came out around 10.00pm.

45
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:11,428
And Asuka just came in as you left.

46
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:15,428
Right. After that, I went back to my room.

47
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:18,429
I saw Mr. Mouri on the way and we had a little chat.

48
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,229
We did. Actually, you looked great and...

49
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:31,028
And Yoriko, you were working on some stuff on the coverage.

50
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:32,228
So I suppose you saw Eri?

51
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:35,228
Yes, I did. I saw Eri.

52
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:39,928
And after five minutes or so, I saw Ema going to the backdoor.

53
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:42,028
So that was around 10.30pm, right?

54
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:44,829
Did you see anybody else heading there?

55
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:49,128
No, I don't think so.

56
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:53,128
Around that time, Mr. Mouri and the other three went to the outdoor bath.

57
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:55,928
But there was a reserved sign on the door of the female bathroom.

58
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,628
The door was locked.

59
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:00,628
So both of you went back to the recreation room.

60
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:02,128
That's right.

61
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:03,628
Mr. Mouri.

62
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:06,828
Did you hear or see something unusual when you were in outdoor bath?

63
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:08,428
We did.

64
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:12,429
We heard a swash from the female bathroom.

65
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,528
When was it? Around what time?

66
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:18,228
I think it was around 10.50pm.

67
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:20,129
Maybe that was when the killing occurred.

68
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:24,828
We only heard the swash. We didn't hear a scream.

69
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:26,828
Isn't it strange?

70
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:32,128
Maybe the murderer stunned the victim with stun gun before she screamed.

71
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:33,928
Really?

72
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:35,528
It must be!

73
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:39,029
Kid, keep out of the investigation.

74
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:42,428
So Ran and Harumi,

75
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,728
you girls were just playing ping pong in the recreation hall?

76
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:50,528
No. I actually went back to my room to take off my contact lenses.

77
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:52,828
Just for 10 minutes or so.

78
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:54,128
All right.

79
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,828
So nobody passed through the recreation hall while Harumi was away.

80
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,528
Right.

81
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:02,428
It was around 11pm when Mr. Mouri got out of the bath.

82
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:06,428
Around that time, Eri and Yoriko were having a meeting here.

83
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:08,428
Where were you at that time, Mr. Bando?

84
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:12,229
I joined the meeting around 11.15pm.

85
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:18,528
And then, Mr. Mouri found Asuka's dead body in the outdoor bath.

86
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:20,628
Speaking of the paper doll of Kimono Demon,

87
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:23,628
wasn't it there when you first came to the bathroom?

88
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:25,828
No. I'm sure it wasn't.

89
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:29,628
After Asuka was found, Ema was found dead in the shrine in the garden.

90
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,129
Why did she go to the shrine?

91
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:35,228
That's a good question.

92
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,728
Here's the answer.

93
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,828
"Ema. There's something I would like to discuss with you in person.

94
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:44,128
I will be waiting inside the shrine in the garden. Bando."

95
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:48,128
This is ridiculous! I did not write that letter!

96
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:52,128
But in fact, we don't know where you really were until 11.15pm.

97
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:57,628
But what's the motive? Why would I kill them?

98
00:06:57,629 --> 00:06:59,928
Speaking of motive,

99
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:01,728
I think Harumi is the only person who might have had the motive to kill.

100
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,428
No, I don't.

101
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:05,428
I know you hate the victims

102
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:07,328
because of what happened to your friend Sakurako.

103
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:10,128
Besides, you went back to your room to take off your contact lenses.

104
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,728
During that period, you don't have an alibi.

105
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:15,028
No, I didn't kill them!

106
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:16,728
Whoever is the murderer,

107
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:20,128
we have to find out how these killings happened in the closed space first.

108
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:23,428
If the victims were killed with different weapons,

109
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:26,128
a possibility of what could've happened still stands.

110
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:27,328
But why did the murderer

111
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:31,229
make it look like the Kimono Demon did it in the first place?

112
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:37,929
Thanks a lot.

113
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:42,128
We got it.

114
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,028
You mean the necropsy report?

115
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:47,128
Yes. Both victims were killed with the same murder weapon,

116
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,628
the votive dagger.

117
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:50,128
I see.

118
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:53,629
The same murder weapon? Now, we are stuck.

119
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:57,028
So the murder weapons were the same.

120
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:01,328
The bloodstain on the bandana was found to be Ema's blood.

121
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:02,329
Other than that,

122
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,728
the dolls from the scene, the shrine and other areas, and Ema's letter,

123
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:10,228
we couldn't find any fingerprints or information

124
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:11,929
that's related to the suspect.

125
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:14,928
Thank you very much.

126
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:18,528
You're welcome, sir. I will now depart.

127
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:20,729
What are we going to do, Mr. Mouri?

128
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:24,528
Nothing is found?

129
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:28,229
Next. Yesterday, we were at the Kid Sleighing Contest.

130
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:31,128
Hey, move! Move!

131
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:32,828
Looks like fun.

132
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:34,128
What?

133
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:36,429
It's the kids. The kids on the TV.

134
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:40,028
Come on! Move!

135
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:41,129
I got it.

136
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:49,528
That's what it was.

137
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,829
Now, I understand the trick.

138
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:02,429
It's about six inches here.

139
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:21,928
And here,

140
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:26,228
it's about three inches under the snow.

141
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:28,828
Six inches and three inches.

142
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:30,529
But why her?

143
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:42,028
Conan, where were you?

144
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,128
Well...

145
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:45,329
I just went out for a walk.

146
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:49,229
Tokyo Hajime?

147
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:52,228
It's Mr. Bando.

148
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:55,228
Wait a minute. Maybe that person is...

149
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:58,628
Hey! Why are your socks all wet?

150
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:00,028
Why don't we take it to the fireplace and dry them?

151
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:03,028
Wait. Hey, Ran! Wait.

152
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:05,228
Now, I know who did it.

153
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,528
It must be that person.

154
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:09,329
But why?

155
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,049
We have to figure out how and when the paper doll was put here,

156
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,649
if we suspect that person as the murderer.

157
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,949
What is this?

158
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,849
There was nothing there when we came here last time.

159
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,950
It's weird. This thing is kind of cold.

160
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,050
I see.

161
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,049
Is this Takagi? It's me, Mouri.

162
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:50,049
Actually, I want you to do some research on a person. Can you do that?

163
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,050
Mr. Ogura!

164
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,649
There's something Uncle Kogoro wants you to do.

165
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,550
What? Mr. Mouri said it? All right.

166
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,749
If I am right, then that person must be the murderer.

167
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,849
Mr. Mouri, you told us to come here.

168
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,349
What is it?

169
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,949
Of course.

170
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,850
We are going to find out what really happened in this hotel.

171
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,349
So you know who killed the victims?

172
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,249
Who is it?

173
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,049
Let me explain in the order of what happened.

174
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,449
Now first,

175
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,749
it's about Ema, who was killed in the closed shrine in the garden.

176
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,149
Lieutenant Masaki,

177
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,150
could you please turn on the digital camera that's on the tub?

178
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,749
I've been thinking about the picture of the footprints around the shrine

179
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,749
because there was something that kept bugging me.

180
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,549
And this morning, I finally figured out what it was.

181
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,749
What's wrong with this picture?

182
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,749
The footprints are not deep enough.

183
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,750
What?

184
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,249
Yesterday afternoon,

185
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,549
when I walked around the shrine in the garden,

186
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,750
my feet sank down about three inches in the snow.

187
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,349
It kept snowing the rest of the day.

188
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,249
Thus, by the time we got to the shrine around 10.30pm,

189
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:16,549
Ema's footprints should have been at least six inches deep or so.

190
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,149
However, it was about in fact only four inches.

191
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,949
It was too shallow.

192
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,749
I see. But then, why?

193
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,349
Those footprints were pressed from the top.

194
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,549
Pressed? From the top?

195
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,949
Yes, indeed.

196
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,549
Her footprints were found from the backdoor to the shrine.

197
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,949
Ogura and I covered every single one of them with bath towels

198
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,549
in order to preserve them.

199
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:46,249
But what if those bath towels were solid boards or something?

200
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,249
You could walk on it and move around the shrine

201
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,549
without leaving footprints, right?

202
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,449
It's that simple?

203
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,949
It seems that the tricks are always complicated,

204
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,949
but actually they're really not.

205
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,349
The murderer most likely

206
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,749
got a couple of wooden boards which are about three feet long

207
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,350
and moved around putting those boards on top of Ema's footprints.

208
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,949
After killing Ema,

209
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,949
this murderer went back to the backdoor doing the same thing.

210
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,949
This way, the footprints are maintained as it was before.

211
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,449
Except they get bit shallower.

212
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,149
But how did the murderer get to the backdoor, Mr. Mouri?

213
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,849
Yes! Nobody passed the lobby, right?

214
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,649
The murderer walked under the eaves by using the same method.

215
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,149
That's why there're no witnesses or footprints.

216
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,649
According to my investigation from this morning,

217
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,849
coming out from the back door,

218
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,849
the snow on the right side leave footprints about six inches deep.

219
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,449
On the left side, only about three inches deep.

220
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,949
Meaning that the murderer came from a room along the left side of the pass.

221
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,449
So I checked the left side

222
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,350
and found a place where the snow gets deeper again.

223
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,949
Where is it?

224
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,349
It was right in front of your room.

225
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,150
Eri Akechi.

226
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,349
No way.

227
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,950
Eri did it?

228
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,849
Last night,

229
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,149
Eri left the outdoor bath as soon Asuka came in

230
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,249
and went back to her room.

231
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,549
Then, you went up to the shrine from the backdoor

232
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,349
by using the method I explained just now.

233
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,049
You gave Ema a fake letter from Mr. Bando beforehand,

234
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,749
so she'd come to the shrine, then you killed her.

235
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,549
Sure. That way, I could kill Ema.

236
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,249
But it's impossible to kill Asuka, isn't it?

237
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,349
That's true.

238
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,650
You can't use the same trick in the outdoor bath on the cliff.

239
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,250
Plus, nobody passed the recreation hall.

240
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,850
The truth is, it was Asuka who was actually killed first.

241
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,849
Eri stunned Asuka with a stun gun.

242
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,349
She removed Asuka's clothes and killed her with the votive dagger.

243
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,549
Then she threw the dead body in the bathtub with kimono sashes.

244
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,549
She probably stole the dagger the night before.

245
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,549
It doesn't make sense though. Because Asuka was murdered first,

246
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,049
yet the dagger and Ema's bandana were found in the outdoor bath.

247
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,349
That's right. That paper doll thing is, too.

248
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,349
That was a trick using dry ice.

249
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,149
By using a small piece of dry ice,

250
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,749
Eri glued the paper doll onto the crack of the ceiling.

251
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,249
If you know how long it lasts,

252
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,249
it is possible to drop the paper doll whenever you want to.

253
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,049
That's why the paper doll was kind of cold.

254
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,649
Eri asked the general manager to get her a cake everyday

255
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,149
because she wanted the dry ice in it.

256
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,249
I understand the dry ice trick,

257
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,249
but what about the dagger and bandana?

258
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,149
I didn't come to the bathroom.

259
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:06,549
Well, it's possible to move them without coming here.

260
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,950
Let me show you how now.

261
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,650
Yes, I understand.

262
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,449
This is...

263
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,049
These boards came down from Eri's room,

264
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,149
which is on the cliff right up there.

265
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,049
Now, I want you guys to think.

266
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,749
The votive dagger which was used to kill Ema,

267
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,449
and the bandana with her blood on it.

268
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,949
This way, you can move these things without leaving the room.

269
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:57,049
Mr. Mouri heard the swashy sound when the boards got into the water.

270
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,249
That's right.

271
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,049
Using this trick, Eri tried to disguise the order of the murder,

272
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,149
in order to establish her alibi.

273
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,349
But the question is, where did the boards go?

274
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,650
Right.

275
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,050
Here it is, Mr. Mouri.

276
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,549
What is that?

277
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,849
These were the sashes left in the closet.

278
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,149
They are frozen hard though.

279
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:26,649
A sash becomes like this if you soak and leave it outside for a night.

280
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,649
She used the frozen sash to hide her footprints in the snow.

281
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,050
I see. When they are put in the water...

282
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,050
they just turn into normal sashes.

283
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,749
It would look odd if there were just a dead body

284
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,949
and a couple of sashes in the water.

285
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,749
Thus, she put some more sashes into the water

286
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,249
and spread tons of kimono in the shrine.

287
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,049
That way, the murder scene looks more like the folklore of Kimono Demon,

288
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,450
which actually hides the secret of the trick.

289
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,149
That's a very clever deduction.

290
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,450
But where is the evidence?

291
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,750
Show me the sole of your foot.

292
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,950
Show me, would you?

293
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,750
Please, Eri.

294
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,250
All right.

295
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,949
I think I stepped on a nail or something.

296
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,249
I don't think so.

297
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,549
You actually stepped on Ema's earring

298
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,750
which actually dropped in the middle of the fight.

299
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,749
Last night, I told you guys to wait in the hall

300
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,649
while we did some on-site investigation.

301
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,249
However, Eri said it was better to sit on a chair rather than on the floor,

302
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,549
so you guys moved to the lobby.

303
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:52,049
Eri, that's because your foot was bleeding, wasn't it?

304
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,649
That's why you wouldn't want to take off your slippers in the hall.

305
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,549
Do you have evidence that this a wound I got from the earring?

306
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,149
I found the missing earring.

307
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,350
Here!

308
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,449
Conan!

309
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,349
This brand name earring is worth 200,000 yen a piece.

310
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,149
Nice! If her blood is on it, it will serve as evidence!

311
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,249
It's amazing that you found it.

312
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,650
Actually, this is a pendant. I borrowed from Harumi.

313
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,750
Okay. I give up.

314
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,950
I killed Asuka and Ema.

315
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,449
Why did you do such a horrible thing, Eri?

316
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,149
Her name is not Eri. It's actually Chieri.

317
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,149
She's been hiding her real name.

318
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,749
Your last name, "Ake" is a very rare name.

319
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,249
So people think your real name is Akechi Eri, rather than Ake Chieri.

320
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,449
I asked my friend at the Metropolitan Police to do some research on you.

321
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,349
Chieri, you are the real sister of Sakurako Suzuka,

322
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,349
who killed herself five years ago, right?

323
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:18,049
What? Eri and Sakurako are sisters?

324
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,949
As you sisters lost your parents in a fire,

325
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,450
Sakurako was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Suzuka.

326
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,949
Okay, I'll tell you the rest.

327
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,049
When my younger sister Sakurako died,

328
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,649
I was in Boston, trying to become a famous writer.

329
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,849
So it was actually a year later when I heard that she killed herself.

330
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,649
She was a very naive girl.

331
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,849
And because somebody framed her up selling drugs,

332
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,949
she had to kill herself.

333
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,449
Poor Sakurako.

334
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,949
How come she didn't tell me about it?

335
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,550
I'm her sister.

336
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,949
I'm the only family for her in this world.

337
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:04,149
What Asuka and Ema did to my sister was totally unforgivable.

338
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,449
So one day, I came up with the idea of revenge.

339
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,149
I asked my university friend Yoriko

340
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,649
to invite Asuka and Ema to this hotel for coverage of a new TV series.

341
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,349
It was a perfect opportunity to take revenge

342
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,749
disguised by the folklore of the Kimono Demon.

343
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,450
Okay. But do you think Sakurako is happy about it?

344
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,149
There was a person among the three interviewees

345
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,549
that your sister actually trusted from the bottom of her heart.

346
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,249
It was Harumi Fukatsu. If she wasn't here,

347
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,949
I wouldn't have known about your sister's death.

348
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,949
And therefore, would not have suspected you as the murderer.

349
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:48,349
To me, it just feels like it was Sakurako's will that you two met.

350
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,549
By meeting Harumi, it's most likely

351
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,549
that she hoped that you'd stop committing the crime.

352
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,249
Harumi.

353
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,749
Maybe you were possessed by the Kimono Demon.

354
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,350
But I'm sure this isn't what your sister wants.

355
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,250
Huh? Why am I here?

356
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,849
This isn't good.

357
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,150
Oh, no!

358
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,550
Relax and enjoy your luxury moment in the hot spring.

359
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,849
"Next Episode" -Maybe the murderer wanted the combination of the safe.

360
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,049
See?

361
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:06,749
The murderer didn't know the victim left a dying message.

362
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,649
The door of the safe is left wide open.

363
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,349
Then we should work on the four staff who found the opened safe.

364
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,549
What do you mean?

365
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:21,549
Well, Sleeping Kogoro always stands up for the weak.

366
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:27,550
Next Conan, "The Deduction Battle (Part 1)"

367
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,649
Next Conan's Hint:

368
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,450
"Four blocks of marble"
