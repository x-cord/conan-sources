1
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:12,802
Doc is pretty reliable, isn't he?

2
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:14,402
I agree.

3
00:00:14,403 --> 00:00:17,202
To think that he had such a rich friend.

4
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:19,002
I was surprised.

5
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:20,402
It seems that Doc helped

6
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:23,302
that person's company out with his invention.

7
00:00:23,303 --> 00:00:26,102
That's why that person went out of his way to do us this favor.

8
00:00:26,103 --> 00:00:29,302
He makes inventions for adults at times too, does he?

9
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:31,802
Poor thing to say something like that about him.

10
00:00:31,803 --> 00:00:34,602
Thanks to him, we get to practice soccer.

11
00:00:34,603 --> 00:00:38,002
At times his pun quizzes are annoying though.

12
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:41,702
There used to be a mansion standing on that open lot, right?

13
00:00:41,703 --> 00:00:45,302
If the ground is bumpy, won't it be difficult to practice?

14
00:00:45,303 --> 00:00:48,002
There was a downpour last night, too.

15
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:49,302
Right.

16
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:52,302
Thunder struck several times and there was a black-out, too.

17
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,703
It was scary, wasn't it?

18
00:00:57,503 --> 00:00:59,002
Don't worry.

19
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:01,002
No problem, even if it's after rain.

20
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:03,102
Everything besides the pool has been leveled.

21
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:04,703
I hear drainage is good, too.

22
00:01:05,803 --> 00:01:06,803
Huh?

23
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,802
I wonder if it's a case or something?

24
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:13,002
Is the vacant lot up ahead?

25
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:14,003
No.

26
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:18,003
We're headed over there.

27
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:23,602
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

28
00:01:23,603 --> 00:01:25,702
Love and cases come from the same origin.

29
00:01:25,703 --> 00:01:27,802
A strange locked room without a ceiling.

30
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:29,602
The Youth Detective Squad's Deduction Battle.

31
00:01:29,603 --> 00:01:31,202
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:32,902
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:35,203
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:20,106
"Detective Squad's Locked Room Deduction Battle."

35
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:33,368
Doc!

36
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:34,868
Huh?

37
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:36,368
You folks.

38
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:38,468
Doc, what happened?

39
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:42,668
A man was found dead in the pool of this vacant lot.

40
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,569
A murder?

41
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:48,668
I just came here a while ago

42
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:51,468
to unlock the door so you could come in.

43
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:55,269
But to my surprise, I saw a man afloat in the pool.

44
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,268
A corpse was in that pool?

45
00:03:58,269 --> 00:03:59,868
-Yes. -How scary.

46
00:03:59,869 --> 00:04:02,968
Which means that you're the first discoverer, Doc?

47
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,569
Yes, I guess so.

48
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:09,768
We shouldn't get in the way.

49
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:11,369
Let's talk over there.

50
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:15,268
Is it a case? Or is it an accident?

51
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:18,068
Was there water in the pool?

52
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:19,868
Yes, but it's shallow.

53
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:22,268
It's from last night's rain.

54
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:25,068
How big is the pool?

55
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:28,868
It's a family size, so maybe about 10 meters long.

56
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,168
The width having two courses.

57
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:35,068
This gate is the only way to get to the pool?

58
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:36,968
Yes, that's right.

59
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:41,568
But when I came, the gate was securely locked.

60
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:43,868
Who has the key?

61
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:46,768
According to my friend who lent me this place,

62
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:50,068
this is the only key there is.

63
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:53,668
Then, how did the person who died get in here?

64
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,569
Inspector Megure's in a fix because of that, too.

65
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:59,768
How was it?

66
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:00,968
It seems that this entrance

67
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:04,368
hasn't been opened at all for these past three days.

68
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:09,369
But the victim died last night before midnight.

69
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:12,568
Have you confirmed the cause of his death?

70
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:14,468
We'd have to wait till after the autopsy for the details.

71
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:18,069
But the blow to the back of his head seems to have been lethal.

72
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,768
If this is murder,

73
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:24,368
we have no idea as to how the perp fled either.

74
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:26,268
Indeed.

75
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:30,868
In other words, this vacant lot was a locked room without a roof.

76
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:32,968
A locked room.

77
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:36,768
Just saying it gets me excited!

78
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,668
It's okay to get excited,

79
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:39,768
but if it's the site of a crime,

80
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:41,969
we can't use it to practice soccer.

81
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:46,268
But he died in the pool, right?

82
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:48,868
We're not using the pool, you know!

83
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:51,468
I wonder if the Inspector would think so.

84
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:53,468
It's just as Conan says.

85
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:55,868
Be the victim or the perp,

86
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:57,368
in order to go to the site,

87
00:05:57,369 --> 00:06:00,568
you'd have to go through this vacant lot.

88
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,668
It's off-limits until the case is closed.

89
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:06,068
What? Seriously?

90
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:09,268
Our class soccer tournament is next week, you know!

91
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:12,068
Isn't there anything you can do, Inspector Megure?

92
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,068
I feel sorry for you, but no.

93
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:17,868
But, if you the members of the Youth Detective Squad solve the mystery,

94
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:19,769
it'll be a different story.

95
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:23,168
Inspector's cold!

96
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:26,368
After Doc got this all set up for us.

97
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:28,668
It can't be helped.

98
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:32,668
Then let's solve the case!

99
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:35,668
Inspector Megure said so himself, didn't he?

100
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:37,568
Hey. He was only joking.

101
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:40,468
If we figure out how the victim got here,

102
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:42,468
I'm sure the Inspector will have second thoughts, too!

103
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,468
She's right. Let's do it!

104
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:45,469
Okay, let's do it!

105
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,569
It's all for soccer, Conan!

106
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:58,268
Okay! The Youth Detective Squad is on our way!

107
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:01,569
Wait, where do we go?

108
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:05,468
This is the blueprint of this place that I got from my friend.

109
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:06,768
I wonder if this will be of help?

110
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,269
Of course, it will!

111
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:13,968
This gate was locked, right?

112
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:15,168
Beyond the pool on the other side of the fence,

113
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,869
it looks to be a road.

114
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:22,768
An 8th story building seems to be there.

115
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:26,668
No, between it there's a narrow road.

116
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:29,168
That cars can't go through.

117
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:31,268
Can you come from that road,

118
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:32,768
climb the fence and come into the vacant lot?

119
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:33,868
No way.

120
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:37,868
Since the fence is reinforced with glass and barbed wire.

121
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:39,168
Wait.

122
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:40,969
I see a crane truck over there.

123
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:45,968
Next door seems to be getting ready to start construction, too.

124
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:49,468
Then, how about if that crane truck were used?

125
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,468
If you grab on to the tip of it and go over the fence...

126
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:54,068
No, I don't think so.

127
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:57,269
They say that the crane truck came this morning.

128
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:02,868
Right!

129
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:05,868
A pool has a drain, doesn't it?

130
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:08,569
He could've snuck in from there!

131
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:12,568
It wasn't big enough for humans to get through.

132
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:15,168
Besides, it's covered with a lid.

133
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:17,569
On top of that it was stuck with trash.

134
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:21,468
That's why the pool was filled with rainwater.

135
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:24,668
Then, he must've come down from the sky after all!

136
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:28,068
He flew here by helicopter and got down from there...

137
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:30,168
Fly a helicopter in the middle of the night?

138
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:31,968
The noise is going to be unbearable, you know.

139
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,068
-Hey! What are you doing! -Cut out the noise!

140
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:36,769
Cut out the noise!

141
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,668
Maybe if it were a glider, there would be no sound.

142
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,668
You can't possibly land on a cramped place like this.

143
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:47,969
What about if you fly something by radio control?

144
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:51,469
If you fly about 10.

145
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:54,168
I wonder if you can fly that many radio controlled devices

146
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:56,169
and stay in control.

147
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:08,469
Maybe a hot-air balloon would do!

148
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:15,368
Hot air balloons float using air heated by the burners.

149
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:17,769
There was a downpour last night, right?

150
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:22,869
Moreover, there was thunder.

151
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:29,168
Then, what about a blimp?

152
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,268
I like blimps, too.

153
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:34,468
This is not a matter of what you like or don't like!

154
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:39,268
By the way, you guys forgot something important.

155
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:41,068
What is it?

156
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:42,568
You're wondering why he snuck into the pool

157
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:45,468
despite having to overcome all the obstacles before him.

158
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:46,469
Right?

159
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:50,169
Yes, that's right.

160
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:57,968
The victim didn't come into the vacant lot,

161
00:09:57,969 --> 00:10:01,368
but was trying to sneak in somewhere maybe?

162
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:03,569
Don't just give out titbits when you already know.

163
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:08,168
Sneak in somewhere. Where?

164
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:12,669
I see! There was no murderer to begin with!

165
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:15,068
I see.

166
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:18,768
Because the blow to his head was lethal...

167
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:20,968
Yes! I got it, too!

168
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:22,168
Darn it!

169
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:24,768
I don't get it!

170
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:26,168
Here's a hint.

171
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:28,969
At first that pool was empty.

172
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:31,868
Of course.

173
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:35,169
Because the rain during night filled the pool up...

174
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:39,268
I see!

175
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,568
The victim wasn't punched,

176
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:43,368
but came falling from the building next door

177
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:46,469
and bumped his head on the bottom of the pool.

178
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:55,268
To put it exaggeratedly,

179
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:58,368
the murder weapon was the earth.

180
00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:01,268
I think I've read this mystery story somewhere before.

181
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:04,568
Okay! We've solved the case!

182
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:08,569
Let's go tell Inspector Megure to check the building next door!

183
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:13,868
Too bad, members of the Youth Detective Squad.

184
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:16,769
We've already arrived at that conclusion, too.

185
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:20,268
Did you already check the building then?

186
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:21,768
We checked.

187
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:25,168
We undoubtedly check it but...

188
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:27,368
All the windows up to the 7th floor

189
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:30,068
were all fixed fitted and wouldn't open.

190
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:32,368
There's a bay window on the 8th floor!

191
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:34,569
He fell from that window.

192
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:39,069
But that window wouldn't open either.

193
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:57,633
It's true, it won't even budge.

194
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:02,633
I heard unsettling rumours, so I had the windows modified.

195
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,533
Just yesterday.

196
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:07,833
We found out from the questioning, we just did a while ago.

197
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:11,033
Then, where did the man who died fall from?

198
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:12,133
What about the roof?

199
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:14,033
That's not possible either.

200
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:17,833
There's a high fence around the roof,

201
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:21,133
and it's blocked off so that no one can enter.

202
00:12:21,134 --> 00:12:24,533
He couldn't have fallen into the pool from there then.

203
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:27,933
-Yes. -I don't get it!

204
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:29,233
Wait a sec.

205
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:33,533
Maybe the unsettling rumour that the old lady heard...

206
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:35,733
Oh, that?

207
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:37,533
It was on the news.

208
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:40,233
That there's a burglar breaking into buildings.

209
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:41,433
I know about it.

210
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:43,033
It's the Geko Man, right?

211
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:44,233
Yes.

212
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:46,933
If the guy who fell is that Geko Man,

213
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,333
he didn't fall from the window,

214
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,334
but rather from the wall of the building.

215
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:55,833
They call him the Geko Man because he can climb any kind of wall.

216
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:58,733
I was so scared, you see.

217
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:00,433
I understand.

218
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:04,133
It was wise of you to fix fit all your windows.

219
00:13:04,134 --> 00:13:06,333
The man was identified a while ago.

220
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:08,633
It was the Geko Man.

221
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:13,433
Where did the Geko Man practice climbing any kind of wall?

222
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:15,633
I'm sure it's bouldering.

223
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:18,233
Huh? What's this about bolt?

224
00:13:18,234 --> 00:13:19,633
Bouldering.

225
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:21,533
Haven't you seen it on TV?

226
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,033
It's a sport where you climb the bumps

227
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:25,033
that are set out on the wall.

228
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:26,233
I know.

229
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:29,933
There's a training gym in Beikacho, too. It just opened.

230
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,433
Oh, that!

231
00:13:31,434 --> 00:13:36,133
You climb the wall just like in rock climbing with your bare hands.

232
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:38,133
We found that Geko Man

233
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:41,833
seemed to be making money as a street artist abroad.

234
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:43,733
I don't understand again.

235
00:13:43,734 --> 00:13:46,933
They're people who put on performances in the city.

236
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:48,233
In Geko's case,

237
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:51,833
his talent was walking on tightrope from building to building.

238
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,333
That's amazing!

239
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:56,833
But when he was trying to walk on tightrope between two buildings

240
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:59,033
that had a river between them,

241
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:01,734
it seems he failed.

242
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,633
Back then he was petrified with fear

243
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:34,333
that he could never perform the same feat ever again.

244
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:35,533
Since he was unable to make money,

245
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:36,933
Geko Man returned to Japan

246
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:40,033
and decided to burglarize building by using his talent.

247
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:41,933
But he can't sneak into buildings

248
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:43,733
even if he climbs wall, right?

249
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:45,033
That's it!

250
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:48,833
He didn't know that the windows were remodeled.

251
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,833
I'm sure he was planning to break in through the bay window.

252
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:53,933
If he was a serial building burglar,

253
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,433
I'm sure he would've checked beforehand?

254
00:14:56,434 --> 00:15:01,833
I'm sure he would, but the window was remodeled only yesterday.

255
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,033
I see.

256
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:07,333
When he came to check, it was before the remodeling.

257
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:08,933
He went through the trouble of climbing up,

258
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:11,433
but the windows wouldn't open.

259
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:14,033
So he was surprised and slipped?

260
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:15,233
Would a professional fall

261
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:17,033
just because of something like that?

262
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:19,533
Come to think of it, something's not right.

263
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:22,733
But he actually did fall.

264
00:15:22,734 --> 00:15:27,033
That's actually the part that we're not convince of yet either.

265
00:15:27,034 --> 00:15:29,133
As long as we can solve that one point,

266
00:15:29,134 --> 00:15:30,933
the case would be closed.

267
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:33,133
It's a shame.

268
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:35,934
I guess you won't be able to practice tomorrow either.

269
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:42,033
What shall we do?

270
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:44,433
Should we give it up?

271
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:47,233
Who's gonna give up?

272
00:15:47,234 --> 00:15:48,433
That's right.

273
00:15:48,434 --> 00:15:51,133
Let's think up something again together.

274
00:15:51,134 --> 00:15:54,833
Right! Besides, we've got a secret weapon!

275
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,034
Right?

276
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:59,433
They're talking about you.

277
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:00,834
Me?

278
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:06,133
Eye-witness?

279
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:09,533
Yes. I wonder if there was no eye-witnesses?

280
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:14,733
Unfortunately, the entire area had a black-out just around that time.

281
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:17,733
The substation was experiencing trouble because of the thunder.

282
00:16:17,734 --> 00:16:19,433
I'm sure that's the reason.

283
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:22,534
Geko Man was struck by thunder and fell!

284
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:28,233
Isn't that strange?

285
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:31,434
Thunder falls on the top of buildings, right?

286
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,933
No, that!

287
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:35,434
-What? -What?

288
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:38,233
A lightning rod is up there.

289
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:39,433
The lightning rod

290
00:16:39,434 --> 00:16:42,833
should be connected to the ground by a ground wire.

291
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,734
And the Geko Man...

292
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:59,233
But all three lightning strikes struck the substation.

293
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:02,033
Is that so, too bad.

294
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:03,834
Too bad.

295
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:07,133
Hey, how about this?

296
00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:10,133
Geko Man got all the way up to the 8th floor.

297
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:12,333
Yes, and?

298
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:15,833
He looked into the room from the window.

299
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,933
And then?

300
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:20,934
He saw the old lady there.

301
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:25,834
And when she turned around...

302
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:35,633
That's not possible!

303
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:38,333
I know her from before,

304
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:41,333
but she's a quiet, kind old lady.

305
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:45,333
Her legs are weak so she has to use a cane or wheelchair,

306
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:49,533
but she's very neat and loves to wash clothes.

307
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:52,333
She's that kind of person, Mrs. Awaji.

308
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:54,033
I see.

309
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:56,933
Besides, it was during the black-out.

310
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:59,333
He couldn't have seen inside the room.

311
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:01,633
Oh, I see.

312
00:18:01,634 --> 00:18:04,733
You went to the room of that old lady, right?

313
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:09,733
Yes, I'm the one who introduced her to Inspector Megure, too.

314
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:11,233
I'm sorry.

315
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:15,033
My sofa and curtains are drenched.

316
00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:17,433
I was holding the hose while washing clothes

317
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:19,533
but my hands started to shake.

318
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:22,433
What a pain to age.

319
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,533
I'm sorry that you came all this way,

320
00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:27,133
and yet I have no place for you to sit.

321
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:31,033
No, it's okay. Because we'll be leaving soon.

322
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:35,633
In other words, you didn't notice anything?

323
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:39,534
No. I'm sorry, I can't be of help to you.

324
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:42,933
The sofa, the curtains...

325
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:46,133
Everything on the side of the bay window was drenched?

326
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:48,233
But, if it's during the black-out,

327
00:18:48,234 --> 00:18:50,333
she couldn't have seen outside from inside either.

328
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:51,433
You can see, can't you?

329
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:52,434
Huh?

330
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:54,934
If lightning flashes, you can see.

331
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:59,234
It struck a total of three times on the substation too after all.

332
00:19:02,734 --> 00:19:05,034
I see. I got it.

333
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:11,134
What? What did you figure something out?

334
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:35,633
Excuse me, Mrs. Awaji.

335
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:38,633
I'm sorry for barging in on you.

336
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:40,333
As you know,

337
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:43,133
this morning at the pool of the vacant lot,

338
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:45,733
the body of a burglar, known as the Geko Man

339
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:47,733
was found in the pool of the demolished mansion next door.

340
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:51,233
It was initially thought to be a murder case,

341
00:19:51,234 --> 00:19:55,233
but while he was climbing the wall of this condo trying to break in,

342
00:19:55,234 --> 00:19:57,433
it was found that he happened to fall

343
00:19:57,434 --> 00:20:02,133
and hit his head on the bottom of the pool and died.

344
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:05,433
Then, why did Geko Man fall?

345
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,533
Just as his name implies,

346
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:11,433
the Geko Man committed several thefts by climbing the wall

347
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:14,833
and breaking in through windows.

348
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:21,333
It's hard to imagine that Geko Man fall to his death over a mere slip.

349
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:24,533
I'm sure that you were surprised by the thunder last night.

350
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:26,933
Yes, sure thing.

351
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,533
Although the thunder didn't strike,

352
00:20:28,534 --> 00:20:32,133
I think the sound would've been very loud.

353
00:20:32,134 --> 00:20:36,133
Yes, I was just in the midst of washing clothes so...

354
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,333
Then, there was the black-out.

355
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:40,934
You went back to the living room.

356
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:45,934
Just at that time, a thunder bolt flashed.

357
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:57,733
When you looked outside,

358
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:03,633
you saw a man shining in the light glued onto the window.

359
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:07,834
You on reflex tried to shoot water onto the man.

360
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,233
The window wouldn't open

361
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:14,334
so there's no reason why he would get wet.

362
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:26,133
I'm sorry.

363
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:29,533
I didn't plan to do what I did.

364
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:31,033
I know.

365
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:33,534
You're not to blame for anything.

366
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:37,333
Still until the circumstances come clear,

367
00:21:37,334 --> 00:21:40,533
we cannot close the case.

368
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:42,233
That's all there is to it.

369
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,233
Please rest assured.

370
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:46,034
Thank you very much.

371
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:14,134
Here we go!

372
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:17,933
There!

373
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:19,033
Here goes!

374
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:20,433
Pass!

375
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:21,634
Okay! Ayumi!

376
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,233
I can't!

377
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:26,233
Hey! Ayumi!

378
00:23:26,234 --> 00:23:28,533
Just how long are they going to keep this up?

379
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:32,134
I'm sure it'll be till they won't be able to see the ball.

380
00:23:33,434 --> 00:23:35,734
I see.

381
00:23:42,134 --> 00:23:43,533
"Next Episode" -Listen.

382
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:46,833
This cash is to be exchanged for Reina.

383
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:50,733
How's the perp planning to transport the ransom?

384
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:53,533
A hundred million yen is pretty heavy, isn't it?

385
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:57,533
No matter how heavy, it's only about 10 kilograms, no?

386
00:23:57,534 --> 00:24:00,434
If he has a car ready, it's no big deal.

387
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:05,133
We will be there in five minutes.

388
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:06,134
Copy.

389
00:24:06,135 --> 00:24:12,134
