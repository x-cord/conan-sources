1
00:00:00,703 --> 00:00:05,003
"Oh, sushi! Oh, sushi! How happy we are!"

2
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:09,203
"This is the prize for us winning the game we played with Doc."

3
00:00:09,203 --> 00:00:13,303
"At the sushi shop."

4
00:00:13,303 --> 00:00:17,703
"We'll get to eat sea bream, flatfish, squid and tuna."

5
00:00:17,703 --> 00:00:21,703
Well, squid, sea bream, flatfish, whatever!

6
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:24,403
Because the shop we're headed for now has a wide variety of sushi

7
00:00:24,403 --> 00:00:27,003
and is known for being cheap and delicious too!

8
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:28,803
A wide variety.

9
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:30,903
Cheap and delicious.

10
00:00:30,903 --> 00:00:33,603
It's a sushi shop dream come true!

11
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:36,603
Doc.

12
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,903
Don't tell me that the sushi at the shop

13
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:41,003
comes on a rotating conveyer?

14
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:42,603
Her head sure rotates quite quickly.

15
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:46,403
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

16
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:48,803
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

17
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:50,403
The atmosphere changes

18
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:52,703
in a Rotating sushi shop that everyone likes.

19
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:54,303
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:56,303
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:00:56,303 --> 00:00:58,603
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

22
00:02:39,148 --> 00:02:44,273
"Rotating Sushi Mystery (Part 1)"

23
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:47,223
"Senpuken."

24
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:50,923
So, it's a shop where the sushi rotates after all.

25
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:52,923
You promised to take us to a high class sushi shop

26
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,323
because we won the game, right?

27
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:58,423
That's not nice, Doc!

28
00:02:58,423 --> 00:03:00,423
I even only had two servings of rice for breakfast

29
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:03,523
because I wanted to keep myself hungry, you know!

30
00:03:03,523 --> 00:03:05,923
That's more than enough.

31
00:03:05,923 --> 00:03:08,623
Well, maybe you should've thought more of

32
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:11,923
how much everyone was anticipating the sushi.

33
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:14,523
Think of the contents of my wallet too, will you?

34
00:03:17,523 --> 00:03:19,323
Well, it's not something to get so disappointed over

35
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:21,923
because it's delicious, you see.

36
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:24,423
Have you guys ever eaten sushi that comes rotating, or what?

37
00:03:24,423 --> 00:03:26,723
-No. -Me neither.

38
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:28,223
Dad told me that since I'm an Edoite,

39
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:31,223
I should eat sushi at good shops!

40
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:34,223
Well, I guess that's true.

41
00:03:34,223 --> 00:03:36,823
If this is your first time, I'm sure you'd be surprised!

42
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:41,523
Awesome!

43
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:44,723
-The sushi is rotating! -Really!

44
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:47,923
Is it okay to pick up any plate you want?

45
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:49,823
Yes, go ahead!

46
00:03:49,823 --> 00:03:51,823
But once you pick up a plate,

47
00:03:51,823 --> 00:03:53,923
don't ever return it to where it was.

48
00:03:53,923 --> 00:03:55,523
That's bad manners

49
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:57,723
because they add the total of how much was eaten

50
00:03:57,723 --> 00:04:00,723
by counting the different kinds of plates and number of plates there are.

51
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:04,823
But, what if the sushi that you want to eat doesn't come around?

52
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:07,823
Then all you need to do is place an order for it.

53
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:08,923
Just tell Doc what you want

54
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:11,323
and he'll get it to you using the touch panel.

55
00:04:11,323 --> 00:04:13,823
You can order things like miso soup and steamed eggs, too.

56
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:16,523
What kind of sushi would you like to order?

57
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,523
Okay, I want 10 eels then.

58
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:21,923
I'd like mackerel or horse mackerel to start with.

59
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:24,023
I want to eat salmon roe.

60
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:27,023
Hey, hey. One at a time, okay?

61
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:30,723
So this is it!

62
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:32,523
The eels look delicious.

63
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,323
-Dig in. -No, no!

64
00:04:34,323 --> 00:04:36,723
That's some other customer's plate!

65
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:40,223
In this shop, it seems that when the plate that you ordered

66
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:43,323
passes in front of you, it beeps.

67
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:49,523
Here it comes! My eels.

68
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,423
Dig in!

69
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:54,823
It's delicious!

70
00:04:55,923 --> 00:04:58,223
Here it comes!

71
00:04:58,223 --> 00:04:59,823
Salmon roe.

72
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:03,823
Delicious!

73
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:05,623
It sure is good!

74
00:05:05,623 --> 00:05:08,523
What fun! It's good!

75
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:11,123
There couldn't have been a better place than this.

76
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:12,123
Right.

77
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:15,223
It doesn't meet up to the standard of a first class sushi shop,

78
00:05:15,223 --> 00:05:19,123
but for them, it's better for them to have fun while eating.

79
00:05:19,123 --> 00:05:21,423
My eels are coming one after the other.

80
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:23,923
I already took your plate for you, Conan.

81
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,323
See.

82
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:27,323
All salmon roe.

83
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:29,023
I love salmon roe.

84
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:31,923
Eat to your heart's content too, Conan.

85
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:34,123
But I can't that many rows of it.

86
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:36,323
-Yummy! -What a dull play on words.

87
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:42,223
Boy, did I eat.

88
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:45,023
-It was pretty good, wasn't it? -Yep.

89
00:05:45,023 --> 00:05:47,123
Look, there's pudding too!

90
00:05:47,123 --> 00:05:49,323
No joke?

91
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:50,723
Oh, no!

92
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:53,823
-God, watch out, will you? -Sorry.

93
00:05:53,823 --> 00:05:55,423
Huh?

94
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:59,723
There's a strange pattern on the back of the plate.

95
00:05:59,723 --> 00:06:02,323
That's the mark used to automatically get rid of the plates!

96
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:04,323
The pattern is read by the sensor

97
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:08,023
and gets rid of all the sushi that's been going around for some time!

98
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:11,023
It's difficult to tell when the sushi was made just by looking at it,

99
00:06:11,023 --> 00:06:12,823
and of course it's difficult to remember when it was made either!

100
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:17,023
Hey, brats.

101
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:18,623
I hope you didn't drop the plates on purpose

102
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,223
to confuse how much you're supposed to really pay.

103
00:06:22,223 --> 00:06:24,623
Of course I wouldn't do something like that.

104
00:06:24,623 --> 00:06:27,423
I'm sorry. Since this is the first time

105
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:30,023
that these children have ever come to a sushi shop...

106
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,823
Their first time?

107
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:36,023
Which means that they're usually eating delicious sushi all the time?

108
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:39,623
They belong to class way above you, they say.

109
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:42,723
Right, flatfish boy?

110
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:43,823
What?

111
00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:47,123
It's the fish that your wife used to like, boy.

112
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:48,523
Flatfish.

113
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:51,823
Aren't you going to pick it up? Flatfish.

114
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:55,023
I see, I see. This is sea bass.

115
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:58,123
Please stop it, sir!

116
00:06:58,123 --> 00:07:01,423
You're going to be bothering the other customers,

117
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:03,823
so please refrain from making a racket.

118
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,723
Shut up! I don't want a man like you

119
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:08,923
who can't do any better than to cling onto sushi

120
00:07:08,923 --> 00:07:10,323
and be a manager of this shop telling me anything.

121
00:07:10,323 --> 00:07:12,823
That has nothing to do with what I'm saying.

122
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:15,423
I'll see to it that I run you out of business.

123
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:18,323
I may not look it, but I'm a pretty well-known food writer, you know.

124
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:20,623
It would only take a week

125
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:23,523
to drive your shop to close down, you know?

126
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:26,923
For example, like the shop of that woman

127
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:29,823
who's eating sneakily at the edge over there.

128
00:07:30,923 --> 00:07:32,723
What's up, you guys?

129
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:35,323
Stop looking, hey!

130
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:39,123
Okay, I won't charge you for today,

131
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:40,823
so will you please leave?

132
00:07:40,823 --> 00:07:42,423
Free?

133
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:45,923
Okay, I guess I'll eat to my heart's content and leave then.

134
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,323
Sir...

135
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:50,423
What a nasty man.

136
00:07:50,423 --> 00:07:53,023
I don't feel happy anymore.

137
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:55,323
-Let's go home! -I guess so.

138
00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:01,923
It'll be 8,700 yen.

139
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:04,623
They sure ate a lot.

140
00:08:04,623 --> 00:08:06,823
Boy, give me a break.

141
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:10,323
Thank you so very much.

142
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,423
Please bring us here again, Doc.

143
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:14,823
When there aren't any nasty customers, though.

144
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:16,523
Yeah.

145
00:08:24,023 --> 00:08:25,423
Sir?

146
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,723
Are you all right, sir?

147
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:29,723
-What the... -Oh no! Food poisoning?

148
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:33,223
-Hey, don't eat it! Put it back. -Okay.

149
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:35,423
-Let's change shops. -Yeah.

150
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:37,823
Don't move!

151
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:40,123
If you even move a bit from where you are now,

152
00:08:40,123 --> 00:08:42,323
I'm going to tell the police officers who come here about it.

153
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:45,223
Police... sonny?

154
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:48,423
His mouth smells like almond.

155
00:08:48,423 --> 00:08:53,023
This man was poisoned by cyanide.

156
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:55,423
What? Poison...

157
00:08:55,423 --> 00:08:59,723
Moreover, since there are 2 or 3 rice grains on his finger...

158
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:03,923
It's highly likely that poison was mixed into the sushi!

159
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:05,723
Under this special circumstance,

160
00:09:05,723 --> 00:09:08,523
there would have been many chances to do it!

161
00:09:08,523 --> 00:09:09,923
At any rate, Doc!

162
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:12,723
-Hurry and call the police and ambulance! -Okay!

163
00:09:12,723 --> 00:09:16,223
Will you please stop the conveyer belt right away, manager?

164
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,223
Okay!

165
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,923
Stand back!

166
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:22,023
You again?

167
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:23,523
Conan.

168
00:09:23,523 --> 00:09:25,923
Yep, sort of.

169
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:28,023
I thought that the one who the bad luck holder

170
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:30,123
that calls incidents was Mr. Mouri,

171
00:09:30,123 --> 00:09:31,823
but it could be you.

172
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:33,123
No, that's...

173
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:35,223
He's not a bad luck holder!

174
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:37,523
We're members of the Youth Detective Squad!

175
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:39,723
We can't help it if cases just happen to happen!

176
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:43,123
Cases just happen to need us!

177
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:45,323
What's with your haughty attitude?

178
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:48,723
And? Was the poison inside the sushi after all?

179
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:52,723
No. We can't say for sure yet

180
00:09:52,723 --> 00:09:56,323
unless we examine the inside of the stomach of the victim.

181
00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:58,623
According to the report of the forensic officer,

182
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:01,023
the poison seems to have been on the last plate

183
00:10:01,023 --> 00:10:04,023
that the victim took on this part of the plate.

184
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:05,123
So, it's very likely...

185
00:10:05,123 --> 00:10:08,423
I see. The culprit pretended to take the plate

186
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:10,323
and touched it with his/her hand that had poison on it.

187
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:12,923
Then, if the culprit without taking the plate and pass it to him,

188
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:15,423
he or she could've given the poisoned plate to the victim.

189
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,323
Yes, so it seems that when the victim took that plate,

190
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:20,423
his finger was poisoned,

191
00:10:20,423 --> 00:10:24,323
and picked up the sushi and ate it.

192
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:28,323
So, are you sure that nobody moved since this happened?

193
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:31,323
Yes! No one in the kitchen moved either, right?

194
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:34,323
Yeah. Because I made sure no one did after you told me to do so.

195
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:36,223
Okay, let's do a body check then!

196
00:10:36,223 --> 00:10:37,423
If you're sure of what you just said,

197
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:39,623
I'm sure the culprit still has the container with the poison inside,

198
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:43,423
or the poison soaked handkerchief on him or her.

199
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:44,723
Take the customers who were sitting in the lane

200
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:46,423
where the victim was sitting

201
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:48,423
as well as the employees in charge of the lane

202
00:10:48,423 --> 00:10:50,523
-to another room and inspect them! -Yes, sir!

203
00:10:50,523 --> 00:10:52,423
Yes. Especially the three

204
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:54,623
who seem to have been on bad terms with the victim.

205
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,023
They should be checked as thoroughly as possible.

206
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:04,723
Nothing?

207
00:11:04,723 --> 00:11:06,323
Are you saying you couldn't find a container with poison in it

208
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:10,123
or a poison soaked handkerchief either?

209
00:11:10,123 --> 00:11:12,723
No. No one nor anywhere.

210
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:14,023
No way.

211
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:17,123
There was no chance for anyone to have disposed the poison.

212
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,623
Then, why doesn't anyone have the poison?

213
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:21,823
Besides, is there a way

214
00:11:21,823 --> 00:11:25,523
in which the poisoned plate can be given only to the victim?

215
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:27,723
How could the culprit make sure that no one would take the plate part way,

216
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:31,123
and set it up so that only the victim would pick it up?

217
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:43,586
Food writer?

218
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:47,286
Was Mr. Agatsuma, the victim a food writer?

219
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:51,986
Yes, he was a writer notorious for his harsh comments.

220
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:53,686
The shops that he says are delicious,

221
00:11:53,686 --> 00:11:55,886
are really reputed as being delicious.

222
00:11:55,886 --> 00:11:58,486
And he seems to have been taken very well by the readers.

223
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:01,086
On the other hand, the customers of the stores that he criticizes

224
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:02,586
decrease drastically,

225
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:06,386
and some cases the stores actually seem to have gone bankrupt.

226
00:12:06,386 --> 00:12:09,886
That could be the motive for the murder.

227
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:10,886
But the point is

228
00:12:10,886 --> 00:12:14,686
how did the killer make him take the plate smeared with poison?

229
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:16,286
Right.

230
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:18,886
By using this rotating sushi system,

231
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:20,886
it's possible to automatically bring the poisoned plate

232
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:23,386
in front of Mr. Agatsuma.

233
00:12:23,386 --> 00:12:27,086
But that doesn't mean he would pick it up 100%.

234
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:29,786
Well, there seems to have been many customers

235
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:32,086
seated in the lane where the victim was eating.

236
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:34,086
So, including the people who were in the kitchen,

237
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,786
we've got to check everyone thoroughly.

238
00:12:36,786 --> 00:12:38,886
Well, I think there were only three people

239
00:12:38,886 --> 00:12:40,686
who could've smeared poison on the plate.

240
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:42,686
-Three people? -Yes.

241
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:45,286
It seems that a little before, Mr. Agatsuma took the poisoned plate

242
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:46,786
and ate the sushi with his fingers,

243
00:12:46,786 --> 00:12:50,086
he had an argument with the shop manager.

244
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:53,386
That man shouted in a really loud voice and was making a racket!

245
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:55,486
It was really scary!

246
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:58,586
He was also taking his anger out on the other customers.

247
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:02,986
It seems that the customers sitting opposite him

248
00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:06,486
were all getting ready to leave because of what happened,

249
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,986
when Mr. Agatsuma collapsed.

250
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:10,786
The people sitting opposite him said

251
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:11,986
they didn't pick up any plates

252
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:14,786
from about 5 minutes before Mr. Agatsuma collapsed.

253
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:16,386
I see.

254
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:19,586
Several plates would go around in 5 minutes.

255
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:22,386
Which means that poison couldn't have been smeared on to a plate

256
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:25,686
that Mr. Agatsuma wouldn't pick up on the first round.

257
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:27,386
In other words, the suspicious people

258
00:13:27,386 --> 00:13:30,686
would be those who are in the kitchen and cannot be seen from here.

259
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,286
Rather, there were practically no plates left to pick up

260
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:35,286
because Mr. Agatsuma made a racket.

261
00:13:35,286 --> 00:13:36,586
However, the employees are saying that

262
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:40,486
they didn't place any newly made sushi on the lane in question.

263
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,186
In other words, the ones who could've

264
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:44,986
smeared poison on the plate after the racket are

265
00:13:44,986 --> 00:13:49,886
the man who sat to the left of the man who was killed

266
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:51,986
and the woman who was seated at the edge

267
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:56,386
on the right hand side of the man

268
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:59,386
with 6 people between them and the store manager

269
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:01,986
who was the first to run up to the man who collapsed.

270
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:05,286
That's right, isn't it, Officer Takagi?

271
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:06,686
Yeah.

272
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:09,486
But, why would the store manager who ran over be included too?

273
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:10,886
Well...

274
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:13,186
I did mention that the store manager had an argument with Mr. Agatsuma

275
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,386
before he collapsed, that's why.

276
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:19,386
They were arguing near Mr. Agatsuma's seat,

277
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:21,686
and it seems that they confronted each other at quite a close range,

278
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:23,986
-so I included him just in case. -Besides, the three...

279
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:27,786
seem to somehow have some connection with the man who was killed!

280
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,886
You got into a fight with Mr. Agatsuma before at this shop?

281
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:45,086
Yes. I was boasting to my wife

282
00:14:45,086 --> 00:14:48,886
that the flatfish here is cheap but delicious.

283
00:14:48,886 --> 00:14:52,886
Then, he suddenly butt in from the side.

284
00:14:52,886 --> 00:14:56,686
"That's not flatfish, it's sea bass, stupid."

285
00:14:58,186 --> 00:15:00,586
Was it sea bass?

286
00:15:00,586 --> 00:15:03,686
After taking a good taste at it again, yes, it was.

287
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:05,186
I see.

288
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:07,986
He embarrassed you in front of your wife.

289
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:09,586
That's not all!

290
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:12,086
I don't know how he found it,

291
00:15:12,086 --> 00:15:13,786
but he wrote his comment

292
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:17,286
in my gourmet walk around blog bulletin board.

293
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:18,986
He wrote, "This guy's got the tongue of a poor boy!

294
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,386
This blog is a bunch of baloney!"

295
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:25,886
But it's not that I held a grudge against him because of it.

296
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:29,686
But your seat was right next to Mr. Agatusma's.

297
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:32,486
You would've had many chances to poison his dish.

298
00:15:32,486 --> 00:15:35,586
Next to him yes, but I was to his left.

299
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:38,586
The sushi was going round from the right to the left.

300
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:41,286
So, I couldn't have smeared poison on the plate that he picked up!

301
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:45,286
Does it go from right to left?

302
00:15:45,286 --> 00:15:48,286
Yes, it spins clockwise.

303
00:15:48,286 --> 00:15:51,786
Although it stopped now after this boy told me to do so.

304
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:53,286
So, it means that

305
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,586
even if poison were to be smeared onto Mr. Agatsuma's plate,

306
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:57,486
the plate would have had to spin once around

307
00:15:57,486 --> 00:16:00,386
before passing in front of him.

308
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:03,086
Yes. And besides, that plate would be one

309
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:05,286
that Mr. Agatsuma let spin once around

310
00:16:05,286 --> 00:16:07,686
so it is highly likely that he wouldn't pick it up

311
00:16:07,686 --> 00:16:09,286
even if it came around again.

312
00:16:09,286 --> 00:16:13,186
But it would be a different story for the woman sitting to his right.

313
00:16:13,186 --> 00:16:14,586
Hey, hold it.

314
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:16,786
Even if I were to smear poison on the plate,

315
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:19,886
there's no guarantee that the good-for-nothing would pick the plate up!

316
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:21,386
Good-for-nothing?

317
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:25,686
You seem to be involved with Mr. Agatsuma in some way, too.

318
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:27,086
Yes! I sure do!

319
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,186
The Japanese cuisine shop that I ran went bankrupt

320
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:33,486
thanks to the article he wrote!

321
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:34,786
Went bankrupt?

322
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,086
Because of Mr. Agatsuma's article?

323
00:16:37,086 --> 00:16:38,186
Yes.

324
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:42,586
That man used to frequent my shop in the past,

325
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,386
but he wrote, "The taste of the shop suddenly went down,

326
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:47,686
and take-out sushi that comes in plastic containers taste better."

327
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:49,986
Is... Is that so?

328
00:16:49,986 --> 00:16:52,586
I couldn't help it!

329
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:55,386
Our sushi cook quit because of old age

330
00:16:55,386 --> 00:16:58,086
and the sushi cook said to be good, who supposed to take his place

331
00:16:58,086 --> 00:17:00,386
suddenly refused to take the position!

332
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:06,686
Don't tell me that the sushi cook is you, manager?

333
00:17:06,686 --> 00:17:09,286
Yes. My boss of the shop that I worked for previously

334
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:11,386
was acquainted with her

335
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:13,986
and he'd asked me to work for her, too.

336
00:17:13,986 --> 00:17:17,586
But just when I was about to go, I hurt my arm

337
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:22,686
and I refused because I wasn't able to make sushi like I used to.

338
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:24,986
How did you hurt your arm?

339
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:27,886
I tried to stop some customers from fighting

340
00:17:27,886 --> 00:17:31,086
and hurt my arm muscle.

341
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:33,986
And one of the customers was

342
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,286
that Mr. Agatsuma, you see.

343
00:17:41,286 --> 00:17:44,586
Well, that's why I gave up being a cook

344
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:46,986
but I couldn't forget the aroma of vinegar rice,

345
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:49,086
so I decided to work as manager here.

346
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:51,986
But I wouldn't do such a thing as smear poison on the plate.

347
00:17:51,986 --> 00:17:54,286
But you were right near him

348
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:57,286
when Mr. Agatsuma collapsed too, weren't you?

349
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,186
That's true,

350
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:01,686
but I didn't touch the plates that were rotating

351
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:04,786
and as the woman was saying

352
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:08,286
even if I were to be able to somehow smear poison on the plate,

353
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:11,586
how would I make him pick it up?

354
00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:13,086
Well...

355
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:16,186
Maybe it was his favorite dish?

356
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:19,586
He picked it up because it was a dish that he liked very much!

357
00:18:19,586 --> 00:18:22,186
-If it were Genta, it would be eels! -Yeah!

358
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,686
If it comes around, I wouldn't let it go pass me.

359
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,086
What kind of dish did Mr. Agatsuma like?

360
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:29,886
He didn't have anything he like in particular.

361
00:18:29,886 --> 00:18:33,786
Well, I guess even if he did have a favorite, it would be irrelevant.

362
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:37,486
That is, even if it were to be the victim's favorite,

363
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:38,986
whether he would pick up his favourite or not

364
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:41,186
would depend on how he feels at that time.

365
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:45,586
There's no way of knowing 100% what sushi he would pick up.

366
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:48,986
Of course anyone could've picked up the poisoned plate.

367
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:51,186
It would be a different story, though,

368
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:54,086
if this were indiscriminate murder.

369
00:18:54,086 --> 00:18:55,486
True.

370
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:58,186
But I wonder? Is there a way

371
00:18:58,186 --> 00:19:02,086
to make only Mr. Agatsuma pick up the poisoned plate?

372
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:05,786
That's right, he could order it!

373
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:07,286
If he placed the order for the sushi,

374
00:19:07,286 --> 00:19:09,486
he would pick it up for sure!

375
00:19:09,486 --> 00:19:11,786
-Place an order? -Yes.

376
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:13,886
If you place an order using this touch panel,

377
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:17,186
the sushi comes in a bowl with the sign "ordered" on it,

378
00:19:17,186 --> 00:19:20,786
and when it comes in front of you, there is beeping sound.

379
00:19:21,686 --> 00:19:22,986
I see!

380
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:24,686
So, Ms. Takemura who was seated to the right of the victim

381
00:19:24,686 --> 00:19:26,686
could've done it!

382
00:19:26,686 --> 00:19:28,586
No way.

383
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:31,686
Even if an ordered plate were to come around,

384
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:33,586
I couldn't have smeared poison on it!

385
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:37,086
Because beyond him, there was a man who was wearing a cap,

386
00:19:37,086 --> 00:19:39,386
I had no way of knowing which one of them had placed the order!

387
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:44,086
Besides, I can't even see the touch panel from my seat,

388
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:47,586
so I wasn't able to tell what he ordered.

389
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,486
The only one who could see it

390
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:53,386
was Mr. Aizono who was sitting next to him.

391
00:19:53,386 --> 00:19:55,786
Hey, hold it, will you?

392
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:57,386
I mentioned it a while ago too,

393
00:19:57,386 --> 00:19:59,886
but I was sitting to the left of Mr. Agatsuma,

394
00:19:59,886 --> 00:20:03,386
and the sushi was rotating from right to left!

395
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:04,786
Even if I were to be able to see

396
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,986
what Mr. Agatsuma ordered using the touch panel,

397
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:12,186
the plate would be picked up by him before it reaches me!

398
00:20:12,186 --> 00:20:13,586
True.

399
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:18,086
Besides, I'm not the only one who can see the touch panel.

400
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:20,486
The manager can too!

401
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,086
Because after arguing with Mr. Agatsuma

402
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:24,086
and up to the time Mr. Agatsuma collapsed,

403
00:20:24,086 --> 00:20:26,186
he was standing behind him!

404
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:29,786
-Is that true? -Yes.

405
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:32,686
Since Mr. Agatsuma was making such a racket,

406
00:20:32,686 --> 00:20:35,886
I told him, "You don't have to pay, so please leave."

407
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:38,686
Then he said, "If it's free, I'll eat and leave."

408
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:40,686
So, I stood behind him

409
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:43,086
to watch that he wouldn't make further trouble.

410
00:20:44,886 --> 00:20:46,686
Well, but as far as I saw,

411
00:20:46,686 --> 00:20:49,586
he didn't seem to have been ordering anything.

412
00:20:49,586 --> 00:20:53,786
We can tell for sure if I check the computer though.

413
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,086
-Check it. -Yes, sir.

414
00:20:58,886 --> 00:21:00,986
Officer.

415
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:03,186
Haven't you forgotten?

416
00:21:03,186 --> 00:21:05,786
You did a body check on us a while ago,

417
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,286
but no container with poison inside,

418
00:21:07,286 --> 00:21:10,786
nor any handkerchief soaked with poison was found!

419
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:14,686
Despite of this, I question why you keep on suspecting us.

420
00:21:14,686 --> 00:21:15,986
I'm sure that the killer

421
00:21:15,986 --> 00:21:18,986
was among the customers that already left the shop.

422
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,186
Maybe that's why the container with poison inside wasn't found.

423
00:21:22,186 --> 00:21:25,686
Which means unless we capture that killer,

424
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:30,986
we'll never find out how just Mr. Agatsuma was targeted.

425
00:21:30,986 --> 00:21:35,386
No. I'm pretty sure that the killer is among the three here.

426
00:21:35,386 --> 00:21:40,386
First, Mr. Osamu Aizono who was seated left of Mr. Agatsuma.

427
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:41,686
Mr. Aizono would be able to tell

428
00:21:41,686 --> 00:21:46,186
what kind of sushi Mr. Agatsuma ordered using the touch panel

429
00:21:46,186 --> 00:21:50,286
but since the sushi goes round from right to left,

430
00:21:50,286 --> 00:21:51,886
Mr. Agatsuma would pick up the plate

431
00:21:51,886 --> 00:21:54,786
before the poison is smeared onto the plate.

432
00:21:54,786 --> 00:21:56,486
If it were Ms. Sakiko Takemura

433
00:21:56,486 --> 00:21:58,986
who was seated to the right of Mr. Agatsuma, with us in between...

434
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:00,786
She would've been able to smear poison on the plate

435
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,286
before he picked it up,

436
00:22:03,286 --> 00:22:06,486
but she couldn't see the touch panel from where she was seated.

437
00:22:07,686 --> 00:22:11,586
Mr. Danji Namiki who was standing behind Mr. Agatsuma

438
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:13,986
could also have watched the touch panel.

439
00:22:13,986 --> 00:22:18,686
But Mr. Namiki didn't move from behind Mr. Agatsuma,

440
00:22:18,686 --> 00:22:21,286
so he couldn't touch the sushi plates.

441
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:24,786
Who on earth is the killer?

442
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:28,086
And how did the killer

443
00:22:28,086 --> 00:22:32,486
target only Mr. Agatsuma with the poisoned plate?

444
00:23:57,386 --> 00:23:59,486
"Next Episode" -I think the man

445
00:23:59,486 --> 00:24:01,386
who died was left-handed!

446
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:05,186
If poison were to be smeared on to the left side of the plate,

447
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:08,286
it would possible to make only him touch the poison.

448
00:24:09,286 --> 00:24:12,586
There's something by the tea cup.

449
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,686
Oh, that sushi...

450
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,886
I wonder if it's okay to eat it?

451
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:18,586
I see.

452
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:19,886
So, it's a trick that could've been carried out

453
00:24:19,886 --> 00:24:21,786
only because sushi was used!

454
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:27,886
Next Conan, "Rotating Sushi Mystery (Part 2)"

455
00:24:42,004 --> 00:24:44,104
Next Conan's Hint:

"The method of eating sushi."

457
00:24:46,404 --> 00:24:47,704
First, order eels.

458
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:48,704
Next, order a bowl of eels over rice.

459
