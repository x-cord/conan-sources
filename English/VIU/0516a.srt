1
00:00:04,727 --> 00:00:07,327
"Torada Residence"

2
00:00:08,027 --> 00:00:09,927
He's been hit all over his body

3
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,127
and died of massive bleeding.

4
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:13,527
He fell to his death?

5
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:14,927
Yes.

6
00:00:14,927 --> 00:00:18,527
My son Yoshiro, the sole heir to my estate

7
00:00:18,527 --> 00:00:20,727
was killed by the hands of a ruthless devil

8
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:23,727
who holds a grudge against we, the Torada family.

9
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:27,727
You mean, somebody pushed him off a high place?

10
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,827
No, it was a tornado.

11
00:00:29,827 --> 00:00:31,027
What?

12
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:32,927
He got caught in a tornado,

13
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:34,827
was sucked up into mid-air

14
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:38,127
and thrown down to his death on a rocky area.

15
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:40,227
Tornado...

16
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:43,327
which means, he wasn't murdered?

17
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:46,627
Look closely, Mr. Mouri.

18
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:50,127
Don't you see something in that pool of blood?

19
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:54,527
I'm sure you can see it if you look very closely.

20
00:00:54,527 --> 00:00:57,727
You'll see something that shouldn't be there.

21
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:02,427
Centipede!

22
00:01:02,427 --> 00:01:06,627
The corpse of that centipede appears to have stepped on once,

23
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:10,227
and placed there before the blood dried.

24
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:13,327
In other words, that someone...

25
00:01:15,027 --> 00:01:19,027
despite seeing our son in that condition,

26
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:22,627
didn't call for help,

27
00:01:22,627 --> 00:01:25,727
but instead put that repulsive insect next to him

28
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:28,127
and left him to die.

29
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:30,227
But, it could be that

30
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:32,227
the corpse of a centipede that someone stepped on,

31
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:35,027
coincidentally flew there hurled by wind of the tornado...

32
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:38,727
Shigetsugu who found the dead body said that,

33
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:41,727
"there are no centipedes in area."

34
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,227
He also went on to say that his older brother was left to die.

35
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:45,227
Older brother?

36
00:01:45,227 --> 00:01:49,227
Didn't you say earlier that the deceased was your sole heir?

37
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,427
I don't consider a moron who wastes his time hunting

38
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:57,127
for non-existent treasure, my son anymore!

39
00:01:57,127 --> 00:02:00,727
And? You have an idea of who the culprit is, don't you?

40
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:02,727
I mean you mentioned being hated too!

41
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:04,327
Conan!

42
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:06,227
Yes. The ones who have been feuding with us

43
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,527
the Torada family for years.

44
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:11,827
The Tatsuo family.

45
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:14,227
I'm sure that the fiend who left our son to die

46
00:02:14,227 --> 00:02:16,627
is among them.

47
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:30,327
The start of the age of mystery.

48
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:32,227
The detective show on Monday at 7.

49
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:34,427
Shingen's treasures. The mystery of "Fuurinkazan".

50
00:02:34,427 --> 00:02:36,427
The screams of Ran and Kazuha rip through the air.

51
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:37,927
He sees through the one and only truth.

52
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:39,727
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

53
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:42,327
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

54
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,200
"Fuurinkazan: The Mysterious Armored Warrior"

55
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,900
"Tatsuo Residence" -Your son Koji

56
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,800
was tied up, buried,

57
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:33,401
struck repeatedly with a blunt object and beaten to death.

58
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:36,201
On top of that, before his blood even dried up

59
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:39,701
the culprit left the corpse of a centipede next to him and fled.

60
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:42,701
Talk about cruel.

61
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:46,101
And? What did the police say?

62
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:49,901
Well, they just keep repeating the same answer, saying:

63
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:52,301
"We're investigating, we're investigating."

64
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:55,401
That's why I called you, Hattori.

65
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:56,401
I got my old friend

66
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:59,101
Ohtaki from the Osaka police department to contact you.

67
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:01,401
But, Mr. Ohtaki said that

68
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,801
you already have an idea of who the culprit is.

69
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:06,901
Well, it's more like...

70
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:09,501
It's revenge.

71
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:12,001
Thinking that we, the Tatsuo family

72
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:14,501
was to blame for the death of their son,

73
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:17,901
someone in the Torada family

74
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,801
killed Koji in retaliation.

75
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:24,001
Mother! We don't know for sure yet.

76
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:26,401
No doubt, seeing from how hideous and ruthless the murder was,

77
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:29,001
that it was one of them that did it!

78
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:32,301
And? Who found the corpse?

79
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:36,001
Oh, my other son, Akira.

80
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,601
He said he found it on his way back home

81
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:39,401
from horseback archery practice.

82
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:40,801
Horseback archery is the sport

83
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:43,501
where you fire an arrow while riding a horse, isn't it?

84
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:47,101
Yeah. Akira is a top practitioner of it in our village,

85
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:50,401
and always displays his skills during festivals.

86
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:53,801
And where is Akira now?

87
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:09,701
Got them all. Just as expected of you, Akira!

88
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:13,901
Yeah, I guess I'll get to be the horseback archery bowman

89
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:15,901
for the next festival too.

90
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:18,001
If so, you'll have been one for six consecutive years.

91
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:22,001
They should just declare you be the horseback archery bowman already!

92
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:26,701
No, I haven't reached my senior's level yet.

93
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:30,001
Are you Akira?

94
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,201
Oh, yes.

95
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:36,101
I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri from Tokyo.

96
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:37,501
If it's okay with you,

97
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:40,401
I'd like to ask you about the situation

98
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,601
when you found Koji's body.

99
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:45,701
I guess. I don't mind.

100
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:48,101
Do you have any reason to find it difficult to answer?

101
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:50,201
Oh, no, it's just that someone asked me

102
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,401
the exact same question a while ago.

103
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:54,701
A boy detective with an Osaka accent.

104
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:56,901
Osaka accent?

105
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:59,801
A boy detective?

106
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:01,001
Don't tell me that...

107
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:05,901
Yeah, I'm the one who found my older brother Yoshiro's body.

108
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:09,701
It's true that there was the corpse of a centipede next to the body.

109
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:11,801
But, why a centipede?

110
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:13,101
Beats me...

111
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:16,301
Does either the Torada family or the Tatsuo family

112
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:20,401
have any karmic connection or something with centipedes?

113
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:22,401
I don't know of any karmic connection.

114
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:26,101
But, I have a feeling I've seen pictures of centipedes at the festival.

115
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:27,401
Festival?

116
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:29,801
At the festival where the horseback archery is held,

117
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:33,301
the men of the village have a mock battle.

118
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:35,301
They wear the armor over there.

119
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:37,201
Although it's called an armor,

120
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:39,801
it's just a fairly lightweight plastic protector

121
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:42,401
provided by the village.

122
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:43,501
I have a feeling

123
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:47,801
I saw a picture of the centipede somewhere at the festival.

124
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:51,101
Where? Did you see a drawing of it on a chest protector or something?

125
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:53,201
I know that one of the warlords of the Sengoku Period

126
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:56,101
had a drawing of a dragonfly on his helmet.

127
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,801
Speaking of warlords,

128
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:02,001
there was a detective who came by and asked the same question.

129
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:03,001
A detective?

130
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:05,801
Yeah. A detective from Tokyo.

131
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:08,901
His last name was the same as one of the warlords.

132
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:10,701
Could it have been Mouri?

133
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:13,301
Right! Like in Motonari Mouri!

134
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:15,501
It's Ran's dad!

135
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:18,701
Was there a little kid wearing glasses with them too?

136
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:20,101
Yeah.

137
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:24,101
He was asking about the incident more diligently than the detective.

138
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:25,501
It's Kudo!

139
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:27,301
That reminds me. Akira told us that

140
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:31,501
a person died in a strange accident that happened six years ago.

141
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:33,101
Is that true?

142
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:36,501
Yeah. The deceased was the one selected to be our

143
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:39,001
horseback riding archery bowman for the festival, until the previous year,

144
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:41,201
Mr. Kuroto Kai.

145
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:44,801
I heard he fell off a cliff while practicing...

146
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:47,401
Who would know more about this in detail?

147
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,201
Maybe Yui, my late brother's wife.

148
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:52,901
After all, she's the one who found his body.

149
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,701
Where is she now?

150
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,501
You see those stables behind the fence?

151
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:02,501
I'm sure she's taking care of the horses now.

152
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:07,001
It's Kudo!

153
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:10,201
Kudo was also lured over and came here, smelling out the case!

154
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:15,701
It's just as I thought! We're two of a kind, birds of a feather!

155
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:19,901
Hey, come on, give me a break!

156
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:22,201
I'm still trying to get over the death of my husband, you know!

157
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:24,801
-I'm in no mood... -Oh, listen to him going at it!

158
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:26,701
Please leave already!

159
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:30,701
Hey! Why don't you cut it out already?

160
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:36,201
What is it, kid?

161
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,201
Well...

162
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:40,701
Have you seen a detective

163
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:44,601
with swept back hair, a flimsy mustache and a dopey look?

164
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:48,701
Swept back hair, a flimsy mustache and a dopey look.

165
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:51,801
You mean like this?

166
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:55,801
No, not at all...

167
00:09:56,601 --> 00:09:59,301
Kazuha, Hattori, long time no see!

168
00:09:59,301 --> 00:10:01,701
Ran! How've you been?

169
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,301
Great!

170
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:08,801
So it's him after all.

171
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:13,001
And, who's that grouchy looking man?

172
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:15,801
Beats me.

173
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:20,201
I'm Kansuke Yamato of the Nagano Prefectural Police Department,

174
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:23,101
the one in charge of this case!

175
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:25,201
A police detective?

176
00:10:26,201 --> 00:10:29,501
I was just asking her some questions.

177
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:34,501
Okay, ma'am. I'll ask you once more.

178
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:38,901
Was it there six years ago or was it not?

179
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:42,401
I just said, I'm in no mood to answer.

180
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:45,001
People's lives are at stake!

181
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:47,601
Stop blabbering and answer me!

182
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:52,301
There wasn't.

183
00:10:57,001 --> 00:11:00,801
There was no centipede near the corpse.

184
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:04,101
The only thing there was a thin corpse on the ground

185
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:06,601
along with a dead horse.

186
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:09,001
I see.

187
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:12,701
I'm sorry to have intruded on you.

188
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:16,401
Hey, hold it.

189
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:19,901
What's with the centipede?

190
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:22,301
I don't know for sure yet but...

191
00:11:22,301 --> 00:11:25,601
if we don't figure this case out right away,

192
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:32,201
we're going to be seeing a lot of corpses rolling on the ground

193
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:37,001
just like on the battlefields of the Warring Period.

194
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,737
As to what these two successive cases

195
00:11:47,737 --> 00:11:49,437
share in common,

196
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:50,537
the people who found the dead bodies

197
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:52,437
were both related to the victims.

198
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:53,637
And, for some unknown reason,

199
00:11:53,637 --> 00:11:58,237
a dead centipede was found nearby.

200
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:02,337
The thing that bothers me is the incident six years ago,

201
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:04,337
when Mr. Kuroto Kai during horseback archery practice

202
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:09,537
fell over a cliff along with his horse and passed away.

203
00:12:09,537 --> 00:12:11,737
But, I'd say, it was just an accident

204
00:12:11,737 --> 00:12:14,737
and most likely has nothing to do with these two cases.

205
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:20,437
Yeah. That is, if we believe what Ms. Yui Torada said

206
00:12:20,437 --> 00:12:23,537
about no centipedes being found near the bodies.

207
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:25,337
There wasn't any.

208
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:28,037
Although no centipedes were placed by the bodies,

209
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:30,737
the fact that the victims were left to die,

210
00:12:30,737 --> 00:12:34,137
resembles the first case, in which my husband died.

211
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:35,637
He was left to die?

212
00:12:35,637 --> 00:12:38,037
Didn't he die instantly after falling over the cliff?

213
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,437
I told you, didn't I?

214
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:43,137
That the corpse was emaciated.

215
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,637
It's true that when he fell off the cliff,

216
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:47,337
he sustained serious injuries when his body slammed against

217
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:49,137
the trees and the rocks.

218
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:51,437
His outfit was also smeared all over with blood,

219
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,337
and oxidation caused it to turn totally black.

220
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:56,837
-But, he died of starvation. -Starvation?

221
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:58,437
Yes.

222
00:12:58,437 --> 00:13:01,437
In addition to not being able to stand because he broke his hip bone,

223
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:04,537
he fell in a place where sunlight didn't shine at all.

224
00:13:04,537 --> 00:13:07,437
Besides, he fell right below the cliff where people rarely pass by.

225
00:13:07,437 --> 00:13:11,337
He was found almost a week after his fall.

226
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:13,137
A week later?

227
00:13:13,137 --> 00:13:18,237
No one found him despite the horse falling over with him too?

228
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:20,737
Did you really search for him?

229
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:23,037
Of course! The police as well as all the villagers

230
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:25,437
searched for him staying up till late!

231
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,837
After all, Officer Kai was loved by all the villagers!

232
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:30,137
Officer?

233
00:13:30,137 --> 00:13:31,637
You mean he was a police officer?

234
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:35,137
Yes. He worked at the village police box.

235
00:13:35,137 --> 00:13:38,537
He had a strong sense of justice, was kind and gentle.

236
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:42,537
I never heard of anyone in the village speak ill of him.

237
00:13:42,537 --> 00:13:46,237
That's why we all searched frantically for him when he disappeared.

238
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:50,237
Then why couldn't he be found for an entire week?

239
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:52,537
-The leaves. -Leaves?

240
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:55,237
He was unfortunately buried under the fallen leaves,

241
00:13:55,237 --> 00:13:59,037
and hidden beneath until the wind blew them away.

242
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:01,637
My brother Yoshiro's body was easily found

243
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:05,137
because it had fallen on a rocky area in clear view.

244
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:08,237
Did all the villagers look for him back then too?

245
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:11,537
No, we started looking for him only after we found out

246
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:14,037
he didn't come back despite daybreak.

247
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:16,237
Started looking for him?

248
00:14:16,237 --> 00:14:18,837
Didn't you find my husband coincidentally

249
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,537
when you were headed for that hole?

250
00:14:20,537 --> 00:14:23,437
Oh, maybe you're right.

251
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:25,037
"That hole?"

252
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:27,037
It's just a hobby.

253
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:29,537
I sort of treasure hunter, you see.

254
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:31,537
Hobby my foot!

255
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,037
As if not working isn't enough,

256
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:35,337
getting carried away with something like that.

257
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:37,637
You're a shame to the Torada family!

258
00:14:37,637 --> 00:14:40,337
Shape up, Shigetsugu.

259
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,937
After all, you're the only heir left as of now.

260
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:45,837
Yeah.

261
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:49,137
And? Did you come up with anything, Mr. Mouri?

262
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:53,437
No, only that the corpse of a centipede was found near

263
00:14:53,437 --> 00:14:58,437
the deceased body of Koji Tatsuo and Yoshiro as well.

264
00:14:58,437 --> 00:15:00,237
Come to think of it,

265
00:15:00,237 --> 00:15:03,537
Koji used to have a lot of private talks with my husband before he died.

266
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:04,837
Private talks?

267
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:08,437
Something about "going" or "not going."

268
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:12,137
Yeah. I heard him say that too.

269
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:14,937
He said that they would be going together see

270
00:15:14,937 --> 00:15:17,637
that one-eyed detective called Yamato soon.

271
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:19,537
And that it may turn into something terrible,

272
00:15:19,537 --> 00:15:21,637
so to be prepared for it.

273
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:22,637
What?

274
00:15:22,637 --> 00:15:25,237
Did you hear what they were going to meet him for?

275
00:15:25,237 --> 00:15:29,437
No. Only that he couldn't talk about it yet.

276
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:31,937
Maybe we'll be able to find something

277
00:15:31,937 --> 00:15:33,737
if we go over to the Tatsuo residence then.

278
00:15:33,737 --> 00:15:36,837
Yeah, let's strike while the iron's hot!

279
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:39,237
Okay, we're heading over there,

280
00:15:39,237 --> 00:15:41,537
so you stay here at the house with her, Kazuha!

281
00:15:41,537 --> 00:15:44,337
-What? -Take us with you too!

282
00:15:44,337 --> 00:15:48,537
Don't be silly, you'll only get in our way!

283
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,537
They were planning to go to the police?

284
00:15:56,537 --> 00:15:59,837
You mean my son Koji and Yoshiro Torada?

285
00:15:59,837 --> 00:16:03,837
Yes, haven't you heard anything about it from your son?

286
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,737
No, nothing at all.

287
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:08,537
Only after Yoshiro passed away,

288
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:12,537
he seemed to be terrified of something.

289
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:13,937
He seemed terrified?

290
00:16:13,937 --> 00:16:18,737
Right, he used to mumble even during meals,

291
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:23,537
saying, it could be his turn next. That he'd be killed.

292
00:16:23,537 --> 00:16:26,037
Cursed to death.

293
00:16:26,037 --> 00:16:28,937
-Cursed? -Don't you understand?

294
00:16:28,937 --> 00:16:30,937
The curse of the Torada family

295
00:16:30,937 --> 00:16:34,137
that has been hating the Tatuso family for generations!

296
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:40,737
How come this family and that family don't get along?

297
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:44,437
That's because...

298
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,937
long, long ago...

299
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:52,737
It seems to have slipped my mind.

300
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:54,937
-Come on... -Granny.

301
00:16:54,937 --> 00:16:57,437
I was told that the Torada family was hateful

302
00:16:57,437 --> 00:17:00,137
since I was a little child.

303
00:17:00,137 --> 00:17:02,437
But, I've forgotten why.

304
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:06,637
I'm sure the feeling is mutual with the Torada family too.

305
00:17:06,637 --> 00:17:08,937
Now that the knotted chains have loosened up,

306
00:17:08,937 --> 00:17:10,337
both Ayaka and I

307
00:17:10,337 --> 00:17:12,237
were on good terms

308
00:17:12,237 --> 00:17:14,037
with Yoshiro and Shigetsugu Torada.

309
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:16,337
But then those two had been talking about

310
00:17:16,337 --> 00:17:18,937
going to the police before they died.

311
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,437
I bet it had to do with the accident

312
00:17:20,437 --> 00:17:22,737
involving the police officer called Kai.

313
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:25,037
That was just an accident.

314
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:27,237
He worked too hard on horseback archery practice,

315
00:17:27,237 --> 00:17:30,037
he fell off the cliff from exhaustion.

316
00:17:30,037 --> 00:17:31,737
He was too uptight over

317
00:17:31,737 --> 00:17:34,637
missing the target at the tournament that year.

318
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,837
Now, stop that! Ayaka!

319
00:17:36,837 --> 00:17:38,737
But that's what everybody says!

320
00:17:38,737 --> 00:17:41,437
They even say that he might have jumped off the cliff

321
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:42,937
from the shock.

322
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,237
There are times when the archer misses the mark?

323
00:17:45,237 --> 00:17:47,037
Yes, once in while.

324
00:17:47,037 --> 00:17:51,037
But Mr. Kai never missed.

325
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:55,237
Until that last shot of the tournament that year.

326
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:58,837
He would never think of committing suicide.

327
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:01,337
He would leave the people of the village

328
00:18:01,337 --> 00:18:05,937
just because of some embarrassment at a tournament.

329
00:18:05,937 --> 00:18:09,437
He isn't such a coward.

330
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:15,637
Huh? You're staying over there?

331
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,737
You're not planning to come back here, Heiji?

332
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:20,937
Well, it's starting to rain hard.

333
00:18:20,937 --> 00:18:23,837
And, they way it's really dangerous walking in the woods at night.

334
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,337
So, it's how it is.

335
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:28,437
Sleep tight, and don't let the bed bugs bite!

336
00:18:28,437 --> 00:18:30,237
Hey! Heiji!

337
00:18:31,837 --> 00:18:33,837
He hang up.

338
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:36,837
So, Kudo! Anything you noticed?

339
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:39,437
Nothing yet.

340
00:18:39,437 --> 00:18:41,437
The one thing that bugs me

341
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:46,037
is what Koji had been muttering before he died.

342
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:48,737
That he might be next.

343
00:18:50,237 --> 00:18:53,637
If that's true, this is a serial murder case!

344
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:58,237
On top of that, there may be more to come!

345
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:08,037
Hey, Ran. Ran!

346
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:11,337
Did you hear that?

347
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:13,137
Huh?

348
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:16,237
I only hear the rain and the thunder.

349
00:19:16,237 --> 00:19:19,437
Hey, that one! I hear something else.

350
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:21,637
Like the floor creaking.

351
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:04,587
It's true! It's for real!

352
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:06,686
We really did see it, didn't we, Ran?

353
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:10,286
Yeah! We weren't imagining it!

354
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:12,886
Well, but...

355
00:20:12,886 --> 00:20:14,986
What are you doing here, Kazuha?

356
00:20:14,986 --> 00:20:17,686
Heiji. I saw something.

357
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:18,786
Seen what?

358
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:22,286
Last night, when a lightning flashed...

359
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:24,986
It was standing right behind the screen door!

360
00:20:24,986 --> 00:20:27,786
The armored...

361
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:29,586
Wandering warrior!

362
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:31,286
A wandering warrior?

363
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:34,186
You mean the suit of armor we saw in Shigetsugu's room

364
00:20:34,186 --> 00:20:36,786
the one they use in the festival?

365
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:41,486
No! The one we saw had some fluffy hair on the helment.

366
00:20:41,486 --> 00:20:45,386
That's the legendary Suwa Hossyo helmet of Shingen Takeda!

367
00:20:45,386 --> 00:20:47,386
Takeda...

368
00:20:47,386 --> 00:20:50,186
you mean the Red Armor of Takeda?

369
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:53,986
Was the armor red?

370
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:59,286
Well... what we saw as a silhouette.

371
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:07,586
No!

372
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:11,386
Ayaka locked herself up in the toilet?

373
00:21:11,386 --> 00:21:14,286
Right after you were talking about Shingen Takeda's armor?

374
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:18,186
-Hey, Ayaka! What happened? -Come out! Don't make such a ruckus!

375
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:20,986
Ayaka! Ayaka!

376
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:25,286
What is going on?

377
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:28,386
She's not here? My daughter-in-law!

378
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:32,186
I wonder. She was right here a while ago.

379
00:21:32,186 --> 00:21:33,786
She asked me to be left alone,

380
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:36,486
so I left for a while.

381
00:21:36,486 --> 00:21:38,786
She must still be nearby!

382
00:21:38,786 --> 00:21:40,886
We need to split up and find her!

383
00:21:40,886 --> 00:21:43,086
Then I'll use my scooter.

384
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:44,686
I'll take the car!

385
00:21:44,686 --> 00:21:47,986
Akira, Yui and I will take the horses!

386
00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:50,486
The rest on foot!

387
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:51,886
Ayaka!

388
00:21:51,886 --> 00:21:54,186
Where are you?

389
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:56,286
Ayaka!

390
00:21:56,286 --> 00:21:57,586
Where are you?

391
00:21:57,586 --> 00:22:00,786
Ayaka! Ayaka!

392
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,686
Answer!

393
00:22:02,686 --> 00:22:05,886
-Ayaka! -Ayaka!

394
00:22:05,886 --> 00:22:09,086
Where are you?

395
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:11,686
When I got here...

396
00:22:16,686 --> 00:22:19,086
There she was, like that.

397
00:22:19,086 --> 00:22:21,286
Conan, you shouldn't be...

398
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:27,686
What's going on?

399
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:29,486
What is it?

400
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:32,586
Ayaka, Ayaka is...

401
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:35,286
Ayaka! Ayaka!

402
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:37,986
Don't move!

403
00:22:37,986 --> 00:22:40,886
The area is now under police control!

404
00:22:40,886 --> 00:22:44,086
Anyone trying to get inside will be prosecuted by me!

405
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:46,386
What the...

406
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:50,686
Hey! You on the black horse.

407
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:51,986
Keep off, you hear!

408
00:22:51,986 --> 00:22:53,886
Yes.

409
00:22:57,686 --> 00:23:00,586
What the...

410
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:02,686
What happened?

411
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,886
Darn! Didn't make it!

412
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:14,286
Uehara, confirm the time!

413
00:23:14,286 --> 00:23:15,686
Yes, sir.

414
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,586
8:59 am.

415
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:22,186
Sorry, old habit.

416
00:23:23,686 --> 00:23:24,686
No problem.

417
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:25,686
Old?

418
00:23:25,686 --> 00:23:27,286
Habit?

419
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:28,486
It's me!

420
00:23:28,486 --> 00:23:30,786
A death in the forest near the Toradas.

421
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:33,586
Send the forensic people right away!

422
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:36,886
Yeah, right! This is serial murder!

423
00:23:36,886 --> 00:23:39,886
Serial murder?

424
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:41,086
No doubt!

425
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,086
The first death of Yoshiro Torada,

426
00:23:43,086 --> 00:23:48,386
left to die after being maimed in a tornado.

427
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:52,786
The second case of Koji Tatsuo beaten to death

428
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:55,586
and buried in a mound.

429
00:23:55,586 --> 00:23:59,186
Just like in the two earlier cases,

430
00:23:59,186 --> 00:24:02,586
there it was, at the foot of Ayaka Tatsuo's body,

431
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:05,386
a dead centipede!

432
00:24:05,386 --> 00:24:07,386
What?

433
00:24:07,386 --> 00:24:08,786
On top of that,

434
00:24:08,786 --> 00:24:13,586
the ground around the centipede was wet with rain

435
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:18,786
and shows no trace except my own footprints and cane prints!

436
00:24:18,786 --> 00:24:21,286
After the rain,

437
00:24:21,286 --> 00:24:27,286
no one seems to have been up this tree

438
00:24:27,286 --> 00:24:30,386
which means...

439
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,486
It's impossible...

440
00:24:32,486 --> 00:24:35,986
Impossible murder.
