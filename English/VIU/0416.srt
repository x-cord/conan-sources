1
00:00:00,586 --> 00:00:02,285
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:02,286 --> 00:00:03,985
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:03,986 --> 00:00:05,685
The mystery deepens with the second incident.

4
00:00:05,686 --> 00:00:07,285
It is the existence of something that's not supposed to.

5
00:00:07,286 --> 00:00:09,185
This gives the evil spirit racket a boost!

6
00:00:09,186 --> 00:00:10,685
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:12,585
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:14,786
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:58,605
We were invited to a wealthy person's residence in Shizuoka prefecture.

10
00:01:58,606 --> 00:02:00,305
But the request of the client was a difficult one,

11
00:02:00,306 --> 00:02:04,606
asking to scientifically explain the curse of an evil spirit.

12
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:07,205
At the house,

13
00:02:07,206 --> 00:02:08,505
for the past few years,

14
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:12,206
they say on Butsumetsu the 4th, something bad always occurs.

15
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:15,805
And on Butsumetsu of October 4th,

16
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:17,506
the misfortune befalls the first victim.

17
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:25,605
The victim is Mr. Toshimichi Sekiguchi, age 43.

18
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:29,505
Well, we can't tell whether it's suicide or homicide yet, but...

19
00:02:29,506 --> 00:02:33,405
This card that reads, "I atone my sins of 13 years ago"

20
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:36,605
is sure to be the key to solving the case.

21
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:38,806
It was just about 13 years ago.

22
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:45,505
The master's cruiser had a marine accident.

23
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:48,405
Is there anybody here that is the bereaved family of a victim

24
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:50,305
of that accident and working here?

25
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:51,406
Yes.

26
00:02:55,206 --> 00:03:00,906
"The Evil Spirit that Appears on Butsumetsu (Suspicion)"

27
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,405
Will each of you introduce yourselves

28
00:03:04,406 --> 00:03:08,705
and tell me of the person that died in the accident 13 years ago?

29
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:11,405
Let's see...

30
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:14,005
Then, why don't we start with Shigeko?

31
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:15,205
Yes.

32
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:19,005
I'm Shigeko Senzaki, the housekeeper.

33
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:23,005
I lost my husband who used to work here as a chef in the accident.

34
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:26,205
He was in charge of preparing the meals during the cruise.

35
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:31,705
My daughter and I were also scheduled to go on the cruise,

36
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:34,106
but we were both in bed with a cold.

37
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:39,405
After father died, I succeeded him and work here as a chef.

38
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:43,005
I also have succeeded my father and work here as a chauffeur.

39
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:44,805
I'm Masashi Watabiki.

40
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:48,805
I lost my father and younger brother in the accident.

41
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:50,605
You lost both members of your family?

42
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,605
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:56,605
My father was in charge of sailing the ship, so he had no choice.

44
00:03:56,606 --> 00:03:59,805
But my younger brother just happened to go along.

45
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,205
It's truly regrettable.

46
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:08,305
The last victim was my wife who used to work as a housekeeper here.

47
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:14,005
She was a great wife who used to help me out with my job as a steward, too.

48
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:19,105
Who would've thought that she would end up like that?

49
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:20,805
Akatsuka...

50
00:04:20,806 --> 00:04:22,905
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

51
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:25,805
Forcing us to tell you what we don't want to recall!

52
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:30,805
Well, you see, I figured that maybe the one who killed Mr. Sekiguchi

53
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:33,205
could be among you guys.

54
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,705
After all, it's strange.

55
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:38,805
Even after seeing the card, "I am the fifth soul",

56
00:04:38,806 --> 00:04:43,406
none of you mentioned anything about the marine accident 13 years ago.

57
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:46,705
Could it be that you already know who the killer is,

58
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:49,705
but not telling us and protecting the killer?

59
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,405
No way!

60
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:54,205
After all, four people died in the accident, you know!

61
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:56,606
There aren't five souls!

62
00:04:57,606 --> 00:05:01,605
One, two, three, four...

63
00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:03,605
That's true.

64
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:07,005
In the first place, the accident occurred on September 29th

65
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,105
on Taian (lucky day) 13 years ago.

66
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:11,705
It wasn't on the 4th, nor was it on Butsumetsu!

67
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:13,605
Oh, I see.

68
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:19,705
Besides, I don't think the chef and housekeeper could've done it.

69
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:21,805
Because... Look!

70
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:25,105
Mr. Sekiguchi was found hanging on the veranda.

71
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:26,205
I see!

72
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:29,605
Namika who has aerophobia can't go near it.

73
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:34,005
That's true, but what about Shigeko?

74
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:37,705
The killer hung Mr. Sekiguchi to make it look like suicide, right?

75
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:41,405
If so, the killer would look below before doing so, right?

76
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:43,705
In order to make sure that nobody is watching.

77
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:48,405
If you look below from where Mr. Sekiguchi was hung,

78
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:50,605
the pointed bars of the steel fence comes into view

79
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:52,705
and it's kind of scary.

80
00:05:52,706 --> 00:05:54,005
I see!

81
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:57,205
Shigeko who has beloniphobia would probably avoid this place

82
00:05:57,206 --> 00:05:59,605
and hang the victim more to the side.

83
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:01,506
Conan, way to go!

84
00:06:03,706 --> 00:06:06,405
The chauffeur Mr. Watabiki was driving the car

85
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:09,405
together with Mr. and Mr. Kunitomo at the time of the murder.

86
00:06:09,406 --> 00:06:11,405
So he couldn't have committed the murder.

87
00:06:11,406 --> 00:06:15,805
Which means you're the only one left, Mr. Akatsuka.

88
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:17,405
No.

89
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:19,406
I don't think the steward did it either!

90
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:23,305
Look at the two cards carefully.

91
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:27,106
The writing is slanted and slightly out of place, right?

92
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:34,205
Come to think of it...

93
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:38,005
In other words, Mr. Akatsuka who is a meticulous perfectionist

94
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:41,705
would never write such a card.

95
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:45,305
But the killer could've pretended

96
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:50,006
to have such a habit or phobia to throw people off.

97
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:54,905
Conan...

98
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:57,105
Just as Conan has mentioned,

99
00:06:57,106 --> 00:07:00,406
all of the habits and phobia can deliberately be acted out.

100
00:07:01,406 --> 00:07:02,505
At any rate,

101
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:03,605
I would like you all to come down once

102
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:07,005
so that I can interrogate you individually.

103
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,906
I would like to also take your fingerprints.

104
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:11,405
Of all things,

105
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:15,205
why do we have to get our fingerprints taken, too?

106
00:07:15,206 --> 00:07:16,605
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:19,805
I need it to make out which fingerprint is the killer's.

108
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:23,805
And? What about the alibis of the rest of the suspects?

109
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:28,505
The alibis of everyone except Mr. Watabiki are quite ambiguous.

110
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:32,305
So everyone's fingerprints were taken except for Mr. Kunitomo's,

111
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:36,806
but only Mr. Sekiguchi's fingerprints were found on the rope so far.

112
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:40,705
Why didn't you take the fingerprints of Mr. Kunitomo?

113
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:42,405
Well...

114
00:07:42,406 --> 00:07:46,105
He said he won't see anybody until October 4th is over

115
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:47,805
and locked himself in the room on the third floor.

116
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:51,005
Hey, dear. Will you cut it out?

117
00:07:51,006 --> 00:07:54,105
-Dear? -Well, hold your horses.

118
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:58,106
If something comes up, we can discuss it later, you and me.

119
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:01,505
I'll see you later.

120
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:02,506
Dear?

121
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:07,706
This is absurd!

122
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:10,805
Dear?

123
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:14,505
Don't tell me that there's somebody in there with Mr. Kunitomo?

124
00:08:14,506 --> 00:08:16,405
-Huh? -It can't be!

125
00:08:16,406 --> 00:08:19,205
He said that he didn't want to see anybody, didn't he?

126
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:20,705
Mrs. Kunitomo.

127
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:23,505
Where is this interphone connected to?

128
00:08:23,506 --> 00:08:26,005
Our bedroom.

129
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,705
In other words, it's the room where Mr. Sekiguchi was hanging,

130
00:08:28,706 --> 00:08:30,306
the room right above ours!

131
00:08:31,406 --> 00:08:32,806
Conan!

132
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:50,206
Rope?

133
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,206
Hey, Conan.

134
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:10,005
The pill has been crushed.

135
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:12,306
There was somebody here after all.

136
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:16,505
But there are no traces of the window being forced opened.

137
00:09:16,506 --> 00:09:19,905
He couldn't have forgotten to lock them under these circumstances.

138
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:21,905
How in the world

139
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:24,005
did the killer get inside?

140
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:26,405
We've got to call an ambulance right away.

141
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:28,906
Although under these circumstances, it may already be too late.

142
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:37,205
The thing that bothers me is that rope.

143
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:39,006
If my deduction is correct...

144
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:43,206
The culprit is still...

145
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:46,005
What?

146
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:50,005
The boy with the glasses got into the room on the third floor?

147
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,805
There was a rope tied to the veranda where Mr. Sekiguchi was found hanging

148
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:55,406
so he climbed up that rope to the third floor.

149
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:58,205
Hey, kid!

150
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:00,305
-Open up! -Hey.

151
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:02,706
Hurry up and open the door!

152
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:12,505
Intruder...

153
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:13,605
-A bell? -Intruder.

154
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:19,705
Intruder...

155
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:23,105
What in the world is happening?

156
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:25,005
What's with this alarm?

157
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:26,205
Did you do something?

158
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:27,505
Conan?

159
00:10:27,506 --> 00:10:28,805
Sorry.

160
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:31,505
Dad tried to force his way in

161
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:34,005
and touched the fingerprint recognition device

162
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:37,906
despite that only the people who live here are allowed to touch it.

163
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,505
At any rate, stop the alarm and open the door.

164
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:44,605
Do you know where the button is?

165
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:46,205
I'll open the door now.

166
00:10:46,206 --> 00:10:50,206
But other than Pops and Officer Yokomizo, please don't come inside.

167
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:53,606
But they're already...

168
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:57,506
Master!

169
00:10:57,507 --> 00:11:00,006
Hey, hey, everybody's inside.

170
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:05,506
His pulse is gone and he's not breathing.

171
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:08,705
Dear? Why?

172
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:10,505
I'll call an ambulance!

173
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:13,005
I'll go inform the officer who is below about this.

174
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,306
Wait!

175
00:11:15,806 --> 00:11:18,506
I already called the ambulance.

176
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:22,406
Everyone, please don't move from here.

177
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:31,114
Ran?

178
00:11:31,115 --> 00:11:33,115
Are you still outside the door?

179
00:11:34,815 --> 00:11:36,114
I'm here.

180
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:39,914
Then look out for any strange person that comes out, okay?

181
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:42,514
Inspector Yokomizo and Pops,

182
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:44,414
will you both check to see if there are traces of the windows

183
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:47,714
of the other rooms on the third floor having been forced opened?

184
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:49,914
Why?

185
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:51,415
Look at this.

186
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:57,614
This is a trace of pills being stepped on, right?

187
00:11:57,615 --> 00:12:00,914
It means somebody was here, right?

188
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:02,714
Right.

189
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:05,114
Whoever it was probably surprised Mr. Kunitomo,

190
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:09,914
causing him to get an attack and kept him from having his medicine.

191
00:12:09,915 --> 00:12:11,614
And this rope...

192
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:15,114
Is probably what the killer used to get away.

193
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:16,414
It wasn't swaying!

194
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:17,815
-What? -Huh?

195
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:23,314
I heard Mr. Kunitomo's loud voice from the interphone on the third floor,

196
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:26,314
so I went to the room downstairs and found the rope.

197
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:27,814
It didn't even take me a minute.

198
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,814
Hey. Don't tell me...

199
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:34,914
Right. Maybe the killer saw me climbing the rope

200
00:12:34,915 --> 00:12:38,714
and decided not to run away, but came back to this room instead?

201
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:40,614
Could be.

202
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:44,114
If the killer surprised Mr. Kunitomo to induce a heart attack,

203
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:48,114
took the medicine bottle away, stepped on the pill and crush it

204
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:51,214
and fled after making sure that Mr. Kunitomo was dead,

205
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:53,314
it would take at least a minute.

206
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,914
The rope should still be swaying.

207
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:58,014
Which means that

208
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:02,015
it is very likely that the killer is still here on the third floor.

209
00:13:05,515 --> 00:13:07,614
Why don't we split up and look for the killer?

210
00:13:07,615 --> 00:13:08,914
Good idea!

211
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:10,215
That's too dangerous.

212
00:13:11,215 --> 00:13:13,714
What if you run into the killer?

213
00:13:13,715 --> 00:13:17,314
But if we dilly-dally, the killer will get away!

214
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:20,215
Wouldn't it be faster if we all go look for the killer together?

215
00:13:22,015 --> 00:13:23,614
Okay, let's do this then.

216
00:13:23,615 --> 00:13:25,714
We search one room at a time.

217
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:28,814
First, I'll go in an check the windows.

218
00:13:28,815 --> 00:13:31,415
You all come into the room after me.

219
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:34,014
Mr. Mouri, please go out into the corridor

220
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:37,114
and stay on the look out for any suspicious person.

221
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:39,415
Okay!

222
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:48,414
Nothing abnormal!

223
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,615
Please come in.

224
00:13:52,015 --> 00:13:54,114
Nobody's here.

225
00:13:54,115 --> 00:13:55,514
No one here either.

226
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:57,415
Let's go on to the next room then.

227
00:13:59,315 --> 00:14:04,414
We searched all the rooms, but there was no suspicious person anywhere.

228
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:08,414
Moreover, all the windows on the third floor were locked from the inside

229
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:11,115
and there were no traces of the windows being forced opened either.

230
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,714
Hey, Ran! Can you hear me?

231
00:14:16,715 --> 00:14:19,715
Have you seen anyone leave from that door?

232
00:14:21,315 --> 00:14:25,214
Three paramedics carrying a stretcher went in and out though.

233
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:27,514
Nobody besides them passed.

234
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:29,215
Which means that...

235
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:34,514
This kid is making up stories.

236
00:14:34,515 --> 00:14:36,114
What's with you, man?

237
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:38,614
No, there is still another possibility.

238
00:14:38,615 --> 00:14:39,615
Huh?

239
00:14:39,616 --> 00:14:41,814
When Conan opened the door with the fingerprint recognition device

240
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:44,514
and we went inside,

241
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:46,614
the killer who was hiding on the third floor

242
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:49,814
could've joined in among us.

243
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:51,414
No way.

244
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:52,914
Wait a sec!

245
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:55,514
Are you saying that the killer is among us?

246
00:14:55,515 --> 00:14:57,114
Well, not really.

247
00:14:57,115 --> 00:15:00,914
We all ran here after hearing the alarm, you know!

248
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:04,914
Didn't you see us come in from behind you?

249
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:10,914
Well, I do remember that Mrs. Kunitomo was with us right through, but...

250
00:15:10,915 --> 00:15:12,215
Mr. Mouri, do you remember?

251
00:15:13,415 --> 00:15:14,614
Not at all.

252
00:15:14,615 --> 00:15:17,914
Didn't I tell you not to let anybody else inside?

253
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:22,414
We'll appoint an officer to stand guard in front of the security door

254
00:15:22,415 --> 00:15:24,714
and close off the third floor.

255
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:28,614
As for all of you, please let me question you once again,

256
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:29,815
understood?

257
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:36,214
In other words, when Mr. Kunitomo was heard shouting over the interphone

258
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:38,414
of the third floor with the fingerprint recognition device,

259
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:40,514
aside from Mrs. Kunitomo who was with us,

260
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:44,214
the alibis of the four of you are ambiguous.

261
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:46,114
Ambiguous?

262
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:51,114
We were staying still in our rooms just as the police told us to.

263
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:53,614
We all have our own rooms.

264
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:55,014
Why didn't you appoint an officer

265
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:58,114
to stand guard in front of our rooms then?

266
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:00,114
Oh, well...

267
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:01,814
The point is,

268
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:03,714
regardless of Mr. Kunitomo saying that

269
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:07,414
he would not see anyone until October 4th is over,

270
00:16:07,415 --> 00:16:10,314
how did the killer enter the room?

271
00:16:10,315 --> 00:16:12,714
Come to think of it, back then

272
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:16,015
along with my husband's voice through the interphone...

273
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:21,014
I'll see you later.

274
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:23,015
I think I heard what sounded like a knock.

275
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:28,614
My husband didn't seem to be surprised by that sound.

276
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:30,314
A knock.

277
00:16:30,315 --> 00:16:36,214
And right after that, he suddenly shouted and started suffering?

278
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:37,814
Yes.

279
00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:41,814
Don't tell me that he invited someone in on his own?

280
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:43,714
That can't be.

281
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:46,114
Mr. Kunitomo sent the officers who were investigating the third floor

282
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:47,414
on Mr. Sekiguchi's case out

283
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:50,614
and confined himself to his room on the third floor, you know?

284
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:52,215
Why would he invite someone in?

285
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:55,514
Even if he were to have done so,

286
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:59,214
the distance between the interphone beside the bed and the door of the room

287
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:01,014
is pretty far.

288
00:17:01,015 --> 00:17:02,514
It's unthinkable that he'd have an attack

289
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:05,514
just because the killer opened the door.

290
00:17:05,515 --> 00:17:08,114
Even if the killer were to have some kind of weapon on him,

291
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:10,014
if his hands were on the interphone,

292
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:11,914
he would probably have put his finger in the fingerprint recognition device

293
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:14,014
and opened the door.

294
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:16,814
What frightened him to the point of not even being able to do so?

295
00:17:16,815 --> 00:17:18,714
What on earth could it be?

296
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:23,814
Let's go over all the incidents that happened so far.

297
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:27,614
Please start by telling me about the ship accident

298
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,715
that occurred 13 years ago off shore Suruga Bay.

299
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:33,514
Did anything out of the ordinary happen before it set sail?

300
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:36,814
I went to see everyone off at the harbour,

301
00:17:36,815 --> 00:17:38,614
but nothing other than Mrs. Kunitomo's friend,

302
00:17:38,615 --> 00:17:43,414
Mr. Sekiguchi suddenly participating happened.

303
00:17:43,415 --> 00:17:46,014
Why did Mr. Sekiguchi suddenly decide to participate?

304
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:50,614
He had been wanting to go cruising with us from some time ago

305
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:53,514
and it just so happened that Namika and Shigeko came down with a cold

306
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:56,015
and the number of people boarding decreased.

307
00:17:57,015 --> 00:17:59,514
If I were to mention something I thought was strange...

308
00:17:59,515 --> 00:18:03,514
Mr. Sekiguchi was carrying a large bag.

309
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,114
And the contents?

310
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:10,814
I'm sure he said it was scuba diving equipment.

311
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,414
I see.

312
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:16,114
And the people that died back then were,

313
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:20,514
first of all, is the chef that used to work here, and Shieko's husband,

314
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:22,514
as well as Namika's father.

315
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:28,314
The second is Mr. Watabiki's father who worked here as a chauffeur.

316
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,314
The third is Mr. Watabiki's younger brother who happened to participate

317
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:33,414
and go on board.

318
00:18:33,415 --> 00:18:39,214
And the fourth was your wife who worked here as a housekeeper, right?

319
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:40,614
Yes.

320
00:18:40,615 --> 00:18:43,814
You said that Mr. and Mrs. Kunitomo and Mr. Sekiguchi

321
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:48,914
were the only ones who survived, but were there other boats on board?

322
00:18:48,915 --> 00:18:52,814
There were, but we were so desperate to save ourselves

323
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:56,414
that I have no idea whether the others got on or not.

324
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:59,414
I'm not even sure whether an SOS was sent out either.

325
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:01,114
And after that,

326
00:19:01,115 --> 00:19:04,614
your husband start having nightmares, almost got into a car accident,

327
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:06,814
this strange card was delivered,

328
00:19:06,815 --> 00:19:09,214
the dish cabinet falls over in the middle of the night,

329
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:12,314
and you heard strange sounds in the house.

330
00:19:12,315 --> 00:19:15,514
Did anyone here realize that these things were all happening

331
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:18,414
on the 4th of Butsumetsu?

332
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:22,414
Well, I did realize that it was always the 4th, but...

333
00:19:22,415 --> 00:19:26,714
Maybe the master was aware.

334
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:28,714
He used to be hooked on the 6-day calendar, and he used to choose

335
00:19:28,715 --> 00:19:31,614
lucky days marked on the calendar whenever going cruising.

336
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:34,314
And on the day before something was bound to happen,

337
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:37,514
he used to always invite Mr. Sekiguchi over.

338
00:19:37,515 --> 00:19:40,314
Then was Mr. Sekiguchi at the house

339
00:19:40,315 --> 00:19:42,714
when Mr. and Mrs. Kunitomo heard strange noises

340
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,914
in the house where no one else was supposed to be?

341
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:46,514
Yes.

342
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:48,314
Mrs. Kunimoto.

343
00:19:48,315 --> 00:19:50,814
What kind of sound was it?

344
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,314
Let's see...

345
00:19:52,315 --> 00:19:54,814
It sounded like something being hit against the wall,

346
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:57,914
like "thud", "thud".

347
00:19:57,915 --> 00:20:00,714
And "slash", like leather being hit.

348
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:02,314
It's as if a ball is being hit against the wall

349
00:20:02,315 --> 00:20:05,014
and being caught with a glove.

350
00:20:05,015 --> 00:20:07,515
Is there anyone who plays baseball in this house?

351
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:11,914
I don't.

352
00:20:11,915 --> 00:20:14,114
But my younger brother who died did.

353
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:16,314
Hey, hold it.

354
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,814
Don't tell me that it's a ghost after all.

355
00:20:19,815 --> 00:20:21,514
What?

356
00:20:21,515 --> 00:20:25,214
His nightmare is about the housekeeper that makes the bed.

357
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,914
The car accident is the chauffeur.

358
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:30,014
The dish cabinet is the chef.

359
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:33,714
And if the strange sound is baseball,

360
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:38,015
it all has to do with people who died 13 years ago.

361
00:20:40,215 --> 00:20:42,814
Then don't tell me that the words that are written on the card,

362
00:20:42,815 --> 00:20:46,514
"Atone your sins before I shall awaken. I am the fifth soul."

363
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:49,314
means the spirits of the dead are going to resurrect one after the other?

364
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:52,214
No!

365
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:54,915
Mrs. Kunitomo! Are you all right, Mrs. Kunitomo?

366
00:20:56,415 --> 00:20:59,114
It's a curse after all.

367
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:01,914
This house is possessed by evil spirits.

368
00:21:01,915 --> 00:21:03,514
Don't be ridiculous.

369
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:07,214
There are no such things as evil spirits in this world!

370
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:08,814
But a spirit could easily

371
00:21:08,815 --> 00:21:12,814
go through the door with the fingerprint recognition device, couldn't it?

372
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:16,514
Right! I'm sure Mr. Kunitomo also saw that ghost!

373
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:18,414
No way!

374
00:21:18,415 --> 00:21:19,615
Right, Inspector Yokomizo?

375
00:21:25,715 --> 00:21:27,214
Well...

376
00:21:27,215 --> 00:21:31,214
It's just that my cell phone rang at such good timing.

377
00:21:31,215 --> 00:21:32,814
Yes. This is Yokomizo!

378
00:21:32,815 --> 00:21:34,214
Gosh!

379
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:35,815
Oh, forensics?

380
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:40,215
What? Fingerprints were detected from the rope and medicine bottle?

381
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:42,814
Yes.

382
00:21:42,815 --> 00:21:45,214
Yes. Then there's no mistake that the prints

383
00:21:45,215 --> 00:21:49,214
are those of the person who last touched the bottle?

384
00:21:49,215 --> 00:21:52,414
So it's the same as having already nabbed the killer!

385
00:21:52,415 --> 00:21:56,014
Because all your fingerprints have already been taken.

386
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:59,314
And? Whose fingerprints did it match?

387
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:02,314
Well...

388
00:22:02,315 --> 00:22:05,814
It doesn't match anyone who works in this house.

389
00:22:05,815 --> 00:22:08,814
It's an unknown fingerprint.

390
00:22:08,815 --> 00:22:09,914
What?

391
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:11,015
No way!

392
00:22:12,115 --> 00:22:16,414
Then how did the killer get through that door?

393
00:22:16,415 --> 00:22:18,015
I wonder?

394
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:20,614
Evil spirits.

395
00:22:20,615 --> 00:22:22,715
It's the evil spirits after all.

396
00:22:27,615 --> 00:22:29,615
Isn't it getting very interesting?

397
00:23:57,615 --> 00:24:00,914
"Next Episode" -Which means that 13 years ago on September 26th,

398
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:03,814
the president disappeared?

399
00:24:03,815 --> 00:24:07,714
So if we're done, I'd like to get back to work!

400
00:24:07,715 --> 00:24:09,715
Was someone there or not? Which is it?

401
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:12,914
No one was there...

402
00:24:12,915 --> 00:24:16,614
Yes, there was a suspicious figure.

403
00:24:16,615 --> 00:24:22,114
Let me explain the truth of the two murders that took place here.

404
00:24:22,115 --> 00:24:27,615
Next Conan, "The Evil Spirit that Appears on Butsumetsu (Solution)"

405
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,614
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:47,614
"Siblings."

407
00:24:47,615 --> 00:24:48,615
The next episode is finally the solution!

408
00:24:48,616 --> 00:24:50,514
Or maybe it is the work of evil spirits after all.

409
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:52,415
-Hey! -I'm sorry.
