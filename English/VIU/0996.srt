00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,480
Welcome to Traditional-style House Café Takehara

2
00:00:19,658 --> 00:00:22,667
A falcon? No, is it an eagle?

3
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:23,807
It's a hawk.

4
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,517
It's a raptor called a Harris's hawk.

5
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:27,578
Move.

6
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:31,208
Your eyes are like mine.

7
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,248
They're sharp.

8
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:39,928
You'll stress out the hawk if you point or wave at him!

9
00:00:40,258 --> 00:00:42,927
Hawks are delicate creatures!

10
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:44,138
Be careful!

11
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:46,888
S-Sorry.

12
00:00:48,718 --> 00:00:51,448
Your fault for showing off, old man.

13
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,027
Find the question that solves the mystery!

14
00:00:56,028 --> 00:00:58,108
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

15
00:00:58,288 --> 00:01:00,307
A traditional-style home café holds a falconry event.

16
00:01:00,308 --> 00:01:02,627
Determine the trick using your keen eyes.

17
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:04,367
Always determining the one truth

18
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:06,127
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

19
00:01:06,128 --> 00:01:08,538
his name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:54,387
The Skilled Hawk Hides His Crimes

21
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:57,398
Welcome to Traditional-style House Café Takehara

22
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:13,335
Are you really holding some kind of festival?

23
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:17,935
You're lucky. You have the whole place to yourselves today.

24
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:19,934
I see.

25
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:22,415
Here's your tea.

26
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:30,245
It's quiet today, but this place was thriving until recently.

27
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:34,104
Allow me to introduce Takehara Genichi.

28
00:03:34,105 --> 00:03:37,924
He quit his office job to open a traditional-style home café,

29
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:41,095
and is currently holding an event to revitalize his mountain village.

30
00:03:41,665 --> 00:03:47,465
Serene and beautiful mountain villages have the mysterious ability to soothe people's hearts.

31
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:52,115
I began this event because I wanted more people to learn about that.

32
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:54,904
I see.

33
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:58,674
Experiencing an event while surrounded by nature does seem like it would

34
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:02,475
produce memories a little different from one's everyday life.

35
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:04,564
I'm going to the bathroom.

36
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:05,235
Okay.

37
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:09,634
I told you not to come here.

38
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:13,615
I'm sorry. I forgot to get your signature in one spot.

39
00:04:17,455 --> 00:04:20,495
You haven't told anyone?

40
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:23,615
I told my wife.

41
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:26,015
There's no need to tell anyone else.

42
00:04:26,535 --> 00:04:29,385
They'd probably kill me if I did.

43
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:32,165
Here. How's this?

44
00:04:32,935 --> 00:04:34,385
Good, thank you.

45
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,394
That wasn't a customer?

46
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:43,814
No. Apparently he was lost.

47
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:45,385
I see.

48
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:50,404
Honey, could we get some boar?

49
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:51,615
Sure.

50
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:53,415
Boar?

51
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:55,745
Do you like Botan stew?

52
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,945
Botan stew? I love Botan stew.

53
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:03,935
Oh, Botan stew is made with boar meat.

54
00:05:04,465 --> 00:05:07,384
I hope I'm able to catch one.

55
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:09,455
I look forward to it.

56
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:15,875
Is something wrong?

57
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:17,714
No.

58
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:19,615
Oh, I know.

59
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:27,065
Wow, this is amazing.

60
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:29,534
I made it myself.

61
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:33,695
Really? Wait, did you make everything here?

62
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:40,265
Yeah. I made all the animals in the café.

63
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:43,094
When my husband quit his office job,

64
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:46,304
he asked me to open this café with him,

65
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,994
so I quit my office job, too.

66
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:52,424
But this was my only skill,

67
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:54,965
so I made these while running the café.

68
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:59,174
These animals are the physical representation of the experience

69
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:01,595
and memories I made working at this café.

70
00:06:02,315 --> 00:06:04,055
I'll be back.

71
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:09,884
Be careful.

72
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:11,734
I know.

73
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:13,235
See you later.

74
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:17,204
Good luck with your hunt.

75
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:18,375
Thank you.

76
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:21,865
13:00 Puffed rice making event 13:30 Puffed rice complete

77
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:24,875
This rice came from my fields.

78
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,155
Let's feed this into the machine.

79
00:06:29,685 --> 00:06:31,755
Then we close the lid, light the fire,

80
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:37,885
and turn it while waiting for the pressure to rise.

81
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:42,265
I used to go into the city to sell puffed rice.

82
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,934
Tons of kids around your age would gather.

83
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:48,115
It was a lot of fun.

84
00:06:48,545 --> 00:06:54,275
But now I'm the only one in this area who makes puffed rice.

85
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:58,535
The other farmers who grew rice quit farming, too.

86
00:06:58,945 --> 00:07:05,285
So I'm grateful to Genichi-san for allowing me to make puffed rice at this café.

87
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:07,515
I'm truly grateful.

88
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:11,585
Once the pressure is high enough,

89
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:14,795
we close the lid so the puffed rice doesn't go flying.

90
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:19,014
Right on time.

91
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:19,805
Okay, then.

92
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:22,175
Here we go.

93
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:33,105
What's wrong?

94
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:36,815
You look like a dove that's been shot by a pea shooter.

95
00:07:38,435 --> 00:07:40,735
It was a bit loud.

96
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:44,665
Actually, I think I just heard a gunshot.

97
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:52,165
Finally, we coat the rice with sugar water and mix well.

98
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,285
And it's done.

99
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:56,635
Eat up.

100
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:02,175
Delicious!

101
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:06,194
Is that her husband?

102
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,484
Hey!

103
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:11,185
Bring us a nice juicy boar!

104
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:17,405
Be careful!

105
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:26,035
L-Like this?

106
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:29,225
You're okay. Try to relax.

107
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,645
Hawks can sense your nervousness.

108
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:34,365
Don't be scared.

109
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:35,915
Okay.

110
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:38,425
Now pick up the food.

111
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,475
Okay.

112
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:46,655
Here we go.

113
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:59,324
I did it. I did it, Conan-kun.

114
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:01,514
That's amazing, Ran-neechan.

115
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:03,764
Conan-kun, you're next. Give it a shot.

116
00:09:03,765 --> 00:09:04,485
What?

117
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,814
Thank you.

118
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,495
No problem.

119
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:10,704
You're scared of hawks, huh?

120
00:09:10,705 --> 00:09:11,375
What?

121
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:12,725
Oh, nothing.

122
00:09:13,645 --> 00:09:15,504
I like birds.

123
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:19,554
Among them, raptors are my favorite, especially hawks.

124
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:22,315
That's why I started this job.

125
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:27,784
Things are quiet now, but lots of people used to come before.

126
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:30,895
It was fun and felt worthwhile.

127
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:36,275
I'm hoping to liven up this place with this guy like we used to.

128
00:09:36,515 --> 00:09:42,525
So if you could promote today's event at school,

129
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,475
I'd appreciate it.

130
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:45,875
Okay.

131
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,155
Of course.

132
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:55,455
Dad, why don't you try it?

133
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:58,135
Huh? I'm not interested.

134
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:00,825
It's because he got yelled at earlier.

135
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:04,144
This concludes the falconry show.

136
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,904
Botan stew is next.

137
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,845
Now this is what I've been waiting for!

138
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:09,344
Not yet.

139
00:10:09,345 --> 00:10:11,395
You haven't done that yet, have you?

140
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:13,895
What haven't we done?

141
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:17,895
The main event of our café's Okuho Mountain Village Festival.

142
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:21,205
We send the hawk to the target over there.

143
00:10:27,195 --> 00:10:34,285
There's a lure with rabbit fur and meat hanging in a clearing on that mountain.

144
00:10:34,555 --> 00:10:37,514
We have him fly all the way there.

145
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:40,295
Seems pretty far. Can he do that?

146
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:42,575
Yeah, just watch.

147
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:04,445
Is that my husband?

148
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,164
What was that?

149
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,325
Conan-kun!

150
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:08,695
Dad!

151
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:15,125
Sir. Sir!

152
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:16,915
Excuse me.

153
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:26,425
Unfortunately... Ran, call the police.

154
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:27,925
Got it.

155
00:11:28,095 --> 00:11:30,975
No. Honey...

156
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:34,095
Honey!

157
00:11:41,585 --> 00:11:44,315
Was it accidentally fired?

158
00:11:47,055 --> 00:11:50,325
So, Mori-kun, you're saying it was an accident?

159
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:51,175
Yes.

160
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:56,994
The victim Takehara Genichi-san was inside the thicket with a shotgun.

161
00:11:56,995 --> 00:11:59,695
The hawk attacked him in there.

162
00:12:00,665 --> 00:12:05,434
Genichi-san fired his shotgun in an attempt to defend himself.

163
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:10,345
However, the shell unfortunately struck Genichi-san himself.

164
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:11,675
That's not possible!

165
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:15,805
A hawk would never attack a person.

166
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:18,424
Hawks are afraid of people.

167
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:22,185
Not just hawks. Most animals are.

168
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:25,014
But what if a gun were pointed at it?

169
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:29,424
You said just pointing at a hawk with your finger is a bad idea.

170
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:31,945
I did say that, but...

171
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,044
I thought I saw something shining around here

172
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,455
when the hawk changed direction.

173
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:40,004
Shining?

174
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:43,835
Pardon me. Did you find anything around here that shines?

175
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:45,734
No, nothing.

176
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:47,335
Not particularly.

177
00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:51,854
Perhaps it was the sunlight reflecting off his shotgun.

178
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:56,684
But, Mori-kun, unlike other guns, shotguns have long barrels.

179
00:12:56,685 --> 00:13:00,544
Is it possible for someone to accidentally shoot themselves with one?

180
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:03,355
I think this is an exceptional case.

181
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:07,584
He probably held the gun like this, then this,

182
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:09,494
and from here, like this.

183
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:11,364
And finally, this.

184
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:12,995
Mori-kun...

185
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:15,174
Dad.

186
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:18,115
Ran, how's the wife doing?

187
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:22,625
She seems okay, but there's no telling how she really feels.

188
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:24,285
I see.

189
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,140
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:56,140
I know Genichi-san won't come back no matter how much I apologize.

191
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,479
But I'm really sorry.

192
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,719
Don't worry about it, Akashiba-kun.

193
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,020
It was an accident.

194
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,839
It's not your fault.

195
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,410
Don't blame yourself or your hawk.

196
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,710
But...

197
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,889
Akashiba-kun, listen to her.

198
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:17,160
She's having the hardest time dealing with this.

199
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,079
A-All right.

200
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,339
This is probably the last year we'll hold this event.

201
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,260
Nobody will come after this.

202
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:26,719
No! We have to keep going.

203
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,000
My husband won't be able to rest in peace if we stop now.

204
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:53,820
Wait.

205
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,699
What are you doing?

206
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,330
What?

207
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,889
You're not going to kill your hawk, are you?

208
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,960
I wouldn't do that.

209
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,129
I started this job because I love hawks.

210
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,650
No falconer would kill his own hawk.

211
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,159
Then what's that medicine?

212
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,180
Oh, this?

213
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,890
It's for his injured foot.

214
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,320
I see.

215
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,350
How was he injured?

216
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,949
I don't know.

217
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,949
But ankle injuries can be fatal to hawks.

218
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,730
I'm glad it wasn't serious.

219
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,610
When do hawks injure their ankles?

220
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,189
There can be a lot of causes,

221
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,480
like getting caught in crow guards or fishing line.

222
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,640
These two were stuck together.

223
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,800
Okay. I know the approximate shape.

224
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,510
What's this?

225
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,930
Yahoo!

226
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,000
Yahoo!

227
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,929
You made all of these, right?

228
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,339
I'm glad you like them.

229
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,949
You're quite dexterous.

230
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm good at woodworking.

231
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,960
Have some tea.

232
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:38,260
Thank you.

233
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,709
Inspector Megure, we're ready to leave.

234
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,520
Got it.

235
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,020
I guess we'll get going, too.

236
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,320
I thought we were leaving...

237
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,999
Mori-kun, could it be?

238
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,769
Inspector, could you gather everyone?

239
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,009
I have something important to discuss.

240
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,080
Takagi-kun.

241
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:06,830
Yes, sir.

242
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,340
What important thing did you want to discuss?

243
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,470
Genichi-san didn't die in an accident.

244
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,970
He what?

245
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,220
A device was used to disguise his death as an accident.

246
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,480
What device?

247
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,980
There was fishing line strung up where the husband died.

248
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,610
The hawk flew off course because its feet got caught on it.

249
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,629
But, Mori-san, we didn't find any fishing line at the scene.

250
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,930
It was at the bottom of a nearby ravine, wrapped around a wooden drum.

251
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,120
The culprit must've wrapped the fishing line around the drum

252
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:53,630
and dropped it down the ravine so it wouldn't remain at the crime scene.

253
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,510
But what was the fishing line for?

254
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,460
To fire a shotgun.

255
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,510
The thread was tied to a shotgun set up in the thicket.

256
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,270
The thread was drawn in front of the hawk's target.

257
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,650
When the hawk's feet got caught in the line,

258
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,260
it pulled the trigger on the shotgun,

259
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,900
firing a shell.

260
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:22,420
That shell pierced the fastener on the device supporting Genichi-san's body.

261
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,470
With the fastener gone, it began to move.

262
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,210
It pushed Genichi-san's body out of the thicket, while the device itself fell down the ravine.

263
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,090
The shotgun was also dragged down by the fishing line and left at the crime scene.

264
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,689
But Mori-san, why did the culprit set up that device?

265
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,569
To create an alibi.

266
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,519
Genichi-san was murdered before then.

267
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,230
When was that?

268
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,730
When the puffed rice was made.

269
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,230
The events of this festival occur at fixed times.

270
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,240
Ishima-san, who is in charge of the puffed rice demonstration, was exactly on schedule.

271
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:09,040
The culprit knew this and killed the husband as the puffed rice machine made a loud noise.

272
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,750
At that time, I thought I heard a gunshot in what I believed to be an echo.

273
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,760
Bring us a nice juicy boar!

274
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,510
But there was no echo when I shouted to the person I thought was the husband.

275
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,930
Then who waved to us then?

276
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,390
The culprit.

277
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,569
And the person absent at that time was you, ma'am.

278
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,420
What?

279
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:41,570
Me?

280
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,289
You thought you could disguise the gunshot

281
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,080
if you shot him during the puffed rice demonstration, didn't you?

282
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,960
Do you have any proof?

283
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,300
Indeed I do.

284
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,710
It's that red stain on your neck.

285
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,820
There's was a bloodstain on the same spot on your husband's body.

286
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,990
The blood was also on your husband's hunting jacket.

287
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:14,100
It probably stained the same spot when you wore it.

288
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,860
Do you have more excuses?

289
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,610
No. I did it.

290
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,620
Could you tell us why?

291
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,370
He was trying to sell this place.

292
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,980
How's this?

293
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,249
Good. That seals our sale agreement.

294
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,130
Yeah.

295
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,190
I should get going.

296
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
Honey.

297
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,890
I'm selling this place and starting over.

298
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,279
We can't!

299
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,629
We built this place together.

300
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,149
And the others...

301
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,249
Shut up!

302
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,580
Don't talk back to me!

303
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,900
Fine.

304
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,150
I'll pack the animals and our things.

305
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,480
What are you talking about?

306
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,780
I'm leaving you and the café.

307
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,819
Don't get the wrong idea.

308
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,380
Both you and this café are a burden to me.

309
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,559
I didn't think he was like that.

310
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,549
I thought if I killed that man using the mountain village's power that he mocked,

311
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,550
then that poor hawk who was simply used for profit

312
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,960
would be repaid in some way.

313
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,699
Ma'am, you can tell us about it at the station.

314
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,690
Come with us, please.

315
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,330
Exterminating crows is an important job falconers perform.

316
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,039
All right!

317
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,210
Dad?

318
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,030
Hawk!

319
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,800
Hawks don't attack people, but crows do, so be careful.

320
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,219
Okay.

321
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,150
Should've left them alone!
