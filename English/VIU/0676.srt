1
00:00:01,297 --> 00:00:02,897
We, the members of the Youth Detective Squad

2
00:00:02,897 --> 00:00:04,297
along with Agasa are invited over

3
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:07,897
to the house of a couple we met at a camp site to have barbecue.

4
00:00:09,328 --> 00:00:11,628
The couple welcomes us when we get to their home,

5
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:14,153
and we all have barbecue together.

6
00:00:14,153 --> 00:00:16,553
The couple goes back into the house

7
00:00:16,553 --> 00:00:19,253
saying that the husband's cell phone is nowhere in sight.

8
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:23,153
The cell phone is found under the bench in the yard.

9
00:00:23,153 --> 00:00:24,953
When Ayumi goes to deliver the cell phone...

10
00:00:29,653 --> 00:00:33,453
I'm not forgiving you anymore!

11
00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:34,853
I'm gonna kill you!

12
00:00:34,853 --> 00:00:37,653
Hey, Sumika!

13
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:39,353
Cool it.

14
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:41,353
Sumika.

15
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:46,953
Die!

16
00:00:49,253 --> 00:00:51,653
Bad... bad news!

17
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:54,353
Those two are at it again!

18
00:00:54,353 --> 00:00:57,353
I tell you. Not again. Let them be.

19
00:00:57,353 --> 00:01:00,053
But the wife is holding a knife saying,

20
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:01,353
she's going to kill him.

21
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,153
-What? -What?

22
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:04,953
We've got to stop them, quick!

23
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:20,553
At first glance, it looked to be that the husband

24
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:25,153
accidentally stabbed his wife after they had an argument, but...

25
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:28,353
But, if that lady makes it,

26
00:01:28,353 --> 00:01:31,453
it's probably thanks to us who came here, right?

27
00:01:31,453 --> 00:01:34,453
Yes, I guess so.

28
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:36,153
If back then, the cell phone wasn't found

29
00:01:36,153 --> 00:01:38,853
and Ayumi didn't go to give it to him,

30
00:01:38,853 --> 00:01:41,153
we wouldn't have realized that the two were fighting

31
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:43,753
and maybe it would've been too late to save her.

32
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:48,653
Something just doesn't seem right.

33
00:01:48,653 --> 00:01:50,953
Everything's moving too smoothly.

34
00:01:50,953 --> 00:01:54,253
Like something's being manipulated.

35
00:01:58,353 --> 00:02:00,053
Oh, mail.

36
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,653
That's Mrs. Konno's cell phone that we found a while ago, right?

37
00:02:03,653 --> 00:02:06,353
-Yep. -Let me see it.

38
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:12,953
No, you shouldn't read other people's mail without permission.

39
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:15,253
This is...

40
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:16,853
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

41
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:20,553
The husband was saying that his wife sent mails saying, "Die, thief"

42
00:02:20,553 --> 00:02:24,053
to the women that sent him suspicious mails, right?

43
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:27,453
Yes, but there's nothing like that here.

44
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:29,453
It does seem that she was irritated

45
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:31,953
because she wasn't feeling good, though.

46
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:36,153
I see! That's why that cup was over there!

47
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:39,553
She wasn't feeling good, that is, she was feeling sick, right?

48
00:02:39,553 --> 00:02:42,953
It looked like the lady was about to drink medicine.

49
00:02:42,953 --> 00:02:46,953
Because I found a glass cup with water inside in the kitchen!

50
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:49,553
Glass cup with water?

51
00:02:49,553 --> 00:02:52,253
Then, did you find medicine nearby too?

52
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:56,353
No. The only other thing there was a sugar container.

53
00:02:56,353 --> 00:03:01,653
I was about to bring that water to the lady, but...

54
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:07,353
Are you all right, Genta?

55
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,953
Maybe you're the one who needs medicine, Genta.

56
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:12,353
Could it be that you have a cold?

57
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:17,553
No. My nose feels ticklish.

58
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:19,953
I can't stop...

59
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:23,653
Then, why don't you try holding the space below your nose

60
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:25,853
with your index finger and blocking off your nostrils?

61
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:27,753
Like this?

62
00:03:27,753 --> 00:03:31,553
If that doesn't work, pinch your nose.

63
00:03:31,553 --> 00:03:32,853
It stopped!

64
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:36,153
Well, it's something like a lucky spell.

65
00:03:36,153 --> 00:03:38,153
Lucky spell...

66
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,153
Don't tell me it's...

67
00:03:43,253 --> 00:03:47,453
Don't tell me that he used it and attacked his wife.

68
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:52,653
The vivid colored memories of summer

69
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:54,853
solve mysteries all season round.

70
00:03:54,853 --> 00:03:56,753
A couple's brawl is the cause of the case?

71
00:03:56,753 --> 00:03:59,153
The feelings of the two that have gone astray.

72
00:03:59,153 --> 00:04:00,753
He sees through the one and only truth.

73
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:02,853
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

74
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:05,153
His name is Detective Conan!

75
00:05:46,282 --> 00:05:51,982
"Not Even a Millimeter of Forgiveness (Part 2)"

76
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:54,197
Lucky spell...

77
00:05:55,497 --> 00:05:56,997
Don't tell me that...

78
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:03,997
Don't tell me that he used it and attacked his wife.

79
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:09,497
But there's no proof at all to prove that for now.

80
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:12,697
The only thing we have to go on is his wife's testimony.

81
00:06:12,697 --> 00:06:14,497
Hey.

82
00:06:14,497 --> 00:06:16,997
Something's shining.

83
00:06:16,997 --> 00:06:17,897
What?

84
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:20,597
I just happened to take a video

85
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:24,397
of when Ayumi went to deliver the cell phone, you see.

86
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:25,697
Bad news!

87
00:06:25,697 --> 00:06:28,397
Those two are at it again!

88
00:06:28,397 --> 00:06:31,197
I tell you. Not again. Let them be.

89
00:06:31,197 --> 00:06:32,297
It's after this.

90
00:06:32,297 --> 00:06:34,897
But the wife is holding a knife saying,

91
00:06:34,897 --> 00:06:36,597
she's going to kill him.

92
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,897
Here.

93
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:42,997
The lamp on Ayumi's cell phone is on, see?

94
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:45,497
Yeah.

95
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:48,597
Maybe it's the telephone answering service?

96
00:06:48,597 --> 00:06:52,797
He said that he called his wife from this cell phone,

97
00:06:52,797 --> 00:06:55,097
so it just may be here.

98
00:06:55,097 --> 00:06:57,597
The little clue that may serve as a lead

99
00:06:57,597 --> 00:06:59,197
to the trick of Mrs. Konno being stabbed.

100
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:02,397
This is the answering service.

101
00:07:02,397 --> 00:07:05,097
There is one new message for you.

102
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:09,397
I'm not forgiving you anymore!

103
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:11,297
I'm gonna kill you!

104
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,997
Hey, Sumika.

105
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:14,597
Cool it.

106
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:15,597
Sumika.

107
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:17,697
Die!

108
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:21,997
Did it stop?

109
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:24,897
To listen to this message again...

110
00:07:24,897 --> 00:07:27,597
What does that last phrase mean?

111
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:29,597
It was Mrs. Konno's voice, wasn't it?

112
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:33,297
If I'm not mistaken, she said "Did it stop", didn't she?

113
00:07:33,297 --> 00:07:35,397
Just as I thought.

114
00:07:35,397 --> 00:07:38,497
This is not self-defense.

115
00:07:38,497 --> 00:07:40,397
He took advantage of his wife's personality,

116
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:42,697
and tried to kill her.

117
00:07:42,697 --> 00:07:44,197
Unaware at all that doing so,

118
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,397
would result in a situation so disastrous.

119
00:07:58,697 --> 00:08:00,697
"Surgery in progress"

120
00:08:06,797 --> 00:08:08,697
"Surgery in progress"

121
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,997
The lamp turned off!

122
00:08:10,997 --> 00:08:13,497
It seems the surgery has finished!

123
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,197
Sumika!

124
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:23,597
And, how did the surgery go?

125
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:25,197
Just fine!

126
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:27,997
The pulmonary artery was a bit damaged,

127
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:30,697
but since the treatment right after she was stabbed was appropriate,

128
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:32,297
it saved her life.

129
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:34,797
She should be discharged in a few weeks.

130
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:37,497
-All right! -All right!

131
00:08:37,497 --> 00:08:40,297
-Thank you very much. -Not at all.

132
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:41,997
Thank you very much.

133
00:08:42,997 --> 00:08:46,997
I've already reported to the police

134
00:08:46,997 --> 00:08:49,497
that this was an accident as a result of a brawl.

135
00:08:49,497 --> 00:08:50,597
I understand.

136
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:56,297
Please tell the officers that will be here in a while the details, too.

137
00:08:56,297 --> 00:08:59,397
Although it's an accident, no doubt it's a serious incident, you see.

138
00:08:59,397 --> 00:09:01,297
I know.

139
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:02,997
Well, after she recovers,

140
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:05,697
I'm sure your wife will be questioned too.

141
00:09:05,697 --> 00:09:08,397
At any rate, please watch yourselves when fighting with each other.

142
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:10,897
Yes. Thank you very much.

143
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:12,597
Take care.

144
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:20,597
Relief, guilt and fear.

145
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:24,597
If so, the next action that'll be taken is...

146
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:29,497
To spit it all out to the police

147
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:32,997
or flee from here.

148
00:09:32,997 --> 00:09:34,597
Or...

149
00:09:37,097 --> 00:09:38,197
What?

150
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:41,697
You were at the site where the wife was stabbed, too?

151
00:09:41,697 --> 00:09:45,097
Yeah, although we didn't see her get stabbed.

152
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:47,797
Ayumi saw her before she got stabbed though.

153
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:48,897
Yep.

154
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:51,997
Because I found the cell phone that Mr. Konno was looking for,

155
00:09:51,997 --> 00:09:54,497
and went to deliver it to where they both were.

156
00:09:54,497 --> 00:09:57,297
Then I saw Mrs. Konno was holding a knife...

157
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,297
I'm not forgiving you anymore!

158
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:02,697
I'm gonna kill you!

159
00:10:02,697 --> 00:10:03,897
I see.

160
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:06,197
After hearing about it from Ayumi,

161
00:10:06,197 --> 00:10:08,497
we rushed over to see Mrs. Konno

162
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:12,597
lying on the floor with a knife stabbed into her!

163
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:14,797
I see, I see.

164
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:16,697
I guess the husband stabbed her

165
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:18,997
while they were fighting with each other.

166
00:10:18,997 --> 00:10:21,997
And where's her husband now?

167
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:25,697
Huh? He was here till just a while ago.

168
00:10:25,697 --> 00:10:29,397
Come to think of it, Conan and Ai aren't here either.

169
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:31,897
True. I wonder where they went?

170
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,497
Maybe to the restroom or something?

171
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:36,466
"Beika General Hospital"

172
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:50,384
Are you going to run for it?

173
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,784
After doing what you did to your wife,

174
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:58,331
I'm asking you if you alone plan to cross over!

175
00:11:00,431 --> 00:11:02,231
Just what're you talking about?

176
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:06,131
I just came out to this roof to get some fresh air,

177
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:10,331
relieved that my wife was saved.

178
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:12,731
So, cut out your silly remark

179
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:14,631
and go back to where everyone else is.

180
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:19,131
I'll bet you're planning to jump off after we leave, right?

181
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:22,131
Is it because after your wife recovers

182
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:24,231
and is interrogated by the police,

183
00:11:24,231 --> 00:11:26,131
the truth will come to light?

184
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:29,531
The truth that you were planning to kill her to begin with?

185
00:11:31,131 --> 00:11:33,531
See, that look on your face.

186
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:37,331
You had the same look on your face when you heard from the doctor

187
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:40,831
about the police interrogation a while ago.

188
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:43,931
When you heard that your wife was saved,

189
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:45,731
tears flowed from your eyes,

190
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:47,831
but you were wearing a look of relief.

191
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:50,631
When you heard again that your wife was in critical condition,

192
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:52,831
you looked down and away

193
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:56,631
because of your feeling of guilt of having done something seriously bad.

194
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:59,631
After your wife's recovery,

195
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,831
to think that the entire truth would come to light,

196
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:06,431
you closed your lips tightly and opened your eyes wide,

197
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:08,431
this was the look of hidden fear.

198
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:12,031
If you unfortunately stabbed your wife in self-defense,

199
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,831
you wouldn't be wearing such a look.

200
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:16,331
Such a look...

201
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:19,731
Your friend saw it too, right?

202
00:12:19,731 --> 00:12:22,331
My wife flung up the knife to attack me

203
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:25,231
saying that she was going to kill me!

204
00:12:26,431 --> 00:12:27,931
I had no other choice but to do so,

205
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:30,131
in order to save myself.

206
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:32,331
I had no other choice!

207
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:35,531
-Your wife didn't try to kill you. -What?

208
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:38,331
She was just trying to shock you.

209
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:41,331
Shock me? Why?

210
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:44,731
-Because it didn't stop. -What?

211
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,831
Your hiccups!

212
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:50,931
Hiccups, to stop it?

213
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:53,931
That's why she flung up the knife,

214
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:56,431
saying that she was going to kill me?

215
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:01,131
That's ridiculous.

216
00:13:01,131 --> 00:13:04,731
You know her well too, don't you, your wife's personality?

217
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:06,431
Last Christmas,

218
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,131
she wore the reindeer outfit because you didn't accept her

219
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:12,231
wearing the mini skirt Santa outfit.

220
00:13:12,231 --> 00:13:15,231
She tried to delight us by welcoming us,

221
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:18,831
wearing a Halloween outfit, despite it being way past the date.

222
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,031
She's the type that would go all the way

223
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:21,131
without thinking of the consequences

224
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:23,831
if she thinks it'll please someone.

225
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:25,331
Being the of her nature,

226
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:28,931
if she sees you having trouble because your hiccups wouldn't stop,

227
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:30,331
it's really easy to assume that she would go all the way,

228
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:33,131
no matter how distasteful, to shock you,

229
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:36,131
in order to try to make it stop!

230
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:39,131
If you are hiccupping while trying to place a phone call

231
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:40,931
to your superior at the company,

232
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:42,331
and the more so, if she goes into the kitchen

233
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:45,931
and sees a fruit knife there!

234
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:49,031
Well, there seems to have been a cup with water in it

235
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:52,431
and a sugar container in the kitchen,

236
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,331
so your wife seems to have thought of other ways

237
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:57,731
to stop your hiccups, too.

238
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:59,231
Sugar?

239
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:02,931
There's a not too well known method of stopping hiccups

240
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:07,031
by shoving a spoonful of sugar down your throat too, you know.

241
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:10,131
In Japan, the well known method is

242
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:13,031
to make a person drink water or shock the person.

243
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:16,331
In other words, the trick that you set up is as follows.

244
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,931
First, you hinted that your cell phone is nowhere in sight,

245
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:24,831
in front of all of us that you invited over to have barbecue with.

246
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,631
Then you set it up so that your wife gets irritated

247
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:30,231
and that leads to a brawl.

248
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:34,431
Then, in order to make your wife help you look for the cell phone,

249
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:36,331
you lure her into the living room

250
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:40,631
and pretend to find your cell phone that you hid under the sofa.

251
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,531
You tell her that you want to make a call to your superior

252
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:45,131
because you didn't receive any mail from him.

253
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:47,331
Which after, you pretended to have the hiccups

254
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:50,131
and set her up.

255
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:52,431
After telling her that you want to make a call to the Department Head,

256
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:55,331
but your hiccups won't stop.

257
00:14:55,331 --> 00:14:58,831
Then you confirmed that your wife got hold of the knife

258
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,531
just as you expected,

259
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:03,131
and rang your wife's cell phone

260
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:06,131
that you hid under the barbecue bench beforehand.

261
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:08,431
You wanted anybody among us

262
00:15:08,431 --> 00:15:10,431
who came to deliver the cell phone to the living room,

263
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:15,531
to witness your wife coming at you with a knife.

264
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,231
This way, even if it were that you snatched the knife away from her,

265
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:19,131
and stabbed her instead,

266
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:22,931
it would look as if your wife who was irritated at you, tried to kill you,

267
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:27,131
so having no choice, you stabbed her in self-defense!

268
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:28,531
Well, ironically though,

269
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:32,131
on your wife's cell phone that you rang in order to acquire a witness,

270
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,031
the recording that serves as proof of this,

271
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:37,031
was clearly left behind on her answer phone.

272
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:39,931
There is one new message.

273
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:44,731
I'm not forgiving you anymore!

274
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:46,231
I'm gonna kill you!

275
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:48,431
Hey, Sumika.

276
00:15:48,431 --> 00:15:49,931
Cool it.

277
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:50,931
Sumika.

278
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:53,231
Die!

279
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:57,131
Did it stop?

280
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:05,931
But even without this answer phone recording,

281
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,031
once your wife recovers,

282
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:10,931
I'm sure she would testify the truth for you.

283
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:15,431
I told you, didn't I?

284
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:18,431
That I was on the verge of a break up with my wife.

285
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,231
I was able to take it till just a while ago

286
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,031
and the way she used to get carried away

287
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:24,931
even if it was distasteful was cute.

288
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:30,031
But recently, she's really constantly been irritated,

289
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,031
saying things like, "I'm fatigued, tired or sleepy."

290
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:35,231
She neglected doing house chores

291
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:37,431
and threw up the food that I made.

292
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,931
These are all true.

293
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:45,031
But I did have my doubts about

294
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:48,031
whether to go through with this murder.

295
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:52,031
Until I heard those words come out of my wife's mouth...

296
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:55,031
Yes! I sent mail after mail to all the girls

297
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:57,031
that were sending you suspicious mails!

298
00:16:57,031 --> 00:16:59,431
"Die, you thief" I wrote!

299
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:07,631
I thought something was strange.

300
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:10,131
Because I completely stopped getting invitations from my friends

301
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:14,531
who used to ask me to go to the beach or mountains with them.

302
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:17,131
Even the woman subordinate at the company who mailed me

303
00:17:17,131 --> 00:17:19,031
saying she had something she wanted to discuss with me,

304
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:22,731
suddenly quit the company and I haven't heard from her since.

305
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:26,731
I was totally fed up already

306
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:29,831
of that woman who thought only about herself!

307
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:34,531
But, what a fool I am.

308
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:38,131
Despite having stabbed her, being that she's my wife,

309
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:41,431
I found myself praying that I don't want her to die!

310
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:44,331
Knowing that if she makes it through, it's all over for me.

311
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:48,031
Yeah, you're a fool.

312
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,831
Look!

313
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:54,131
This is the mail that your wife sent to your woman friends.

314
00:17:54,131 --> 00:17:57,031
What she really wrote.

315
00:17:57,031 --> 00:17:59,131
What she really wrote?

316
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:06,231
Thank you for always inviting my husband

317
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:08,031
to go to the beach and mountains.

318
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:13,031
Only, my husband's blood type is AB, RH minus,

319
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:17,531
so please take care that he doesn't hurt himself seriously.

320
00:18:24,131 --> 00:18:26,831
Thank you always for taking care of my husband.

321
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:29,131
If you have something to discuss with my husband,

322
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:32,031
why not come over to our home?

323
00:18:32,031 --> 00:18:33,131
Although I may not be of much help,

324
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:35,431
maybe as a woman who is older than you,

325
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:38,131
I could help in one way or another.

326
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:43,031
Sumika.

327
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:49,131
Your friends stopped inviting you to go to the beach and mountains

328
00:18:49,131 --> 00:18:51,731
because they were worried about your body.

329
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:56,031
The subordinate woman didn't discuss things over with you

330
00:18:56,031 --> 00:18:59,831
was because she had some ulterior motive, wasn't it?

331
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:03,631
Anything a woman could want to talk to you about without your wife knowing

332
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:06,231
wouldn't be anything good anyway.

333
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:09,731
Besides, you probably got it all wrong.

334
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,731
Got it all wrong?

335
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:14,131
Irritable, tires easily,

336
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:17,431
gets sleepy, fatigued, and nauseated...

337
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:20,631
These are all early signs of pregnancy!

338
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:22,531
What?

339
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:26,731
Your wife was probably lightly dressed because of this, too.

340
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:28,631
Since they are people who get feverish

341
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:32,931
due to the increase of the female hormone during pregnancy.

342
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:36,231
It seems that your wife doesn't know of this yet, though.

343
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:39,831
By the way,

344
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:43,531
I was watching your facial expression after the surgery

345
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:47,131
to decide whether you were really relieved that your wife was saved,

346
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:51,431
and whether you really regretted having stabbed her.

347
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:54,831
Well, as for me,

348
00:19:54,831 --> 00:20:01,131
no matter how relieved or apologetic you are,

349
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:04,331
I wouldn't be able to forgive you even a millimeter

350
00:20:04,331 --> 00:20:08,331
because I wouldn't want to make the baby who is about to be born,

351
00:20:08,331 --> 00:20:10,331
the child of a murder who was about to kill his wife

352
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:12,831
because of a stupid misunderstanding.

353
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:17,031
At any rate, for today, I'll explain it to the police

354
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:19,031
and deceive them in your favor,

355
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:20,631
so make sure that when your wife recovers,

356
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:22,431
you apologize to her from the bottom of your heart,

357
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:25,531
and talk over what you'd like to do in the future.

358
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:38,531
"Several days later" -Then, just as your husband...

359
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:41,131
and Conan had said, back at the time of the incident,

360
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:44,031
you, in order to stop your husband's hiccups,

361
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:46,531
flung up a knife in an attempt to shock him,

362
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:49,331
and got into a fight with your husband who thought you were serious,

363
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,631
and was stabbed instead?

364
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:55,731
Yes. I guess my acting looked very real.

365
00:20:55,731 --> 00:20:59,931
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused.

366
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:01,131
No problem.

367
00:21:01,131 --> 00:21:02,831
Well then, we'll take care of this case

368
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:05,031
by just giving you a strict warning, this time.

369
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:08,031
Please take care not to take things too far when fighting.

370
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:10,031
-Thank you very much. -Thank you very much.

371
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:12,631
Goodbye, then.

372
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:14,831
Thank you so much.

373
00:21:19,231 --> 00:21:23,631
Listen. Keep your word with me, okay?

374
00:21:23,631 --> 00:21:25,131
Yeah.

375
00:21:25,131 --> 00:21:26,831
No flirting!

376
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:29,931
Make sure you eat dinner at home!

377
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:31,331
I know.

378
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,831
And, if you ever do the same thing again,

379
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:37,431
I won't hesitate to counterattack.

380
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:39,731
So, keep that in mind.

381
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:43,431
Okay, Daddy?

382
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:47,731
Yep!

383
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:14,631
But, what a surprise! That lady...

384
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:18,431
Yeah! Who would've thought she was trying to stop hiccups!

385
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,531
But she's taking it too far, don't you think?

386
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:23,231
I guess so.

387
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:25,931
Isn't that the lady's husband?

388
00:23:32,031 --> 00:23:34,331
He's buying a lot of toys.

389
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:38,831
I don't think they know whether it's a boy or girl yet though.

390
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:40,531
Talk about a doting parent.

391
00:23:47,431 --> 00:23:50,631
I can't forgive even a millimeter yet, though.

392
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:52,131
Come on...

393
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:55,231
"Next Episode"

394
00:23:55,231 --> 00:23:57,531
-Are you Mr. Mouri? -What?

395
00:23:57,531 --> 00:23:59,931
I heard about you from Nagisa.

396
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:02,031
Okay! Shall we go then?

397
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:04,131
Don't!

398
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:06,331
An atmospheric depression is closing in.

399
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:10,031
Nagisa!

400
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,231
This is probably homicide.

401
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:15,231
But the only footprints around the corpse

402
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:18,431
are ours, who came running over.

403
00:24:18,431 --> 00:24:23,931
