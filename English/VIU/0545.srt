1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,500
Oh, no.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,700
The fog's getting thicker.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,100
True.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,600
I can virtually only slightly see the guardrail,

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,200
and I can't see the mountains in the distance or anything for that matter.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,000
It can't be helped.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,400
I saw on TV that at this time of the year,

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,500
Mt. Fyuna is enveloped in thick fog

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,300
because of something involving the temperature and humidity.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,100
TV again?

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,100
Study a little more.

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,500
He is!

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,800
Conan's tests all score 100!

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,100
Right?

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,300
Of course.

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,300
Because inside, I'm an 11th grader.

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,600
If I knew things were going to turn out this way,

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,200
we shouldn't have had dinner at the client's house.

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,600
I wasn't counting on spending the night there and leaving in the morning.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,100
It's because you drank too much and got drunk, isn't it, Dad?

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,500
Well, since you both got school today,

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,100
I'll get you home even if I have to speed back.

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,200
Speed... speed through this fog?

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,800
Don't worry.

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,300
There's nobody driving through a fog like this,

26
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,200
so there's no worry of on-coming traffic either.

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,300
But I don't think you should speed.

28
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,300
See, over there!

29
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,000
What? A checkpoint?

30
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,700
Your license, please.

31
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,000
Is anything wrong?

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,600
Okay...

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,800
You can let male drivers through.

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,300
Because after all, we're trying arrest...

35
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,300
a witch!

36
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,400
Yes, sir.

37
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,300
You're Yamamura of the Gunma Prefectural Police Department!

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,800
It's you, Mr. Mouri!

39
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
It's been such a long hula-hula time!

40
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Come off that hula-hula stuff.

41
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,800
What brings you to a place like this, Officer Yamamura?

42
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,100
Come on. Did you forget, Ran?

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,200
I'm no longer an ordinary officer.

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,500
I'm an inspector!

45
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,600
Please call me Inspector Yamamura!

46
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,300
Are they going to be okay? The Gunma Prefectural Police.

47
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,300
And? Was there a homicide or something, Detective Yamamura?

48
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,600
Inspector Yamamura.

49
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,900
In fact, I have a very important duty to carry out!

50
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,900
Important duty?

51
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,700
I'm on a witch hunt,

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,500
hunting for a witch!

53
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,100
Witch... witch hunt?

54
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,700
Witch?

55
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,000
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,700
Saturday nights are for mystery.

57
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,200
What is the true identity of the eerie woman

58
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,600
who appears in the foggy ridge?

59
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,300
He sees through the one and only truth.

60
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,200
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

61
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,300
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

62
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:38,792
"Witch Enshrouded by Fog (Part 1)".

63
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:43,892
Just what do you mean by witch hunt?

64
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:46,292
Haven't you ever heard about it, Mr. Mouri?

65
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:47,592
About the legendary woman driver

66
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:49,792
that was boisterously going around here

67
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:52,192
in Mt. Fuyuna about four years ago.

68
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,792
Legendary woman driver?

69
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:58,192
You know that this place is the Holy Land for street racers, don't you?

70
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:00,792
It's said that just as the street racers finished their race

71
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:01,992
and were starting to head home,

72
00:05:01,992 --> 00:05:04,692
she suddenly appeared from within the fog

73
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:07,292
and outraced all of them.

74
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:09,092
Together with the unique sound of the exhaust

75
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:12,292
and tires rubbing against the road,

76
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:16,792
they say it really sounded like a woman was closing in while screaming.

77
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:21,292
She was therefore, nicknamed The Silver-white Witch of Mt. Fuyuna!

78
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,392
Silver-white Witch?

79
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:26,492
Why Silver-white?

80
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:31,092
It seems it was because the car that the witch was driving was a white FD.

81
00:05:31,092 --> 00:05:34,792
But how can people tell that she was a woman?

82
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,292
Could they see her?

83
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:39,892
There was car that spun when battling with her car.

84
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:41,692
At that time, she came out of her car

85
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:44,192
and asked the driver, "Are you all right?"

86
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:46,792
It's said that she was a super beauty!

87
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:53,992
And? Why are you trying to arrest her?

88
00:05:53,992 --> 00:05:57,992
Well, the witch recently appeared again

89
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:02,792
challenging the street racers, causing a series of car accidents.

90
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:03,892
The other day,

91
00:06:03,892 --> 00:06:05,292
a racer crashed through the guardrail,

92
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:07,992
fell over and is in critical condition now.

93
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,492
Hold on!

94
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:13,092
Why are investigators from the crime unit handling this?

95
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:15,592
Traffic accident should be handled by the traffic department.

96
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:19,892
I encountered that witch too!

97
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:21,792
No joke?

98
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,592
I was asked by one of my superiors to go get the car

99
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,592
that he used to stake out with.

100
00:06:26,592 --> 00:06:28,192
When I was driving the car,

101
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:32,392
the witch's car came out of the fog!

102
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,692
How did you know she was a witch?

103
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:36,192
Her hand.

104
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:40,092
The hand that came out of the car was so witchy.

105
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:44,092
Witchy? Weren't you driving the car?

106
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:46,392
Well, to be exact,

107
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:48,192
it was my grandmother.

108
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:50,192
She came out from the country

109
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:52,792
and I went to pick her up at the station with the car.

110
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,692
Then she told me that she'd drive for me,

111
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:56,392
since I'm tired from work,

112
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:58,892
so to go to sleep in the passenger's seat.

113
00:06:58,892 --> 00:07:00,292
And?

114
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:04,092
Don't tell me that your granny battled with that witch.

115
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,792
Of course, she went all out!

116
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:10,892
Granny loves the F-1 races and car chase movies!

117
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:13,892
But she gave up part way.

118
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,392
Her opponent is superhuman.

119
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:17,092
She said she didn't stand a chance.

120
00:07:17,092 --> 00:07:18,692
Super human?

121
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:21,892
Yes, that's what granny said.

122
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:24,092
She said that car, like a superhuman,

123
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:29,092
sped over the fog where there was no street.

124
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:31,492
Over... over the fog?

125
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,892
Yes. Granny said she thought it strange,

126
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:35,892
stopped the car and got out.

127
00:07:35,892 --> 00:07:39,592
That person also got off the car and was standing on the fog.

128
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,592
When granny waved her hand,

129
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:44,492
she said that the woman also waved back.

130
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:48,092
Do you expect us to believe a story like that?

131
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,692
I guess not.

132
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:52,892
That's why after I'm finished with the work of the first precinct,

133
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:58,592
I'm helping out at this checkpoint over here, you see.

134
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:04,492
Well, it seems she only appears early in the morning when the fog is thick,

135
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:07,992
so I do this only on my days off.

136
00:08:07,992 --> 00:08:10,392
My next day off is...

137
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:12,192
next Saturday.

138
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:15,192
Would you like me to help you too?

139
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:18,792
It's okay! Because granny could've seen wrong.

140
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:20,392
And no matter how famed a detective you are,

141
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:24,092
you could probably never catch a witch that walks on fog, right?

142
00:08:24,092 --> 00:08:27,492
Maybe she'll come again to see me

143
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:31,592
because I've got a pure heart.

144
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:33,292
Is that so?

145
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:36,892
The Silver-white Witch of Fuyuna Pass?

146
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,492
I know! I know!

147
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:41,292
I heard that she recently appeared again,

148
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:43,792
but what about her, Ran?

149
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:44,992
The fact is.

150
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:49,192
Dad is all out to catch the witch.

151
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:52,092
A white FD! FD!

152
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:55,792
He's calling all his friends who are driving,

153
00:08:55,792 --> 00:09:02,092
but all he knows is that the driver is a woman driving a white FD.

154
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:03,592
I thought that maybe since you're in the transportation division,

155
00:09:03,592 --> 00:09:06,992
you might know something more, Yumi.

156
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:12,392
My jurisdiction is Tokyo, so...

157
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:14,592
Do you know anything, Miwako?

158
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:18,592
A woman street racer who rides a white FD.

159
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:21,392
I'm not too keen with cars, so...

160
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:24,292
The car I'm riding now is a hand-me-down of my father's too.

161
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:25,992
I thought so.

162
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:27,792
I'm sorry, Ran,

163
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:29,592
that I'm of no help.

164
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:32,192
FD... I wonder if it's a foreign car?

165
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:39,592
Hey, Dad, let's go home already.

166
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:41,792
We've made two round trips already.

167
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:43,292
You idiot!

168
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:47,592
I rented a Lancer Evolution, just to hunt the witch!

169
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:49,692
I can't quit now!

170
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:52,892
But, if she's really a witch, I'm scared.

171
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,592
I told you not to come along, didn't I?

172
00:09:55,592 --> 00:09:57,492
But Conan...

173
00:09:57,492 --> 00:10:00,692
I wanted to see the witch!

174
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:03,692
Today is Saturday, so there's no school either.

175
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:05,392
But since she's not appearing

176
00:10:05,392 --> 00:10:07,092
even if we're running around like this,

177
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:09,492
maybe she's taking time off too.

178
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:11,792
Darn, I guess there's nothing that can be done.

179
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,092
Let's head on home.

180
00:10:14,092 --> 00:10:17,092
Come on, Ran, what's with that weird voice?

181
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:19,892
I'm not speeding all that much.

182
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:22,692
It's not me! I didn't say anything.

183
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:25,992
Is it the sound of tires?

184
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,292
Tires rubbing against the ground that sound like a woman's scream.

185
00:10:31,592 --> 00:10:35,792
Besides, response that seems to bust out at once to the red zone.

186
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,892
A unique sound of the engine

187
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:40,092
that sounds like the shrill voice of a woman.

188
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:41,092
Don't tell me that...

189
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:43,392
Hey, Ran! Look behind!

190
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,392
-Is something coming? -Behind?

191
00:10:46,392 --> 00:10:48,192
No.

192
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:52,192
Pops, beside you, beside you.

193
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:01,092
It... it's coming!

194
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:02,392
The white FD!

195
00:11:06,992 --> 00:11:08,792
Sign of battle?

196
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,292
Just great!

197
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:12,392
Wanna have it out with me?

198
00:11:12,392 --> 00:11:14,592
No, Dad, don't!

199
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:15,692
Shut up!

200
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:18,992
I'm not going to cop out from somebody picking a fight with me!

201
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:27,992
I'll take you on!

202
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:42,392
She's already so far away.

203
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:43,592
Darn!

204
00:11:43,592 --> 00:11:45,092
Another curve!

205
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:46,492
You're not getting away!

206
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,992
Pops! Stop! The brakes! Quick!

207
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:01,592
Stop.

208
00:12:13,992 --> 00:12:15,692
Just what do you think you're doing?

209
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:18,492
Pops, which way were thinking of turning just now?

210
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:20,292
Left, you hear left!

211
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:22,892
Because that car turned left.

212
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:25,392
But Pops,

213
00:12:25,392 --> 00:12:28,092
there's no road to the left.

214
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:30,392
What?

215
00:12:30,392 --> 00:12:32,992
Don't... don't be ridiculous!

216
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:35,092
I'm sure that the car went left.

217
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:38,892
What the hell's going on?

218
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:45,592
A witch that speeds over the fog of Fuyuna Pass.

219
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:47,792
Very interesting!

220
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:55,292
Really?

221
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:57,687
Maybe you saw wrong, Dad?

222
00:12:57,687 --> 00:12:59,287
No, I didn't see wrong.

223
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:01,887
The white FD turned left

224
00:13:01,887 --> 00:13:04,287
and sped over the fog.

225
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:07,687
The red tail lights of that car tilted for a second.

226
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,887
I saw it turn the left curve with my very eyes.

227
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:12,987
I didn't see wrong!

228
00:13:12,987 --> 00:13:14,487
I saw it too.

229
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:16,787
I heard the sound of the tires at the curve too.

230
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:19,887
The guardrail was closing in in a strange way,

231
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:22,787
so I pulled the side brakes and stopped the car but...

232
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:25,387
Then, it's the witch after all!

233
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,287
She was probably using some kind of frightening witchcraft

234
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:28,787
to ride above the fog,

235
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:32,287
and lured us so that our car would get into an accident!

236
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,887
Inspector Yamamura's grandmother

237
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:37,987
seems to have seen that person stand on the fog too.

238
00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:39,587
The hand that came out of that car

239
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:42,687
was really witchy and felt eerie.

240
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:44,187
Maybe it's true

241
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:47,887
that the car is something we humans shouldn't be meddling with.

242
00:13:47,887 --> 00:13:49,187
Two people.

243
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:52,987
There were two people inside that car, weren't there?

244
00:13:52,987 --> 00:13:57,187
You... you mean you saw inside the car?

245
00:13:57,187 --> 00:13:59,887
I couldn't but you can tell, can't you?

246
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:02,987
That FD is a Japanese car, but the steering wheel is on the left.

247
00:14:02,987 --> 00:14:06,887
The driver couldn't possibly stick his arm out the passenger's seat, right?

248
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:10,987
But if she's a witch, she could stretch her arm.

249
00:14:10,987 --> 00:14:15,787
Then, why don't you ask him, Inspector Yamamura, to check it out?

250
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:19,387
Why do you have to bring out the name of that klutz?

251
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:20,987
Because he said he was going to be

252
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:23,487
at this checkpoint again this Saturday, right?

253
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,587
If you call him right away,

254
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:26,987
he may be able to stop that car, right?

255
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:28,587
True.

256
00:14:28,587 --> 00:14:30,787
The model is a FD and the color is white.

257
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,587
If more than two people are riding,

258
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:34,587
the targets narrowed down quite a bit.

259
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:36,387
Let's not!

260
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:37,787
If we go after her

261
00:14:37,787 --> 00:14:39,487
and she casts a spell on us or something,

262
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:40,587
what are you going to do?

263
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:42,387
Don't worry!

264
00:14:42,387 --> 00:14:44,887
Speeding the car over the fog

265
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:46,887
and standing on the fog

266
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,887
are both things that can be proven logically.

267
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:52,887
The only place that witches and curses exist in this world

268
00:14:52,887 --> 00:14:55,387
are only in fantasy stories.

269
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,287
Conan.

270
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:02,987
I mean, I'm sure Shinichi would say something like that.

271
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,287
I guess so.

272
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:10,087
Stop the white FD that has more than two people riding in it?

273
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:14,287
We are checking every white FD that we see.

274
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:17,287
But since none look suspicious, we're letting them through.

275
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:18,987
Letting them through?

276
00:15:18,987 --> 00:15:21,287
You mean you saw a white FD?

277
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,887
Yes, about five of them.

278
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:24,987
What? Five?

279
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:28,987
All of them seem to like the Silver-white Witch.

280
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:32,787
White FDs seem to be very popular now.

281
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:34,087
But, don't worry.

282
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:36,287
We only let the male drivers through,

283
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:38,687
and no women have come by yet.

284
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,887
You idiot!

285
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:41,987
Stop the men too!

286
00:15:41,987 --> 00:15:45,487
The woman that got off the witch's car four years ago,

287
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:49,487
may have just happened to be riding the car!

288
00:15:49,487 --> 00:15:54,187
Anyway, stop all the white FDs that come by until I get there!

289
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,787
Judging from the location of that checkpoint,

290
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:58,887
I'm sure that the witch hasn't passed by yet!

291
00:15:58,887 --> 00:15:59,887
Okay.

292
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:02,587
"Checkpoint."

293
00:16:04,587 --> 00:16:06,387
So these three are the three white FDs

294
00:16:06,387 --> 00:16:10,387
that got stopped at the checkpoint after I called?

295
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,587
Yes, all three had two people inside.

296
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:16,187
Well, I'm sure that the last car that was stopped at the checkpoint

297
00:16:16,187 --> 00:16:18,387
is the witch's car.

298
00:16:18,387 --> 00:16:21,987
I haven't overtaken any other cars.

299
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:25,087
But I don't think the order they came in is reliable.

300
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,287
The only car that came directly here

301
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:29,587
without stopping over anywhere is this car.

302
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:32,787
The other two cars stopped over partway

303
00:16:32,787 --> 00:16:35,687
and were overtaken by several cars.

304
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:36,787
Come to think of it,

305
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:40,087
several cars went by

306
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:42,087
when Dad was on the phone with Inspector Yamamura.

307
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:44,087
Which means, we can't tell

308
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,587
whether the FD is the witch's judging just by the order in which they came.

309
00:16:47,587 --> 00:16:50,187
Well, I did try asking,

310
00:16:50,187 --> 00:16:52,987
but there seems to be no witch among them.

311
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:54,987
What did you ask?

312
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:58,387
Of course, I asked, "Are you a witch?"

313
00:16:58,387 --> 00:17:00,587
What a dope.

314
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:04,087
Why don't you ask them too, Pops?

315
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:06,787
After all, we did see the witch's hand.

316
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:09,287
Yeah, true.

317
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:11,187
And? Who came first?

318
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:13,787
That FD with two men inside.

319
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:15,387
"Raito Egashira (25)" -How rude!

320
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:17,487
We're telling you we're not warlocks!

321
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,787
"Akira Mafune (26)" -Well, it's true that we're riding a white FD

322
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:23,387
thanks to her, though.

323
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:26,787
Speeding through this pass is easy when riding this FD, so...

324
00:17:26,787 --> 00:17:28,387
Speeding through is easy?

325
00:17:28,387 --> 00:17:32,287
Because the mediocre street racers all panic and make way for us.

326
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:33,887
Excuse me.

327
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:37,087
Were you guys going fishing?

328
00:17:37,087 --> 00:17:40,687
See! The things in the backseat, aren't they fishing equipment?

329
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:44,987
Yeah, because we get to fish for black bass in Lake Fuyuna.

330
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:48,587
Will you show me that rod?

331
00:17:48,587 --> 00:17:51,487
Okay, but don't break it,

332
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,487
because it's a good rod.

333
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:54,487
Here.

334
00:17:57,687 --> 00:18:00,887
It sure is a good rod.

335
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:02,987
And? Is it really true

336
00:18:02,987 --> 00:18:06,487
that you didn't overtake anyone until you came here?

337
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:10,087
Yeah, because he was at the wheels today.

338
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:13,987
He may not look it, but he's a safe driver.

339
00:18:13,987 --> 00:18:15,287
Shut up.

340
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:16,987
Hey.

341
00:18:16,987 --> 00:18:19,787
You're sure wearing some ring.

342
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:23,887
Yeah. Thanks to it, when I tried to fasten my seatbelt, it got stuck

343
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:26,187
and I'm still bleeding.

344
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:27,287
Come to think of it,

345
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:29,987
I think the witch was also wearing a ring like this.

346
00:18:29,987 --> 00:18:31,187
Really?

347
00:18:33,287 --> 00:18:36,087
The reason I'm driving a white FD?

348
00:18:36,087 --> 00:18:39,287
"Rumi Hando (23)" -Why else? Because I adore the witch!

349
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:41,687
"Haruka Kawai (24)" -She's charismatic, that's why!

350
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:45,887
And? It seems that somebody overtook you on your way here?

351
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,787
Yeah, I got a call while I was driving,

352
00:18:49,787 --> 00:18:51,087
so I pulled over to the side.

353
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:53,387
And that's when two to three cars overtook me.

354
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:56,287
Were they white FDs?

355
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:58,687
Well, I don't remember.

356
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,787
There was a thick fog too.

357
00:19:00,787 --> 00:19:04,387
Was that call by any chance from one of your golfing friends?

358
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:05,387
Yeah.

359
00:19:05,387 --> 00:19:07,187
Who's this boy?

360
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,087
Because there are three golf bags inside.

361
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:11,787
That's why I thought so.

362
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:13,887
I'm asking you, who's he?

363
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,587
Well, this boy is...

364
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:19,687
Huh, what happened to your fake nail?

365
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:22,187
Your middle fingernail is gone.

366
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,587
When I shifted gears a while ago,

367
00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:27,187
it got stuck and disappeared.

368
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:30,187
Come to think of it, the nails of a witch are also long.

369
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:32,887
Look closely!

370
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:34,787
Haruka's is pink!

371
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:36,987
Don't witches have black nails?

372
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:41,887
By the way, is it okay to check inside your golf bags?

373
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:44,587
Yes, go ahead.

374
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:49,387
"Jinya Enda (31)" -You mean the witch that frequently appears here

375
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:51,687
is riding a white FD?

376
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:53,487
"Yasue Taira (28)" -I didn't know.

377
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:55,587
I'm just driving this because I like the color white,

378
00:19:55,587 --> 00:19:59,087
as well as the wave-like design.

379
00:19:59,087 --> 00:20:03,187
Were you overtaken by another white FD?

380
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:04,887
Out of all the three FDs,

381
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:08,287
yours was checked the last, right?

382
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:13,887
Yes, I was buying canned coffee along the way, when I was overtaken,

383
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:15,287
but I don't remember what model car it was.

384
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:17,487
While drinking coffee in the car,

385
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:21,887
we were all talking excitedly about Lakeside Park where we were headed.

386
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,087
That's why you brought along floats and rubber boats?

387
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:26,387
Right.

388
00:20:26,387 --> 00:20:30,587
We can use boats, go rafting and play at the pool there, you see.

389
00:20:30,587 --> 00:20:33,887
But if you bloat it up like this in the car,

390
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:35,387
you can't get it out, can you?

391
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:37,887
She told me so just a while ago too.

392
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:40,587
She said for me to put air in it after we reached our destination.

393
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:43,687
Which means that you were the one driving, miss?

394
00:20:43,687 --> 00:20:45,087
Yes.

395
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:46,287
I was sitting in the passenger's seat

396
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,487
and navigating her while looking at the map.

397
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:51,287
What the...

398
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:53,887
A little too plum for a witch.

399
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:58,387
Well, we'd like to check your rubber boat and float for now then.

400
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:00,887
Hey, Misao.

401
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:02,387
Granny!

402
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:05,487
"Misae Yamamura, Yamamura's Grandmother" -I told you to stay in the car.

403
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:08,187
You... you brought your grandmother along?

404
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:09,187
Yes.

405
00:21:09,187 --> 00:21:11,487
She wouldn't listen to me saying that

406
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:14,587
she would be able to recognize the witch she saw back then.

407
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:18,087
Well, she isn't in there.

408
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:20,687
How do you know that she's not there?

409
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:22,987
Well, because back then,

410
00:21:22,987 --> 00:21:28,587
the one who got off the car on top of the fog and waved back at me

411
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,887
had a halo around her.

412
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:34,687
She looked more like a goddess than a witch to me.

413
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:38,387
They don't have halos around them, do they?

414
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:40,287
What's with that old lady?

415
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:42,087
Granny!

416
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:46,187
I... I guess you can leave for today.

417
00:21:46,187 --> 00:21:47,787
If we need anything more,

418
00:21:47,787 --> 00:21:49,887
we'll call you from the station.

419
00:21:50,987 --> 00:21:53,387
Silver-white Witch.

420
00:21:53,387 --> 00:21:55,487
The legendary witch driver who street raced

421
00:21:55,487 --> 00:21:57,687
all over Mt. Fuyuna four years ago.

422
00:21:58,787 --> 00:22:01,587
Driving on the fog.

423
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,887
Standing on the fog and waving her hand.

424
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:08,587
What kind of trick did she use anyway?

425
00:22:08,587 --> 00:22:11,187
Can somebody really do something like that?

426
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:15,587
There are three pairs of suspicious drivers.

427
00:22:15,587 --> 00:22:19,787
Mr. Raito Egashira and Akira Mabune.

428
00:22:19,787 --> 00:22:23,587
Ms. Rumi Hando and Ms. Haruka Kawai.

429
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:27,687
Mr. Jinya Enda and Ms. Yasue Taira.

430
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:30,487
Just wait and see, Silver-white Witch.

431
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:34,487
I'll disclose your true identity for sure!

432
00:23:56,287 --> 00:23:57,387
"Next Episode" -You idiot!

433
00:23:57,387 --> 00:23:59,387
The ending song for today's drama

434
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:03,887
is "Midnight Mirage" sung by Yoko Okino!

435
00:24:03,887 --> 00:24:05,887
Mirage?

436
00:24:05,887 --> 00:24:08,787
I thought of a simple trick like that too,

437
00:24:08,787 --> 00:24:10,987
but that doesn't explain what's going on!

438
00:24:10,987 --> 00:24:13,487
Standing on top of the fog, that is!

439
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:16,887
Then, why don't we ask the one who's doing it to solve the mystery?

440
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:18,787
The Silver-white Witch!

441
00:24:20,687 --> 00:24:21,887
Next Conan,

442
00:24:21,887 --> 00:24:24,987
"Witch Enshrouded by Fog (Part 2)".

443
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,350
Next Conan's Hint:

444
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,350
"Mirage".

445
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,350
Shinichi is over there!

446
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,950
That's only a mirage!

447
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,950
Because you see, I'm right here.
