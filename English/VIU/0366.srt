1
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:22,788
The stage for today's episode is fishing.

2
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,588
A breakwater out at sea in clear view

3
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,388
but a murder is committed without anyone noticing.

4
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:27,988
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:29,688
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:31,889
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54,964 --> 00:01:58,364
Here. Watch your step, all of you.

8
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:11,563
The wind feels so good!

9
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,063
Listen, all of you!

10
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:16,163
We're going fishing out by the breakwater!

11
00:02:16,164 --> 00:02:18,463
Be careful not to get too carried away

12
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:19,963
and fall into the ocean, all right?

13
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:21,264
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

14
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:27,363
How unusual to go out fishing to the sea.

15
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:29,563
Oh, yeah.

16
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:30,963
What's the problem?

17
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:32,063
Every time we decide to go somewhere,

18
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,263
it's always camping at the mountains,

19
00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:36,163
so I'm sure that Dr. Agasa wanted us to experience something new!

20
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:38,064
Well... Sort of...

21
00:02:39,264 --> 00:02:41,563
I'm not complaining or anything.

22
00:02:41,564 --> 00:02:43,163
I already have a hunch that

23
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:46,263
since I've been avoiding going out to distant places with you guys,

24
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:47,963
you figured instead of taking me to the confinement of the mountains,

25
00:02:47,964 --> 00:02:51,063
it would be better to take me out to see where the view is nice and clear.

26
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:53,163
Thanks to somebody's great idea, right?

27
00:02:53,164 --> 00:02:54,264
Darn you.

28
00:02:55,864 --> 00:02:57,263
-She hit the bull's eye. -She hit the bull's eye.

29
00:02:57,264 --> 00:03:00,363
I guess it's not a bad idea for a change of scene

30
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:02,063
to come and feel the sea breeze of this vast ocean,

31
00:03:02,064 --> 00:03:04,664
the mother of all creation.

32
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:08,963
But I think he should've just minded his own business.

33
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:11,263
What a snob!

34
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:12,863
Well... Regardless of her remarks,

35
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:16,163
I can tell that Ai is pretty happy about this.

36
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:17,663
You think so?

37
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:21,763
And, like she says, the ocean is the source of life.

38
00:03:21,764 --> 00:03:24,063
The source of life?

39
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:26,964
Besides, it's a great place to relax.

40
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:30,963
Come to think of it, today is...

41
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:34,263
Oh, my... Are you all going to fish at the breakwater too?

42
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:35,763
Yes! We are.

43
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:37,863
Only until after noon, though!

44
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:39,563
Then, would you like to have a bet with me

45
00:03:39,564 --> 00:03:42,363
and see how many fish we can catch by then?

46
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:43,663
A bet to see...

47
00:03:43,664 --> 00:03:45,163
How many fish we can catch?

48
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:48,263
Let's bet one side dish from our lunch box!

49
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:50,363
"Kiriko Shirane (38)" -Lunch box? One side dish?

50
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,663
I'll bet my crab cream croquette.

51
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:54,463
It is very delicious!

52
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:56,163
Right, Kanetani?

53
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:57,263
Yeah.

54
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:59,563
"Mineto Kanetani (39)" -It's always great.

55
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:01,663
Just as expected of a fisherman's daughter.

56
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:05,063
You're tops when it comes to making dishes using seafood.

57
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:09,463
We're all lucky we get to eat the food that this beauty makes, you know?

58
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:11,463
Oh, cut it out, Kanetani.

59
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:14,263
But, we're only beginners.

60
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:16,863
You should have Ida give you advice then.

61
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:18,263
Ida?

62
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:22,163
He's the one who's navigating this ship right now.

63
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:23,563
A fisherman actively in business!

64
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,864
He's a super veteran that knows everything about fishing!

65
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:29,263
No way, no can do.

66
00:04:29,264 --> 00:04:30,663
"Futoshi Ejiri (41)" -No matter how much advice you get,

67
00:04:30,664 --> 00:04:31,963
you won't be able to fish anything.

68
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:34,363
Because you're "bozu" (no catch) to begin with

69
00:04:34,364 --> 00:04:37,463
be it your brains or your age, you get it?

70
00:04:37,464 --> 00:04:40,863
"Bozu" (No catch)?

71
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,563
I wonder if brains or age has anything to do with fishing?

72
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:48,563
He's just joking and saying that you won't catch any fish.

73
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:50,563
It's a pun, a play on words.

74
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:54,663
No need to trouble yourself over it, it's just an old man's joke.

75
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:57,463
That guy... Okay!

76
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,363
Let's ask the fisherman all kinds of questions

77
00:04:59,364 --> 00:05:02,764
and fish up a lot of yellow tails and tunas!

78
00:05:03,964 --> 00:05:06,164
You can't fish something that big.

79
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:13,964
"Tragedy of the Conspicuous Pier (Part 1)"

80
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:16,663
Okay, I'll see you guys then.

81
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:19,263
I'll be back in three hours. Good luck.

82
00:05:19,264 --> 00:05:22,263
"Iwao Ida (39)" -If something comes up call me right away, okay?

83
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:24,264
I'll come for you in 20 minutes!

84
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:35,263
What's the matter? Why are you doing that?

85
00:05:35,264 --> 00:05:36,663
Because...

86
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:38,063
-Right? -Yes!

87
00:05:38,064 --> 00:05:41,663
We went to ask him about fishing...

88
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:44,763
But he treated us too much like little kids

89
00:05:44,764 --> 00:05:46,463
that we really got angry!

90
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:48,763
And, what did he say?

91
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:53,464
He said don't make loud noises with your friends.

92
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:56,663
That's right.

93
00:05:56,664 --> 00:05:59,663
It's exactly as the fisherman says.

94
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:01,563
Why is he right?

95
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:02,963
If loud noises are made,

96
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:05,263
the sound of footsteps and such

97
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,163
will travel along the breakwater into the water,

98
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:10,363
surprising the fish and make them flee.

99
00:06:10,364 --> 00:06:12,363
So, that fisherman was probably trying to tell you

100
00:06:12,364 --> 00:06:14,363
that if you make too much noise your footsteps,

101
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:17,363
it will keep the fish away.

102
00:06:17,364 --> 00:06:20,663
But he didn't have to say it that tone of voice!

103
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:23,063
Exactly! That's right!

104
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:25,063
Did he say anything else?

105
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:26,264
Well...

106
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:34,663
It's dangerous doing something like that.

107
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:35,963
What if the children copy him?

108
00:06:35,964 --> 00:06:37,663
It will be bad.

109
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,563
The place over there, where the tetra pods are,

110
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:42,563
is Ejiri's usual fishing spot!

111
00:06:42,564 --> 00:06:47,063
That man is not contented unless he gets to fish there.

112
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:48,563
But it's strange that

113
00:06:48,564 --> 00:06:50,663
the tetra pod looks to be above the surface of the water.

114
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:52,463
Although it's so out off shore like this,

115
00:06:52,464 --> 00:06:54,963
it's pretty shallow, isn't it?

116
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:56,663
Yes.

117
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:59,663
The rocks here a patterned in complex fashion.

118
00:06:59,664 --> 00:07:02,163
That area over there is very deep, you see.

119
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:03,263
Well, but thanks to that,

120
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:04,963
this place is hard to enter for fishing,

121
00:07:04,964 --> 00:07:08,963
that not too many people know of this place.

122
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:11,863
So, this is an extremely fantastic hidden fishing spot,

123
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,563
thanks to Ida's navigating skill.

124
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:18,464
I see, that's why there aren't other fishers around.

125
00:07:19,464 --> 00:07:20,963
Let's give it our best shot.

126
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:23,064
After all, our lunch is at stake too.

127
00:07:25,964 --> 00:07:29,963
But are you sure we can catch fish in a place like this?

128
00:07:29,964 --> 00:07:32,663
Yeah. For fish, the breakwater is like

129
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:36,863
an artificially made hotel with a restaurant.

130
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:38,963
There'll be loads of fish!

131
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:40,163
Really?

132
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:41,763
There're lots of them?

133
00:07:41,764 --> 00:07:44,163
But the fishing season is already...

134
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,164
Oh, no!

135
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,763
-a bit over... -This cooler box is so small!

136
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:49,963
What should we do?

137
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:52,063
We didn't figure things out too well.

138
00:07:52,064 --> 00:07:54,063
What if we can't fit all the fish in?

139
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:55,763
Don't worry.

140
00:07:55,764 --> 00:07:58,663
I'll eat them all up.

141
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:02,363
-What a thing to say, Genta, come off it! -Excuse me...

142
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:05,163
I'll aim for the record of youngest big catcher then.

143
00:08:05,164 --> 00:08:07,263
Oh, just great.

144
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:09,963
I'll open up a fish shop then!

145
00:08:09,964 --> 00:08:12,563
Yep... That's good idea.

146
00:08:12,564 --> 00:08:15,064
You're not listening at all, you guys.

147
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:33,663
No fish at all.

148
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:35,963
I wonder if the fish are asleep?

149
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:38,463
Yeah, it's not even budging.

150
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:40,263
And it's such a clear day.

151
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:42,463
The fish don't bite because it's a clear day.

152
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:44,263
What do you mean?

153
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:46,063
It's not good if it's a fine day?

154
00:08:46,064 --> 00:08:49,463
No, because the water is only this deep.

155
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:51,663
On a fine day when the water is transparent,

156
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,063
fish get suspicious and are on guard.

157
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:56,063
So it's actually better

158
00:08:56,064 --> 00:08:59,464
if it were cloudy or drizzling a little.

159
00:09:00,564 --> 00:09:02,563
Nevertheless, this is a good place.

160
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:04,563
So the fish will eventually start biting.

161
00:09:04,564 --> 00:09:06,864
Well... I'd advise you not to get your hopes up too high.

162
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,263
What it all boils down to is

163
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:11,563
only people with patience are suited for fishing.

164
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:13,063
That's not true!

165
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:16,463
There are impatient people among fishing experts.

166
00:09:16,464 --> 00:09:19,263
Exactly, impatient people are said to be suited for fishing

167
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:22,163
because they're concerned whether the bait's not too good,

168
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:24,363
whether where they are fishing is not good,

169
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,063
whether their tools aren't good enough.

170
00:09:27,064 --> 00:09:28,863
So, they read up on fishing books,

171
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:30,663
take notice of fishing news,

172
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:33,163
check out the tides of the day and so forth.

173
00:09:33,164 --> 00:09:35,263
They do a lot of research as well as try each and every kind of thing,

174
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:38,163
so impatient people are said to become good anglers faster.

175
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:41,763
Well, to become a good angler, experience is what counts!

176
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:43,763
The more effort you put in,

177
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:44,863
the more reward you get to receive from the sea.

178
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:47,963
That is you get to catch better fish too.

179
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:49,163
Well as for me,

180
00:09:49,164 --> 00:09:53,264
I haven't received such a great gift from the ocean yet though.

181
00:09:55,264 --> 00:09:56,264
Hey, Conan.

182
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:59,563
You said there are many different kinds of fish here, right?

183
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:00,663
Yeah.

184
00:10:00,664 --> 00:10:02,663
Then can we catch sea bream here too?

185
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:03,763
That's impossible.

186
00:10:03,764 --> 00:10:06,963
Why not? Why is it impossible?

187
00:10:06,964 --> 00:10:08,063
There are no sea breams

188
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:11,663
unless you go to a place that's more out to the sea

189
00:10:11,664 --> 00:10:13,563
with a depth of 30 to 70 meters.

190
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:16,363
But since the sea is connected,

191
00:10:16,364 --> 00:10:19,563
a sea bream may go astray and come along, right?

192
00:10:19,564 --> 00:10:22,464
Remember! There was a sea lion that did that too, right?

193
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:28,063
Yeah, all we have to do is catch fish that come swimming astray.

194
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:30,863
Even whales come swimming astray at times too.

195
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:31,864
Come on...

196
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:35,163
I guess we can't fish for whales though...

197
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:37,363
Well, we've got lots of time,

198
00:10:37,364 --> 00:10:39,063
so I guess we'll just have to stick it out, right, Conan?

199
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:41,464
Oh, yeah, let's do our best.

200
00:10:43,564 --> 00:10:44,663
Did you catch something?

201
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:46,063
Oh, no...

202
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:48,763
My bobber drifted away.

203
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:52,163
Gosh. It's because you didn't push it in nicely into the bobber rubber.

204
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:53,963
But...

205
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:55,463
What is it now?

206
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:58,364
Look, Ai's bobber is moving!

207
00:11:00,564 --> 00:11:01,863
Caught a fish!

208
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:03,463
Keep your cool, Haibara!

209
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:04,863
Pull! Pull!

210
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,963
-Just a little more! -Hang in there!

211
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:08,063
Don't rush!

212
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:10,064
That's right, you're doing good!

213
00:11:16,064 --> 00:11:17,664
-She did it! -She did it!

214
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:27,263
It sure is tiny, though.

215
00:11:27,264 --> 00:11:29,563
A tiny girella?

216
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,964
Well, I guess it's better than nothing.

217
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:35,563
What do you think you're doing?

218
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:38,663
It's fishing manners to return trash fish into the sea, isn't it?

219
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:39,963
I guess you're right.

220
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:41,763
What a waste.

221
00:11:41,764 --> 00:11:43,963
But the next time you put the fish back into the sea,

222
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:45,663
it's better to cool your hands with the water in the bucket

223
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,264
before throwing in the fish.

224
00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:52,263
Because the body temperature of humans is too warm for the fish

225
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:54,164
and it would get burned!

226
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:58,163
You sure like to pick on people, don't you?

227
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:02,463
I just said that it would be better to do so!

228
00:12:02,464 --> 00:12:06,363
But now we know that we can fish here too!

229
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:09,663
I'm going to change places and go fish over on that side.

230
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:10,664
Hey!

231
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:12,163
I want to fish for sea bream!

232
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,363
Don't run!

233
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:15,763
Oh, right. Sea bream...

234
00:12:15,764 --> 00:12:17,964
I've told you, it's impossible.

235
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:34,968
Talk about not being able to fish anything.

236
00:12:34,969 --> 00:12:37,068
You can say that again.

237
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:38,168
Who was it that was saying

238
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:40,969
let's fish for yellowtail and tuna?

239
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:45,568
Talk about not even budging.

240
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:49,369
Well, to become a good angler, experience is what counts!

241
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:53,969
Okay! Experience is what it takes, experience.

242
00:12:55,469 --> 00:12:58,468
I'm going to go over to everyone else and see how they're doing.

243
00:12:58,469 --> 00:12:59,768
Please don't run.

244
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,569
I know...

245
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:06,268
Their fishing manners have improved.

246
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:07,969
Fantastic...

247
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:19,269
Thank you.

248
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,769
Good luck!

249
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,069
I wonder if she'll become a professional angler when she grows up.

250
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:30,068
Ayumi, did you learn anything?

251
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:34,668
He taught me how to hook the bait on and a lot of other things.

252
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:36,268
Really?

253
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:38,668
Maybe I'll have him teach me too.

254
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:41,268
There seems to be a lot of fish below

255
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:43,268
and I wonder why I still can't seem to catch anything?

256
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:47,468
He told me that the flow of the current is not good right now.

257
00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:51,168
I see. The flow of the current?

258
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:54,268
I'm going to catch a fish today, no matter what it takes.

259
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:56,969
If I can't fish anything today, when else can I?

260
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:03,768
No fish.

261
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:05,268
You can say that again.

262
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:08,568
Well, but the veterans over there haven't caught any either.

263
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:10,568
So I guess it can't be helped.

264
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:13,568
I'd like to at least catch one fish.

265
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:15,568
True, if we don't catch any,

266
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:18,169
the man will really make fun of us.

267
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:21,569
I'm getting sleepy again.

268
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:23,968
It's come!

269
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:26,168
-Really? -No doubt about it.

270
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,468
I've caught one!

271
00:14:27,469 --> 00:14:29,669
Hang in there, Mitsuhiko!

272
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:38,168
I did it! I finally caught one!

273
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,268
You did it! Mitsuhiko! You did it!

274
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:43,768
You did it, Mitsuhiko!

275
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:45,668
It's a nicely shaped mackerel!

276
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:48,068
Genta! I caught one!

277
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:49,768
See!

278
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:52,568
You caught one? Really?

279
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:55,668
Look... It's this big.

280
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:57,468
Mitsuhiko caught it!

281
00:14:57,469 --> 00:14:58,768
Yeap!

282
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:01,768
I'm happy for you!

283
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:04,068
I mean, it's so small...

284
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,968
As for me, I'm going for the big one. A sea bream!

285
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:08,968
You did it, didn't you, Mitsuhiko!

286
00:15:08,969 --> 00:15:10,868
You really know how to "make it roll" (mackerel)?

287
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:14,868
You did it, I've lost the bet.

288
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:16,769
Is this your bobber?

289
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:19,968
My bobber?

290
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:21,368
Thank you.

291
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:23,268
It drifted away.

292
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:25,768
Why do you have it?

293
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:28,368
Make sure you keep in on tight next time.

294
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:30,168
Okay!

295
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:34,668
The crab cream croquette she gave us sure is good, isn't it?

296
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:38,868
Eating in a place like this makes lunch taste even better, doesn't it?

297
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:41,568
Yes! It's delicious!

298
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:43,768
Nothing yet.

299
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:48,768
I guess Conan was right about no sea breams being here.

300
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:52,268
This is the worst time of day for fishing.

301
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:54,768
Morning or sundown is way better.

302
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:56,969
It seems everyone's having a hard time too.

303
00:15:58,469 --> 00:16:00,268
No bite what so ever.

304
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:02,568
Maybe I'll try changing the bait.

305
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:05,368
How about you? Anything?

306
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:08,268
No, nothing at all!

307
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:10,969
I wonder if the bait is on all right?

308
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:14,968
What's this? I feel something pulling.

309
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:16,368
It's big!

310
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:19,969
Conan, a whale! I can't lift it up!

311
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:23,968
It looks like your fishing line is tangled up somewhere.

312
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:27,768
Tangled? Is there a fish called tangled?

313
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:28,968
It's not a fish.

314
00:16:28,969 --> 00:16:31,168
Your line got caught and stuck to seaweed or a rock or something.

315
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:33,268
It's not a fish?

316
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:35,368
Then what do I do?

317
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,368
Don't pull too hard,

318
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:39,868
but rather, loosen and pull.

319
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:41,068
Like this?

320
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:42,969
Right, good. Repeat the process.

321
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:46,269
It's free.

322
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:49,968
What's this?

323
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:52,369
You sure fished a big one.

324
00:16:55,169 --> 00:16:57,569
Shoots, bait gone again.

325
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:02,868
Even the expert angler Ejiri is having a bad day today.

326
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:05,068
It looks like things aren't going well over there either.

327
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:07,069
Is it because of the tide?

328
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,968
Genta, aren't you going to eat lunch?

329
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:17,168
Yeah, I'll eat in a little while!

330
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:22,068
I can't believe that Genta is still not eating.

331
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:25,868
Yep... I wonder if he wants to fish sea bream that badly?

332
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,369
Sea bream is Genta's dream, please let him fish a sea bream.

333
00:17:30,469 --> 00:17:32,369
-Dr. Agasa! -Sorry.

334
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:36,569
Even so,

335
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:40,168
I'm so hungry right now.

336
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:42,468
Should eat my lunch or fish for the sea bream?

337
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:45,469
Will it be lunch or the sea bream?

338
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:48,368
It's lunch first after all!

339
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:52,968
Eating lunch while bathing in sea wind makes lunch tastier after all.

340
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:54,468
Don't you think so too, Ai?

341
00:17:54,469 --> 00:17:55,969
Aren't you glad you came?

342
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:05,768
Take your time and eat.

343
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:07,569
I've got no time to lose, you see.

344
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:10,869
The lunch tastes great here.

345
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:13,969
Thank you for the meal.

346
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:18,868
A record high eating speed.

347
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,568
Okay, I've finish eating my share,

348
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:22,868
now all I need is for the fish to eat my bait.

349
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,968
Come on, my dear sea bream.

350
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:26,169
Genta.

351
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:53,768
Oh, it's the ship!

352
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:55,668
It's that time of day already?

353
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:57,368
Shall we get ready to go, then?

354
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,868
Right.

355
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:01,968
He's already come for us. How fast.

356
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:04,668
Next, it's curry party time at Dr. Agasa house.

357
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:05,868
That's right.

358
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:08,468
Besides, maybe we can have mackerel sashimi.

359
00:19:08,469 --> 00:19:10,768
Rather, I guess it's too small for sashimi.

360
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:11,968
Mackerel, slash me.

361
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:12,969
Dr. Agasa!

362
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:18,668
How'd you do, caught anything?

363
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:22,769
Of course we caught nothing, as empty as no hair on my head.

364
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:25,768
Well, that's too bad.

365
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:27,368
How about you guys?

366
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:28,868
Empty here too.

367
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:31,168
I caught one small mackerel.

368
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:33,068
Big catch, big catch.

369
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:36,368
I say, we should change fishing spots from this afternoon.

370
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:39,568
True. But what about Ejiri...

371
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:43,668
He said that he's going to stick it out here till late in the day today.

372
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:47,369
Really? I'll go talk it over with Ida then.

373
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:58,168
Hey, Genta, give up already.

374
00:19:58,169 --> 00:19:59,668
We're going back.

375
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:00,769
Okay.

376
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:04,468
He says he'll go around over to where he went before.

377
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,568
Oh, that's good.

378
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:08,268
You're going to change places?

379
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:11,368
Yes, this place is no good today.

380
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:14,668
There's another spot nearby where we fished a lot before.

381
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:16,368
We're stopping by for a while.

382
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:18,568
Well, we're in no rush.

383
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:21,068
So, we're all going back together then?

384
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:23,968
No, Ejiri's going to stay there.

385
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:26,569
We're going to leave him behind alone?

386
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:29,168
No need to worry,

387
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:32,569
because Ida's boat will come for him again at sundown.

388
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:36,969
Ejiri really likes that place, doesn't he?

389
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:42,068
It sure was a lot of fun.

390
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:43,168
I'd like to come again.

391
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:45,068
Yes, next time I'd like to come

392
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:47,769
after doing some research as Dr. Agasa suggested.

393
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:52,568
Hey! We're going back!

394
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:55,268
Shoots, I wanted to fish. A sea bream.

395
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:57,669
All I fished was seaweed!

396
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:03,268
Another false call?

397
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:06,468
Okay, we'll be on our way then!

398
00:21:06,469 --> 00:21:08,368
Good luck!

399
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:10,468
No use calling out to him.

400
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,868
Once he starts fishing,

401
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:15,968
he's reticent and hardly ever talks!

402
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:16,969
Right.

403
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,368
He was saying that he's going to stick it out today too,

404
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:20,168
until he gets a big catch.

405
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:22,868
But he sure makes a lot of noise when he gets a big catch.

406
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:26,169
Just the other day, he got so excited that he almost fell off.

407
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:29,968
He sure is quiet today, though?

408
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:32,469
He's probably in deep thought or something.

409
00:21:35,469 --> 00:21:36,769
So, shall we get going?

410
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:44,968
It seems like he gotten a bite.

411
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:46,268
Yes, he's got a bite.

412
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:48,768
There's a bite. Don't you realize it?

413
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:52,568
Ejiri! You got a bite!

414
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:53,968
Ejiri?

415
00:21:53,969 --> 00:21:56,068
What's up? What's all the racket about?

416
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:58,768
That man seems to be asleep...

417
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:01,368
Asleep? You mean Ejiri?

418
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:02,469
No way.

419
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:09,068
What's the matter with him?

420
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,269
Ejiri?

421
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:16,169
Hey! Ejiri...

422
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:20,768
Ejiri?

423
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:21,968
What's up?

424
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:23,468
What's wrong?

425
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:24,668
What's going on?

426
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:26,069
Ejiri!

427
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,368
"Next Episode" -We've got to take this man on the ship right away

428
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:02,668
and head him off to the hospital!

429
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:04,268
Hurry!

430
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:05,668
Dear!

431
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:06,769
Don't move!

432
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:12,168
Don't touch anything and stay still!

433
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:14,468
What's up?

434
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:17,668
Who are you, sonny?

435
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:20,068
Conan Edogawa.

436
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:21,169
A detective.

437
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:27,669
Next Conan, "Tragedy of the Conspicuous Pier (Part 2)"

438
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:45,968
Next Conan's Hint:

439
00:24:45,969 --> 00:24:47,568
"Festival."

440
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,569
In the next episode, the case is solved.

441
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,968
The fishing case is finished!

442
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:52,369
What was that?
