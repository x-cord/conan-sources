1
00:00:00,586 --> 00:00:03,186
Kogoro Mouri disappears.

2
00:00:04,586 --> 00:00:07,085
But the fact was that he was working undercover in cooperation

3
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:10,186
with Inspector Megure to approach a band of robbers.

4
00:00:11,086 --> 00:00:12,785
Mr. Head, the boss whose face is unknown,

5
00:00:12,786 --> 00:00:16,085
sees through Kogoro's true identity

6
00:00:16,086 --> 00:00:18,286
and requests him to do an unexpected investigation.

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,185
She's a cute daughter, isn't she?

8
00:00:22,186 --> 00:00:23,785
Ran!

9
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:26,985
Why you... What're you up to?

10
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:29,585
It's up to you.

11
00:00:29,586 --> 00:00:31,885
Darn it! What do you want?

12
00:00:31,886 --> 00:00:33,685
Just as expected of a great detective,

13
00:00:33,686 --> 00:00:35,485
getting right to the point.

14
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:37,185
Hurry spit it out!

15
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:38,585
You deliberately disguised yourself

16
00:00:38,586 --> 00:00:40,885
and almost succeeded your mission.

17
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:44,285
So, just as scheduled,

18
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:47,085
work along with my men as a skilled safe breaker.

19
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:49,385
What?

20
00:00:49,386 --> 00:00:51,285
The fact is...

21
00:00:51,286 --> 00:00:54,386
Among my men, there's the one who killed my son.

22
00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:59,985
I'd like you to determine who it is with your skills as a great detective

23
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:02,885
by dawn, of the day after tomorrow.

24
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:05,285
What?

25
00:01:05,286 --> 00:01:07,485
Dawn day after tomorrow is also the time,

26
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:12,585
when we carry out our plan this time and leave Japan behind us.

27
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:14,985
That's why I need you to do so by then.

28
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:17,285
What, after specifying who it is?

29
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,485
Are you planning to avenge the death of your son?

30
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:21,885
That's none of your business.

31
00:01:21,886 --> 00:01:25,285
But, if you refuse my request,

32
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:29,085
you'll never see your daughter again.

33
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:34,185
If the killer isn't instructed to cancel before the time limited by me,

34
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:38,585
he will kill her.

35
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:41,485
Don't tell me you had this in mind to begin with.

36
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:42,785
Darn it!

37
00:01:42,786 --> 00:01:46,285
But I believe in...

38
00:01:46,286 --> 00:01:50,785
Kogoro Mouri, your skills as a great detective!

39
00:01:50,786 --> 00:01:52,086
What?

40
00:01:55,386 --> 00:01:57,085
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

41
00:01:57,086 --> 00:01:59,785
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

42
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,485
Pops and I are in a Catch -22 situation.

43
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:03,585
The unexpected purpose of the band of robbers.

44
00:02:03,586 --> 00:02:05,285
He sees through the one and only truth.

45
00:02:05,286 --> 00:02:07,185
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

46
00:02:07,186 --> 00:02:09,486
His name is Detective Conan!

47
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:53,523
"The Great Detective is Manipulated (Part 2)"

48
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:58,622
They haven't been found yet?

49
00:03:58,623 --> 00:04:01,422
No, not yet! But time-wise,

50
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:04,822
it's hard to think that they got through the emergency alert.

51
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:07,822
They probably have a secret hide-out somewhere.

52
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:11,223
And are waiting for a chance to flee.

53
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:14,923
The problem is where.

54
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:22,122
Darn it! All we got are the wallets of the customers!

55
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:23,422
If we got the safe opened,

56
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,923
it wouldn't have been anything like this!

57
00:04:28,123 --> 00:04:31,622
Gosh. Why are you in a place like this?

58
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:34,422
No, no, let me go!

59
00:04:34,423 --> 00:04:37,522
Cut out the fuss! I'll crush you!

60
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:39,322
I'm scared!

61
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:41,322
Cut out the noise, you brat!

62
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,422
Stop it! He's just a kid.

63
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:45,422
You're way noisier than he is!

64
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:47,322
-What? -What?

65
00:04:47,323 --> 00:04:49,422
Cut it out, both of you!

66
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,722
Never mind that.

67
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:56,322
Mr. Head! I wanna ask you something!

68
00:04:56,323 --> 00:05:00,422
Why's Kogoro Mouri here?

69
00:05:00,423 --> 00:05:02,522
You brought him here!

70
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:05,923
You better give me an answer that'll convince me!

71
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:09,623
Are you listening, Head?

72
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:19,022
Do you remember?

73
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:22,922
This underground casino is the one that you guys attacked a year ago.

74
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,923
One of my comrades were killed there.

75
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:30,222
I want to know the truth of what happened a year ago.

76
00:05:30,223 --> 00:05:34,122
In other words, I asked the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri

77
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:38,322
to figure out who killed my son.

78
00:05:38,323 --> 00:05:41,322
He was your son?

79
00:05:41,323 --> 00:05:43,222
That good-for-nothing brat?

80
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:44,622
It's a first.

81
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:47,022
Oh, what a surprise.

82
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:51,422
It's best to leave things like these up to specialists, you see.

83
00:05:51,423 --> 00:05:54,222
I'm counting on you, Great Detective.

84
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:57,723
Leave it to me. But, don't forget.

85
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:03,022
Good luck.

86
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:04,522
Pim...

87
00:06:04,523 --> 00:06:09,322
Mr. Pimple was killed by the people at the underground casino.

88
00:06:09,323 --> 00:06:12,722
You were convinced of that a year ago, too.

89
00:06:12,723 --> 00:06:14,222
Why bring it up again like this?

90
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:15,622
Not worth it!

91
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:18,123
I can't be playing along with this!

92
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:21,322
What?

93
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:22,623
It won't open!

94
00:06:24,123 --> 00:06:25,622
Just what are you up to?

95
00:06:25,623 --> 00:06:26,623
When the time comes,

96
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:29,522
the lock of the door will open automatically.

97
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:32,423
If you try to flee before that...

98
00:06:34,323 --> 00:06:36,922
There's no guarantee that you'll live.

99
00:06:36,923 --> 00:06:40,122
Hey, hold it! I've got nothing to do with this.

100
00:06:40,123 --> 00:06:44,222
I was just waiting in the car like usual, you know!

101
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,322
I heard that Pim was killed after everything happened, too!

102
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:50,922
Then, let's go over the details of the incident

103
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:52,823
that happened a year ago.

104
00:06:57,123 --> 00:07:01,322
It may have been my mistake

105
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:04,723
to add Mr. Pimple to the job we did a year ago.

106
00:07:07,023 --> 00:07:08,422
I'm sorry!

107
00:07:08,423 --> 00:07:09,922
Come on. Be more careful, will you?

108
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:11,723
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:16,522
He stood out so much.

110
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:18,522
Talk about a good-for-nothing brat...

111
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:21,322
Making him go there beforehand was just a waste of time.

112
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:23,522
Wanna crush him once?

113
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:25,323
It's about time we go.

114
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:30,622
What?

115
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:33,422
Nobody move! Hands in the air!

116
00:07:33,423 --> 00:07:35,222
Do as you're told!

117
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:36,823
If you resist, I'll crush you!

118
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,223
Put the wallets in there!

119
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,823
Hey! Hurry it up!

120
00:07:49,723 --> 00:07:52,022
-What's going on? -What's up?

121
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:54,022
Help!

122
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:55,922
-What is it? Gunshots! -I'm scared!

123
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:58,223
-The lights are back on! -Is he dead?

124
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:01,423
What happened?

125
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:06,522
Fire!

126
00:08:06,523 --> 00:08:08,822
-Run! -Hurry! I don't want to die!

127
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:10,123
Run for it!

128
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:14,322
So Mr. Pimple was found,

129
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:18,123
as a burnt unidentified body from the burnt remains.

130
00:08:19,923 --> 00:08:24,422
But this is based only on what you guys reported to me.

131
00:08:24,423 --> 00:08:26,322
Just what do you mean?

132
00:08:26,323 --> 00:08:28,123
Look at this.

133
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:31,322
This is the image that was found on the security camera

134
00:08:31,323 --> 00:08:33,822
that was set up in that underground casino.

135
00:08:33,823 --> 00:08:35,122
Great Detective.

136
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:37,822
Does looking at this bring any questions to mind?

137
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:39,822
What? Yeah.

138
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:41,423
Well...

139
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:48,322
Back then, you were disguised as customers and snuck in, right?

140
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:51,422
Yeah. That's why we let Pim in first

141
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:54,122
and made him hide the guns and knives.

142
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:57,322
Mr. Pim was disguised as a waiter, right?

143
00:08:57,323 --> 00:09:00,922
That's right, although it turned out that way.

144
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:03,622
He was crushed because he asked for it.

145
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:05,222
That's right.

146
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:07,923
And? Is there anything else?

147
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:11,022
The floor is spic-and-span.

148
00:09:11,023 --> 00:09:15,422
It's called marble, right? That floor.

149
00:09:15,423 --> 00:09:17,322
True.

150
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,623
So, what about it?

151
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:23,322
Darn it. Shape up, man.

152
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:24,622
Hey.

153
00:09:24,623 --> 00:09:27,722
That wound on your finger, did somebody bite you?

154
00:09:27,723 --> 00:09:29,222
What?

155
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:30,622
This is...

156
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,722
I was bitten by a dog, long time ago.

157
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:35,223
The knife, too?

158
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:37,622
Because there's a scratch

159
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:40,722
that looks like the handle of the knife's been bitten, too.

160
00:09:40,723 --> 00:09:42,122
Yeah.

161
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,422
I jokingly scared it. It bit my hand and knife.

162
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:49,622
Strange. No dog was seen on the screen at the casino.

163
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:50,623
What?

164
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:54,323
But, in the image where Mr. Pin was lying on the floor a while ago...

165
00:09:55,223 --> 00:09:57,322
Help!

166
00:09:57,323 --> 00:09:59,922
-What is it? Gunshots! -I'm scared!

167
00:09:59,923 --> 00:10:01,922
The lights are back on!

168
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:03,623
-Is he dead? -What happened?

169
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:07,723
Pim?

170
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:13,622
I see! The dog that you're referring to is Mr. Pim, right?

171
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:16,123
Look! There's blood on his mouth!

172
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:20,222
It's just a coincidence!

173
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:22,922
I was bitten by a dog in the neighborhood.

174
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,022
Then, show me your knife!

175
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:26,023
Just by looking at it,

176
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:28,223
we can tell if it's the teeth of a human's or a dog's!

177
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:50,341
Crap!

178
00:10:50,342 --> 00:10:52,441
He was shot to death!

179
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:54,241
My knife had nothing to do with it!

180
00:10:54,242 --> 00:10:56,341
Awesome!

181
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:58,941
This is called an automatic, right?

182
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:01,241
When you fire, the cartridges fall to the floor

183
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:03,942
and bounce making clanking sounds.

184
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:09,841
I see. The sound!

185
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:13,141
Let me see the place that Mr. Pim was shot one more time!

186
00:11:13,142 --> 00:11:16,241
Right after the gunshot that was heard during the blackout,

187
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,042
I'm sure you didn't hear the cartridge bounce on the floor!

188
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:22,441
Help!

189
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:25,041
-What is it? A gunshot! -I'm scared!

190
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:26,142
The lights are back on!

191
00:11:27,342 --> 00:11:30,041
Which means... it was a revolver?

192
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:31,741
Exactly!

193
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:35,641
Hey, hey. As you can see, this is an automatic.

194
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:39,641
Maybe another one was snuck in or something.

195
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:45,842
If so, it would be impossible to get through the metal detector.

196
00:11:47,142 --> 00:11:51,641
It's neither ceramic nor plastic...

197
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:54,842
If it's made of...

198
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:58,941
I see. Resin!

199
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:00,241
If the gun is made of resin,

200
00:12:00,242 --> 00:12:02,541
the metal detector won't detect it!

201
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:06,041
Furthermore, if such a thing were to be prepared beforehand,

202
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:09,341
it was contemplated murder!

203
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:12,641
There's no way that it would be someone from the casino side.

204
00:12:12,642 --> 00:12:15,841
Because they would've known nothing about the attack on the casino!

205
00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:20,341
It's only an assumption but during the blackout,

206
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:23,141
first Mr. Mouth uses his knife to render Mr. Pimple motionless.

207
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,942
Then, Mr. Eyes fires the bullet.

208
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:28,841
And made it look as if

209
00:12:28,842 --> 00:12:31,441
somebody from the underground casino did it.

210
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:35,241
Then, are you saying that Mr. Mouth and I are the ones who did it?

211
00:12:35,242 --> 00:12:37,041
Right!

212
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:40,741
Why don't we try it out, then, Mr. Great Detective?

213
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:41,742
What?

214
00:12:41,743 --> 00:12:43,241
Isn't that why you went all out

215
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:47,242
and made a grand set like this, right, Mr. Head?

216
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:51,541
What's the matter? Exhausted or what?

217
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,441
Or have you run out of battery?

218
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:55,242
That's a good one.

219
00:12:57,742 --> 00:12:59,041
Never mind.

220
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:00,441
A year ago...

221
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:04,941
If Pimple was standing there before the blackout,

222
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:08,741
I was standing around here.

223
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:11,641
It seems that the place I'm in is here.

224
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:14,141
I'm here.

225
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:16,541
The blackout was 10 seconds.

226
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:18,841
The gunshot was heard 5 seconds after the blackout.

227
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:22,041
That's about it, I think. Right, Mr. Great Detective?

228
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:24,041
Yeah.

229
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:25,441
Then, here goes.

230
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:27,041
Okay!

231
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:28,342
Start!

232
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,141
Help!

233
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:35,541
-What is it? A gunshot! -I'm scared!

234
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:36,942
It's dark!

235
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:41,941
The lights are back on!

236
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:43,341
Time out.

237
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:45,541
I guess it really wasn't like this.

238
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:48,141
We barely made it.

239
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:51,441
In the dark of the blackout, it was panic.

240
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:54,042
No good.

241
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:02,141
So, it's almost dawn.

242
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,841
What now, Great Detective?

243
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:06,341
What a goofy detective.

244
00:14:06,342 --> 00:14:08,742
He should be crushed after all.

245
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:13,742
Hey, why did everybody close their eyes before the blackout?

246
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:25,541
But only Mr. Pim like the other customers didn't close his eyes.

247
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:26,741
I got it!

248
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:30,241
You guys knew that the blackout would occur beforehand.

249
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:32,641
Then, you set a timer onto the supply transfer panel

250
00:14:32,642 --> 00:14:34,641
ahead of time and rigged it

251
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:38,741
so that the blackout would occur at a set time.

252
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:41,241
Nobody move! Hands in the air!

253
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:42,841
Do as you're told!

254
00:14:42,842 --> 00:14:44,742
If you resist, I'll crush you!

255
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:48,542
Put the wallets in there!

256
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:51,842
Hey! Hurry it up!

257
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:04,842
Don't move!

258
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,841
-What is it? Gunshot! -I'm scared!

259
00:15:11,842 --> 00:15:13,142
The lights are back on!

260
00:15:14,142 --> 00:15:16,342
-Is he dead? -What happened?

261
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:21,742
-Fire! -Help!

262
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:26,641
It's obvious that you guys are the ones who set this fire, too.

263
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:29,441
In order to escape and get rid of the evidence.

264
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:30,541
You idiot!

265
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:32,841
That's why I told you to throw that away immediately.

266
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:35,341
Shut up! This is my partner!

267
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:36,642
Shut up!

268
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:41,841
I've done my job, Mr. Head!

269
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:44,741
Tell the killer to stop the killing right away!

270
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:48,641
Don't lay a finger on my daughter Ran!

271
00:15:48,642 --> 00:15:50,042
I knew it.

272
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:00,941
What's the matter?

273
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:03,741
Nothing. It's nothing.

274
00:16:03,742 --> 00:16:07,241
Rather, is the detective's deduction for real?

275
00:16:07,242 --> 00:16:11,641
Yeah, you did splendid, Great Detective.

276
00:16:11,642 --> 00:16:17,741
Out of all people, Pim found out about our plan to kill Mr. Head

277
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:20,941
and take the loot for ourselves.

278
00:16:20,942 --> 00:16:25,241
Well, we had no other choice, you see.

279
00:16:25,242 --> 00:16:27,442
The same this time, too!

280
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:37,741
We've finally met, Mr. Head!

281
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:39,142
What?

282
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,241
Conan?

283
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,041
Ran. If you're safe,

284
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:55,441
please contact Inspector Megure right away.

285
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:56,941
Pops and I are fine.

286
00:16:56,942 --> 00:16:58,441
We're with the band of robbers.

287
00:16:58,442 --> 00:17:00,141
The place is at the warehouse district by the harbor.

288
00:17:00,142 --> 00:17:02,141
For details, check the GPS.

289
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:06,542
What? What does he mean by if I'm safe?

290
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:09,542
But at any rate, I'd better call Inspector Megure!

291
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:18,241
The detection system of the auto control...

292
00:17:18,242 --> 00:17:21,641
Remote controlling it from inside your pocket.

293
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:24,341
And this is...

294
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:26,341
It's the image of the security camera

295
00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:29,141
that was set up in the underground casino.

296
00:17:29,142 --> 00:17:32,241
I asked the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri

297
00:17:32,242 --> 00:17:34,641
to figure out who killed my son.

298
00:17:34,642 --> 00:17:37,341
You recorded your own voice that you processed

299
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:39,141
and played it with the remote controller,

300
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:43,741
and acted out a client with no face.

301
00:17:43,742 --> 00:17:46,541
You did it wanting to avenge the death of your son?

302
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:49,841
What clowns we were.

303
00:17:49,842 --> 00:17:53,641
I gave birth to him when I was 15.

304
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:55,941
Sending him out to a foster home

305
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:59,041
wanting him to lead a normal life was my mistake.

306
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:00,641
On top of becoming a delinquent,

307
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:04,241
he was hired even without knowing who I was.

308
00:18:04,242 --> 00:18:06,042
How ironic.

309
00:18:19,742 --> 00:18:22,041
Sorry, Mr. Detective.

310
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:25,142
I'm sorry for getting you messed up in this too, sonny.

311
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:32,241
I'll instruct the killer to stop the deal right away.

312
00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:33,742
Are you sure?

313
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:39,341
What're you doing?

314
00:18:39,342 --> 00:18:41,441
Are you planning to die with them?

315
00:18:41,442 --> 00:18:44,041
To compensate the death of your son?

316
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:45,742
If so, take a look!

317
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:50,041
Mr. Pimple is still alive!

318
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:51,841
Look carefully at his mouth.

319
00:18:51,842 --> 00:18:53,542
He saying something.

320
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:05,542
Mother, don't already. Cut it out.

321
00:19:09,742 --> 00:19:17,241
It seems he knew that you, Ms. Lip was in fact Mr. Head

322
00:19:17,242 --> 00:19:19,941
and his mother as well.

323
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:24,041
Or it could be that he decided to deliberately get hired by you

324
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:26,542
to stop you from committing crimes.

325
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:29,141
No way.

326
00:19:29,142 --> 00:19:31,041
If he's alive,

327
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:35,042
I'm sure he would stop you again like he did there.

328
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:53,641
-Mr. Mouri! -Conan!

329
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:55,441
Hey! Don't die!

330
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:58,641
You gotta contact the killer! Please...

331
00:19:58,642 --> 00:19:59,842
Darn it!

332
00:20:14,742 --> 00:20:16,242
Ran...

333
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:48,441
Ms. Ran Mouri?

334
00:20:48,442 --> 00:20:51,241
I've come for you.

335
00:20:51,242 --> 00:20:52,441
Yes.

336
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:55,642
-Please get in. -Okay.

337
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:02,542
Don't get in! Ran!

338
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:14,341
Darn it!

339
00:21:14,342 --> 00:21:15,742
Run for it!

340
00:21:20,242 --> 00:21:22,242
Come here, you!

341
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,441
Dad?

342
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:30,741
Ran!

343
00:21:30,742 --> 00:21:32,541
Are you all right?

344
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,142
Ran!

345
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:40,241
Dad, you're hurting me.

346
00:21:40,242 --> 00:21:45,041
I was... I was so worried.

347
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:46,642
I made it.

348
00:21:48,242 --> 00:21:50,141
Ms. Lip was shot by Mr. Eyes

349
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,741
and was taken to an emergency hospital

350
00:21:53,742 --> 00:21:56,041
and somehow made it through.

351
00:21:56,042 --> 00:21:58,942
The band of robbers was all arrested.

352
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:23,541
I really worried about both of you, you know.

353
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:25,141
Are you guys listening?

354
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:27,941
Dad? Conan?

355
00:23:27,942 --> 00:23:31,242
I'm listening so give me another shot, will you?

356
00:23:32,342 --> 00:23:35,842
I'm listening, so let me sleep.

357
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:39,442
What's with you two?

358
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:44,241
"Next Episode" -We formed a group

359
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:47,941
to protect the peace and safety of the people.

360
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:50,042
The silver detective squad!

361
00:23:51,242 --> 00:23:53,042
What is it?

362
00:23:55,942 --> 00:24:01,141
Which means, I'm you? Conan?

363
00:24:01,142 --> 00:24:03,641
You don't have to go out of your way to overlay yourselves with us.

364
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,042
It looks like things are going to get complicated again.

365
00:24:06,842 --> 00:24:12,042
