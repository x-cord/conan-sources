1
00:00:00,641 --> 00:00:02,640
Invited by Heiji Hattori,

2
00:00:02,641 --> 00:00:04,740
we came to a hot spring inn

3
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:08,340
that is famous for their kudzu drink.

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,440
We go to the storeroom of the inn

5
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:13,440
and encounter an incident where Pops Kogoro, Hattori

6
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:18,740
and a guest at the inn, Ms. Midori Koyanagi are slashed.

7
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:19,841
And furthermore...

8
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,841
Grand Master!

9
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,840
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

10
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:34,040
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

11
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,740
Kamaitachi that runs over water.

12
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:38,240
The deduction of the two exposes the demon.

13
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:39,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:41,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,941
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:22,998 --> 00:02:28,798
"Kamaitachi Inn (Part 2)"

17
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:31,397
Grand Master?

18
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:32,697
Grand Master!

19
00:02:32,698 --> 00:02:35,198
Don't go into the room!

20
00:02:35,998 --> 00:02:37,797
He's already dead.

21
00:02:37,798 --> 00:02:40,897
Rigor mortis hasn't set in yet,

22
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:44,197
so he died just less than 30 minutes ago.

23
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:46,397
Why is the sickle here though...

24
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:48,797
Wasn't the Gunma police investigating it?

25
00:02:48,798 --> 00:02:51,497
Oh, that's because when we checked it a while ago,

26
00:02:51,498 --> 00:02:53,697
there was no luminol reaction.

27
00:02:53,698 --> 00:02:55,397
I thought it wasn't involved with the case,

28
00:02:55,398 --> 00:02:57,297
so I returned it to the storeroom.

29
00:02:57,298 --> 00:03:00,197
The forensic officers were all sent back the station too.

30
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:01,597
I see.

31
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,097
Which means the perp could take this sickle out freely.

32
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:07,998
Something's strange.

33
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,797
The sliding door

34
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:13,297
was cut by the sickle that is poked into gramps, right?

35
00:03:13,298 --> 00:03:15,997
Yeah. Most probably.

36
00:03:15,998 --> 00:03:19,997
Then why is there blood on the top part of the cut place?

37
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:21,497
Well, after all a human's been slashed,

38
00:03:21,498 --> 00:03:22,498
so no doubt blood would be on it.

39
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:28,097
But that means that gramps was slashed with this sickle first

40
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:30,697
before slashing the paper sliding door,

41
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:34,097
then poked again with the sickle, right?

42
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:36,097
True.

43
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:37,698
A performance.

44
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:42,397
To make it look as if he was attacked by Kamaitachi.

45
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:44,197
Then,

46
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:47,497
was keeping the light from turning on also a performance?

47
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:50,697
The breaker of this annex was shut down,

48
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:54,397
and there's a strange trace at the place the perp snuck in too.

49
00:03:54,398 --> 00:03:55,997
A strange trace?

50
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:56,998
This way!

51
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:02,597
This is probably where the perp snuck in from.

52
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:05,097
The glass is broken.

53
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:07,297
And what about the strange trace?

54
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:11,297
The footprints from this porch to that fence are mine but...

55
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:14,797
On the side in the snow, there is a shallow dug, right?

56
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:17,197
Isn't that because the perp walked back and forth

57
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:20,597
erasing his footprints with the sickle, no?

58
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:22,297
We know that too.

59
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:25,397
The real problem is what lies beyond this fence.

60
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,598
Beyond it? Don't tell me...

61
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:30,097
The outdoor bath?

62
00:04:30,098 --> 00:04:34,697
Look, the arch is dug only to here.

63
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:37,097
In other words, when the culprit committed the crime...

64
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:40,898
He ran across the water...

65
00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:43,797
as if he was riding on the wind.

66
00:04:43,798 --> 00:04:46,597
No way. Could such a feat be done?

67
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:48,097
It's Kamaitachi!

68
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:50,897
Kamaitachi does exist after all?

69
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:52,697
Don't be ridiculous!

70
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,897
There's some kind of trick involved here!

71
00:04:54,898 --> 00:04:57,997
Of course, done by an authentic human!

72
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,997
Kamaitachi.

73
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:01,797
Kamaitachi appeared?

74
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:04,097
Is it true, Heiji?

75
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:05,497
How do you know?

76
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:07,497
Inspector Yamamura came a while ago and...

77
00:05:07,498 --> 00:05:09,797
Told us!

78
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:13,298
The suspect is Kamaitachi.

79
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:16,597
Some idiot pretending to be Kamaitachi appeared.

80
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:19,097
But, wasn't it the Kamaitachi that messed up this room

81
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:21,197
that we were decorating too?

82
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:22,897
The fluorescent light suddenly cracked,

83
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:26,197
and all the balloons that we decorated all burst too!

84
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:27,298
Airsoft pellets.

85
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:31,198
There are airsoft pellets on the floor.

86
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:33,698
Come to think of it,

87
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:37,997
your late husband used to play survival games, correct?

88
00:05:37,998 --> 00:05:38,998
Yes.

89
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:41,297
Where's that air gun now?

90
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:42,697
My husband's belongings,

91
00:05:42,698 --> 00:05:45,297
everything except what's precious is in the storeroom.

92
00:05:45,298 --> 00:05:47,897
Then the perp probably took it out of the storeroom

93
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:49,997
and fired through the sliding paper door.

94
00:05:49,998 --> 00:05:53,397
See, one of the sections can be flipped open.

95
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:55,697
But there were about 10 balloons and yet

96
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:57,697
all of them practically burst at once.

97
00:05:57,698 --> 00:06:00,697
You can't do something like that in the dark!

98
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:03,297
Well, if you keep firing, you could probably hit at least 10.

99
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:06,997
I don't think the balloons were cracked by airsoft pellets.

100
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:09,398
Because there are only about three pellets on the floor.

101
00:06:10,398 --> 00:06:11,798
What's this smell?

102
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:13,997
What? What's wrong?

103
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,597
Don't you smell something?

104
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:17,297
Be careful, you two.

105
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:18,597
Because the cracked pieces of fluorescent light

106
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:20,697
are still on the floor.

107
00:06:20,698 --> 00:06:24,097
My wristwatch light is ready to go out.

108
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:26,298
Well, I guess I've got to use the light of my smartphone.

109
00:06:26,798 --> 00:06:28,897
Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha?

110
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:31,197
What? What about me?

111
00:06:31,198 --> 00:06:35,597
It's not you Kazuha. It's 'cooking'.

112
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:39,197
I thought this smell reminded me of some side dish.

113
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,997
I'm gonna get you for this!

114
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:42,097
Sorry.

115
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:43,297
It's not the smell of a side dish

116
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:45,497
but rather of the bathroom and detergent!

117
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:49,397
And it was cold, like rain water or something.

118
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:51,897
Right, right? Some got on me too.

119
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:55,197
The window wasn't open and yet really strange, right?

120
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:57,697
Well, either way there's no doubt that

121
00:06:57,698 --> 00:07:00,197
all those here aren't the perp.

122
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:02,297
Because when the scream of the Grand Master was heard,

123
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:04,797
everybody was standing in front of this room.

124
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:06,897
But it's amazing how you could tell that

125
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:10,697
it was the voice of the Grand Master just by hearing the scream.

126
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:15,097
I just thought it was and confirmed it with Takami.

127
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:18,897
It's because I've heard a familiar scream once before in the past.

128
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:20,997
When was that? Where?

129
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:23,497
When the TV station came for an interview before,

130
00:07:23,498 --> 00:07:28,197
we were offering a vital point foot massage service to the guests.

131
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,597
Since the guests become hesitant in front of TV cameras,

132
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,097
Grand Master had no choice but to undergo the massage himself.

133
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:36,997
The scream that he let out when there was pain

134
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,497
was very similar to the scream a while ago.

135
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:42,897
You've got that program recorded tape, do you?

136
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:46,897
Yes. I think we can take a look at it at the office.

137
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:48,797
-Let's go there, then! -Okay!

138
00:07:48,798 --> 00:07:51,698
All the rest of you, be sure to stay close together in one room!

139
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:54,397
Gosh.

140
00:07:54,398 --> 00:07:56,897
I had something I wanted to tell you,

141
00:07:56,898 --> 00:07:59,097
but everything's gone down the drain because of Kamaitachi.

142
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:02,197
What did you want to talk to me about?

143
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:06,497
Well, the other day on Ebisu Bridge in Osaka...

144
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:08,897
"Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha?"

145
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:11,197
"I'm gonna get you!"

146
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:15,297
You mean Hattori really said that to the investigator?

147
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:18,097
I may be exaggerating things a bit,

148
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,297
but, it was more or less like so.

149
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:23,397
And how was Hattori after that?

150
00:08:23,398 --> 00:08:26,298
He kind of played dumb.

151
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:30,298
Maybe Heiji... he...

152
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:33,198
What about you, Kazuha?

153
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:37,498
Really thinks of me just as his "subordinate"?

154
00:08:39,298 --> 00:08:42,797
You see, like they usually say in samurai movies!

155
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:45,898
Keep your hands off my cute subordinate and so forth...

156
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:48,097
Kazuha!

157
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:51,798
I don't think he thinks of you as a subordinate!

158
00:08:57,398 --> 00:09:00,897
This massage seems to be really effective.

159
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:04,997
-Oh, yes. -It sure sounds the same.

160
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:07,097
By the way, were there any guests who had a grudge against

161
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:08,197
the Grand Master?

162
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:13,997
He was full of hospitality, so I think the guests liked him.

163
00:09:13,998 --> 00:09:16,498
To the guests, which means?

164
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:21,597
Yes. He was very strict towards me, the waitstaff, and the cooks.

165
00:09:21,598 --> 00:09:25,797
I heard that there was once a chief of the waitstaff who was fired

166
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,997
and kicked out of this inn before.

167
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:30,497
Do you remember that person name?

168
00:09:30,498 --> 00:09:31,597
No.

169
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:35,397
I heard about it when I married and came here.

170
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:38,497
If I remember correctly, she seemed to have had a child with her.

171
00:09:38,498 --> 00:09:43,897
By the way, do those two writers frequent this inn?

172
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:46,597
Yes. Ms. Koyanagi only comes sometimes,

173
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:48,997
but Mr. Nakama comes frequently.

174
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:52,397
Come to think of it, a year ago

175
00:09:52,398 --> 00:09:54,097
on the day that Kohei almost drowned,

176
00:09:54,098 --> 00:09:57,198
those two were staying here too.

177
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:01,797
The storeroom was first broken into that day, too.

178
00:10:01,798 --> 00:10:05,897
Kohei had to be taken to the hospital, and the police came over.

179
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,197
It was total chaos.

180
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:11,797
So, I wasn't even able to clean the outdoor bath that day.

181
00:10:11,798 --> 00:10:15,997
Did the two make any strange moves that day?

182
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:18,197
No, I didn't notice anything in particular.

183
00:10:18,198 --> 00:10:22,798
But, they seem a bit different from the usual this time.

184
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:26,897
Mr. Nakama didn't have a goatee before.

185
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:30,797
And Ms. Koyanagi wasn't wearing glasses.

186
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:34,197
Maybe they just felt like changing how they looked?

187
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:36,497
I guess so.

188
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:39,897
This snow isn't letting up, though.

189
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:40,898
True.

190
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:42,897
Oh, no!

191
00:10:42,898 --> 00:10:46,497
One hour and 28 minutes have already passed since the corpse was found.

192
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:47,997
We've got to solve the trick as soon as possible

193
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:49,997
or the situation surrounding the crime scene will change

194
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:51,297
because of the snow.

195
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:54,997
How do you know the time so accurately?

196
00:10:54,998 --> 00:10:57,597
Because back then, it was dark for a while.

197
00:10:57,598 --> 00:10:59,897
My watch is a luminous painted watch,

198
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:01,998
so I can see it clearly even in the dark...

199
00:11:02,998 --> 00:11:05,397
I see, so that's it!

200
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,698
That's why back then, the perp...

201
00:11:08,098 --> 00:11:11,497
I don't know if this is the appropriate time to say this but...

202
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:14,297
Would you like some Kudzu drink because it's cold?

203
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,497
Oh, yes, by all means!

204
00:11:16,498 --> 00:11:17,798
It would really be warming!

205
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:20,198
I see.

206
00:11:20,873 --> 00:11:23,273
So, that's the story.

207
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:26,197
Now I see the demon's...

208
00:11:26,198 --> 00:11:28,298
True colors...

209
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,969
What? You want to recreate the crime?

210
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,569
Yeah. After hearing the Grand Master scream,

211
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,869
we came to this outdoor bath that is the short cut to the annex,

212
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,069
But since we had to cross the bath to get to the annex,

213
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,169
we went outside of the inn once

214
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,469
and decided to go from the back door.

215
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,969
That was of course after we checked that

216
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,869
there were no transparent plates inside the water.

217
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,969
Okay then, let's go outside once

218
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,569
and go to the annex from the back door!

219
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,069
Hey, aren't you going?

220
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,569
Nope. Because it's cold outside and the annex is far!

221
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,770
Gosh.

222
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,269
And so we came to the annex through the back door.

223
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,769
But the lights of the annex were out

224
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,269
because the breaker was shut down and it was pitch dark.

225
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,469
Having no other choice, we turned on the lights.

226
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,069
And found the torn sliding paper door.

227
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,669
Then when we went inside,

228
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,970
we found the Grand Master had been killed with the sickle!

229
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,769
The progression of what happened is correct, right?

230
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,569
I think so.

231
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,369
And where does this take us?

232
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,069
Maybe he means that there's somebody who got here faster

233
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,869
than the people who went through the back door?

234
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,969
I mean, how come you're here?

235
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,569
I came through the outdoor bath so I got here fast.

236
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,969
-The outdoor bath? -Yes!

237
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,869
But your clothes don't look all that wet.

238
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,169
Don't tell me that you came naked and splashed through the water?

239
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,969
No.

240
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,569
I ran!

241
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,070
Over the water of the outdoor bath!

242
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,469
You mean you can really run over it?

243
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,669
Yes!

244
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,369
I'll show you!

245
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,570
Hey!

246
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,069
He went and ran over the water like he said!

247
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,269
No joke?

248
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,369
See!

249
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,070
I'm sure there's some transparent plate or something in the water.

250
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,470
Hey. What's that?

251
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,869
I guess there're no plates.

252
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,869
I mean, what's this slimy water anyway?

253
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,769
Kudzu water.

254
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:40,969
Kudzu water?

255
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,669
Right. More accurately said,

256
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,369
it's right in between liquid and solid matter

257
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,369
before turning into kudzu.

258
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,569
It's a phenomenon known as dialatancy.

259
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,969
When weak force is slowly applied, the outcome is a slimy liquid,

260
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,169
but if strong force is applied at once,

261
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,070
it solidifies and becomes hard!

262
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,469
As proof of that, Kohei said he chased after the Kamaitachi

263
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,269
and almost drowned, right?

264
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,369
That was because the water back then was the same as this!

265
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,069
This is like quicksand, you see.

266
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,469
True.

267
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,969
Then, the perp went through here too?

268
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,970
Yeah!

269
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:24,569
And after killing the Grand Master, the perp joined us.

270
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,969
Isn't that right?

271
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,470
Writer Ms. Midori Koyanagi.

272
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,269
That's why you shut down the breaker of the annex

273
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,169
and went out of your way to slash the paper door.

274
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,469
Because with our attention on the torn paper door

275
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,269
after turning on the light,

276
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,469
joining us without being noticed is easier.

277
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,769
How was the kudzu powder brought here?

278
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,469
I think you'd need a large amount of kudzu powder

279
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,569
to make this special water?

280
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,069
It seems that the storeroom was burglarized a few days ago

281
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,669
so I guess it was stolen back then.

282
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,769
But, what was she going to do

283
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,569
with this large amount of kudzu powder left in the water?

284
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,169
The water in this hot spring flows directly from the source.

285
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,169
So, it'll wash away on its own in time.

286
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,369
Then, the person who messed up

287
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,469
the decoration for Kohei's birthday party was also...

288
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,170
Ms. Koyanagi.

289
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,869
Because if it hadn't been for that commotion,

290
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,169
and the police didn't pull away from that storeroom,

291
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,869
she couldn't take the sickle out of that storeroom.

292
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,969
But how did she crack the balloons that were decorated?

293
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,470
The water pistol!

294
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:29,269
Remember? Kohei said it smelled like the bathroom or detergent, right?

295
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,669
I think it was the smell of lemon or something.

296
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,069
Maybe she put the juice of the fruit in the water pistol and fired.

297
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,269
Because the rubber of balloons are melted

298
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,269
with the substance inside the juice of fruits.

299
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,769
The water pistol is also your late husband's belonging too, right?

300
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,769
Wasn't it in the storeroom together with the air gun?

301
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,770
Yes.

302
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:51,969
I think you've already forgotten

303
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,869
but my cheek was slashed by someone inside the storeroom!

304
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,569
And I wasn't standing near the light bulb when it cracked.

305
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,669
In the first place, as to the trick you just mentioned,

306
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,769
anybody other than I could've done it, no?

307
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,270
The chewing gum.

308
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,769
You stuck it onto the light bulb, didn't you?

309
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,169
By deliberately hitting your head against it, right?

310
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,069
Pretending to be annoyed.

311
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,469
The science teacher said that when something sticks onto old light bulbs

312
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,469
and there is a difference in the surface temperature, they crack easily!

313
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,469
And besides I think that the perp

314
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,869
slashed out using the light from Heiji's luminal wristwatch

315
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:35,769
and Pops Kogoro's cigarette light as a guide.

316
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,969
Why were you, who had nothing that gave off light on, get slashed?

317
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,969
That's...

318
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,769
Because you slashed yourself.

319
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,769
With the blade or something that you had embedded in your nail!

320
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,269
As to the blood that was on the nail,

321
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,669
if you touched your cheek that was slashed,

322
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,169
everybody would be deceived.

323
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,369
Besides, you're the one

324
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,569
who got everyone to go to the storeroom in the first place.

325
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,869
You did all this, made everyone believe that

326
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,669
Kamaitachi existed and had them call the police.

327
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,269
Then, you messed up the room that was decorated for the birthday party

328
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,769
using your air gun and water pistol

329
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,869
to get the police away from the storeroom.

330
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:15,269
After everyone gathered in front of the decorated room,

331
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,270
you played the scream of the Grand Master.

332
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,769
Played?

333
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,969
Yeah! She recorded the scream of the Grand Master

334
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,069
when the TV station came over on her smartphone or something

335
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,669
and set the time, then played it.

336
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,669
And to complete the scenario

337
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,669
while we used the back door to go to the annex,

338
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,769
she ran over the water and got to the annex before us,

339
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,269
where, she stabbed and killed the Grand Master with the sickle!

340
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,169
All she had to do after that was slash the paper door

341
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,069
and shutdown the breaker, and join us who got there later.

342
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,869
If the police were there at that time,

343
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,569
they would prove that she wouldn't have been able to

344
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,369
commit the crime.

345
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,869
Am I wrong somewhere?

346
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,369
Wrong or not, you've got no proof of anything like that!

347
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,570
Don't you normally wear contacts, Miss?

348
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:09,269
Because Takami said that you didn't wear glasses before.

349
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,069
When people who aren't used to, suddenly wear fake nails,

350
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,469
they mentioned on TV that wearing contacts is difficult.

351
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,969
Isn't that why you decided to wear glasses today?

352
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,369
In other words, it means that you usually don't wear fake nails.

353
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,869
So, you probably don't have spare nails on you, right?

354
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,569
Which means it should still be there,

355
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:37,370
the blood that got on it when you slashed Pops and me with it!

356
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,969
But why would you do that to Grand Master?

357
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,970
That chapped skin...

358
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,670
My mother had it too.

359
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,469
Because that Grand Master used to be hard on her.

360
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,869
Then, maybe that head waitstaff

361
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:00,369
that was fired by the Grand Master in the past was your...

362
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,569
Yes, that's right.

363
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,370
She was my mother!

364
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,069
My mother found another work place right away but...

365
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,069
The bad reputation that she was fired here spread,

366
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,270
so no other inns would hire her.

367
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,369
And in order to feed me, she had to suffer a lot

368
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,069
and died two years later.

369
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,569
But, why did he fire her?

370
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,169
Because there was talk of marriage

371
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,169
of the young master here who was intimate with my mother.

372
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,969
She was the only daughter of an inn

373
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,969
and if they got married, they could merge the two inns

374
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,569
and enlarge it.

375
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,869
Don't tell me that it's...

376
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,869
Right! If you weren't around,

377
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,869
my mother would never have had to go through such hard times!

378
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,370
You were one of my targets too!

379
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,769
But when I saw your chapped hands just like my mother had,

380
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,670
I decided against it.

381
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,869
Besides, I didn't want that boy

382
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,369
who was about to drown in the outdoor bath

383
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,570
to go through what I did either.

384
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,170
Which means that

385
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,169
you were the one who took a picture of that Kamaitachi

386
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,069
and sent it to the magazine company?

387
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,269
Yes. I wanted to experiment

388
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,969
whether I could really run over the water too, besides.

389
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,369
I thought that if the rumor of Kamaitachi went around,

390
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,969
people would stop coming to this outdoor bath

391
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,269
and I could work the trick out easier.

392
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,769
But, why Kamaitachi?

393
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,970
Because the start of her grudge was chapped skin, maybe?

394
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,069
The cause of Kamaitachi used to previously be thought that

395
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,069
the skin was slashed due to the vacuum

396
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,969
that was created in the center of the whirlwind,

397
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:41,069
but now it is said that the temperature of the surface of the skin

398
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,869
is cooled in an instant due to heat vaporization

399
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,369
and that causes the skin to break open.

400
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,170
That's why there are many Kamaitachi legends in snow countries.

401
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,270
I heard about it on a TV program on demons.

402
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,570
See.

403
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:20,969
I erased the audio data file like I promised.

404
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,369
"File deleted" -Thanks!

405
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,669
You're such a good boy, Conan!

406
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,870
Hattori.

407
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,369
I heard from Kazuha!

408
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,269
You said, "Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha?", right?

409
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:35,069
What, that again?

410
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:39,269
I didn't say 'my girl', I said darn it.

411
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,069
I said, "Darn it, what did you do to Kazuha?"

412
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,670
That's what I said!

413
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,369
After all, Kazuha is like a little sister to me.

414
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,669
My... darn it...

415
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,470
Well, that's the story!

416
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,969
-You idiot imbecile, Heiji! -Just what did you say?

417
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,969
-Kazuha? -It takes an idiot to know one.

418
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,469
Idiot...

419
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,470
Idiot Heiji!

420
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,269
In the first place,

421
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,769
Kudo gets to confess his love in front of the Big Ben in London.

422
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,169
So, how could I ever say that

423
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,869
I confessed to something as important as that

424
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,270
on the Ebisu Bridge, idiot?

425
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,769
Oh, by the way, as to that audio data.

426
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,970
The members of the Detective Squad dubbed it and have it too.

427
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,270
Haibara is using it as her ringtone.

428
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,569
Ringtone?

429
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,370
Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha?

430
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,270
Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha?

431
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,470
Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha?

432
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,069
I'm Bishamonten.

433
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,869
The woodpecker strategy, Ran!

434
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,070
One-eyed?

435
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,069
Wipe out the woodpecker.

436
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,969
Don't you know?

437
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,069
They said that you may have to shoot them.

438
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,970
Don't tell me... he is really...

439
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,070
I am the god of war.

440
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,269
Next Conan,

441
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,170
"The Darkness of the Prefectural Police (Part 1)"
