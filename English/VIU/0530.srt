1
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,610
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

2
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,910
Saturday nights are for mystery.

3
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,610
The urban legend that everyone is concerned about.

4
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,010
Women with long hair, beware.

5
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,610
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,510
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,210
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,937
"The Truth of the Urban Legend (Part 1)".

9
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,340
What's up, Mister?

10
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,240
Are you looking for something?

11
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:19,524
Hey, hey.

12
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:21,424
Wait up.

13
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:23,924
You don't need to run from me.

14
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:42,124
Hey, Ran. Do you know?

15
00:03:42,124 --> 00:03:43,524
About Hammer man?

16
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,624
I do! I do!

17
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:47,624
I saw it on the morning news.

18
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:51,224
I hear he appeared in a park near here last night!

19
00:03:51,224 --> 00:03:54,824
Yep, he's said to be tall and over 180 centimeters.

20
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:56,024
And his targets

21
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:59,124
all seem to be women with long hair in all four cases.

22
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:02,224
Yes, just like you, Ran.

23
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:03,824
Stop it, Sonoko!

24
00:04:04,924 --> 00:04:07,324
Well, but you would counterattack the Hammer man

25
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:09,624
with your Karate that you excel in though, Ran!

26
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,124
You can never tell

27
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:13,724
if he attacks out of the blue in the dark.

28
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:14,824
Really.

29
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:16,224
He's a real enemy of women!

30
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:19,624
I'm sure the police will arrest him in time.

31
00:04:23,224 --> 00:04:25,024
Talk of the devil,

32
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:27,824
there's Officer Takagi and Officer Sato.

33
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:29,924
Right.

34
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:31,424
Let's go ask them about

35
00:04:31,424 --> 00:04:32,824
how far they've investigated on the Hammer man!

36
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:33,924
Hold it!

37
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:40,624
I...

38
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:42,924
I couldn't hear you very well.

39
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:45,224
Then, let me say it again.

40
00:04:46,624 --> 00:04:47,724
Kiss me.

41
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:52,124
Right now. A very passionate one.

42
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:54,124
What? Wait.

43
00:04:55,724 --> 00:04:57,424
Come on, quickly!

44
00:04:57,424 --> 00:04:59,024
Stop dilly-dallying.

45
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:01,324
Yes!

46
00:05:03,324 --> 00:05:05,624
Then...

47
00:05:05,624 --> 00:05:07,424
excuse me.

48
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:08,724
Stake out?

49
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:12,524
Right?

50
00:05:13,624 --> 00:05:15,324
You idiot! How dare you intrude on them!

51
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:17,124
The best was just about to come and yet!

52
00:05:19,024 --> 00:05:21,524
But Officer Sato and Takagi were

53
00:05:21,524 --> 00:05:24,824
glaring at that condo for quite some time with scary looks on their faces.

54
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,924
After taking a good look,

55
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:27,724
I saw the figure of a person from the room on the third floor of that condo

56
00:05:27,724 --> 00:05:30,524
through the curtains,

57
00:05:30,524 --> 00:05:33,124
then, I saw Officer Sato suddenly put her arm

58
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,324
around Officer Takagi's neck,

59
00:05:35,324 --> 00:05:39,724
so I thought that you suddenly pretended to be lovers

60
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:44,224
so that no one would notice that you were staking out.

61
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:46,924
-Am I wrong? -That's right!

62
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:48,524
Amazing, you figured it out!

63
00:05:48,524 --> 00:05:51,224
So... so that's what it was.

64
00:05:51,224 --> 00:05:53,924
What did you think it was?

65
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:55,124
Nothing.

66
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:58,124
If you were staking out, the more I'm sorry

67
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,724
for Conan intruding on you.

68
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:02,224
No problem at all.

69
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:05,024
He rather, helped us.

70
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:06,324
Helped you?

71
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:10,224
Because it's hard to believe that we're staking out accompanied by

72
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:13,524
girl high school students and an elementary school child, right?

73
00:06:13,524 --> 00:06:15,624
That goes for Hammer man too.

74
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,124
Hammer man?

75
00:06:19,624 --> 00:06:21,824
Didn't you see it on the news?

76
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:25,624
That Hammer man was witnessed somewhere near here last night.

77
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:26,824
Oh, yes.

78
00:06:26,824 --> 00:06:28,324
On TV this morning.

79
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:31,224
The fact is that witness...

80
00:06:37,124 --> 00:06:42,224
went after Hammer man after seeing him.

81
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:54,024
And he saw Hammer man goes into this condo.

82
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:59,724
We got a report of this and came here right away, you see.

83
00:06:59,724 --> 00:07:01,824
We checked each room

84
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:04,524
and found that almost all the residents have an alibi.

85
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,924
And the only room with someone although apparently inside,

86
00:07:06,924 --> 00:07:11,424
that we got no answer from, despite ringing the doorbell

87
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:15,724
was the room in the center on the third floor over there!

88
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:18,424
Then, why don't you just raid the room

89
00:07:18,424 --> 00:07:20,224
after getting the spare key from the landlord?

90
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:23,624
We can't, we don't have a warrant.

91
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:25,724
But is the person in the room

92
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:27,724
really the Hammer man?

93
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:31,624
Maybe he just imitated the Hammer man and...

94
00:07:31,624 --> 00:07:33,724
He's no imitator.

95
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:37,724
That man was called by the witness and...

96
00:07:45,624 --> 00:07:47,224
What's up, Mister?

97
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:49,024
Are you looking for something?

98
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:54,924
He forgot the blood-smeared hammer

99
00:07:54,924 --> 00:07:56,924
when he rushed to flee.

100
00:07:58,324 --> 00:07:59,724
The same hammer that also had

101
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:02,424
the blood of the victims of the three previous cases too!

102
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:05,824
But it's amazing how that eye-witness caught up with the culprit.

103
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:08,324
Yeah, being that the Hammer man is said

104
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:11,624
to run 100 meters in 11 seconds.

105
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,624
That's just urban legend!

106
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:16,424
I've heard that he's actually not that fast.

107
00:08:16,424 --> 00:08:17,824
Because after all,

108
00:08:17,824 --> 00:08:20,124
that man is said to have been able to pursue the Hammer man

109
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,024
despite being drunk.

110
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:24,524
But if you know where his room is,

111
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:26,824
you can also tell who lives there, right?

112
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:28,224
The thing is,

113
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:29,724
the person who lives in that room

114
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:33,124
is a backpacker who is currently travelling abroad.

115
00:08:33,124 --> 00:08:37,024
The parents of the resident of that room said on the phone

116
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:39,924
that their son would be lending the room to a friend of his for a while.

117
00:08:39,924 --> 00:08:43,024
You don't know who that man is?

118
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,324
Well, according to his next-door neighbor,

119
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:51,424
he seems to have been living there together with his girlfriend previously,

120
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:54,524
but it seems that his girlfriend recently hasn't been coming around,

121
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:59,424
and the only time he is seen going out is at night.

122
00:08:59,424 --> 00:09:02,224
He seems to always be wearing a cap or hood.

123
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:05,024
It seems he doesn't clearly remember what the man looks like though.

124
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:06,524
Officer Sato and Takagi.

125
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:09,724
Officer Chiba.

126
00:09:11,624 --> 00:09:14,824
What? You used to go to that room?

127
00:09:14,824 --> 00:09:16,024
Who are they?

128
00:09:16,024 --> 00:09:21,024
Well, we were staking the entrance of the condo from some distance

129
00:09:21,024 --> 00:09:25,424
and saw these three go into and come out of the room in question.

130
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:27,724
They went in one after the other at ten-minute intervals.

131
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:30,824
You already told Inspector Megure about them, didn't you?

132
00:09:30,824 --> 00:09:31,824
Yes, Ma'am.

133
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:35,324
And what were the three doing in the room?

134
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,424
Doing what?

135
00:09:36,424 --> 00:09:39,324
I just went to pick up the package that I was told to come

136
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:42,324
and get on the phone.

137
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:45,024
I came to pick up a package

138
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:47,924
that I was told to come get by motorbike too.

139
00:09:47,924 --> 00:09:51,624
I came to deliver pizza.

140
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:55,924
Then, did all three of you see the resident of the room?

141
00:09:55,924 --> 00:09:58,924
No, I didn't see him.

142
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:02,024
There was a piece of paper posted below the entrance.

143
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:03,924
It said that he was in bed with a cold,

144
00:10:03,924 --> 00:10:09,024
so to just come in and take the cardboard box that was on the table.

145
00:10:10,624 --> 00:10:12,824
The voucher was written

146
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:15,624
and the money was in an envelope on the box.

147
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:18,724
I see. What about you?

148
00:10:18,724 --> 00:10:21,024
I didn't see him either.

149
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:22,024
Instructions for what I should do

150
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:25,024
was also written on the paper by the entrance.

151
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:30,824
It said that I was to take the bag that is on the table.

152
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:33,224
I got the address where I was to deliver the item

153
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:34,824
at the time he gave us a call.

154
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:39,624
The pizza delivery was also written on that paper.

155
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:40,924
It said the payment for the pizza

156
00:10:40,924 --> 00:10:43,824
is inside the envelope on the table, so to take it.

157
00:10:43,824 --> 00:10:47,624
And to leave the pizza on the table.

158
00:10:47,624 --> 00:10:49,224
I'm pretty sure that's what was written.

159
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:51,724
In bed with a cold?

160
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:57,224
Yeah, the voice I heard when he called was hoarse.

161
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,524
Same here.

162
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,024
Me too.

163
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:03,824
But I wonder why he called people one after the other to his room.

164
00:11:03,824 --> 00:11:06,324
There were two others besides you

165
00:11:06,324 --> 00:11:09,024
who were staking the entrance, weren't there?

166
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:11,624
Yes, the other two officers

167
00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:14,124
went to stop the courier and the motorbike courier.

168
00:11:14,124 --> 00:11:16,924
I stopped the pizza delivery man who arrived last.

169
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:20,924
You mean that there are no officers watching the entrance now?

170
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:25,824
Officer Chiba! Take care of them, will you?

171
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:27,124
Okay.

172
00:11:27,124 --> 00:11:29,324
The more people he calls over to the room,

173
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:33,924
each time the police has no choice but to stop the person

174
00:11:33,924 --> 00:11:36,124
and ask him what he came to the condo for!

175
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:38,124
Moreover, if the officer who goes after the person

176
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:42,024
is the one who actually saw that person, it would be perfect!

177
00:11:42,024 --> 00:11:43,224
He schemed to flee

178
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:45,924
while he used his strategy to decrease the number of officers

179
00:11:45,924 --> 00:11:48,024
who were staking out the condo!

180
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:52,424
A memo in front of the door.

181
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,624
The pizza is untouched.

182
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,524
He ordered the pizza in order to flee after all.

183
00:12:10,424 --> 00:12:11,624
Officer Sato.

184
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:15,124
Right after Officer Chiba went after the pizza delivery man to stop him,

185
00:12:15,124 --> 00:12:17,024
the officer that went to stop

186
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:19,324
the first delivery person that came, also returned,

187
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:21,424
and took over watching in Officer Chiba's place,

188
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:24,824
but says that no one left the room.

189
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:26,024
It can't be.

190
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:28,824
Then, it means that Hammer man is still inside the room.

191
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:32,124
Could it be that he's waiting to ambush us?

192
00:12:32,124 --> 00:12:33,424
No.

193
00:12:33,424 --> 00:12:36,224
I don't think he had any intention

194
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:37,924
to ambush anybody.

195
00:12:42,324 --> 00:12:43,824
Suicide?

196
00:12:43,824 --> 00:12:46,524
It seems that he's still breathing, though.

197
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:48,324
Officer Takagi, get an ambulance!

198
00:12:48,324 --> 00:12:49,524
Yes!

199
00:12:50,624 --> 00:12:51,924
I see.

200
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:53,724
He had prepared a coat and hat

201
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:56,424
so that he could flee,

202
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:58,824
but after figuring that he couldn't possibly flee,

203
00:12:58,824 --> 00:13:01,224
he decided to kill himself.

204
00:13:01,224 --> 00:13:04,524
But before he could complete what he set off to do,

205
00:13:04,524 --> 00:13:06,024
the rope came off

206
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:08,924
and he fell to the floor passed out.

207
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:10,624
I don't think he committed suicide.

208
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:15,424
See, look at his neck.

209
00:13:15,424 --> 00:13:18,124
There's practically no trace of the rope around his neck.

210
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:21,324
You... you're right.

211
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:23,324
Besides, his hat.

212
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:25,724
I don't think that a person who has his mind set on committing suicide

213
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:26,924
would wear a hat

214
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:30,424
that would get in the way of putting the rope around his neck.

215
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:32,824
Then, why the hat?

216
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:38,624
This... this is...

217
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:40,024
Just what does this mean?

218
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:44,924
Hammer man was struck

219
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:49,324
by one of the three people who came to this room!

220
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:00,665
Officer Chiba?

221
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:01,965
Just a while ago, there were three people

222
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:04,965
who went in and out of Hammer man's room, weren't there?

223
00:14:04,965 --> 00:14:06,065
Yes.

224
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:08,765
Will you please bring those three here?

225
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,865
I have something I want to ask them.

226
00:14:10,865 --> 00:14:14,865
But since all three of them seemed busy,

227
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:18,565
and asked to be interrogated after work,

228
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:20,865
I let them go just a while ago.

229
00:14:22,265 --> 00:14:24,065
What?

230
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:25,765
Hey, hey.

231
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:30,765
Then, what you are saying is

232
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:33,865
while you were staking out Hammer man's room,

233
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:36,965
three people went in and out of the room.

234
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:40,165
You thought that Hammer man summoned these three people

235
00:14:40,165 --> 00:14:42,865
to use them as a strategy to help Hammer man flee,

236
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:44,965
and busted into this room,

237
00:14:44,965 --> 00:14:47,265
but you ended up finding Hammer man on the floor

238
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:48,765
after being struck by someone,

239
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:51,365
unconscious and in critical condition.

240
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:53,065
Judging from the circumstances,

241
00:14:53,065 --> 00:14:56,365
the one who struck him has to be one of the three.

242
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:59,565
But since you never imagined this to be happening,

243
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,665
you very politely let the three go home.

244
00:15:03,665 --> 00:15:05,665
Am I correct?

245
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:07,465
-Yes. -Yes.

246
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:10,065
-Well... -You...

247
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:12,065
idiots!

248
00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:15,565
Just how many years have you been working as police detectives?

249
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:19,665
We have no word of apology for our carelessness...

250
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:24,065
And? What were the characters of the three people?

251
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:27,065
Yes. Well...

252
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:28,965
They were a courier,

253
00:15:28,965 --> 00:15:30,365
a motorbike delivery person,

254
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:32,165
and a pizza delivery man.

255
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,965
Conan?

256
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:37,165
Well, we just happened to run into him.

257
00:15:37,165 --> 00:15:38,665
I'm pretty sure that

258
00:15:38,665 --> 00:15:43,865
the courier was a tall man who was more than 180 centimeters.

259
00:15:43,865 --> 00:15:45,365
The motorbike person was

260
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:49,065
a woman, a small person less than 160 centimeters.

261
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:51,065
And the pizza delivery man

262
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:54,265
was a thin person about 170 centimeters tall.

263
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:58,265
Conan is a lot more dependable than all of you.

264
00:15:58,265 --> 00:16:00,965
Like always.

265
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:01,965
Right?

266
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:06,965
But why on earth did the culprit strike Hammer man?

267
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,165
It's most likely

268
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:11,265
that a person connected to one of the victims of the four assault cases

269
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:13,865
committed by Hammer man

270
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:16,365
held a grudge against him and did it.

271
00:16:16,365 --> 00:16:18,565
Although no one has died yet,

272
00:16:18,565 --> 00:16:21,965
all four victims were inflicted serious injuries.

273
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:23,265
In other words,

274
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,265
the culprit found out through the news

275
00:16:25,265 --> 00:16:26,965
that an incident occurred in this vicinity,

276
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:29,165
and set his target on this condo where he witnessed officers

277
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:31,265
that seemed to be staking out,

278
00:16:31,265 --> 00:16:32,865
disguised himself as someone

279
00:16:32,865 --> 00:16:35,465
who wouldn't be suspected of going in and out of the room,

280
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:37,265
and struck Hammer man.

281
00:16:37,265 --> 00:16:39,265
That's the story.

282
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:42,965
But why'd you let them go without even asking for their names?

283
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:45,065
Oh, well...

284
00:16:45,065 --> 00:16:47,765
because all three said that they left invoices in the room,

285
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:49,865
with their names as well as their company names on them,

286
00:16:49,865 --> 00:16:51,765
if they needed to be contacted.

287
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:54,265
The only invoice found was that of the pizza shop.

288
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:55,965
What? No joke.

289
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:58,365
Hey, Chiba.

290
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:03,265
But we have the invoice from the pizza shop,

291
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:04,965
so we could

292
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:08,065
call the shop and find out if he's the culprit or not.

293
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:13,665
Huh? He hasn't returned?

294
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:14,865
You mean the person who went out to make the delivery

295
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:16,565
hasn't come back yet?

296
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:20,065
No, he left about 40 minutes ago

297
00:17:20,065 --> 00:17:23,565
after receiving a phone order from that condo.

298
00:17:23,565 --> 00:17:26,665
It's already about time that he should be back.

299
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:29,565
Did something happen to our part-time worker, officer?

300
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:31,365
Oh, no.

301
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:33,965
If so, it could be that

302
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:36,865
the culprit pretended to be the resident of the room,

303
00:17:36,865 --> 00:17:39,165
and placed an order for pizza delivery,

304
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:42,665
kidnapped the delivery person who came along,

305
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:44,365
took the clothes off the delivery man

306
00:17:44,365 --> 00:17:46,165
and in turn disguised himself as the delivery man

307
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,765
and broke into this room?

308
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:51,565
If so,

309
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:54,965
did the courier and motorbike delivery just happen to come by?

310
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:57,765
It could've been camouflage.

311
00:17:57,765 --> 00:18:01,065
Just the pizza delivery man coming would be too conspicuous.

312
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:02,165
Besides, all three said

313
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:06,265
that the voice of the man on the line was hoarse.

314
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:08,265
It could be that the culprit did so deliberately

315
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:10,665
because he didn't want his voice to be identified.

316
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:13,265
The pizza delivery man who arrived there last

317
00:18:13,265 --> 00:18:15,665
could've crumpled the invoices of the courier and the motorbike delivery

318
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:17,265
that came after him.

319
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:20,465
But isn't it strange?

320
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:24,265
Because when the first courier came,

321
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:25,865
there was a note in front of the door that said,

322
00:18:25,865 --> 00:18:31,665
"I'm in bed with a cold, so go ahead and do what you have to".

323
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:33,065
So, he went ahead into the room, just as was written

324
00:18:33,065 --> 00:18:35,565
and took the parcel with him, right?

325
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:38,365
If the pizza delivery man came last,

326
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:41,265
I don't think he could've put the note there.

327
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:42,665
True,

328
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:43,665
the only one who could've put it there,

329
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:46,465
would've been the courier who got there first.

330
00:18:46,465 --> 00:18:49,565
In other words, the culprit didn't come to get the parcel,

331
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:51,165
but rather, feigned to have come to make a delivery,

332
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:53,365
forced himself into the room,

333
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,765
knocked Hammer man down,

334
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:57,265
and when leaving the room,

335
00:18:57,265 --> 00:19:00,265
left that note behind to lure the motorbike delivery person

336
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:03,065
and pizza delivery man into the room.

337
00:19:03,065 --> 00:19:06,265
And set it up so that he alone wouldn't be suspected.

338
00:19:06,265 --> 00:19:09,165
But if so, the invoice of the motorbike person

339
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:11,465
should've been found in the room.

340
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:14,965
The ones who can hide the invoices of the courier

341
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:16,865
and the motorbike delivery person

342
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:20,365
are either the motorbike delivery person or the pizza delivery man, so...

343
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:23,365
But if the pizza delivery man is the culprit,

344
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:26,365
why did he leave his own invoice behind?

345
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,365
The one who can get rid of the invoice for the pizza that came last

346
00:19:29,365 --> 00:19:31,065
is the man who delivered the pizza,

347
00:19:31,065 --> 00:19:33,665
so maybe he deliberately left it behind.

348
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:35,065
I see.

349
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:39,065
Which of the three is the culprit?

350
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:44,565
At any rate,

351
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:47,865
let's leave looking for the three to the other officers,

352
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:50,165
and investigate this room!

353
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:56,765
You haven't found any definite evidence yet that Hammer man

354
00:19:56,765 --> 00:19:58,365
is really a resident of this room, have you?

355
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,465
True.

356
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:04,065
Okay! Search each nook and cranny!

357
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:05,465
-Yes, Sir! -Yes, Sir!

358
00:20:12,265 --> 00:20:13,765
Say, Officer Takagi.

359
00:20:13,765 --> 00:20:16,065
-Did you find anything? -No.

360
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:18,465
Not anything worth mentioning.

361
00:20:18,465 --> 00:20:23,265
Only that this toilet and bathtub were used very cleanly.

362
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,965
Don't you think it's too clean?

363
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:28,665
Because, see, take a look.

364
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:31,765
The dining room is quite messy,

365
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:35,165
and yet the toilet and bathtub being spic-and-span is strange.

366
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:39,165
Besides, the electric shaver that is on the washbasin...

367
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:41,265
Electric shaver?

368
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:45,265
Although it's the chargeable kind, it's not plugged in.

369
00:20:45,265 --> 00:20:48,165
It's strange that although there is a shampoo bottle, soap and toothpaste,

370
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:51,165
there is no toothbrush.

371
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:53,065
True.

372
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:55,665
Something's really not right.

373
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:58,165
Something's really strange after all!

374
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:01,565
Because the drain of the bathtub...

375
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:05,265
There is no hair or anything else stuck inside!

376
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,365
No way!

377
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,565
Really?

378
00:21:19,465 --> 00:21:22,265
I... I'm sorry.

379
00:21:22,265 --> 00:21:24,565
I seemed to have tripped.

380
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:26,165
Oh, no.

381
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:27,565
Excuse me.

382
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:38,665
The drain, was it?

383
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:39,865
Let's see.

384
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:45,365
It's strange after all.

385
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:48,265
Why has only the bathroom been cleaned thoroughly?

386
00:21:53,165 --> 00:21:54,865
Kiss me.

387
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:58,765
Right now. A very passionate one.

388
00:21:58,765 --> 00:22:00,165
Come on, quickly!

389
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:01,665
Stop dilly-dallying.

390
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:06,265
Inspector Megure!

391
00:22:08,165 --> 00:22:10,065
We found gloves with blood on them!

392
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,565
Where'd you find it?

393
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,065
Over here!

394
00:22:15,065 --> 00:22:17,965
When we checked inside the dryer and washing machine,

395
00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:21,565
we found these gloves among the laundry.

396
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:27,565
Is the man who was found lying on the floor of this room Hammer man?

397
00:22:27,565 --> 00:22:31,965
And is one of the three people who came to this room,

398
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:34,865
the one who attacked Hammer man?

399
00:23:57,065 --> 00:23:59,265
"Next Episode" -Chiba, you staked out with Officer Sato

400
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:01,265
in the past, didn't you?

401
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:05,165
I could never forget that soft touch.

402
00:24:05,165 --> 00:24:07,565
What?

403
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:09,765
He wasn't here to begin with.

404
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:11,665
The man called Hammer man.

405
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:14,765
Sonoko?

406
00:24:14,765 --> 00:24:17,865
That queer dance...

407
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:21,565
We were dancing around.

408
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:22,965
Next Conan,

409
00:24:22,965 --> 00:24:26,965
"The Truth of the Urban Legend (Part 2)".

410
00:24:42,865 --> 00:24:44,665
Next Conan's Hint:

411
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:46,965
"Shift pad".

412
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:48,365
This time for sure, I'm going to make it with Ms. Sato.

413
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:49,665
Please don't get in my way, okay, Conan?

414
00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:51,865
I wonder about that.
