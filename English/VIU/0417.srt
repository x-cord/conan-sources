1
00:00:00,508 --> 00:00:02,107
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:02,108 --> 00:00:04,207
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:06,107
Today's story is the climax of the Butsumetsu mystery.

4
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:07,407
Ran's casual remark helps clear-up the mystery!

5
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:09,507
It rings a bell to something that was almost overlooked!

6
00:00:09,508 --> 00:00:11,107
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:13,007
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:15,308
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:59,628
We were invited to a wealthy person's residence in Shizuoka prefecture.

10
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:01,028
At that residence,

11
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:02,228
for the past few years,

12
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:05,929
on the 4th of Butsumetsu, a phenomenon was always said to occur.

13
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:09,928
And on October 4th,

14
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,428
there were two victims in the house.

15
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:15,829
What? Fingerprints were detected from the rope and medicine bottle?

16
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:20,528
And? Whose fingerprints did it match?

17
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:23,428
Well...

18
00:02:23,429 --> 00:02:26,928
It doesn't match anyone who works in this house.

19
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:29,829
It's an unknown fingerprint.

20
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:37,228
"The Evil Spirit that Appears on Butsumetsu (Solution)"

21
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:40,228
Then we know it's an outsider who did it.

22
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:43,728
Can we go back to our rooms and rest?

23
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:48,528
Yes. A policeman will be right outside each of your rooms,

24
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:49,929
but please get some rest.

25
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:58,028
Hey, where does Mr. Sekiguchi live and what does he do?

26
00:02:58,029 --> 00:03:00,428
His company is...

27
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:01,728
Mr. Watabiki?

28
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:03,728
Yes.

29
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:07,728
It's Sekiguchi Securities at Umeki City, Nishi-ku, Yokohama.

30
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,228
Detailed, aren't you?

31
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:13,728
I go to pick Mr. Sekiguchi up whenever he comes here.

32
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:15,528
He's memo crazy.

33
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,628
Memo crazy?

34
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,028
By the way, wasn't it in Yokohama that...

35
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:22,128
Yes, my brother.

36
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:25,128
What is it, brother? At this time of night!

37
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:27,828
Toshimichi Sekiguchi? Yes, I know him.

38
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:30,228
I met him a few times when he was still a newcomer.

39
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:33,528
I remember him well because I didn't like him.

40
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:35,028
So what's with him?

41
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:39,728
He was found hanging from a rope at Kunitomo's residence.

42
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:42,328
What? He committed suicide?

43
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:45,328
He might have been murdered.

44
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,328
After that, it seems like someone also killed the owner of the residence.

45
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:54,828
Well, I met the guy when the company president's family

46
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,328
filed a missing person report.

47
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,028
Missing person report?

48
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:02,728
Yes. The president suddenly disappeared!

49
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:06,028
He still hasn't returned after 13 years.

50
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:08,129
13 years?

51
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:13,328
It was the end of September 13 years ago.

52
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:16,128
It was on mother's birthday.

53
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:19,528
Which means that 13 years ago on September 26th,

54
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,828
the president disappeared?

55
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,228
If I'm not mistaken, the ship sunk at Suruga Bay

56
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,828
13 years ago on September 29th.

57
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:29,228
3 days before...

58
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:32,928
And that Sekiguchi stepped in to take his place.

59
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:34,228
Inspector!

60
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:35,628
Let's go for a few drinks after work.

61
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:37,628
Okay, but let's split the bill!

62
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:40,128
Hey, why don't you treat him once in a while?

63
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:42,328
You're so stingy.

64
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:45,728
Call me an economical person! See you!

65
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:51,428
Stingy people living here must also have some peculiar habits or symptoms.

66
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:55,028
You all look tired so why don't all of you get some rest, Mr. Mouri?

67
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,228
Yes, I think we'll do that.

68
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,728
Hey, before you go to sleep,

69
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:00,628
let's check up on the people in their bedrooms.

70
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:02,828
Let's check if the habits and symptoms they were talking about

71
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:05,229
are real or not!

72
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:10,128
You want to know why I have belonephobia?

73
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:13,128
When I was a child, I took my mother's sewing box,

74
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:16,628
it fell and a needle poked onto my forehead.

75
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:18,728
That must have hurt.

76
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:19,828
Huh?

77
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:23,328
Is that why the calendar is stuck on the wall with tape?

78
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:25,528
Yes.

79
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:27,629
There are some marks on the calendar.

80
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:34,228
It's the birthdays of myself, my daughter, Mr. Akatsuka and Mr. Watabiki.

81
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:38,628
My husband, Mr. Watabiki's father, and Mr. Akatsugi's wife

82
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:42,128
who died in the ship accident were all classmates from grade school

83
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:46,128
and we always celebrated our birthdays together.

84
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:51,828
Before Mr. Watabiki's mother passed away, there were eight marks.

85
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:53,229
It has become half of that now.

86
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:59,228
If you want to know about my fear for heights,

87
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:02,328
you'd better ask Mr. Akatsuka and Mr. Watabiki.

88
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:06,028
You fell from a high place because of them?

89
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:07,428
It's the opposite!

90
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:09,328
When I was in 4th grade,

91
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:13,028
when I fell from a tree, Watabiki saved me from the fall.

92
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:14,828
And that time, the left hand...

93
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:16,728
Then you must have been hurt real bad?

94
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:18,128
No.

95
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,428
Actually, it was Watabiki who got hurt.

96
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:21,528
A year or two ago,

97
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:25,528
I had completely forgotten until I saw the scar on his hand.

98
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:28,628
He's obsessed with cleanliness and always wears gloves.

99
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:36,328
I always thought it was his younger brother that saved me.

100
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,328
The room is so clean.

101
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:42,728
Of course! Chefs are supposed to be clean.

102
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:43,729
I guess that's right.

103
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,828
Hey! Don't come into girl's room without permission!

104
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:47,829
Excuse me!

105
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:52,428
This is the scar from back then.

106
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:53,528
So what's the problem?

107
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:56,828
You wear gloves inside your room, too.

108
00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:01,728
Yes. Except during bath time and when I had my fingerprints taken.

109
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:05,729
And I also take them off when I drive and write.

110
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:09,928
These are the gloves your younger brother used.

111
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,928
But my brother used them when he was a kid.

112
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:16,528
I don't see the older brother's gloves.

113
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:19,729
Unlike my younger brother, I am not a sportsman.

114
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:22,228
Really?

115
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:23,528
Huh?

116
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:26,428
Your calendar also has a lot of marks.

117
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:27,628
Yes.

118
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:31,428
I once forgot my master's business.

119
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:34,628
Ever since then, I write things down.

120
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:39,228
What? How did I became a perfectionist?

121
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:41,628
Do I need to have a reason?

122
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,028
You're absolutely right.

123
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,328
It seems like your tidiness is for real.

124
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:49,428
Everything in this room is straight and tidy.

125
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:52,128
I can't settle down until I do so.

126
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:55,028
Hey, is there someone who is just the opposite?

127
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:57,128
Not really sloppy, but...

128
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:59,528
Shigeko seems to be a little sloppy.

129
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:04,628
The way she piles the plates up is always three millimetres off.

130
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:09,028
Watabiki and Namika are always precise.

131
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,428
What's this?

132
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:12,628
Is this compass yours?

133
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,828
Yes, I like to hike to the mountains.

134
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:19,328
Hey, did you notice the letters engraved in Mr. Sekiguchi's watch?

135
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:20,428
What?

136
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:23,328
Right, wasn't it "E" and "N"?

137
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:26,228
But isn't it weird? If it's the same as this compass,

138
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:28,529
the position of the "N" and "E" was wrong, wasn't it?

139
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:30,928
I wonder why?

140
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:32,628
I don't know!

141
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:35,728
Well, we went around the four rooms.

142
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:38,528
We didn't find anything suspicious, did we?

143
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:41,929
This kid just took us for a ride!

144
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:46,628
Well, let's continue with the investigation after a little rest.

145
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,028
Yes, let's do that.

146
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:51,328
I wonder what it is. Something's not right.

147
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:53,528
I feel like I must've overlooked something.

148
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:56,528
It doesn't feel right. What is it?

149
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:58,128
Hey, Conan.

150
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:01,128
I bought you new pyjamas, do you want to wear it tonight?

151
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:03,128
It's a matching outfit with mine.

152
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:04,828
Huh?

153
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:05,929
Matching outfit?

154
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:11,728
I see. I must have overlooked this possibility.

155
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:16,528
If that is the truth, the factitive method of Sekiguchi's murder,

156
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:19,628
the method used to go through the fingerprint identification machine,

157
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:21,928
the mystery of the killer's disappearance from the third floor,

158
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,728
the reason why the master was surprised enough to have a fit,

159
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:27,028
this will explain it all!

160
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:29,528
-Well done. -Hey!

161
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,728
Mr. Kogoro asked to have the four people and the wife

162
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:34,628
to assemble on the third floor.

163
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:38,128
What? Does Mr. Mouri know who the culprit is?

164
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:40,028
Yes, I think so.

165
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,528
He said the culprit is still here,

166
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:43,628
so please don't let him escape.

167
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:47,028
That's great! He's going to start the deduction show!

168
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:50,128
Not right now, but in about three hours later.

169
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,928
What? Three hours later?

170
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:53,228
Yes, of course.

171
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:58,329
Only if Inspector Yokomizo listens and does what he says.

172
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:01,929
Yes, certainly.

173
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:09,931
What is it? It's so early in the morning.

174
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:15,331
Let me explain the truth of the two murders that took place here.

175
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:19,931
And that the culprit is among you.

176
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:23,831
First of all, the murder of Mr. Sekiguchi which is the first case.

177
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:28,031
But didn't you say that it was an outsiders doing?

178
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:29,032
Yes, that's right.

179
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:30,032
That's true.

180
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:34,631
Namika who is afraid of heights couldn't have hung anybody

181
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:36,331
on the third floor's veranda.

182
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:38,731
Shigeko who has belonephobia

183
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:41,631
would have avoided places where sharp points such as the iron fencing.

184
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:43,831
The words that were written on the card

185
00:10:43,832 --> 00:10:46,231
that the culprit is thought to have slipped into Sekiguchi's pocket.

186
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:48,031
The lettering was slanted.

187
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:52,331
A tidy and perfectionist Akatsuka would not have done that.

188
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:56,331
At the time of the crime, Watabiki and the master's wife

189
00:10:56,332 --> 00:10:57,931
who went to the hospital with the master,

190
00:10:57,932 --> 00:10:59,831
could not have committed the crime.

191
00:10:59,832 --> 00:11:01,131
Then who did it?

192
00:11:01,132 --> 00:11:06,431
You're not really saying that someone among us is faking it, are you?

193
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:10,431
No. Namika's room is clean,

194
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:13,031
but the area around the window was not.

195
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:14,731
This proves that you are afraid of heights

196
00:11:14,732 --> 00:11:17,031
because you cannot come close to the window.

197
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:21,631
Shigeko who has belonephobia uses tape to hang her calendar.

198
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:23,831
Even when we intruded Akatsuka's room unexpectedly,

199
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:27,331
the things in the room were tidy.

200
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:30,832
I think it is safe to say that no one is lying.

201
00:11:31,932 --> 00:11:34,531
Let's investigate the second crime.

202
00:11:34,532 --> 00:11:36,531
A person enters this bedroom on the third floor

203
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:39,131
by opening the door of the fingerprint identification machine

204
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,132
and slips through.

205
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,431
This person sets things up to cause the master to have a heart attack

206
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:43,731
that results in death

207
00:11:43,732 --> 00:11:47,631
and disappears without leaving any traces of having run away.

208
00:11:47,632 --> 00:11:49,531
The plausible explanation here

209
00:11:49,532 --> 00:11:52,031
is the getaway rope tied to the veranda.

210
00:11:52,032 --> 00:11:54,331
The culprit notices Conan climbing up the rope,

211
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:56,931
so the culprit withdrew from the room

212
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:59,431
and hide behind the fingerprint identification machine door.

213
00:11:59,432 --> 00:12:02,531
And managed to blend in with us without anyone noticing it.

214
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:04,232
This is possible.

215
00:12:05,332 --> 00:12:07,131
But wasn't that proven innocent

216
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:10,731
by the fingerprints on the medicine bottle and rope?

217
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:13,431
That is probably the fingerprints of the accomplice.

218
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,831
-Accomplice? -Accomplice?

219
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:18,831
Yes, there are two culprits!

220
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:24,631
Does that mean that someone amongst us brought someone suspicious with us?

221
00:12:24,632 --> 00:12:30,331
But the master said that he wasn't planning on meeting anyone today.

222
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,631
After all,

223
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:36,031
we all looked in every room on the third floor and we didn't find anyone!

224
00:12:36,032 --> 00:12:39,831
Well, no one suspicious turned up

225
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:43,831
and there was no trace of escape from the veranda nor the window.

226
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:45,831
Then where's the accomplice?

227
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,231
Yes, so...

228
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:50,031
I wanted to re-enact this with everyone

229
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:52,131
and that is why I asked you all to come here.

230
00:12:52,132 --> 00:12:55,531
I might have overlooked something.

231
00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:57,031
Okay, everyone!

232
00:12:57,032 --> 00:12:59,531
We are going to search the rooms one by one.

233
00:12:59,532 --> 00:13:03,731
Unlike then, I will enter the room last

234
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:08,231
in order to watch if anyone makes a suspicious move.

235
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:14,031
So would Watabiki play my role by entering first

236
00:13:14,032 --> 00:13:16,231
and inspecting the window and veranda?

237
00:13:16,232 --> 00:13:18,531
-Okay? -Sure!

238
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:23,231
So let's start with the library next to the bedroom.

239
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:26,931
And of course, if you see something or notice something,

240
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,531
please let me know!

241
00:13:29,532 --> 00:13:33,231
You don't have to shout. I can hear you clearly.

242
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:36,632
I'm sorry. I shout whenever I get excited.

243
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:39,431
Mr. Watabiki, please go in.

244
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:41,131
Yes.

245
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:45,131
The window is locked.

246
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:47,631
No one's on the veranda.

247
00:13:47,632 --> 00:13:49,731
May we also go in?

248
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:51,231
Yes, of course!

249
00:13:51,232 --> 00:13:54,331
Do you think we'll find something out this way?

250
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:56,231
Yes.

251
00:13:56,232 --> 00:13:58,131
Then, let's go to the next room.

252
00:13:58,132 --> 00:13:59,831
Everyone, please hurry.

253
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:02,131
No one suspicious came to the hallway.

254
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,632
Thank you, Conan!

255
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:06,431
Darn it.

256
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:08,532
Nothing turned up!

257
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:13,331
So if we're done, I'd like to get back to work!

258
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:16,631
Stop babbling and answer my questions.

259
00:14:16,632 --> 00:14:19,931
Are you really sure there was no one suspicious?

260
00:14:19,932 --> 00:14:22,032
Was someone there or not? Which is it?

261
00:14:23,432 --> 00:14:25,231
No one was there...

262
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:30,031
No, there was someone there in the room that you just searched.

263
00:14:30,032 --> 00:14:33,231
I just told you that no one was there!

264
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:37,232
Yes, there is. There's one more person behind Inspector Yokomizo.

265
00:14:40,932 --> 00:14:42,331
Twins...

266
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:46,831
Yes. He's my brother who works for the Kanagawa Prefectural Police.

267
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:48,131
Hi.

268
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:50,031
I'll be off then.

269
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:53,531
Don't tell my boss that I was in on this investigation.

270
00:14:53,532 --> 00:14:55,231
Right. Thanks.

271
00:14:55,232 --> 00:14:57,931
But why is twin the answer?

272
00:14:57,932 --> 00:15:00,231
In other words, it's like this...

273
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:04,431
When we were searching the room, the culprit stayed in the back,

274
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:07,931
making sure to do so when entering and leaving the room.

275
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:09,731
He acted as though he was leaving the room

276
00:15:09,732 --> 00:15:11,731
right before the one the accomplice was in,

277
00:15:11,732 --> 00:15:13,931
but he stayed there in the room right before the accomplice was hiding.

278
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:16,331
When Inspector Yokomizo finished searching the window

279
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,331
and you guys were waiting in order to enter the room,

280
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:24,031
the accomplice that was hiding behind the door joined everyone.

281
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:27,431
If the accomplice is a twin wearing the same clothes,

282
00:15:27,432 --> 00:15:30,131
switching places like Inspector Yokomizo did

283
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:31,531
no one would have noticed

284
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:35,531
nor would have been suspicious that somebody else was hiding.

285
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:36,631
But...

286
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:37,731
Where are they?

287
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:39,832
There are no twins here!

288
00:15:40,832 --> 00:15:44,631
Right. When Shigeko mentioned the story about everyone's birthdays,

289
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:46,131
something bothered me.

290
00:15:46,132 --> 00:15:49,931
20 years ago, there were Watabiki, his parents and his younger brother,

291
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:53,531
Shigeko and her husband and Namika as well as Akatsuka and his wife.

292
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:55,931
There were supposed to be a total of nine birthdays,

293
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:57,831
but she said there were only eight.

294
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:01,031
Which means someone had the same birthday.

295
00:16:01,032 --> 00:16:05,431
After hearing Namika fell off a tree when she was in fourth grade,

296
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,131
I was convinced.

297
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:11,931
She could just vaguely remember who saved her at that age

298
00:16:11,932 --> 00:16:15,931
is because there were two people that were alike.

299
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:16,932
In other words,

300
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:22,831
Watabiki, you conspired with your twin brother and committed this crime.

301
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:24,131
What are you talking about?

302
00:16:24,132 --> 00:16:27,731
His brother died in that accident 13 years ago!

303
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:30,131
What if he didn't die in that accident?

304
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:31,231
What?

305
00:16:31,232 --> 00:16:35,431
What if he swam to shore and survived?

306
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:39,031
To prove that, there is a scar on the palm of his left hand,

307
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:42,931
which he got when he saved Namika from her fall.

308
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:44,831
When he drove us here,

309
00:16:44,832 --> 00:16:49,631
there was no scar on his left hand.

310
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:53,531
The mark at the head of the words on the calendar in his room

311
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:55,831
were different depending on the date.

312
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:59,531
They probably switched places once in a while,

313
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:06,031
noting everything down and by using the same organizer,

314
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:08,731
they could become one and the same person.

315
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:10,131
They did it in preparation for today.

316
00:17:10,132 --> 00:17:13,531
In order to murder Mr. Sekiguchi and the master!

317
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,131
The younger brother took the two of them to the hospital

318
00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:18,531
to establish an alibi.

319
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:21,231
After that, the older brother who was hiding in the mansion

320
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:24,331
enters the third floor by making Sekiguchi open the door.

321
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:29,431
He choked Sekiguchi and hung him from the veranda railing.

322
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:33,431
And after a few hours, he goes to the third floor again

323
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:36,331
and murdered the master.

324
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:40,031
But master said he wasn't going to meet anyone.

325
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:42,831
The master will meet him

326
00:17:42,832 --> 00:17:46,431
especially if he was with the master when Sekiguchi was killed.

327
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:50,031
Since he would be the most unsuspicious person.

328
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:53,031
The master must have been surprised.

329
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:56,231
A man wearing the same clothes with the same face appears.

330
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:58,131
Furthermore, that is the same person who supposedly

331
00:17:58,132 --> 00:18:01,331
was said to have died 13 years ago.

332
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:03,531
You deliberately left your younger brother's fingerprints

333
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:05,831
on the medicine bottle and rope

334
00:18:05,832 --> 00:18:08,931
to make us believe it was of an unknown person is the culprit.

335
00:18:08,932 --> 00:18:10,731
This is to exclude the people inside the premise

336
00:18:10,732 --> 00:18:13,431
from the suspect list.

337
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:15,731
But where is the other one?

338
00:18:15,732 --> 00:18:18,031
He didn't turn up in the search, right?

339
00:18:18,032 --> 00:18:22,331
That is why I asked Mr. Watabiki to search the window

340
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:25,831
and gave you instructions in a loud voice.

341
00:18:25,832 --> 00:18:30,231
So that the accomplice who is hiding on the third floor can hear.

342
00:18:30,232 --> 00:18:32,832
I dropped him hints telling him that he'll be safe on the veranda!

343
00:18:34,632 --> 00:18:38,331
The police has surrounded the premise!

344
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:40,531
Please bring him in.

345
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:42,731
That won't be necessary.

346
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:44,431
Brother.

347
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:47,331
-Then you will admit to the crimes? -Yes.

348
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:50,531
Wait a minute! If you're alive...

349
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:51,831
What about my father?

350
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:52,832
What about my wife?

351
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,131
They probably died

352
00:18:55,132 --> 00:18:57,132
because they were abandoned by you-know-who.

353
00:18:58,832 --> 00:18:59,931
What is it?

354
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:03,431
What happened 13 years ago?

355
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:07,431
Something suddenly went wrong with the ship while cruising,

356
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:10,131
so I dived to check it out.

357
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:14,631
Someone's bag was tangled in the screw and helm.

358
00:19:14,632 --> 00:19:16,431
And inside it was somebody's hand.

359
00:19:16,432 --> 00:19:18,031
A human hand?

360
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:21,531
It was most probably the hand of the missing former president

361
00:19:21,532 --> 00:19:24,031
of Sekiguchi's company who disappeared 13 years ago.

362
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:28,831
He suddenly participated in the cruise to dump the body into the sea.

363
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:33,331
In other words, the fifth soul written on the first card

364
00:19:33,332 --> 00:19:36,231
was referred to him.

365
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:39,231
Did you know that he was going to dump the dead body?

366
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:41,431
No, I didn't know!

367
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:44,131
When I told everyone on the ship,

368
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:49,531
Sekiguchi suddenly shoved father away and speed the ship up.

369
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:52,031
Speeding without having control of the helm,

370
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:55,731
the ship turned over and everyone was tossed into the sea.

371
00:19:55,732 --> 00:19:58,931
Only the master and his wife escaped

372
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:01,931
with the only rubber raft that had air in it.

373
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:05,431
No! I was going to return to call for help.

374
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:07,131
But Sekiguchi...

375
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:09,231
They won't survive anyway!

376
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:10,931
Just keep quiet about this,

377
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:13,831
both of you are also an accomplice and abandoned them!

378
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:15,631
That's what he told me.

379
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,731
We were all holding on to a small float,

380
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:21,731
but thought that we would all die like this.

381
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:23,631
So the person with the most physical strength, me,

382
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:25,631
went to call for help.

383
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:27,932
But I felt consciousness slipping away.

384
00:20:29,132 --> 00:20:31,731
When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed

385
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,031
and I lost my memory.

386
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,531
I sneaked out of the hospital and wandered around.

387
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:38,131
Then in summer two years ago,

388
00:20:38,132 --> 00:20:39,931
I coincidently met my brother

389
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:42,831
and at the same time, my memory came back to me.

390
00:20:42,832 --> 00:20:44,931
I met my brother on the day

391
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:49,731
after I almost had a car accident with the master's car.

392
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:51,631
The accident was my fault,

393
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:54,431
but master was the one who kept on apologizing,

394
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:57,131
so I thought it a little weird.

395
00:20:57,132 --> 00:21:01,931
That night, when I heard my brother's tale, I understood why.

396
00:21:01,932 --> 00:21:04,931
Then the master's nightmare and the car accident

397
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:07,031
on the 4th of Butsumetsu was a coincidence?

398
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,131
Yes.

399
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:11,931
That's where we got the idea of taking revenge.

400
00:21:11,932 --> 00:21:16,131
There was no evidence left for the police anyway.

401
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:18,431
But if we can find the sunken ship...

402
00:21:18,432 --> 00:21:19,531
That's impossible!

403
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:21,731
It actually sank within the Suruga Bay,

404
00:21:21,732 --> 00:21:25,231
but he told the police it sank way out at sea.

405
00:21:25,232 --> 00:21:27,631
34 degrees north latitude 45 minutes,

406
00:21:27,632 --> 00:21:29,732
138 degrees east longitude 30 minutes.

407
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:35,331
Don't you guys remember? The "N" and "E" engraved on Mr. Sekiguchi's watch.

408
00:21:35,332 --> 00:21:37,531
"N" is north latitude 45 minutes,

409
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:39,831
"E" is east longitude 30 minutes!

410
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:40,832
If it's within Suruga Bay,

411
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,831
then it's approximately 34 degrees north latitude

412
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:44,632
and 138 degrees east longitude.

413
00:21:45,832 --> 00:21:48,531
That's probably where the ship sank.

414
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:50,631
So that's what it means.

415
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:53,031
But why on the 4th, the unlucky day?

416
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:56,831
The ship accident was on September 29, a lucky day.

417
00:21:56,832 --> 00:22:00,331
That's because 13 years ago this day,

418
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:02,531
October 4th was Butsumetsu.

419
00:22:02,532 --> 00:22:04,431
It was when the master went to the police

420
00:22:04,432 --> 00:22:06,932
to ask them to stop the investigation.

421
00:23:33,332 --> 00:23:36,031
After that, although the tide drifted it a little,

422
00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:38,531
the ship was somehow found

423
00:23:38,532 --> 00:23:42,231
with the bag in question still tangled in the screw.

424
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:43,531
Talking about a problem,

425
00:23:43,532 --> 00:23:46,531
ever since that day, there's a problem that's been on my mind.

426
00:23:46,532 --> 00:23:48,231
Hey, Conan!

427
00:23:48,232 --> 00:23:50,732
Let's at least wear it once and take a picture!

428
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:53,631
It's cute!

429
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,331
A junior in high school wearing stuffed animal pyjamas.

430
00:23:56,332 --> 00:23:57,432
What's more, it's a panda.

431
00:23:58,332 --> 00:24:02,931
"Next Episode"

432
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:05,931
I felt someone's eye on me.

433
00:24:05,932 --> 00:24:07,132
Maybe it's my imagination.

434
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:09,831
Grenier's skylight window.

435
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:11,631
Camera?

436
00:24:11,632 --> 00:24:13,831
Why? The Investigation Firm?

437
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:16,231
Are Pops being photographed?

438
00:24:16,232 --> 00:24:18,231
Could it be the Black Organization?

439
00:24:18,232 --> 00:24:19,532
Oh, no.

440
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:22,331
Oh, no! Oh, no!

441
00:24:22,332 --> 00:24:28,332
Next Conan, "The Grenier House on Beikacho".

442
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,131
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:24:46,132 --> 00:24:48,331
"Nameplate."

444
00:24:48,332 --> 00:24:49,931
In the next episode, those two who we haven't seen in a while...

445
00:24:49,932 --> 00:24:53,132
-Those two? -The surprise is for next week!
