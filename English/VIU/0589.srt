"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:05,897
By the way, Ran...

3
00:00:05,897 --> 00:00:06,997
Yeah?

4
00:00:06,997 --> 00:00:10,497
The long weekend is coming up, isn't it?

5
00:00:10,497 --> 00:00:11,597
Let's see.

6
00:00:11,597 --> 00:00:14,497
Monday the 11th is Health and Sports Day,

7
00:00:14,497 --> 00:00:16,397
so it's a three-day weekend.

8
00:00:16,397 --> 00:00:19,597
Why? Why? Are you taking us somewhere over the long weekend?

9
00:00:19,597 --> 00:00:22,397
Nope, I was just asking.

10
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,897
Is that so?

11
00:00:25,497 --> 00:00:29,297
Hey, if we don't hurry, we're going to miss the raffle.

12
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:30,797
You're right.

13
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:34,097
If you're going to the raffle, take my wallet.

14
00:00:34,097 --> 00:00:36,597
I've saved up quite a few raffle tickets.

15
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:37,997
Got it.

16
00:00:57,597 --> 00:00:59,397
Brooding over passing seasons

17
00:00:59,397 --> 00:01:01,297
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

18
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:02,897
The birthday of the lady that Kogoro is not good at handling.

19
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:04,997
Kogoro's great present strategy.

20
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:06,697
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:08,497
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

"The Worst Birthday (Part 1)"

24

It's true.

25
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:45,642
There are almost 20 raffle tickets in here.

26
00:02:45,642 --> 00:02:47,742
I wonder what he bought.

27
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:50,542
Maybe the receipts are in his wallet?

28
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,542
I do see some receipts,

29
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:55,442
but they're all for the snacks to go with his beer.

30
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,042
"Receipt" -Here it is.

31
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,442
50,000 yen!

32
00:02:59,742 --> 00:03:02,842
Beika Jewelry Shop... A necklace?

33
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:05,542
Don't tell me that dad

34
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:08,742
is going around supporting some bar waitress?

35
00:03:08,742 --> 00:03:11,642
Maybe it's a birthday present for someone.

36
00:03:11,642 --> 00:03:15,642
Birthday? Mine's still way off.

37
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:19,242
If it's not for you, then it must be for...

38
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:23,842
That's it! October 10th is mom's birthday!

39
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:25,342
That must be it!

40
00:03:25,342 --> 00:03:27,842
He was checking the date a while ago.

41
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:32,342
I bet dad must've remembered mom's birthday.

42
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:33,942
So do I.

43
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:37,342
Because you'd always mention it at school sports day as a child.

44
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,742
October 10th is my mom's birthday.

45
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:44,442
I'll win the first place and give her the red ribbon as present!

46
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:45,642
As you'd say.

47
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:51,442
So, did he give us his wallet and let us find the receipt

48
00:03:51,442 --> 00:03:53,542
because he wants us to arrange a situation

49
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:55,942
that would make it easier for him to give mom the present?

50
00:03:55,942 --> 00:03:59,342
Pretty smooth, Pops.

51
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:02,242
But, what should I do to ensure they meet each other?

52
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,142
As usual, you can invite them to have a meal together.

53
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:08,042
The usual way won't do. It has got to be special.

54
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:10,142
Then, how about something like that?

55
00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:12,942
"1st Prize: Shizuoka Seaside Hotel Stay For Two"

56
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:15,342
A hotel stay for two.

57
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,042
All right! Leave it to me.

58
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,042
What?

59
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:23,842
You won tickets for a free hotel stay?

60
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:26,842
Even better, it comes with an exquisite dinner!

61
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:30,042
What tremendous luck she has.

62
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:33,542
It seems all right to bring Conan along so long as I ask.

63
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:36,742
So the three of us will go this weekend, all right?

64
00:04:36,742 --> 00:04:38,942
-Yeah. -Of course.

65
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:43,442
Be sure to bring everything you need.

66
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:45,242
All right.

67
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:49,142
"Law Eri Kisaki" -A hotel stay in Shizuoka next weekend?

68
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:53,042
Is this another scheme to pair me up with that mustached old man?

69
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:56,142
Bingo, exactly!

70
00:04:56,142 --> 00:05:01,842
Sorry, but I have an appointment with someone for work next Monday.

71
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:04,342
Why do you think dad was able to get so many tickets

72
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:07,142
to win the hotel stay?

73
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:10,342
It's because he spent 50,000 yen to buy a necklace.

74
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:13,942
I bet it's a birthday present for someone.

75
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:15,842
But I guess it's too bad.

76
00:05:15,842 --> 00:05:18,342
It can't be helped if you already have an appointment.

77
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:20,342
Wait... Wait a second!

78
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:22,542
If it's Shizuoka we're talking about, it'll be perfect.

79
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:25,142
The person I'm meeting on Monday is from Shizuoka

80
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:28,642
and I was actually supposed to meet her there.

81
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:32,942
Then, we'll meet you next Sunday at Shizuoka Seaside Hotel.

82
00:05:36,642 --> 00:05:41,342
Attorney, you're supposed to meet your client here, right?

83
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,642
Isn't it fine?

84
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:46,242
Since I'm taking the trouble to go and meet her personally.

85

"10th October"

86
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:51,942
Well? I'm here at the hotel.

87
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:54,142
What should I do now?

88
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:58,042
Just relax for a bit before dinner time.

89
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:03,442
I think dad will give you the present before or right after the meal.

90
00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:06,642
After that, maybe you two can spend the night together in his room.

91
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:10,442
The two of us? What will you be doing, then?

92
00:06:10,442 --> 00:06:13,842
Conan and I will spend the night in your room.

93
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:15,542
Right, Conan?

94
00:06:18,842 --> 00:06:21,542
Looks like someone's here. I have to go.

95
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:23,542
Mom.

96
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:25,242
Happy birthday.

97
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:28,242
Thank you.

98
00:06:30,142 --> 00:06:32,942
Oh, Mrs. Kokubu.

99
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:35,542
Our meeting was scheduled for tomorrow.

100
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:39,142
My husband came with me and we ended up having a fight.

101
00:06:39,142 --> 00:06:41,342
"Akiho Kokubu (28), Client" -I'm sorry...

102
00:06:41,342 --> 00:06:45,042
but do you mind if I stay here tonight?

103
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:49,042
I don't mind sleeping on the sofa.

104
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:52,542
But, prior to tomorrow's settlement negotiations,

105
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:55,842
wouldn't it be best if you discuss everything with your husband?

106
00:06:55,842 --> 00:06:57,342
I already told you.

107
00:06:57,342 --> 00:07:00,542
I don't want to stay near that dork.

108
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:05,242
But you're the one dealing with the stalker problem.

109
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:06,942
We need to talk over the amount of consolation money

110
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:10,042
as well as the terms for the out-of-court settlement.

111
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:18,542
Hello, this is Kisaki, the attorney speaking.

112
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:21,442
Is this Mrs. Akiho Kokubu's room?

113
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:24,642
Yes. This is Akiho's husband, Takehiko speaking.

114
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:27,842
A moment ago, your wife came to my room, Number 306,

115
00:07:27,842 --> 00:07:30,742
and she has fallen asleep.

116
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,842
I'll be going out and won't return until 11.00 pm.

117
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:38,942
Would you mind coming by to get her at some point?

118
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,742
"Takehiko Kokubu (30)" -I think she'll cool off...

119
00:07:40,742 --> 00:07:43,342
"Akiho's Husband" -after she's slept off her drunkenness.

120
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:45,142
Yes, I understand.

121
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,642
Oh, my. Attorney.

122
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:56,042
I'm counting on you during tomorrow's negotiations.

123
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,042
"Midori Hino (51)" -Since it seems to be true that my son

124
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:00,142
"Opposing Party In The Negotiation" -has been following the woman,

125
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:03,442
we'll pay the extent of the settlement fee.

126
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,342
But this all started because that former race queen tricked

127
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:09,442
and toyed with my son's feelings.

128
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:12,542
I intend to give her a piece of my mind about it.

129
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:16,042
Well, let's talk about it tomorrow.

130
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:20,042
I take it that your son's not here with you, correct?

131
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:24,242
That's a requirement for our negotiation.

132
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:27,442
No, I didn't bring him.

133
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:31,742
But who knows whether he'd followed me here...

134
00:08:31,742 --> 00:08:34,042
"Seiji Hino (26), Midori's Son" -on his own or not.

135
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:39,642
Geez! We haven't seen each other for so long.

136
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:42,842
Couldn't you wear something sexier than this?

137
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:46,542
Well, it seems you aren't surprised that I showed up here.

138
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:48,842
Yeah. Judging from the way Ran was talking,

139
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:52,742
I expected a certain old lady would be coming along.

140
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:56,942
Ran, apologies, but will it be all right if I leave now?

141
00:08:56,942 --> 00:08:59,542
Now, now! Since all of us are already here,

142
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:02,842
let's just enjoy this exquisite dinner.

143
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,342
This old guy. Is he even planning to give her a present?

144
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,842
The food is really delicious, isn't it?

145
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:15,942
Yes, it really is.

146
00:09:15,942 --> 00:09:18,542
It's totally different from someone's cooking.

147
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:24,742
That reminds me of the last time the three of us had a meal together.

148
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:26,842
It was my birthday, wasn't it?

149
00:09:26,842 --> 00:09:28,442
Right?

150
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,642
Yeah.

151
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:32,942
Was it?

152
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:41,742
Anyway, isn't this restaurant a little warm?

153
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:42,842
What's this?

154
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:46,142
Mom, you aren't wearing anything around your neck.

155
00:09:47,142 --> 00:09:50,842
Yeah, I haven't found an accessory I like.

156
00:09:50,842 --> 00:09:53,442
Why don't you try wearing a collar, then?

157
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,842
Just like the one your cat's wearing.

158
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:03,442
Bear with it. He says things like that, but I bet he's just teasing you

159
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:06,642
and waiting for the final moment of your birthday to give it to you.

160
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:13,942
Hey, dad.

161
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:17,642
He's passed out.

162
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:21,742
There's only an hour left of my birthday.

163
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:26,642
Sorry, but I'll head back to the room now.

164
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:31,242
Of course, I do mean my own room.

165
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:35,742
Gosh.

166
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:47,942
Looks like Mrs. Kokubu has left.

167
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:49,742
But what was all that about?

168
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:52,342
The necklace that man bought.

169
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:57,642
Could it be that he's being duped by some woman?

170
00:10:57,642 --> 00:10:59,442
Oh, goodness.

171
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:01,142
Looks like I don't have a choice.

172
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:12,742
Seriously, what a terrible birthday.

173
00:11:14,242 --> 00:11:18,142
I'll ask again. Why should I apologize to her?

174
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:20,942
Because there's something you haven't given her.

175
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:25,142
It's all right. There are still three minutes left.

176
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:29,442
Huh? Is mom asleep?

177
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:31,842
Yes, who's there?

178
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:34,842
It's me. I've got something to tell you.

179
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:36,142
Can't it wait until tomorrow?

180
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:39,742
It has to be done today. Please let me in.

181
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:44,042
Gosh. What is it?

182
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,742
Why are you dressed like that, idiot?

183
00:11:47,742 --> 00:11:50,942
I was taking a shower. Does that bug you?

184
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:53,942
Well? What do you want to talk about?

185
00:11:53,942 --> 00:11:55,842
If it's about that mustached old man,

186
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:58,342
I have nothing to say.

187
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:06,242
Mrs. Kokubu? Hang in there!

188
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:12,242
Mrs. Kokubu? Mrs. Kokubu!

189
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,889
The estimated time of death is between 10.00 pm and 11.00 pm.

190
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:20,389
Her death was caused by blunt force.

191
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:24,189
She was struck on the back of the head with a blunt object.

192
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:27,289
However, we have yet to locate the murder weapon.

193
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:31,489
So, are you and the victim acquainted?

194
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,789
Well, Attorney...

195
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:36,189
I'm Eri Kisaki.

196
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:39,189
She was a client of mine.

197
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:41,589
Her name is Akiho Kokubu.

198
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:43,789
She was dealing with a stalker problem.

199
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:44,989
We had planned to conduct

200
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:47,089
a settlement negotiation in this room tomorrow.

201
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:49,689
Why was she in your room?

202
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:52,889
She was staying in this hotel with her husband,

203
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:55,989
and the two had a dispute around sundown.

204
00:12:55,989 --> 00:12:59,689
That's when she said she wanted to stay in my room,

205
00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:02,289
and she fell asleep here.

206
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:06,089
Of course, I made a call to her husband who was in his room.

207
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:08,489
I told him I'd be out of the room until 11.00 pm

208
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:11,689
and asked him to pick her up when it was convenient for him.

209
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:15,189
And judging by the fact that she wasn't here

210
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:16,889
when I returned shortly after 11.00 pm,

211
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:20,389
I was fairly sure that her husband had come to get her.

212
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:22,689
Hold on a second, please!

213
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:24,989
Are you absolutely certain that there was nobody here

214
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:28,389
when you returned to this room?

215
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:30,189
Yes.

216
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:32,489
The door to this room is auto-locked.

217
00:13:32,489 --> 00:13:35,689
Without the keycard, no one could've come in from outside!

218
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:40,189
Also, the window is designed so that no one can go through it.

219
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:43,389
There wasn't a body here when you came back to the room.

220
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,889
And yet, you claim that

221
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:47,889
a body suddenly appeared after you took a shower.

222
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:49,889
That makes this a locked room murder!

223
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:53,389
It's an impossible crime!

224
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:55,689
Or perhaps the truth is that you returned to the room

225
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:57,689
and had an argument with the victim.

226
00:13:57,689 --> 00:14:01,689
Therefore, you killed her in a fit of anger.

227
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:02,789
What?

228
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:06,589
Then, while you were taking a shower to clean the blood on you,

229
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:09,489
Mr. Mouri arrived.

230
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:12,789
If that was the case, wouldn't I have refused to let him in?

231
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:15,689
Precisely. Utilizing reverse psychology,

232
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:20,089
you invited the great Detective Mouri inside.

233
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:23,989
It's all to make a simple crime appear impossible.

234
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,289
Listen...

235
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:30,689
Regardless, it's possible that you still have a weapon on you.

236
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:32,689
I'll call a female officer to conduct a full body search.

237
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:35,589
That won't be necessary.

238
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:39,389
I already stripped her completely in the bathroom

239
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:41,489
and checked her thoroughly.

240
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:44,389
Strip... Stripped her completely?

241
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:45,789
Yeah.

242
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:47,789
She was only wearing a bath towel,

243
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:50,289
so that's all I had to remove.

244
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,889
No... What I'm saying is...

245
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:55,189
That's sexual harassment!

246
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:56,889
-It's fine. -What?

247
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:58,789
We're a married couple.

248
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:00,689
But we're living separately.

249
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:03,789
Married... A married couple?

250
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:05,989
But your name...

251
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:09,189
Kisaki is my mom's maiden name.

252
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:12,589
She only uses it for professional purposes.

253
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:15,189
Oh, my. So you're his wife.

254
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:17,189
We finally got to meet each other.

255
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:18,489
Finally?

256
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:22,689
You see, every time Mr. Mouri is with a beautiful woman,

257
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:26,389
I mistake the woman for his wife.

258
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:29,389
Idiot! You talk too much!

259
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:33,389
But in any case, your statement will be considered a family testimony

260
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:36,189
and can't be admitted into the investigation.

261
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:39,189
On the other hand, we'll have to consider the possibility

262
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:42,289
that you two conspired together to destroy any evidence.

263
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:44,289
Hey, hey, Yokomizo.

264
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:46,489
Because if that isn't the case,

265
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:50,289
we can't really explain this locked room mystery.

266
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:54,289
There's even a blood stain over there.

267
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:57,889
Take a look at the bottom of the bed sheet.

268
00:15:57,889 --> 00:15:59,989
Blood?

269
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:04,289
But why isn't there any blood on the carpet below?

270
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:06,589
Could it be that the bed was moved,

271
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:08,289
and that's why the blood stain is there?

272
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:10,589
It was done to hide the body.

273
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:11,789
That's possible.

274
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:14,489
The culprit concealed the body by moving the bed

275
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:17,789
and hid right beside the body.

276
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:19,989
And while I was taking a shower,

277
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:23,189
he moved the bed back into position to reveal the body,

278
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:26,389
and he escaped from this room unnoticed.

279
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:29,889
But if you hadn't taken a shower,

280
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,089
the culprit wouldn't have been able to use that trick.

281
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:37,289
Yeah, if you had gone to bed in a drooling mess as usual,

282
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:39,089
the culprit would have been all out of luck.

283
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:43,389
Drooling? Aren't you talking about yourself?

284
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:45,989
That mess wasn't from drooling.

285
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:48,289
It was from coke, right?

286
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:50,589
See, there are spots on the carpet in front of the fridge

287
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:52,989
that seem to be coke stains.

288
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:56,289
And I can still see a pool of coke

289
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:59,189
on the lid of the can sitting on top of the fridge.

290
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:01,289
-Is that true? -Yes.

291
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:03,489
I decided to drink it after I came back,

292
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,489
but it sprayed all over me.

293
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:09,989
And I forgot I had put it on the refrigerator.

294
00:17:09,989 --> 00:17:14,889
But don't you usually only drink water, tea or coffee?

295
00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:18,989
The only drink available inside was carbonated drink.

296
00:17:18,989 --> 00:17:23,289
Anyway, if the body was hidden under the bed,

297
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:27,789
there must have been at least two culprits.

298
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,989
Why is that so?

299
00:17:29,989 --> 00:17:32,589
It would be quite difficult for one person to lift

300
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:35,289
and move something this heavy.

301
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:38,489
There aren't any skid marks on the carpet either.

302
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:42,689
There are blood stains by the foot of the bed.

303
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:44,289
The large ones are most likely from the blood splattered

304
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:45,989
when the victim was struck.

305
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:47,889
But what's with these small ones in the foreground

306
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:52,089
that are equally spaced and gradually fade?

307
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:54,389
Inspector Yokomizo!

308
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:57,289
We discovered that shortly before the time of the crime around 9:30 pm,

309
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:01,589
several calls were made to this room.

310
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:04,589
-Is that so? -Wasn't it the victim's husband...

311
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,989
who was asked to come pick her up?

312
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:10,189
One of the calls was from the victim's Room 309,

313
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,189
so that must be true.

314
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:14,889
However, another call was made from Room 302.

315
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:16,589
Room 302?

316
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:18,489
It's Mrs. Hino's room.

317
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:19,989
You know that?

318
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:21,589
Yeah.

319
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:25,589
She's the mother of the stalker I told you earlier.

320
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:29,289
But why would she call this room?

321
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:32,189
My wife was murdered?

322
00:18:32,189 --> 00:18:34,789
Who... Who did it? And why?

323
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:37,589
We're currently investigating that.

324
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:42,189
But why didn't you pick your wife up?

325
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:45,789
I did call and say I'd pick her up,

326
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:49,389
but she bellowed that she wouldn't let me in even if I came over.

327
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:52,889
That why despite feeling sorry to the attorney, I thought it'd be best

328
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:54,989
for her to keep my wife in her room for the night

329
00:18:54,989 --> 00:18:58,989
so I could come by in the morning after she cooled down.

330
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:01,289
What was the cause of your argument?

331
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:03,089
Well, it was...

332
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:04,889
Was it about this?

333
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:07,589
Conan.

334
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:12,989
It's a bunch of mini cars.

335
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:15,289
I've loved cars since I was a kid,

336
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:17,489
and lining them up helps me feel calm.

337
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,089
But how could this have caused the fight?

338
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:22,689
See.

339
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:25,789
The side mirror was tossed onto the floor.

340
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,789
A man who loves cars wouldn't do something this violent, right?

341
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:31,589
So your wife did this?

342
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:34,889
Yeah. She told me to quit this childish and disgusting hobby

343
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:36,389
and threw it.

344
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:40,589
Sir, which one of these cars is your favorite?

345
00:19:41,989 --> 00:19:46,789
It's the beloved car of the legendary actor, James Dean.

346
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:48,389
This Porsche.

347
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,389
By the way, was it only you and your wife in this room?

348
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:58,889
Yeah. I'd only let show this kind of hobby to my wife.

349
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:02,489
That woman was murdered?

350
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:06,989
Well, I've always figured one of the foolish men she deceived

351
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:10,689
would eventually kill her.

352
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:14,589
On that note, it's my understanding that you called the victim.

353
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:18,689
Yeah, I called the attorney to see

354
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:21,789
if we could slightly change the time of our negotiation tomorrow.

355
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:24,989
But I was shocked when that woman picked up the phone.

356
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:28,489
Why did you wish to change the time?

357
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:32,989
The golf appointment I had with a friend got moved up.

358
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:35,789
So you plan to play golf soon after

359
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:37,389
your stalker son's settlement negotiations.

360
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:38,689
Why not?

361
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:42,089
After all, there's a good golf course nearby.

362
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:45,589
By the way, are you staying in this room by yourself?

363
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:46,789
Yes, that right.

364
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:49,189
Can't you tell this is a single room?

365
00:20:50,689 --> 00:20:53,289
There's another occupant in this room.

366
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:54,589
What?

367
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:58,589
There aren't lipstick marks on these cigarette butts.

368
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:03,389
And the filter is still damp.

369
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:05,189
It really is.

370
00:21:05,189 --> 00:21:06,789
Is that right?

371
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:11,189
That's enough, Seiji!

372
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:12,889
Get out here!

373
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:17,989
So that's your stalker son?

374
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:20,689
I told you that my son was only deceived.

375
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:25,389
But you were instructed not to bring your son here, were you not?

376
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:29,189
Well, he happened to be here

377
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:31,889
because he'll be touring with his friends

378
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:32,989
on their bikes tomorrow morning.

379
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:35,689
Then show us that bike.

380
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:37,989
Right here.

381
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:42,389
Look.

382
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:46,589
A road bike?

383
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:50,689
But, why did you hide your son?

384
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:55,289
I thought that woman called the police to arrest my son, so...

385
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:59,089
Incidentally, please tell us your whereabouts and what you did

386
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:01,689
between 10.00 pm and 11.00 pm.

387
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:03,689
I was drinking with my mom.

388
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,289
If you think we're lying, verify it yourself.

389
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:09,089
We were at the hotel lounge on the top floor.

390
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:15,889
Attorney Kisaki's client, Akiho Kokubu was murdered in her room.

391
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:17,789
There are three suspects.

392
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:21,289
Akiho's husband, Takehiko Kokubu.

393
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:24,789
The man who stalked Akiho, Seiji Hino.

394
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:27,689
And his mother, Midori Hino.

395
00:22:28,689 --> 00:22:31,889
The person who murdered Akiho Kokubu

396
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:34,789
should be among these three people.

397
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:00,389
There's something under the pillow.

398
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:02,389
A present?

399
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:06,089
You have to lower the expectation, then raise it for a surprise.

400
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:10,489
Why can't I find the key to solving this case

401
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:12,489
at such a critical moment?

402
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:14,289
Darn it.

403
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:17,289
Well, since this special day only comes once a year,

404
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,989
I'll let Pops show off this time.

405
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:24,589
Next Conan, "The Worst Birthday (Part 2)"
