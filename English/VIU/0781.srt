1
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:04,607
Natsuko Shibuya, agent Jodie's friend is attacked by someone,

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:08,308
rendered unconscious and is in critical condition.

3
00:00:09,508 --> 00:00:11,507
Therefore, we rush over to see her.

4
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:14,107
Three suspects are summoned.

5
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:16,207
Furthermore...

6
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:17,908
It couldn't be helped.

7
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:23,507
She asked me to solve a stalker problem for her you see.

8
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:26,207
Bourbon?

9
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:29,107
After that, Bourbon and I through our deductions succeeded

10
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:32,507
in specifying the perpetrator. However...

11
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:34,507
Excuse me!

12
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:36,507
The hospital just called.

13
00:00:36,508 --> 00:00:38,607
Ms. Shibuya took a turn for the worse

14
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:41,607
and she's in critical condition.

15
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,608
Natsuko?

16
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:50,508
Natsuko!

17
00:00:52,408 --> 00:00:55,407
Oh, Jodie. You came all the way out here to see me.

18
00:00:55,408 --> 00:00:56,607
Yes...

19
00:00:56,608 --> 00:01:00,107
But, it's amazing you knew that I regained consciousness.

20
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:01,207
Huh?

21
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,007
As to what happened this time, I'm to blame too,

22
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:05,707
so I feel quite uncomfortable.

23
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:09,007
I told them not to let the school know about it yet.

24
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:10,507
This is bad.

25
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:11,907
Ms. Jodie!

26
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:13,407
Where's Agent Camel now?

27
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:15,908
I think he's by the car?

28
00:01:17,308 --> 00:01:18,308
"Haido Central Hospital"

29
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:20,407
Rikumichi Kusuda?

30
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:22,707
I don't know a guy like that.

31
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,007
He's a guy who used to be hospitalized here,

32
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:29,507
stopped his car nearby and went missing.

33
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:32,207
I hear that there was a gun involved or something.

34
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,707
Haven't you heard anything about it from your buddies?

35
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:35,907
Nope.

36
00:01:35,908 --> 00:01:37,607
Oh, I see!

37
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:39,907
I guess it's information that's not passed down

38
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:43,007
to a low-ranking agent like you.

39
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:44,607
Just what are you talking about?

40
00:01:44,608 --> 00:01:47,007
We always share common information...

41
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,307
Camel!

42
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,107
Just what're you doing?

43
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:52,308
Stay with me, will you?

44
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:01,007
I hope you didn't tell him about Kusuda?

45
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:02,707
Of course not.

46
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:06,207
I wouldn't dare say that the guy shot himself to death in the car.

47
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,807
My lips are sealed.

48
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:12,407
I see. Thank you.

49
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:16,307
Well, it's an incident that occurred before I was dispatched to Japan,

50
00:02:16,308 --> 00:02:20,507
so I just heard about it from Mr. Akai.

51
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:21,708
Jodie?

52
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:24,108
Where are you?

53
00:02:25,308 --> 00:02:26,508
Jodie?

54
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:33,107
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

55
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:35,207
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

56
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,707
What happened then?

57
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,707
The dangerous conversation between two mysterious people.

58
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,307
He sees through the one and only truth.

59
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:42,207
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

60
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,508
His name is Detective Conan!

61
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:04,485
"The Scarlet Interplay"

62
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:06,986
"Haido Central Hospital" "The Day Before"

63
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:09,886
What?

64
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:14,386
Jodie?

65
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:24,185
Camel!

66
00:05:24,186 --> 00:05:26,485
Jodie!

67
00:05:26,486 --> 00:05:28,185
Is everything okay?

68
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:31,085
What do you mean?

69
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:33,785
That guy who is a member of the Organization, Amuro.

70
00:05:33,786 --> 00:05:37,585
I saw his car drive out of this hospital.

71
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:41,985
I hope you didn't leak any information out taken in by his glib talk?

72
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:43,885
No.

73
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:47,085
Rather, you said the same thing just a while ago too, didn't you?

74
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:49,485
What? A while ago?

75
00:05:49,486 --> 00:05:52,585
Well, just a while ago, the exact same thing.

76
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,285
What're you talking about?

77
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:58,785
I just got back here from Natsuko's room just now.

78
00:05:58,786 --> 00:06:00,085
What?

79
00:06:00,086 --> 00:06:03,786
Then what about the Jodie I saw a while ago?

80
00:06:04,986 --> 00:06:08,686
The skill to change the tone of voice and amazing disguising technique.

81
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:12,986
A woman posses a combination of both.

82
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:17,986
There's just one person.

83
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:33,485
It took you longer than I expected.

84
00:06:33,486 --> 00:06:36,286
I was worried that you wouldn't show up.

85
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:43,285
I couldn't find a scarf that was similar to the kind she was wearing.

86
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:44,686
I see.

87
00:06:51,186 --> 00:06:53,186
And how did it go?

88
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:56,285
That guy called Kusuda.

89
00:06:56,286 --> 00:06:58,686
Just as you assumed...

90
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:08,286
He seems to have shot himself to death.

91
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:13,886
In his own car.

92
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:19,685
So, it was just as I thought.

93
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:22,686
What? Vermouth did?

94
00:07:27,586 --> 00:07:29,985
Are you saying that the Jodie I saw a while ago

95
00:07:29,986 --> 00:07:33,185
was Vermouth in disguise?

96
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,785
Yes.

97
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:37,085
Bourbon asked you something, didn't he?

98
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:41,285
Yeah, but I didn't answer him at all.

99
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:43,785
He tried to provoke me by saying that

100
00:07:43,786 --> 00:07:47,985
information isn't handed down to a low-ranking agent like me though.

101
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:51,185
He tries to provoke you mentally that way and pressure you.

102
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:53,485
Then, when your comrade, Jodie, comes around,

103
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:56,285
you feel comfortable and your tongue slips.

104
00:07:56,286 --> 00:07:59,685
He uses that kind of psychology!

105
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:01,585
Wait up!

106
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:04,785
You mean that Vermouth knew I was coming to this hospital

107
00:08:04,786 --> 00:08:06,985
and waiting for us here?

108
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,285
Yeah.

109
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:13,985
We're just moving in accordance to how Bourbon and Vermouth want us to.

110
00:08:13,986 --> 00:08:15,485
Just what do you mean?

111
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:21,185
It all started when you received the text mail from Ms. Shibuya, right?

112
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:25,785
That's when Bourbon and Vermouth's strategy began!

113
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:29,685
You mean that text mail she sent asking me to go drinking with her?

114
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:31,085
Yes.

115
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:35,185
Ms. Shibuya said that she didn't remember sending out such a mail, right?

116
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:37,285
Right.

117
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:39,685
That is why I think that is the mail

118
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:44,085
that Bourbon had texted out from Ms. Shibuya's cell phone!

119
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:45,086
What?

120
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:46,585
I think it's pretty difficult

121
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:50,685
to steal the cell phone of an FBI like you.

122
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:56,585
But to secretly steal one of an ordinary elementary school teacher is easy.

123
00:08:56,586 --> 00:09:00,885
If Bourbon met Ms. Shibuya many times as a detective,

124
00:09:00,886 --> 00:09:03,485
he would've had more than enough chances to do so.

125
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:06,785
But, why would he go that far to text out a mail like that?

126
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:12,885
That's to make you call Ms. Shibuya

127
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,785
using agent Camel's cell phone!

128
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:17,885
What?

129
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:20,985
If it's to go drinking, the time would be night.

130
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:22,485
He knew that at around that time

131
00:09:22,486 --> 00:09:26,685
your cell phone would be out of battery.

132
00:09:26,686 --> 00:09:28,385
He was watching us.

133
00:09:28,386 --> 00:09:31,385
But why my cell phone?

134
00:09:31,386 --> 00:09:34,885
Any FBI agent would've been fine.

135
00:09:34,886 --> 00:09:38,485
So long as some sort of accident happened to Ms. Shibuya that night,

136
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:42,185
the agent whose call history was left on her cell phone,

137
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:46,885
would be called to come along with you.

138
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,385
I see.

139
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:50,685
So in other words

140
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:55,685
his target was the FBI agent that came along with me to begin with.

141
00:09:55,686 --> 00:10:00,785
But Natsuko was pushed off the stairs of the park by Mr. Kandachi

142
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:02,285
and seriously injured,

143
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:04,985
what if that never occurred?

144
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:08,685
Maybe he was planning to run her over and seriously injure her.

145
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:12,285
After all, Bourbon said he was riding a car.

146
00:10:12,286 --> 00:10:14,485
No matter what method he used,

147
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:17,785
I think he was planning to get her into an accident outside.

148
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:19,185
Outside?

149
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,385
Right.

150
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,585
In order to confirm the clothes that you were wearing, Jodie.

151
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:25,085
My clothes?

152
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:29,485
Your face can be disguised with the pictures of you that had been taken

153
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:32,186
but it doesn't work out with the clothes that you're wearing today.

154
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:36,585
Rather than have you stay in the car or inside a room,

155
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:38,385
it would be easier to get a full view of you

156
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:41,885
or take sneak photos of you outside.

157
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:44,985
And once the disguise is ready,

158
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:49,485
he lures you, Jodie, over to the hospital by saying that

159
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:51,385
Ms. Shibuya's condition had worsened or something.

160
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:57,285
He distracted agent Camel to get you away from him.

161
00:10:57,286 --> 00:10:59,885
Which means that Vermouth, who disguised herself as me,

162
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:03,785
successfully got you to give out information?

163
00:11:03,786 --> 00:11:05,585
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:09,485
But Conan, from about when did you realize all this?

165
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:12,185
When we got the call from the hospital.

166
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:14,185
Because if it's about the patient, who's involved in a case,

167
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:16,485
the police would be contacted,

168
00:11:16,486 --> 00:11:20,585
but as to anything other than that, only the family is contacted.

169
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:23,685
Conan, then why didn't you tell me about it?

170
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:26,085
I wasn't sure yet.

171
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:29,785
There's a possibility that she could've been disguised as Ms. Shibuya too.

172
00:11:29,786 --> 00:11:31,385
Really?

173
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:36,286
But what on earth was Bourbon after?

174
00:11:37,386 --> 00:11:41,085
And? What information did you leak?

175
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:42,385
Oh, yes.

176
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:49,585
About their spy who was hospitalized at this hospital, Rikumichi Kusuda.

177
00:11:49,586 --> 00:11:53,586
The one who shot himself in his own car!

178
00:11:57,186 --> 00:11:58,585
Is that all?

179
00:11:58,586 --> 00:11:59,985
Yes.

180
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:04,285
Since Conan had warned me about it in the car on our way here,

181
00:12:04,286 --> 00:12:05,785
my tongue slipped.

182
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:10,585
But what kind of merit is it them getting such information out of you?

183
00:12:10,586 --> 00:12:11,586
Well...

184
00:12:11,587 --> 00:12:15,985
If Kusuda, who they thought was nabbed by the FBI, is dead,

185
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:19,985
there's no worry of him leaking anything out, I guess?

186
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:23,485
I wonder if there's some other meaning to this?

187
00:12:23,486 --> 00:12:25,086
How about it, Conan?

188
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:28,586
Conan?

189
00:12:35,677 --> 00:12:37,176
Conan?

190
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:39,476
Hey, Conan.

191
00:12:39,477 --> 00:12:41,076
What's the matter?

192
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:42,277
Conan?

193
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:53,476
What's this Rikumichi Kusuda about?

194
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:56,976
I hear he was a member of the Organization.

195
00:12:56,977 --> 00:13:01,876
What's the big deal about a man, who wasn't even given a code name,

196
00:13:01,877 --> 00:13:03,277
shooting himself to death?

197
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:11,076
If you were to commit suicide using a gun,

198
00:13:11,077 --> 00:13:13,077
what would you do?

199
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:15,976
Well...

200
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:20,776
I would point the muzzle of the gun to the temple.

201
00:13:20,777 --> 00:13:22,176
That's right.

202
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:26,076
And the mark of the bullet would clearly remain in the skull

203
00:13:26,077 --> 00:13:28,976
even if the corpse were to be burned.

204
00:13:28,977 --> 00:13:30,077
What?

205
00:13:34,877 --> 00:13:36,777
There was such an incident.

206
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:41,877
About the time the whereabouts of Kusuda became unknown.

207
00:13:46,677 --> 00:13:48,976
Just about the same time,

208
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:52,977
there was a man who was shot in the head and burned.

209
00:13:55,277 --> 00:13:57,777
That's...

210
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:02,776
Right.

211
00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:04,877
FBI agent,

212
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:11,077
Shuichi Akai.

213
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:18,376
Don't tell me...

214
00:14:18,377 --> 00:14:20,976
That he's alive?

215
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:24,677
Yes. If my deduction is correct.

216
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:35,476
Too bad, but your deduction's way off.

217
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:39,976
Because his death was confirmed.

218
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:43,676
Furthermore, the people who confirmed it are the Japanese police

219
00:14:43,677 --> 00:14:47,976
and the people who made them confirm that was the FBI.

220
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:49,976
I mentioned before, didn't I?

221
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:53,176
That the fingerprints of Akai's corpse that Kir shot the head of

222
00:14:53,177 --> 00:14:57,076
at Raiha Pass and burned together with his car,

223
00:14:57,077 --> 00:14:59,576
and the fingerprints of Akai

224
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:03,076
found on that detective boy's cell phone matched.

225
00:15:03,077 --> 00:15:04,476
I see.

226
00:15:04,477 --> 00:15:07,976
But, how were you able to get the fingerprints from a corpse?

227
00:15:07,977 --> 00:15:12,076
That's because he was burned with one hand inside the pocket

228
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,676
of his fireproof slacks.

229
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:16,976
That's the kind of guy he is...

230
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:19,376
Even back when he shot me with his shotgun,

231
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,977
he had one hand in his pocket too.

232
00:15:25,677 --> 00:15:27,776
Using a shotgun with one hand?

233
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:29,576
Just like him to do so.

234
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:33,076
But it's also thinkable that one hand was put in the pocket

235
00:15:33,077 --> 00:15:37,476
so that fingerprints could be taken later.

236
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:39,576
If you're that suspicious,

237
00:15:39,577 --> 00:15:42,976
would you like to see the image of when Akai was shot?

238
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:47,776
You mean the video that Kir took with the hidden camera

239
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:49,676
he was wearing around his neck back then.

240
00:15:49,677 --> 00:15:50,876
Right.

241
00:15:50,877 --> 00:15:54,376
The video in which that guy was definitely killed

242
00:15:54,377 --> 00:15:56,177
was clearly taken on that camera.

243
00:16:03,777 --> 00:16:05,376
What's the matter, Kir?

244
00:16:05,377 --> 00:16:07,176
Hurry and finish him off.

245
00:16:07,177 --> 00:16:10,476
But since I already shot through his lung,

246
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:13,277
he'll be dead in about 30 minutes even if I leave him as is.

247
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:16,176
His head.

248
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:19,276
Blast a bullet into his head

249
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:22,976
That'll kill him off for sure.

250
00:16:22,977 --> 00:16:24,277
Roger.

251
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:45,477
And before he was shot in the head, he mumbled...

252
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:51,376
I didn't think you'd go this far.

253
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,677
I'm surprised too.

254
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:06,876
I'd like to comment from the standpoint of an actress,

255
00:17:06,877 --> 00:17:09,176
it was no preset dialogue.

256
00:17:09,177 --> 00:17:11,876
Those were words that came from the bottom of the heart.

257
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:14,076
It was no act.

258
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:16,176
I'm disappointed though,

259
00:17:16,177 --> 00:17:19,777
that I had to play along with such a farce.

260
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:29,077
"I didn't think you'd go this far..."

261
00:17:30,277 --> 00:17:32,977
"I didn't think you'd go this far."

262
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:37,077
I didn't think you'd go this far.

263
00:17:43,877 --> 00:17:46,477
I see, that's the story.

264
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:54,576
Well, I'll prove whether my deduction is correct or not.

265
00:17:54,577 --> 00:17:55,577
After cornering him into a circumstance

266
00:17:55,578 --> 00:17:57,876
where he can't say a word or find his way out of.

267
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:03,676
So I guess you know the whereabouts of that ghost, then.

268
00:18:03,677 --> 00:18:06,277
No, not yet.

269
00:18:10,277 --> 00:18:11,676
As long as I know the trick,

270
00:18:11,677 --> 00:18:13,476
for me to check up on it is more than easy.

271
00:18:13,477 --> 00:18:18,677
I can do it in less than a day.

272
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:47,076
Is Conan going to be absent today?

273
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:50,276
Yes, it seems he caught a cold and is in bed.

274
00:18:50,277 --> 00:18:54,176
What? And today's school lunch is curry rice!

275
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:55,776
Is that what you're worried about?

276
00:18:55,777 --> 00:18:57,576
Well, it's curry, you know, curry!

277
00:18:57,577 --> 00:19:00,376
It even comes with pudding!

278
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:03,276
Well, since he was secretly doing things with Dr. Agasa yesterday,

279
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:06,377
I'm not sure if he really has a cold or not.

280
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:23,376
"Mouri Detective Agency"

281
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:26,176
Conan!

282
00:19:26,177 --> 00:19:28,776
What time was the Macademy Awards?

283
00:19:28,777 --> 00:19:30,576
What?

284
00:19:30,577 --> 00:19:34,577
Dad, isn't Conan back from school yet?

285
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:38,676
That brat called to say that he's staying over at Dr. Agasa's place

286
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,076
so he wouldn't be eating dinner here.

287
00:19:41,077 --> 00:19:42,176
No!

288
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:46,276
I was looking forward to watching the Macademy Awards with him.

289
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:51,576
What's so good about a foreign movie award program?

290
00:19:51,577 --> 00:19:57,876
Well, Shinichi's father has been nominated for the best script award.

291
00:19:57,877 --> 00:19:59,576
That's something to look forward to, isn't it?

292
00:19:59,577 --> 00:20:01,976
Okay, I can see why you would be,

293
00:20:01,977 --> 00:20:07,176
but why would that brat also be looking forward to it?

294
00:20:07,177 --> 00:20:09,676
I guess so.

295
00:20:09,677 --> 00:20:12,776
Come on. Never mind that already. Hurry and make dinner.

296
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:14,577
I'm starving.

297
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:24,076
Then, first for the best supporting actor award.

298
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:27,976
This year's presenter is last year's award winner,

299
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,077
Mr. Johnny Bip!

300
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:34,877
"Kudo"

301
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:44,377
Yes.

302
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:46,077
Delivery.

303
00:20:49,677 --> 00:20:51,076
Good evening.

304
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:52,676
How do you do?

305
00:20:52,677 --> 00:20:54,876
I'm Tohru Amuro.

306
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:56,776
I see...

307
00:20:56,777 --> 00:21:02,377
But, this is not our first meeting, is it?

308
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:29,776
I'd like to talk to you a bit.

309
00:22:29,777 --> 00:22:31,976
Would it be okay for me to go inside?

310
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,976
Yes, if it's just you.

311
00:22:34,977 --> 00:22:37,176
I'm sorry,

312
00:22:37,177 --> 00:22:42,376
but the others that are waiting outside are not invited in.

313
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:46,477
Because I don't think I have enough teacups to serve them tea with.

314
00:22:47,577 --> 00:22:49,676
Please don't worry about them.

315
00:22:49,677 --> 00:22:52,976
They love to wait outside.

316
00:22:52,977 --> 00:22:56,676
But depending on how you answer me.

317
00:22:56,677 --> 00:23:01,377
We may all have to barge in here.

318
00:23:04,977 --> 00:23:06,876
Raiha Pass?

319
00:23:06,877 --> 00:23:09,776
You mean we're going to the place

320
00:23:09,777 --> 00:23:11,676
where Mr. Akai was killed by them from now?

321
00:23:11,677 --> 00:23:13,076
Yes.

322
00:23:13,077 --> 00:23:15,976
I feel as if I can get a hold of something if we go.

323
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,276
Right.

324
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:21,276
The time I was informed that Kusuda shot himself...

325
00:23:21,277 --> 00:23:23,276
That facial expression.

326
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:27,776
And the total confusion during the flower viewing season.

327
00:23:27,777 --> 00:23:29,776
There's definitely something.

328
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:31,077
There's something!

329
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,277
"Raiha Pass"

330
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:45,376
