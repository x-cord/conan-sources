1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,219
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,919
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,619
A smile-less angel is the client.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,119
The Youth Detective Squad go into a mansion

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,819
and find themselves in a bizarre labyrinth.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,319
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,019
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,020
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:07,910
Hey.

10
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:10,511
Look at this lonely girl.

11
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:15,610
Hey, Conan! Come over here! Right now!

12
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:19,010
We got a client for the Youth Detective Squad!

13
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:20,711
Just come, we got a nice one.

14
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:29,910
Hey, she's really cute, isn't she?

15
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:31,110
She gives me high motivation, man.

16
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:32,411
Yeah.

17
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:44,810
"Labyrinth in the Angel's Mansion (Part 1)"

18
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:48,210
One day, this man named "Clock" came to me.

19
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:51,110
Clock, you mean, that clock?

20
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:53,010
Yes.

21
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:55,110
He doesn't have either a first or last name.

22
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:57,010
Just "Clock".

23
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,310
He is your mother's grandfather,

24
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:01,610
and your great-grandfather.

25
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:04,010
He name is Gozo Isegawa.

26
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:05,910
My great-grandfather.

27
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:07,811
I didn't know I had a great-grandfather.

28
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:13,010
With his resilience, he dominated the Japanese stock market after the war.

29
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:15,010
He was a legendary market player

30
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:18,210
who achieved numerous wealth in one generation.

31
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:19,811
People called him "Raging Bull".

32
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:24,810
However unfortunately,

33
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:26,411
last winter...

34
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:31,410
Clock.

35
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,611
Yes.

36
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:40,210
Master.

37
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:42,810
I, the Raging Bull, shall give my entire fortune

38
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:47,010
to whoever solves this riddle.

39
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:50,810
However, the time limit is 24 hours.

40
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:52,410
Once the time is over,

41
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:56,710
one will lose the right of both inheritance and challenge forever.

42
00:03:56,711 --> 00:04:00,010
The challengers will be restricted to my sons, wife,

43
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:03,410
and grandchildren, with the ones with closer blood relationship first.

44
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:07,210
And I want you to see it through.

45
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:09,711
Please, you're not dying, Master.

46
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:14,810
In the end, nobody ever visited me.

47
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:16,310
Well, one gets what one deserves,

48
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:19,710
I know that, but still, dying alone is a lonely thing.

49
00:04:19,711 --> 00:04:21,910
What the heck is my family for?

50
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:25,410
Please, calm down. You should completely rest.

51
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:28,811
The Raging Bull was a miserable cow, after all.

52
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:44,310
So, that was my great-grandfather's end.

53
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:45,311
And...

54
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:47,810
As the secretary and executor of Mr. Gozo Isegawa,

55
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:50,410
I'm here to tell you something.

56
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:52,010
Ms. Yuriko Matsunaka.

57
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:53,610
Ah, yes.

58
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:56,210
You are the one with the 17th right of inheritance.

59
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:57,910
Now it is your turn.

60
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:59,910
Me?

61
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:02,810
Of course you have the right to abstain.

62
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:04,211
It is up to you.

63
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:09,010
By the way, I have heard that the Youth Detective Squad,

64
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:12,811
the smart kids, are at the same school as yours.

65
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:16,310
That's why you asked us?

66
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:19,610
So he is actually trying not only Yuriko,

67
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,910
but us to solve the riddle.

68
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:25,310
What does your family say about that?

69
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:28,710
My father died in a car accident right after I was born.

70
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:30,710
So as my mother with a sickness last year.

71
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:32,710
So I'm the only one left.

72
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:35,411
Oh, I'm sorry.

73
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,910
All my relatives disagreed with my parents' marriage.

74
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:42,410
So they eloped and got married.

75
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:46,610
So I really don't know my relatives

76
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:49,010
and you are the only people I could talk to.

77
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:52,310
Okay. How do you feel about it now?

78
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,810
I kind of afraid.

79
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,510
But if I challenge to solve the riddle,

80
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:57,810
I can see the house that my mother

81
00:05:57,811 --> 00:06:00,510
and great-grandfather once lived together when she was young.

82
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:01,610
Mr. Clock told me that.

83
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:06,510
That house is called the Angel's Mansion.

84
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:09,810
Ms. Yuriko and the Youth Detective Squad.

85
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:11,310
Mr. Clock!

86
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:12,511
He's the man.

87
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:16,511
Pleasure to meet you all.

88
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,710
It's pretty far, isn't it?

89
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:21,611
That Angel's Mansion.

90
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:25,511
It's not far once we get out of this forest.

91
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:33,310
Oh, yes. I told your parents

92
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:36,110
that you were going to be camping tonight,

93
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:38,010
and I have already got permission from them.

94
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:39,110
-What? -What?

95
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,011
So you've done a research on us already.

96
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:47,211
It's there. Look.

97
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:59,610
That's the South Angel.

98
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:01,710
That's the West Angel.

99
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:04,010
That's the East Angel.

100
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:06,910
And that's the North Angel.

101
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:08,510
They are named this way

102
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,610
since they are located in the four cardinal points precisely.

103
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:12,710
And also...

104
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:14,110
I've heard that the statues' faces

105
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:17,910
are made to look like Mr. Isegawa's wife, who happened to die young.

106
00:07:17,911 --> 00:07:20,310
My great-grandmother?

107
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:26,510
Yes. He spent all of his earnings just to see his wife's face again.

108
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:30,410
Probably he looked like a cold father to his little sons.

109
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:33,810
They left the house as soon as they became adults.

110
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:36,310
In the end, he was the only one left in the house.

111
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:39,910
Sure, his sons visited him sometimes,

112
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:42,611
but always ended up with a big fight.

113
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:47,611
It was very sad that the people couldn't understand him well.

114
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:56,610
"South Mansion" -See the house with the South Angel?

115
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:58,910
We call it the South Mansion.

116
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,210
That's where Mr. Isegawa spent his last moment.

117
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:03,610
And the East Mansion over there,

118
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:06,310
"East Mansion" -was mainly his workplace.

119
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:07,910
"North Mansion" -And that North Mansion,

120
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:11,410
was where his sons and housekeepers used to live.

121
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:14,910
No one lives there now but it still looks pretty neat.

122
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,910
I'm trying to keep it clean all the time.

123
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:19,410
What about that one though?

124
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:22,410
The East Mansion is like a haunted house.

125
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:24,510
"East Mansion" -Actually it is Mr. Isegawa's will that

126
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:27,610
nobody goes in there, so...

127
00:08:27,611 --> 00:08:28,710
Why?

128
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:30,211
I have no idea.

129
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,610
What is that?

130
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:35,810
Oh, that's Minotaur?

131
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:37,410
Minotaur?

132
00:08:37,411 --> 00:08:41,910
It's an imaginary monster, half human and half bull.

133
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:43,610
You're really knowledgable.

134
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:46,710
He had been called "Raging Bull".

135
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:49,510
What else could decorate this house better?

136
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:55,610
Oh, yeah. There are bull everywhere!

137
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:59,210
In the stock market, the bull is a symbol of power.

138
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:02,010
You can find statues of bulls in Wall Street, New York,

139
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:03,710
which is the center of the stock market.

140
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:07,211
Bulls are like guardian angels for market players.

141
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:11,010
What's that?

142
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:14,310
It's one of the security systems Mr. Isegawa left.

143
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:17,811
It starts up automatically when the sun sets.

144
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:27,210
Even after Mr. Isegawa passed away?

145
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:32,010
Right. Until somebody solves his riddle and finds the treasures.

146
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:33,610
The security is going to be on.

147
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:35,710
And so am I.

148
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:37,611
The angel is scary.

149
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:43,610
It's an Angel's mansion under the daylight

150
00:09:43,611 --> 00:09:45,810
and a witch's mansion under the moonlight, I guess.

151
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:48,611
There are two faces.

152
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:56,311
"Mansion of the Raging Bull."

153
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:00,410
Don't worry! I'm with you!

154
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:02,610
Me too! Kind of.

155
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:05,910
Here is the fifth mansion, the "Mansion of the Raging Bull".

156
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:08,910
We are at the center of Mr. Isegawa's property.

157
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:12,510
So my mother was living in this house, right?

158
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,110
After your parents left the mansion,

159
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:17,010
Mr. Isegawa was always worried about them,

160
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:20,010
so he would always visit this place alone.

161
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:22,210
Hey, Mr. Clock.

162
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:24,110
I think it's time for you to tell us

163
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:27,310
about the riddle Mr. Isegawa left behind.

164
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:31,010
Right. That's what we're here for.

165
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:34,610
I'm sorry but it's not time yet, so please.

166
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:39,011
I guess time really matters in this riddle, doesn't it?

167
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:45,510
Well, it's time for me to serve you dinner.

168
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,610
To the North Mansion, please.

169
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:50,411
"North Mansion"

170
00:10:58,011 --> 00:11:00,410
I'm stuffed!

171
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,011
Yeah, it was delicious.

172
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:07,611
Now it's time.

173
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:11,310
Here is the riddle Mr. Isegawa left behind.

174
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:12,411
-What? -What?

175
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:20,210
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head,"

176
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:23,410
"an angel will come down and play the flute."

177
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:26,810
"The song of the angel is my very treasure."

178
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,410
That's all?

179
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:30,110
Yes.

180
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:33,510
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head,"

181
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:36,410
"an angel will come down and play the flute."

182
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:38,210
And...

183
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:41,710
"The song of the angel is my very treasure."

184
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:44,010
24 hours from now.

185
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:46,810
So the time limit is 9 pm tomorrow.

186
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:49,511
More important is, which bull he's talking about?

187
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:55,910
Now, please, be careful.

188
00:11:55,911 --> 00:12:01,110
Some of the security systems are actually quite dangerous.

189
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:04,210
I've seen the previous challengers getting severely injured.

190
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:06,711
Some of them have never returned.

191
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:17,011
Keep in mind, this Angel's Mansion is a huge labyrinth.

192
00:12:25,115 --> 00:12:26,414
That must be it.

193
00:12:26,415 --> 00:12:29,314
That humongous bull gotta be the one, man!

194
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,514
Yeah, it could be.

195
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:33,714
But shouldn't we go with everybody else?

196
00:12:33,715 --> 00:12:37,314
Hey, you'll never beat Conan if you're like that.

197
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:40,414
That bull's gotta be the one in Gozo's riddle!

198
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:42,515
But, Genta...

199
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:48,314
That bull looks to be raging, you know.

200
00:12:48,315 --> 00:12:51,315
I'm gonna find the treasure map inside its horn, and then...

201
00:12:53,715 --> 00:12:55,315
Genta, you're amazing!

202
00:12:56,915 --> 00:12:58,214
Yuriko.

203
00:12:58,215 --> 00:13:00,514
I don't think it's that simple.

204
00:13:00,515 --> 00:13:02,114
"Mansion of the Raging Bull" -We should go with the boys.

205
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,814
It's dangerous.

206
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:05,214
Yeah, but did you see Yuriko's face?

207
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:07,614
She didn't show a smile, not even once.

208
00:13:07,615 --> 00:13:09,314
She's really sad.

209
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:11,714
I want to solve this riddle her great-grandfather left her,

210
00:13:11,715 --> 00:13:13,414
so she can smile again.

211
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:16,314
All right, then how come you are not checking this bull?

212
00:13:16,315 --> 00:13:18,315
Because I'm scared.

213
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:24,414
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head."

214
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:26,815
"When the bull's horn disappears..."

215
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,715
It disappeared!

216
00:13:30,515 --> 00:13:31,614
What?

217
00:13:31,615 --> 00:13:33,815
Ai, you're fantastic!

218
00:13:38,715 --> 00:13:41,014
I get it! It must be the West Angel

219
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:42,815
that's coming down, isn't it?

220
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:50,115
Ayumi and Ai are saying that the West Angel is the one.

221
00:13:51,615 --> 00:13:53,714
We need to be the director to our original goals.

222
00:13:53,715 --> 00:13:55,014
Director?

223
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:58,014
Director from where?

224
00:13:58,015 --> 00:13:59,714
You don't know?

225
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:02,414
It means to achieve the original intentions.

226
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:05,715
It should be carry out through to our original goals, Genta.

227
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:09,214
But as a matter of fact,

228
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,414
I smell something fishy from the East Mansion.

229
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:17,914
It is Mr. Isegawa's will that nobody goes in there, so...

230
00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:20,014
Maybe the riddle is a lie

231
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:23,014
and the treasures are in the East Mansion?

232
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:25,015
Genta.

233
00:14:32,615 --> 00:14:34,615
"East Mansion."

234
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:46,214
Thank you, Mitsuhiko.

235
00:14:46,215 --> 00:14:47,515
No problem.

236
00:14:57,215 --> 00:14:58,315
What is this thing?

237
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:03,015
"West Angel."

238
00:15:03,515 --> 00:15:04,515
Hey.

239
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:06,114
Ai.

240
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:10,014
How should we make the angel come down?

241
00:15:10,015 --> 00:15:13,215
That is what we are trying to find out.

242
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:15,415
Watch out!

243
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:18,315
Electric shock.

244
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:23,514
Ai?

245
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:25,815
I guess we better go back.

246
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:34,114
AS I expected, it is at the East Mansion.

247
00:15:34,115 --> 00:15:36,015
The treasures is somewhere in here.

248
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:42,014
This bull has no horns!

249
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:43,715
"When the bull's horn disappears"...

250
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,214
"The tail becomes the head".

251
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:52,714
The tail is the head...

252
00:15:52,715 --> 00:15:53,915
Head?

253
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:06,714
Why aren't you moving?

254
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:10,315
You! Cow!

255
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:15,114
Oh, my God!

256
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:16,814
Help!

257
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:18,515
Somebody help!

258
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:34,814
Hello, anybody?

259
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,515
Is anybody here?

260
00:16:50,915 --> 00:16:52,215
Mitsuhiko!

261
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:55,814
Mr. Clock. Genta!

262
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,014
You have to believe this.

263
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:59,214
I found human bones in there.

264
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:00,814
Bones?

265
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:02,114
Is that true?

266
00:17:02,115 --> 00:17:05,214
I guess that's how rats end up in this labyrinth.

267
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:08,214
Yeah, but aren't you supposed to call the police?

268
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:10,714
Certainly, I will.

269
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:15,115
Now you, focus on what you have to do. Time is money.

270
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:18,815
"North Mansion."

271
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:22,114
Where's everyone?

272
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:23,814
They said they're going to the washroom.

273
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:25,815
It's been too long.

274
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,614
Yuriko?

275
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:32,814
I can't sleep.

276
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:34,914
So I'm gonna go for a little walk, okay?

277
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:37,714
But...

278
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:40,015
Don't worry. Just for a while.

279
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:49,014
In the end, nobody ever visited me.

280
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:52,515
Dying alone is a lonely thing.

281
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:09,814
Where is this?

282
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:11,114
Conan?

283
00:18:11,115 --> 00:18:12,814
Oh! I'm going to pee in my pants!

284
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:14,515
Mr. Clock, where's the washroom?

285
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:17,515
Come here!

286
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:34,714
I don't know if we should trust what Mr. Clock told us.

287
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:36,514
What do you mean?

288
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,614
You know, this Gozo guy left the riddle,

289
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:43,314
Yuriko was the 17th challenger. Things like that.

290
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:44,814
That's make sense.

291
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:49,014
There have been 16 challengers in the past few months,

292
00:18:49,015 --> 00:18:52,414
but nobody left a memo or whatsoever.

293
00:18:52,415 --> 00:18:53,714
It is strange.

294
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,214
Yeah. Maybe this "riddle" thing is a lie

295
00:18:56,215 --> 00:19:01,214
and is something he used to get Yuriko to come here.

296
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:03,214
Getting her to come here and then what?

297
00:19:03,215 --> 00:19:04,514
Yeah.

298
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:08,314
Actually, I don't know.

299
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:11,914
I don't think Mr. Clock was lying.

300
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:13,714
Just my guess.

301
00:19:13,715 --> 00:19:15,514
That's one sure thing.

302
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:18,414
Even if the previous challengers left some kind of hint to the riddle,

303
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:21,414
that Clock guy could've cleaned them all up.

304
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:24,314
For the sake of being fair to all the challengers?

305
00:19:24,315 --> 00:19:25,514
Yeah.

306
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:28,815
But the thing is what does he gain from doing so?

307
00:19:37,815 --> 00:19:40,514
Shoots! 10 hours left.

308
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:41,814
I'm so sorry.

309
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:44,914
For causing you a trouble. Maybe I should just...

310
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:49,414
Don't you worry, Yuriko.

311
00:19:49,415 --> 00:19:53,114
There're still many other bulls to see!

312
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:54,414
We got 10 hours.

313
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:57,915
It's long enough for me to break all the horns!

314
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:03,114
Wait a minute. Why is it the Bull?

315
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:05,614
And why does it have to be the horn?

316
00:20:05,615 --> 00:20:10,314
Simple. Yuriko's great-granddad was called "Raging Bull".

317
00:20:10,315 --> 00:20:12,514
And, there's a bull with horns,

318
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:14,614
which Genta got hanged on last night

319
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:16,714
in the Mansion of the Raging Bull.

320
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,414
And there's a gold bull with no horns in the East Mansion,

321
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:22,614
where Mitsuhiko pissed in his pants, right?

322
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:25,914
What are you talking about?

323
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:28,014
I didn't pee in my pants!

324
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:29,814
The "bull" in riddle does not refer

325
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:32,715
to any of the bulls in this mansion. That is...

326
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:37,714
"Bull" -A kanji character?

327
00:20:37,715 --> 00:20:40,614
"The bull's horn disappears", that means...

328
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,114
"Noon."

329
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,714
Sheep?

330
00:20:43,715 --> 00:20:45,614
Oh, please, Genta!

331
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:48,014
It's "Go". Like when you write "noon" in Japanese.

332
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:50,214
In the Chinese zodiac, it means "horse".

333
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:53,014
Horse? There's no horse in here.

334
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:54,714
It's not just animal.

335
00:20:54,715 --> 00:20:57,314
This "horse" also indicates a direction.

336
00:20:57,315 --> 00:20:59,214
And one more thing.

337
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:00,415
Shoots!

338
00:21:03,815 --> 00:21:05,014
"South Angel."

339
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,714
The South Angel.

340
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:08,714
Horse is the symbol of the south.

341
00:21:08,715 --> 00:21:11,514
You have to be careful. There's an electric shock security system.

342
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:14,514
No, there's no electric shock if I'm right.

343
00:21:14,515 --> 00:21:18,114
Because the character of "horse" also means 12 pm.

344
00:21:18,115 --> 00:21:20,715
Like the word "Go" that means noon.

345
00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:29,515
It's opened!

346
00:21:42,815 --> 00:21:45,414
It's weird. It's glued onto the floor.

347
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:46,715
Why?

348
00:21:52,815 --> 00:21:55,714
Is that the Raging Bull's treasure?

349
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:59,914
No, this black crystal is the key to solve the next riddle.

350
00:21:59,915 --> 00:22:03,014
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head."

351
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:06,314
It means the opposite of "horse" which is "rat",

352
00:22:06,315 --> 00:22:08,414
and the direction of the "rat" is north!

353
00:22:08,415 --> 00:22:11,815
There must be something in the North Angel Tower!

354
00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:16,915
What are you doing?

355
00:22:19,015 --> 00:22:21,514
That's it! Guys, get off the floor...

356
00:22:21,515 --> 00:22:23,115
Yuriko!

357
00:23:57,415 --> 00:24:00,014
"Next Episode" -You found human bones

358
00:24:00,015 --> 00:24:01,414
in the East Mansion, right?

359
00:24:01,415 --> 00:24:03,515
Which direction was the head facing?

360
00:24:04,615 --> 00:24:08,214
Maybe the thief wandered through this tunnel and ended up there.

361
00:24:08,215 --> 00:24:10,314
The time is over now, isn't it?

362
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,815
No, I just solved the second riddle.

363
00:24:15,515 --> 00:24:16,715
You wanna fight?

364
00:24:20,015 --> 00:24:21,814
Stop!

365
00:24:21,815 --> 00:24:27,415
Next Conan, "Labyrinth in the Angel's Mansion (Part 2)"

366
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,214
Next Conan's Hint:

367
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:47,314
"Direction"

368
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:49,014
I'm going to solve the mystery then Yuriko and I will...

369
00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:50,214
What are you saying, Genta?

370
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:51,215
That's a lot of bulls.

371
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:52,415
I'm fired up!
