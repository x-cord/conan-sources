1
00:00:01,313 --> 00:00:02,713
Due to Ran's absence,

2
00:00:02,713 --> 00:00:06,113
Pops and I end up eating out for dinner.

3
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:07,313
After seeing some flyers,

4
00:00:07,313 --> 00:00:10,713
we decided to head to Haido City for ramen.

5
00:00:10,713 --> 00:00:11,913
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For" "Ramen Ogura"

6
00:00:11,913 --> 00:00:14,813
Flaunting a "So Good it's to Die For" slogan,

7
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:17,613
will this shabby-looking shop really be all right?

8
00:00:17,613 --> 00:00:21,013
And yet, Mr. Saizu, a customer who arrived after us

9
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:24,813
was a real estate agent who plotted to land-shark this shopping street.

10
00:00:24,813 --> 00:00:28,113
Alienated owner Ogura, assistant Sayo,

11
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:31,613
and the adjacent barbershop manager Taninaka,

12
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:33,113
he had soured the atmosphere.

13
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:37,213
Despite its shabby appearance and a hostile atmosphere,

14
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:39,813
the shop's ramen was one-of-a-kind.

15
00:00:39,813 --> 00:00:45,013
The slogan "So Good it's to Die For" was true to its words.

16
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:48,213
However, after eating some of the ramen,

17
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:49,813
Mr. Saizu suddenly let out on anguished cry.

18
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:51,613
And actually, died.

19
00:00:53,113 --> 00:00:56,213
The cause of death was hydrocyanic poisoning.

20
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:58,513
Was this murder?

21
00:00:58,513 --> 00:01:02,913
If so, the culprit would have to be someone in this shop.

22
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:26,213
If all cases were men,

23
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:27,913
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

24
00:01:27,913 --> 00:01:29,613
Inspiration hits upon entering the shop.

25
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:31,613
The Death Lord ramen shall speak of the truth.

26
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:33,213
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:35,013
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:37,313
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

29
00:03:01,337 --> 00:03:06,537
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For (Part 2)"

30
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:10,737
Inspector.

31
00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:15,237
How'd it go? The investigation?

32
00:03:16,337 --> 00:03:20,337
No poison was detected inside the ramen in question.

33
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:24,437
Of course none was found in the water the victim drank

34
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,537
or on the decorative flowers at the victim's seat,

35
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:30,037
or the glass they were arranged in.

36
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:34,037
Which means Sayo and I are cleared from suspicion, right?

37
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:35,637
However...

38
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:38,937
On the thumb and index finger of the victim's left hand.

39
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:40,537
And on the chopsticks the victim used,

40
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:43,237
as well as atop the table at his seat,

41
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:45,137
toxicity tests came back positive.

42
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:49,537
Well, the poison detected on the chopsticks

43
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:50,937
and on the table were just a slight amount, though...

44
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:54,237
Also we found the same toxic powder

45
00:03:54,237 --> 00:03:57,037
from the inside pocket of the victim's jacket.

46
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,137
Would you have any clues?

47
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:03,137
Such as, if you had seen Mr. Saizu put his hand in his inside pocket.

48
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:06,337
Well, can't say that I have.

49
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:09,837
But if so, wouldn't that man have applied the poison

50
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:11,437
on his finger himself and licked it?

51
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:13,637
That reminds me, Mr. Saizu,

52
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:15,137
remarked before he collapsed...

53
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:17,437
"My company is going down in flames,

54
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:20,037
that it makes me feel like dying."

55
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:21,137
Now that you mention it,

56
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:23,737
that punk also went on about how he should poison our ramen

57
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:25,337
and destroy our shop.

58
00:04:25,337 --> 00:04:27,037
That's it.

59
00:04:27,037 --> 00:04:28,937
Bet he was trying to put poison in ramen

60
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:31,237
but ended up accidentally ingesting it.

61
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:34,637
It seems that the possibility of this being a suicide

62
00:04:34,637 --> 00:04:36,937
-or an accident still exists. -That's true.

63
00:04:38,037 --> 00:04:39,637
Apologies, but Detective Mouri.

64
00:04:39,637 --> 00:04:40,637
Yes.

65
00:04:40,637 --> 00:04:43,537
Could you come inside and explain everything once again?

66
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:44,737
Yes, sir.

67
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:47,837
-Then I'll go too. -No, you can't.

68
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:50,037
Kids shouldn't get in the way of the work of adults.

69
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:51,237
But...

70
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:57,037
He's right, just let the detectives do their investigation.

71
00:04:57,037 --> 00:04:59,337
It's not something for a kid to see.

72
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:02,837
Then, if you all would stand by outside for a few more mimutes.

73
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:04,637
Wait.

74
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,637
So there wasn't any poison on Mr. Saizu's other belongings,

75
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:10,137
besides on his inside jacket pocket?

76
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:11,437
Right.

77
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,437
We examined his handkerchief, wallet,

78
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:15,337
cigarettes, and lighter,

79
00:05:15,337 --> 00:05:18,437
even the glass that fell to the ground, but got nothing.

80
00:05:18,437 --> 00:05:21,837
Then, was there anyone among the three

81
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:24,337
who had anything suspicious on them from the body search?

82
00:05:26,137 --> 00:05:29,237
Like a container that could've held the poison.

83
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:31,037
No, here wasn't.

84
00:05:31,037 --> 00:05:33,037
All Manager Ogure had on him

85
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:36,237
were cigarettes, a lighter, and a potable ashtray.

86
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:38,937
The part-timer, Ohashi had a cell phone,

87
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:41,837
a handkerchief, eye drops, and a purse.

88
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:43,937
Mr. Taninaka from the barbershop

89
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:47,237
only had his wallet, glasses, and the keys to his shop.

90
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:49,437
And the contents of the eye drops?

91
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:51,537
We did examine that,

92
00:05:51,537 --> 00:05:53,637
but they were just ordinary eye drops.

93
00:05:53,637 --> 00:05:56,237
Incidentally, manager Ogura's cigarettes

94
00:05:56,237 --> 00:05:58,737
were just enough for a quick puff after closing.

95
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:01,137
And Mr. Taninaka's glasses are apparently reading glasses

96
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:03,037
that he seldom wears.

97
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:06,037
And by the way, when Mr. Saizu collapsed,

98
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:07,537
Mr. Ogura said,

99
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:11,137
"Idiot, think we've gonna fall for that same trick again?"

100
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,537
But have there been other cases like this?

101
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:16,837
Yes, seems it has happened twice.

102
00:06:16,837 --> 00:06:20,037
The first time,

103
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:24,337
Ms. Ohashi called an ambulance and it caused a big commotion.

104
00:06:24,337 --> 00:06:27,037
But it was deemed a malingering by the hospital.

105
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:31,937
The second time, Mr. Ogura and Mr. Taninaka who happened to be there

106
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:34,037
threw a collapsed customer out of the shop.

107
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:35,637
And that customer picked himself up,

108
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:37,737
cursed them and left.

109
00:06:39,337 --> 00:06:41,437
Well, I was told that these two customers

110
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:45,137
were both hired by Mr. Saizu to cause trouble.

111
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:50,437
Then, I'll go back inside and continue with the investigation.

112
00:06:50,437 --> 00:06:52,137
Hold on, wait.

113
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:54,437
I still have questions to ask you...

114
00:06:57,437 --> 00:06:59,237
Hey, not again.

115
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:01,537
I told you to wait outside.

116
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:04,437
Boy, you've watched too many mystery dramas.

117
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:08,237
Think you're like the young Kobayashi of the Boy Detective's Squad?

118
00:07:08,237 --> 00:07:12,537
No, rather than young Kobayashi,

119
00:07:12,537 --> 00:07:14,637
I feel like t Kogoro Akechi,

120
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:17,037
who has seen right through the truth.

121
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:23,237
Well, according to our investigation,

122
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:27,837
there was no poison inside of the ramen the deceased Saizu ate.

123
00:07:27,837 --> 00:07:31,737
Neither did the water nor the glass that was brought to him

124
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:35,737
before he ordered ramen.

125
00:07:35,737 --> 00:07:37,637
Nor the decorative flowers on the seat where Mr. Saizu sat,

126
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:40,137
nor the glass they were arranged in.

127
00:07:40,137 --> 00:07:41,937
Poison was detected, however,

128
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:46,537
on the left-handed Saizu's left thumb and left index finger.

129
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:50,337
Although there was also poison detected on the chopsticks he used

130
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,737
and on the tabletop where he sat,

131
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,037
we can exclude those due to the minute amount found.

132
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:56,837
Also out of Mr. Saizu's belongings,

133
00:07:56,837 --> 00:07:58,237
no poison was on his handkerchief, wallet,

134
00:07:58,237 --> 00:08:02,037
glasses, cigarettes, or lighter.

135
00:08:02,037 --> 00:08:06,837
But we found powdered poison in his inside jacket pocket.

136
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:09,337
Further, the fact that before Mr. Saizu died,

137
00:08:09,337 --> 00:08:11,237
he said things like, "I feel like dying"

138
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:14,937
and "I'll destroy this shop by poisoning the ramen",

139
00:08:14,937 --> 00:08:16,537
if we take those into account,

140
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,537
Mr. Saizu would've most likely

141
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:21,137
touched the poison he put in his inside jacket pocket,

142
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:22,537
and either committed suicide

143
00:08:22,537 --> 00:08:26,937
or was plotting to lace the ramen with poison.

144
00:08:26,937 --> 00:08:29,937
Thus, this case is not a homicide.

145
00:08:29,937 --> 00:08:31,937
Inspector.

146
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:35,137
Other than on Saizu's fingers,

147
00:08:35,137 --> 00:08:37,937
wasn't there poison on the chopsticks and table?

148
00:08:37,937 --> 00:08:40,737
In that case, wouldn't it be too early

149
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:42,637
to determine that it wasn't a homicide?

150
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:45,237
Saizu was sitting at the seat of the regular customer

151
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:47,037
who died a short while ago.

152
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:49,037
And it seems that Saizu often purposely sat at that seat

153
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:52,337
as a form of harassment, so...

154
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:56,037
Even if his seat could've been predicted in advance,

155
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,937
the conclusion is the same.

156
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,437
I already said this,

157
00:08:59,437 --> 00:09:01,537
but the amount of poison detected on the chopsticks

158
00:09:01,537 --> 00:09:03,237
and table was insignificant.

159
00:09:03,237 --> 00:09:04,537
We've no choice but to think he touched those

160
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:06,937
with his poison-laced hand.

161
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:08,837
Not to mention, the other chopsticks

162
00:09:08,837 --> 00:09:11,637
in the chopstick stand had no poison on them, right?

163
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:14,537
It would've been impossible to pinpoint

164
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:16,237
a place on the chopsticks or table for the victim to touch.

165
00:09:16,237 --> 00:09:18,537
Good point.

166
00:09:21,837 --> 00:09:23,737
Ramen...

167
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:25,237
pardon me...

168
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:30,037
Detective Mouri?

169
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:34,337
He's gotten into his usual trance-like state.

170
00:09:34,337 --> 00:09:37,137
It's just me putting him to sleep with my tranquilizer gun.

171
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:39,337
Hey, is he all right?

172
00:09:39,337 --> 00:09:42,037
His dizziness looked pretty awful, didn't it?

173
00:09:42,037 --> 00:09:45,837
Almost as if he was a puppet who had his strings cut.

174
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:48,837
Right, a puppet indeed.

175
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:50,437
I didn't mean me,

176
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:53,437
but Mr. Saizu did have someone pulling his strings.

177
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:55,537
From the time he entered this shop,

178
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:58,137
it was as if he'd been possessed by a devil

179
00:09:58,137 --> 00:10:00,037
to apply poison to his own fingers,

180
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:02,637
and then bring it to his mouth.

181
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:06,737
Just as the culprit among us expected.

182
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:10,537
Are you telling me that one of these three

183
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:13,037
is a hypnotist or something of the sort?

184
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:17,237
No, to say that he had been possessed by a devil was just a metaphor.

185
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:20,337
The truth is the culprit took advantage

186
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:22,037
of the fact that people under a certain condition

187
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:25,937
would invariably do something specific upon entering a ramen shop.

188
00:10:27,137 --> 00:10:29,737
Invariably do something specific?

189
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:32,337
Don't tell me you mean every customer that enters a ramen shop

190
00:10:32,337 --> 00:10:36,037
will put their hand into their inside jacket pocket.

191
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:37,737
The poison in his inside pocket

192
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,137
was a fake planted by the culprit,

193
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:41,637
in order to make it look like a suicide.

194
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:42,937
The culprit probably prepared

195
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:46,637
something very similar to one of Saizu's belongings.

196
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:48,037
Applied poison on it,

197
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:51,837
and switched the two during the confusion after the incident.

198
00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:53,837
By "switched" you mean...

199
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:57,637
I bet the culprit still has it on him.

200
00:10:57,637 --> 00:11:01,237
Mr. Saizu's belongings with the poison on them.

201
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:05,837
Then, we'll check them again.

202
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:07,337
There's a way to figure it out soon

203
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:08,937
even without doing that.

204
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:15,737
Just have them use these items the same way Mr. Saizu did.

205
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:17,137
I see.

206
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:19,237
If forced to use an item of Mr. Saizu's,

207
00:11:19,237 --> 00:11:21,137
which the culprit wasn't used to using,

208
00:11:21,137 --> 00:11:23,637
they'd likely give themselves away, yes?

209
00:11:23,637 --> 00:11:27,737
Right. If I recall, all three people have something

210
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:30,737
that duplicated what Mr. Saizu had.

211
00:11:32,137 --> 00:11:34,837
Mr. Ogura had cigarettes and a lighter.

212
00:11:34,837 --> 00:11:36,937
Sayo had a handkerchief...

213
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:39,637
Mr. Taninaka had a wallet and glasses.

214
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,466
Then...

215
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:50,966
Let's have Mr. Ogura light one of his cigarettes,

216
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:53,166
Sayo fold your handkerchief

217
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:57,566
and Mr. Taninaka, for the time being, put on your glasses.

218
00:11:57,566 --> 00:12:00,366
Of course, in the same manner as the left-handed Mr. Saizu.

219
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:01,766
With your left hands.

220
00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:04,966
All right, everyone, if you would please.

221
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:09,666
But, see here...

222
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,366
You said the culprit would be revealed this away, but...

223
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:15,066
Since we're originally right-handed...

224
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:18,466
There's no way we could do it well with our left hands.

225
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,966
What's the matter, sir?

226
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:23,866
Your glasses are crooked?

227
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:25,166
Like I said,

228
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,966
I can't really put them on correctly with my left hand.

229
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:30,966
It's because you're not firmly holding the connective point

230
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:34,066
where the frame and temple meet, like this.

231
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:36,366
So can you try putting them on again?

232
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,666
I've got no choice.

233
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:44,266
There you go again.

234
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:47,266
You're grabbing onto the end of the temple.

235
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:51,066
Why aren't you holding over here?

236
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:53,466
It's just...

237
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:55,166
Or...

238
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,666
You just won't hold it there?

239
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,266
Since that's where the poison is?

240
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,966
Officer Takagi, check those glasses.

241
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:07,466
Yes, sir.

242
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:10,466
If you would please...

243
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:17,366
But, isn't this strange?

244
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:18,766
Since Taninaka came into this shop,

245
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:22,766
he never even came close to Saizu.

246
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:24,366
That's right.

247
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,766
In between Mr. Taninaka and that man was the little boy's group,

248
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:31,066
there's no way he could've ever touched,

249
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:33,766
or even come close to that man, is there?

250
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:36,966
So, how on earth could he have laced poison onto his glasses?

251
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:38,066
She's right.

252
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:41,966
True, it would've been difficult for him to do so here.

253
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:44,366
But if Mr. Taninaka did it in his barbershop,

254
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,566
it would've been an easy task.

255
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:50,466
Come to think of it, he did say this.

256
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:53,966
That Mr. Saizu had his hair cut at Taninaka's barbershop

257
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,766
just before he came here to eat ramen.

258
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:57,966
Yes.

259
00:13:57,966 --> 00:14:00,966
At a barbershop, it's only natural for the barber

260
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,766
to hold onto your glasses and jacket

261
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:05,066
while your hair is being cut.

262
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:08,366
Mr. Taninaka would've had enough opportunities

263
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:13,566
to poison his glasses and plant poison in his jacket.

264
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:15,366
No way.

265
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:17,866
We'll concede for argument's sake,

266
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:20,966
but how the heck was he able to make Saizu touch it?

267
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:23,966
Since it wasn't like he was hypnotized or anything,

268
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:26,166
no way he'd so conveniently touch it.

269
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,066
He definitely would touch it!

270
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:34,066
Hey, when in the world did you get outside?

271
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:38,066
Because a person wearing glasses...

272
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:41,066
walk into ramen shops or warm places,

273
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:42,366
immediately...

274
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:46,166
this will happen.

275
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:49,566
Condensation?

276
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,866
And, if your glasses cloud up,

277
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:58,766
normally you'll do this.

278
00:14:58,766 --> 00:14:59,966
I see.

279
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,666
If his glasses clouded up due to condensation,

280
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,666
he would've taken them off in order to wipe them

281
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,866
with a handkerchief or something.

282
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:08,666
That's when the poison got onto his finger.

283
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,966
However, Mr. Saizu was left-handed.

284
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:14,166
If he took his handkerchief and wiped his glasses using his left hand,

285
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,666
poison should've also gotten on to his handkerchief.

286
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,566
Mr. Saizu was ambidextrous.

287
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:24,566
He said that his parents tried to correct his left-handedness.

288
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:28,466
That's why he used his right hand to wipe the spilled water on the table.

289
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:31,966
But he wasn't comfortable unless he ate using his left hand.

290
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:35,766
In short, when Mr. Saizu entered this shop,

291
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:38,566
he took out his handkerchief with his right hand

292
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:41,566
and wiped his glasses.

293
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:45,866
Not at all expecting that poison had been applied to his glasses.

294
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:49,466
But, if he had used his left hand

295
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:51,266
to take out his handkerchief...

296
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:52,866
That's possible.

297
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:54,166
Since Saizu was ambidextrous,

298
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,566
there's an equal chance for him to use either hand to take it out.

299
00:15:56,566 --> 00:16:02,466
No, the handkerchief was inside his jacket's left chest pocket.

300
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:04,266
Since he's ambidextrous he'd use his right hand

301
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:07,266
to take it out since it'd be easier.

302
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,966
As for the tabletop having traces of poison,

303
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:11,666
it was because he touched it with his left hand

304
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,266
while seating himself.

305
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,266
Then, as he was ready to eat ramen

306
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,466
and took chopsticks from the chopstick stand,

307
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:20,966
some poison also got on there.

308
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:23,866
As he used his mouth to split apart the chopsticks,

309
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:26,666
poison stuck onto his lips and teeth.

310
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,166
As soon as he slurped up his ramen,

311
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:33,266
the poison entered his system just like that.

312
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:37,566
Incidentally, the reason Mr. Taninaka passed the chopsticks to us

313
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:40,166
is because he didn't want Mr. Saizu to do so.

314
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:44,666
If he had used his poisoned hand to pass the chopsticks to us,

315
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:48,166
we might have also been poisoned to death.

316
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,266
So, you're saying that he came to the shop

317
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:53,466
to make sure no innocent customers would get dragged into it?

318
00:16:53,466 --> 00:16:55,566
But, wait...

319
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:58,866
Just when could Taninaka have switched the glasses?

320
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:00,766
If he hadn't switched them,

321
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:02,466
the trick would've been disclosed in no time.

322
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:04,466
Switching the glasses was done

323
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:08,166
when Mr. Ogura and Mr. Taninaka

324
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,766
were about to throw the collapsed Saizu out of the shop.

325
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:13,966
At the time, Mr. Saizu collapsed,

326
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,966
the glasses flew to the ground near his legs.

327
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:19,366
We squatted near Saizu's legs

328
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:22,166
in order to lift the lower part of the body.

329
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,866
As for Mr. Taninaka,

330
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:25,366
he had the opportunity to switch the glasses

331
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:26,766
and block our view with his body.

332
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:32,066
But, wasn't it only by chance that his glasses flew off?

333
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:33,966
If his glasses had remained firmly on his face,

334
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:36,966
wouldn't it have been difficult to switch them?

335
00:17:36,966 --> 00:17:41,566
Of the two incidents of food poisoning that had occurred in this shop...

336
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:42,966
The second time,

337
00:17:42,966 --> 00:17:45,266
Mr. Ogura and Mr. Taninaka threw the customer

338
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:49,166
who had pretended to have food poisoning out of the shop.

339
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,366
So this time, he could predict

340
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:55,366
that Mr. Ogura would do the same thing when Saizu collapsed.

341
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,166
He knew that Mr. Ogura would ask him to help

342
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,566
throw Saizu out into the street.

343
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:01,166
This time, it was by luck

344
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,566
that a detective drama-obsessed brat with glasses blurted out,

345
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:05,966
"Don't touch the body."

346
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:08,066
But had it not been for that,

347
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:09,766
he would have plenty of chances to switch them.

348
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:11,966
After they cast him out of the shop,

349
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,066
he could fetch the glasses that had fallen to the ground

350
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:17,666
or he could rush to the unresponsive Mr. Saizu and do it.

351
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,366
Inspector Megure.

352
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:25,166
The glasses Taninaka had on him tested positive for poison.

353
00:18:26,866 --> 00:18:29,166
It appears that we've obtained

354
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:32,166
conclusive evidence against you, Mr. Taninaka.

355
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:35,666
Hold on.

356
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,666
There's some kind of mistake.

357
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,266
That's right.

358
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:41,666
Mr. Taninaka wouldn't kill anyone.

359
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,666
That's enough, you two.

360
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:48,166
I don't deserve the privilege of your defense.

361
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,266
-What? -What?

362
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:53,466
To kill Saizu in this shop

363
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:57,066
and hopefully thereby ruin this shop was my plan.

364
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:01,366
I thought that no one would come to a ramen shop

365
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:03,566
where someone had been poisoned to death.

366
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:06,566
But... why'd you do that?

367
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:10,566
Haven't we gotten by pretty well these twenty years as neighbors?

368
00:19:12,266 --> 00:19:14,566
Gotten by pretty well?

369
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:16,666
In these past 20 years,

370
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,066
just what have you achieved?

371
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:22,766
We worked our rears and souls off in order to raise money,

372
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:28,666
all for the sake of making this Haido Shopping Street a stylish place.

373
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:32,266
But you haven't remodeled your shop even once.

374
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:36,266
I told you, I don't have the money.

375
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:40,266
Horse-racing, boat-races, road races,

376
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:42,066
if you had only let up on those a little,

377
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:44,166
you could've saved up some, no?

378
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,266
That's...

379
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:48,866
If you ask my opinion,

380
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:52,866
your profit margin on the ramen was way too low.

381
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:56,566
Without raising the price, you even hired a part-time worker,

382
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:59,866
you just don't have any business sense.

383
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,966
Saizu said it, right?

384
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:05,166
That the people of the shopping street

385
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,566
were calling this shop the black sheep.

386
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:11,066
That was actually true.

387
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:13,466
They asked me many times

388
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:16,766
if I could be the one to tell you,

389
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:20,666
"Please either remodel the shop or leave".

390
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:27,066
Then, why didn't you tell us that outright?

391
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:29,766
If you had, our owner could have...

392
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:31,966
I couldn't tell you.

393
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:36,366
Because I loved the ramen here.

394
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:38,066
Without regard to profit,

395
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:40,566
you steadfastly kept the same taste and price.

396
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:43,466
Your spirit as an owner radiated.

397
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:53,366
All right, we'll get the rest at the station.

398
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:04,466
This is my heart talking now,

399
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:06,666
but I believed in you guys.

400
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:12,566
With your ramen, even if you moved elsewhere,

401
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:19,066
you'd definitely keep on prospering.

402
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:55,766
One month later,

403
00:22:55,766 --> 00:23:00,366
Barbershop Taninaka and Ramen Ogura were both demolished.

404
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:01,966
And the ramen that was so good it was to die for

405
00:23:01,966 --> 00:23:04,366
vanished from Haido City.

406
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:05,666
Then...

407
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:17,266
Hello. Hey, welcome.

408
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:18,666
It's you guys.

409
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,866
Welcome.

410
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:23,866
I hear you're a well-known detective here in Beika City.

411
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:26,266
Yes, sort of...

412
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:28,866
Shouldn't I be well-known throughout the nation?

413
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,566
Your shop is new,

414
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:34,666
but things look exactly the same as they were before.

415
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,966
Something did change.

416
00:23:35,966 --> 00:23:37,766
The signboard in front.

417
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:40,366
The owner arranged it to suit the latest trend.

418
00:23:41,566 --> 00:23:43,166
The signboard?

419
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,166
"Wicked"

420
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:52,466
"So wicked it's to die for" "Ramen Ogura"

421
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,666
"So wicked it's to die for"?

422
00:23:58,366 --> 00:24:02,666
One day, a powerful rival suddenly might appear, you know?

423
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,666
Oh, no.

424
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,766
Great moves.

425
00:24:11,966 --> 00:24:14,666
No, this was most likely...

426
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,566
Murder...

427
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:18,366
you say,

428
00:24:18,366 --> 00:24:19,666
Conan?

429
00:24:22,366 --> 00:24:23,666
Next Conan,

430
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:27,666
"Deduction Showdown at the Haunted Hotel (Part 1)"

431
00:24:43,466 --> 00:24:45,766
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:47,766
"Elevator".

433
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:49,966
In the next episode, a new detective-like character will appear.

434
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:51,166
But aren't I more than enough?

435
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,566
No, not at all, I'm a bit uneasy.
