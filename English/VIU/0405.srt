1
00:00:03,406 --> 00:00:04,905
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:04,906 --> 00:00:06,705
They can be the culprit or the actor.

3
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:08,505
Care is the key to the dying message.

4
00:00:08,506 --> 00:00:10,205
Officer Takagi is on stage.

5
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:12,005
Solve the case with smile and peace.

6
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:13,405
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:15,105
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,106 --> 00:00:17,506
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:04,863
Hello. Are you sleeping?

10
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:06,864
You're gonna catch cold.

11
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:14,264
Okay! I gotta call the ambulance!

12
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:19,364
I found a man lying on the ground!

13
00:02:20,464 --> 00:02:22,564
He's bleeding from this head!

14
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:24,763
Oh, the place?

15
00:02:24,764 --> 00:02:26,664
I think...

16
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:29,963
What's taking them so long?

17
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:33,263
Why can't they just come right away?

18
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:35,764
The hospital is right in front of the train station.

19
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:40,764
Since they are not coming, I should go and get them!

20
00:02:48,664 --> 00:02:54,464
"The Man Who Called the Ambulance."

21
00:02:54,964 --> 00:02:56,863
Yeah, that's what I mean.

22
00:02:56,864 --> 00:02:59,563
The guy who found the victim

23
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:02,363
disappeared from the site of murder.

24
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:04,663
The first person to find the victim disappeared?

25
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:09,364
I told you! He ran away right after he called 911.

26
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:11,264
What's the matter?

27
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:15,363
Is it actually me that you are talking about?

28
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:19,063
So you are the one who found the victim first? Where were you hiding?

29
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:22,763
"Hiroshi Hiromatsu (28), Comedian" -I wasn't hiding or anything.

30
00:03:22,764 --> 00:03:25,663
I left here to get the ambulance!

31
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,563
Did you really?

32
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:29,463
I don't think you needed to

33
00:03:29,464 --> 00:03:32,964
because the victim was already dead long ago.

34
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:35,563
That's right.

35
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:38,863
It seems he died immediately after being clubbed in his head.

36
00:03:38,864 --> 00:03:40,663
So I appreciate that you came here all the way but...

37
00:03:40,664 --> 00:03:41,864
I got it!

38
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:48,163
You left here to get the ambulance which in fact was unnecessary.

39
00:03:48,164 --> 00:03:49,863
It's strange, isn't it?

40
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:51,063
Name!

41
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,563
What are you talking about? How could I know that he was dead?

42
00:03:54,564 --> 00:03:55,963
Name!

43
00:03:55,964 --> 00:03:57,363
What's your name?

44
00:03:57,364 --> 00:04:00,564
Oh, it's Hiroshi Hiromatsu.

45
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:05,063
What an arrogant police officer we got.

46
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:08,363
Come on! Your name, address, age, job!

47
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:09,863
Write everything down on this!

48
00:04:09,864 --> 00:04:12,163
"Hiroshi Hiromatsu."

49
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:16,463
It's Hiroshi Hiromatsu no matter which way you read it.

50
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,164
Your name is like a tongue twister.

51
00:04:19,164 --> 00:04:22,064
What can I do? It's my name!

52
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:25,063
You're a comedian, huh?

53
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,563
I've never heard of your name before.

54
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:29,363
Well, I'm not a popular one, really.

55
00:04:29,364 --> 00:04:31,763
If this random man was the first to find the victim...

56
00:04:31,764 --> 00:04:33,463
The victim...

57
00:04:33,464 --> 00:04:35,663
I've never seen something like this before.

58
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:37,863
Peace.

59
00:04:37,864 --> 00:04:41,263
What? The smiling and peace?

60
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:43,663
What does it mean?

61
00:04:43,664 --> 00:04:44,763
Are you done?

62
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,664
-Yes. -Let's see.

63
00:04:48,364 --> 00:04:50,164
What is it?

64
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:55,063
Hey, Iwai and Hirano!

65
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:56,064
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

66
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,064
Find out as much as you can about this guy for me.

67
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:03,764
-You got it? -Yes, sir!

68
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:07,264
Sir, did I write something wrong?

69
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:15,563
It's Officer Takagi.

70
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:17,763
I'm Takagi from the metropolitan police.

71
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:19,464
Mr. Takagi!

72
00:05:20,364 --> 00:05:21,663
Hiromatsu?

73
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:24,263
I'm Sakurada from Beika East Station.

74
00:05:24,264 --> 00:05:26,563
Do you know him?

75
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:30,463
Yes, he actually helped me catch shoplifters before.

76
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,663
So, why are you here?

77
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:36,263
It happened to be me, who found the victim first.

78
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:37,663
You are the first one?

79
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:40,163
Well, maybe there was something else he did as well.

80
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:41,663
What do you mean by that?

81
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:45,863
He is suspicious about Mr. Hiromatsu.

82
00:05:45,864 --> 00:05:47,363
Conan!

83
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:49,963
So, what is it, Mr. Sakurada?

84
00:05:49,964 --> 00:05:52,963
You think Hiromatsu is the murderer?

85
00:05:52,964 --> 00:05:55,063
Suspect the first man who finds the victim.

86
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:57,063
It's the basics of investigation.

87
00:05:57,064 --> 00:05:59,663
But I did not kill the victim.

88
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:03,663
Look, I know what kind of person he is. This can't be him.

89
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:07,064
The reason I think he is the murderer is...

90
00:06:09,464 --> 00:06:11,363
I got a phone call from the police.

91
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:14,863
I'm Yukiko Yasunaga, the owner of Office Yasunaga.

92
00:06:14,864 --> 00:06:17,163
I'm Sakurada of Beika East Station.

93
00:06:17,164 --> 00:06:20,363
-And you? -You're Mr. Ryoji Mizuhara, right?

94
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:22,363
I've seen you a lot on TV drama and stuff.

95
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:24,363
Oh yeah! You're the actor!

96
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:26,163
I'm Mizuhara.

97
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:31,063
Ohkubo was the manager of Mizuhara.

98
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:32,463
Ohkubo?

99
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:35,464
Mr. Iwao Ohkubo, the victim.

100
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:38,664
I need you to identify the victim.

101
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:42,463
What the heck is this?

102
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:43,664
Smile?

103
00:06:44,664 --> 00:06:46,463
A peace sign?

104
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:47,863
Is it him?

105
00:06:47,864 --> 00:06:49,163
Yes, it is him.

106
00:06:49,164 --> 00:06:51,663
He was my manager, Mr. Ohkubo.

107
00:06:51,664 --> 00:06:54,063
Hiromatsu, what are you doing here?

108
00:06:54,064 --> 00:06:55,763
It's a long story.

109
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:58,563
Do you guys know each other?

110
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:01,463
We're living in the same apartment, right next to each other.

111
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,364
I see, I understand.

112
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:06,563
Last time we talked,

113
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:10,063
you said Mr. Ohkubo was working late last night.

114
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:13,063
He was actually in my room just a while ago.

115
00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:15,764
It was late last night when he came to my place.

116
00:07:16,864 --> 00:07:20,663
We were talking about my future plan as an actor.

117
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:22,564
It went on until midnight.

118
00:07:24,364 --> 00:07:27,363
Then, to catch the first train,

119
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,764
he left my place around 4.30am in the morning.

120
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:35,363
So, he left your apartment and headed to the station

121
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:37,564
and this was the street that he took.

122
00:07:42,864 --> 00:07:44,663
4.40am.

123
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:48,463
It was 10 minutes after he left Mr. Mizuhara's apartment.

124
00:07:48,464 --> 00:07:50,463
I assume the murder weapon was a steel pipe

125
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:53,263
although we haven't found it yet.

126
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,763
Okay then, after 20 minutes, which was 5am,

127
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:59,163
you found the victim on the street while you were jogging.

128
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:00,664
That's right.

129
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:04,363
You guys are living on 4th street.

130
00:08:04,364 --> 00:08:06,163
The train station is this way.

131
00:08:06,164 --> 00:08:09,063
And the hospital is located before the station.

132
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:12,163
So it'll be like this though it's a rough sketch.

133
00:08:12,164 --> 00:08:15,763
Mr. Takagi, since I was interrupted last time,

134
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:17,363
now it's a good time to tell you

135
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,964
the reason why I suspect Mr. Hiromatsu.

136
00:08:21,264 --> 00:08:23,263
He killed Ohkubo?

137
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:24,363
Did you?

138
00:08:24,364 --> 00:08:26,363
No, I didn't!

139
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:29,463
First of all, you were the first one to find the victim!

140
00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:31,663
There's a possibility that the murderer

141
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:35,063
left his belongings in the site of the murder.

142
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:37,863
But if he pretends that he is the first person to find the victim,

143
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:40,363
then he can make an excuse,

144
00:08:40,364 --> 00:08:43,363
saying that these things were there when he found the victim!

145
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:44,763
Yeah, but...

146
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:49,063
Second of all, you left the murder scene to get the ambulance.

147
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:51,363
You know, people usually don't do that.

148
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:57,663
Perhaps you left for some other purpose, didn't you?

149
00:08:57,664 --> 00:08:59,163
What's that supposed to mean?

150
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,664
For example...

151
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:04,564
This is Sakurada.

152
00:09:05,564 --> 00:09:07,263
The murder weapon was found?

153
00:09:07,264 --> 00:09:09,363
Yes, I'm pretty sure, sir.

154
00:09:09,364 --> 00:09:11,763
It's got some hair on it

155
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:15,363
as well as bloodstains which are still wet.

156
00:09:15,364 --> 00:09:17,463
Yes. We found it under...

157
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:20,063
Kamitakada Bridge. Just as I thought.

158
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:22,163
Good job!

159
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:24,263
Kamitakada Bridge?

160
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:28,663
That's a bridge located between this murder site and the hospital.

161
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:32,063
So, the reason why you headed to the hospital was...

162
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:35,164
Not to call the ambulance...

163
00:09:39,264 --> 00:09:41,363
but to dispose of the murder weapon.

164
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:45,163
Give me a break! Why would I have to kill him in the first place?

165
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:47,463
As to that, I already have a clue!

166
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:48,763
What?

167
00:09:48,764 --> 00:09:52,663
You said you are a comedian but not popular at all.

168
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:55,163
You knew that Mr. Ohkubo was Mr. Mizuhara's manager

169
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:58,863
and you knew that he visited Mr. Mizuhara often,

170
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:02,363
so you begged Mr. Ohkubo to give you a job.

171
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:04,163
Yet, he refused.

172
00:10:04,164 --> 00:10:05,763
You got mad, and then...

173
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:07,963
Hold on.

174
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:11,163
And you know what? The dying message the victim left

175
00:10:11,164 --> 00:10:13,363
is telling that you are the murderer!

176
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:15,263
Dying message?

177
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:16,863
What is it?

178
00:10:16,864 --> 00:10:20,163
It's how Mr. Ohkubo died. Wasn't it strange?

179
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:22,864
Smiling with a peace sign.

180
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:27,663
That was the dying message?

181
00:10:27,664 --> 00:10:29,363
Exactly, that was the murderer's name!

182
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:31,364
Here. Take a look!

183
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:36,764
"Comedian. Stage name: Smiley Peace."

184
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:40,663
Smiley Peace.

185
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:43,263
I knew you were a comedian

186
00:10:43,264 --> 00:10:45,263
but I didn't know that your stage name was this.

187
00:10:45,264 --> 00:10:47,163
Yeah, but I didn't kill him!

188
00:10:47,164 --> 00:10:48,863
Believe me, Mr. Takagi!

189
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:51,663
Hey, what about his alibi?

190
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:52,864
Oh, alibi?

191
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:57,063
If Mr. Ohkubo was killed at 4.40am,

192
00:10:57,064 --> 00:10:59,263
then I was still in my apartment.

193
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:00,763
I left there a little before 5am.

194
00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:04,064
It was right after I started jogging when I found the victim!

195
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,363
I wish you could prove that.

196
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:10,863
Yeah, but how can you prove that a man living alone

197
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:12,763
was in his room?

198
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:16,563
Oh, I remember, after Mr. Ohkubo left,

199
00:11:16,564 --> 00:11:19,864
I set the alarm clock and went to bed.

200
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:23,563
Then I heard the sound of the toilet flushing

201
00:11:23,564 --> 00:11:25,563
from the room next to mine.

202
00:11:25,564 --> 00:11:28,663
And that was 4.40am, right, Mr. Mizuhara?

203
00:11:28,664 --> 00:11:29,863
I think so.

204
00:11:29,864 --> 00:11:32,763
Now you have an alibi, Hiromatsu!

205
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:33,764
Yeah!

206
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:36,663
What's that look on his face?

207
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:40,663
Sorry. May I go home now?

208
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:44,963
Ohkubo was like a father to you. You must be shocked.

209
00:11:44,964 --> 00:11:48,163
I think you're done with Mizuhara, right?

210
00:11:48,164 --> 00:11:52,864
Well, I will have to see you some other time, but today, yes.

211
00:11:55,364 --> 00:11:58,163
May I go home too?

212
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:00,763
I haven't asked you about the situation

213
00:12:00,764 --> 00:12:03,264
when you found the dead victim, have I?

214
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,364
You're right.

215
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,864
Are you sure?

216
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,963
Got it! Thanks.

217
00:12:14,964 --> 00:12:19,764
Bad news. The alibi you stated is invalid.

218
00:12:22,064 --> 00:12:24,663
I knew you were hiding something,

219
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:26,663
so I had my officers investigate this area,

220
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:29,663
searching for some kind of clue.

221
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:32,363
And guess who was on the security camera

222
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:35,764
in the convenient store on 3rd street? You.

223
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:38,664
And the time was 4.30am.

224
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:41,563
I'm sorry!

225
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:43,563
I lied.

226
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:47,363
I left my apartment to jog before 4.30am!

227
00:12:47,364 --> 00:12:48,963
Hiromatsu.

228
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:52,963
But, if I told you the truth, I'd become the main suspect!

229
00:12:52,964 --> 00:12:55,063
So that was a lie out of desperation, huh?

230
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:58,064
That's why you had a strange look on your face.

231
00:12:58,664 --> 00:13:01,563
Maybe that was Mr. Mizuhara's imagination?

232
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:04,863
I don't know. But that was totally out of blue that he said so.

233
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:07,163
So it was just a coincidence that you lied about your alibi

234
00:13:07,164 --> 00:13:10,463
and Mr. Mizuhara backed you up out of mistaken imagination.

235
00:13:10,464 --> 00:13:11,663
Is that what it is?

236
00:13:11,664 --> 00:13:15,863
Well, there's no need to lie if you're truly innocent.

237
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:19,363
Now, I need you to come to the station, Mr. Hiromatsu.

238
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:21,964
Oh sorry, it's Mr. Smiley Peace!

239
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:26,164
Mr. Takagi.

240
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:30,863
The motive of the murder and the disposal of the weapon

241
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:33,963
are all Mr. Sakurada's idea.

242
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:37,363
The dying message is the problem, right?

243
00:13:37,364 --> 00:13:41,163
Smiley Peace, I didn't know it was him.

244
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:44,263
I'm surprised that Mr. Ohkubo knew that name.

245
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:46,663
I didn't even know that was a stage name.

246
00:13:46,664 --> 00:13:50,163
Mr. Mizuhara knew the name only because they were neighbors, right?

247
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:52,863
I haven't seen Mr. Mizuhara on TV lately,

248
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:55,963
But he used to be on a lot of TV shows.

249
00:13:55,964 --> 00:14:00,064
With a never smile but handsome face. He was cool.

250
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:04,463
I'm worried about Hiromatsu,

251
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:07,463
so I'll go and watch the interrogation.

252
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:09,363
Smiley Peace.

253
00:14:09,364 --> 00:14:11,163
Smile with a peace sign.

254
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:12,464
Smile...

255
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:15,264
Maybe...

256
00:14:19,264 --> 00:14:20,663
You're...

257
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:22,863
I'm Conan Edogawa.

258
00:14:22,864 --> 00:14:25,263
All right, Conan, what's up?

259
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,963
Officer Takagi told me to ask you something.

260
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:31,863
It's about the conversation.

261
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:33,863
Mr. Ohkubo had with Mr. Mizuhara last night.

262
00:14:33,864 --> 00:14:37,263
You mean the future plan about Mizuhara's career.

263
00:14:37,264 --> 00:14:41,164
Yes, Officer Takagi wants to know more about this future plan in detail.

264
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:45,964
Okay, so this future plan means...

265
00:14:48,564 --> 00:14:50,263
Just as I thought!

266
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,464
Now I know what the dying message means!

267
00:14:54,064 --> 00:14:55,364
And...

268
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:59,164
the real murderer is that person!

269
00:15:04,064 --> 00:15:05,763
Ms. Yasunaga?

270
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:08,163
You mean the female owner of the production company?

271
00:15:08,164 --> 00:15:10,263
Yeah. She told me to tell you this

272
00:15:10,264 --> 00:15:12,263
because she thought it might help to solve the case.

273
00:15:12,264 --> 00:15:13,663
What?

274
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:17,364
The future plan means "smile".

275
00:15:18,064 --> 00:15:19,963
Smile?

276
00:15:19,964 --> 00:15:23,763
Ryoji Mizuhara was a cool handsome actor that never smiles.

277
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:25,263
That's how we sold him.

278
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:28,263
But that style doesn't work any more.

279
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:30,463
So, Ohkubo decided to tell him about

280
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:32,963
switching to a handsome actor with warm smiles.

281
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:35,564
That's why he visited me last night.

282
00:15:37,464 --> 00:15:39,863
I agreed with that plan,

283
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:42,864
because Mizuhara looks so sexy when he smiles.

284
00:15:43,664 --> 00:15:46,063
Switching to a smiley actor.

285
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:47,563
Yeah!

286
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:49,763
But I'm pretty sure that Mr. Mizuhara was surprised

287
00:15:49,764 --> 00:15:51,963
since he was told so out of the blue.

288
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:55,763
He was more angry than surprised,

289
00:15:55,764 --> 00:15:58,463
I think it's because he was suddenly told to be an actor

290
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:00,864
that was totally opposite what he used be, right?

291
00:16:01,564 --> 00:16:02,863
Oh no!

292
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:04,963
Also, Mr. Ohkubo

293
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,964
treated Mr. Mizuhara as if he were his own child, I heard.

294
00:16:10,064 --> 00:16:12,463
Ohkubo had a sickness actually.

295
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:13,663
What?

296
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:16,763
The doctor told him that he had only six months more to live.

297
00:16:16,764 --> 00:16:19,563
So he should've been resting in the hospital,

298
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:21,663
but he refused, and worked hard instead,

299
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:25,263
just to make his boy Mizuhara make a great comeback on TV once again,

300
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:27,863
while sacrificing his life.

301
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:30,863
He did it all for Mizuhara.

302
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,964
Sacrificed his life...

303
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:38,363
Then, I think I got the meaning of the dying message!

304
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,963
Really?

305
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:42,663
Yeah. If my deduction is correct,

306
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:45,163
then this case is a really sad one.

307
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:49,164
Right. This is not a funny case at all.

308
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:56,563
What is this? Why are you calling everyone to the murder scene?

309
00:16:56,564 --> 00:17:02,163
Listen, Mr. Sakurada, Hiromatsu did not murder Mr. Ohkubo.

310
00:17:02,164 --> 00:17:03,463
The murderer is somebody else.

311
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:05,963
First of all, about the disposal of the murder weapon.

312
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:09,963
After the murder, the killer fled from here as you can imagine.

313
00:17:09,964 --> 00:17:12,364
But which way did the killer run away?

314
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:17,163
Kamitakada Bridge, where the weapon was found, is that way.

315
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:20,763
Then, the murderer ran that way too?

316
00:17:20,764 --> 00:17:22,563
Not necessarily.

317
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:25,563
Maybe he went that way!

318
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:27,863
Criminals usually try to divert police attention

319
00:17:27,864 --> 00:17:30,563
opposite the direction that they flee.

320
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:32,963
Very simple trick though.

321
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:37,263
I see. The real murderer is someone that's living around here.

322
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,563
Wait a second.

323
00:17:38,564 --> 00:17:42,563
Mr. Mizuhara, your apartment is this way, isn't it?

324
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:43,963
Yeah.

325
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:46,663
Second of all, about establishing the alibi.

326
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:50,663
Perhaps this criminal act was a compulsive one.

327
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:54,063
Thus the murderer was not well-prepared, I assume.

328
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:57,263
But that person came up with a good idea.

329
00:17:57,264 --> 00:18:01,163
You lied about your alibi out of desperation, right?

330
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:04,563
The true murderer tried to use that lie.

331
00:18:04,564 --> 00:18:06,263
I don't get it.

332
00:18:06,264 --> 00:18:07,563
Don't you remember?

333
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:10,664
There was one person who was drawn into your lie.

334
00:18:12,164 --> 00:18:15,863
Yes. Ryoji Mizuhara!

335
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:19,764
You murdered Mr. Ohkubo.

336
00:18:20,264 --> 00:18:22,863
Then I heard the sound of the toilet flushing

337
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:24,463
from the room next to mine.

338
00:18:24,464 --> 00:18:27,863
That was neither your imagination nor misconception, right?

339
00:18:27,864 --> 00:18:31,663
By saying so, you tried to fabricate your alibi

340
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:34,563
that you were in your room at that time.

341
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:36,263
Last night, Mr. Ohkubo

342
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:40,263
made a suggestion about the future plan of your career.

343
00:18:40,264 --> 00:18:43,463
He told you that you needed to show your smile.

344
00:18:43,464 --> 00:18:46,763
But, you had always been a cool, handsome actor that didn't smile,

345
00:18:46,764 --> 00:18:49,663
and you did not want to lose this image.

346
00:18:49,664 --> 00:18:53,063
So, Mr. Ohkubo's suggestion was not one of your options.

347
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:55,763
And then you thought Mr. Ohkubo was gonna force you

348
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:59,463
to change your character even if you didn't want to. No way!

349
00:18:59,464 --> 00:19:01,064
Did it go something like this?

350
00:19:02,064 --> 00:19:04,963
I'm Ryoji Mizuhara.

351
00:19:04,964 --> 00:19:07,963
Do you think I am gonna laugh like a teenage brat?

352
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:11,263
Mizuhara, you murdered Mr. Ohkubo?

353
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:14,363
This morning, after he left your apartment,

354
00:19:14,364 --> 00:19:16,264
you followed Mr. Ohkubo.

355
00:19:28,964 --> 00:19:31,163
You are right, Officer Takagi.

356
00:19:31,164 --> 00:19:34,563
But then why did the victim die in such a strange way?

357
00:19:34,564 --> 00:19:35,964
How would you explain that?

358
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:41,263
Of course, as you thought, that was a dying message.

359
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,463
But it wasn't "Smiley Peace".

360
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:45,763
It was "smile" and "Victory sign".

361
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:48,863
It was Mr. Ohkubo's last message to you,

362
00:19:48,864 --> 00:19:52,264
whom he treated like his own child.

363
00:19:54,864 --> 00:19:57,163
Mr. Ohkubo said to you,

364
00:19:57,164 --> 00:20:00,663
Mizuhara, smile. Smile is your new style.

365
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:03,264
You look amazing when you smile.

366
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:09,763
I didn't know that.

367
00:20:09,764 --> 00:20:10,963
This can't be true!

368
00:20:10,964 --> 00:20:12,763
Who in the world would encourage someone

369
00:20:12,764 --> 00:20:14,863
that's actually trying to kill you?

370
00:20:14,864 --> 00:20:16,464
But there are people like that.

371
00:20:17,964 --> 00:20:20,063
That's how much Ohkubo cared about Mizuhara.

372
00:20:20,064 --> 00:20:23,963
He deeply cared about you, didn't you know, Mizuhara?

373
00:20:23,964 --> 00:20:27,463
He had only six months left to live.

374
00:20:27,464 --> 00:20:31,464
But he decided to sacrifice his valuable time for you.

375
00:20:35,464 --> 00:20:37,464
Mr. Ohkubo!

376
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:41,563
Mr. Ohkubo was thinking about you

377
00:20:41,564 --> 00:20:44,563
until the last moment of his life.

378
00:20:44,564 --> 00:20:48,464
You should pay for your crime and live right for him, Mr. Mizuhara.

379
00:20:49,764 --> 00:20:51,263
All right.

380
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:55,064
Let me hear your story in the station, okay?

381
00:20:56,864 --> 00:20:58,263
Mr. Sakurada!

382
00:20:58,264 --> 00:20:59,563
Huh?

383
00:20:59,564 --> 00:21:01,063
Could you...

384
00:21:01,064 --> 00:21:03,464
please apologize to Hiromatsu?

385
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,863
Please apologize that you suspected Hiromatsu!

386
00:21:08,864 --> 00:21:11,963
Yes, he did lie about his alibi.

387
00:21:11,964 --> 00:21:14,163
And lying is not a good thing.

388
00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:16,063
But it's partly your fault

389
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:18,363
because you put too much pressure on him

390
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:19,763
so that he had to lie!

391
00:21:19,764 --> 00:21:22,363
Am I wrong, Mr. Sakurada?

392
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,463
Suspect the first man who finds the victim.

393
00:21:24,464 --> 00:21:26,763
It is the basics of investigation.

394
00:21:26,764 --> 00:21:31,663
But there's a flaw that people tend to ignore in this principle too.

395
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:34,763
This applies not only to you, but me as well.

396
00:21:34,764 --> 00:21:39,163
That is, police officers must be free from prejudice!

397
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,564
No matter what!

398
00:21:42,264 --> 00:21:44,163
I understand.

399
00:21:44,164 --> 00:21:46,063
I apologize.

400
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:47,763
No, it's okay.

401
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,864
Bye.

402
00:21:51,364 --> 00:21:54,863
Thank you so much, Mr. Takagi!

403
00:21:54,864 --> 00:21:56,564
Now you are free.

404
00:21:57,464 --> 00:22:00,464
You're a man, Officer Takagi.

405
00:23:27,164 --> 00:23:29,463
Well, I thought my life was over

406
00:23:29,464 --> 00:23:32,063
when I heard that the name of the murderer

407
00:23:32,064 --> 00:23:34,763
was Smiling with a victory sign, seriously.

408
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:38,563
You should've even thought about it in the first place.

409
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:41,963
Yeah, I don't think Mr. Ohkubo knew

410
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:45,664
a comedian called "Smiley Peace" anyway.

411
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:48,363
People of the same industry don't know my name.

412
00:23:48,364 --> 00:23:51,164
That shows how unpopular I am, doesn't it?

413
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,264
Continue to try your best, Hiromatsu.

414
00:23:56,364 --> 00:24:04,663
"Next Episode."

415
00:24:04,664 --> 00:24:07,463
"Dogo Hoshikawa's Illusion Magic Show."

416
00:24:07,464 --> 00:24:08,663
Hey, Hattori.

417
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:10,963
She just changed the atmosphere, didn't she?

418
00:24:10,964 --> 00:24:12,964
Mr. Masakage.

419
00:24:20,864 --> 00:24:22,363
Next Conan,

420
00:24:22,364 --> 00:24:26,464
"Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (Tricks)"

421
00:24:42,164 --> 00:24:43,963
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:24:43,964 --> 00:24:46,263
"Secret of tricks."

423
00:24:46,264 --> 00:24:47,264
Officer Takagi, can you do some tricks?

424
00:24:47,265 --> 00:24:48,863
It's transformation. Look, 3, 2, 1.

425
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:51,564
-Grilled eel! -We're not talking about food, Genta.
