1
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:08,421
Happy New Year, everyone!

2
00:00:08,422 --> 00:00:09,521
Thanks to all of you,

3
00:00:09,522 --> 00:00:14,721
Detective Conan will be going on air for the 22nd year.

4
00:00:14,722 --> 00:00:16,221
No fair, Conan.

5
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:18,621
Let us greet the viewers too!

6
00:00:18,622 --> 00:00:19,721
Last year,

7
00:00:19,722 --> 00:00:22,722
you greeted the viewers together with Mr. Ebizo, just the two of you!

8
00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:28,821
Well, the bottom line is

9
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:31,921
I think it's best we all do the New Year's greeting together, right?

10
00:00:31,922 --> 00:00:33,422
Okay.

11
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:36,421
Here we go once more.

12
00:00:36,422 --> 00:00:39,821
Happy New Year!

13
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:43,121
Detective Conan and the Detective Squad

14
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:46,821
ask for your continued support in the year 2017 too!

15
00:00:46,822 --> 00:00:50,122
Thank you very much!

16
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:07,221
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

17
00:01:07,222 --> 00:01:09,421
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

18
00:01:09,422 --> 00:01:11,221
Conan will give it his all this year too!

19
00:01:11,222 --> 00:01:13,821
But where is this? Trouble occurs!

20
00:01:13,822 --> 00:01:15,421
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:17,421
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:17,422 --> 00:01:20,022
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:03,304
What on earth?

24
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:05,905
Why am I in a place like this?

25
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:15,005
"Conan Cornered in the Darkness (Part 1)"

26
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:21,504
I see.

27
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:23,904
It's obviously been cracked opened.

28
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:26,904
"Asada Law Firm" -You realized this morning?

29
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:27,905
"Kimihiko Asada (55)" -Yes.

30
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:33,604
"Lawyer" -But I was up all night last night working here,

31
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:37,204
so I think it was broken into

32
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:40,504
during the 1 to 2 hours that I went home to take a short nap.

33
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:41,904
I see.

34
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:44,704
And, what was in the safe?

35
00:03:44,705 --> 00:03:47,704
I don't think it was money

36
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:49,004
because instead of calling the police,

37
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:53,904
you went out of your way to call me.

38
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:56,004
Fantastic, Mr. Mouri.

39
00:03:56,005 --> 00:04:00,004
Yes, it wasn't money.

40
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:02,004
It was the will.

41
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:03,304
I see.

42
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:05,704
-I know who the perp is. -What?

43
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:09,804
But we don't want to report it to the police.

44
00:04:09,805 --> 00:04:11,805
I see.

45
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:14,304
Okay.

46
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:17,104
My eyes are getting used to the dark.

47
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:19,604
This is...

48
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:21,504
in a box?

49
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:25,505
But why would I be in a place like this?

50
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:31,705
My cell phone!

51
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:34,304
There it is!

52
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:36,805
It's by my feet, my cell phone.

53
00:04:38,505 --> 00:04:40,605
Just a bit more.

54
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:45,504
Conan's not answering.

55
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:47,604
His phone won't connect either.

56
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:51,605
Maybe he went to eat something on his own?

57
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:54,404
I'm hungry.

58
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:56,704
Conan's not like you, Genta.

59
00:04:56,705 --> 00:04:59,904
But the sale's already begun.

60
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:01,505
What shall we do?

61
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:07,105
Don't hang up. Don't hang up, guys.

62
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:10,004
Darn!

63
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,004
Just what do you mean?

64
00:05:12,005 --> 00:05:14,104
You say you know who the perp is,

65
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,804
but you don't want to notify the police?

66
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:21,604
That's because we want to avoid a scandal no matter what.

67
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:24,004
For the sake of the late chairman too.

68
00:05:24,005 --> 00:05:25,704
The late chairman?

69
00:05:25,705 --> 00:05:31,204
You're referring to the leader of the Karahashi group

70
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,404
that you serve as a legal advisor for, Mr. Gotaro Karahashi?

71
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:37,204
Didn't he die of an illness three days ago?

72
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:40,504
Yes. So after the funeral today,

73
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:47,204
we were supposed to publicize the contents of the will.

74
00:05:47,205 --> 00:05:49,504
And, that was stolen.

75
00:05:49,505 --> 00:05:51,704
Which means that

76
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:55,705
something that didn't favor the perp was written there?

77
00:05:57,005 --> 00:05:59,204
It was 10 days before he died.

78
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:00,404
I was called by the chairman

79
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:02,804
to come to the hospital where he was hospitalized.

80
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:05,504
He said that he wanted to re-write the will.

81
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:07,604
I see.

82
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:10,004
I got the new game!

83
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,904
I wonder if Conan's not here yet.

84
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,304
I feel sorry for him if he can't buy the game.

85
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:16,204
-Yeah. -Don't worry,

86
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:19,005
because there were still a lot stacked up.

87
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:22,804
I can't take it anymore. This is it!

88
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:25,004
I'm going to get something to eat!

89
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:28,004
That's right. It's them.

90
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:31,904
I went out with them this morning.

91
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:34,105
Try to remember from the start.

92
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:37,204
Good morning, Conan!

93
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:38,404
Good morning.

94
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:40,604
This morning we met each other

95
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:43,605
to go buy a new game software.

96
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,605
On the way there, I...

97
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:53,304
And what was written in the will before?

98
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:56,704
Since his wife died 10 years ago...

99
00:06:56,705 --> 00:06:57,904
"Karahashi group"

100
00:06:57,905 --> 00:06:59,204
His oldest son,

101
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:03,204
"Kozo" -Kozo Karahashi was to receive 50% of his assets.

102
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:05,104
The remaining assets were to be divided between

103
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:07,004
"Mitsuyo" -his oldest daughter Mitsuyo

104
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:09,804
"Eisuke" -and his second son Eisuke.

105
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,704
And how was he planning to change it?

106
00:07:11,705 --> 00:07:13,204
The thing is,

107
00:07:13,205 --> 00:07:17,304
the chairman had a secretary who served him for 50 years.

108
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:20,704
He wanted to give his entire inheritance over to her.

109
00:07:20,705 --> 00:07:25,504
So probably that woman must be...

110
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:26,804
Yes.

111
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:30,204
She was also privately intimate with the chairman.

112
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:32,104
As they usually say...

113
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:35,304
She was his lover?

114
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:38,204
Yes. Well...

115
00:07:38,205 --> 00:07:40,704
she's fallen ill

116
00:07:40,705 --> 00:07:44,304
and is resting in a hospital in her hometown now.

117
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:46,304
I see.

118
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:50,305
And... Right, I think it was over there.

119
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:56,305
Hurry up, hurry up.

120
00:07:57,805 --> 00:07:59,305
That's...

121
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:02,404
What's the matter, Conan?

122
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:05,104
We'd better hurry or the sale will start.

123
00:08:05,105 --> 00:08:09,304
Let's hurry and buy it so we can eat!

124
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:11,904
You guys go on ahead.

125
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:13,104
Conan?

126
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:14,704
Where are you going?

127
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:16,905
What's with you anyway?

128
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:22,405
I thought so.

129
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:30,204
What? You mean Conan's not here yet?

130
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:31,304
Nope.

131
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:33,104
No.

132
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:37,204
I'm sure he went to eat lunch by himself after all.

133
00:08:37,205 --> 00:08:40,504
There are still two hours to go before lunch.

134
00:08:40,505 --> 00:08:44,404
But really, I wonder what happened to him?

135
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:48,005
I'm worried, so I'll have Ai check on him after all.

136
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:50,504
Edogawa?

137
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:53,905
Okay. I'll try tracking his cell phone GPS.

138
00:08:55,205 --> 00:08:57,404
No signal?

139
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:58,505
If so...

140
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:03,404
Oh, no.

141
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:06,904
The spare glasses are out for a tune-up with Doc.

142
00:09:06,905 --> 00:09:08,804
"Mouri"

143
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:11,704
Yes, Mouri Detective Agency.

144
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:14,204
Oh, Ai?

145
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:17,604
What? Conan? He's not home yet.

146
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,504
Isn't he with you?

147
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:24,004
No, because I'm not interested in the games they have nowadays.

148
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:27,004
Then if Edogawa calls you,

149
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:28,904
please tell him to call me.

150
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:31,204
What? What do you mean?

151
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:33,504
Oh, wait, Ai.

152
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:36,304
Right. That's right.

153
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:37,505
I remember now!

154
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:51,005
"Asada Law Firm"

155
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,104
"Integrity"

156
00:10:08,105 --> 00:10:10,305
A safecracker?

157
00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:55,805
I'm being transported somewhere.

158
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:58,505
Where...

159
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:02,704
What's this smell?

160
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:05,905
Maybe incense?

161
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:12,404
Dry ice?

162
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:17,104
Don't tell me this is inside a coffin.

163
00:11:17,105 --> 00:11:21,105
Was I buried?

164
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:28,043
Ai!

165
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:29,743
You came.

166
00:11:29,744 --> 00:11:32,543
I had no choice since the cell phone didn't connect.

167
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:35,943
But I think we should contact the police too.

168
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:39,943
But all the members of the Detective Squad are here.

169
00:11:39,944 --> 00:11:42,943
Why don't we try a search for him ourselves to start?

170
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:48,144
He could've just gone to eat lunch by himself too, that Conan!

171
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:53,043
And where did you all leave him?

172
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:54,544
This way!

173
00:11:58,244 --> 00:12:00,443
Is this draft?

174
00:12:00,444 --> 00:12:03,743
Which means I'm not buried.

175
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:04,844
If so...

176
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:12,244
Somebody! Is anybody around?

177
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:15,543
No good.

178
00:12:15,544 --> 00:12:17,044
Then...

179
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:19,144
It's that!

180
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,544
Just a little bit more.

181
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:29,644
Just a bit more!

182
00:12:30,644 --> 00:12:33,743
I'm sure it was here, Ai.

183
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:34,843
Yes!

184
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:36,943
It was here that Conan suddenly said,

185
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:40,243
"You guys go on ahead."

186
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:44,143
There are no eel or hamburger shops here.

187
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:45,843
You know.

188
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:49,543
Maybe he saw or found something.

189
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:50,843
What?

190
00:12:50,844 --> 00:12:52,443
That's what we're going to look for.

191
00:12:52,444 --> 00:12:54,843
Let's split up. We're going to search

192
00:12:54,844 --> 00:12:57,843
on this side and that side by moving on slowly.

193
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:01,243
The Detective Squad is on the go!

194
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:03,843
-Aye! -Aye!

195
00:13:03,844 --> 00:13:05,844
I'm starved.

196
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:12,243
-Come on, let's go, Genta. -Sorry about that.

197
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:18,244
"Gotaro Karahashi Funeral"

198
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:29,243
"Kozo Karahashi (38)" -Kogoro Mouri?

199
00:13:29,244 --> 00:13:31,743
"Eldest Son of the Karahashi Family" -You mean that famed detective?

200
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,543
Since this is quite a serious matter

201
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:35,743
and we don't have time to spare,

202
00:13:35,744 --> 00:13:39,243
I insisted on him to take the job.

203
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:42,443
So as he introduced me,

204
00:13:42,444 --> 00:13:46,243
I am the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri.

205
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:47,843
Nice to meet you.

206
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:49,143
"Mitsuyo Karahashi (32)" -A detective?

207
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:50,843
"Eldest Daughter of the Karahashi Family" -What is the meaning of this?

208
00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:57,743
It's like you're saying that the perp that stole the will is among us.

209
00:13:57,744 --> 00:13:59,843
"Eisuke Karahashi (28)" -Stop playing dumb.

210
00:13:59,844 --> 00:14:03,043
"Second Son of the Karahashi Family" -Of course,

211
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:05,444
the perp's among us.

212
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:10,143
So, who's the perp?

213
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:13,943
You know who it is already, don't you? Famed detective?

214
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:17,143
No, well...

215
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:19,843
What's that look, Eisuke?

216
00:14:19,844 --> 00:14:21,944
You're the one who's playing dumb, aren't you?

217
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:24,643
What the hell are you talking about?

218
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:25,743
Cut out your attitude!

219
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:28,043
You want to fight? You jerk!

220
00:14:28,044 --> 00:14:30,643
Stop it, both of you!

221
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:32,844
This is no time for something like this!

222
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:36,143
Talk about stupid.

223
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:40,143
The one who was really upset about the will being re-written

224
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:43,043
was none other than you, right, Kozo?

225
00:14:43,044 --> 00:14:44,243
What?

226
00:14:44,244 --> 00:14:45,843
Mitsuyo, talk for yourself.

227
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,443
I'll bet you were pissed about the original will too.

228
00:14:49,444 --> 00:14:52,043
Because you didn't think your share was good enough.

229
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:53,143
Yes.

230
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:55,344
That goes for Eisuke too.

231
00:14:57,644 --> 00:15:00,343
I wasn't as affected as you guys!

232
00:15:00,344 --> 00:15:02,243
-What? -What?

233
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:03,944
What do you want?

234
00:15:06,144 --> 00:15:08,743
Mr. Mouri...

235
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:10,943
Please calm down, everyone.

236
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:14,044
Your father's funeral will be starting soon.

237
00:15:16,744 --> 00:15:21,443
So, I'll be telling you the details later is what I'd like to say,

238
00:15:21,444 --> 00:15:24,844
but I have one thing I'd like to clarify.

239
00:15:26,044 --> 00:15:29,143
Where were all of you this morning?

240
00:15:29,144 --> 00:15:33,144
And can you back it up?

241
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:36,243
See, he's checking our alibis already!

242
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:37,743
Interesting!

243
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:39,443
I tell you.

244
00:15:39,444 --> 00:15:41,943
You mean you're happy being treated like a criminal?

245
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:44,743
He's always been that way.

246
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:47,544
And, who do you want to start with, famed detective?

247
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:52,543
Let's start with you, the oldest, Kozo.

248
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:53,743
That was your name, correct?

249
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:58,243
Would you tell us where you were this morning?

250
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:01,243
Of course I was home at that time.

251
00:16:01,244 --> 00:16:03,143
That's right!

252
00:16:03,144 --> 00:16:06,643
I was suddenly awakened by his phone call!

253
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:08,443
Really?

254
00:16:08,444 --> 00:16:09,843
If you're a famed detective,

255
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,843
I'm sure you can get the police or telephone company

256
00:16:11,844 --> 00:16:13,243
to verify it for you.

257
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:17,843
It's for sure that I got a call from him early this morning.

258
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,243
At home?

259
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,943
Not on your cell phone?

260
00:16:20,944 --> 00:16:26,143
Yeah. Only, I don't know where he called from though.

261
00:16:26,144 --> 00:16:28,643
I called from my home,

262
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:31,643
after the call from big sis woke me up.

263
00:16:31,644 --> 00:16:34,943
I see. You called from home phone too?

264
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:39,143
Only, I don't know where she called me from.

265
00:16:39,144 --> 00:16:42,843
She complained about not liking the way the funeral was being organized.

266
00:16:42,844 --> 00:16:45,243
I couldn't take it, so I called Kozo.

267
00:16:45,244 --> 00:16:48,144
But big sis came in on catch phone while we were talking.

268
00:16:49,244 --> 00:16:50,443
Just because you're the oldest,

269
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,443
you organized all of the funeral on your own,

270
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,643
but I figured that

271
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:56,043
Dad wouldn't be able to rest in peace the way you went about it!

272
00:16:56,044 --> 00:16:57,743
What?

273
00:16:57,744 --> 00:17:00,343
And, I'll tell you before you even ask me,

274
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:02,643
but I called from the home phone too.

275
00:17:02,644 --> 00:17:04,343
You too?

276
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:07,643
I only use my cell phone when I'm not at home.

277
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:11,043
Why don't you check on it, Mr. Famed Detective?

278
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:12,944
Is that right?

279
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,643
That's right,

280
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:18,843
if there's a nail or something sticking out,

281
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:21,643
I can hook the rope on and cut the rope.

282
00:17:21,644 --> 00:17:24,944
Darn. I can't see too well.

283
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:33,144
That's it!

284
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:40,943
Okay, over here.

285
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:42,644
Come over this way.

286
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:47,643
Looking at how confident they are...

287
00:17:47,644 --> 00:17:49,843
What do you think, Mr. Mouri?

288
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:54,643
Yes, of course I'll verify what they said later,

289
00:17:54,644 --> 00:17:56,043
but they probably...

290
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:58,043
Our alibis have been established?

291
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:00,543
I wonder. You never know.

292
00:18:00,544 --> 00:18:01,643
Yeah,

293
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:05,043
because maybe someone was paid to do it.

294
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:06,843
If so, I'm safe!

295
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:08,943
I don't have that kind of money.

296
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:10,943
Unlike you.

297
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:13,743
Oh, really?

298
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:16,743
You can pay after inheriting the money, can't you?

299
00:18:16,744 --> 00:18:18,543
That goes for you too.

300
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:21,943
You guys look suspicious after all.

301
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:23,943
Look who's talking. You seem the most suspicious to me.

302
00:18:23,944 --> 00:18:27,944
-What do you mean? Gosh, this is annoying. -You are a nut.

303
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:37,944
I did it!

304
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:44,143
It's broken.

305
00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:45,244
Then...

306
00:18:59,344 --> 00:19:01,944
How is it? Did you find him?

307
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:06,044
"Eel" -It sure looks good.

308
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:10,044
He's not on this side!

309
00:19:11,544 --> 00:19:14,143
I wonder where Conan is.

310
00:19:14,144 --> 00:19:17,743
Maybe we should report this to the police after all?

311
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:19,144
Wait a sec!

312
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,644
Okay!

313
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:35,443
A car? Which means,

314
00:19:35,444 --> 00:19:37,143
judging from the way the sound is echoing,

315
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:38,543
this is inside a building?

316
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,344
No, it could be the basement parking lot!

317
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:47,244
Wait a sec!

318
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:52,544
Wait!

319
00:19:58,144 --> 00:20:01,943
Wait, don't go!

320
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:03,543
Wait!

321
00:20:03,544 --> 00:20:05,844
Hey!

322
00:20:08,044 --> 00:20:12,443
No good. Darn!

323
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,143
Repairing the lock?

324
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:16,043
It seems that the resident of the building

325
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:17,843
called him early this morning.

326
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:20,243
Is that what Conan saw?

327
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:24,043
Maybe there's a really delicious diner inside or something.

328
00:20:24,044 --> 00:20:25,743
I mean, I guess not.

329
00:20:25,744 --> 00:20:27,843
I wonder if it was a thief.

330
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:31,543
I don't think he was informed of anything like that,

331
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:33,044
but it's possible.

332
00:20:34,844 --> 00:20:36,744
Maybe we should contact the police.

333
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:45,543
Ai?

334
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,143
Oh, Dad.

335
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:50,243
What? A funeral?

336
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:51,543
From now?

337
00:20:51,544 --> 00:20:53,343
-Conan? -Conan?

338
00:20:53,344 --> 00:20:54,544
Where on earth are you?

339
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:57,043
Stop shouting.

340
00:20:57,044 --> 00:21:00,643
I don't know either, where this is?

341
00:21:00,644 --> 00:21:03,344
I don't seem to be buried, but...

342
00:21:04,544 --> 00:21:05,944
What do you mean?

343
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:12,243
From the size, I think I'm in a coffin.

344
00:21:12,244 --> 00:21:15,043
A wooden board's been placed on a stack of folded cardboard boxes,

345
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:16,944
to create a double bottom.

346
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:21,244
I'm in the lower bottom space.

347
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:25,743
Which means that...

348
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,044
somebody's body is right above me?

349
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,143
What's this?

350
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:33,144
What?

351
00:21:40,444 --> 00:21:41,844
Darn.

352
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:44,743
No good.

353
00:21:44,744 --> 00:21:46,543
And where are you guys now?

354
00:21:46,544 --> 00:21:49,743
We followed your tracks

355
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:51,243
and are now at the backdoor of the building.

356
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:53,143
Yeah, yeah!

357
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:55,744
There was a burglary in this building and...

358
00:22:05,144 --> 00:22:06,944
It... it's moving?

359
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,543
Which means I'm in a car.

360
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:15,443
A car with a coffin in it?

361
00:22:15,444 --> 00:22:17,143
Don't tell me...

362
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:19,244
that this is a hearse?

363
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:45,143
"Next Episode" -I'm in a double bottom coffin

364
00:23:45,144 --> 00:23:47,243
and above me...

365
00:23:47,244 --> 00:23:48,744
is someone else's corpse.

366
00:23:50,444 --> 00:23:51,943
Where's Conan?

367
00:23:51,944 --> 00:23:54,343
-We found him! -Really?

368
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:57,143
He's in a hearse now!

369
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,143
A hearse?

370
00:23:59,144 --> 00:24:01,143
What?

371
00:24:01,144 --> 00:24:03,943
Conan is in a coffin?

372
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:06,643
The will is in there too?

373
00:24:06,644 --> 00:24:08,043
Next Conan,

374
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:12,044
