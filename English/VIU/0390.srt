1
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:22,851
The love story of two police officers.

2
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:24,151
The Youth Detective Squad plays a part.

3
00:00:24,152 --> 00:00:25,851
And the case takes a surprising turn!

4
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:27,451
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,452 --> 00:00:29,251
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,252 --> 00:00:31,352
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:02,268
Sorry...

8
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:04,168
Officer Sato?

9
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:06,168
What is it you want to talk to me about?

10
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,669
What do I do?

11
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:15,234
Officer Takagi, just get inside!

12
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,735
Oh, okay!

13
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:20,334
What it is? What in the world is it?

14
00:02:20,335 --> 00:02:23,034
I wonder if I did something wrong again?

15
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:25,234
Officer Sato's birthday is in April.

16
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:28,035
I kept her company at karaoke too.

17
00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:31,534
Don't tell me that...

18
00:02:31,535 --> 00:02:33,234
She's going to ask me to break up with her?

19
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:34,634
Wait...

20
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:35,735
No way.

21
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:41,635
What?

22
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:47,634
I got you! You fell for it.

23
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:48,835
What?

24
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:57,634
How'd you like it?

25
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,434
Just great, isn't it, Officer Takagi?

26
00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:00,835
This toy!

27
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:07,235
I'm going to try it on Officer Yumi next!

28
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:11,034
Officer Sato!

29
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:14,734
Don't tell me you brought me all the way here just to try that on me?

30
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:16,134
Exactly.

31
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:17,634
Is there anything wrong?

32
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:20,335
We're finished work and ready to go home anyway.

33
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,934
Come on.

34
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:26,634
Or are you saying that

35
00:03:26,635 --> 00:03:30,034
I can't ask you to come with me unless I have something important to do?

36
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:32,035
Police Sergeant Takagi?

37
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:35,235
No.

38
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:37,634
They sure are in love.

39
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,534
No. They're no way close to being in love yet...

40
00:03:39,535 --> 00:03:41,634
Well... They're probably going to make it soon.

41
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:43,235
No! Not for sometime yet.

42
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:47,035
Stop it, will you, Officer Sato?

43
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:54,735
"Love Story at Police Headquarters 6 (Part 1)"

44
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,934
Request for dispatch from the Tottori Prefectural Police?

45
00:03:58,935 --> 00:04:00,035
Yeah.

46
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:03,334
You know of them, don't you, Megure?

47
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:06,434
The band of thieves that started raiding that area

48
00:04:06,435 --> 00:04:08,234
and are now stealing nationwide.

49
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:10,035
Okay. See you.

50
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:16,934
A joint investigation headquarters was set up in Tottori

51
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:20,234
and they're asking for people from the First Investigation Division here.

52
00:04:20,235 --> 00:04:21,734
But, Sergeant!

53
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:23,834
Isn't it supposed to be taken care of by the Third Division?

54
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:25,634
Have you forgotten, Megure?

55
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:28,834
They've also committed attempted murder in Tokyo too.

56
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,334
Oh, that's right.

57
00:04:31,335 --> 00:04:32,934
Of course, they're sending one person from the third division

58
00:04:32,935 --> 00:04:35,034
but they'll also be sending one from the first division.

59
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:37,434
Who would you recommend?

60
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:39,234
Well...

61
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:42,134
Someone who's single, brilliant and has robust enough

62
00:04:42,135 --> 00:04:43,934
to tolerate the hard work in a different prefecture.

63
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:46,735
If that person is familiar with the area it's even better.

64
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:50,834
That's right.

65
00:04:50,835 --> 00:04:54,834
Hey, Megure! Wasn't his hometown somewhere in Tottori?

66
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:56,034
Who?

67
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:59,434
What? Who do you mean?

68
00:04:59,435 --> 00:05:02,134
Him. Takagi! Officer Takagi!

69
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,235
What? Takagi?

70
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:09,235
Oh, no!

71
00:05:11,135 --> 00:05:13,234
I think he's a good candidate, don't you?

72
00:05:13,235 --> 00:05:15,334
Yes, I guess so.

73
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:17,634
Although his appearance doesn't show it,

74
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:20,534
he's pretty sharp and I hear he's solved a lot of cases too.

75
00:05:20,535 --> 00:05:21,934
Okay then, Sergeant.

76
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:25,034
I'll notify him tomorrow morning.

77
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:26,335
Thanks. That'll be a great help.

78
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:34,734
It's sad to think that he's going to go far away.

79
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:38,534
Hide's really going abroad.

80
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:40,634
We still don't know for sure, do we?

81
00:05:40,635 --> 00:05:44,134
England is the place where soccer originated, right?

82
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,135
If you're a fan,

83
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,134
wouldn't you like to see him play at the original location?

84
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:50,134
That's true but...

85
00:05:50,135 --> 00:05:52,034
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

86
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:54,734
I feel that it's a good idea to go abroad and get tough,

87
00:05:54,735 --> 00:05:56,035
more so, for the World Cup.

88
00:05:57,135 --> 00:05:58,534
That's right.

89
00:05:58,535 --> 00:06:00,335
The World Cup.

90
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:04,034
The World Cup?

91
00:06:04,035 --> 00:06:05,334
It seems like it's stopped raining.

92
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:07,234
Oh, true.

93
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:08,635
I see.

94
00:06:18,935 --> 00:06:21,134
That man was heaving hard

95
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:22,734
and he seemed to be having a hard time.

96
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:26,234
Of course! Because he's jogging.

97
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:29,534
Come on, we'd better hurry or we'll be late for school!

98
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:30,535
She's right!

99
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:32,035
Let's go!

100
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:37,534
What?

101
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:40,934
That's what I heard. And...

102
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:42,234
Hey! Are you listening?

103
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,334
Miwako?

104
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:46,534
Oh. Yeah.

105
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:48,534
Oh, no! I'm barely going to make it.

106
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:50,435
Good morning!

107
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:00,634
Sorry...

108
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:02,635
Is there anything on my face?

109
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:09,734
Officer Yumi?

110
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:11,334
Officer Takagi.

111
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:13,635
Yes?

112
00:07:19,935 --> 00:07:22,435
Goodbye...

113
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,034
Wait...

114
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:26,535
Just what do you mean?

115
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:33,934
What?

116
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:36,134
I'm going to be dispatched

117
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:38,334
to the joint investigation headquarters in Tottori?

118
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:40,034
Maybe you got the wrong person.

119
00:07:40,035 --> 00:07:44,334
Stupid! You're the only Takagi here!

120
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:45,834
Don't play dumb!

121
00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:49,834
According to Yumi, you should've gotten a call from Inspector Megure.

122
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:51,834
What? Come to think of it,

123
00:07:51,835 --> 00:07:54,334
I did get a call from the inspector this morning.

124
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:58,034
I was still drowsy, so I didn't really follow what he was saying.

125
00:07:58,035 --> 00:08:00,434
See. It's that phone call.

126
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:01,834
What?

127
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:06,134
But I get to come back after the case is solved anyway so...

128
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:08,834
You don't understand anything, do you?

129
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:10,334
The headquarters is pursuing the robbers

130
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:13,034
that are committing the serial robberies nationwide, you know?

131
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:16,634
In most cases like these, who knows how many incidents there are.

132
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:18,734
And besides, if there are several members involved,

133
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:21,234
who knows when the case'll be solved.

134
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:23,334
Well, things'll work out.

135
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:26,134
With his ability...

136
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:28,834
Three years will probably enough to solve the case.

137
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:30,634
Three years...

138
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,735
Three years?

139
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:40,735
Three years. 1,095 days. 26,280 hours.

140
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:44,834
The Heavens have not forsaken me.

141
00:08:44,835 --> 00:08:46,534
I'm happy for you!

142
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:48,134
The air is clean in Tottori

143
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:50,334
and you can eat all you want of Matsuba crab!

144
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:52,634
You can ride camels at the sand dunes of Tottori too!

145
00:08:52,635 --> 00:08:55,834
-No, I will not! -Officer Takagi.

146
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,135
Officer Sato.

147
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,334
Don't forget to send me 20th Century Japanese Pears, okay?

148
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:07,035
They're my favorite.

149
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:09,234
What?

150
00:09:09,235 --> 00:09:11,034
That's the word!

151
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:12,634
That's my favorite.

152
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,834
Matsuba Crab is our favorite.

153
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:17,034
Don't forget the camels while you're at it, okay?

154
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:19,435
What's with all this noise?

155
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:22,035
We've got a case!

156
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:23,134
The scene of the crime is

157
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:26,934
on the third floor of a skyscraper located on Beikacho Yonchome!

158
00:09:26,935 --> 00:09:28,934
A man was found stabbed to death.

159
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,234
According to report by investigators,

160
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:32,535
the one who found the corpse seems to be a woman.

161
00:09:33,735 --> 00:09:36,234
Sato and Takagi, go to the scene of the crime on the double!

162
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:37,235
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

163
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:40,334
And Megure you take care of giving orders at the scene.

164
00:09:40,335 --> 00:09:41,534
Oh, no, well...

165
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:45,934
Please have Mr. Chosuke take care of things this time, Sergeant!

166
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:47,034
Mr. Chosuke!

167
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:48,135
Okay.

168
00:09:49,635 --> 00:09:51,434
On the double!

169
00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:52,435
Yes, sir!

170
00:09:52,436 --> 00:09:54,634
Officer Chosuke!

171
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:58,134
This is the first time I'm teaming with you, isn't it, Officer Chosuke?

172
00:09:58,135 --> 00:10:00,034
Yeah, let's get to work.

173
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:01,035
Officer Takagi.

174
00:10:01,036 --> 00:10:02,434
Yes, sir!

175
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,834
Mr. Chosuke is a veteran that's two years older than me.

176
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:08,134
Learn a lot from him, will you?

177
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:09,934
Yes, sir! Of course!

178
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:11,234
And...

179
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,334
This may be the last time he'll be teaming with you.

180
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:15,435
What?

181
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,635
Officer Takagi. Goodbye!

182
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:24,835
Are you serious?

183
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:32,693
Hide's press conference was from noon, right?

184
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:34,193
Oh, no!

185
00:10:34,194 --> 00:10:36,393
We'd better hurry or we'll miss it!

186
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:37,793
We'll make it!

187
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:40,593
Hide's press conference will be the top news of today!

188
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:43,393
It'll probably be aired several times all night.

189
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:45,994
Something seems to have happened.

190
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:48,394
Yeah.

191
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:52,093
The name of the man that was stabbed is Mr. Hirotoshi Nakamoto,

192
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:54,293
age 27, an office worker.

193
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:57,593
The murder weapon is an 18 cm knife.

194
00:10:57,594 --> 00:10:59,193
The estimated time of death is

195
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:02,393
between 7 am to 7:30 am today.

196
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:09,293
You, his colleague at work, came here at 1 pm and found him dead.

197
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,294
Yes, sir.

198
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,793
I took a day off from work today

199
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:16,393
and was supposed to go with him to reserve our wedding hall.

200
00:11:16,394 --> 00:11:18,993
How could something like this happen?

201
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:20,393
And...

202
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:23,693
Do you know of anyone who may have had a grudge against him?

203
00:11:23,694 --> 00:11:27,193
"Yui Shimura" -He was the type to make enemies.

204
00:11:27,194 --> 00:11:29,693
It seems the killer is an acquaintance of his.

205
00:11:29,694 --> 00:11:32,293
Yes, the door was locked.

206
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:35,193
Then, will you pick out the person that you think

207
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,993
may have had a grudge against him from the album?

208
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:39,294
I'll go check the person out.

209
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:43,293
Can you see something?

210
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:46,093
It's Officer Takagi and Officer Sato!

211
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:47,893
So take care of it, okay?

212
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:49,693
Yes.

213
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:51,393
Did something happen?

214
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:53,393
I'll bet it's a homicide case?

215
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:55,393
Yeah, well...

216
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:59,993
Didn't it happen around a little after 7 am this morning?

217
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:02,093
Officer Sato.

218
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:03,693
How do you know about it?

219
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:07,293
We saw a suspicious looking person on our way to school.

220
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,393
On the street near this condominium!

221
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:11,493
Come on, Conan!

222
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:14,093
That man was just jogging and...

223
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:16,593
Remember! Just before we passed that man,

224
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:18,693
it stopped raining, right?

225
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:22,293
Yes. It was a rain shower that lasted about 10 minutes.

226
00:12:22,294 --> 00:12:25,993
But that guy's clothes was hardly wet at all.

227
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:27,593
Why do you think it wasn't wet?

228
00:12:27,594 --> 00:12:30,493
Maybe he was taking shelter from the rain somewhere?

229
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:33,193
Because it started raining while he was jogging.

230
00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:36,693
And he started running again because it stopped raining!

231
00:12:36,694 --> 00:12:40,893
Idiot! If he rested 10 minutes, he wouldn't be heaving like that!

232
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:45,093
In other words, he wasn't out of breath because he was jogging.

233
00:12:45,094 --> 00:12:51,093
But because he was hyper from having stabbed someone in a room near here.

234
00:12:51,094 --> 00:12:53,994
That's what you wanted to say, right, Sonny?

235
00:12:57,394 --> 00:12:59,993
Is that man here?

236
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:00,994
What?

237
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:02,693
I think...

238
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:04,393
This man!

239
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:06,593
This man sort of looks like him!

240
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:10,293
That man... He's Mr. Kato, a colleague of his at work!

241
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:13,193
If I remember correctly, I heard that he was freeloading

242
00:13:13,194 --> 00:13:14,493
at his friend's place.

243
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,893
Do you know where that house is?

244
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:16,994
Oh, yes.

245
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:21,293
What? A little after 7 am this morning?

246
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:24,493
"Akira Kato" -I was here right through.

247
00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:27,993
No! You're the one who stabbed Hirotoshi, aren't you?

248
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:30,593
What? Me? Commit murder?

249
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:32,793
Just what are you talking about? Out of the blue like that.

250
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:34,593
What's going on? Cut out the noise.

251
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:38,393
I told you to get rid of door-to-door sales, didn't I?

252
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:40,693
Oh, well... The thing is...

253
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,193
So, what's the problem?

254
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:44,293
What?

255
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:46,993
-What? -Officer Chiba?

256
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,194
Yeah.

257
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:53,793
This is interesting.

258
00:13:53,794 --> 00:13:56,793
What? Suspect of a homicide case?

259
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,593
You mean Kato?

260
00:13:58,594 --> 00:14:00,093
Yes, that's right.

261
00:14:00,094 --> 00:14:05,093
His colleague at work, Mr. Hirotoshi Nakamoto, was murdered.

262
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,993
The murder weapon was a knife.

263
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:08,793
It was found on the floor beside the body.

264
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:12,093
And the estimated time of death was?

265
00:14:12,094 --> 00:14:15,593
Between 7 am to 7:30 am this morning.

266
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:19,093
Then, he couldn't have committed the crime.

267
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:21,893
Because he woke me up at 7 am,

268
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:25,593
and we were here together watching TV until 8 pm.

269
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:26,594
Right?

270
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:27,594
Yeah.

271
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:28,693
Is it true?

272
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:33,193
Yes. We were watching Nichiuri TV's live morning broadcast.

273
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:36,293
"Morning Live Seven", a news variety program.

274
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:38,793
But, Officer Chiba, he woke you up, didn't he?

275
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,493
Then it could be that he showed you something that

276
00:14:41,494 --> 00:14:43,793
he had video taped some time ago, right?

277
00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:45,793
No way!

278
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:47,593
I've got proof too.

279
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:50,193
By the way, why am I suspected in the first place?

280
00:14:50,194 --> 00:14:52,794
Because you're my ex-boyfriend!

281
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,893
There's an eye-witness

282
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:58,393
that says he saw you a little past 7 am near the condominium!

283
00:14:58,394 --> 00:15:02,093
Are you sure that guy wasn't half asleep and mistook me for someone else?

284
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:04,493
We weren't half asleep!

285
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:06,393
I saw it clearly!

286
00:15:06,394 --> 00:15:07,694
It was him!

287
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:10,793
He was wearing a gray parka top.

288
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:13,493
You were running with a black knapsack on your back!

289
00:15:13,494 --> 00:15:16,694
Just as if you were jogging.

290
00:15:17,894 --> 00:15:20,793
Let's have Officer Chiba show us in!

291
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,393
And show us proof that he was watching TV with that man

292
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:25,994
from 7 am to 8 am in the morning.

293
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,693
Wait... What's this?

294
00:15:30,694 --> 00:15:32,893
What a mess!

295
00:15:32,894 --> 00:15:36,093
I can see why you're always late for work.

296
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:38,493
I'm doing the best I can!

297
00:15:38,494 --> 00:15:41,293
I'm recently not as tardy as I used to be, right?

298
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:43,393
Come to think of it, that's true.

299
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:44,593
How come?

300
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:47,593
Oh, well, I sort of did something to give me initiative to get up.

301
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:50,193
What's with these toys here?

302
00:15:50,194 --> 00:15:52,493
Don't tell me that you're some special effects freak or something?

303
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,293
Who cares?

304
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:55,794
I mean after all, it's just a hobby.

305
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:00,593
It's Gomera! Gomera!

306
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:02,393
Masked Yaiba is here too!

307
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:07,293
-That's a rare object made of tin! -Hey! Don't get rough with them.

308
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:08,593
I told you all to wait in the car

309
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:12,793
with Mr. Kato and Ms. Shimura, didn't I?

310
00:16:12,794 --> 00:16:14,393
And, where is it?

311
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:18,793
The proof you mentioned that both of you were watching TV together.

312
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:21,594
Oh, yes, sir! It's this video tape.

313
00:16:24,394 --> 00:16:27,893
Hi! This is "Yoko Okino's Four-minute Cooking"!

314
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:30,293
It's February 25th, Friday.

315
00:16:30,294 --> 00:16:34,793
I video tape this corner of "Morning Live Seven" each time.

316
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:38,293
Last night, I watched rental videos with Kato while drinking

317
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:39,493
and fell asleep here.

318
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:41,193
I forgot to pre-set the program to record it

319
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:42,993
so I recorded it myself today.

320
00:16:42,994 --> 00:16:47,393
That's why he couldn't have shown me something he recorded beforehand.

321
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:50,693
Besides that, there is only one video tape deck is being used.

322
00:16:50,694 --> 00:16:53,493
But, there's another deck here.

323
00:16:53,494 --> 00:16:56,893
That's one that we only use sometimes for dubbing!

324
00:16:56,894 --> 00:16:58,293
If he used that deck,

325
00:16:58,294 --> 00:17:00,393
the cord would show in front of the TV,

326
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,093
and I would notice it no matter how drowsy I may be.

327
00:17:03,094 --> 00:17:06,994
If you think it's a lie, call the TV station and confirm it!

328
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:13,093
It's the corner after Nichiruri TV's "Morning Live Seven"'s

329
00:17:13,094 --> 00:17:15,793
weather forecast of today, February 25th, Friday.

330
00:17:15,794 --> 00:17:19,393
Gosh. You have many marks in other places too.

331
00:17:19,394 --> 00:17:21,193
Even the cable TV programs are marked.

332
00:17:21,194 --> 00:17:23,593
There are so many programs I want to watch.

333
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:24,893
I see.

334
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:28,893
That's why you've got so many memo pads stuck all over the TV.

335
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:33,893
And? After watching the program until 8 pm, what did you do?

336
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:36,093
I watched videos from 8 pm.

337
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:37,793
What video?

338
00:17:37,794 --> 00:17:40,194
Oh, well... That's...

339
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,593
Chiba! Hey!

340
00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:45,693
Don't tell me?

341
00:17:45,694 --> 00:17:47,093
X-rated videos?

342
00:17:47,094 --> 00:17:49,593
What? No!

343
00:17:49,594 --> 00:17:51,293
"Masked Yaiba" -It's this video...

344
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:52,394
This.

345
00:18:02,694 --> 00:18:05,093
"Masked Yaiba."

346
00:18:05,094 --> 00:18:07,093
-It's "Masked Yaiba"! -It's "Masked Yaiba"!

347
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:08,594
Amazing!

348
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,994
Yaiba kick!

349
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:25,293
This is first episode of the first Yaiba!

350
00:18:25,294 --> 00:18:27,293
The mask of the first Yaiba was really gross

351
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:29,493
but that was one of the good points!

352
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:33,793
And how long were you watching this children's program?

353
00:18:33,794 --> 00:18:36,193
I watched one 120 minute tape.

354
00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:38,793
You mean you watched it for two hours?

355
00:18:38,794 --> 00:18:40,593
No, it's taped on triple the regular speed

356
00:18:40,594 --> 00:18:42,393
and the commercials aren't cut so...

357
00:18:42,394 --> 00:18:44,494
-Six hours? -Six hours?

358
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:48,993
Did you video tape all the tapes, Officer Chiba?

359
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:52,793
No, Kato gave me the ones he taped before.

360
00:18:52,794 --> 00:18:55,693
And were you with him right through?

361
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:59,793
No, after watching half the program I went to take a shower,

362
00:18:59,794 --> 00:19:01,693
for about 30 minutes.

363
00:19:01,694 --> 00:19:03,793
Then, I started watching again.

364
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:06,693
I watched all the way to episode 12 and stopped the video.

365
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:08,893
Then professional baseball was being aired so.

366
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:12,793
You know, the game from 2 pm the Falcons versus the Jaguars!

367
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:14,193
Officer Chosuke and the others came along

368
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,593
while I was watching that game.

369
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:18,393
I see.

370
00:19:18,394 --> 00:19:20,693
From here to the victim's condominium,

371
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:23,293
it would take at least an hour by car.

372
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:24,993
If after watching TV for an hour,

373
00:19:24,994 --> 00:19:27,893
they watched the video for approximately six hours together,

374
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:29,793
his alibi is established.

375
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:33,293
Just to be sure, let's look for the gray parka top

376
00:19:33,294 --> 00:19:36,194
and black knapsack the man had on him.

377
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:51,193
What? Is that for real?

378
00:19:51,194 --> 00:19:52,194
What? What is it?

379
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:53,393
Did you find something?

380
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:54,993
No.

381
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,193
Nothing really.

382
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:59,893
Gosh. If there's nothing, don't shout!

383
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,893
-Sorry. -Sorry.

384
00:20:01,894 --> 00:20:05,093
And how long is the dispatch to Tottori going to be?

385
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:08,493
The guys at the first division says it'll be about three years.

386
00:20:08,494 --> 00:20:11,293
And what did Officer Sato say?

387
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,493
She wants me to get her some 20th Century Japanese Pears.

388
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:16,293
Is that it?

389
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:17,793
That's it.

390
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:19,193
Strange.

391
00:20:19,194 --> 00:20:22,693
It's more natural that she would get more upset.

392
00:20:22,694 --> 00:20:23,893
Well...

393
00:20:23,894 --> 00:20:27,393
although I'll be dispatched, it seems I get to take off once a month,

394
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:28,993
and I can call her frequently too.

395
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,993
I hope you don't end up like Kato.

396
00:20:30,994 --> 00:20:31,994
What?

397
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:36,393
He was abroad on a business trip till last month,

398
00:20:36,394 --> 00:20:37,493
but as soon as he got back,

399
00:20:37,494 --> 00:20:40,693
he called me and asked me to put him up here.

400
00:20:40,694 --> 00:20:42,193
He said that while he was away, the woman he was living with

401
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:43,893
started going out with another man,

402
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:46,493
so he was left without a place to stay.

403
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:48,193
And...

404
00:20:48,194 --> 00:20:50,693
He used to call her everyday, and yet,

405
00:20:50,694 --> 00:20:53,393
he complained he could never understand women.

406
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:54,893
If you're serious about her,

407
00:20:54,894 --> 00:20:57,593
I think you should let her know, don't you?

408
00:20:57,594 --> 00:21:01,293
About how you feel and what your plans are for the future.

409
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:04,993
And, you never know what'll happen to you either, right?

410
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:05,994
Me?

411
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:07,093
Maybe...

412
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:09,993
Maybe end up finding a lover over there!

413
00:21:09,994 --> 00:21:12,293
-What? -That's right.

414
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:15,493
If that happens, he won't be coming home for a while.

415
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:16,593
No way.

416
00:21:16,594 --> 00:21:19,993
Yes. It is said that the hearts of people proportionately pull apart,

417
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:23,293
the more time passes.

418
00:21:23,294 --> 00:21:25,593
Although there rarely seems to be exceptions at times.

419
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:26,594
Hey.

420
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:29,493
I will never go with a woman other than her!

421
00:21:29,494 --> 00:21:31,193
Never!

422
00:21:31,194 --> 00:21:32,793
What do you mean?

423
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:34,793
Just who are we talking about?

424
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,793
Who?

425
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:37,893
What?

426
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:40,293
We were talking about Hide.

427
00:21:40,294 --> 00:21:42,493
Because he may be going abroad.

428
00:21:42,494 --> 00:21:44,493
Oh, Hide.

429
00:21:44,494 --> 00:21:47,893
It seems that Hide decided to remain in Japan.

430
00:21:47,894 --> 00:21:49,293
-What? -Really?

431
00:21:49,294 --> 00:21:51,793
You saw the press conference they had in the afternoon?

432
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:54,793
No, right after "Morning Live Seven" started,

433
00:21:54,794 --> 00:21:57,293
there was a flash news report subtitle displayed on the screen.

434
00:21:57,294 --> 00:21:59,693
It said, "Player Akagi Hideo of the Tokyo Spirits

435
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,293
have announced that he will remain!

436
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:03,993
A press conference will be held at 12 noon."

437
00:22:03,994 --> 00:22:07,693
Did the newscaster mention anything about that news later?

438
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:10,793
No, not in particular.

439
00:22:10,794 --> 00:22:11,993
Wait a second.

440
00:22:11,994 --> 00:22:13,194
Maybe...

441
00:22:16,894 --> 00:22:19,493
I see, so that's the story!

442
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:20,693
But, it's not possible.

443
00:22:20,694 --> 00:22:23,093
Even if this trick were to be used, there are still...

444
00:22:23,094 --> 00:22:25,793
There are still some parts I cannot explain.

445
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:27,593
How was it done?

446
00:22:27,594 --> 00:22:29,494
How was the time rigged?

447
00:23:58,094 --> 00:23:59,993
"Next Episode."

448
00:23:59,994 --> 00:24:02,293
It doesn't seem to be around.

449
00:24:02,294 --> 00:24:03,993
Not here, anyways.

450
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:06,794
Why don't you ask Officer Chiba, then?

451
00:24:08,294 --> 00:24:12,793
Chiba! I'm asking if you swear by this Cherry Blossom crest!

452
00:24:12,794 --> 00:24:16,593
I'll go over there and become a fine police officer!

453
00:24:16,594 --> 00:24:18,093
So, before I go,

454
00:24:18,094 --> 00:24:21,694
please...

455
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:28,094
Next Conan, "Love Story at Police Headquarters 6 (Part 2)"

456
00:24:43,794 --> 00:24:45,593
Next Conan's Hint:

457
00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:48,293
"Clock."

458
00:24:48,294 --> 00:24:49,593
-The next episode... -Will be about...

459
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:50,893
-The two police officers... -Finally...

460
00:24:50,894 --> 00:24:52,094
Breaking up.
