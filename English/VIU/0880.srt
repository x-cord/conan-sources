1
00:00:14,578 --> 00:00:19,178
Yeah. Welcome. I was waiting for you.

2
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:37,877
Thank you.

3
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:41,877
You don't look to be kids who live around here.

4
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:44,177
We came to camp.

5
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:48,477
And when we went to look at the lighthouse, it suddenly began to rain.

6
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:51,677
The roads became like rivers.

7
00:00:51,678 --> 00:00:55,277
The way it's pouring, an umbrella will do you no good.

8
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:57,277
You can stay until the rain lets up

9
00:00:57,278 --> 00:00:59,177
but once it stops, go home.

10
00:00:59,178 --> 00:01:02,277
Staying at this house will do you no good.

11
00:01:02,278 --> 00:01:04,677
No good? What do you mean?

12
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:08,277
Strange things are happening at this house recently.

13
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:10,778
I think it's best you don't get involved.

14
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:13,977
Strange things?

15
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:16,477
I've never seen it

16
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,477
but the master says that a ghost appears.

17
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:22,077
What?

18
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:25,978
Come on. Stop saying things that scare children.

19
00:01:27,678 --> 00:01:29,177
A ghost, they say.

20
00:01:29,178 --> 00:01:32,177
Ghosts are a thing of the past.

21
00:01:32,178 --> 00:01:34,777
It's not that I believe in it either

22
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:39,377
but the master is not someone who lies.

23
00:01:39,378 --> 00:01:45,377
According to him, it seems to be yellowish white.

24
00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:49,178
So, now that you've heard this, give me back the towels.

25
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,877
I'm sure it's a lie.

26
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:57,177
He's just saying that because he wants us to leave as soon as possible.

27
00:01:57,178 --> 00:01:58,478
Yeah.

28
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:01,177
Huh?

29
00:02:01,178 --> 00:02:05,077
Hey. Didn't you just see something yellow?

30
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:07,977
I saw! It vanished right away, though.

31
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:10,878
Don't tell me that it's for real?

32
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:17,177
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

33
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,777
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

34
00:02:19,778 --> 00:02:21,577
What was that we just saw?

35
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:23,677
The smell of a case at an old mansion!

36
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:25,277
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,377
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:30,178
His name is Detective Conan!

39
00:04:10,298 --> 00:04:16,198
"The Youth Detective Squad and the Haunted House"

40
00:04:19,407 --> 00:04:21,307
It's still raining.

41
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:31,706
Huh? You guys are?

42
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:36,006
Sorry to be intruding on you. We're taking shelter from the rain here.

43
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:37,306
I see.

44
00:04:37,307 --> 00:04:40,606
I'm Hideto Amamiya, a free loader here.

45
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:42,207
"Hideto Amamiya (27), Nobuteru's nephew" -Nice to meet you.

46
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,306
Wow!

47
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:46,406
It sort of looks like a science room.

48
00:04:46,407 --> 00:04:49,706
There are a lot of devices here.

49
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,506
I'm a science researcher at the university.

50
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:54,606
I'm not only using this room, but also the annex in the yard

51
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:56,906
as a lab for experiments.

52
00:04:56,907 --> 00:05:00,106
If you're doing such studies, what do you think?

53
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:02,806
About ghosts.

54
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:06,306
Oh. You heard Uncle's story.

55
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:11,206
I don't believe it. But uncle really seems to believe it exists.

56
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:13,606
This house is pretty old, isn't it?

57
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:17,706
Yeah. Uncle bought it 5 years ago when he resigned as president.

58
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:20,506
But, it was made almost 50 years ago.

59
00:05:20,507 --> 00:05:24,006
Did he buy it without knowing of the rumor that a ghost appears?

60
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:25,806
Oh, about that...

61
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:30,606
No, uncle started saying that it appears from only about a half month ago.

62
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:32,406
So, nothing appeared till then?

63
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:36,906
No. The thing is, my aunt passed on two months ago.

64
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:40,806
Uncle says that my aunt is visiting him.

65
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,807
My aunt had bad legs.

66
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:47,106
Aunty!

67
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:49,506
My, Hideto.

68
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:51,906
Are you going out to sketch today too?

69
00:05:51,907 --> 00:05:53,206
Yes.

70
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:56,907
I'm thinking of submitting it in the autumn exhibition.

71
00:06:07,707 --> 00:06:09,007
Aunty!

72
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:13,906
It was where she usual went.

73
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,306
So, we can't understand why she fell over that day.

74
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:19,006
Poor aunty.

75
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:22,106
I'm sure your uncle was shocked too.

76
00:06:22,107 --> 00:06:24,707
That's why he's saying things like he sees a ghost.

77
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:31,306
Thank you. For letting us stay for dinner.

78
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,306
It's still raining so...

79
00:06:33,307 --> 00:06:35,306
Don't worry about it.

80
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:38,106
This stew is super delicious!

81
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:42,106
I see. If you like it, go for second servings, all you like.

82
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:43,506
Another plate for me!

83
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:45,306
You already finished eating?

84
00:06:45,307 --> 00:06:47,806
I'm just making reservations!

85
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,806
I heard that your wife comes to visit you?

86
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:53,706
Oh, that's right.

87
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:56,606
But, your wife died, didn't she?

88
00:06:56,607 --> 00:06:59,806
Yes. But she really comes.

89
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:02,306
She comes after it gets dark

90
00:07:02,307 --> 00:07:05,506
and goes back at around 10pm.

91
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:08,706
How does your wife look?

92
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:13,306
Well, she just looks like a yellowish light.

93
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,007
Then I eventually hear...

94
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:19,207
Chieko's voice.

95
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:25,406
Just around tonight, she'll come and talk about her accident.

96
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:26,507
Huh?

97
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:28,406
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,106
Just what're you doing?

99
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:32,507
I'm truly sorry, sir.

100
00:07:33,507 --> 00:07:36,207
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

101
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:41,306
Okay, it's about time I head back to my room.

102
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:43,206
I'm so very sorry.

103
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:46,206
I guess I'll be getting back to my lab too then.

104
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:47,906
Oh, Hana.

105
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:50,306
I cracked a beaker in my room.

106
00:07:50,307 --> 00:07:52,506
Will you vacuum my room later?

107
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:54,106
Yes, sir.

108
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,907
It's in front of the drug cabinet.

109
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:00,107
Okay.

110
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:08,406
I wonder if he's talking to his wife's ghost now.

111
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:11,606
Somebody may be deceiving him.

112
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:15,206
But, he looked happy to be able to meet the ghost.

113
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:16,906
What shall we do?

114
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:19,106
-About what? -What do you mean about what?

115
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:21,206
If he's being deceived by someone,

116
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:25,406
we, the Youth Detective Squad can't overlook it.

117
00:08:25,407 --> 00:08:28,906
But, you know. Mr. Ohtaguro is happy about it.

118
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:30,406
And we're not even sure if he's really being deceived.

119
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:32,706
Just what do you think you're saying?

120
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:34,906
You know very well that incidents of older people

121
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:36,706
being deceived and taken advantage of

122
00:08:36,707 --> 00:08:39,006
is going around endlessly these days, don't you?

123
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:40,807
Okay.

124
00:08:43,707 --> 00:08:47,807
Don't worry because there's no such thing as ghosts.

125
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,106
Hey, did you see that just now?

126
00:08:55,107 --> 00:08:58,506
Yep. It moved on its own.

127
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:01,807
At any rate. Let's go upstairs.

128
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:10,806
Hi, Chieko.

129
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:13,306
It's Mr. Ohtaguro's voice.

130
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:15,506
So, you've come again tonight too.

131
00:09:15,507 --> 00:09:17,306
Yes, I've come.

132
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,207
It's a woman's voice!

133
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:24,307
Nobody touched the door, but it opened.

134
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:31,407
I'm getting by somehow.

135
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,206
She really appeared!

136
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:39,406
The wheelchair moved on its own!

137
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:41,606
I heard the voice of a woman!

138
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:45,506
We didn't touch the door and yet it opened on its own!

139
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:47,606
In other words, what are you saying?

140
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:50,106
His wife's ghost appeared!

141
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:51,806
Huh?

142
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:56,506
We also saw the light. It was a yellowish color after all.

143
00:09:56,507 --> 00:10:00,206
So, you're saying that it's exactly as Mr. Ohtaguro says.

144
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:03,406
Enough!

145
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:05,206
They're just children,

146
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:08,107
but I can't believe you're going on about ghosts.

147
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:16,006
And what do you people intend to do?

148
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:17,906
If you're leaving, I'll lend you umbrellas.

149
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:19,606
What shall we do?

150
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:21,907
Don't ask me.

151
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:42,607
"Poison"

152
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:56,706
Don't tell me that ghosts actually appear.

153
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:59,506
Let's go home already.

154
00:10:59,507 --> 00:11:03,006
Mitsuhiko, go borrow umbrellas after all.

155
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:05,606
No! Why me?

156
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:11,006
Hey. Even if the ghost were to be real, it's Mrs. Ohtaguro, right?

157
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:13,506
I don't think she'll do anything bad, no?

158
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,507
Huh?

159
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:19,606
Conan, are you going to go borrow umbrellas?

160
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:21,307
No, just give me a minute.

161
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:51,207
I get the picture.

162
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:05,407
"Poison"

163
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,718
Thank you very much

164
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:18,918
for serving us dinner and giving us juice too.

165
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:21,718
Children shouldn't think about things like that.

166
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:26,418
Besides, here, we always drink tea just about this time.

167
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:29,718
Maybe a hot drink would've been better?

168
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:33,718
Because it's become quite cool recently.

169
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:37,318
We're fine. This juice is delicious.

170
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:40,118
Maybe Genta would've preferred eels over rice.

171
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,318
I guess.

172
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:44,618
I wonder if somebody would make a thing called eels juice.

173
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:46,418
What?

174
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:49,918
By the way, where is the other boy that was wearing glasses?

175
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,918
I thought he was here a minute ago.

176
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,418
Oh, you're right.

177
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:56,618
This is usual for Conan.

178
00:12:56,619 --> 00:13:00,219
Yeah, he's that kind of guy!

179
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,918
This house is big,

180
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,319
so I hope he doesn't get lost.

181
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:12,719
Uncle!

182
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:15,818
Are you all right, Uncle?

183
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:17,918
Saburo, call an ambulance right away!

184
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,019
No need for that.

185
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:23,518
-You! -Conan!

186
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,218
Well, give me a break.

187
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:29,018
Hana, what's with this tea?

188
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:32,618
Uncle. Are you okay?

189
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:35,118
It's not surprising that it tastes bad.

190
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:37,818
Because there's salt in that tea.

191
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:39,218
Salt?

192
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,718
Why?

193
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:45,218
I switched the contents in the bottle with the poison

194
00:13:45,219 --> 00:13:48,018
that was in your room, Hideto, to salt.

195
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:50,318
I saw Hana take the bottle with the poison in it from the shelf

196
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:53,019
and found the bottle that she had hidden in the kitchen.

197
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:55,718
Poison?

198
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:57,618
She took the poison with her?

199
00:13:57,619 --> 00:14:01,518
Was she going to put the poison inside the tea then?

200
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,318
Hana was worried that the ghost would expose the truth about

201
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:09,618
Mrs. Ohtaguro's accident that happened 2 months ago.

202
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:11,819
The truth about the accident?

203
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:20,118
I... I...

204
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:22,918
I didn't think that she would die!

205
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:26,619
I just wanted to scare her a bit!

206
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:31,118
Hana, I won't tell you to return

207
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:34,918
the necklaces and broches that you took up to now.

208
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:38,919
But please don't steal anymore.

209
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,719
Somebody!

210
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:54,718
I figured if I tampered with the brakes of her wheelchair,

211
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,718
she would have trouble getting on and off from it. I felt good about it.

212
00:14:57,719 --> 00:15:01,019
That's all I thought!

213
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:04,618
Hana thought that Mrs. Ohtaguro's ghost

214
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:08,118
might tell Mr. Ohtaguro about this.

215
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:11,818
But, you can't do anything about a ghost.

216
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:16,218
That's why Mr. Ohtaguro became Hana's target.

217
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:18,818
The salt that I had switched with the poison,

218
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:22,518
being poured into the tea is evidence.

219
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:25,419
You! What a thing to do?

220
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:31,219
I'm very sorry, sir.

221
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,019
But, you didn't have to worry about it.

222
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:42,018
Because there're no such things as ghosts.

223
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:44,019
Right, Hideto?

224
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:49,518
But, the wheelchair moved on its own, you know?

225
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,118
This house was made 50 year ago,

226
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,819
so it's no surprise that it's worn out here and there.

227
00:15:56,719 --> 00:16:00,818
The wind that blew out from the space in the wall

228
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:03,018
pushed the wheelchair along.

229
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:05,318
The brakes were broken besides.

230
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:10,018
But, the door of the man's room opened on its own.

231
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,518
That door is old and the latch is weak

232
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,418
so the slightest shake will open the door.

233
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:20,318
Then what about the yellow ghost that was floating in that room?

234
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:24,718
Do you remember when we got here?

235
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:27,018
There's a greenhouse.

236
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,618
Gee. It's not serving as shelter from the rain at all.

237
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:30,818
Hey.

238
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:33,919
I wonder if we can get inside from there?

239
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:36,518
Hey, you guys!

240
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,218
Don't fool around now!

241
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:42,018
We just built that greenhouse half a month ago.

242
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:45,418
That greenhouse was built half a month ago.

243
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:48,818
The ghost started appearing half month ago too.

244
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:52,818
By the way, is there anything around here that glows?

245
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:54,118
Something that glows?

246
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:56,218
You mean the lighthouse?

247
00:16:56,219 --> 00:17:00,618
Yes, the identity of the ghost is the light of the lighthouse.

248
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:04,718
The light never used to shine directly on the house until now.

249
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,318
But, since the greenhouse was built,

250
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,818
and light directly reflected on the window glass,

251
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,218
it started to shine on the walls of this house.

252
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:15,718
The light that seeped in from the space in the wall

253
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:18,518
reflected on the glass of Mr. Ohtaguro's bookshelf

254
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:21,018
and created what looked to be a ghost.

255
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,818
I called the owner of the greenhouse a while ago

256
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,018
and was told that he closes the glass door at 10pm.

257
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:30,618
So that's why the ghost disappears at 10pm.

258
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:32,918
He also added that even on rainy days like this,

259
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:36,818
he keeps the windows open to keep the inside moisture free.

260
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:41,618
Then when we came, why did the 2nd floor wall flash with light?

261
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:44,818
Right after that Hideto came, remember?

262
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:48,318
That was probably the lights from his car.

263
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,518
We didn't hear the sound of the car because of the rain.

264
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,618
But I heard the voice of a woman from inside the room.

265
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:58,718
Right, right, the poison that I switched with the salt,

266
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:00,118
I put it in another bottle

267
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,818
and returned it to the shelf where it originally was.

268
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:07,319
Because the cabinet wasn't locked.

269
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,118
If Hana unlocked the cabinet,

270
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:12,918
she would've locked it to make sure nobody would notice.

271
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:17,518
So I think the cabinet was unlocked to begin with.

272
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,618
But despite the poison being inside the cabinet, why leave it unlocked?

273
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:25,618
It's strange for a professional like you to do something like that.

274
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:28,919
You're right. I was careless.

275
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,218
And back to the voice.

276
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:34,918
The ghost is the light of the lighthouse.

277
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,618
So, there must be a reason behind the voice too.

278
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:42,218
I thought so, so I checked Mr. Ohtaguro's room a while ago

279
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:43,619
and I found it.

280
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,118
Behind the bookshelf,

281
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,219
there was a speaker, a microphone and a wireless unit.

282
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,518
It's most likely that Mrs. Ohtaguro's voice was playing from here.

283
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:59,719
The one that can make things like these in this house is...

284
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:05,218
you, Hideto, right?

285
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:08,218
But, even if he did play the voice...

286
00:19:08,219 --> 00:19:10,718
Does it mean that he used the voice of Mrs. Ohtaguro

287
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,218
that was recorded beforehand?

288
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,818
Hideto probably processed and changed his voice

289
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:18,118
to sound like a female's and played it.

290
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,118
Since Mr. Ohtaguro believed that the ghost of his wife was visiting,

291
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,118
Hideto probably assumed that Mr. Ohtaguro would think it was her.

292
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,918
Hideto, who ran over to the site of the accident,

293
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,518
realized that both brakes of the wheelchair were loose.

294
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:37,518
And from the way that Hana acted since Mrs. Ohtaguro passed away,

295
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,118
Hideto realized the connection between the accident and Hana.

296
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,818
So, he figured that if he cornered Hana even more,

297
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:47,918
Hana would act the way he was expecting her to act.

298
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,918
He acted out the voice of the ghost because he wanted her

299
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:53,918
to think that the ghost would speak the truth of the accident.

300
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,818
He then deliberately dropped his beaker

301
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,918
in front of the cabinet that wasn't locked, and asked her to clean it,

302
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,718
knowing what Hana would do.

303
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,518
Everything went as he planned!

304
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,718
Hana took the drug and tried to poison Mr. Ohtaguro!

305
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:14,118
Are you saying that I was after my Uncle's life?

306
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,118
Why would you say something like that?

307
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,718
The reason is this.

308
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:20,718
I brought this from the wastebasket in the room!

309
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,619
This is called a dunning letter, right?

310
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:28,518
It seems you've borrowed money here and there.

311
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,618
Your motive is money.

312
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:33,118
Since you had a lot of debts, Hideto,

313
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,419
you wanted Mr. Ohtaguro's assets.

314
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,418
Hey, then why didn't you talk straightforwardly

315
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,919
and honestly about it to Mr. Ohtaguro?

316
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:52,118
Uncle is super strict when it comes to these things.

317
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:57,518
Hideto. Then, what this boy is saying is true?

318
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:58,918
Yes.

319
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,219
Please call the police.

320
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,118
The moon!

321
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,818
The rain has let up.

322
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:54,018
We just went to take shelter from the rain

323
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:56,518
but it turned out to be some night.

324
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:59,318
I'm sort of hungry.

325
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,519
Huh? Genta, not again.

326
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:15,919
Sir!

327
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:21,918
Will you keep that glass open a while longer just today?

328
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,019
Huh?

329
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:25,319
Please!

330
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:30,818
Conan, what are you doing?

331
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:32,318
Nothing.

332
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,018
Let's go home because Doc and Haibara are probably worrying about us!

333
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:38,318
Let's have Doc come pick us up.

334
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,219
Good idea.

335
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:45,018
How do you do?

336
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:49,219
Long time no see, Shuichi.

337
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:55,718
Is that joke popular in Britain?

338
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:59,818
Just like a child who is caught under the spell of Death.

339
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:01,018
How about it?

340
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:04,118
Can you do it, little Sherlock Holmes?

341
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:06,419
Yep! Of course!

342
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:12,419
Next Conan, "The Magician of the Waves (Part 1)"
