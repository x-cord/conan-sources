1
00:00:01,508 --> 00:00:03,208
The start of the age of mystery.

2
00:00:03,208 --> 00:00:05,308
The detective show on Monday at 7.

3
00:00:05,308 --> 00:00:06,908
The treasure hunt became a big case.

4
00:00:06,908 --> 00:00:09,708
What will happen to the kidnapped Haibara and Mitsuhiko?

5
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,208
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:13,108
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:15,408
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,439
At the Shouin Shrine in Tokyo,

9
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,739
we rescued Kimiko Kobayakawa

10
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,639
from a man attacked her.

11
00:01:57,639 --> 00:02:00,239
In order to search for "The treasure that could buy a country"

12
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,839
that her deceased grandfather was said to possess.

13
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:05,839
We went to Tsuwano, Kimiko's family home.

14
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:09,839
On the way, at Shin-Yamaguchi Station,

15
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:13,139
we ran into Kimiko's friend, Shigeru Kawaguchi.

16
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,639
However, Haibara and I noticed that

17
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,239
he was assuming a false name.

18
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,239
At Tsuwano, we discovered a new riddle

19
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,039
and an old map of the town of Hagi.

20
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:27,839
As well as a picture of a cat drawn in the diary.

21
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:30,639
In search for clues, we went to visit Hagi.

22
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,239
I witnessed Shigeru

23
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,439
meeting the men who attacked Kimiko in Tokyo.

24
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:39,139
And finally, those mysterious men made their move.

25
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:48,439
"The Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour: Deciphering Chapter"

26
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:52,439
-Horrible people. -What should we do?

27
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,439
What we should do is to notify the police!

28
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,339
That's right, didn't someone say that the police was coming?

29
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:00,539
That voice.

30
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,939
Police! This way! Come quick!

31
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:07,539
I'm Shigeru Kawaguchi. Kimiko's friend!

32
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:10,739
That was unmistakably his voice that we heard.

33
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:14,239
It's from Ms. Kimiko's phone!

34
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,639
Put it on speakerphone!

35
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,939
Okay.

36
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:18,839
Press this button and...

37
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,239
Can you hear me?

38
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,239
We have the girl and kids here.

39
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,839
Find the treasure now.

40
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:28,239
If you delay, you know what will happen to them, right?

41
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,439
You!

42
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,439
Do not notify the police. Will contact you again.

43
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:35,739
Hello?

44
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:38,939
Ms. Kimiko? Hello?

45
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,139
We have to call the police!

46
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,539
We can't! If we do, they might harm them.

47
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:48,639
But there's no guarantee of their safety

48
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,039
just because we obey them either.

49
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,839
I understand.

50
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,839
Conan.

51
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:59,439
Mitsuhiko threw this before he got caught.

52
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,839
Mitsuhiko.

53
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:05,139
I see! I got it!

54
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:08,039
If you put this picture of the cat and the old map of Hagi...

55
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,739
When you turn over the map onto this...

56
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,439
They are the same shape!

57
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,839
Wow!

58
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:18,339
This cat is representing the map of Hagi.

59
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:23,139
And to "Reflect the castle in the eye of the cat" means...

60
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:26,239
place the cat eye and the position of the castle..

61
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,339
And the hole in the picture of the cat

62
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:30,739
should tell us where to go next!

63
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,239
I see!

64
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,339
If we go here, we should be able to solve

65
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:38,039
what it means by "look under the mouse"!

66
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:40,739
Mr. Mouri! I have notified the police!

67
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:46,939
Mr. Kikkawa, can you tell us where this is in Hagi?

68
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:48,239
Look here!

69
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:51,439
This is...

70
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,939
Enseiji Temple!

71
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:55,539
Then Enseiji Temple is where we're going!

72
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:58,239
We have to hurry.

73
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,539
"On November 30th,"

74
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:05,039
"only then, the sunset will show the truth of the treasure."

75
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,339
We only have until sunset!

76
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,739
You can take those off now.

77
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:16,039
I will tell you though, nobody can hear you from here.

78
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,439
Now stay there and don't try anything!

79
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:29,139
Stay here? They're really thinking we are just a couple of kids.

80
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:33,839
That's so true. We don't give up that easily.

81
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:39,039
-Conan? -Mitsuhiko?

82
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,039
You can hear me?

83
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,339
Mitsuhiko!

84
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:43,439
Is everyone all right?

85
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,139
They haven't done anything to you, I hope!

86
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:47,339
We are all okay.

87
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:49,239
We're in an underground.

88
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,939
What are you hiding there?

89
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:52,939
-Mitsuhiko! -What's going on?

90
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:54,839
Mitsuhiko!

91
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,539
Seems like someone needs to be taught a lesson!

92
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,739
Mitsuhiko! Mitsuhiko!

93
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,039
We lost contact.

94
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:08,439
You did contact the police, right?

95
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,539
Yes.

96
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,639
This is Enseiji Temple.

97
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,439
People such as Hirobumi Ito and Shinsaku Takasugi studied here.

98
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,739
"Look under the mouse."

99
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:23,239
What does it mean?

100
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:25,739
Wow! Look at that mask!

101
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:27,739
It's scary-looking!

102
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:30,639
What is it?

103
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,539
I found it! Right here!

104
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:36,239
I see a mouse!

105
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:38,839
The animals that represent the Chinese zodiac are decorated here.

106
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,839
I see, so it should be underneath here.

107
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,939
Under here?

108
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,939
I don't see anything.

109
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,539
Well, Kimiko's grandfather loved to play with words.

110
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:53,539
Maybe there is another twist to this.

111
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,639
"Mouse" is also similar to "Mouth."

112
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:58,339
That's it!

113
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:00,039
Mouth!

114
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:04,039
That means the treasure should be inside the mouth of this.

115
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:07,939
Oh, it says under, so it might be this?

116
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,939
I see. This is it.

117
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,439
What are those?

118
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,039
Those are the largest stone lantern in the prefecture.

119
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:24,239
The amazing thing is that some of the stones

120
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:27,239
holding up the lanterns are able to move around.

121
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,139
Got it.

122
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,939
-I found it. -Wow! You did it!

123
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:36,639
How did you figure it out?

124
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,839
That opening in the top of the lanterns are called "Higuchi"

125
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,739
which means "Fire Mouth".

126
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:44,839
I see, so this means "Under the mouth" as well.

127
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,139
And, what's this time?

128
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,439
This is...

129
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,139
What is this?

130
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:52,939
Another puzzle?

131
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:57,539
Wait. I've seen this before in the diary.

132
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,239
Look.

133
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:03,539
This paper was torn off from this diary.

134
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:08,439
Then these two pages are the next puzzle.

135
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:12,339
"Make the map in the cave where the water goblin lives."

136
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:16,939
There is only one cave that they say the water goblin lives.

137
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:18,939
You mean, they are real?

138
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:21,139
It's the Akiyoshi Cave.

139
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:24,739
So you know where the treasure is?

140
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:27,239
Are all three of them safe?

141
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,939
Do you know where the treasure is?

142
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:32,139
Let us hear their voices first!

143
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:36,539
So you do not care if you cannot hear their voices ever again.

144
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:42,239
It's the Akiyoshi Cave.

145
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,939
Hurry!

146
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:48,039
We don't have time!

147
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,039
Akiyoshi Cave is said to be

148
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,639
one of the largest limestone caves in Orient.

149
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:58,339
The sun is setting soon.

150
00:08:58,339 --> 00:08:59,439
Let's go!

151
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:05,639
"Make the map in the cave."

152
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,739
So there should be some hints in this cave

153
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:09,839
that would help us complete the map.

154
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,539
This is the "Ao-Tenjo" area.

155
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:15,039
The light coming from outside reflects on the water

156
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,839
and makes the ceiling blue.

157
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,039
What's this place?

158
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,739
It says, "Nagabuchi".

159
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:23,839
"Hyakumaizara".

160
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,139
It really does look like a hundred plates!

161
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:29,639
Just like the name! They're so interesting.

162
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,239
Hyakumaizara.

163
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:34,139
Nagabuchi. Ao-Tenjo.

164
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:37,139
Ao and Hyaku.

165
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:38,639
I get it!

166
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,239
What is it?

167
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,539
Look.

168
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:45,939
We take these apart.

169
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:47,739
What are you doing?

170
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:49,439
This is how it's supposed to be.

171
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:51,739
Look closely!

172
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:53,639
See the letters on the top left corner?

173
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,339
-Yeah. -Well, these are

174
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:59,339
all the first letter of the areas inside the Akiyoshi Cave.

175
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,839
See, this one is "Ao" from the "Ao-Tenjo" area, meaning "Blue".

176
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,839
This is "Naga" from "Nagabuchi", meaning "Long".

177
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,139
This means the Hyakumaizara area.

178
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,439
Look at the rest too!

179
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:12,139
Yes, you are correct.

180
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:15,739
And from there it goes from "Dounaifuji", "Kabocyaiwa",

181
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:20,239
"Oomatsutake", "Subogaki", "Chirimeniwa".

182
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:22,439
Those are the famous places in order.

183
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:25,239
So, if we put these pieces of papers

184
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:28,339
in order from the entrance...

185
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:30,739
What's going to happen?

186
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:32,439
See!

187
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:35,639
It's a map of a cave.

188
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,439
The "X" mark should be where the treasure is!

189
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,239
Look at the message here.

190
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:45,739
It says, "Wainori."

191
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:47,639
Actually, this one you read from right to left.

192
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,339
I see.

193
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:55,139
Kuroka, radetefu, tagonori, yuuki,

194
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:01,139
tsunei, wanokuchi, sakihika, rinoiwa?

195
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:04,139
It says, "Out from the black, the twin dragons,"

196
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:07,839
"on the tip of the foxes mouth, in the rock of light".

197
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,139
"Out of the black" should be...

198
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,239
Kurotaniguchi.

199
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:18,939
Kuro of "Kurotaniguchi" as in black, huh?

200
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:22,639
Then what is the "Twin dragons"?

201
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,039
Hey!

202
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,239
Do you know anywhere

203
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:27,939
that has two waterfalls lined up next to each other?

204
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,939
Two waterfalls?

205
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,839
There is one place halfway through the mountain here.

206
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,139
So that's what the twin dragons are about!

207
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:37,839
Then, right close to that.

208
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,239
We can find the fox rock!

209
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,739
Hurry!

210
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:43,839
Mr. Kikkawa!

211
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,639
Can I borrow that cell phone?

212
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,439
Sure. Of course.

213
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:50,739
But whom are you calling now?

214
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:55,239
It's better to wait. Sorry about that, thank you.

215
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:57,539
It's okay.

216
00:12:04,562 --> 00:12:07,562
This must be the twin dragons.

217
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:12,862
Then all we have to do is look for a fox-shaped rock!

218
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:16,362
But I don't see it anywhere.

219
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:18,562
Where could it be?

220
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:29,062
Over there.

221
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:31,462
Huh? Where is it?

222
00:12:31,462 --> 00:12:35,062
That rock? But it doesn't look like a fox.

223
00:12:35,062 --> 00:12:38,262
-The shadow. -The shadow?

224
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:42,762
Oh! It's a fox!

225
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,262
I see! It wasn't about the shape of the rock,

226
00:12:45,262 --> 00:12:47,462
but the shape of the shadow!

227
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:49,762
And on the tip of its mouth.

228
00:12:49,762 --> 00:12:52,162
That over there is the "Rock of Light".

229
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:58,862
There is a mirror inside this rock.

230
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,162
It has to be this day of the year

231
00:13:01,162 --> 00:13:03,462
to have the sun exactly shine into the mirror.

232
00:13:03,462 --> 00:13:05,962
Let's move this rock!

233
00:13:09,462 --> 00:13:11,662
The treasure should be inside here.

234
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:14,262
Yes, no doubt about it.

235
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:21,662
Genta, Ayumi, be careful!

236
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:24,062
Leave it to us!

237
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:26,362
The path breaks off into two directions.

238
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:27,962
Take a right.

239
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:30,562
Another right.

240
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:32,062
And another right.

241
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:35,262
Then left, and left.

242
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:38,362
Okay, right, right, right, and left, left!

243
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:42,262
Right, right, right, and left, left!

244
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:44,762
Why are you yelling?

245
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:48,262
I'm sorry, I got a little excited.

246
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:50,262
Next should be this way.

247
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,762
Almost there.

248
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:54,562
We turned left and...

249
00:13:54,562 --> 00:13:56,262
What?

250
00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:57,662
What is this place?

251
00:13:57,662 --> 00:14:00,462
It's beautiful!

252
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:02,862
This is where the treasure is!

253
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:05,762
This light must be from the moon

254
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,862
that's coming through the cracks of the ceiling.

255
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:12,062
How romantic.

256
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:14,462
Conan! Where is the treasure?

257
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:16,262
Right there!

258
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:21,862
Found it!

259
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,662
I'm opening it!

260
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:27,062
-We found it! -Yeah!

261
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:29,162
Not so fast!

262
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:31,362
Good job. All of you.

263
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:33,662
Ai! Mitsuhiko!

264
00:14:33,662 --> 00:14:35,562
Are you both all right?

265
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:38,462
Yes! We're both fine!

266
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,462
Hand over the treasure.

267
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,262
Then I'll release all of them!

268
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:46,662
-Ms. Kimiko! -Hurry up!

269
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,862
Dad!

270
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,962
Why don't you stop acting like a criminal?

271
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:03,462
You are disturbing the scenery here.

272
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:05,162
Mr. Mouri.

273
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:08,862
Why don't you come out from hiding, Shigeru?

274
00:15:08,862 --> 00:15:10,162
What?

275
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:21,262
Wha... what are you doing here?

276
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:23,062
Shigeru?

277
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:29,362
I believe that is not your real name.

278
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:33,062
Your pendant and Ms. Kimiko's cell phone strap is the same,

279
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:35,362
with your initials engraved in it.

280
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:38,162
It is "K.K" on Ms. Kimiko's strap.

281
00:15:38,162 --> 00:15:41,762
But yours says "A.T".

282
00:15:41,762 --> 00:15:44,662
And also, you had no problem

283
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:48,962
of getting those rare tickets for the train.

284
00:15:48,962 --> 00:15:50,462
So I suspected you have very strong connections

285
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:53,062
with the powerful people in the area.

286
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:55,962
Also, the man who was giving a speech in front of the station.

287
00:15:55,962 --> 00:15:57,762
Hisamichi Takahashi.

288
00:15:57,762 --> 00:15:59,962
He was an influential person in the area,

289
00:15:59,962 --> 00:16:02,162
announcing has candidacy for the prefectural assembly.

290
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,862
And...

291
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:07,462
To think such a splendid father could have a son like that...

292
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:10,262
Atsushi, right?

293
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:14,962
The son of Hisamichi Takahashi is named Atsushi.

294
00:16:14,962 --> 00:16:18,262
"Atsushi Takahashi".

295
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:21,162
So his initials would be "A.T."

296
00:16:21,162 --> 00:16:23,962
You definitely live up to the name of detective.

297
00:16:23,962 --> 00:16:26,862
I'm Atsushi Takahashi.

298
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:31,462
You were trying to stop these people, weren't you?

299
00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:34,162
When Ms. Kimiko and the others were taken.

300
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:36,662
Police! This way! Hurry!

301
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,662
That was you, wasn't it?

302
00:16:39,662 --> 00:16:44,862
That's right. It's out in the open now.

303
00:16:44,862 --> 00:16:48,462
Give up, Father!

304
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:50,662
You idiot!

305
00:16:54,862 --> 00:16:56,362
Hey, isn't that...

306
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:58,762
That person who was making the speech.

307
00:16:58,762 --> 00:17:01,562
When Atsushi knew what his father

308
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:05,562
was trying to do to Ms. Kimiko, he tried to stop it.

309
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:09,362
Yeah. I just heard about that yesterday.

310
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,662
It doesn't matter if it gets a little rough,

311
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:14,262
we have to get that no matter what!

312
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:18,462
And to tell her that, I went to Shin-Yamaguchi Station.

313
00:17:20,062 --> 00:17:23,062
Why did you do such a thing?

314
00:17:23,062 --> 00:17:24,762
Of course he would!

315
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:27,362
He did it to protect Ms. Kimiko.

316
00:17:27,362 --> 00:17:29,362
What?

317
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:33,562
Ms. Kimiko was very aware of the surroundings at the station.

318
00:17:33,562 --> 00:17:35,962
As though she didn't want anyone

319
00:17:35,962 --> 00:17:39,162
to see her with him.

320
00:17:39,162 --> 00:17:42,362
If someone knew about us,

321
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,162
we wouldn't be able to see each other.

322
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:45,662
Of course!

323
00:17:45,662 --> 00:17:48,762
That family has all the treasure of this land!

324
00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:51,062
I am different from the Kobayakawa family!

325
00:17:51,062 --> 00:17:54,162
I am going to use money to develop this town,

326
00:17:54,162 --> 00:17:56,062
for it to prosper!

327
00:17:56,062 --> 00:18:00,362
Shut up! For that purpose, you even kidnapped kids!

328
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:02,762
Let them go then!

329
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:05,062
There. Go ahead.

330
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:08,062
Father?

331
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:11,462
Atsushi.

332
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:12,962
Kimiko.

333
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,562
Mr. Kikkawa! What are you doing?

334
00:18:20,562 --> 00:18:21,862
Mr. Kikkawa?

335
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:24,162
So it was you,

336
00:18:24,162 --> 00:18:27,562
who told Mr. Takahashi about this treasure.

337
00:18:27,562 --> 00:18:30,562
Conan has looked into your cell phone.

338
00:18:30,562 --> 00:18:34,662
He says he did not see any call made to the police.

339
00:18:34,662 --> 00:18:38,962
And also you were shouting the directions out loud.

340
00:18:38,962 --> 00:18:43,262
So Mr. Takahashi and the others can hear you.

341
00:18:43,262 --> 00:18:44,962
No.

342
00:18:44,962 --> 00:18:47,862
Ms. Kimiko, I am so sorry.

343
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:50,462
My son failed in the stock market,

344
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,562
and he has huge debt with a financial company

345
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:55,062
under the Takahashi Group.

346
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:57,362
He promised me that he would write off that debt

347
00:18:57,362 --> 00:18:59,162
if I listened to him.

348
00:18:59,162 --> 00:19:03,162
I am very, very sorry.

349
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:05,462
Mr. Kikkawa.

350
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:07,462
What? This can't be!

351
00:19:07,462 --> 00:19:13,562
This cannot be the treasure!

352
00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:15,562
This is unbelievable!

353
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:21,562
It's a letter

354
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:25,462
that the ancestors of the Kobayakawa family wrote.

355
00:19:25,462 --> 00:19:27,262
Please read it for us.

356
00:19:27,262 --> 00:19:31,062
I have studied under the teacher, Shouin Yoshida.

357
00:19:31,062 --> 00:19:34,062
And I have learned about a great treasure that cannot change in time,

358
00:19:34,062 --> 00:19:36,862
whatever the world may be.

359
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:38,362
He says that,

360
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:39,962
"It is the goals we have in life"

361
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:42,462
"that are the beginning of all things."

362
00:19:42,462 --> 00:19:47,262
"It is having a purpose in one's life that gives rise to everything."

363
00:19:47,262 --> 00:19:48,862
According to his teachings,

364
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:52,562
we students with the ambition to make the country better.

365
00:19:52,562 --> 00:19:54,462
Shall come to see how we can make a difference

366
00:19:54,462 --> 00:19:55,962
in the real world.

367
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:58,162
From here on, no matter how bitter the winds

368
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:00,162
that may sweep over our world,

369
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:03,062
our greatest asset will be our ambition.

370
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:04,862
That we can change the people,

371
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:07,862
and give them the power to change the country.

372
00:20:07,862 --> 00:20:10,162
I must rely on my ability with my writing brush

373
00:20:10,162 --> 00:20:13,662
in order to communicate this to the generations to come.

374
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:15,462
The power to change the country?

375
00:20:15,462 --> 00:20:17,162
That's it!

376
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:20,162
It wasn't about buying a country,

377
00:20:20,162 --> 00:20:23,362
it was to change it!

378
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:29,162
Those who are unable to solve my riddle

379
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:33,262
does not have the right to inherit the words of my ancestor.

380
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:37,562
Shut up!

381
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:40,462
Hisamichi Takahashi!

382
00:20:40,462 --> 00:20:43,762
What worth is your ambition?

383
00:20:43,762 --> 00:20:46,262
I am asking you, what is the price

384
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:51,062
to buy your ambition, your goal?

385
00:20:51,062 --> 00:20:55,862
Is there any meaning to buy ambition with money?

386
00:20:55,862 --> 00:20:58,462
If it could be bought with money,

387
00:20:58,462 --> 00:21:01,462
it will disappear with the money used.

388
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:03,062
Isn't that right?

389
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:31,262
"One Week Later" -This is the Shoka Village School?

390
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:33,762
The people behind the Meiji Restoration

391
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:37,062
studied many different things here.

392
00:22:37,962 --> 00:22:39,562
He turned himself in?

393
00:22:39,562 --> 00:22:42,662
Yeah. Hisamichi Takahashi

394
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:45,262
did kidnap you and the others.

395
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:49,762
However Ms. Kimiko is denying the kidnapping.

396
00:22:49,762 --> 00:22:51,562
How naive of her.

397
00:22:51,562 --> 00:22:54,362
At any rate, what a waste.

398
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:57,362
The stamp, right?

399
00:22:57,362 --> 00:23:00,962
As for that old stamp that was on the letter,

400
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,662
that stamp had a printing error.

401
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:06,062
The characters on it were printed upside down.

402
00:23:06,062 --> 00:23:07,562
It seems it's something

403
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:11,862
worth tens of millions of yen among stamp collectors.

404
00:23:11,862 --> 00:23:15,962
Kimiko, if you were to send a letter to the future,

405
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:19,162
how much postage would you need?

406
00:23:19,162 --> 00:23:22,162
That stamp was his answer to that riddle.

407
00:23:22,162 --> 00:23:24,762
And for his descendant who finds that letter,

408
00:23:24,762 --> 00:23:27,262
it would give them funds to accomplish

409
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:29,962
whatever great things they desire to do.

410
00:23:32,462 --> 00:23:35,562
I will glue this back together.

411
00:23:35,562 --> 00:23:39,762
With my will, I shall.

412
00:23:44,062 --> 00:23:48,062
Man, what is the worth is your will?

413
00:24:00,062 --> 00:24:03,162
They've moved to a safer location

414
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:08,762
because I was looking around the house.

415
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:10,962
Don't mess with me!

416
00:24:10,962 --> 00:24:13,362
You, are the guilty one!

417
00:24:13,362 --> 00:24:14,862
Next Conan,

418
00:24:14,862 --> 00:24:18,962
"Accusation in Wine Red"

419
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:31,562
Next Conan's Hint:

420
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:33,962
"Tasting"

421
00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:35,262
The luxurious fragrance...

422
00:24:35,262 --> 00:24:36,762
as it spread in the mouth is astounding.

423
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:38,862
This fruit juice tastes good.
