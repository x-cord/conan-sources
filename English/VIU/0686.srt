1
00:00:34,123 --> 00:00:35,323
Wait!

2
00:00:35,323 --> 00:00:37,923
"Mao Misawa (5)" -Candy, wait!

3
00:00:37,923 --> 00:00:39,323
Candy!

4
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:50,323
Wait!

5
00:00:53,523 --> 00:00:54,923
Candy...

6
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,323
"2:30 pm"

7
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:00,323
"Time until explosion: 90 minutes"

8
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:02,923
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

9
00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:04,923
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

10
00:01:04,923 --> 00:01:06,523
A delivery van is loaded with a bomb.

11
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:08,823
The Youth Detective Squad only have seconds to carry out rescue.

12
00:01:08,823 --> 00:01:10,323
He sees through the one and only truth.

13
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:12,323
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

14
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:14,523
His name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:55,404 --> 00:03:00,404
"The Car Carrying the Time Bomb"

16
00:03:00,404 --> 00:03:01,904
"Mouri Detective Agency"

17
00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:04,004
How late is the Beika Library open again?

18
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:05,304
I wonder if we'll make it in time...

19
00:03:05,304 --> 00:03:07,304
Ayumi!

20
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:09,604
Candy's in trouble!

21
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:11,004
Mao?

22
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:12,404
What's the matter?

23
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:14,104
Who is it?

24
00:03:14,104 --> 00:03:15,504
If I remember correctly,

25
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:18,304
it's the girl who lives in Ayumi's neighborhood.

26
00:03:18,304 --> 00:03:19,404
What?

27
00:03:19,404 --> 00:03:23,204
Candy got on the delivery van and went along with it?

28
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:27,504
Ayumi, I don't know what to do.

29
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:29,204
Don't worry.

30
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:33,104
We, the members of the Youth Detective Squad will find her for you.

31
00:03:33,104 --> 00:03:35,304
So, don't worry.

32
00:03:37,604 --> 00:03:39,104
Let's go, Mao.

33
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:40,704
Ayumi.

34
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:43,404
Hey, hey, that's not work for the Detective Squad...

35
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:44,804
It is.

36
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:48,504
-Candy! -Candy!

37
00:04:00,604 --> 00:04:02,504
Isn't that the car?

38
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:03,504
Mao?

39
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:05,704
Yes, the one with the fox mark.

40
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,904
The FOX courier.

41
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:10,804
Candy! Candy!

42
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:11,904
Up we go.

43
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:15,404
Candy, where are you?

44
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:16,704
Candy.

45
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:18,104
What is it?

46
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:19,504
Hey, you!

47
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:22,004
Officer Chiba.

48
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:23,504
Conan?

49
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:25,104
She's not here.

50
00:04:25,104 --> 00:04:27,604
Looks like she's in a different car.

51
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:29,104
Candy.

52
00:04:29,104 --> 00:04:31,904
Don't worry, we'll find her soon.

53
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:36,404
You can count on us, the Youth Detective Squad, okay?

54
00:04:36,404 --> 00:04:38,404
-You can count on us. -Leave it to us!

55
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:42,104
Officer Chiba?

56
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:45,404
Did something happen?

57
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,604
Oh, no.

58
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:50,804
Hey, Chiba!

59
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:52,904
Nothing on this side. How about there?

60
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:56,004
Conan?

61
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,304
Are working on a case or something?

62
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:01,104
Yes, sort of.

63
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:03,304
Anyway, it's dangerous for you kids,

64
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:04,904
so hurry on home.

65
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:10,104
They seem to have gotten hold of one on 3rd Avenue, so let's go.

66
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:11,104
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:12,204
Be careful, then.

68
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:14,204
Good bye.

69
00:05:14,204 --> 00:05:15,504
Something's going on.

70
00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:17,104
Yes.

71
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:20,404
You guys wait here.

72
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,804
Hey, Conan?

73
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:23,604
You too, Ai!

74
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:25,404
For goodness sake.

75
00:05:28,004 --> 00:05:29,204
Hello.

76
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,404
Hello, Ran.

77
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:33,204
What is it, Conan?

78
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:37,004
What's Pops Kogoro doing now?

79
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,104
I'll go look, so hold on.

80
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:41,104
Please...

81
00:05:41,104 --> 00:05:43,404
One more, please.

82
00:05:43,404 --> 00:05:46,204
Oh, come on, dad.

83
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:48,304
Just as I thought.

84
00:05:49,804 --> 00:05:51,304
Never mind then.

85
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:53,304
It's nothing. Bye.

86
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:57,704
Yes, Megure here.

87
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,504
Inspector, this is Mouri.

88
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:01,504
Oh, it's you.

89
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:03,604
I'm sort of busy right now.

90
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:06,004
Does the case have something to do with a delivery van?

91
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:08,204
What? Where did you get that information?

92
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:12,404
I happened to see Officer Takagi and Chiba investigating.

93
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:13,604
I see.

94
00:06:13,604 --> 00:06:15,804
And what kind of case is it?

95
00:06:15,804 --> 00:06:17,404
No, I can't...

96
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:19,404
If it's something I can help out with,

97
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:20,704
please let me know.

98
00:06:22,204 --> 00:06:23,404
Inspector!

99
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:26,704
To tell you the truth, Mr. Mouri.

100
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:31,404
There were two successive explosions from late noon today.

101
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:32,604
What?

102
00:06:33,604 --> 00:06:35,304
The first victim was Kozo Tonomura,

103
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:37,804
a district court judge.

104
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:39,804
The second victim was Kazuhiko Saeki,

105
00:06:39,804 --> 00:06:41,704
a district attorney.

106
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:44,404
Although both victims were seriously hurt,

107
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,804
fortunately their lives are not in danger.

108
00:06:46,804 --> 00:06:51,704
Both were time bombs delivered by a courier.

109
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:56,304
From the fingerprints that were found on the debris of the first bomb,

110
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:58,704
a man called Utsugi,

111
00:06:58,704 --> 00:07:00,604
who was serving time in prison until last month,

112
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:03,504
was arrested on charges of violation of the explosives control law.

113
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:07,504
His motive was to take revenge on those who indicted and punished him,

114
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:09,804
that he held an unjustified grudge against.

115
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,704
According to Utsugi's testimony,

116
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:15,304
there's one more bomb that was sent out.

117
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:17,304
It went to an investigator

118
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,304
who had arrested him in the past.

119
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:22,104
I see.

120
00:07:22,104 --> 00:07:24,604
That's why they were investigating the courier trucks.

121
00:07:24,604 --> 00:07:25,704
Yes.

122
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:28,704
But, the bad thing is...

123
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:29,904
Inspector Megure!

124
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:33,004
We've confirmed that former Police Detective Kaneko is all right.

125
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:35,504
It seems the bomb hasn't been delivered to him yet.

126
00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:36,704
Okay.

127
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:39,104
If we're going to believe Utsugi's testimony,

128
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:41,604
the time remaining for the last bomb to go off

129
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:43,504
is 4:00 in the afternoon.

130
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,904
An hour and a half to go.

131
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:47,004
Inspector.

132
00:07:47,004 --> 00:07:50,704
We received an answer from the FOX courier.

133
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,704
About the reception desk slip for the package in question,

134
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:56,604
the delivery time has been specified

135
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:58,204
between 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm today.

136
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:00,604
And, where's the bomb now?

137
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:05,004
The courier company is trying to contact the delivery van right now.

138
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:08,104
We've asked to have the bomb squad dispatched too.

139
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,204
They'll head for the site as soon as it is found.

140
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:11,604
I see.

141
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:14,104
I guess we'll make it in time somehow.

142
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,904
Yes, hello.

143
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:21,604
What? The delivery van was stolen?

144
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:23,504
What?

145
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,904
Yes, this is van number four.

146
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:28,204
Bomb?

147
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:31,504
-Give me the key, I tell you! -What do you think you're doing?

148
00:08:42,204 --> 00:08:44,904
Kingo Ebisawa, 28 years old.

149
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:47,204
Ginji Kaniyama, 25 years old.

150
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:50,104
They both have previous police records of committing robbery.

151
00:08:50,104 --> 00:08:53,404
Before noon today, they broke into Marukane Loan in Beikacho

152
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:55,604
and robbed one million yen.

153
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:57,804
The two that were on the surveillance camera

154
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,704
and the description that the courier driver gave, matched.

155
00:09:01,904 --> 00:09:04,904
Marukane Loan? If I remember correctly...

156
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:08,304
Yes. That corrupted loan shark.

157
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:12,104
But why would they steal a delivery van?

158
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:15,404
It seems that their getaway car stalled,

159
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:18,604
and was abandoned nearby.

160
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:22,604
It was probably to intercept the wireless radio of the police.

161
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:26,104
There was a wireless also found in the car that they abandoned.

162
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:27,504
I see.

163
00:09:27,504 --> 00:09:31,004
That's why they robbed a delivery van equipped with a wireless too.

164
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:35,004
Yes. They're probably totally unaware that a bomb is loaded inside.

165
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:38,104
How could this have happened?

166
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,204
We're doing the best we can right now.

167
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:46,404
But, we still have no idea of the whereabouts of the delivery van.

168
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:47,804
I see.

169
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:50,604
By the way, where was the delivery van stolen?

170
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:54,404
In the residential district of 3-Beikacho.

171
00:09:54,404 --> 00:09:56,104
I see.

172
00:09:56,104 --> 00:10:00,204
Then, if I find anything here, I'll let you know.

173
00:10:00,204 --> 00:10:01,304
Thanks.

174
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:02,504
If you will excuse me...

175
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,504
Don't tell me it's that delivery van.

176
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:10,004
Yes, maybe...

177
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:13,604
Conan, how long do we have to stick around here?

178
00:10:13,604 --> 00:10:17,204
Really. Do you really want to look for Candy or not?

179
00:10:17,204 --> 00:10:19,404
Please the two of you!

180
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:22,204
Yes, of course we'll look for her.

181
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:26,804
Mao, where did Candy get on the delivery van?

182
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,304
From The Metropolitan Police Department to all stations.

183
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:31,404
Continue investigations centering around the area

184
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:33,404
where the getaway car of the robbers was found.

185
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:34,604
The vehicle to be pursued is a FOX delivery van.

186
00:10:34,604 --> 00:10:36,304
We did it!

187
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:39,904
Kinji. We can deceive the cops now and get away.

188
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:40,904
Yeah.

189
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:43,704
Thanks to you being a good mechanic.

190
00:10:45,204 --> 00:10:46,504
What's with you?

191
00:10:48,704 --> 00:10:50,604
You're cute.

192
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:54,204
"2:50 pm"

193
00:10:54,204 --> 00:10:55,504
"Time until explosion: 70 minutes"

194
00:10:56,204 --> 00:11:00,004
Right here. This is where Candy got on the FOX car.

195
00:11:00,004 --> 00:11:02,804
And, it turned that corner right away and you lost sight of it?

196
00:11:02,804 --> 00:11:04,604
Yes.

197
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:09,104
But... Isn't it no use to come here anymore?

198
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:12,504
I'm sure the van's gone far away by now.

199
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:17,004
But, at least we can get an idea of which direction it headed for.

200
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:18,004
Is it true?

201
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:21,504
Yeah. To the right is the exit of a one way street.

202
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:25,604
To the left, the street is under construction and closed off.

203
00:11:25,604 --> 00:11:27,104
All the side streets along the way

204
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:30,404
are not big enough for the delivery van to make it through.

205
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:31,704
Which means...

206
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:34,004
It went straight down this street!

207
00:11:34,004 --> 00:11:35,204
That's right.

208
00:11:35,204 --> 00:11:38,004
All right! Hurry, hurry!

209
00:11:39,904 --> 00:11:40,904
We did it!

210
00:11:40,904 --> 00:11:43,504
The cars are stalled because of a traffic jam.

211
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:46,104
At this rate, maybe we can catch up with the van.

212
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:50,204
But, which way?

213
00:11:50,204 --> 00:11:52,104
Right? Left?

214
00:11:52,104 --> 00:11:54,304
Which way do we go?

215
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:57,304
From the psychological state of the getaway culprits,

216
00:11:57,304 --> 00:11:59,804
it is highly improbable that they would cut across the traffic jam

217
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:01,604
and go over to the other side.

218
00:12:02,704 --> 00:12:04,104
This way.

219
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:06,304
Wait, Ai.

220
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:08,304
Hurry, hurry!

221
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:10,404
You're right, Ai.

222
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:12,404
Just in case.

223
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:13,904
Hello, Doctor Agasa?

224
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:23,604
Darn! Isn't there a way to bypass the traffic?

225
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:24,904
Come on, man!

226
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:29,004
Hey, Kinji, won't you stop by at a convenience store?

227
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:33,404
The dog and I are hungry.

228
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:35,604
What the heck is wrong with this?

229
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:37,504
Darn it! Darn it!

230
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:40,604
To think that they would even deliver a dog by courier.

231
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:43,304
They even forgot to write the address of where to send her.

232
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,104
Where are you going?

233
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:46,704
Only joke.

234
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:49,004
Cut out the noise.

235
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:51,904
Come on over here and do something about this navigator.

236
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,704
Hey, did you know?

237
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:55,804
That stuff can help people look for us,

238
00:12:55,804 --> 00:12:58,404
like tell them where we are and stuff.

239
00:12:58,404 --> 00:13:00,104
What?

240
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:02,704
I thought I saw it in a drama or something,

241
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:05,304
so I broke it when we got on.

242
00:13:05,304 --> 00:13:08,404
Oh, really? Good job.

243
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:19,204
There they are.

244
00:13:19,204 --> 00:13:20,604
300 meters ahead!

245
00:13:20,604 --> 00:13:21,904
We did it.

246
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:23,904
You're not getting away.

247
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:26,904
Candy.

248
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,204
No joke!

249
00:13:33,204 --> 00:13:34,304
Oh, no!

250
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:36,604
And we came all this way!

251
00:13:36,604 --> 00:13:37,704
Candy!

252
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:41,599
"3:10 pm"

253
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:43,257
"Time until explosion: 50 minutes"

254
00:13:46,737 --> 00:13:48,237
They're nowhere in sight.

255
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:49,737
Darn!

256
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:51,737
We almost caught up and yet.

257
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:52,837
Candy!

258
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:00,737
Mao, are you all right?

259
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,637
Sorry to keep you waiting.

260
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,837
-Doctor Agasa! -Doctor Agasa!

261
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:09,937
Good timing.

262
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:11,037
Hurry, Doctor Agasa.

263
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:12,037
I know.

264
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:25,137
So which way?

265
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:30,637
There not here.

266
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,737
Where'd they go?

267
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:35,437
They may have taken a side road again.

268
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:36,437
What?

269
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:39,337
We've got no way of finding them, then!

270
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,737
Now what?

271
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:43,237
It's going to explode and 4:00 pm, isn't it?

272
00:14:43,237 --> 00:14:45,237
We've only got 40 minutes more.

273
00:14:45,237 --> 00:14:47,437
-What? -Bomb!

274
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:50,637
Doctor...

275
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:54,137
You didn't know about it?

276
00:14:54,137 --> 00:14:55,937
-What do you mean? -What do you mean?

277
00:14:57,337 --> 00:15:00,137
I guess there's no choice but to tell them about it.

278
00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:02,837
Yeah. The thing is...

279
00:15:02,837 --> 00:15:06,137
A time bomb's going to explode at 4:00 pm?

280
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:09,637
Candy... What's going to happen to Candy?

281
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:12,837
Boy! What're the police doing?

282
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:14,637
Since they have the license plate number

283
00:15:14,637 --> 00:15:15,737
why don't they hurry up and pursue them

284
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:17,537
or set up road blocks or something?

285
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:18,837
What about the wireless?

286
00:15:18,837 --> 00:15:21,437
Why don't we try calling on them directly, and tell them that?

287
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:24,037
It's dangerous because a bomb is loaded in the car.

288
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:26,537
I'm sure they're doing all they can already.

289
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:29,337
But the fact is, I'm sure it's pretty difficult to specify

290
00:15:29,337 --> 00:15:33,837
which of the many FOX courier delivery vans that are going around town

291
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:35,537
is the one that's carrying the bomb.

292
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:36,937
Besides, it seems that the culprits

293
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:40,437
were listening to the wireless of the police to begin with.

294
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:43,237
If a checkpoint is carelessly set up or we call out to them by wireless,

295
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:45,037
and they decide to abandon the car somewhere,

296
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:46,337
it'll really be a problem.

297
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:48,537
Then, what should we do?

298
00:15:48,537 --> 00:15:51,137
Candy. Candy.

299
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:58,337
Sorry to keep you waiting, doggie!

300
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:01,437
Cute.

301
00:16:01,437 --> 00:16:02,837
May I carry it?

302
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:07,037
-So cute. -Okay, doggie, want to go?

303
00:16:07,037 --> 00:16:09,937
Hey, Ginji! Let's go!

304
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:12,437
Come on, just a little while more.

305
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:13,437
Geez.

306
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:15,437
"3:30 pm"

307
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:16,937
"Time until explosion: 30 minutes"

308
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:20,337
Okay! I've got no other choice.

309
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:22,737
You guys, wait here in the car.

310
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:26,937
Doctor, standby so that you can move the car out right away.

311
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:28,537
Okay.

312
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:29,937
Wait, Conan!

313
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:31,437
Hey, Conan!

314
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:32,937
What're you going to do?

315
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:36,737
Yes, Megure, here.

316
00:16:36,737 --> 00:16:38,037
This is Mouri.

317
00:16:38,037 --> 00:16:39,837
Inspector, if I remember correctly,

318
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:43,637
you said that the two were listening to police radio communication?

319
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:46,637
Yeah, that's how we see it.

320
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:50,737
If so, please do as I say from now.

321
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:53,537
Yeah.

322
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:55,037
What?

323
00:16:55,037 --> 00:16:57,437
But, that's...

324
00:16:59,637 --> 00:17:02,437
Okay, I got you.

325
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:05,737
Connect me to the communication control center immediately!

326
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:07,737
Contact Takagi and Chiba too!

327
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:11,037
Roger!

328
00:17:16,137 --> 00:17:19,337
Are you men really from FOX courier?

329
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:22,537
How come you're not wearing a uniform?

330
00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:24,737
The one with the FOX mark?

331
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:26,137
Ginji, let's go!

332
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:31,137
Oh, no.

333
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:33,937
If those kids notify the police...

334
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:35,237
Kingo.

335
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:37,137
If you speed like that, it won't be a laugh

336
00:17:37,137 --> 00:17:39,637
if you get caught for speeding.

337
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:41,837
Oh, yeah.

338
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:44,237
That's true.

339
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:46,137
From The Metropolitan Police Department to all stations,

340
00:17:46,137 --> 00:17:48,637
perform checkpoints from the following areas.

341
00:17:48,637 --> 00:17:50,937
All cars on the move, please take appropriate action.

342
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,737
From the intersection of Inner Circular Route 3-Kurinishi-cho,

343
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:55,237
to the intersection of Tenmondai Mae.

344
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:56,437
Kinji.

345
00:17:56,437 --> 00:17:59,837
Map! The map!

346
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:01,737
Looks bad, Kinji!

347
00:18:01,737 --> 00:18:04,037
If we keep going as is, well hit the checkpoint.

348
00:18:04,037 --> 00:18:06,537
What? Darn.

349
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:11,237
If... if we go that way, we'll run into the next checkpoint.

350
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:13,537
-Tell me earlier! -Go right here.

351
00:18:15,037 --> 00:18:17,637
Next, go left, then right!

352
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:22,937
Next, right, no, I mean left!

353
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:24,937
-Shape up! -The Haido intersection.

354
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,137
Next, next...

355
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:27,437
next, go left!

356
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:28,537
Okay!

357
00:18:34,937 --> 00:18:38,037
We did it! We got out of it!

358
00:18:38,037 --> 00:18:41,137
There are no more checkpoints, we've made it through!

359
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:49,037
There she is!

360
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:50,337
Candy!

361
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,637
Oh, yeah.

362
00:18:51,637 --> 00:18:53,437
Just as would be expected of Conan.

363
00:18:53,437 --> 00:18:55,137
How did you do it?

364
00:18:55,137 --> 00:18:57,337
I had Pops Kogoro tell Inspector Megure

365
00:18:57,337 --> 00:19:01,237
to give out false checkpoint information.

366
00:19:01,237 --> 00:19:03,037
I see.

367
00:19:03,037 --> 00:19:05,937
And you gave out directions for a side street out

368
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,537
and lured them there.

369
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:10,037
That's right.

370
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:13,937
The FOX delivery van there, freeze!

371
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,237
There!

372
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:18,637
Watch out!

373
00:19:20,437 --> 00:19:21,837
Bye.

374
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:23,937
"3:45 pm"

375
00:19:23,937 --> 00:19:25,437
"Time until explosion: 15 minutes"

376
00:19:25,437 --> 00:19:29,537
-It's not here. -It's not here...

377
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:31,737
The bomb's still in the delivery van.

378
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:32,737
What?

379
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:34,137
Candy?

380
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:36,137
Doctor, open the trunk!

381
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:38,837
Hurry. Only 12 minutes to go.

382
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:49,237
No.

383
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:50,337
Not this either.

384
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:54,637
Hey, so, you're Candy?

385
00:19:54,637 --> 00:19:57,137
Hey! What do you think you're doing, kid?

386
00:19:59,237 --> 00:20:00,837
I found it.

387
00:20:00,837 --> 00:20:02,737
Darn, there's not enough time.

388
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:05,337
I can't possibly throw it out in a place like this.

389
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:08,637
Hey, sirs!

390
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:11,637
Can you take me to some place spacious?

391
00:20:11,637 --> 00:20:13,037
This is a bomb!

392
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:15,637
-Bomb? -Bomb?

393
00:20:15,637 --> 00:20:18,737
No way.

394
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:20,437
Throw him out.

395
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:22,237
Okay! Hey, Kinji.

396
00:20:22,237 --> 00:20:23,437
It's true!

397
00:20:23,437 --> 00:20:25,637
Two others were delivered by the delivery van

398
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:27,437
and people have already gotten hurt too!

399
00:20:27,437 --> 00:20:29,237
This is the last one.

400
00:20:29,237 --> 00:20:31,737
It'll explode in a little while.

401
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:44,937
Kid, hang onto something!

402
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:46,637
Ginji! The map!

403
00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:47,837
Okay, Kinji!

404
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:54,537
There's no place, none, nearby.

405
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:56,037
Let me see.

406
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:57,137
Two more minutes to go.

407
00:20:57,137 --> 00:20:58,437
I know!

408
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:00,537
Where? Where are they?

409
00:21:01,537 --> 00:21:02,637
There they are!

410
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:06,837
Go here!

411
00:21:08,137 --> 00:21:09,837
Darn.

412
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:12,237
Where? Where are they?

413
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,637
One minute to go.

414
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:15,137
There's no more time.

415
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:16,437
Don't give up.

416
00:21:19,137 --> 00:21:20,237
20 seconds to go.

417
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,537
Where are you?

418
00:21:21,537 --> 00:21:22,737
10 seconds to go!

419
00:21:27,137 --> 00:21:28,637
-There they are! -Three,

420
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,037
two, one.

421
00:21:37,237 --> 00:21:38,637
Oh, no.

422
00:21:38,637 --> 00:21:40,337
Too late.

423
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,437
Awesome!

424
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:52,837
That was close.

425
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,137
Cut it out.

426
00:21:55,137 --> 00:21:58,537
Okay, okay.

427
00:21:58,537 --> 00:21:59,537
Candy.

428
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:09,737
-Candy. -The Youth Detective Squad does it again!

429
00:23:32,837 --> 00:23:35,437
Well, just as would be expected of Mouri.

430
00:23:35,437 --> 00:23:36,937
"Mouri Detective Agency" -It was fantastic.

431
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:41,137
Well, I can't take anymore.

432
00:23:43,137 --> 00:23:46,937
Really! It's about time you got up, dad.

433
00:23:54,437 --> 00:23:57,437
He died of a traffice accident last year.

434
00:24:00,037 --> 00:24:02,537
-Awesome! -Awesome...

435
00:24:02,537 --> 00:24:03,637
Thank you.

436
00:24:03,637 --> 00:24:06,537
But, father left saying that he was going to see you.

437
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:08,937
Who I didn't see, I didn't see!

438
00:24:11,637 --> 00:24:14,537
To tell the truth, I saw it...

439
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:17,037
The village head's ghost.

440
00:24:17,037 --> 00:24:18,437
Next Conan,

441
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:22,537
"An Unsolvable Ice Trap".
