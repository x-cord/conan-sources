1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:02,477
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,478 --> 00:00:04,277
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,278 --> 00:00:05,677
A red trace is left behind at the site of the crime.

4
00:00:05,678 --> 00:00:07,177
A case that goes according to a novel.

5
00:00:07,178 --> 00:00:08,977
The mystery of the invisible culprit!

6
00:00:08,978 --> 00:00:10,377
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:12,077
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:14,478
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,140
"Beika Station."

10
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:04,349
"Yasutaro Sasamoto (32), Office Worker."

11
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:16,549
What is that?

12
00:02:19,295 --> 00:02:21,495
Don't tell me that he was...

13
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:27,794
Shadow?

14
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:29,095
Hikage.

15
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:35,195
"Toshiyuki Kamio."

16
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:38,695
"Shadow."

17
00:02:40,195 --> 00:02:41,994
Yes, this is Kamio.

18
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,294
This is Sasamoto. Are you sleeping?

19
00:02:44,295 --> 00:02:46,994
I had to keep a writer company

20
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:48,994
and I came home in the wee hours of the morning.

21
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:49,995
What's up?

22
00:02:49,996 --> 00:02:52,994
Hikage... Hikage appeared!

23
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:54,294
He attacked you?

24
00:02:54,295 --> 00:02:56,194
Just now, on my way to the station.

25
00:02:56,195 --> 00:02:57,894
I'll be right over so stay there.

26
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:00,594
If I grab a cab, I can be there in 30 minutes.

27
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:01,895
Do that, will you?

28
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:10,594
"Toshiyuki Kamio (32), Editor" -Kamio!

29
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:12,194
"Toshiyuki Kamio (32), Editor."

30
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:14,494
"Shadow" -No doubt about it.

31
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:17,594
It's just as you said, after all.

32
00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:19,395
Let's report this to the police.

33
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:21,095
Kamio!

34
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:23,394
But I wonder if they'll believe us, though?

35
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:25,394
But, we don't have a choice.

36
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:28,894
Right! Let's hire a detective for now.

37
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:31,194
You were almost killed?

38
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:34,394
Please, protect us!

39
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:35,994
We know who the culprit is.

40
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:38,994
He's Teiichi Hikage, a member of the mystery research club

41
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:41,194
that we belonged to in our university days.

42
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:43,494
Why do you say that he's the culprit?

43
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:48,594
About six months ago, I got a manuscript from Hikage.

44
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,694
A manuscript?

45
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:51,194
Of a novel.

46
00:03:51,195 --> 00:03:52,594
A novel that predicted friends of the past

47
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:54,394
would be killed one after the other.

48
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:57,294
A novel predicting murder.

49
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:59,795
A novel predicting murder?

50
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:06,895
"So, Disappear Everybody."

51
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:10,594
You would've been in big trouble if it hit you.

52
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:13,794
Unmistakably dead.

53
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,094
Just one word "Shadow" written in red paint...

54
00:04:17,095 --> 00:04:19,494
How distasteful.

55
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:21,794
Hikage was always that way since our university days.

56
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,494
Although he used to type his novels,

57
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:27,794
the cover of his novels were always written in revolting red characters.

58
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:30,594
Sunglasses and long hair.

59
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:32,995
It's unmistakably Hikage.

60
00:04:33,595 --> 00:04:36,194
So, you received the novel in question

61
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:38,794
from Mr. Hikage six months ago?

62
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:42,694
There were several members in the mystery research club,

63
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:45,694
but four of us in particular were passionately active members.

64
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,894
Sasamoto, myself,

65
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:49,694
Takeshi Nezu,

66
00:04:49,695 --> 00:04:51,894
and Hikage.

67
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:54,494
But, we had practically no opportunity to see each other

68
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,394
since we graduated.

69
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:59,094
However, coincidentally six months ago, that manuscript

70
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:03,394
was delivered to the mystery magazine editing section that I work at.

71
00:05:03,395 --> 00:05:07,294
Unfortunately, his novel, "So, Disappear Everybody",

72
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:10,494
it was not a work that could be called a mystery.

73
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:12,194
It had no tricks or mysteries.

74
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:14,394
It was just a story of revenge that pointed out that

75
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:17,794
the main character would kill three of his university friends

76
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,395
because of a grudge he had against them.

77
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:23,694
Even harder to understand

78
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:26,894
were the names of the three who are predicted to be killed.

79
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:31,194
Takeshi Nezu, Toshiyuki Kamio, and Yasutaro Sasamoto.

80
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:33,894
In other words, those are our names.

81
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:36,894
The meaning of the queer novel was finally clarified

82
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,194
the day before yesterday.

83
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:39,794
The day before yesterday?

84
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:41,994
The night before yesterday, the dead body of a man

85
00:05:41,995 --> 00:05:43,894
who had been stabbed in the back with a knife

86
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:45,495
was found in Beika Park.

87
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:51,395
The man who was killed was a former member of our club, Takeshi Nezu.

88
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:55,494
And, also written in the novel that was sent by Hikage to me.

89
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:58,494
Takeshi Nezu dies, stabbed in the back from behind

90
00:05:58,495 --> 00:06:00,494
in a park at night.

91
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:03,295
Please let me read that novel!

92
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:07,394
I see.

93
00:06:07,395 --> 00:06:09,994
The method of murder is also the same.

94
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,394
I guess this is no coincidence.

95
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:14,094
It's not a coincidence for sure.

96
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:16,594
This novel is indeed a prediction of murder.

97
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:18,594
But something's not right.

98
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:23,094
Although the details of the way Mr. Nezu will be killed is written,

99
00:06:23,095 --> 00:06:24,794
when it comes to the way and place.

100
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:27,794
Mr. Sasamoto and Mr. Kamio will be killed,

101
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:29,494
there is no detailed description.

102
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:31,695
Oh. That's right.

103
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:34,694
That's why it's so eerie.

104
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,594
We have no idea when and how he's going to attack us.

105
00:06:37,595 --> 00:06:39,494
It says that his motive for revenge

106
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:41,494
is because the novel he wrote in the past

107
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:45,694
was severely criticized by all three of you?

108
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:49,294
It's true that there was a time when we did. Right?

109
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:51,194
There was, but...

110
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:54,194
But such a setting is impossible in this day and age.

111
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:56,694
Even the trick is sort of old fashioned.

112
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:58,894
Your writing style is... you know.

113
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:01,594
It's too emotional and exaggerated.

114
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:04,894
It's basically lacking reality.

115
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:07,394
But, it goes for all of us!

116
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:11,194
There was a time when Hikage really razzed Kamio's work too.

117
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:14,194
What's interesting about this story, Kamio?

118
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:16,394
I think it's pretty good.

119
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:19,094
Why don't you crack your head in two and wash your brains out?

120
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:21,994
This story is totally hopeless.

121
00:07:21,995 --> 00:07:23,994
I mean we all said and heard our share and yet...

122
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:27,794
Why would he want to take revenge 10 years after graduation.

123
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:30,694
True. Why now?

124
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:32,794
Have you seen Mr. Hikage recently?

125
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:34,494
No, I haven't.

126
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,895
Rather...

127
00:07:38,395 --> 00:07:41,294
I thought he died long ago.

128
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,594
Died?

129
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,894
Hikage suddenly disappeared three years ago.

130
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:47,994
He went mountain climbing alone

131
00:07:47,995 --> 00:07:50,394
and never came back since.

132
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:54,194
So, we all thought that he had an accident in the mountains and died.

133
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:56,894
But, he was in fact, alive!

134
00:07:56,895 --> 00:08:00,594
So, a man that everybody thought had died three years ago

135
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:03,694
suddenly began committing murder to take revenge.

136
00:08:03,695 --> 00:08:05,294
Mr. Kamio.

137
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:07,694
There's a parcel here for you.

138
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,295
A parcel?

139
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:13,394
Did you win an award or something?

140
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:15,695
I wonder if I submitted and applied for something.

141
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,194
What? Don't tell me that it's...

142
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:21,395
Wait! Don't open!

143
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:34,094
Well, that was close.

144
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:36,794
It could've been worse if there was more gun powder inside.

145
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:38,794
He probably miscalculated the amount.

146
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:41,694
He miscalculated the amount of gun powder?

147
00:08:41,695 --> 00:08:44,694
Was it a mistake or was it...

148
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:48,094
I guess it's safe to conclude that Teiichi Hikage did this.

149
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:51,094
This was enclosed inside the parcel with the explosive.

150
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:52,594
"Shadow."

151
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:54,494
It's Hikage after all.

152
00:08:54,495 --> 00:08:57,594
As a matter of fact, although it hasn't been publicized,

153
00:08:57,595 --> 00:09:00,195
"Shadow" -beneath the dead body of Mr. Takeshi Nezu...

154
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:05,794
I think that it'd be better if you keep yourself hidden here

155
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,895
at the hospital for a while, Mr. Kamio.

156
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:11,194
I'll keep guard over you.

157
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:13,894
I've already got approval from the editor

158
00:09:13,895 --> 00:09:16,494
so you can work while staying here.

159
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:17,695
Oh.

160
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:22,994
Since you're a salesman, you can't be confined to a place.

161
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,894
We'll guard you, both Mr. Mouri and I together.

162
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:27,494
Please do, thank you.

163
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:29,194
And, as for you...

164
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:31,595
-I'll... -Go home immediately!

165
00:09:32,495 --> 00:09:34,295
I thought you'd say that.

166
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:39,194
I'll be counting on you, then.

167
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:40,894
Goodbye.

168
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:42,394
As for the whereabouts of Mr. Teiichi Hikage,

169
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:44,494
the officers have split up to search for him.

170
00:09:44,495 --> 00:09:47,795
I hope you get to find where he's hiding.

171
00:09:51,195 --> 00:09:53,995
If I stay and keep tight watch over him...

172
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,495
Granny!

173
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,094
It hurts.

174
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:00,594
Are you all right?

175
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:02,295
My hips.

176
00:10:06,495 --> 00:10:07,595
Look out!

177
00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:11,494
Hold it!

178
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:13,094
It's Hi... Hikage.

179
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:14,294
Hikage!

180
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:15,394
Don't worry!

181
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:19,495
As long as I'm here with you, I won't let him kill you!

182
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:23,494
After the explosive, comes the car.

183
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:24,695
What's with this guy?

184
00:10:32,995 --> 00:10:34,494
Just as I thought.

185
00:10:34,495 --> 00:10:38,494
That car came charging but braked once along the way.

186
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:40,494
Something's not right.

187
00:10:40,495 --> 00:10:42,894
The parcel with the explosives inside

188
00:10:42,895 --> 00:10:44,994
lacked the correct amount of explosive.

189
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:47,394
It looks to be just plain threat.

190
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:50,995
But, the first man Mr. Takeshi Nezu was killed.

191
00:10:51,795 --> 00:10:53,794
What is the difference that the killer is feeling

192
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:55,894
towards Mr. Nezu, Mr. Kamio and Mr. Sasamoto?

193
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:59,195
Why this inconsistency in the crime?

194
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:01,794
Good morning!

195
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,794
Oh, good morning.

196
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:06,694
I'm counting on you today, too.

197
00:11:06,695 --> 00:11:10,094
Unfortunately, we lost track of the car yesterday,

198
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:11,594
but if he appears again, we'll arrest him for sure.

199
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:14,295
Oh, excuse me.

200
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:17,694
Who is it?

201
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:18,695
Yes?

202
00:11:18,696 --> 00:11:21,294
Long time no see, it's me.

203
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:22,595
Hikage?

204
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:24,794
I'm not getting anywhere with you being guarded

205
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:26,794
by a detectives and police detectives

206
00:11:26,795 --> 00:11:28,894
so I'm going to pull away for a while.

207
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,694
He's going to pull out?

208
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:32,694
But, it's not that I'm giving up.

209
00:11:32,695 --> 00:11:35,694
I'll get to you one day when I get the chance.

210
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,094
Why, Hikage? Hikage?

211
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:40,295
Excuse me.

212
00:11:41,295 --> 00:11:42,594
Mr. Kamio.

213
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:44,594
Hikage called and...

214
00:11:44,595 --> 00:11:46,594
I got a call from him too just now.

215
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:48,494
It seems he's given up.

216
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:49,894
So, I'm relieved.

217
00:11:49,895 --> 00:11:52,494
But, we can't just drop the case as is.

218
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:53,894
Of course not.

219
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:56,694
Teiichi Hikage has committed murder.

220
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,395
We've got to arrest him no matter what.

221
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:04,294
Oh, yes, this is Takagi.

222
00:12:04,295 --> 00:12:05,295
Yes.

223
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:07,994
Is that right?

224
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:10,295
Okay, thanks.

225
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:12,094
What is it?

226
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:15,294
They can't find the whereabouts of Teiichi Hikage.

227
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:16,794
Since his disappearance three years ago,

228
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:19,095
nobody has had contact with him.

229
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:20,995
Darn it!

230
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:24,694
He should've written where he'd be hiding

231
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:25,994
while he was at it writing this stuff!

232
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,894
If his motive dates back to a grudge in the past,

233
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:31,694
there could be a clue in the novels he wrote in his university days.

234
00:12:31,695 --> 00:12:33,994
Novels during our university days.

235
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:35,494
Do you have any?

236
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:38,494
I have some magazines issued by Mystery Investigation Club in my room.

237
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:40,595
Hikage's novels are printed in them too.

238
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,395
How is it? Anything there?

239
00:12:46,495 --> 00:12:48,994
There seems to be no clue.

240
00:12:48,995 --> 00:12:51,595
None here, either.

241
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:56,295
This style of writing, if I remember correctly...

242
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,395
Just as I thought!

243
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:04,594
But if so, why?

244
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:05,895
Why?

245
00:13:06,895 --> 00:13:11,095
Why did he do something like this?

246
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:16,487
We struck at air, I guess.

247
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:18,775
He may be waiting for a chance to attack

248
00:13:18,776 --> 00:13:21,875
after throwing us off guard by declaring to pull out for a while.

249
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:24,475
We've got to hurry and find Teiichi Hikage.

250
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:27,875
I have an appointment to see a writer today.

251
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:30,575
Okay. I'll accompany you.

252
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,075
Hey, Officer Takagi.

253
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:33,675
Conan?

254
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:37,275
What kind of a person was Mr. Takeshi Nezu, who was killed?

255
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:38,476
What?

256
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:42,275
I hate to say this,

257
00:13:42,276 --> 00:13:44,475
but he didn't have a very good reputation.

258
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:46,175
They are people who say that they lent him money

259
00:13:46,176 --> 00:13:48,275
but he never returned it.

260
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:49,476
Money?

261
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:54,875
You mean, Nezu to me?

262
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,775
Yes, did he say something about money to you?

263
00:13:58,776 --> 00:14:00,075
Come to think of it,

264
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:03,675
he did mention he had money, he could count on to be coming in.

265
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,675
Although I can't be too sure about that.

266
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:07,175
He mentioned something about an incident

267
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:08,975
that occurred three years ago being involved.

268
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:10,476
Incident three years ago?

269
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:13,575
Is it about Mr. Hikage's disappearance?

270
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:16,975
Mr. Hikage was more down to earth than he looked.

271
00:14:16,976 --> 00:14:19,575
He kept saying that he would become a professional writer

272
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:21,375
and continued to write day after day.

273
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:23,575
But, I guess it didn't work out the way he planned after all.

274
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:25,075
It didn't work out?

275
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:27,575
I think it was two or three days before he disappeared.

276
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,475
He was burning the novels he had written

277
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:30,875
in the open lot behind here.

278
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:33,375
He did so crying in front of his friend.

279
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:34,676
Friend?

280
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,976
Do you see that person in this picture?

281
00:14:39,976 --> 00:14:41,575
Oh!

282
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:43,376
Him!

283
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:47,275
No good? You mean this masterpiece?

284
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:49,775
He told me so.

285
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:52,475
That it's totally hopeless.

286
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:55,675
I wonder what I worked so hard for all these seven years.

287
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:58,775
And, it was right afterwards that he disappeared, right?

288
00:14:58,776 --> 00:15:01,075
So, I figured that

289
00:15:01,076 --> 00:15:05,475
maybe he lost hope and committed suicide in the mountains.

290
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:07,476
So, that's the story.

291
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:12,975
What? I called all of you?

292
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:15,575
Yeah. You said that the mystery has been solved.

293
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:17,475
Solve or not solve,

294
00:15:17,476 --> 00:15:20,776
as to the case this time, don't have the slightest idea.

295
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:27,475
Mr. Mouri? Did it start?

296
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:29,076
Sleeping Kogoro.

297
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:32,175
Grudge held back in the university days.

298
00:15:32,176 --> 00:15:35,075
Behind the case this time, this is what is involved.

299
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:37,475
I mean all know that already, don't we?

300
00:15:37,476 --> 00:15:41,975
Mr. Teiichi Hikage himself says so in his novel.

301
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:45,875
Mr. Hikage is not involved in the case this time.

302
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:48,676
-Pardon? -Not involved?

303
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:51,875
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

304
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:54,675
It seems that Mr. Hikage was seriously continuing

305
00:15:54,676 --> 00:15:58,175
to write novels in hopes of becoming a professional writer

306
00:15:58,176 --> 00:16:00,175
even after graduating from university.

307
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:02,075
I know that.

308
00:16:02,076 --> 00:16:04,175
But, he was troubled by not being able to write something

309
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:05,875
he felt confident of.

310
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:09,775
However, three years ago, Mr. Hikage finally completed

311
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:12,975
a novel he was confident of a masterpiece.

312
00:16:12,976 --> 00:16:14,875
He took this novel

313
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:17,275
to a friend who once belonged in the same club,

314
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,575
and one who is presently working

315
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:21,275
in the editing section of a mystery magazine, Mr. Kamio.

316
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:24,476
He brought it to you, didn't he, Mr. Kamio?

317
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:27,575
Is that true, Kamio?

318
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:30,575
You've got the talent to pick out good stories,

319
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:33,975
so you figured out right away that his story was a masterpiece.

320
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:35,775
However, you...

321
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:37,676
What do you think, Kamio?

322
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:41,376
It's totally hopeless.

323
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:43,875
You probably did so

324
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:46,475
to take revenge on him for rejecting your novel

325
00:16:46,476 --> 00:16:51,275
that you were confident of in your university days.

326
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:56,075
Mr. Hikage took your words for fact and lost all hope.

327
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:57,775
As a result, he ended up taking his own life.

328
00:16:57,776 --> 00:16:59,275
It can't be.

329
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:01,875
Mr. Kamio as well my life is being sought after by Hikage right now,

330
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:04,275
so how can that be? Right?

331
00:17:04,276 --> 00:17:07,475
-Yeah. -When Mr. Hikage disappeared,

332
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:10,775
I'm sure Mr. Kamio understood that.

333
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:15,875
He may have driven Mr. Hikage to his death by his remark.

334
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:19,575
I'm sure Mr. Kamio suffered for three years regretting what he had done.

335
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:23,075
And moreover, tried to forget the whole thing.

336
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,875
But, half a month ago,

337
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:26,875
one of the members of the club in the past,

338
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:29,575
Mr. Takeshi Nezu appeared before you,

339
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:31,576
and started blackmailing you.

340
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:36,675
You drove Hikage to his death three years ago, didn't you?

341
00:17:36,676 --> 00:17:38,775
I guess I hit the bull's eye.

342
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:41,376
I read that novel which Hikage wrote.

343
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:47,575
The thing is, I sort of need some money, you see.

344
00:17:47,576 --> 00:17:51,875
I figure money was not much of a problem to you.

345
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:54,875
You just couldn't bear the fact that someone knew about

346
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:57,075
the bitter past that you wanted to forget.

347
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,975
You wanted to erase Mr. Nezu from this world.

348
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:02,775
But, if you killed him just like that,

349
00:18:02,776 --> 00:18:05,875
you figured that you'd be suspected.

350
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,575
Therefore, you decided to make it look like

351
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:11,275
the doings of Mr. Teiichi Hikage, a person who didn't exist.

352
00:18:11,276 --> 00:18:13,775
You thought up a motive for the murder,

353
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:15,675
which was a grudge that he held against everyone

354
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:17,575
for criticizing his work during university days.

355
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:23,075
But, Mr. Nezu wasn't the only one who criticized his work.

356
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:25,475
If it's a grudge revenge, it would be strange

357
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:28,075
if Mr. Sasamoto and yourself as well is not a target.

358
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:30,975
In order to make people believe that.

359
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,775
Hikage was trying to exact his revenge,

360
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:37,976
you wrote "So, Disappear Everybody."

361
00:18:38,976 --> 00:18:41,675
You wrote it?

362
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:43,675
Then, just as you had written,

363
00:18:43,676 --> 00:18:46,375
you stabbed Mr. Nezu in the park at night.

364
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,475
Next, you disguised yourself as Mr. Hikage

365
00:18:48,476 --> 00:18:50,576
and attacked Mr. Sasamoto.

366
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:53,175
Hikage appeared!

367
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:54,975
I'll be right over so stay there.

368
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:57,175
If I grab a cab, I can be there in 30 minutes.

369
00:18:57,176 --> 00:19:00,175
You answered as if you took the call at your residence,

370
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:01,975
and got there 30 minutes later

371
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:05,575
pretending to have arrived there from your home.

372
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:07,775
You went on to make it look as if you, yourself

373
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:10,575
was also being attacked by Mr. Hikage.

374
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:14,276
You waited for an opportunity to sneak out of your hospital room.

375
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:16,775
You disguised yourself as Mr. Hikage

376
00:19:16,776 --> 00:19:19,375
and attacked Mr. Sasamoto with a car.

377
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:21,175
Then, you lowered the curtains to your show

378
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:23,475
-by using Mr. Hikage's tone of voice. -Hikage?

379
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:26,475
This line of thinking fits everything in place.

380
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:29,875
It even explains the inconsistency in the culprit's actions.

381
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:32,075
The only person you wanted to kill

382
00:19:32,076 --> 00:19:35,375
to begin with was Mr. Nezu.

383
00:19:35,376 --> 00:19:38,275
Isn't that right, Mr. Kamio?

384
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:39,576
No way.

385
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:43,375
It's all deduction, Mr. Mouri.

386
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:45,075
You have no evidence whatsoever.

387
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:48,875
Mr. Sasamoto fortunately remembered.

388
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:52,675
The name of the company of the cab that you rode yesterday.

389
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:54,775
The driver remembered you and told us that

390
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,975
there was a queer man who flagged him down near the site of the crime,

391
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:01,275
but got off after riding only a several hundred meters.

392
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:03,675
That's only the testimony of an eye-witness.

393
00:20:03,676 --> 00:20:05,975
It's possible that this man was someone who resembled you a lot.

394
00:20:05,976 --> 00:20:09,075
But, that's not all.

395
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:11,075
Oh, this man!

396
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,275
Of all things, give me a break.

397
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:14,276
It just wouldn't come off, this thing.

398
00:20:14,976 --> 00:20:17,775
When you got rid of the red paint,

399
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:21,275
you used some paint happened to stick to the back sole of your shoes.

400
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:24,875
Mr. Kamio, could you let us take a look

401
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:26,776
at the sole of your shoes?

402
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:32,375
Kamio.

403
00:20:32,376 --> 00:20:34,675
When and how did you figure out

404
00:20:34,676 --> 00:20:36,975
that I was the one who did it, Mr. Mouri?

405
00:20:36,976 --> 00:20:38,776
That novel.

406
00:20:39,576 --> 00:20:41,975
"So, Disappear Everybody."

407
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:46,475
From the time I realized that you, not Mr. Teiichi Hikage

408
00:20:46,476 --> 00:20:48,475
wrote that novel.

409
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:51,475
The style. The writing style.

410
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:53,075
Style of writing?

411
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:57,675
The writing style of that novel is obviously different from the one

412
00:20:57,676 --> 00:21:00,776
that Mr. Hikage had written in the past.

413
00:21:01,976 --> 00:21:06,675
Mr. Hikage's novel had a lot of marks that expressed emotion.

414
00:21:06,676 --> 00:21:11,275
But, there was nothing like that in the novel you showed us.

415
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:13,775
You didn't even use the dotted lines to describe the spaces in between,

416
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:15,975
and you wrote everything using just plain underlines.

417
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:18,975
An extremely restrained way of writing.

418
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:24,576
Yes, very much like that novels that you used to write in the past.

419
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:29,775
Habits of writing style are not easy to revise

420
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:31,575
no matter how many years go by.

421
00:21:31,576 --> 00:21:33,675
Writers in particular, tend to stick and have a special feeling

422
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:35,275
towards their writing style.

423
00:21:35,276 --> 00:21:38,975
You have no way out, Mr. Kamio, from something that

424
00:21:38,976 --> 00:21:42,575
you had harboured inside for a long period of time.

425
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:43,876
Kamio.

426
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:51,676
Harbored for a long period of time?

427
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:31,476
I'm going to wash my face.

428
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:42,675
Prediction of murder! Right here!

429
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:44,675
A red "shadow"! It's written right here!

430
00:23:44,676 --> 00:23:46,275
See, right here.

431
00:23:46,276 --> 00:23:47,775
Help me, Conan!

432
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:50,276
Call the police, will you?

433
00:23:52,276 --> 00:23:54,876
I think that's a trace of you drooling.

434
00:23:57,976 --> 00:24:00,275
Shoots! It's no fun.

435
00:24:00,276 --> 00:24:03,676
We come all this way, and they're not going to be shooting the film?

436
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:07,976
Oh, it's started?

437
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:18,176
The seatbelt is unfastened.

438
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,776
Maybe... this is?

439
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:27,776
Next Conan, "Extreme Car Stunt".

440
00:24:43,676 --> 00:24:46,175
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:46,176 --> 00:24:47,875
"Two cars."

442
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:50,075
This time next week, we will bring to you Masked Yaiba.

443
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:52,876
-Hey, come off it, no way. -Oh, I guess not after all?
