1
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:10,317
Shoots. It's already this late.

2
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,017
Shoots!

3
00:00:20,017 --> 00:00:21,217
He's not aware.

4
00:00:22,217 --> 00:00:23,317
Please make it!

5
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:31,217
What the?

6
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:35,816
What happened?

7
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:38,216
Are you... all right?

8
00:00:38,217 --> 00:00:41,816
-What? -I'm sure glad you're okay.

9
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:44,016
You were about to be crushed

10
00:00:44,017 --> 00:00:47,116
by that man who came falling from the roof, you know.

11
00:00:47,117 --> 00:00:48,517
What?

12
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,717
This man seems to be okay, too.

13
00:01:01,617 --> 00:01:03,816
That man called Mr. Sadao Fukurokoji.

14
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:05,916
I wonder why he fell?

15
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,316
What?

16
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,416
I think he tried to commit suicide.

17
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:11,516
Suicide?

18
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:15,116
He used to always say so at the pub.

19
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,916
Nothing ever works out for me.

20
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:20,516
I wanna hurry up and die.

21
00:01:20,517 --> 00:01:22,516
Like so.

22
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:25,116
I was going to be messed up in a suicide case.

23
00:01:25,117 --> 00:01:28,617
Bad luck used to follow me around from before.

24
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:33,417
Some people are like that, I guess.

25
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:38,516
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

26
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:40,716
Love and cases come from the same origin.

27
00:01:40,717 --> 00:01:42,616
Waiting to meet someone for a casual date.

28
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:44,516
The slightest difference determines destiny.

29
00:01:44,517 --> 00:01:46,116
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:47,916
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:50,117
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:31,785 --> 00:03:35,785
"The Moving Target."

33
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:43,288
It's an alleged suicide case.

34
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,988
So it's of no concern to the Detective Squad, right?

35
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,888
We'd like to go see the site, anyway.

36
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:52,688
After all, it happened on our turf.

37
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:54,089
Right!

38
00:03:56,089 --> 00:03:57,589
It's up ahead.

39
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,888
What?

40
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,689
Why is the investigation 1st division here?

41
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:05,788
It's that boy!

42
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:09,388
By the boy wearing glasses, you meant Conan after all.

43
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:10,888
Great timing.

44
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:12,888
I have something I'd like to ask you about last night.

45
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:15,388
So it wasn't a mere case of alleged suicide.

46
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:19,389
No. It was a holiday so all the doors were closed.

47
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,388
So, the only way to get up to the roof

48
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:24,288
was to use the emergency stairs.

49
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:25,388
But...

50
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:29,388
Mr. Fukurokoji was so wasted, he couldn't stand on his own.

51
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:31,688
He couldn't have possibly gone up the stairs then.

52
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,488
No, he couldn't have.

53
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:36,588
Somebody carried Mr. Fukurokoji who was wasted

54
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:40,589
up the stairs to the roof and pushed him over.

55
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:41,989
So...

56
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,989
It wasn't alleged suicide but homicide.

57
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:48,888
And the perp is thought to have run

58
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,088
into the crowd of spectators and fled, but...

59
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:54,989
I wonder if you witnessed any suspicious looking person?

60
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,888
I see.

61
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:00,988
May I go see the roof?

62
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:03,289
I may recall something.

63
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:07,588
It was from here, right?

64
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:09,488
We're right above.

65
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:11,688
There are traces of the railing have been wiped, too.

66
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:14,288
What? What do you mean?

67
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:18,289
That. It looks like the fence has been wiped clean, doesn't it?

68
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:20,788
Mr. Fukurokoji's clothes must've rubbed against it

69
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,588
when he was pushed over, right?

70
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:26,288
But why did the perp do something so troublesome

71
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:28,088
as to carry him up to the roof and drop him?

72
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:30,688
He tried to make it look like suicide, no?

73
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:34,088
If so, there are easier ways to do it, aren't there?

74
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:36,389
There are traces here, too.

75
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:42,689
Which means the perp initially was going to push him off from here.

76
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:45,788
But, because Mr. Fukurokoji resisted,

77
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:48,889
he consequently pushed him off from there.

78
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:52,889
I wonder if somebody so wasted could resist.

79
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:55,789
Inspector!

80
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,688
Mr. Fukurokoji says he was so wasted last night

81
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:02,888
that he doesn't remember a thing.

82
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:06,888
He also said that he's loser in a competitive society,

83
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:09,489
so he knows of no one who has a grudge against him.

84
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:13,888
However, it's a fact that he was almost killed.

85
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:17,789
We'll try and get clues on where Mr. Fukurokoji went last night.

86
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:21,888
The perp is sure to have made contact with him somewhere.

87
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,089
Yes, sir!

88
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:27,388
You don't seem convinced.

89
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:30,588
Yeah, something's...

90
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:31,589
That's him.

91
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:36,888
Oh, it's over here.

92
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:38,988
Here, over here.

93
00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:42,888
This is where I was about to get crushed.

94
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:45,088
I got it.

95
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:47,388
I understand that you're unlucky.

96
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:51,288
Were you telling your friend about how unlucky you are?

97
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:52,888
You're yesterday's...

98
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,188
He's Daisuke Yukigaya,

99
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:57,788
my friend that I'm really proud of.

100
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:00,288
No need to say such things to children.

101
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:02,788
I'll see you.

102
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,189
Bye.

103
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:09,489
He said he came nearby. So he came to visit me.

104
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,288
He's an efficient worker.

105
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:14,888
He's an athlete and is from a rich distinguished family.

106
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:17,188
He's confident in everything he does.

107
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:18,588
He entered the company at the same time I did,

108
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:20,888
but is very different from me.

109
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,889
He says he never experienced any type of failure up to this day.

110
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:29,088
Such perfect people exist.

111
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:32,288
I wonder about people who know no failure?

112
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:36,088
I guess it's okay if they can go through life that way forever.

113
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,288
Compared to him, I'm super unlucky, you see.

114
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:43,188
Last night too, only because you happened to pass by here.

115
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:45,188
I didn't just happen to pass by.

116
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:47,288
I was waiting for somebody.

117
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:50,189
I got a love letter from a woman I never met.

118
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:54,788
But maybe because there was such a fuss,

119
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:58,088
that person never came.

120
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:00,688
A person you don't know asked you to meet her?

121
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,788
She wrote to come in front of this building at 8:00.

122
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:06,988
So at first, I was waiting in front of the entrance.

123
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:09,389
But my wristwatch stopped.

124
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:13,788
The battery's dead?

125
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:16,088
What time is it now anyway?

126
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:19,088
I'm sure there was a clock over that side.

127
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:21,388
The time, the time.

128
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,388
I came here where I could see the clock,

129
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:27,588
that person came falling.

130
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:29,889
I'm really unlucky, don't you think?

131
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:40,288
First, over here.

132
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,988
The other place where the railing was wiped clean.

133
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,588
What's the matter, Conan?

134
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:48,288
Officer Takagi said that Mr. Fukurokoji resisted,

135
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:50,588
so the initial place where the perp wanted to push him over

136
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:54,589
was different from the actual place he was pushed over.

137
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:56,788
But there's another reason for it.

138
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:58,488
-What? -What is it?

139
00:08:58,489 --> 00:08:59,788
What?

140
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,089
It could be that his target moved.

141
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,488
The perp not only wanted to kill Mr. Fukurokoji,

142
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:12,288
but also wanted to make it look as if.

143
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:14,489
Mr. Komatsu just happened to get involved and kill them both.

144
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:19,188
He tried to kill both as if killing two birds with one stone?

145
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:21,588
If so, everything falls into place.

146
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:25,088
The perp luring Mr. Komatsu out here with a love letter

147
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:29,089
and carrying Mr. Fukurokoji up to the roof and pushing him over.

148
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:30,888
In other words, the perp is someone

149
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:34,889
who has a grudge against Mr. Fukurokoji as well as Mr. Komatsu.

150
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:38,888
Somebody hates you.

151
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:40,689
What? Me?

152
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:45,588
There's nobody who hates me.

153
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:49,188
Then, will you show us the love letter that you received?

154
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,189
What?

155
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,788
We never got anything like that,

156
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:55,089
so we want to see it.

157
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:02,588
I thought we could get a clue from it about the perp.

158
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:03,988
Even so...

159
00:10:03,989 --> 00:10:05,188
"I have always been attracted to you

160
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,988
because no matter how unlucky you are,

161
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:09,188
you have never gotten depressed.

162
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:11,188
Please accept my date.

163
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:13,288
I will be waiting for you at on the night of the 13th

164
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:16,288
at 8:00 in front of the Beika Daiichi Building.

165
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:18,888
From me, who is always secretly watching you.

166
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:20,788
Sincerely with love."

167
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:23,088
I wonder about you taking this letter seriously

168
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,588
and going to see her when it isn't even signed.

169
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:26,988
Right!

170
00:10:26,989 --> 00:10:30,989
No! I have a girlfriend although it's just one-sided love.

171
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:35,389
That's why I went to explain that to her.

172
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:38,788
More than that, this is what I don't understand.

173
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,888
"PS: Please make sure you bring this letter

174
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:44,588
when you come to see me."

175
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:45,788
I wonder why?

176
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:47,688
To get the letter back, right?

177
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,988
Because it's evidence.

178
00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:51,488
It's impossible to get it back.

179
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:53,088
Because if everything worked out as planned,

180
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:55,188
there would have been a commotion.

181
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:57,889
For what did the perp write something like this?

182
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:02,988
I'm starved. Let's go grab something to eat.

183
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:04,688
-What? -Okay!

184
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:06,788
Okay! Let's all go.

185
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:09,488
I can treat you to a kiddy plate.

186
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:11,888
He's not a bad person.

187
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:14,989
Still, there's someone that wanted to get rid of him.

188
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:18,589
It's that store.

189
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:23,188
Sakiko is great.

190
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:25,688
She's cheerful and energetic.

191
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:27,488
Is she the woman?

192
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:29,489
That you're one-sidedly in love with?

193
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:32,989
How'd you know?

194
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,788
That was good!

195
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:41,289
I'm full.

196
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:47,588
I come here every day for lunch.

197
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:49,588
It's close to my office, too.

198
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:52,488
What? Your office is near here, too?

199
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:54,988
That person called Yukigaya that we saw a while ago...

200
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:57,888
What about Yukigaya?

201
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:00,988
Come to think of it, he hasn't been coming recently.

202
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:04,989
He used to always eat lunch here before too, right?

203
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:10,889
I've got to go to the restroom.

204
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:17,588
I think you know something about it, Sakiko?

205
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:18,788
What?

206
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:20,488
You can tell?

207
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,088
What?

208
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:25,988
About two months ago, he asked me out for a date.

209
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:28,788
Mr. Yukigaya did, that is.

210
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,389
Why don't we go see a movie next Sunday?

211
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:36,088
But I refused

212
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,688
and since then he stopped coming completely.

213
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:42,388
Just because you refused to date him?

214
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:44,688
He felt uncomfortable.

215
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:47,188
But Mr. Yukigaya is awesome.

216
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:48,888
Yet why did you turn him down?

217
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:52,889
Because I don't care for a person like him who is super confident,

218
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:56,188
having an air of "I have everything."

219
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:58,788
I totally agree.

220
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:01,988
On the other hand, Komat-chan is great!

221
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,088
What?

222
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:06,088
He believes in God.

223
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:08,088
He says that if a chain of unlucky occurs,

224
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:12,088
one day something super good is bound to happen,

225
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:14,888
because God is not unfair.

226
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:18,889
He's wonderful for seriously believing something like this.

227
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:24,789
Oh no, I'll bring you desserts and drinks right away.

228
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:31,889
This is not one-sided love, but Sakiko likes Mr. Komatsu, too.

229
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:35,188
Everybody seems to know that, too.

230
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,388
The only one who isn't aware seems to be him.

231
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:41,888
Mr. Komatsu's really dense.

232
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:44,388
I've figured out who the perp is.

233
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:45,988
It's Yukigaya.

234
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:47,288
What?

235
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:51,289
He said that he visited Mr. Komatsu because he came nearby, right?

236
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:57,088
I can see if he came by after a long while.

237
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:00,188
But he comes around here every day too,

238
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:01,788
because his office is here, right?

239
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:04,888
It sure sounds unnatural.

240
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:08,188
He probably came to see Mr. Komatsu to find out

241
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:12,189
if anybody knew that he was responsible for the crime.

242
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,888
Besides, if he's the perp,

243
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:19,889
it's understandable that he'd ask Mr. Komatsu to bring the letter.

244
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:23,688
But the perp not only went after Mr. Komatsu's life,

245
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:26,488
but after Mr. Fukurokoji's life, too.

246
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:29,888
That's why the possibility is still only 50%.

247
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:31,388
If he comes up after the police investigation

248
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:34,688
now in process is finished then...

249
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:36,689
it'll be 100%.

250
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,883
Which means a suspicious man emerged from your questioning?

251
00:14:48,483 --> 00:14:50,382
Last night, Mr. Fukurokoji seems to

252
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:53,282
have been drinking alone in a pub,

253
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:56,982
saying that he wanted to die like always.

254
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:59,183
Eventually, a man came over to him.

255
00:15:00,183 --> 00:15:01,582
I wanna die.

256
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:05,082
Yes. I want to die already, too.

257
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,383
Right? Don't you agree?

258
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:12,082
Let's go for another drink.

259
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,682
Okay, one more!

260
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:17,282
The two left the pub.

261
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,382
The man seems to have been wearing worn out clothes

262
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:21,882
and had disheveled hair.

263
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:24,082
He doesn't sound like that man.

264
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,382
Wasn't he a tall man?

265
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,482
He was the athletic type.

266
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:31,382
You can't fake physique.

267
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:32,482
Right.

268
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:33,982
That does it.

269
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:37,983
But I think that person had nothing to do with this case.

270
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,782
Why not?

271
00:15:39,783 --> 00:15:42,782
When we confirmed with Mr. Fukurokoji...

272
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:44,382
Come to think of it,

273
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,282
I think I kicked it off well with somebody.

274
00:15:47,283 --> 00:15:50,382
But he was somebody I saw for the first time.

275
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,782
The first time?

276
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:53,082
Right.

277
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,282
I can see if they got in trouble, but...

278
00:15:56,283 --> 00:15:57,883
See you then, Conan.

279
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:02,382
It didn't come up to 100%, did it?

280
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:04,982
The physique was similar to his,

281
00:16:04,983 --> 00:16:06,782
but he has no motive.

282
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:08,582
Besides, they only met each other for the first time.

283
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,183
He's not our man.

284
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,282
I see.

285
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:16,382
The perp didn't go for killing two birds with one stone.

286
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,382
What do you mean? Because the fact is...

287
00:16:19,383 --> 00:16:22,582
Don't tell me you're thinking of something absurd?

288
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,882
Something absurd?

289
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,882
He would have no compunction in doing anything

290
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:28,883
being the way he is.

291
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:34,082
I heard you wanted to talk to me. What is it?

292
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,483
I brought them here because they asked me to.

293
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:39,482
What? Sakiko.

294
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:43,483
Mr. Yukigaya, you've never experienced failure, have you?

295
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,583
That's really something.

296
00:16:47,683 --> 00:16:49,782
I don't know if it means anything.

297
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:51,782
But being the type of person you are,

298
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:55,783
you must've been super shocked when you asked Sakiko for a date

299
00:16:55,883 --> 00:16:58,782
and she turned you down.

300
00:16:58,783 --> 00:17:01,382
What? Something like that happened?

301
00:17:01,383 --> 00:17:03,282
So what?

302
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:06,682
So, you schemed what you did this time.

303
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:08,482
Mr. Komatsu.

304
00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:10,582
It was Mr. Yukigaya.

305
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:14,482
He was the one who wrote that love letter

306
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:17,182
as well as pushed Mr. Fukurokoji down from here.

307
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:19,082
What?

308
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:23,082
You feigned being a woman and sent that letter out.

309
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,682
Then you took Mr. Fukurokoji

310
00:17:25,683 --> 00:17:27,882
who was wasted out from the pub last night

311
00:17:27,883 --> 00:17:30,382
and carried him up to this roof,

312
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:34,383
and dropped him towards Mr. Komatsu who you had also lured out here.

313
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:39,983
But consequently, you couldn't kill him like you wanted to.

314
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:44,082
He'd never do a thing like that.

315
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,282
And why would he want to...

316
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:48,182
For what?

317
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:52,183
What do I gain from killing Komatsu?

318
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:55,883
You wanted Sakiko to suffer a great blow.

319
00:17:57,683 --> 00:17:59,282
He hit the bull's eye.

320
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:01,282
Me?

321
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:03,482
If his plan worked out,

322
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:07,183
Mr. Fukurokoji as well as Mr. Komatsu wouldn't have made it.

323
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:12,582
I'm sure if Sakiko saw that letter,

324
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,682
she would've been shocked out of her wits.

325
00:18:15,683 --> 00:18:18,682
To think that he died an unfortunate death

326
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:21,582
just because he was seduced by a woman.

327
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,882
Excuse me! I know him!

328
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:27,282
Why, Komat-chan?

329
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:30,283
You're an idiot! Why?

330
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:36,683
You were going to watch her and snicker.

331
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,682
That in fact was your purpose, Mr. Yukigaya, right?

332
00:18:40,683 --> 00:18:44,683
That's why you had to have him bring the letter along no matter what.

333
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:49,183
Because it was the most important thing to cause her grief.

334
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:52,182
No.

335
00:18:52,183 --> 00:18:56,183
If I die holding a love letter that I received from a woman,

336
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:59,482
why would Sakiko...

337
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:01,583
It's about time you realize.

338
00:19:04,183 --> 00:19:05,583
What?

339
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:13,382
Is it because I turned you down when you asked me for a date?

340
00:19:13,383 --> 00:19:15,083
Just because of something like that?

341
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,482
I think he just couldn't forgive you for it.

342
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:23,483
Especially because he's a confident person who knows no failure.

343
00:19:23,683 --> 00:19:25,982
But wait.

344
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:29,182
Why did you want to kill Mr. Fukurokoji, too?

345
00:19:29,183 --> 00:19:31,482
There was no explanation for that.

346
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:33,882
Anybody would've been okay, right?

347
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:36,082
But, if you dropped a block or something,

348
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,682
the police would've taken it to be premeditated murder.

349
00:19:39,683 --> 00:19:42,783
Therefore, you had to drop a human.

350
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,482
Even the police wouldn't think that someone would use a human

351
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:50,182
as a murder weapon.

352
00:19:50,183 --> 00:19:51,482
A murder weapon?

353
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:55,483
Mr. Fukurokoji was dropped just to kill Mr. Komatsu.

354
00:19:56,783 --> 00:19:58,482
He was used as a human murder weapon.

355
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:00,682
What?

356
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:03,882
The person that you found to use

357
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:07,082
just for that night was Mr. Fukurokoji, right?

358
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,982
Since he used to always say he wanted to die,

359
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:11,182
even if you dropped him from the roof,

360
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:13,382
nobody would think it strange.

361
00:20:13,383 --> 00:20:15,983
They'd just think he finally committed suicide.

362
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:21,483
Life has no meaning to trash like that anyway.

363
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:26,083
Rather, it's unsightly for them to be living in this world.

364
00:20:26,283 --> 00:20:28,982
Yukigaya, you...

365
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:32,682
Mr. Yukigaya, I would like to ask you something.

366
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:34,282
It's over.

367
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:37,382
You said to come at 4:00 right, Conan?

368
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:39,782
Didn't I say 3:30?

369
00:20:39,783 --> 00:20:42,282
Rather, what's over?

370
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:45,982
It seems he confessed to the alleged murder of the two.

371
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:47,983
He said that he's the perp.

372
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:52,682
But without proof,

373
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:55,083
you can't possibly corner me.

374
00:20:56,783 --> 00:21:00,682
And since this perp is really efficient,

375
00:21:00,683 --> 00:21:04,382
he hasn't left any traces of damaging evidence anywhere.

376
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,183
Not really so, it seems?

377
00:21:07,383 --> 00:21:10,782
This is something that we got a hold of from the very start,

378
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,582
but had no subject to match it to.

379
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,182
Hair?

380
00:21:16,183 --> 00:21:19,582
It was on the button of Mr. Fukurokoji's jacket.

381
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,683
Most likely, back then.

382
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:28,083
Just in case, we'd like you to give us your hair.

383
00:21:29,183 --> 00:21:33,183
To think that I left evidence on a trash like that...

384
00:21:35,683 --> 00:21:38,282
Even if that were to be my hair,

385
00:21:38,283 --> 00:21:42,282
I have a million other ways to get away with it.

386
00:21:42,283 --> 00:21:46,282
But I'd never do something as unsightly as that.

387
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:48,582
Because it wouldn't be me

388
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,883
if the act doesn't end beautifully, too.

389
00:21:52,783 --> 00:21:54,482
You...

390
00:21:54,483 --> 00:21:56,583
What's with this guy anyway?

391
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:23,583
Komat-chan, what's this about a love letter from a woman?

392
00:23:23,883 --> 00:23:27,883
-Hey, Komat-chan, what's it about? -Misfortune turned into fortune?

393
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:30,782
Isn't it a windfall?

394
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:33,182
Turn everything to good.

395
00:23:33,183 --> 00:23:35,382
All things come to those who wait.

396
00:23:35,383 --> 00:23:38,082
Those who believe shall be saved.

397
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,982
So, God does exist after all.

398
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:42,383
I like you!

399
00:23:43,783 --> 00:23:46,982
"Next Episode" -What?

400
00:23:46,983 --> 00:23:48,982
Is it a case?

401
00:23:48,983 --> 00:23:51,082
Is the vacant lot up ahead?

402
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:54,482
No. We're headed for...

403
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:56,482
A locked room.

404
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:59,982
Just saying it gets me excited!

405
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:03,582
Okay! Detective Squad, off we go!

406
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,683
Yes, I got it, too!

407
00:24:06,483 --> 00:24:08,482
What?

408
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:09,882
Next Conan,

409
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:13,883
"Detective Squad's Locked Room Deduction Battle"
