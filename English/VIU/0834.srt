1
00:00:05,781 --> 00:00:07,581
Room 901, right?

2
00:00:07,581 --> 00:00:09,981
Yeah, the floor on the very top.

3
00:00:09,981 --> 00:00:13,581
You snuck into the car, didn't you, glasses kid?

4
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:16,681
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:18,081
Its okay, sonny.

6
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:20,581
Children are supposed to be active.

7
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:21,881
Be careful. Okay?

8
00:00:21,881 --> 00:00:22,881
Okay!

9
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:24,481
Hold it there, brat!

10
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:34,581
It must be beyond on the other side.

11
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:36,581
Geez, you're always.

12
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:37,981
This is not play, you know?

13
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:40,281
Die!

14
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:52,681
I did it.

15
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,681
Who are you?

16
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,081
Mr. Takarada?

17
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:07,881
Yeah. He asked for it.

18
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:09,681
Pops, call an ambulance.

19
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:11,381
Too late.

20
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:13,681
He's been dead for at least two hours.

21
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:15,581
He's been strangled to death.

22
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:18,181
Strangled?

23
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:19,181
What?

24
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:26,681
A canvas stained black with crime.

25
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:29,181
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

26
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:31,681
A mysterious case in which a person is killed twice.

27
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:33,881
Somebody, somewhere is lying!

28
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:35,481
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:37,481
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:39,781
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:24,404
"The Man Who Died Twice (Part 1)"

32
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:37,004
Yoichi Takarada?

33
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:40,304
"Yoichi Takarada (48)" -You mean that notorious loan shark?

34
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:44,504
According to Mr. Takarada's secretary, Haruyuki Shinkai,

35
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:48,904
"Haruyuki Shinkai (27)" -Mr. Takarada rented this room to write novels in.

36
00:03:48,904 --> 00:03:52,704
Come to think of it, he used to over indulge in publishing his own books.

37
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,104
And I heard that he enjoyed it too.

38
00:03:54,104 --> 00:03:56,904
Mr. Takarada confined himself to this room today too

39
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,904
to concentrate on writing, is that correct?

40
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:00,104
Yes.

41
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:02,204
He was in here alone from morning.

42
00:04:02,204 --> 00:04:05,504
I didn't know that he was such a rogue.

43
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,904
He asked you to come here, didn't he?

44
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:10,704
I've never met him before,

45
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:13,704
yet he suddenly called me before noon and asked me to come here.

46
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:17,004
He said he wanted to talk something over with me

47
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:18,804
because he got a warning of murder.

48
00:04:18,804 --> 00:04:20,704
He asked me to come at 3:00.

49
00:04:20,704 --> 00:04:23,504
But, when I got here at the appointed time...

50
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:26,704
The warning had already been executed.

51
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:29,004
This seems to be the warning note.

52
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:31,104
It was on the table.

53
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,404
"I will kill Yoichi Takarada" -He's preyed on countless people.

54
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:37,504
"Grudge. Hatred. Murder." -One of his victims must've sought revenge.

55
00:04:37,504 --> 00:04:40,104
When that was delivered to the house this morning,

56
00:04:40,104 --> 00:04:41,904
that's what I thought too.

57
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:45,904
I'd like to see them try it!

58
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:52,104
I didn't want his victim

59
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:55,404
to become a killer.

60
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:57,504
So before that,

61
00:04:57,504 --> 00:05:00,004
while the president was napping...

62
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:01,704
Die!

63
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,804
But, I was too late.

64
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:14,504
We'll be asking about the damage you did to the body later.

65
00:05:14,504 --> 00:05:17,304
More pressing right now is the murder that was committed.

66
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:20,304
Do you have any idea who the perpetrator might be?

67
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:23,004
There were too many victims who had a grudge against him.

68
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:26,804
But, is one of them really the murderer?

69
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:28,304
Just what do you mean by that?

70
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:29,304
Because...

71
00:05:29,304 --> 00:05:31,204
Inspector Megure.

72
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:33,604
Did you come up with anything, medical examiner?

73
00:05:33,604 --> 00:05:34,604
Yes.

74
00:05:34,604 --> 00:05:37,004
The perpetrator, after knocking the victim unconscious,

75
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,704
with a blunt object on the back of his head,

76
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:43,404
seems to have choked him using a rope or something.

77
00:05:43,404 --> 00:05:47,304
We believe he died approximately two hours before the body was found.

78
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:49,404
That would be around 1 pm.

79
00:05:49,404 --> 00:05:51,104
Inspector.

80
00:05:51,104 --> 00:05:54,404
He's the manager of this condominium.

81
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:57,504
He's says he saw a suspicious woman just around that time.

82
00:05:57,504 --> 00:05:58,804
What?

83
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:00,704
"Kinsaku Tomii (58)" -After eating lunch,

84
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:04,404
I came up to this floor to do my rounds.

85
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:06,904
Just then, from the direction of this room,

86
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:10,604
I saw a blonde that I never saw before come walking towards me.

87
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:15,204
I think it was just around 1 pm.

88
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:16,204
Inspector.

89
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:20,904
Does this woman look familiar?

90
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:25,704
She's wearing sunglasses so it's hard to tell.

91
00:06:25,704 --> 00:06:29,704
But that doesn't necessarily have to be a woman, right?

92
00:06:29,704 --> 00:06:32,804
The person could've tried to look like one too.

93
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:36,204
She's only seen leaving,

94
00:06:36,204 --> 00:06:38,204
so she could've secretly come in from the back door,

95
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:40,704
and since she was witnessed,

96
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:42,304
maybe she decided to leave from the front door on her way out.

97
00:06:42,304 --> 00:06:46,904
Didn't the president lock the door of his room?

98
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:51,904
Come to think of it, the president had a habit of chain locking the door.

99
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:54,904
Besides if he was concerned enough about the note

100
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:57,104
to call on Pops, a detective,

101
00:06:57,104 --> 00:07:00,404
he wouldn't let anyone suspicious into the room, would he?

102
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:04,804
Yeah, we haven't ruled out the fact that it could've been someone he knew.

103
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:06,004
I got it!

104
00:07:06,004 --> 00:07:09,504
His family has finished identifying his body.

105
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:12,104
His wife and younger brother are here, right?

106
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:13,104
Let's go see them.

107
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:20,104
"Mika Takarada (36)" -How should I go on living on my own from now on?

108
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:21,204
"Koji Takarada (42)" -Darn it.

109
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:25,004
Who'd do something like this to my precious older brother?

110
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:26,104
Mrs. Takarada.

111
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:30,504
Where were you at around 1 pm today?

112
00:07:30,504 --> 00:07:34,004
Are you suspecting me?

113
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:37,804
No. This is just the routine.

114
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:40,604
Of course they'll suspect you. Most naturally.

115
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:43,804
Because you'll have assets and insurance money come avalanching in.

116
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:47,504
Talk for yourself, you hated Takarada too!

117
00:07:47,504 --> 00:07:50,404
Where were you at around 1 pm?

118
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:54,404
I was at home organizing the storeroom because Takarada asked me to.

119
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:57,704
I see. What about you, Koji?

120
00:07:57,704 --> 00:08:01,504
I was out walking around Shinjuku.

121
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:05,504
Do you have people who can verify for you?

122
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:12,304
So I guess the answer's no.

123
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:13,804
Excuse me.

124
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:16,204
Mrs. Takarada's telling the truth!

125
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,404
What?

126
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:20,604
At a little after 2 pm when I left the house,

127
00:08:20,604 --> 00:08:22,504
I was in the study.

128
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:24,404
But at around 1 pm,

129
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,304
Mrs. Takarada was definitely in the storeroom.

130
00:08:27,304 --> 00:08:28,804
Shinkai.

131
00:08:28,804 --> 00:08:31,504
You're a lifesaver, thank you.

132
00:08:31,504 --> 00:08:32,604
No problem.

133
00:08:34,204 --> 00:08:35,504
Then...

134
00:08:35,504 --> 00:08:36,904
the only one left is.

135
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:39,104
Hey.

136
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:42,304
It's odd that you're narrowing it down to the family in the first place!

137
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:43,304
Excuse me.

138
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:46,704
Could I please ask you to continue this at the house?

139
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:51,904
All right.

140
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:54,104
Let's move places.

141
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:56,404
-Me too. -Yeah.

142
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:57,504
Officer Takagi.

143
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,604
I want you to investigate the other case.

144
00:09:00,604 --> 00:09:02,204
Yes, sir.

145
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:09,104
If only he had noticed that the president was dead...

146
00:09:09,104 --> 00:09:13,004
He wouldn't have had to commit the crime.

147
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:16,304
"The Metropolitan Police Department"

148
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:18,104
Making amends?

149
00:09:18,104 --> 00:09:19,304
Yes.

150
00:09:19,304 --> 00:09:23,504
I was naturally aware of President Takarada's unscrupulous practices.

151
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:25,804
But I convinced myself

152
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:28,904
that his victims were fools for allowing themselves to be preyed upon.

153
00:09:28,904 --> 00:09:30,804
But the other day,

154
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:34,004
one of them committed suicide

155
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:35,604
along with his entire family.

156
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:41,104
Their child, who died wasn't even a year old yet.

157
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:42,604
And at that time for the first time,

158
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:47,004
I blamed myself for playing a part in the president's evil deeds.

159
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:50,404
Then this morning, I got that warning note of murder.

160
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:53,404
I figured that the one who sent the note

161
00:09:53,404 --> 00:09:55,404
was in the same boat as the person

162
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:59,304
who took the life of his young child when committing suicide.

163
00:09:59,304 --> 00:10:00,704
That's why I...

164
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:04,204
You wanted to prevent him from committing a crime.

165
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:10,704
But why did you decide to kill Mr. Takarada yourself?

166
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:12,404
As long as the president is around,

167
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,804
new victims will keep on being created.

168
00:10:14,804 --> 00:10:17,104
So if I kill the president...

169
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:20,004
since I played a part in helping the president,

170
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:22,504
it would be a way to make amends.

171
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:25,004
But, I didn't make it in time.

172
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:27,904
That person had already committed the murder.

173
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:30,504
But the killer doesn't necessarily have to be

174
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,804
someone who was a victim of the president.

175
00:10:33,804 --> 00:10:37,304
Officer, do you really think that one of the family members did it?

176
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,704
I just mean that we can't say for now who did it yet...

177
00:10:42,804 --> 00:10:45,404
I hated my big brother?

178
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:48,004
No, I didn't, Inspector.

179
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:51,004
But, Mika mentioned earlier that.

180
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:54,204
Koji made a living deceiving people.

181
00:10:54,204 --> 00:10:57,204
Two years ago, when he failed in one of his attempts,

182
00:10:57,204 --> 00:11:00,104
he came crying to Takarada to help him clean up his mess,

183
00:11:00,104 --> 00:11:01,904
but was refused.

184
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:04,904
So he had no choice but to go into hiding.

185
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:07,804
So, you resented him for that.

186
00:11:07,804 --> 00:11:11,204
Yet he came here three days ago, asking us to take him in for a while.

187
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:15,004
And today, Takarada was killed.

188
00:11:15,004 --> 00:11:16,604
What's with you?

189
00:11:16,604 --> 00:11:18,704
Getting back at me for what I said earlier or what!

190
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:20,504
I'm just telling them the facts.

191
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:23,204
You're making it sound like I came home

192
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:25,104
so that I could kill big brother!

193
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:28,004
Officer.

194
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:31,204
I just coincidentally happened to come back.

195
00:11:31,204 --> 00:11:35,104
The one who killed big brother is one of the victims that he preyed on.

196
00:11:35,104 --> 00:11:37,604
For all I know, there are tons of them.

197
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:43,604
"Kyoko Kinoshita (40)" -Yes.

198
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:47,104
It seems to be true that a lot of people hated him.

199
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:50,904
Then, you must've received a lot of threatening notes too?

200
00:11:50,904 --> 00:11:54,004
Yes and besides...

201
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,704
Besides?

202
00:11:55,704 --> 00:11:57,004
What?

203
00:11:57,004 --> 00:11:58,804
What's odd?

204
00:11:58,804 --> 00:12:04,204
It seems that Mr. Takarada used to get a lot of threatening notes.

205
00:12:04,204 --> 00:12:06,304
The maid also mentioned that there was a time

206
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:09,204
when he was attacked with a knife too.

207
00:12:09,204 --> 00:12:12,204
But, he never seemed a least bit concerned, she said.

208
00:12:12,204 --> 00:12:14,504
Then, why did he decide

209
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:18,004
to call on you just this time, Pops?

210
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:23,404
More than that, he laughs it off in front of everyone at that time.

211
00:12:23,404 --> 00:12:27,104
Then he called you, right Pops?

212
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:30,304
I wonder if he had any special reason to do so?

213
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:32,104
I see!

214
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:36,704
Mr. Takarada knew who was trying to kill him.

215
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:38,304
That's why he deliberately laughed it off,

216
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:40,704
so the perpetrator would get his guard down.

217
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:44,104
Then he wanted me to investigate and nail the guy!

218
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:46,304
I see. What?

219
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:47,804
Which means...

220
00:12:49,304 --> 00:12:51,304
The perpetrator is a family member

221
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:54,804
and one of the three who were there at that time!

222
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:58,104
But, Pops, out of the three...

223
00:12:58,104 --> 00:13:01,804
Mr. Shinkai who stabbed Mr. Takarada

224
00:13:01,804 --> 00:13:04,604
without knowing that he was already strangled to death is ruled out.

225
00:13:04,604 --> 00:13:08,504
And if his wife Mika has an alibi...

226
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:10,304
Then the only one left is...

227
00:13:10,304 --> 00:13:13,004
Hey. Hold it there.

228
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:16,804
Yes, hello.

229
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:20,404
Yes...

230
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:21,604
Okay.

231
00:13:21,604 --> 00:13:25,504
They found fingerprints on the murder warning note.

232
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:28,804
Mr. Koji Takarada, your fingerprints!

233
00:13:28,804 --> 00:13:31,904
No way...

234
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:34,904
Kyoko, come here, will you?

235
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:37,204
Yes, ma'am, did you call?

236
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:41,104
Call my lawyer, Attorney Watari, and ask him to come here!

237
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:43,604
Tell him I'd like to discuss inheritance processes with him.

238
00:13:43,604 --> 00:13:48,004
And contact Beika Life Insurance too because I'm the beneficiary.

239
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:51,304
-Hurry! -Yes, ma'am.

240
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:52,704
It's only natural, right?

241
00:13:52,704 --> 00:13:57,004
Because we've found that he's the perpetrator and the case is closed.

242
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:01,304
No. We haven't concluded that yet.

243
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:05,404
I've been waiting all this time for this moment to come!

244
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:07,104
Now that it's over let me tell you.

245
00:14:07,104 --> 00:14:11,404
I only married Takarada for his money.

246
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:16,504
Since he was notorious, I was anticipating that he would die early...

247
00:14:16,504 --> 00:14:18,704
Thank you so much, Koji.

248
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,504
I feel dizzy.

249
00:14:23,504 --> 00:14:25,504
What's with her?

250
00:14:25,504 --> 00:14:27,504
At any rate, Koji,

251
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:32,704
to make it look like the murder was committed by someone

252
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:35,304
who hated Mr. Takarada you sent out the warning note,

253
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:38,504
and killed him to take revenge

254
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:40,704
for what he did to you two years ago.

255
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:42,204
I didn't kill him.

256
00:14:42,204 --> 00:14:44,704
I didn't write any note threatening to kill him either.

257
00:14:44,704 --> 00:14:47,204
But, your fingerprints are on it!

258
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:50,204
How strange.

259
00:14:50,204 --> 00:14:53,604
Why's he so composed?

260
00:14:53,604 --> 00:14:54,904
I see.

261
00:14:54,904 --> 00:14:56,004
Okay.

262
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:59,304
Let me know if anything comes up.

263
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:01,504
Excuse me. Officer?

264
00:15:01,504 --> 00:15:04,304
Is Koji a suspect too?

265
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:08,004
Yeah, although he seems to be denying it.

266
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:12,604
Officer! He's not the perpetrator.

267
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:14,404
He has an alibi!

268
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:15,704
What?

269
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:18,904
Hey, just what do you mean?

270
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:27,691
When Koji came to stay at the house,

271
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:30,691
I was instructed by the president to keep an eye on him

272
00:15:30,691 --> 00:15:35,991
because he didn't want to have to clean up after Koji again.

273
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:39,091
So, when Koji secretly left the house today,

274
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:41,191
I followed him.

275
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,891
Koji was at the roof of a department store

276
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:46,291
that was full of parents and children watching a hero show.

277
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,591
He seemed to be waiting for somebody..

278
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:52,891
Although I watched him for a while, nobody showed up,

279
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:56,891
so I figured he was stood up and started home.

280
00:15:56,891 --> 00:16:00,791
That was around a little before 1 pm to a little after 1:30 pm.

281
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,291
But you said that

282
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:06,191
you were at the Takarada residence at that time, didn't you?

283
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:09,091
That's because the police suspected Mrs. Takarada.

284
00:16:09,091 --> 00:16:10,991
That's why I decided to testify for her alibi

285
00:16:10,991 --> 00:16:12,791
and protect her on the spur of the moment.

286
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,391
What? You lied?

287
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,691
But now since Koji is suspected as being the perpetrator,

288
00:16:19,691 --> 00:16:21,991
I have no choice but to tell the truth.

289
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:23,191
As for Mrs. Takarada,

290
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:26,791
the house maid can verify her alibi for her.

291
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,891
I'm sorry that I lied.

292
00:16:28,891 --> 00:16:31,391
Oh, no!

293
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,491
Inspector! His story's been corroborated!

294
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:38,991
It's no mistake that the place was crowded with parents and children too!

295
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:40,491
Okay.

296
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:45,591
That secretary called Shinkai followed me?

297
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:49,791
He looked composed

298
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:53,091
because he knew he was being followed.

299
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:56,891
Mr. Shinkai was in fact, not Mika's alibi witness

300
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:00,091
but Koji's.

301
00:17:00,091 --> 00:17:02,491
Now the situation's reversed

302
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,891
because I've got somebody to prove my alibi

303
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,491
while you don't.

304
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,191
You've got nobody.

305
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:10,691
Excuse me.

306
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:11,791
Ms. Kinoshita.

307
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:15,891
You went to the hospital from noon and were not at home, correct?

308
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:17,691
That's correct.

309
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:20,291
I'm really sorry.

310
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,491
I'm fine.

311
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:24,291
Even without a witness to my alibi..

312
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,591
What?

313
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:28,191
If Koji's not the perpetrator,

314
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:31,691
what about the fingerprints on the murder warning note?

315
00:17:31,691 --> 00:17:33,691
It was probably contrived.

316
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:37,491
It was probably made by using a paper with Koji's fingerprints on it.

317
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:40,791
The real perpetrator did it to frame Koji up as the perpetrator.

318
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,291
Just who are you talking about?

319
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,791
I don't gain anything from killing my brother.

320
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,991
But as for you, you'll finally inherit the fortune soon.

321
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:55,591
The more so I wouldn't go out of my way to kill him, would I?

322
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:59,491
I already heard from his doctor that.

323
00:17:59,491 --> 00:18:01,091
From the doctor?

324
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:02,691
What did you hear?

325
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:07,591
Thank you very much.

326
00:18:08,691 --> 00:18:09,891
No mistake about it.

327
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:14,091
He had terminal cancer and only had six months to live.

328
00:18:14,091 --> 00:18:15,591
Which means...

329
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:17,791
Knowing that I would be inheriting a large inheritance

330
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,991
as well as insurance money by just waiting six months more,

331
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:25,691
why would I do something as stupid as to risk losing all of it?

332
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:32,791
I guess this is her final trump card but...

333
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:39,591
Thank you for your cooperation.

334
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:43,391
Hey, look at that?

335
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:49,791
So you went to the restroom and came back.

336
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,991
Then this wig and sunglasses were here?

337
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:58,191
Yeah. It was shoved inside with my things.

338
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:00,691
Maybe the perpetrator thought that this was a trash dump

339
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:02,191
and disposed of the stuff he used to disguise himself?

340
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,291
Yeah, no doubt about it!

341
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,591
Pardon me. Would it be okay for me to borrow this?

342
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:10,591
Yeah. But give it back to me later, okay?

343
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:13,491
Mrs. Mika Takarada.

344
00:19:13,491 --> 00:19:17,091
The hair sample that you provided us with...

345
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:22,291
It matched the hair that was found on the inside of the wig!

346
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,491
What? It can't be...

347
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:28,291
I know nothing about the wig.

348
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:32,191
So, there was a reason you couldn't wait for six months ahead.

349
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:37,191
It could be but that wig was disposed, right?

350
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:38,691
If the perpetrator were going to dispose of it,

351
00:19:38,691 --> 00:19:39,991
there are more inconspicuous ways to get rid of it..

352
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:41,591
You...

353
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:45,191
You've been waiting for a chance to kill brother, right?

354
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:48,691
And just then a convenient scapegoat

355
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:51,891
like me showed up.

356
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,291
That was scary!

357
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,991
You almost got away with framing me.

358
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:04,091
I was here at home at the time Takarada was killed!

359
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:06,191
Believe me officers!

360
00:20:06,191 --> 00:20:09,091
We'll hear you out at the station.

361
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:10,791
Please come with me.

362
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,891
Case closed. Let's head home too.

363
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:15,291
But, Pops...

364
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,191
Before that, I need to use the restroom.

365
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,391
I didn't do it...

366
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:23,291
I'm telling you it wasn't me!

367
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:28,991
She stayed married to Mr. Takarada for his money.

368
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:33,191
But when the perfect scapegoat to frame as the perpetrator,

369
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:35,991
Koji showed up she planned to kill her husband.

370
00:20:35,991 --> 00:20:38,291
She makes a murder warning note with Koji's fingerprints on it

371
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,191
by extracting them from a sheet of paper with his prints on it

372
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:41,891
and sent it over to the house.

373
00:20:41,891 --> 00:20:42,991
She then goes to the room at the condominium

374
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,391
and strangles Mr. Takarada to death,

375
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:46,591
Just in case she's witnessed by someone,

376
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:48,991
she flees wearing the wig and sunglasses she prepared as disguise.

377
00:20:48,991 --> 00:20:52,291
Then she disposed of them when she was done.

378
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,391
That is how it should turn out,

379
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:57,391
but everything seems so sloppy.

380
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:59,991
What? Is that Koji?

381
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:04,391
Yes. You're the only person I can ask about legal stuff, Attorney.

382
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:06,391
If a wife kills her husband,

383
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,791
she can't inherit his estate, can she?

384
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,891
In that case, the money goes to...

385
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:12,991
Oh no,

386
00:21:12,991 --> 00:21:17,391
he only had one younger brother as a family member.

387
00:21:17,391 --> 00:21:18,791
Don't tell me that...

388
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:22,491
I don't gain anything from killing my brother.

389
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:25,891
But, if he sets his sister-in-law up as the perpetrator,

390
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:28,191
he can have all the inheritance to himself.

391
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:29,291
If so...

392
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,191
"Kyoko" "Afternoon, Hospital"

393
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:35,491
Which means that Koji knew you were going to the hospital today?

394
00:21:35,491 --> 00:21:36,491
Yes.

395
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:39,991
Not only Koji, but I'm sure that everyone else knew too.

396
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:41,991
Because as soon as I got the appointment,

397
00:21:41,991 --> 00:21:42,991
I marked it on the calendar like this

398
00:21:42,991 --> 00:21:44,991
because I didn't want to inconvenience anybody.

399
00:21:44,991 --> 00:21:47,191
So, he knew after all.

400
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:51,191
That today, there would be zero witnesses to testify for an alibi.

401
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:53,491
What? Why what brings you here, Mrs. Takarada?

402
00:21:53,491 --> 00:21:54,791
It's all your fault!

403
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:59,191
You should've kept on lying about witnessing me and prove my alibi.

404
00:21:59,191 --> 00:22:00,391
Oh, no.

405
00:22:01,891 --> 00:22:04,091
What a disgusting wife she was.

406
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:06,591
But, things just don't work out that way.

407
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:10,391
If he planned to trick the police rather...

408
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:13,391
All of us, he...

409
00:22:17,091 --> 00:22:20,891
I'm not going to let you have it your way.

410
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:44,291
"Next Episode" -If one were to kill Mr. Takarada

411
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,891
and make it look as if Mrs. Takarada had killed him.

412
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:50,491
That's why he put it by that man.

413
00:23:50,491 --> 00:23:53,491
Just as would be expected of the famed detective, Mr. Mouri.

414
00:23:53,491 --> 00:23:57,491
We made a mistake to start with.

415
00:23:57,491 --> 00:23:59,791
We thought it was a crime committed by a member of the family

416
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,391
But Mr. Mouri...

417
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:05,191
It won't serve to support the killing.

418
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:12,391
