1
00:00:01,195 --> 00:00:04,695
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:04,695 --> 00:00:06,395
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:06,395 --> 00:00:09,095
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:13,095
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:16,595
Eisuke Hondo who searches for the whereabouts of his sister and father,

6
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:18,695
lands up at Haido Central Hospital

7
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:22,295
where the FBI was hiding the Organization member, Kir,

8
00:00:22,295 --> 00:00:25,195
"Rena Mizunashi, Kir" -commonly known as Rena Mizunashi.

9
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:26,895
"Jodie Starling" -We had tracked down Rikumichi Kusuda,

10
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:30,295
a member of the Organization sent to get Rena back.

11
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:32,695
But when he failed to report,

12
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:34,995
"Gin, Vodka" -Gin and the others finally make their move,

13
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:36,595
"Gin, Vodka" -and we are ruthlessly attacked by them.

14
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:38,895
"Vermouth."

15
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:40,695
"James Black" -During the uproar over the bombs

16
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:42,195
the Organization had planted,

17
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:45,395
"Camel Andre" -we execute a plan to move Rena Mizunashi.

18
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:47,595
Gin sees through our plan

19
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:51,595
and Rena Mizunashi is taken away by the Black Organization.

20
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:55,195
"Shuichi Akai" -However, it was a plan

21
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:57,795
that Mr. Akai and I had thought up.

22
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:02,495
Rena Mizunashi actually happens to be an agent of the CIA,

23
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,795
"Rena Mizunashi, Hidemi Hondo" -and also Eisuke's older sister, Hidemi.

24
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:08,595
Due to the bone-marrow surgery that he underwent when he was a child,

25
00:01:08,595 --> 00:01:11,595
his blood type had changed.

26
00:01:11,595 --> 00:01:13,995
We also found out that...

27
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:16,895
"Ethern Hondo" -Ethern Hondo being killed by Rena Mizunashi,

28
00:01:16,895 --> 00:01:19,095
was actually a one-man act carried out by Ethern himself

29
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:22,295
to save his daughter's life from the Organization.

30
00:01:25,295 --> 00:01:27,195
I hope you're not going to tell me

31
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:31,095
to go back to the Organization again.

32
00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:32,695
Of course.

33
00:01:32,695 --> 00:01:35,695
That's what I'm going to ask you to do.

34
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:51,495
Sizzling hot suspense.

35
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:53,995
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

36
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:55,595
The fight to get Rena Mizunashi has ended?

37
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:56,895
The suspect for a new incident...

38
00:01:56,895 --> 00:01:58,395
is a FBI agent.

39
00:01:58,395 --> 00:01:59,895
He sees through the one and only truth.

40
00:01:59,895 --> 00:02:01,595
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

41
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:03,595
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

42
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:33,523
"Red and Black Crash: Suspicion."

43
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,010
"Haido Central Hospital" -I see.

44
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,010
So, you deliberately gave Rena Mizunashi over to those guys.

45
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,210
You told her to sneak in there

46
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,210
and investigate all kinds of things about them as she had previously doing.

47
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,210
Yes.

48
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,310
Not as one who cooperates with the FBI,

49
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,310
but as a CIA agent.

50
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,810
Which means that the sound of you being struck

51
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,410
just before the Organization got her back

52
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,410
was also foul play?

53
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,310
Yes.

54
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,510
Mr. Akai told me to act like I had passed out after being struck

55
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,510
and to stop the car.

56
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,510
I didn't think that I was really going to be struck though.

57
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,010
I asked her to do so.

58
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,710
Because if by chance, you happened to be killed.

59
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,810
If there is no trace on your neck that you had been struck,

60
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,510
it would endanger the life of Rena Mizunashi.

61
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,010
True.

62
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,410
But...

63
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,810
If so, it wouldn't have hurt to tell us so!

64
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,010
Exactly.

65
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,410
You can't even tell how shocked and depressed we were

66
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,610
to find that she had been taken by them again.

67
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,610
That's exactly what we were after.

68
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,110
It's more than likely that

69
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,110
they had been monitoring the wireless of the FBI.

70
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,810
Unless we are genuinely disappointed about her being taken away,

71
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,310
they probably wouldn't have been convinced.

72
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,710
It had to be real, no acting.

73
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,210
But, I just can't figure how you could even think of returning her back

74
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,210
into the Organization as an agent of the CIA.

75
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,810
It's not like we plain returned her.

76
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,010
We told her that...

77
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,610
after we report the Organization's information to CIA headquarters,

78
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,910
we would report the same information to the FBI.

79
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,610
It... it's amazing that she agreed to something like that.

80
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,910
Yes.

81
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,810
Of course she came up with a request

82
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,910
that was equal to what we asked her to do.

83
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,710
The witness protection program?

84
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,910
You want us to apply that to your younger brother?

85
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,310
Yes.

86
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,310
I'll write to Ei-chan telling him

87
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,510
to obey the request.

88
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,110
You'll do that for me, won't you?

89
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,210
After all you're telling me to deliberately return to a place

90
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,210
where they suspect me of being a spy for the CIA.

91
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,410
Yeah.

92
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,910
I guarantee the FBI will take care of your younger brother.

93
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,210
And...

94
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,610
No matter what the reason maybe...

95
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,310
the mission of my father for CIA will be top priority.

96
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,810
So, please don't be offended

97
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,810
if it turns out to be inconvenient for the FBI.

98
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,810
Yes. I was just thinking of saying the same thing.

99
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,310
Right, sonny?

100
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,210
Yep.

101
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,110
Witness Protection Program...

102
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,510
I'm pretty sure it can be applied to him

103
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,610
because he knows the email address of the boss.

104
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,310
But I'm worried about the people in this hospital too!

105
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,510
Those guys will probably think that they all protected Rena Mizunashi here

106
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,110
in cooperation with the FBI.

107
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,210
We've got to do something.

108
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,610
It'll be fine.

109
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,310
-Huh? -I think it's about time that Rena Mizunashi is...

110
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,110
Don't do anything to that hospital?

111
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,210
Are you saying to leave the people that lent a hand to the FBI alone

112
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,710
without doing anything?

113
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,610
No. It looks like they didn't cooperate or anything.

114
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,210
It seems that the FBI lied saying that

115
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,210
I was Shuichi Akai's younger sister and hospitalized me.

116
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,810
But you're a popular announcer that everyone knows.

117
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,310
They had to say I resembled her a number of times.

118
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,710
If I were to be the announcer herself,

119
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,510
I'm sure the media would've made a big fuss over it too.

120
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,810
Of course I'm sure that the FBI was doing their best

121
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,310
to hide my whereabouts too.

122
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,010
What's up, Kir?

123
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,810
Why are you so hung up about that hospital?

124
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,910
Is there something to that place?

125
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,010
No.

126
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:27,910
It's just that I don't feel good about killing people

127
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,210
who gave me treatment for my wounds.

128
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:35,410
Besides, if that hospital was cooperating with the FBI,

129
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,810
as soon as they find out that you guys are coming to get me back,

130
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,110
I'm sure they would've taken some sort of measure toward it.

131
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,910
I guess we won't do anything for now,

132
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,610
with all due respect for you.

133
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,810
For now?

134
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,210
I don't like the idea.

135
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,510
Huh?

136
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,410
I can't believe that Akai would think up a plan

137
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,610
that would so simply get Kir back to us.

138
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,710
I'm sure he's still got something up his sleeve.

139
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,810
Come to think of it, we didn't get to kill him.

140
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,310
Right.

141
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,910
I was so sure that he would show up one way or another

142
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,310
when we went to get Kir back.

143
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,310
Maybe that's just the kind of man he was to begin with?

144
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:49,410
Oh, so that announcer called Rena Mizunashi was a CIA agent.

145
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,710
Yeah.

146
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,910
Thanks to her agreeing to go back into the Black Organization,

147
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,510
we're finally getting somewhere.

148
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,110
Which means we have a chance of crushing them.

149
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,510
Well. I guess you already know,

150
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,410
but don't make too light of the Organization.

151
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,710
Gin, in particular.

152
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,410
Yeah. I know.

153
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,710
I wonder if you really know.

154
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,810
Huh?

155
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,710
And that boy Eisuke...

156
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,410
did he say he was going to accept the Witness Protection Program?

157
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,610
No.

158
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,610
I heard that he doesn't want to.

159
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,810
Although it seems that the people of the FBI

160
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,010
are trying to explain it to him.

161
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,810
I would think so. I refused too.

162
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,810
Well, I guess it can't be helped

163
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,210
because it's a system in which your name

164
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,210
and citizenship are completely changed

165
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,310
and you end up being a totally different person.

166
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,810
The fact is...

167
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,110
I'm hoping that he would refuse just like you did

168
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,410
and work alongside me.

169
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,710
He maybe a klutz but he sure is sharp.

170
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,410
But, are sure he'll be okay?

171
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,610
Because unlike me, it seems that he'll go on his own

172
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,810
and do something reckless.

173
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,310
No need to worry.

174
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,010
For now, Jodie and Mr. Akai are always near him.

175
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,610
Oh, I'd sure like to meet

176
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,010
this man called Akai.

177
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,410
Huh? Why?

178
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,010
No matter what you maybe on the inside,

179
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,010
you outwardly look to be a first grader.

180
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,010
I'm really interested in him,

181
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,210
because despite you being a child,

182
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,310
this sharp FBI agent lends an ear to you.

183
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,010
Oh yeah...

184
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,410
What?

185
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,510
Is there any reason you can't introduce him to me?

186
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,810
Oh, no.

187
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,810
I couldn't possibly tell her.

188
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,010
Hey...

189
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,610
I can't possibly tell her that he's the guy that approached your sister,

190
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,810
so that he could sneak into the Organization,

191
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,210
became her lover

192
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,610
and as a result created a reason for them to kill her.

193
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,510
I'm sure she already knows what he looks like besides.

194
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,810
Don't tell me that...

195
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,910
Don't tell me that he's...

196
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,110
That he has Lolita complex

197
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,210
or something like that?

198
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,810
Huh? You mean I'm right?

199
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,010
Talk about stupid!

200
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,910
You guys are talking secrets, just the two of you again!

201
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,210
You just said stupid, didn't you?

202
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,510
Hey, I hope you weren't talking about me?

203
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,610
No, we weren't.

204
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,410
We were talking about the buffet we're headed for.

205
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,910
Right, we didn't say stupid,

206
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,210
but was wondering if they'd have stewed buttered clam.

207
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,210
Huh?

208
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,410
Stewed buttered clam?

209
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,610
Stewed buttered, what's that?

210
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,010
I never heard of that before!

211
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,710
Well... it's said to be very tasty.

212
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,410
That this especially is reputed to be a delicious dish

213
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,210
of the buffet in this hotel.

214
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,210
That's amazing!

215
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,110
There are so many dishes!

216
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,210
Yes, there sure are a lot to choose from!

217
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,410
You mean, this is really all-you-can-eat stuff?

218
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,510
Yeah. But don't over eat

219
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,910
and come down with a stomach ache, mind you.

220
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,110
-Everything looks so delicious! -I'm going to take a lot!

221
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,510
I'll take this, and this...

222
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,810
Doing something like this at times is good too, isn't it?

223
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,810
Yeah.

224
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,210
A police car? This hotel?

225
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,010
Officer Takagi!

226
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,210
Oh! Conan!

227
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,410
What? A homicide?

228
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,310
You mean at this hotel?

229
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,610
Quiet.

230
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,110
Since this has still not been made public.

231
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,710
And, who was killed?

232
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,310
The president of a foreign talent production company

233
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,810
that has an office on the 39th floor of this hotel.

234
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,210
The one who found him is his secretary

235
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,610
and she says that when she got back,

236
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,010
she found him smeared with blood sitting in his chair.

237
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,410
He's been shot in several places in the top part of his body.

238
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,810
According to his secretary,

239
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,310
the president had an appointment to meet a new talent,

240
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:43,110
so the suspicious one is that person.

241
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,110
It's a man that the president saw on the street and scouted,

242
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,310
but his secretary hasn't met him yet,

243
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,610
so she doesn't know what he looks like or what his name is.

244
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,910
What time did the secretary report this?

245
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,310
About two or three minutes ago.

246
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,210
The estimated time of the crime is one or two minutes before that.

247
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,710
I just happened to be doing some questioning nearby,

248
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,710
that's why I was able to come here right away.

249
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,710
How did you figure out the time he was murdered?

250
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,110
The secretary was in the warehouse two floors down

251
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,910
organizing some things.

252
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,610
About five minutes ago,

253
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,910
the president asked her to check on something for him,

254
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,210
and she called him a minute later to report what she found,

255
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,610
but she said she got the answer phone.

256
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,410
Which means that the killer may still be inside this hotel.

257
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,710
Huh? I think more than five minutes have passed

258
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,110
since it happened though.

259
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,110
But just look at that.

260
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,910
Out of the three elevators there are,

261
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,710
the second elevator is out of order and under maintenance,

262
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,410
and first elevator is moving,

263
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,510
but since everybody rides it,

264
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,210
it takes a while for it to come,

265
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,610
so I think it's constantly full of people

266
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,310
from the restaurant arcade on the top floor.

267
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,010
I see...

268
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,210
I guess you can't ride it if it's full.

269
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,310
Huh? Why not?

270
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,710
Because after you shoot a gun,

271
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,610
the smell of gun powder sticks on.

272
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,310
So, I guess the killer would avoid

273
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,910
getting on an elevator that's full.

274
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:09,110
Which means the killer went up five flights of stairs,

275
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,910
and is eating at the restaurant arcade on the top floor,

276
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,910
or is hiding in the restroom of that floor,

277
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,710
or is perspiring profusely and going down the stairs.

278
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,010
Either way, if the person speaks Japanese

279
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,410
and is a foreigner who is working as a talent,

280
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,910
it shouldn't be difficult to find the person, right?

281
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,583
"Sunouchi Foreign Talent Production."

282
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:45,483
Then, when you found President Sunouchi,

283
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:48,283
there was no one in this room?

284
00:14:48,283 --> 00:14:50,583
No, there wasn't.

285
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:55,583
And what did the president want you to check for him?

286
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,583
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -He asked me to pick out the files of the talents.

287
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,583
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -who were hired 10 years ago.

288
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,083
Since I finished doing so,

289
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,883
I called him to ask him if he wanted me to take them to him.

290
00:15:05,883 --> 00:15:08,683
But after many calls,

291
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:11,483
I just got the answer phone.

292
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:16,383
By the way, do you happen to have any idea who that new talent

293
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,183
that the president was going to meet today was?

294
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:21,883
No, until the president formally hires you,

295
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:25,083
he doesn't let anyone see you.

296
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,183
It was the same for me too.

297
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:29,883
Which means you're a talent too?

298
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:31,183
Yes.

299
00:15:31,183 --> 00:15:34,783
But, since I can't write Japanese,

300
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:38,983
he told me to work as his secretary and study for a while.

301
00:15:38,983 --> 00:15:41,683
But Kanji is so difficult

302
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:43,883
that I have all emails from the president

303
00:15:43,883 --> 00:15:45,783
written to me in English even now.

304
00:15:47,383 --> 00:15:48,783
But, without knowing what the culprit looks like

305
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:51,183
or not even knowing the name,

306
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,683
it's going to be pretty tough finding the culprit.

307
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:55,083
No! Inspector Megure!

308
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,683
Huh? Oh, Officer Takagi?

309
00:15:57,683 --> 00:16:00,083
Inspector! We've found two!

310
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,183
What?

311
00:16:01,183 --> 00:16:04,083
Both are suspicious foreigners who speak fluent Japanese.

312
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,983
Suspicious? What's suspicious about them?

313
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:07,983
Yes sir.

314
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:11,183
One of them was loitering around the restaurant

315
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:14,283
and the other was hiding in the toilet.

316
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,783
So, what makes them suspicious?

317
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:23,783
Conan said so.

318
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,883
Takagi.

319
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:28,683
Since there's only one elevator working right now,

320
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:32,383
any foreigner that is near the areas I just mentioned should be suspected.

321
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:34,383
Don't tell me you told him about the case

322
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:35,483
without permission again?

323
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:37,483
I'm sorry.

324
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:40,083
I guess I just did it out of habit.

325
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:42,783
But, all for the better!

326
00:16:42,783 --> 00:16:45,683
He was able to bring in suspects like them.

327
00:16:45,683 --> 00:16:47,183
It's nothing to complain about.

328
00:16:48,683 --> 00:16:50,083
Takagi.

329
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,883
I'm sorry.

330
00:16:51,883 --> 00:16:54,983
And were they the only two you found?

331
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:56,783
Oh, no.

332
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,783
Officer Chiba and the others are checking the stairs.

333
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:01,083
Inspector!

334
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,783
-How was it? -I found one more!

335
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:05,983
He's a pretty suspicious foreigner

336
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,783
who was perspiring profusely going down the stairs!

337
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:10,183
See! Come over here!

338
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:12,983
Oh, so like I've been saying you're mistaken.

339
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:15,083
Never mind, just hurry up and do as you're told!

340
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:22,283
Conan.

341
00:17:22,283 --> 00:17:23,983
Agent Camel?

342
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:25,883
Why...

343
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,783
Oh, right.

344
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:34,783
It's a secret to the Japanese police

345
00:17:34,783 --> 00:17:37,083
that he's here as an agent of the FBI.

346
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,583
But, why was he here at this hotel

347
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,983
which is the site of a crime?

348
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:44,583
And, why is he dressed in a jersey outfit?

349
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:51,083
So, there are three suspects.

350
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,083
"Toby Keynes, age 27" -Yes.

351
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,283
"Toby Keynes, age 27" -This is Mr. Toby Keynes who was loitering.

352
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:55,683
"Toby Keynes, age 27" -around the restaurant arcade on the top floor.

353
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:58,083
"Hal Buckner, age 28" -He's Mr. Hal Buckner.

354
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,883
"Hal Buckner, age 28" -who was hiding in the toilet on the same floor.

355
00:17:59,883 --> 00:18:02,683
"Andre Camel, age 27" -And this is Mr. Andre Camel.

356
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:04,983
"Andre Camel, age 27" -who was perspiring profusely going down the stairs.

357
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,583
Hey...

358
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,683
it sounds bad when you say I was loitering.

359
00:18:09,683 --> 00:18:13,183
I was just trying to decide where to eat.

360
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,683
I see you speak fluent Japanese.

361
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:20,883
Yeah, my father's American and my mother's Japanese.

362
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:23,683
That's why I'm working as a model,

363
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:26,083
because of my Caucasian looks.

364
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:31,083
Do you know the fashion magazine called Annnon?

365
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,283
I'm on the pages sometimes.

366
00:18:34,283 --> 00:18:35,883
Confirm it later, will you?

367
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:37,283
Yes, sir.

368
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,683
I'm...

369
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:43,983
It... it's not that I was hiding in the toilet either.

370
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:46,383
I was troubled about a student of mine, so...

371
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:47,383
A student?

372
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:49,483
Oh, I'm working as an English teacher

373
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:52,483
at a prep school near here.

374
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:56,283
I fell in love with one of the students there,

375
00:18:56,283 --> 00:18:57,383
so I was planning to call her over to the restaurant on the top floor

376
00:18:57,383 --> 00:18:59,883
and came here.

377
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:01,383
But, when the time came to call her,

378
00:19:01,383 --> 00:19:02,983
I couldn't think of what to say.

379
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:05,683
That's why when came out of the toilet, you're looking pale.

380
00:19:05,683 --> 00:19:06,883
Yes.

381
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:08,783
When I'm worried, I like to be alone.

382
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:15,183
Now, what were you doing

383
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:16,483
running down the stairs perspiring profusely?

384
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:20,183
Can't you tell? I was training.

385
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:22,683
The height and the length of the stairs in this hotel

386
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:25,583
is just great for training.

387
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,483
I can't afford getting out of shape, in the line of work I do.

388
00:19:30,183 --> 00:19:32,783
I used to come here in the past when I found the time.

389
00:19:32,783 --> 00:19:33,983
In the past?

390
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:34,983
Yes.

391
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:37,683
I found it when I came to Japan two years ago.

392
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:40,283
You know the juice that they have at the restaurant on the top floor.

393
00:19:40,283 --> 00:19:42,083
The special fruit juice.

394
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,483
I just couldn't forget how delicious it is to drink after training.

395
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:47,483
So, I had a glass today too.

396
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:52,483
So, what line of work are you in?

397
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,783
Huh?

398
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:58,383
If it's a job that requires you to keep in shape,

399
00:19:58,383 --> 00:19:59,383
are you a Pro Wrestler?

400
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:00,883
Oh, no...

401
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:03,883
There's only one reason you can't tell us about it.

402
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:08,483
That's because your job is killing.

403
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:10,083
What?

404
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,483
Hey...

405
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:13,183
You're keeping your body in shape,

406
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:17,183
so that you can swiftly corner your target.

407
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,683
I'm sure that the scratch on his face

408
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:20,883
is one that he got when his target fought back at him.

409
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:22,683
No, this scratch is...

410
00:20:22,683 --> 00:20:23,983
Not only your scratch.

411
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:26,983
But, we're saying that your face is...

412
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:29,483
one of a murderer.

413
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:32,583
Well, it's obvious that you're not a tourist, right?

414
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,083
I don't think anyone would train themselves

415
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,683
when on a trip.

416
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:41,483
Oh, but he is...

417
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:43,883
Hey, what's this? Do you know him?

418
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:46,683
-Huh? -Is it true, Conan?

419
00:20:46,683 --> 00:20:49,583
Don't tell me he's wanted internationally?

420
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,283
I just know he's a bad guy, right?

421
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,083
Yep, because a good person doesn't hide anything!

422
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,783
Oh, well, you see...

423
00:20:55,783 --> 00:20:58,083
It's just as the children say.

424
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:01,083
If you have nothing to feel guilty about, tell us, will you?

425
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,783
What kind of work do you do?

426
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,383
I've got no choice.

427
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:13,183
"Haido Central Hospital" -Huh?

428
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:14,983
Camel's being suspected

429
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,783
as one of the suspects of a murder case?

430
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:21,583
Yep, he seems to have been training on the stairs

431
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,483
where the murder occurred.

432
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,783
Training using the stairs of a hotel?

433
00:21:26,783 --> 00:21:29,983
I guess he would since he's a muscle training fanatic.

434
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:32,083
He did the same thing two years ago too.

435
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,783
Come to think of it,

436
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:36,383
it seems he came to Japan two years ago too.

437
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:38,183
Did something come up?

438
00:21:38,183 --> 00:21:40,783
No, nothing really.

439
00:21:40,783 --> 00:21:44,783
Never mind that, will you hurry and help him get out of trouble.

440
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:48,583
You're going to the hotel now, aren't you?

441
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,183
Yes.

442
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,383
Make sure that you don't give away the fact

443
00:21:51,383 --> 00:21:55,883
that the FBI are here in Japan for top-secret investigation.

444
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:57,683
Yes, sir. Of course.

445
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,683
Okay, Conan, I'll be right over.

446
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:02,383
Bye, see you later.

447
00:22:02,383 --> 00:22:04,083
Oh, Jodie.

448
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:07,883
Be careful.

449
00:22:09,783 --> 00:22:12,983
I have this bad feeling today.

450
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:16,683
Oh, it's Friday the 13th, right?

451
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:22,483
I don't really go for things like that.

452
00:22:23,783 --> 00:22:26,683
Really?

453
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,883
"Next Episode" -People who suspect

454
00:23:53,883 --> 00:23:56,283
and people who are suspected.

455
00:23:56,283 --> 00:23:58,083
In order to clear oneself of suspicion,

456
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,883
you have to prove your innocence

457
00:23:59,883 --> 00:24:02,283
by showing evidence of the truth,

458
00:24:02,283 --> 00:24:05,783
or keep on deceiving to the very end.

459
00:24:05,783 --> 00:24:09,383
The offensive and defensive battle between the Organization

460
00:24:09,383 --> 00:24:10,783
and the FBI revolving around Rena Mizunashi continue,

461
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:14,783
after her return to the Black Organization.

462
00:24:14,783 --> 00:24:17,783
Next on Detective Conan,

463
00:24:17,783 --> 00:24:21,683
"Red and Black Crash: Innocence."

464
00:24:37,483 --> 00:24:39,583
Next Conan's Hint:

465
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,583
English Pronunciation.

466
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,383
The movie will be released this Saturday.

467
00:24:43,383 --> 00:24:44,383
The title is...

468
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:46,983
"Youth Detective Squad: Full Score of Fear"
