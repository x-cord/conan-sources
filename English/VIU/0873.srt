1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:03,338
Invited by Heiji Hattori and Kazuha Toyama,

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:06,238
Ran and I came to Yadori Village in Shizuoka

3
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:09,739
to help unearth the buried treasures of Tokugawa.

4
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:12,539
However, that night...

5
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:14,939
It's bright outside.

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:17,039
What is it?

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,338
It's burning in front of the hotel!

8
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:22,439
-What? -What?

9
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:26,439
Who would do something like this?

10
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:28,839
It's Nue.

11
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:33,438
The Nue came along with the black smoke.

12
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,439
Idiot!

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,438
-A thing like that doesn't exist. -Heiji!

14
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:38,739
Look at that.

15
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:41,839
"Stay out, danger!"

16
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:55,938
As we pursued the monster even more, what we saw was...

17
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:57,039
Blood?

18
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,138
Isn't that Mr. Someji?

19
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:06,938
Is he passed out?

20
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:09,938
No, he already dead.

21
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,938
He's got claw marks on him

22
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,939
as if he were attacked by a beast.

23
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,538
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

24
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:25,038
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

25
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:28,038
So it was the Nue after all that made those huge lacerations.

26
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,438
It gives impetus to the mystery of the buried treasure.

27
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,938
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:33,038
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:35,539
His name is Detective Conan!

30
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:20,803
"Conan and Heiji's Nue Legend (Claw Traces Edition)"

31
00:03:24,768 --> 00:03:26,467
He was dead?

32
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:27,767
Mr. Someji?

33
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:29,267
Really?

34
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:34,667
Yeah, beyond the trees that are around the lake near this hotel.

35
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:38,668
He had a large claw mark on his back and was murdered.

36
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:43,467
"Fumie Masuko (46), Novelist" -Don't tell me that it was a claw mark

37
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:45,367
that looked to be one of a tiger's?

38
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:48,767
No, it was much larger.

39
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:51,468
Four claw marks about 10 cm apart.

40
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:55,167
You must be joking?

41
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,967
This is no joke.

42
00:03:57,968 --> 00:03:59,467
"Hajime Tsurumi (22), Journalist" -It's Nue.

43
00:03:59,468 --> 00:04:02,367
He was murdered by that huge beast.

44
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:03,467
After all, it's said that the Nue has paws

45
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:05,967
and legs like that of a tiger.

46
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:07,267
"Michiki Tanzawa (62)" -I thought it were the jars,

47
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:09,867
"Archaeologist" -but it was the beast after all.

48
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:11,067
What?

49
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:14,267
Oh, no, I was just talking to myself.

50
00:04:14,268 --> 00:04:15,667
The jars...

51
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:17,367
That's what he thought?

52
00:04:17,368 --> 00:04:19,667
And? Did you call the police?

53
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:21,967
Yes, I did.

54
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:23,767
They told us they couldn't come here right away

55
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:25,767
because this place is so remote.

56
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:29,967
But I wonder if the police can handle a monster like that?

57
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:31,667
Don't worry.

58
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:35,567
There's no way the monster's real.

59
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,667
That's some sort of a trick.

60
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:40,967
This burnt place smells of kerosene too.

61
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:44,867
But there were huge claw marks on the back of the corpse, right?

62
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:49,867
Mr. Someji was probably stabbed in the back by the perpetrator and fled,

63
00:04:49,868 --> 00:04:51,867
but collapsed from exhaustion,

64
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:55,767
after which the perpetrator made a long cut over the initial wound.

65
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:57,467
Then the perpetrator made three more cuts beside it

66
00:04:57,468 --> 00:05:00,767
to make it look as if the victim was attacked by the Nue.

67
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,567
And the person who could've done that

68
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,767
was the village head who summoned Mr. Someji out here but...

69
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:07,367
Oh, but...

70
00:05:07,368 --> 00:05:08,867
"Densuke Takekuma (58)" -The truth is, I was asked to invite everyone here

71
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:10,567
"Village head of Yadori Village" -by a stranger too.

72
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:13,167
In addition to the notebook I showed you at dinner,

73
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:15,567
I was sent some money and a message

74
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:18,167
stating that inviting the four of them,

75
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:19,467
it would rekindle the legend of the hidden treasure

76
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:21,167
and revitalize the village.

77
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:23,967
Letters addressed to all four people were also enclosed,

78
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:26,767
saying that if I mailed them out the four would surely come.

79
00:05:26,768 --> 00:05:29,467
There was another envelope

80
00:05:29,468 --> 00:05:31,267
inside the letter that I sent you, there?

81
00:05:31,268 --> 00:05:33,567
Yeah. A letter about the cave-in accident

82
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:36,067
that happened 16 years ago.

83
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:38,267
Well, that could also be some lie

84
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:40,467
that you made up on your own too, though?

85
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:42,467
It's no lie!

86
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,367
Even the hotel and rooms that you were to stay in

87
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:46,767
were designated.

88
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:48,168
Well, at any rate...

89
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:51,867
We'll hear you out after the police get here.

90
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:53,167
Until then,

91
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:56,867
you'll all have to stay put in your rooms.

92
00:05:56,868 --> 00:05:58,067
Right.

93
00:05:58,068 --> 00:06:01,367
Let me have all your cell phones that make sounds too.

94
00:06:01,368 --> 00:06:03,767
Because somebody could've been creating

95
00:06:03,768 --> 00:06:06,767
those eerie cries with his device.

96
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:08,867
Wait.

97
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,567
If just as the village head said,

98
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:14,667
that somebody had designated your rooms...

99
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:17,467
Maybe the rooms could be rigged?

100
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:18,967
Our room seems to be

101
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:23,667
the one that the foreigner who died from the cave-in used.

102
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:26,467
I'd like somebody to change rooms with us.

103
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:29,167
Is that true?

104
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:30,168
Yes.

105
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:34,767
The notebook he used to practice hiragana was in the drawer.

106
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:38,067
There seems have been other notebooks too, but...

107
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:39,867
My, how interesting.

108
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:42,767
Let me change rooms with you then.

109
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:44,367
No.

110
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:47,367
Let me stay in that room.

111
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:50,868
I don't want women to be scared.

112
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:55,267
Then, can I move to the room on the third floor?

113
00:06:55,268 --> 00:06:58,967
I don't mind, but stay in the room.

114
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:01,068
If you leave, I'll take you to be the perpetrator.

115
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:05,667
I see, I see.

116
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:08,967
From here all your rooms are in view.

117
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:11,467
If that monster should appears again,

118
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:13,167
we can all chase it away together.

119
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:16,067
Rather, why are you here with us, village head?

120
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,867
Stay put in your room.

121
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:21,167
Leave the rest to us.

122
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:23,667
No can do. Although I was asked to do so,

123
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:26,867
I'm the one who invited all of you over.

124
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:29,467
I must see that you all stay safe as the village head.

125
00:07:29,468 --> 00:07:33,567
Well... Then, will you tell me about it?

126
00:07:33,568 --> 00:07:35,067
Tell you what?

127
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:36,968
The reason why you invited the four people.

128
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:41,467
Wasn't it written in the letter from that somebody?

129
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:43,067
Yeah.

130
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:46,267
Mr. Michiki Tanzawa, the archaeologist

131
00:07:46,268 --> 00:07:47,467
is very knowledgeable

132
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,667
about the geological features of Shizuoka Prefecture here.

133
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:53,667
It seems he's inspected this area sometime in the past too.

134
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:55,167
He not only excavates ruins in Shizuoka Prefecture,

135
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:56,367
but does so nationwide.

136
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:58,267
Until several years ago,

137
00:07:58,268 --> 00:08:01,067
he was well-known as a commentator

138
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:04,067
for TV Specials having to do with ruins.

139
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:07,367
Well, but after he was suspected of excavating fake earthenware,

140
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:10,567
he stopped making public appearances.

141
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:13,367
Then, what about that lady novelist?

142
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,768
You don't know Fumie Masuko?

143
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:20,767
She's famous for writing bizarre novels in which monsters appear.

144
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:23,167
Because she writes such stories,

145
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:25,667
she's very knowledgeable about Japanese monster stories.

146
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:28,867
If she feels that the image is not right during dramas and such,

147
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:31,467
I hear there were times she'd have them change the location

148
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:33,967
or repaint the color of the house that is used.

149
00:08:33,968 --> 00:08:36,767
Since she graduated from an art university,

150
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:38,868
I can see that tends to be picky though.

151
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:44,267
That has nothing to do with the hidden treasures of Tokugawa.

152
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:46,567
In the letter it said, if the hidden treasures won't do,

153
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:50,367
revitalize the village using the Nue.

154
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:52,467
But...

155
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:55,867
The reportage writer isn't famous, is he?

156
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,567
That's right.

157
00:08:57,568 --> 00:09:00,467
The murdered victim, Mr. Yasukatsu Someji

158
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:02,367
was a historian knowledgeable

159
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:04,868
about the hidden treasures of Tokugawa.

160
00:09:06,468 --> 00:09:09,867
Mr. Hajime Tsurumi is a novice reportage writer

161
00:09:09,868 --> 00:09:11,567
who goes throughout the country pursuing monster stories.

162
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:13,767
That's all that was written about him in the letter.

163
00:09:13,768 --> 00:09:16,368
I don't know why he was invited either.

164
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:25,667
But, why weren't the survivors of the cave-in accident invited?

165
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:27,067
That way, you could've asked in more detail

166
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:29,067
about what happened back then, right?

167
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,467
That's because they seem to have disappeared

168
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:34,767
since that accident.

169
00:09:34,768 --> 00:09:37,167
We don't even know their names.

170
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:41,067
Then, why did you invite Heiji over?

171
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:44,667
The fact is, it was written in the letter

172
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,867
to call the renown detective, Kogoro Mouri,

173
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:50,767
but too much money was spent on renovating this hotel.

174
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:52,967
At first, we were thinking of inviting

175
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,067
Mr. Shinichi Kudo of Tokyo over,

176
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:56,467
but we couldn't get a hold of him.

177
00:09:56,468 --> 00:10:00,567
So we invited Mr. Hattori from Osaka.

178
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:04,067
Hey, you mean I came in place of Pops and you?

179
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:05,268
Sorry.

180
00:10:06,268 --> 00:10:08,167
Come to think of it, it said in the letter

181
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:12,167
that I could also bring my girlfriend with me,

182
00:10:12,168 --> 00:10:14,067
but was that also written in the letter

183
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:15,367
that you got from that somebody?

184
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:16,368
Yes.

185
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:18,967
In the letter it said to make sure

186
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:21,867
to call Mr. Mouri's daughter over too.

187
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:23,367
Because it would be more pleasing to the eye

188
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:25,067
to have young girls perform in the video

189
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:26,967
for revitalizing the village.

190
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:29,867
Well, I guess all is well.

191
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:33,667
And, the trees in front of the hotel...

192
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:37,267
why is only the one on the very left of the hotel a different species?

193
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:40,367
See. The other trees in front of the hotel

194
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:42,967
all have pointed tips

195
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:44,967
but only one of the trees is different, right?

196
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:49,468
I wonder I haven't been here for a while too.

197
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:53,867
What's this?

198
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:55,667
The burnt ruins of this stick.

199
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:57,768
Something that looks like a cloth is stuck to it.

200
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:01,767
Was something like this in front of the hotel?

201
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:02,867
Who knows?

202
00:11:02,868 --> 00:11:04,267
Hey!

203
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:06,267
You guys are making so much noise!

204
00:11:06,268 --> 00:11:07,967
I'm sorry.

205
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:11,267
I was thinking of taking a nap before the police got here.

206
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:14,967
But you guys are making so much noise that I can't sleep!

207
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:17,567
Doesn't bother me.

208
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:21,167
After all I'm only a novice reportage writer

209
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:23,367
who was invited among all of you famous people.

210
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:25,767
I've got to keep my antenna up to par without sleeping a wink

211
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,867
if I want to write a good reportage.

212
00:11:27,868 --> 00:11:32,168
Besides, who knows when that monster will show up again.

213
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:39,567
It's the cry again.

214
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:40,968
Where on earth is it coming from?

215
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,268
What?

216
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,467
What's with that fire?

217
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:46,668
Beats me. It broke out just like that.

218
00:11:55,168 --> 00:11:56,467
It's Nue.

219
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:59,568
That monster's come again.

220
00:12:09,303 --> 00:12:10,402
It's Nue.

221
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:13,603
That monster's come again.

222
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,802
What was that scream?

223
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:22,902
It sounded like Mr. Tanzawa upstairs.

224
00:12:22,903 --> 00:12:25,702
Which means it's the room where we originally were.

225
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,303
The room on the very left of the third floor.

226
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,199
Oh, hey.

227
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,300
You can't go in without a spare key.

228
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,399
Mr. Tanzawa! What's up?

229
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,099
Hey! Mr. Tanzawa?

230
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,499
Please move out of the way.

231
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,700
The key...

232
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,800
Mr. Tanzawa, I'm coming in.

233
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,300
No good, he's already dead.

234
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,499
Under his chin...

235
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,100
there are two red spots.

236
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,199
Was he bitten by a snake?

237
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,899
Is that the only spare key to this room?

238
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,699
Yes.

239
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,799
Which means this room is a locked room...

240
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,199
Hey. Don't tell me it really exists.

241
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,400
The monster called Nue.

242
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,199
Everyone, thank you so much for waiting.

243
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,699
I'm Sango Yokomizo

244
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,399
from Shizuoka Prefectural Police Department.

245
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,499
According to the report,

246
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,599
it seems that you witnessed a huge monster.

247
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,199
Now that I'm here, you'll all be fine.

248
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,799
I shall protect all of you from that monster.

249
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,299
Two people have already died, though.

250
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,599
Well, it's probably just some trick or something, though.

251
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,699
Will you tell me of the circumstances

252
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,600
when you witnessed that monster?

253
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,499
It cried an eerie neighing like cry

254
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,499
then we saw the grass in front of the hotel up in flames.

255
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,499
We all went outside

256
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,299
and saw from the other side of the wall...

257
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,299
It appeared on all fours.

258
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,300
A monster huge enough to reach the second floor window.

259
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,599
And?

260
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,899
Did you see a thin fishing line on top of that monster?

261
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,699
-We didn't see anything like that. -Yeah.

262
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,799
I see.

263
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,899
It in fact bit the sign board that was in front...

264
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,299
Pulled it out and took it away.

265
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,499
It pulled the sign board out and took it away?

266
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,499
Was that sign board about 30 cm?

267
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,699
This is that sign board!

268
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,399
"Stay out, danger!" -See the teeth marks here?

269
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,399
It sure is large, isn't it?

270
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,299
This sign board was on the ground

271
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,899
in the direction that the monster fled off to.

272
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,199
The blood that was dripping from the sign board

273
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,199
led all the way to the rim of the lake.

274
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,499
So we followed it...

275
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,199
And found historian Mr. Someji dead.

276
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,899
He had lacerations on his back that looked like claw marks.

277
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,499
Claw marks like that of a cat?

278
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,299
This is the picture we took of the corpse.

279
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,199
There's a space of about 10 cm between each claw mark, right?

280
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,899
It can't be a cat, right?

281
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,499
You're right.

282
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,899
That's why I told everybody to stay put in their rooms

283
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,399
until police got here.

284
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,099
Just in case, I had them give me their cell phones

285
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,899
because it can create sounds.

286
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,299
So, the village head, Heiji and I went outside

287
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,299
to stand guard around the area that the monster appeared.

288
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,199
Then we heard a neighing cry again,

289
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,699
then the fire that we just put out suddenly broke out again,

290
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,999
and the flames got larger and larger.

291
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,299
While we were all taken by surprise,

292
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,299
we heard the archaeologist Mr. Tanzawa

293
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,999
who was in the corner room of the third floor

294
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,399
groan a deadly groan and went over.

295
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,399
When we went over to his room,

296
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,899
we found him murdered in a locked room.

297
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,499
This time he had bite marks

298
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,099
that looked to be that of a snake's under his chin.

299
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,799
Come to think of it,

300
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,199
when that monster fled,

301
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,299
I happened to see its tail.

302
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,499
Yes, that's right.

303
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,399
It looked like a snake, didn't it?

304
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Yes.

305
00:16:14,401 --> 00:16:16,199
The tail, a snake?

306
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,999
I'm sure you've heard about it too, Inspector?

307
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,399
Possessing the head of a monkey,

308
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,699
body of a badger, paws and legs of a tiger

309
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,899
and the tail of a snake.

310
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,899
The story of a beast called Nue.

311
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,900
Nue?

312
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:30,999
The legendary monster that lets out an eerie cry

313
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,399
and appears along with black smoke.

314
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,699
Legendary?

315
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,299
Don't tell me you don't know about it?

316
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,299
Please calm down, will you?

317
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,899
You're all talking as if that monster has revived or something

318
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,999
but it actually existed here in this Kurogane Forest.

319
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,299
The beast called Nue.

320
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,799
-What? -What?

321
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,799
There was an eye-witness report 16 years ago too, wasn't there?

322
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,399
Of a Nue.

323
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,099
Yes.

324
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,599
A foreigner on the excavation team

325
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,599
was trapped in a cave-in

326
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,599
and wrote the word Nue before he died.

327
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,199
But I've already told them about that...

328
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,299
See, just like I said.

329
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,599
Nue's been hiding in this forest for 16 years!

330
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,099
Hey, Kudo.

331
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,199
This inspector is not much different

332
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,699
from the klutz at the Gunma Prefectural police.

333
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,099
You can say that again.

334
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,599
At any rate!

335
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,399
We, the police will protect all of you.

336
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,800
So please stay in in a room and wait till further notice.

337
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,199
I will contact my superiors to see

338
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,100
is we can mobilize the self-defense force.

339
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,499
I thought it was going to rain,

340
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,199
but it hasn't yet.

341
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,899
What?

342
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,899
Well, the second time the grass caught fire,

343
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,499
a raindrop fell on my cheek

344
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,399
along with a sizzling sound like

345
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,599
that of the cap of a carbonated drink being opened.

346
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,199
Carbonated drink?

347
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,399
It wasn't me.

348
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,999
I did ask for carbonated soda

349
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,199
so that I could make sizzling wine,

350
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,199
but if I poured it out the window,

351
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,699
the village head wouldn't have been the only one who got wet.

352
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,899
Besides, I wouldn't do something

353
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,899
as low-class as to drink near the window like him

354
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,999
Well, sorry I'm low-class

355
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,099
because I was abandoned by my parents when I was a kid.

356
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,799
I wasn't raised properly.

357
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,599
But, that water wasn't me either.

358
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,999
Because no matter how much I shook the coke from my room,

359
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,499
it wouldn't have reached the village head.

360
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,100
Heiji.

361
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,400
Look.

362
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,099
There are small round clumps all over the grass.

363
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Hey!

364
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:55,899
If this is what I think it is,

365
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,299
no match or lighter would've been needed to...

366
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,299
Light a fire, right?

367
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,099
If so, all we need to figure out now

368
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,799
is the trick of that humongous monster...

369
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,900
And the poisoning in the locked room.

370
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,599
First of all, the locked room.

371
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,499
Mr. Tanzawa who was poisoned to death

372
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,499
moved into the room at the very left on the third floor

373
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,299
where we originally were, right?

374
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,399
Yeah.

375
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,099
Based on the position of the rooms,

376
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,599
the most suspicious would be

377
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,099
Ms. Masuko who was right below him

378
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,799
because if Mr. Tanzawa who was surprised by the fire,

379
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,999
stuck his head out of the window,

380
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,899
she could've used a long stick with a poisoned needle on the tip

381
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,700
and struck him with it, right?

382
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,299
Since for some reason,

383
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,799
only one side of the window would open in that room,

384
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,399
she could've have known beforehand

385
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,299
where Mr. Tanazawa would stick his face out.

386
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,699
But when we went to get Ms. Masuko's cell phone,

387
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,999
she let us check her room,

388
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,699
but there was no stick or the like inside.

389
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,799
Yeah.

390
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,499
The only objects of interest were...

391
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,199
the two 1L bottles of carbonated soda,

392
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,899
a bottle of white wine, a wine glass,

393
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,399
and a sommelier knife that she asked the village head for.

394
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,999
As well as a ball pen and stationery

395
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,299
that she had in her bag together with paper tape,

396
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,899
a sewing set and a notebook.

397
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,099
Then, how about that reportage writer?

398
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,699
When Mr. Tanzawa moved to our room,

399
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,699
he also moved to the room next door on the third floor.

400
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,399
Maybe only one side of the window of the room opened

401
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,599
so that it wouldn't block the writer

402
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,199
from blowing a poisoned blow dart at Mr. Tanzawa.

403
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,699
But, the windows of both rooms

404
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:44,199
were about 10 m apart with one window between them,

405
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,199
and he couldn't have shot Mr. Tanazawa under the chin from the side.

406
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,699
Besides, Mr. Tsurumi didn't have a blowpipe.

407
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,299
Right.

408
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,799
The things we found in his room were...

409
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,299
three 500 ml PET bottles of coke,

410
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,399
two bags of potato chips,

411
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,699
a folded knife, a selfie stick,

412
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,899
cigarettes and a lighter

413
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,299
and a plastic model kit that he said he bought to kill time.

414
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,399
He went out of his way to buy himself some glue too.

415
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,499
Well, he didn't have anything

416
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,399
that he could've used to poison someone.

417
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,899
The only one left, is the village head but...

418
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,100
The only thing he had was a deck brush.

419
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,299
What're you guys doing there?

420
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,899
Weren't you told to stay put in your rooms?

421
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,399
But, we were worried about the doggie.

422
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,499
When the Nue cried a while ago,

423
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,899
the dog barked and we heard it scratching the wall.

424
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,499
We thought that maybe it was hungry and wanted to leave the room.

425
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,799
So, we made it some dog food in the kitchen and brought it over but...

426
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,900
It wouldn't eat at all.

427
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,699
Now that you mentioned it, the first time the Nue cried...

428
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,700
The dog barked.

429
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,099
But when that monster appeared...

430
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,800
It didn't bark!

431
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,899
So, that's what it was.

432
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,799
I'm beginning to see the picture.

433
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,399
And, the only one who could've carried this out is...

434
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,700
None other than...

436
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,799
That beast out one more time.

437
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,700
That's impossible...

438
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,599
This is...

439
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,500
the cry of the Nue.

440
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,099
Heiji, where are you?

441
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,699
Help!
