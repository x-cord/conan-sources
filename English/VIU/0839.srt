1
00:00:01,781 --> 00:00:04,481
That's in the opposite direction.

2
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:07,181
Oh my God. What we are going to do?

3
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:10,081
We could head back but the sun's about to set.

4
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:13,381
Is there any place nearby where we can spend the night?

5
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,581
"Shozo Shimomura (62)" -There's a Japanese inn

6
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,981
"Local historian" -at the foot of the mountain.

7
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:18,881
Let's go spend the night there.

8
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:20,981
Thank you so very much.

9
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:22,381
Not at all.

10
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:28,581
What's that sound?

11
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:30,581
It's the voice of Tengu (a long-nosed goblin).

12
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:34,981
A canvas stained black with crime.

13
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:37,381
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

14
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:39,581
Everyone also hears the creepy groan.

15
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,881
The secret of the long-nosed goblin opens the curtains to the case.

16
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:43,581
He sees through the one and only truth.

17

A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

"Voice of Tengu (a long-nosed goblin)"

20
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:37,972
How beautiful.

21
00:02:40,372 --> 00:02:42,772
Where's the money coming from?

22
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:44,672
What're you talking about?

23
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:46,572
"Shigeo Imazu (51)" -I'm talking about the money

24
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:48,072

27
00:02:56,372 --> 00:02:58,072
I'd like to see you try!

28
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:06,172
What a loser.

29
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,572
Well, that sure was a nice bath.

30
00:03:11,572 --> 00:03:12,572
You can say that again.

31
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:14,472
I'm hungry.

32
00:03:14,472 --> 00:03:17,272
That's him. Thank you for earlier.

33
00:03:17,272 --> 00:03:19,172
Not at all.

34
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:22,972
Oh, Sensei, this way please.

35
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:23,972
Yeah.

"Mr. Shimomura Publishing Party"

So he's a novelist.

38
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:37,872
Sensei, could you give a comment?

39
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:43,872
9.50am, huh?

40
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:46,672
There's one hour to go before the bus comes.

41
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:50,272
Dad, Conan, they say there's a cave nearby.

42
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,672
Would you like to go see it?

43
00:03:51,672 --> 00:03:53,972
I guess so. We've got nothing else to so anyway.

44
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:56,672
"Kokushu Historical Site: Welcome to the Tengu Cave"

45
00:03:56,672 --> 00:04:00,472
We were lucky that the inn let our leave our baggage there.

46
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:02,572
Oh! I think it's over there.

47
00:04:02,572 --> 00:04:04,972
Let's see.

48
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:09,372
What was that?

49
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:11,772
Sorry.

00:04:11,772 --> 00:04:13,272
It's fine.

51
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:17,772
I wonder what he was doing there.

52
00:04:17,772 --> 00:04:19,572
It's closed.

53
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:20,572
What?

54
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:24,772
Oh, I'm sorry.

55
00:04:24,772 --> 00:04:26,172

Okay.

60
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,172
What?

61
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:51,472
What's the matter?

62
00:04:51,472 --> 00:04:53,372
The mask is gone.

63
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:57,872
Is this what the inside looks like?

64
00:04:57,872 --> 00:05:00,672
Yes. It's for the people who can't go all the way inside

65
00:05:00,672 --> 00:05:02,472
because the corridor is narrow.

66
00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:04,872
Take a look, Conan.

67
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:07,872
There's a small shrine part way through the cliff.

68
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,372
That's called the shrine of Tengu.

69
00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:11,272
Huh? What is that?

70
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:12,972
This!

71
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:16,872
He's hanging from the neck?

72
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:18,072
What?

73
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:21,572
Oh no!

74
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:23,772
Oh, it fell!

75
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:24,972
Let's hurry inside!

76
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:31,172
Please watch your head.

77
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:33,272
Are you all right, Dad?

78
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:37,372
It sure is narrow here.

79
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:41,172
We're outside.

80
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:42,972
That way!

81
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:01,872
Mayor!

82
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:04,372
There's no pulse. He's dead.

83
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:06,672
Ran, call the police.

84
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:09,672
This area is out of service range.

85
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:11,472
You've got to go back to the inn.

86
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:12,972
Okay.

87
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:25,572
This is probably what happened.

88
00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:28,472
The mayor put a rope around the shrine and hung himself,

89
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:32,172
but unable to withstand the weight, it broke.

90
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:36,372
But, why did he choose a high place like that?

91
00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:38,172
What's this?

92
00:06:39,072 --> 00:06:40,572
It's a scaffold.

93
00:06:42,472 --> 00:06:46,072
We could go right below the shrine before.

94
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,172
But now it's been disassembled.

95
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:52,272
When I came here yesterday in the morning, it was here.

96
00:06:52,272 --> 00:06:54,272
I wonder who disassembled it.

97
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:58,372
Can you climb up without a scaffold?

98
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:01,672
There!

99
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:09,872
No good. I can't climb it at all.

100
00:07:10,772 --> 00:07:12,972
There's a trick to it.

101
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:16,072
Shimomura Sensei!

102
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:20,372
So, we meet again.

103
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:24,572
Even if there's a trick to it, this cliff is...

104
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:26,472
This is...

105
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:29,372
He's the mayor. He's dead.

106
00:07:31,972 --> 00:07:33,972
Speaking of this cliff, Mr. Hirai,

107
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:37,572
you boys used to climb up all time, didn't you?

108
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:41,172
Yes. You always scolded us for it.

109
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:43,972
Why's he called Sensei?

110
00:07:43,972 --> 00:07:47,872
He's a school teacher. The principal of a school.

111
00:07:47,872 --> 00:07:50,772
After retiring two years ago,

112
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:54,272
he's been continuing his life's work of researching Tengu.

113
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:57,272
Then, the book you published was also about Tengu?

114
00:07:57,272 --> 00:08:00,572
My former students paid for it.

115
00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:03,172
They even had a party for me last night too.

116
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:04,872
I'm really grateful for their support.

117
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:10,772
Are the mayor and Mr. Imazu also former students?

118
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:14,072
That's right. Although they were in different grades.

119
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:17,572
There it is again.

120
00:08:17,572 --> 00:08:20,972
That voice of Tengu, what is it actually?

121
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:23,772
I wonder what it is.

122
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,372
Mayama?

123
00:08:31,672 --> 00:08:33,372
Who is he?

124
00:08:33,372 --> 00:08:34,972
Mr. Imazu.

125
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:38,272
He used to be the mayor until he was beaten by Mr. Mayama

126
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:40,172
in the last mayoral election.

127
00:08:40,172 --> 00:08:44,772
Oh. Mr. Imazu, could I ask you a few questions?

128
00:08:44,772 --> 00:08:46,872
Who's asking?

129
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:48,672
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

130
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:49,872
A detective.

131
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:54,472
How long were you in front of the cave?

132
00:08:55,272 --> 00:08:57,372
From around 8.30am.

133
00:08:57,372 --> 00:09:00,072
Did you see Mr. Mayama come?

134
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,072
Yeah.

135
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:03,272
He came at around 9am.

136
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:04,472
Was he alone?

137
00:09:04,472 --> 00:09:05,672
Right.

138
00:09:05,672 --> 00:09:10,372
By the way, should I tell you why I was in front of the cave?

139
00:09:10,372 --> 00:09:11,772
Yes, please.

140
00:09:12,772 --> 00:09:14,572
Last night.

141
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:18,572
Are you blackmailing me?

142
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:20,572
How much do you want?

143
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:23,172
All right. And, where should I meet you?

144
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:25,672
Tomorrow morning at 9am, at the Tengu Cave.

145
00:09:25,672 --> 00:09:27,272
I got it.

146
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:28,972
I'm just assuming

147
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:31,372
but I think he was being blackmailed over off the books money he received

148
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:33,472
during the election.

149
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:37,072
That's why I was staking out in front of the cave.

150
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:49,572
However, he didn't come out no matter how long I waited.

151
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:51,772
I was trying to decide what to do

152
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:53,972
when I ran into all of you.

153
00:09:53,972 --> 00:09:57,472
Did anyone else enter the cave during that time?

154
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,472
Nobody.

155
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,072
-Mr. Imazu. -What?

156
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:03,772
You're a building contractor, aren't you?

157
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:07,672
Are you the one who disassembled the scaffold?

158
00:10:07,672 --> 00:10:08,772
That's right.

159
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:10,872
When did you take it apart?

160
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:12,172
Yesterday afternoon.

161
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:15,472
When Mr. Mayama called me and told me to do so.

162
00:10:15,472 --> 00:10:17,272
That's strange.

163
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:19,272
If he was planning to hang himself by the shrine,

164
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:21,772
it would've been easier to leave the scaffoldings up.

165
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:24,372
Why did he do it the day after it was taken down?

166
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:25,872
I don't think he planned it

167
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:28,472
but impulsively thought of committing suicide.

168
00:10:28,472 --> 00:10:31,572
No, no, it was planned.

169
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:35,472
Because he got ready the rope to hang himself with.

170
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:37,872
In other words, it's like this.

171
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:41,572
At 9 in the morning, unaware that Mr. Imazu was watching him,

172
00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:45,072
Mr. Mayama entered the cave alone.

173
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:47,272
After entering the cave, he locked it from the inside

174
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,472
and stole the mask of Tengu that was in the office.

175
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:52,372
He then, climbed up the cliff,

176
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:55,472
tied the rope that he brought along to the pillar of the shrine

177
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:57,072
and hung himself.

178
00:10:58,272 --> 00:11:00,972
What about the blackmailer?

179
00:11:00,972 --> 00:11:02,972
He didn't come, then?

180
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:04,472
He probably did come,

181
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:08,672
but saw Mr. Imazu standing outside and decided to leave.

182
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:09,872
I see.

183
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:13,272
All we need to figure out now is the motive.

184
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,972
Do you have any idea?

185
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:25,372
Huh?

186
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,072
What else?

187
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:35,772
Death spots?

188
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:40,172
It's odd. If he hung himself, they should appear on his legs.

189
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:41,572
Which means...

190
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:46,772
This is not suicide!

191
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:55,152
I wonder when the killer went into the cave and left.

192
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:58,552
There's no guarantee that Mr. Imazu is telling the truth,

193
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,352
or he could've just carelessly overlooked something.

194
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:05,852
But, it's a fact that when we came the door was locked.

195
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:13,152
I'll try going up then.

196
00:12:20,052 --> 00:12:22,152
Hey, Conan, it's dangerous!

197
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:23,752
I'll be fine. Don't worry!

198
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:42,652
5 minutes.

199
00:12:47,552 --> 00:12:50,252
This is the place we met Mr. Shimomura yesterday.

200
00:12:53,552 --> 00:12:55,452
That's why we heard the voice of Tengu.

201
00:12:56,252 --> 00:12:59,552
He probably thought that he couldn't escape from the blackmailer.

202
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:01,252
That's the kind of guy he was.

203
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:04,352
When things started going south, he'd flee.

204
00:13:04,352 --> 00:13:05,452
He's right.

205
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,552
No, that's not true.

206
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:10,852
His conscious bothered him.

207
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:15,352
The Kurama Tengu is a symbol of torturing evil.

208
00:13:15,352 --> 00:13:16,952
Maybe that was the message he was trying to convey

209
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:20,052
by wearing the Tengu mask.

210
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:21,852
It was fortunate that his body swayed.

211
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:23,552
If it fell straight down,

212
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,252
the corpse would've suffered extensive damage.

213
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:27,252
Huh?

214
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:31,552
Why did he sway?

215
00:13:31,552 --> 00:13:33,752
It was probably the wind, but...

216
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:40,052
I wonder if we can really go through such a narrow place.

217
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,852
Yes, you can. Watch your head.

218
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:48,552
I believe that the call from the blackmailer

219
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:51,452
as well as Mr. Shimomura's publishing party

220
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:54,452
triggered this incident.

221
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:55,752
I see.

222
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,052
I found it.

223
00:14:18,952 --> 00:14:22,352
So then the case is closed.

224
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:27,752
Dad!

225
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:32,952
This is what I'd like to say,

226
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:35,352
but we'd just be playing into the killer's hands.

227
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:36,352
What?

228
00:14:36,352 --> 00:14:38,552
Please check the back of the victim.

229
00:14:38,552 --> 00:14:40,752
You'll see death spots.

230
00:14:42,352 --> 00:14:44,352
You're right.

231
00:14:44,352 --> 00:14:46,852
If he hung himself, his death spots would appear on his legs.

232
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,852
They appeared on his back because he was lying on his back.

233
00:14:49,852 --> 00:14:54,052
Which means he was killed lying on his back then hung?

234
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:55,752
That's impossible.

235
00:14:55,752 --> 00:14:59,352
How did the killer carry the corpse to a place that high?

236
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:00,452
I guess so.

237
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:03,352
Even if it were done, there's no merit in doing something like that.

238
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:04,352
Mr. Hirai.

239
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:05,352
Yes, sir.

240
00:15:05,352 --> 00:15:09,352
Please try to recall what you saw back then on the monitor.

241
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:10,752
I saw,

242
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:14,852
the mayor hanging.

243
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:17,452
He was hung and what situation was he in?

244
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:19,352
He was swaying.

245
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:23,652
He was swaying so he didn't crash onto the scaffold.

246
00:15:23,652 --> 00:15:25,552
He's got to be thankful to the wind.

247
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:27,052
Was it the wind?

248
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,152
On the monitor, water from a hot spring

249
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:31,352
was on display in the foreground.

250
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:35,352
The hot spring water was flowing just like it is now.

251
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:38,452
Maybe it swayed because it was right after he hung himself?

252
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:40,552
If he struggles, he'd sway, right?

253
00:15:40,552 --> 00:15:42,152
Judging from the death spots,

254
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:44,252
it couldn't have been immediately afterwards.

255
00:15:44,252 --> 00:15:46,952
Then why was his corpse swaying?

256
00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:48,952
He made himself sway.

257
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:52,552
The corpse did it on its own?

258
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,352
That's ridiculous!

259
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:55,952
Not the corpse.

260
00:15:55,952 --> 00:15:57,852
What we saw on the monitor was

261
00:15:57,852 --> 00:16:00,852
the killer pretending to be the corpse.

262
00:16:00,852 --> 00:16:03,052
What?

263
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:04,152
At 9 in the morning,

264
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:07,552
Mr. Mayama came to the cave just as his blackmailer had told him to

265
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:09,952
the night before.

266
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:12,452
The killer was waiting inside.

267
00:16:12,452 --> 00:16:15,152
He was the one who locked the door from the inside.

268
00:16:16,052 --> 00:16:20,952
It was so that he had an hour to commit the crime

269
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:23,852
until Mr. Hirai came to open the door at 10am.

270
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:29,252
The killer takes Mr. Mayama all the way into the cave.

271
00:16:30,152 --> 00:16:34,352
And with the rope that he brought with him strangled Mr. Mayama.

272
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:40,852
Then he wore Mr. Mayama's top and pants

273
00:16:40,852 --> 00:16:43,252
as well as wore the mask of Tengu,

274
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,852
merely to hide his own face.

275
00:16:47,852 --> 00:16:51,052
The killer climbed the cliff up to the shrine.

276
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,952
He tied one end of the rope that he strangled Mr. Mayama with

277
00:16:52,952 --> 00:16:55,252
onto the pillar,

278
00:16:55,252 --> 00:16:58,552
then broke it and dropped it down.

279
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,652
Next, he tied a separate onto himself like a harness

280
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:05,952
and hung himself from the pillar.

281
00:17:05,952 --> 00:17:08,252
I believe that the rope was tied

282
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:11,052
so that when he let go, the rope would come off.

283
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:12,852
He swung himself to gain momentum

284
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:15,752
and jumped over to a rock nearby where he could land on.

285
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:19,752
He landed on a ledge that was not in view of the monitor.

286
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:21,252
Please check it.

287
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:24,752
You should be able to find a scrap of the victim's top there.

288
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:32,052
Here it is.

289
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,252
He then put the top and pants back onto to Mr. Mayama,

290
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:40,452
and made him wear the mask of Tengu.

291
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:43,952
Doesn't everything fall too much in place?

292
00:17:43,952 --> 00:17:45,652
How the killer flee?

293
00:17:45,652 --> 00:17:49,452
How did he know that you people were coming?

294
00:17:49,452 --> 00:17:51,352
The voice of Tengu.

295
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:56,852
Tengus don't exist.

296
00:17:56,852 --> 00:17:59,252
It's actually the sound of the wind.

297
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:02,852
It occurs when the door of the cave is opened and closed.

298
00:18:02,852 --> 00:18:06,352
Although very slight the voices of people can also be heard.

299
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:07,952
This place is so narrow.

300
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:10,452
How are we going to get the corpse out of here?

301
00:18:11,252 --> 00:18:14,552
The killer heard us and hid.

302
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,252
Oh, I see.

303
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:18,852
And, who's the killer?

304
00:18:18,852 --> 00:18:21,352
Mr. Hirai is excluded

305
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:24,952
because he witnessed the body falling with us.

306
00:18:24,952 --> 00:18:27,352
-Then... -It's not me!

307
00:18:27,352 --> 00:18:31,352
Me neither. The killer probably climbed the cliff and fled.

308
00:18:31,352 --> 00:18:34,852
Right. You should search the mountains immediately!

309
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:37,152
Actually, there's something strange

310
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:38,952
about the Tengu's voice.

311
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,252
The first time we heard the Tengu's voice

312
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:46,052
is after Ran left here.

313
00:18:46,052 --> 00:18:47,452
Okay.

314
00:18:48,152 --> 00:18:50,452
In other words, the first Tengu's voice

315
00:18:50,452 --> 00:18:53,452
was when Ran opened the entrance door.

316
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:55,652
"First voice"

317
00:18:55,652 --> 00:18:56,852
The second time the voice was heard

318
00:18:56,852 --> 00:18:59,452
was just before Mr. Imazu appeared.

319
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:02,352
So, it was the sound of Mr. Imazu opening the door.

320
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:03,452
"Second voice"

321
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:07,952
No one could've entered or exited between them.

322
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:12,952
Mr. Shimomura, when did you come into the cave?

323
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:16,352
When? Right after you people came in.

324
00:19:16,352 --> 00:19:19,852
That is right after the first voice as you put it.

325
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:23,052
If so, you would've had to pass Ran.

326
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:25,752
You can't possibly tell me that you didn't pass her

327
00:19:25,752 --> 00:19:28,352
because it's so narrow.

328
00:19:28,352 --> 00:19:31,252
Maybe it was a little later.

329
00:19:31,252 --> 00:19:33,752
You must've misheard me.

330
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:36,952
Do you still insist on lying?

331
00:19:36,952 --> 00:19:38,652
I'm not lying.

332
00:19:38,652 --> 00:19:41,352
When we met you yesterday,

333
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:43,352
you had that cloth hanging from your neck,

334
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:45,352
but today it's wrapped around your neck.

335
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,452
Isn't it because you have a wound under it

336
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,452
that you don't want anyone to see?

337
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:52,052
Wounds of when you scraped yourself against uneven rocks.

338
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:53,652
Don't be ridiculous!

339
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:57,252
I got these while I was walking through the mountains.

340
00:19:57,252 --> 00:19:59,652
You can easily get away if it's just one scrape.

341
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:04,552
But can you explain the scrapes on your shins and thighs?

342
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:08,952
Inspector, please examine Mr. Mayama's body.

343
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:12,652
His clothes are torn, but he has no wounds.

344
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:19,952
I've confirmed it.

345
00:20:22,952 --> 00:20:27,552
Is the rope that you used to fall inside the backpack?

346
00:20:27,552 --> 00:20:28,752
That's right.

347
00:20:28,752 --> 00:20:31,752
But why, Sensei?

348
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:35,552
Several days ago when I was walking through the mountains,

349
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:37,852
I ran into a surveyor.

350
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:39,952
I asked him what he was surveying,

351
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:43,052
he said it was to turn this mountain

352
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:46,152
into a landfill for industrial waste.

353
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:48,752
Mr. Mayama received undocumented contributions for his campaign

354
00:20:48,752 --> 00:20:52,052
from the industry workers, for agreeing to this project.

355
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,852
I couldn't forgive him for it.

356
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:58,552
He was willing to destroy the town's valuable cultural property

357
00:20:58,552 --> 00:21:00,552
for his own benefit.

358
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,952
I had to do what I did to stop him.

359
00:21:03,952 --> 00:21:06,352
For the sake of the town, I had to become Tengu

360
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:08,952
and bring the hammer of justice down on him.

361
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:13,152
I pretended to be the blackmailer and summoned Mr. Mayama to come.

362
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:16,652
I figured he wouldn't come unless I did so.

363
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:19,352
I was surprised that the scaffolds where taken apart

364
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:21,452
but I didn't fret.

365
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:23,752
It would've been simpler if I'd made it

366
00:21:23,752 --> 00:21:27,952
to look like Mr. Mayama's body crashed onto the scaffolds,

367
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:30,952
but I couldn't be that devilish.

368
00:21:30,952 --> 00:21:33,252
It was just as I planned that

369
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:35,652
Mr. Hirai would witness the moment of the fall at 10am.

370
00:21:35,652 --> 00:21:40,652
I meant to flee while he went to call the police.

371
00:21:40,652 --> 00:21:42,052
But, I didn't think

372
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:45,452
he would be bringing the Great Detective Mouri with him.

373
00:21:45,452 --> 00:21:48,052
It would've been the same even if I didn't come.

374
00:21:48,052 --> 00:21:50,652
Because Mr. Imazu was outside.

375
00:21:51,752 --> 00:21:53,252
True.

376
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:28,552
It sure was some sharp deduction work, if I may say so myself.

377
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:32,352
He's become a real Tengu.

378
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,352
All his bragging may actually make his nose grow long.

379
00:23:42,752 --> 00:23:45,152
We ate before you because you didn't get up.

380
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,952
The perp of the murder case

381
00:23:46,952 --> 00:23:50,052
that happened the day before yesterday was caught.

382
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:53,352
Beautiful lady.

383
00:23:57,752 --> 00:24:01,152
What? You want me to lift up my hem?

384
00:24:04,752 --> 00:24:06,352
It's you after all.

385
00:24:07,152 --> 00:24:12,352
