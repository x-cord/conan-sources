1
00:00:01,477 --> 00:00:04,277
Rikumichi Kusuda a member of the Black Organization

2
00:00:04,277 --> 00:00:07,777
that snuck into the hospital where Rena Mizunashi is hospitalized...

3
00:00:07,777 --> 00:00:11,777
commits suicide after being pursued by agent Akai and I.

4
00:00:13,477 --> 00:00:15,977
Agent Akai declares that since if Kusuda was able to make contact,

5
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:20,177
the Organization would single out this hospital.

6
00:00:20,177 --> 00:00:22,877
The FBI works out remedial measures.

7
00:00:22,877 --> 00:00:25,477
But, there are many patients

8
00:00:25,477 --> 00:00:27,477
who cannot move from here, you know?

9
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:31,377
We can't just do nothing and wait

10
00:00:31,377 --> 00:00:32,577
when we know that the guys of the Organization

11
00:00:32,577 --> 00:00:34,477
will be raiding this place.

12
00:00:34,477 --> 00:00:36,177
We're not just going to wait,

13
00:00:36,177 --> 00:00:37,377
we're pulling out.

14
00:00:37,377 --> 00:00:39,177
Pulling out?

15
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:41,277
You mean we're leaving her behind and pulling out?

16
00:00:41,277 --> 00:00:42,677
No.

17
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:44,277
We're pulling out the strings and waiting.

18
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:48,377
Let's meet our enemy,

19
00:00:48,377 --> 00:00:50,877
the black wolves who've come

20
00:00:50,877 --> 00:00:53,677
to retrieve their straying colleague?

21
00:00:53,677 --> 00:00:55,377
We find out that agent Akai had in the past

22
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:57,877
snuck into the Black Organization

23
00:00:57,877 --> 00:01:01,877
and became the boyfriend of Haibara's older sister, Akemi Miyano.

24
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:09,577
Dai, if I get to quit the Organization after this job,

25
00:01:09,577 --> 00:01:13,577
will you go out with me as my real boyfriend?

26
00:01:18,577 --> 00:01:20,277
"Dai, if I get to quit the Organization after this job"

27
00:01:20,277 --> 00:01:21,977
"will you go out with me as my real boyfriend? Akemi."

28
00:01:24,177 --> 00:01:26,477
Hey.

29
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:29,077
May I talk to you for a while?

30
00:01:29,077 --> 00:01:31,177
If you're thinking of the strategy to counter-attack them,

31
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:33,477
I'm still thinking about it.

32
00:01:33,477 --> 00:01:37,577
But, I was looking at you,

33
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:40,177
and thought that maybe you're thinking exactly

34
00:01:40,177 --> 00:01:41,977
what I'm thinking.

35
00:01:48,077 --> 00:01:49,177
In the meantime,

36
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:52,477
Eisuke Hondo who is searching for the whereabouts of his older sister,

37
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:55,777
tracks down Rena Mizunashi's room.

38
00:01:57,677 --> 00:02:01,177
Hey, get up, Rena Mizunashi.

39
00:02:02,777 --> 00:02:04,577
If you don't wake up,

40
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:08,777
I can't ask you how my older sister Hidemi is doing!

41
00:02:08,777 --> 00:02:10,977
Hey, get up! Please get up!

42
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:13,377
You're going to be taken somewhere again, aren't you?

43
00:02:13,377 --> 00:02:14,777
Before that happens!

44
00:02:14,777 --> 00:02:15,977
Please open your eyes!

45
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:17,477
Hey!

46
00:02:20,177 --> 00:02:22,677
I'm telling you, open your eyes!

47
00:02:26,477 --> 00:02:28,777
No, Ei-chan.

48
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:34,777
Oh, wait.

49
00:02:34,777 --> 00:02:36,577
Are you one of the agents that have been summoned here?

50
00:02:36,577 --> 00:02:39,277
Oh, yes.

51
00:02:39,277 --> 00:02:41,077
I'm Andre Camel.

52
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,477
I just happened to get a call from my wife.

53
00:02:43,477 --> 00:02:45,577
Then, please hang up quickly.

54
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:46,977
We're having a strategy meeting.

55
00:02:51,977 --> 00:02:54,977
Yes, just as planned.

56
00:03:11,477 --> 00:03:14,377
You never fail to surprise me, sonny.

57
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:17,377
I'm glad you're on our side, Mr. Akai.

58
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:20,277
Thank god we've got you too, sonny.

59
00:03:28,577 --> 00:03:31,577
And what now, Mr. Akai?

60
00:03:35,777 --> 00:03:39,877
You think...

61
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:42,077
we should take on the risk?

62
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:52,377
Are you willing to try it?

63
00:04:09,277 --> 00:04:10,877
Sizzling hot suspense.

64
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:13,477
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

65
00:04:13,477 --> 00:04:15,477
Abnormal incidents occur everywhere.

66
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:17,477
Every incident leads to the hospital.

67
00:04:17,477 --> 00:04:18,977
He sees through the one and only truth.

68
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:20,677
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

69
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,577
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

70
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:54,118
"Red and Black Crash: Confusion."

71
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:56,591
We got ready three stretchers for moving patients

72
00:05:56,591 --> 00:06:00,091
as well as three vehicles we could load the stretchers onto.

73
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:01,091
If worse comes to worse,

74
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:02,191
we were going to use these

75
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:03,991
to confuse the guys of the Organization,

76
00:06:03,991 --> 00:06:05,691
while we attempt to take Rena Mizunashi

77
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:07,891
out of this hospital and flee.

78
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:12,291
It's a strategy that we would most like to avoid using though.

79
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,791
Any questions?

80
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,991
May I?

81
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:17,591
And about communication methods,

82
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:20,091
we can't use the cell phone or the wireless, is that right?

83
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:22,691
No, this is a hospital,

84
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:23,991
so please try to avoid using electronic devices,

85
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:26,191
they may interfere with medical equipment.

86
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:28,691
Cell phones are easy to tap, besides.

87
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:31,491
If anything comes up,

88
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,991
notify the leader of your block verbally.

89
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:34,491
Leaders, go outside to the parking lot

90
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:36,691
and notify James who is waiting there,

91
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:40,291
by wireless and get orders from him.

92
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:43,991
Talk about tedious.

93
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:47,091
Playing a telephone game like that,

94
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:50,991
is like giving them a chance to get what they want.

95
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:53,891
If all preparation for escape is ready,

96
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:57,891
I think it would be way better to move her out now.

97
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:01,591
No, that would be the last resort.

98
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:05,391
It's too dangerous to make a move from our side

99
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,691
when those guys still don't know where is Rena Mizunashi's room.

100
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:10,091
The guys of the Organization are probably keeping their eyes wide open

101
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:13,591
for cars that come out of the hospital.

102
00:07:13,591 --> 00:07:16,691
Judging from the fact that the car of the guy Kusuda

103
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:19,791
secretly had a heat detecting thermography equipped to it,

104
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,691
it's likely that they'll discover which is our car

105
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,191
from the number of people in the car,

106
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:27,191
thus making the FBI targets for their snipers.

107
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:32,791
Then, we'd have to flee through the shower of their bullets.

108
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,691
But, I wonder about not being able to make contact

109
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:36,791
during an emergency.

110
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,291
Of course in such case,

111
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,591
call me directly on the wireless.

112
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:43,391
I'll leave it to your discretion.

113
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:44,491
Yes, sir...

114
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:47,991
Well, I don't think they'll make a grand entrance,

115
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,591
arming themselves with guns and machine guns,

116
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:53,391
because they don't want the world to know that they exist.

117
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,991
Right, I agree.

118
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,591
They approach like a shadow

119
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:02,391
and vanish like a fog.

120
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:06,091
That's how they usually do their job.

121
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:07,291
Hey...

122
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,891
where were you?

123
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:10,691
The strategy meeting is over.

124
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:11,991
No problem.

125
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,391
With the three stretchers

126
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:17,391
and the three vans that are parked at the parking lot,

127
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:20,191
I already know the strategy.

128
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:22,391
I wouldn't call it a great strategy,

129
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:23,991
but I knew it was coming.

130
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:26,191
Right, sonny?

131
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:27,491
Yep!

132
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:32,991
What... what's with you two?

133
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:35,391
Besides, Conan...

134
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:38,091
isn't it time you head on home?

135
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:39,491
I'll be just fine.

136
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:42,491
I told everybody that I'll be sleeping over at Doc's tonight.

137
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:44,791
And I also took a cat nap.

138
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,191
Really...

139
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:47,791
Okay then.

140
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,291
I'll go stand in position for now.

141
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:54,991
But, please let me know

142
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:56,291
if you plan to split from here.

143
00:08:58,091 --> 00:09:01,991
I'm pretty confident about my driving technique.

144
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:04,291
Hey, Shu.

145
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,591
Doesn't that guy look familiar?

146
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:07,891
Huh?

147
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:09,391
He's among the additional agents

148
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:11,191
that were dispatched.

149
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:12,791
Well...

150
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,991
I'm not sure of the faces of people on our side.

151
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:20,091
I never forget the faces of my enemies though.

152
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:23,491
I guess it's only natural that he looks familiar.

153
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:26,091
After all he's an FBI agent just like us.

154
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:27,391
Yes.

155
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:29,291
But, when I look at him,

156
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,891
it makes me feel uneasy.

157
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:42,691
Hey... are you okay?

158
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,891
Yeah.

159
00:09:44,891 --> 00:09:46,791
I see that you haven't been sleeping much.

160
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,691
You've got black circles around your eyes.

161
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:50,691
No, he always had them.

162
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,791
Well, I'll go get a breath of fresh air

163
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,591
while I patrol the area.

164
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:55,791
Yeah.

165
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:01,091
Maybe Shu is getting too personally involved in this

166
00:10:01,091 --> 00:10:03,091
because of his girlfriend who was killed.

167
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:04,991
No, in his case,

168
00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:07,591
the more involved he is the better.

169
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:09,191
Akai who had been in that Organization before

170
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:12,691
and is aware of their way of doing things,

171
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:14,691
is an arch enemy

172
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:17,191
that they had tried to get rid of time and again.

173
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:21,691
For we, the FBI, he's an absolute ace is the hole.

174
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:26,491
"Family Restaurant Haido."

175
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:36,291
Sir?

176
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:39,391
Has something happened?

177
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:42,091
My stomach suddenly...

178
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:47,091
I'm sorry, same here...

179
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:48,791
The Tohto Kanjo outward track train

180
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,591
will be arriving at platform number four.

181
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:53,591
Please stand behind the white line to prevent accidents.

182
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:57,491
My throat...

183
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,991
-My eyes... -Don't you smell something strange?

184
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:01,891
Station master, please call an ambulance!

185
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:02,891
Okay!

186
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:05,991
"Yoko Okino starring in Kiss Note"

187
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:08,391
I've got to get that notebook back as soon as possible

188
00:11:08,391 --> 00:11:11,191
or else everybody's heart will be broken.

189
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:12,891
A fire has broken out.

190
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:14,691
Please obey instructions from the person in charge.

191
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:15,991
-No joke... -Give me a break?

192
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,791
Fire!

193
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,291
Huh? Mr. James Black?

194
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,091
There's no such patient by the name here.

195
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,691
No, I heard that he's not a patient here,

196
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:37,091
but a helper accompanying a patient...

197
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:39,491
I know him.

198
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,491
Oh, yes! Here's a delivery for him!

199
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:44,991
Who is it from? And what is it?

200
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:46,591
That...

201
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:49,091
The sender is...

202
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:51,591
It's from a Mr. Rikumichi Kusuda.

203
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:56,691
Rikumichi Kususda?

204
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:59,191
Yes, it's from a Mr. Kusuda,

205
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:01,791
and this is the delivery.

206
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:05,391
Flower?

207
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,891
A Columbine.

208
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:10,391
It's called Odamaki in Japanese.

209
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:12,591
The Organization sent this to me?

210
00:12:12,591 --> 00:12:15,291
Yes. They used the name of one of their members

211
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,691
who committed suicide last night as the sender,

212
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:20,091
so there's no doubt about it.

213
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:22,291
Our agents are disguised as security officers

214
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,991
and checking the bags of everyone entering the hospital,

215
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:27,591
we even checked delivery packages.

216
00:12:27,591 --> 00:12:30,391
Why would they send me a flower like this?

217
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:33,091
This Columbine is the state flower of Colorado.

218
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:35,391
It means getting hold of something for sure.

219
00:12:35,391 --> 00:12:37,591
In the language of flowers that what it means.

220
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:41,191
It has another meaning which is determined to win too.

221
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:43,891
Declaration of war.

222
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:45,391
Right?

223
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:47,691
Yeah, I guess so.

224
00:12:49,191 --> 00:12:50,491
Hey! Get a hold of yourself!

225
00:12:50,491 --> 00:12:51,791
We're at the hospital now!

226
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,591
I wonder if they're victims of the fire that we just saw a while ago.

227
00:12:57,591 --> 00:13:01,191
This is Maiya calling from the front entrance!

228
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:03,291
James Black here! Is something wrong?

229
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:08,091
So many ill patients and others are flooding the hospital!

230
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:09,791
I can't check them all!

231
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,491
What?

232
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,210
According to the wounded,

233
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,910
it seems that three different incidents

234
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,910
occurred in this vicinity at almost the same time.

235
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,810
Three incidents happened simultaneously?

236
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,110
Yes, group food poisoning,

237
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,610
bad odor chaos, and a break out of fire!

238
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,210
The Organization's done it?

239
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,210
The bad odor chaos and fire

240
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,310
can deliberately be caused at the same time,

241
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,010
but the incubation period for food poisoning

242
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,410
differs from person to person.

243
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,110
They probably used some kind of poisoning

244
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,010
that would result in a similar symptom.

245
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,710
Just like the other two cases,

246
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,610
their purpose is to come up with a lot of victims

247
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,010
without having to kill any of them,

248
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,410
but have them crowding over to this hospital.

249
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,010
Moreover, after excluding those with surface injuries

250
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,410
such as burns or cuts,

251
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,710
it's still difficult to determine

252
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,710
who is faking pain in their stomach, throat and eyes.

253
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,310
In other words, it's easy to make a large number of their members

254
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,110
sneak into the hospital.

255
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,110
Their purpose is to find

256
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,910
which room Rena Mizunashi is in.

257
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,110
If they use sheer force of numbers to look around for her,

258
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,510
they'll probably do it in no time at all.

259
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,510
No.

260
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,810
Not possible.

261
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,310
-Huh? -If they send in that many members

262
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,810
and start suspicious movement like that,

263
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,510
the number of members who would get caught

264
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,310
by the FBI may skyrocket.

265
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,210
They're not people who would risk doing something like that.

266
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,810
Then, what's all this racket for?

267
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,810
Yeah, they're probably after something else.

268
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,210
Hey, did you hear something just then?

269
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,410
That planter.

270
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,010
Huh...

271
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,810
Besides, the sound seems to be...

272
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,110
getting louder and louder.

273
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,910
Now that he mentioned it, very true.

274
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,210
Put in on the floor slowly and pull away from it.

275
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,010
Bomb?

276
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,310
Didn't you check inside the planter?

277
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,810
I... I'm sorry.

278
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,710
I was distracted by the flower. Besides...

279
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,910
Setting a bomb to this planter

280
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,610
would only succeed in killing a few agents.

281
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,110
If the Japanese police come here because of a bomb explodes,

282
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,110
searching for Rena Mizunashi would be difficult.

283
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,910
They could gain nothing from it.

284
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,210
That's what you thought, right?

285
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,210
Yes.

286
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,910
At any rate, we've got to do something about that bomb.

287
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,710
It looks to be full of traps

288
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,210
and it may take some time disassembling it.

289
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,910
So, I think it would be safer to take it to a place

290
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,810
where there're no people and dispose of it.

291
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,710
If this time is correct,

292
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,810
there is 31 minutes and 14 seconds to go.

293
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,310
Okay, Akai, we're counting on you.

294
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,510
-Okay. -No, you stay here, Shu.

295
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,810
I'll go.

296
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,010
There's a trash dump seven kilometers from here,

297
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,010
so I'll drive over there.

298
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,210
Use my car, then.

299
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:00,410
I wonder if you can get there in time?

300
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,810
Because three incidents happened at once,

301
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,310
all the major roads are jammed.

302
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,810
Getting there in 30 minutes isn't going to be easy.

303
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,810
Well, if you were to take a navigator

304
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,110
who knows the roads in this vicinity,

305
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,210
it would be a different story, though.

306
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,310
Hey you!

307
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,610
What do you think you're doing leaving your post?

308
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,610
I heard about the terrible traffic jam

309
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,510
from the people who came to this hospital,

310
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,410
so I came to report it to you.

311
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,910
I happen to be posted close by,

312
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,110
so I thought it was faster to directly report it myself.

313
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,210
We have no time to waste talking!

314
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,110
You two both go and take care of the bomb!

315
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,310
Roger...

316
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,810
Something bothers me.

317
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,310
Huh? You mean Camel?

318
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,510
It's true he doesn't have the most amiable looks.

319
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,110
No, I mean the bomb.

320
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,710
It was set deliberately, so that the time indicator would show,

321
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,010
and moreover rigged so that it would gradually get louder.

322
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,110
It's as if they wanted us to find the bomb.

323
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,410
Also, isn't it strange that they gave us more than 30 minutes?

324
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,810
It's as if they set the time ahead,

325
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:05,210
so that the FBI agents would take the bomb elsewhere to explode.

326
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,810
Then, what the heck is that bomb for?

327
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,410
I wonder what they're after?

328
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,210
Hey! Are you really sure

329
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,410
that this is the short cut to the trash dump?

330
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,310
How strange.

331
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,810
This was completely empty two years ago.

332
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,610
Two years ago?

333
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,710
By the way, is there a clock

334
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,110
or something in the trunk behind?

335
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,710
The noisy ticking has been bugging me for some time now.

336
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,310
What? Oh God!

337
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,910
Why didn't you hurry up and say so?

338
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:50,110
Hey! There's no clock in here!

339
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,010
Hey! Did you really hear something like that?

340
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,210
-He's gone? -You'd better hurry inside

341
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,410
or I'm going to leave you behind.

342
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,310
Why are you sitting in the driver's seat?

343
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,710
It's too much trouble trying to verbally explain the back roads.

344
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,310
And I've got better driving skills.

345
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,310
Besides, we don't seem to have much time left either.

346
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,810
So, you lied to me about the clock in the trunk?

347
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,110
Yes, circumstances may justify a lie.

348
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,910
Hey... just what do you think you're doing?

349
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,310
Hang on tight!

350
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,310
Hey?

351
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,110
Hey...

352
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,310
Hey! The trash dump is in the direction opposite from here!

353
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,410
I've given up going there

354
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,410
because there's no time left.

355
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,610
Huh?

356
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,510
All we need is an unoccupied place, right?

357
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,510
Quick, will you examine her?

358
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,410
You idiot! We were here first!

359
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,910
There are a lot of deliverymen around.

360
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,010
Yeah, there sure are a lot of them.

361
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,610
What shall I do...

362
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,810
Sorry.

363
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,910
Excuse me.

364
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,810
Kusuda...

365
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,010
Rikumichi Kusuda.

366
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,510
Jodie, is everything okay on your side?

367
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,310
It's about time the bomb explodes.

368
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,110
Well...

369
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,710
Agent Camel forced me off the wheels and he's driving now...

370
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,610
What're you doing by opening the roof?

371
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,310
-The wheels... -What?

372
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,210
Steer please!

373
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,310
What?

374
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,310
Hey!

375
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,010
What was that sound just now?

376
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,010
Jodie?

377
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,810
Yes, sir. The bomb was gotten rid of just now.

378
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,410
Good work, Jodie.

379
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,810
Oh, no.

380
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,010
Agent Camel is the one who should be given credit for it.

381
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,010
I hate to think what would have happened

382
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,210
without his driving technique.

383
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,110
By the way, how are things over there?

384
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:23,610
Akai and Conan found a clue

385
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,710
as to what the Organization is up to doing.

386
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,410
Yes?

387
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,710
Excuse me, I'm a security officer.

388
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,910
I'm sure the nurse brought you a delivery just now.

389
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,010
Oh, yes, this is it.

390
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,110
Isn't it from a person named Kusuda?

391
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:41,510
Yes, but I don't know anyone by that name.

392
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,010
Excuse me.

393
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,410
It's a bomb after all.

394
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,410
What is that?

395
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,010
It's a wiretap.

396
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:02,810
A new type of fraud is widespread nowadays using this device.

397
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,510
A Bomb?

398
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,410
The contents of the get well gift

399
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,810
was a bomb after all?

400
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,910
Yes.

401
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,410
This plastic bomb alone

402
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,210
is only capable of blowing up one room.

403
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,010
But if several of these go off together...

404
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,110
This hospital will unmistakably collapse.

405
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,010
"Next Episode" -There is only four hours to go

406
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:57,810
before the bombs that are delivered to the hospital explode.

407
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,910
While the FBI agents go all out retrieving the bombs,

408
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,210
the image of Rena Mizunashi returning to work on TV

409
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,210
is suddenly aired!

410
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,510
Realizing what they were after,

411
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:12,510
I worked on a strategy to outdo their trap but...

412
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:17,110
Next on Detective Conan,

413
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:21,410
"Black and Red Crash: Camouflage."

414
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,910
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,610
Driving Technique.

416
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,910
March 3rd is Ear Day.

417
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,910
-It's Girl's Day. -Goldfish Day.

418
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,310
Oh, really?
