1
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:05,296
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,996
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:06,997 --> 00:00:08,396
Sense of vision, hearing and smell.

4
00:00:08,397 --> 00:00:09,896
An alibi relying on these three senses.

5
00:00:09,897 --> 00:00:11,696
The clue to invalidating the alibi is a past incident!

6
00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:13,296
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:14,796
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,797 --> 00:00:17,197
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,114 --> 00:02:00,676
"Request from a Queer Family (Part 2)"

10
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:03,078
In other words, the suspects are...

11
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,478
Daisaku, the family head that confined in his room blowing the flute,

12
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,578
Tsugutaka, the oldest son who was illustrating

13
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:13,578
and the second son, Shigehide who was writing a novel.

14
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:14,973
These three men.

15
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,298
No. Up to now,

16
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:20,198
all the deductions were made based on Conan leading everyone to them.

17
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,598
It's as if the thoughts that cross an innocent child's mind

18
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,898
coincidentally serve as hints to reach a conclusion,

19
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:26,899
but it can only be done

20
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,698
because he is secretly having Shinichi make the deductions.

21
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:31,798
Even up to now,

22
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:35,998
I've never seen him making phone calls before coming up with an idea.

23
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:38,798
If so, there is only one thing I can think of.

24
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:39,998
That this child...

25
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:41,299
Conan himself...

26
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:43,899
is Shinichi.

27
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,898
That's why all the calls from Shinichi come in with no number display.

28
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:51,398
So that I can't call him from my side.

29
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:55,198
But during the school festival, they were both together.

30
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,299
Am I taking my imagination too far after all?

31
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:00,398
No, don't be deceived!

32
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:03,598
I'm sure Shinichi used some kind of trick!

33
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,498
What's the matter, Ran?

34
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:07,498
No, it's nothing.

35
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:08,898
I see.

36
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:10,598
I've got to make sure.

37
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,698
Come to think of it, right after I sent the mail to Shinichi,

38
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:15,499
Conan's cell phone...

39
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:19,098
I'm going to send that mail once more.

40
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,398
And this time for sure...

41
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:25,199
I'll get hold of conclusive evidence that he can't get away with.

42
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:30,698
No way.

43
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,499
It's not responding.

44
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,198
A visitor?

45
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,698
Were you expecting somebody?

46
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,498
No.

47
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:40,498
It says my mail's been sent.

48
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:42,498
So what happened this morning was a coincidence after all?

49
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:43,698
Well, I guess so.

50
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:46,298
Conan couldn't possibly be Shinichi.

51
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:48,698
No, it's Shinichi!

52
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:50,198
He could be using some method

53
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,598
that is unthinkable for ordinary people to think up.

54
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,298
If you're going to be that way,

55
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,798
I'm not going to take my eyes off you,

56
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,198
not even for an instant, until you expose yourself.

57
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,799
So, you'd better be ready, Shinichi!

58
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,698
I wonder if it's just another prank?

59
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:05,699
A prank?

60
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,798
There are times when the doorbell rings, but there's no one there.

61
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,098
But it's really bad today. It's already happened several times.

62
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,198
It usually happens only once a week.

63
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:17,998
But it's already this time of day to be a prank by children.

64
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:22,198
One of the three probably rang the door chime using some method,

65
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,698
and rigged up some alibi trick while the door was being answered.

66
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,698
It's true that the alibi of the three

67
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:30,298
is being supported by the housekeepers who brought their dinner

68
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:33,798
during the time of the crime, which was around 7:30.

69
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:36,698
But they did not directly see any of the three.

70
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:40,698
If so, the most suspicious would be Tsugutaka,

71
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,398
the husband of Tomoko who had been killed.

72
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,298
If he saw the mail in her cell phone

73
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:46,898
that came from the one she was having an affair with,

74
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:48,398
that would be a motive, too.

75
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,698
If Mrs. Kariya was having an affair...

76
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,898
I don't think Mr. Kariya would have overlooked it.

77
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,798
Why do you think so?

78
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:59,998
12 years ago when Eisuke, his third son's fiance

79
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,598
was killed in the phone booth,

80
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,598
they were actually on a date.

81
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:08,098
The first phone call was from Eisuke asking him if it was okay

82
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,498
to let Motoka spend the night over because she had missed the last train.

83
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:13,698
Mr. Kariya who was in the living room

84
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:15,798
asked for Motoka to come on the phone.

85
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:20,398
If a girl like you ever dare come through the door of the Kariya residence,

86
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,099
I'll see to it that you do not live!

87
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,198
Was Motoka also having an affair?

88
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,598
I don't know how Mr. Kariya found out, but...

89
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:31,098
I think they both stayed at the phone booth

90
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:33,598
without being able to make it home and was killed there.

91
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,598
Was the police notified?

92
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:37,998
I only know that there was a phone call.

93
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:40,798
Shigehide told us that it had nothing to do with the case,

94
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,298
so that it wasn't necessary to report it.

95
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,498
Which means that the only person

96
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:47,198
that had nothing to do with Tomoko was Shigehide.

97
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,198
About that...

98
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,798
We heard Tomoko and Shigehide arguing in the corridor a month ago.

99
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:57,198
Something about "It's terrible to eavesdrop."

100
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,198
It was about the dialogue of the parents of the main character

101
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,198
that appear in the novel which is to be dramatized soon...

102
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,898
Being very similar to their own.

103
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:07,898
Mrs. Kariya was outraged saying that if the dialogue is not changed

104
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,498
before the dramatization, she would sue him.

105
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:11,798
As a result, Shigehide agreed to change the dialogue

106
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:14,798
and everything seems to have been settled.

107
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:17,798
What? You're all still here?

108
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,598
Did you find the killer?

109
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,798
Oh, not yet.

110
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:25,298
By the way, at around 7:30 when your dinner was delivered to you,

111
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:26,698
you answered through the sliding paper door,

112
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,898
"It's been a long time since we had curry for dinner."

113
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,898
But how did you know it was curry?

114
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:35,398
The aroma. The sliding door was slightly opened.

115
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,898
What's this used for?

116
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:41,798
I use it to listen to my flute teacher play and practice.

117
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,898
I'm making process day by day.

118
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,498
Now that I don't go out often,

119
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:48,399
playing the flute is my only favourite pastime.

120
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:54,398
So ever since he hurt his leg at work, he haven't gone out much.

121
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,198
Yes, since he used to stay at home all the time,

122
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,698
he found out that his wife was having an affair with someone else,

123
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,298
and got a divorce.

124
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:07,598
I see. That's why he is very sensitive to extra-marital.

125
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,198
Curry was one of the dishes that his wife was good at.

126
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,698
That's why you didn't make curry too often?

127
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,798
Out of consideration for Mr. Kariya.

128
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:19,598
Yes, we were actually thinking of making beef stew.

129
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,298
But we decided to change it to curry just 10 minutes before serving it.

130
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:24,598
Hey, come on! That's enough.

131
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,498
I just told you that I was in this room at night around 7:30!

132
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:32,398
When you were served dinner, you raised your hand and responded.

133
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,998
She saw your silhouette through the sliding paper door

134
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:36,898
but she didn't actually see you in person.

135
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:38,198
You mean you think I rigged it so that my silhouette

136
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,998
would be reflected on the paper door?

137
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:41,098
No.

138
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,998
I don't think that's possible.

139
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:44,798
I can tell whether it is actually the silhouette of a person or not.

140
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:45,998
I see.

141
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,198
So now that you're done, go on home, will you?

142
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,398
Thanks to you police people, I haven't been able concentrate,

143
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,699
and haven't made any progress in my work!

144
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,598
One of his family members has died

145
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,798
and yet he doesn't shed a tear at all.

146
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,398
It's a wonder he's a writer of pure love novels.

147
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,998
He sure doesn't look to be one.

148
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:05,198
Talking about not looking to be one,

149
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,298
when we first met them you were saying...

150
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:09,299
Hey, Ran?

151
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,498
What?

152
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:14,199
You were saying that you thought he was much older.

153
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,199
That's because the people who come out in his novels don't dye their hair.

154
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,898
Even if people with dyed hair come out, they're treated as delinquents.

155
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:25,098
That's why I thought he was pretty old.

156
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:26,298
Besides,

157
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:28,898
his story usually has scenes in which the main characters are at the place

158
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:31,298
they're supposed to meet, and yet, they don't get to see each other

159
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:33,598
because a pillar is in the way. Just like in some old movie.

160
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,098
It's so sad watching the characters waiting and worrying,

161
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,398
concerned about their loved ones that don't show up.

162
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,298
They're so different from somebody I know,

163
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:44,999
that's always close by, yet insists on secretly watching his partner.

164
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:48,698
You think so too, don't you, Conan?

165
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:52,098
I can't really tell because I'm just a child.

166
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,398
You think so, don't you?

167
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,499
Yes.

168
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,098
Enough.

169
00:08:57,099 --> 00:09:00,398
I have nothing more to say than that I was here, right through.

170
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,298
But smelling the aroma of the pipe when dinner was brought here

171
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:06,598
is not enough to serve as proof of an alibi.

172
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:08,298
Then who was smoking the pipe?

173
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,198
Are you saying that there was Ninja or something around?

174
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:11,399
A Ninja?

175
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:14,399
You ate the curry.

176
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,498
By the way, did somebody come again?

177
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:19,298
I heard the doorbell ring a while ago.

178
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:22,199
No. It seems that somebody played a prank again.

179
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:28,498
I think that Tsugutaka is quite upset over this prank.

180
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:30,898
Each time he returned from outside,

181
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,598
he used to ask if any pranks were played.

182
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:36,798
When we told him there were, he used to get into a foul mood.

183
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,598
And he used to get really upset over crank calls, too.

184
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:41,599
Crank calls?

185
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,798
Yes, it rings once, and hangs up.

186
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:47,298
It rings for some time and then hangs up. We were getting strange calls.

187
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:48,798
We got a one today, too.

188
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,298
When you came, a little after 8:00.

189
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,598
Was it an undisplayed number?

190
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:53,898
No, the thing is...

191
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,098
Although the phone call came in

192
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:57,398
it wasn't displayed in the incoming call history.

193
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,398
Don't tell me that the chime we heard just a while ago?

194
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,798
Hey, Ran!

195
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,198
What?

196
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:04,598
You sent mail out a while ago, didn't you?

197
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:05,599
You did, didn't you?

198
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:07,599
Yes, I did!

199
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,898
Is that wrong?

200
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,799
Did you verify the address?

201
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,398
I didn't have to verify it because all I did was re-send the mail

202
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,798
I sent out this morning.

203
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,698
Oh, no.

204
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:19,598
Who did I mail this out to?

205
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,298
Just as I thought after all.

206
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:24,298
That's why she found the cell phone so easily.

207
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:27,098
Which means that person is the killer.

208
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:28,598
The killer used the case of 12 years ago

209
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:30,699
to hide his shadow within the dark.

210
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,999
So that he alone could continue to stay in the light.

211
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,063
I guess it's about time we call it a day then.

212
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:44,064
Yes.

213
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:45,263
I think it'll be difficult to undo their alibi

214
00:10:45,264 --> 00:10:47,863
unless we use some sort of magic.

215
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:49,463
Magic?

216
00:10:49,464 --> 00:10:52,964
I saw a fantastic magic show on TV the other day!

217
00:10:54,164 --> 00:10:56,663
This lady is in a rectangular box.

218
00:10:56,664 --> 00:11:00,363
Her face, hands and legs are sticking out, but her body splits into three.

219
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:01,764
Talk about shocking!

220
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:05,663
You idiot! There are three people in there.

221
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:08,463
Really? I guess you can't deceive people carrying it out alone,

222
00:11:08,464 --> 00:11:11,363
but if there are others to help you, it's possible!

223
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:13,863
So what?

224
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:18,963
If one of the three helps out, then the alibi trick will work?

225
00:11:18,964 --> 00:11:20,463
It's not possible,

226
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:24,964
because the meals were delivered to three rooms that are apart.

227
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:28,963
For some reason,

228
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:31,363
Mrs. Kariya finds the cell phone that she had lost in the house,

229
00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:33,863
and as soon as she does so, she is killed.

230
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:37,763
The three men who live in this house are to be suspected, that's for sure.

231
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:41,963
Yes. The cell phone was also missing from the scene of the murder.

232
00:11:41,964 --> 00:11:43,663
But, Ran...

233
00:11:43,664 --> 00:11:45,463
Don't you think that the person who is hiding that cell phone

234
00:11:45,464 --> 00:11:48,163
-is really stupid? -Huh?

235
00:11:48,164 --> 00:11:50,463
Because while we were looking for the cell phone,

236
00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:52,263
no matter how many times we called,

237
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:54,763
the person kept answering and hanging up right away, right?

238
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:56,263
Of course.

239
00:11:56,264 --> 00:11:59,463
Because once his voice is heard, it would be obvious who he is.

240
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:00,464
But if it were me,

241
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:04,063
if I knew that such an in convenient phone call would be coming,

242
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:06,164
I would switch off my cell phone.

243
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:11,563
Which means that Shinichi did have his cell phone switched off?

244
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,963
You idiot!

245
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:16,963
He was waiting for Tomoko's man to call or mail her,

246
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:18,763
that's why he didn't switch off her phone.

247
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:22,463
If so, he could've adjusted the volume of her cell phone.

248
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:25,863
Because he was getting repeated calls.

249
00:12:25,864 --> 00:12:30,063
Or, was it that he didn't know how to operate the phone?

250
00:12:30,064 --> 00:12:31,763
I'm sure he knew what he was doing

251
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:33,863
because he knew how to unlock the cell phone.

252
00:12:33,864 --> 00:12:37,163
But even if the cell phone were to be locked, it would be obvious

253
00:12:37,164 --> 00:12:39,863
that four digits would have to be entered in order to unlock the phone.

254
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:41,663
Therefore, even if the killer had no idea how to use the phone,

255
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:44,663
so long as he had time, I'm sure he would've been able to unlock it.

256
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:48,163
Anyone can find out how to use it by just touching it here and there.

257
00:12:48,164 --> 00:12:50,363
It took me a while to get used to it though.

258
00:12:50,364 --> 00:12:54,563
You're talking about back when you first bought your cell phone, right?

259
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:57,863
Right, right. There aren't too many people who do not know

260
00:12:57,864 --> 00:12:59,663
how to use a cell phone in this day and age.

261
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:02,963
If that person were to be locked up somewhere for about 10 years or so,

262
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:04,263
then maybe...

263
00:13:04,264 --> 00:13:05,264
10 years?

264
00:13:05,265 --> 00:13:06,363
Come to think of it,

265
00:13:06,364 --> 00:13:09,163
the use of cell phone became widespread about 10 years ago.

266
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:12,463
Hey, wasn't it about 12 years ago?

267
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:14,163
That the third son Eisuke's fiance was killed

268
00:13:14,164 --> 00:13:16,863
and his whereabouts became unknown?

269
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:21,163
Could it have been Eisuke that had Tomoko's cell phone?

270
00:13:21,164 --> 00:13:23,863
Don't tell me that he's somewhere in this house?

271
00:13:23,864 --> 00:13:27,863
Which means that one of the three was hiding him.

272
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,163
It's understandable

273
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:32,163
that after being separated from the outside world for 12 years,

274
00:13:32,164 --> 00:13:36,263
he finds the cell phone and becomes interested in it, and takes it away.

275
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:37,763
It was after all,

276
00:13:37,764 --> 00:13:41,163
Eisuke's friend who got a call from the cell phone that was lost.

277
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:42,363
If it were him,

278
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,963
he probably had a lot of time to figure out how to unlock the phone.

279
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:47,863
And when he went to return the phone, Tomoko found him,

280
00:13:47,864 --> 00:13:49,863
so he killed her along with whoever was hiding him

281
00:13:49,864 --> 00:13:52,363
in order to keep her from talking.

282
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,663
The alibi would become invalid.

283
00:13:54,664 --> 00:13:57,663
Okay! Go get a search warrant.

284
00:13:57,664 --> 00:14:01,163
Eisuke could be the killer of the incident that happened 12 years ago.

285
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:02,963
Yes, sir.

286
00:14:02,964 --> 00:14:05,663
The problem is, who's sheltering him?

287
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:08,463
I think the most suspicious is the head of the household, Daisaku.

288
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:10,663
There was a radio cassette recorder in his room, right?

289
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:13,363
He probably recorded his voice,

290
00:14:13,364 --> 00:14:15,363
"It's been a long time since we had curry for dinner."

291
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:19,963
And at the time of the crime around 7:30, he made Eisuke

292
00:14:19,964 --> 00:14:23,664
that he was sheltering push the button in order to establish his alibi.

293
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,764
I think I'm kind of hungry.

294
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:31,063
Would you like to have some curry? There's still some more left.

295
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:34,363
No, it's okay. It was supposed to be beef stew, right?

296
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:36,963
And you changed it to curry 10 minutes before you served it, right?

297
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:39,263
-So, I'll bet it's not that good anyway. -10 minutes ago.

298
00:14:39,264 --> 00:14:41,163
Means about 7:20.

299
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:45,163
It takes more than 20 minutes to the murder site from here.

300
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:50,363
He'll have to leave by a little after 7:00 to make it in time.

301
00:14:50,364 --> 00:14:53,763
Then it's Tsugutaka who was smoking his pipe in the room

302
00:14:53,764 --> 00:14:54,863
and illustrating in his room.

303
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:59,563
As for the aroma from the pipe, all he had to do was make Eisuke smoke it.

304
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:03,063
Curry is my favourite, so maybe I'll have some after all.

305
00:15:03,064 --> 00:15:04,064
Huh?

306
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:06,863
In fact, I was thinking of taking the curry that was outside the man's room

307
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,964
somewhere else and eat it.

308
00:15:10,964 --> 00:15:12,263
But I decided against it.

309
00:15:12,264 --> 00:15:13,963
Because if the plate of curry disappears,

310
00:15:13,964 --> 00:15:16,763
it'll be easy to figure out who ate the curry!

311
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:18,063
Wait a second.

312
00:15:18,064 --> 00:15:21,963
If Tsugutaka made Eisuke stay in his room to serve his double,

313
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,763
why didn't he make him take the curry into his room?

314
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:26,563
That would make it look more like he was in the room.

315
00:15:26,564 --> 00:15:29,363
He probably couldn't come out

316
00:15:29,364 --> 00:15:31,763
because he's someone that shouldn't be around.

317
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,763
Even so, Tsugutaka would've noticed the dish after coming back

318
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:37,763
from the murder site and would've taken it inside.

319
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:39,663
If he left it outside his room,

320
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:42,063
it would only give way to suspicion

321
00:15:42,064 --> 00:15:44,463
that he wasn't in his room during the time of the crime.

322
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:48,763
Besides, Tsugutaka had eaten the curry after it had gotten cold.

323
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:50,863
There is no reason why he wouldn't take it into his room.

324
00:15:50,864 --> 00:15:52,763
If so, the remaining suspect would be

325
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:54,863
the one who was writing a novel in his room,

326
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:57,364
Shigehide.

327
00:15:58,864 --> 00:16:01,763
I killed Tomoko?

328
00:16:01,764 --> 00:16:03,963
I'm sheltering my kid brother Eisuke?

329
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,763
You've got to be kidding!

330
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:09,363
But if so, everything falls into place.

331
00:16:09,364 --> 00:16:13,663
You made Eisuke have his hair done like yours.

332
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:15,563
Then you make him respond through the sliding paper door

333
00:16:15,564 --> 00:16:16,764
isn't all that difficult.

334
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:22,963
Mr. Tsubouchi from the editing section.

335
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:24,763
I'm sort of busy right now.

336
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:27,163
Yes. I'll call you back.

337
00:16:27,164 --> 00:16:29,563
You're mean, aren't you, mister?

338
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:31,963
You use a cell phone,

339
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:35,463
but you don't let the characters in your novel use it.

340
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:38,063
Why don't you let them use it?

341
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,963
It's not that you didn't know about cell phone, right?

342
00:16:40,964 --> 00:16:42,063
It can't be.

343
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:44,763
Were you making your kid brother write the novels?

344
00:16:44,764 --> 00:16:47,563
That's why there weren't too many people who dyed their hair in the novel.

345
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:51,463
12 years ago, not too many people used to dye their hair yet.

346
00:16:51,464 --> 00:16:52,663
Which means it's true

347
00:16:52,664 --> 00:16:56,263
that the conversation between Mr. and Mrs. Kariya were used, too.

348
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:58,263
If he lives in the attic,

349
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:00,463
he'll be able to hear all the conversation that goes on in the house.

350
00:17:00,464 --> 00:17:01,964
Well, that's...

351
00:17:04,364 --> 00:17:05,364
It's enough already.

352
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:08,163
It's enough,

353
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:09,164
Shigehide.

354
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:11,164
You're...

355
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:14,463
Yes. I'm Eisuke Kariya, who killed my fiance 12 years ago

356
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:17,763
and was being protected by my older brother all this time.

357
00:17:17,764 --> 00:17:21,263
Because of the words of my father that I heard back then through the phone.

358
00:17:21,264 --> 00:17:25,563
If a girl like you ever dare come through the door of the Kariya residence,

359
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:27,064
I'll see to it that you do not live!

360
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:32,163
We got into an argument, I lost my temper and killed Motoka.

361
00:17:32,164 --> 00:17:34,663
I was planning to kill myself, too.

362
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:38,463
But I was in shock and found myself at home when Shigehide found me.

363
00:17:38,464 --> 00:17:40,563
Shigehide, I'm in trouble, I killed Motoka.

364
00:17:40,564 --> 00:17:42,963
Don't worry! I'll work something out.

365
00:17:42,964 --> 00:17:44,963
And you've stayed in the attic ever since.

366
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,963
Yes. I thought of turning myself in many times,

367
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:49,363
but just couldn't find the courage to do so.

368
00:17:49,364 --> 00:17:51,364
I had no intention of killing her.

369
00:17:52,664 --> 00:17:55,663
Then why did you hit her after you stabbed her?

370
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:56,963
You hit her, didn't you?

371
00:17:56,964 --> 00:17:59,164
No. I only stabbed her.

372
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:04,763
So it's you who killed Motoka 12 years ago.

373
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:06,063
What the...

374
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:08,863
Wait! Why would Shigehide kill Motoka?

375
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:14,463
Maybe because he was the one who was having an affair with Motoka?

376
00:18:14,464 --> 00:18:17,463
I see! If it's an affair within the same household.

377
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,063
It's understandable that Daisuke who didn't go out often

378
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,263
would find out about it, too.

379
00:18:20,264 --> 00:18:24,963
Yes. And you killed Tomoko who found out about it to shut her up.

380
00:18:24,964 --> 00:18:27,263
Using the same method you used 12 years ago.

381
00:18:27,264 --> 00:18:30,863
You figured if push came to shove, you would put all the blame on Eisuke.

382
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:32,463
That's ridiculous.

383
00:18:32,464 --> 00:18:35,863
Shigehide protected me for the past 12 years.

384
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:39,163
No. He protected you because if the police arrested you,

385
00:18:39,164 --> 00:18:40,963
everything would be disclosed!

386
00:18:40,964 --> 00:18:43,463
The fact is that, after you stabbed Motoka,

387
00:18:43,464 --> 00:18:46,563
he killed her with a finishing blow!

388
00:18:46,564 --> 00:18:48,363
That's not true, right?

389
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:51,763
No. Why would I do something like that?

390
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,063
I remember Mrs. Kariya saying

391
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:56,463
that the ringtone of the cell phone was a strange one.

392
00:18:56,464 --> 00:18:58,663
Shut up. Be quiet!

393
00:18:58,664 --> 00:19:00,463
If you want to set me up as the killer that badly,

394
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:03,364
show me proof that I did it.

395
00:19:05,064 --> 00:19:06,064
Guests again?

396
00:19:06,065 --> 00:19:08,964
No, I think it's the sound for incoming mail.

397
00:19:10,064 --> 00:19:15,063
Mrs. Kariya disappeared while looking for the cell phone, remember?

398
00:19:15,064 --> 00:19:18,363
She had my cell phone at that time,

399
00:19:18,364 --> 00:19:21,163
so she sent mail to her cell phone repeatedly

400
00:19:21,164 --> 00:19:24,263
and found her cell phone with the sound of incoming mail.

401
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:25,363
I see.

402
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,563
No matter what button I pushed, I couldn't stop this sound.

403
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:31,463
I got all flustered when Tomoko showed up at the attic.

404
00:19:31,464 --> 00:19:33,664
I was able to stop the sound of the cell phone, but...

405
00:19:38,164 --> 00:19:40,863
The ringtone is the same as that of the Kariya family.

406
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:43,263
I see. If left that way, no matter where in the house you are,

407
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:46,263
you will have an excuse to leave. So you can answer the call or e-mails

408
00:19:46,264 --> 00:19:49,763
from the one you're having an affair with.

409
00:19:49,764 --> 00:19:52,863
And the fact that the sound is ringing now

410
00:19:52,864 --> 00:19:55,363
means that the cell phone is somewhere in this room.

411
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:58,763
Shigehide, the cell phone that you took from the scene of the murder,

412
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,364
Tomoko's cell phone.

413
00:20:05,364 --> 00:20:07,763
You should've thrown it away immediately.

414
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:09,863
He was probably too scared to throw it away

415
00:20:09,864 --> 00:20:13,863
until he confirmed whether or not she told anybody about his kid brother.

416
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:16,963
Well, the truth will come out as soon as we check out the fingerprints

417
00:20:16,964 --> 00:20:18,263
on the murder weapon and the blood on it.

418
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:23,063
If only she didn't say what she did.

419
00:20:23,064 --> 00:20:25,763
Where do you think I found this cell phone?

420
00:20:25,764 --> 00:20:29,163
Your very curious kid brother had it.

421
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:32,263
The one inside the dark attic, made to write novels to past his time away,

422
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,363
so that his older brother could get all the glory,

423
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:37,163
that poor kid brother of yours.

424
00:20:37,164 --> 00:20:39,463
Okay. To start things off, give me 10,000,000 yen.

425
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:43,363
We'll talk over the details thoroughly in a different place.

426
00:20:43,364 --> 00:20:47,363
That's why you told me to write the novel here tonight and went out?

427
00:20:47,364 --> 00:20:49,863
Yes. 12 years ago, too.

428
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:53,863
I first went to see if she was okay because she was stabbed.

429
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:54,963
Her wound was not serious,

430
00:20:54,964 --> 00:20:57,163
so I was going to take her to the hospital. But...

431
00:20:57,164 --> 00:20:59,463
Take responsibility, will you?

432
00:20:59,464 --> 00:21:00,863
Take responsibility and get married to you?

433
00:21:00,864 --> 00:21:02,163
You idiot!

434
00:21:02,164 --> 00:21:05,063
I would never marry into a house with such an old fart living there.

435
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,663
Money!

436
00:21:06,664 --> 00:21:08,963
Now that things turned out the way they did,

437
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:10,463
I'm going to leech you till you die and suck you to the bones,

438
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:12,064
so be prepared!

439
00:21:13,364 --> 00:21:14,564
Shigehide.

440
00:21:15,864 --> 00:21:17,663
I'm not worthy of being your brother.

441
00:21:17,664 --> 00:21:20,063
If you didn't have the writing talent you did,

442
00:21:20,064 --> 00:21:23,363
I probably would have killed you the first chance I had.

443
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:24,863
Shigehide.

444
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,063
Well, I guess I didn't do so

445
00:21:27,064 --> 00:21:33,364
because I wanted to read the continuation of your novels.

446
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:02,763
But what a queer family they were.

447
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:03,863
You were really fantastic, Pops.

448
00:23:03,864 --> 00:23:05,563
You solved the case in no time at all!

449
00:23:05,564 --> 00:23:06,764
Well, it was really no big deal.

450
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:10,463
You're fantastic yourself, Shinichi.

451
00:23:10,464 --> 00:23:13,363
Acting out as a slightly intelligent grade school child. How splendid.

452
00:23:13,364 --> 00:23:18,563
You're a big centre forward manipulating a small mid-fielder.

453
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:22,863
A fantasista who sends accurate passes and leads the ball to the goal.

454
00:23:22,864 --> 00:23:24,163
But why?

455
00:23:24,164 --> 00:23:25,863
Why are you doing this?

456
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:28,363
Why won't you tell me the truth?

457
00:23:28,364 --> 00:23:30,563
I mean we're so close together.

458
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:31,864
Why?

459
00:23:33,864 --> 00:23:35,264
We're finally home.

460
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:37,563
Hurry up and get off!

461
00:23:37,564 --> 00:23:39,063
I've got to go return the car.

462
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:40,064
Okay.

463
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:45,564
Ran, hurry up.

464
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:48,464
Make sure you have the bath ready!

465
00:23:57,164 --> 00:23:58,463
"Next Episode"

466
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,263
I guess he sort of realize it after all.

467
00:24:00,264 --> 00:24:02,564
That I'm suspicious of his true identity.

468
00:24:03,464 --> 00:24:05,663
A married couple who gets along great.

469
00:24:05,664 --> 00:24:08,864
Shinichi, what numbers would you prefer?

470
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:12,163
If I remember it correctly...

471
00:24:12,164 --> 00:24:15,363
What did Shinichi answer?

472
00:24:15,364 --> 00:24:16,564
I can't remember.

473
00:24:17,564 --> 00:24:19,564
There's only one way I can find out.

474

Next Conan, "Suspicious Ran".
