1
00:00:00,797 --> 00:00:02,796
Liar.

2
00:00:02,797 --> 00:00:04,297
Thief.

3
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:15,097
Sonoko?

4
00:00:16,097 --> 00:00:20,396
All the programs for today have ended.

5
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:24,197
Thank you very much for your patronage.

6
00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:27,396
What's the matter, Sonoko?

7
00:00:27,397 --> 00:00:30,696
You're the one who wanted to come to watch this thief movie, right?

8
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,396
But...

9
00:00:32,397 --> 00:00:35,196
Part one was really good

10
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:37,397
so I expected this one to be even better.

11
00:00:38,397 --> 00:00:40,996
But, they're just doing the same thing over again?

12
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:43,496
Talk about a meaningless part two!

13
00:00:43,497 --> 00:00:47,296
I see. I kind of enjoyed it.

14
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,196
Kind of isn't good enough!

15
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:52,597
Well, most second editions are like that.

16
00:00:54,497 --> 00:00:57,396
How I wish that somewhere,

17
00:00:57,397 --> 00:01:01,096
an incident so incredible would make my heart beat so badly

18
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:04,396
that it would erase all the sounds around me!

19
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,297
Sonoko.

20
00:01:07,897 --> 00:01:12,497
Come to think of it, I haven't seen that guy around recently.

21
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:34,996
Today's culprit is Thief Kid.

22
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:36,296
He may be able to deceive everyone else,

23
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:38,396
but I'm protecting the treasure and my dream.

24
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:39,996
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:39,997 --> 00:01:41,796
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:43,797
His name is Detective Conan!

27
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:59,597
This is what I wanted to see.

28
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:02,897
Hey!

29
00:02:05,497 --> 00:02:07,496
Wait up, you!

30
00:02:07,497 --> 00:02:10,296
When you bump into people you're supposed to apologize!

31
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,896
Hey, Sonoko.

32
00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:13,497
Sonoko, your bag...

33
00:02:14,897 --> 00:02:15,997
-Mugged? -Mugged?

34
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,997
Sonoko, stay here!

35
00:02:20,997 --> 00:02:24,196
Why should I listen to that glasses boy?

36
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:25,997
Hey, wait!

37
00:02:57,697 --> 00:02:59,796
Go get him, Lupin!

38
00:02:59,797 --> 00:03:01,097
Lupin?

39
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,397
Stop it.

40
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:35,776
"Thief Kid's Wondrous Sky Walk."

41
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:37,976
That hurt.

42
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,409
How dare you snatch the bag of a fragile lady?

43
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,909
I'm going to write about you in a corner of my biography.

44
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,410
That hurt.

45
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,009
Hey, young lady, hurry and contact the police, please.

46
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,010
Yes. Thank you.

47
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,710
Thank you too, doggy.

48
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,609
Well, even if Lupin here were to let him get away,

49
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:06,109
with my Ultra Classic 1500 cc Twin Cam model

50
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,609
he could never have gotten away anyway.

51
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,009
If the situation calls for it, I have a speed-up function

52
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,310
rigged to this motorbike, too.

53
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,909
Uncle?

54
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,510
Aren't you Uncle Jirokichi?

55
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,909
You're Shiro's daughter!

56
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,509
The last time I saw you, was at the Seven-Five-Three Festival!

57
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,109
They know each other?

58
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,609
Looks to be so.

59
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,209
He's my father's cousin

60
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,909
and advisor for the Suzuki Financial Group,

61
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,209
Uncle Jirokichi Suzuki.

62
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,109
How do you do?

63
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,909
But uncle, when did you come here?

64
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,509
I heard that you went out on a trip 6 months ago.

65
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,609
I just got back last week.

66
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,609
I went the world over and finally found it

67
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,909
so I came back.

68
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,109
The best bait in the world.

69
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,409
Bait?

70
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,710
-Bait? -Bait?

71
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,709
There are so many medals and trophies here!

72
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,909
The European Golf Open, the US Cup yacht race

73
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,809
and worldwide fast hamburger eater contest!

74
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,109
And, all of them are the first prize.

75
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,109
Amazing. This old man's won the Savanna Rally, too.

76
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,709
Check this one out!

77
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,909
Around the world on a man-powered plane.

78
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,010
The pastime of a rich man.

79
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,409
Was this statue here from before?

80
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,609
Yes, it's the Golden Goddess that was decorated

81
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,209
on the bow of the Sea Goddess

82
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,909
during the Grand Navigation Era

83
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,109
when the pirates used to raid ships.

84
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,409
That thing that she is holding up in her right hand

85
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,809
is the legendary aquamarine,

86
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,609
which is said to have turned

87
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,809
into a gemstone from the tears of a mermaid.

88
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,709
It has the power to prevent disasters at sea

89
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,209
and is known as the miracle of the ocean,

90
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,610
Blue Wonder!

91
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,109
It is valued very highly as an artistic work

92
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,709
and I had a hell of a time bidding it off.

93
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,009
I finally got hold of it last week.

94
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,609
Then, don't tell me that this is the bait that you mentioned

95
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,209
-just a while ago? -Exactly, this is the bait.

96
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,710
To fish that guy!

97
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,409
Fish what guy?

98
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,609
It's been 72 years since I've come to this world

99
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,909
and there is not one time that I, Jirokichi,

100
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,809
has ever let prey go in my life.

101
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,909
Yes. I've gotten every award that I've gone after

102
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,509
and realized every dream that I've ever had.

103
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,709
But, there is just one thing in this world

104
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,409
that I just couldn't get a hold of.

105
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,409
That guy slips through the tightest security

106
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,809
and the most armored vaults.

107
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,909
He is a white sinner who magically breaks through everything in his way

108
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,009
and spreads his wings gracefully,

109
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,610
flying off into the night sky.

110
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,309
Hey, wait a minute.

111
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,009
Don't tell me that you're referring to...

112
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,509
Yes. His name is...

113
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,409
"Mouri Detective Agency" -The Thief Kid?

114
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,109
"Making a declaration to the Thief Kid.

115
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,209
The big jewel that you so desire,

116
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,409
the miracle of the ocean, Blue Wonder,

117
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,009
has been placed on the roof of the Great Museum in Shiodome.

118
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,209
If you want it, come and get it.

119
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,210
Advisor for the Suzuki Financial Group, Jirokichi Suzuki."

120
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:19,209
To declare something like this on the front pages of the papers.

121
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,909
Rich people sure are something.

122
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,309
But, it's a bit exciting.

123
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,009
You idiot. He won't show up.

124
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,309
A super-rich dude is sending out

125
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,509
a challenging demand like this full of confidence.

126
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,709
Who in the world would fly right into a trap

127
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,909
that is so well set up?

128
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,609
Exactly.

129
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,009
But, Sonoko was saying that just a while ago,

130
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,309
her Uncle Jirokichi got an okay mail

131
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,109
from the Thief Kid on his cell phone.

132
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,309
Okay?

133
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,109
What?

134
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,009
It seems that he's going to come

135
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,709
to check the place out this Saturday or something.

136
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,109
See, here's that mail.

137
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,209
She forwarded it to my cell phone, too.

138
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,310
Let me see.

139
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,709
"I shall respond to your challenge.

140
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,709
I will go to get what I want on April 12th at 20:00.

141
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,809
However, please forgive me

142
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,409
for going to check the place out on the night before.

143
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,709
Thief Kid."

144
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,710
"P.S."

145
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:15,709
He sure has a way of putting on airs like always.

146
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,109
What's the P.S. after the mail?

147
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,809
Post script?

148
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,809
Just as the name has it, I shall walk over and appear.

149
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,110
He's going to walk over?

150
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:41,793
Just what're you doing?

151
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:43,593
Never mind. Get on with the check, go ahead and check!

152
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:45,493
Make sure that all the roads leading to this museum are blocked

153
00:08:45,494 --> 00:08:46,693
and officers are standing guard.

154
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:50,394
Don't let one suspicious thing get through! Understand?

155
00:08:52,894 --> 00:08:55,994
Gosh! Those choppers sure are noisy.

156
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:01,194
What? You don't know how you should identify the Thief Kid?

157
00:09:02,194 --> 00:09:05,394
Pull on his face! His face, get that?

158
00:09:06,794 --> 00:09:08,293
Inspector.

159
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:09,493
Don't pull softly.

160
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:11,793
But, strongly!

161
00:09:11,794 --> 00:09:14,694
Firm and tight. Understand?

162
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:19,193
Inspector Nakamori is really into this.

163
00:09:19,194 --> 00:09:21,194
Hey, Ran!

164
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:24,894
Sonoko.

165
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:27,293
Ran!

166
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:29,694
What a flashy appearance.

167
00:09:31,694 --> 00:09:34,593
Did Thief Kid appear already?

168
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:36,994
No, not yet.

169
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:43,393
This man with the slight mustache is Ran's father,

170
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:44,993
the Sleeping Kogoro.

171
00:09:44,994 --> 00:09:46,394
Slight mustache?

172
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:49,593
I've heard a lot of rumors about you.

173
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:52,093
Is that so?

174
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:53,993
Hey! Are you the one?

175
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,593
Who started this riot to begin with?

176
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:57,594
What?

177
00:09:57,595 --> 00:10:00,494
Do something about your helicopters up there!

178
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:05,393
They're in getting in the way of the police choppers!

179
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:07,793
There's no need for police choppers, is there?

180
00:10:07,794 --> 00:10:11,294
The Thief Kid announced he was going to walk over here after all.

181
00:10:12,294 --> 00:10:15,593
Then, why do you have so many helicopters up there like that?

182
00:10:15,594 --> 00:10:19,394
Those helicopters are up there to film my autobiography.

183
00:10:20,294 --> 00:10:22,294
Film an autobiography?

184
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:27,593
Amazing.

185
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:30,393
It's like an outside broadcast van of the TV station.

186
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,793
The helicopters aren't the only ones shooting the film.

187
00:10:32,794 --> 00:10:35,393
All the images that are filmed by the cameras

188
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:39,193
that are set in 100 places all over the museum can be viewed here.

189
00:10:39,194 --> 00:10:43,194
Hey. There's nobody inside the museum.

190
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:46,993
There were too many up to now.

191
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,193
Since there's nobody there, even if he were to disguise himself

192
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:50,693
and sneak in there,

193
00:10:50,694 --> 00:10:52,693
it would be plain for all to see, right?

194
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,593
Since it's possible to open and lock

195
00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:57,893
all the doors of the museum from here

196
00:10:57,894 --> 00:11:01,893
even if he were to get to the roof where the Golden Goddess is,

197
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,494
the most that he'll end up doing is get locked up.

198
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:09,694
That is if he shows up just as he said he would.

199
00:11:13,494 --> 00:11:14,793
I think he's here.

200
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:15,794
What?

201
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:18,194
Where?

202
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:23,993
Can't we get a larger view?

203
00:11:23,994 --> 00:11:26,393
Over here. Right here.

204
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,394
-Hurry it up! -Yes, sir.

205
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:39,393
So, he's appeared.

206
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:40,493
Thief...

207
00:11:40,494 --> 00:11:42,294
Thief Kid!

208
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:44,893
Hey! Which one is it?

209
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:47,793
Which helicopter is the image coming from?

210
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,793
Which helicopter is shooting the film?

211
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:51,493
Helicopter number 7, sir!

212
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:54,093
From behind the museum, I think.

213
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:56,193
Behind the museum?

214
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:57,194
Okay!

215
00:11:57,195 --> 00:11:58,694
In the back?

216
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:01,293
Conan?

217
00:12:01,294 --> 00:12:02,593
What shall we do?

218
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:06,493
Shall we move the Golden Goddess inside using that device, just in case.

219
00:12:06,494 --> 00:12:08,493
Come on. Cool it.

220
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,293
He's just checking the place out tonight.

221
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:11,593
He won't steal it yet.

222
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:14,993
Besides, he announced he'd come on foot.

223
00:12:14,994 --> 00:12:18,293
Hey, move it!

224
00:12:18,294 --> 00:12:19,793
Outta the way!

225
00:12:19,794 --> 00:12:21,893
Let's watch how the great thief,

226
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:23,893
the so-called illusionist under the moonlight

227
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:26,094
will make his appearance.

228
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:34,693
Hey! Where is the Thief Kid?

229
00:12:34,694 --> 00:12:37,493
Well, after he went across between the buildings,

230
00:12:37,494 --> 00:12:38,693
he hasn't come out.

231
00:12:38,694 --> 00:12:41,994
Come on out. Thief Kid.

232
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:46,193
You can't walk unless you come down on the ground.

233
00:12:46,194 --> 00:12:48,994
Come on out, Thief Kid.

234
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:08,694
What the...

235
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,894
No way! No way.

236
00:13:18,194 --> 00:13:21,293
Darling Thief Kid, he's floating in the air.

237
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:22,494
Fantastic!

238
00:13:27,094 --> 00:13:30,193
No way! How can this be?

239
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:32,994
How is he defying gravity...

240
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:38,292
and floating in the midair?

241
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,990
Don't be deceived! This is a trick!

242
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:53,390
Thief Kid is just riding a black blimp

243
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:57,290
or something with his body suspended in the air with a wire.

244
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:01,291
Any helicopters that are nearby, film his head and confirm!

245
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:06,090
Chopper no.7 here.

246
00:14:06,091 --> 00:14:07,690
There's nothing above Thief Kid's head.

247
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:09,190
What?

248
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:11,590
Thief Kid sure is amazing.

249
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:14,291
-Don't you think so, Ran? -Yes.

250
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,790
Chopper no.7 here.

251
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,190
What shall we do?

252
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:21,890
Don't move from there for a while.

253
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:22,991
Roger!

254
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:26,390
That Thief Kid, just what kind of trick is he using anyway?

255
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:27,790
There's no way he can float like that.

256
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,691
Look for the rope.

257
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:36,390
Already making such a big fuss. The show's just begun.

258
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:38,190
If he's not up there...

259
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:40,390
The side? I get it.

260
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:41,990
The wire is hooked on to the buildings on both sides

261
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:43,590
and he's suspending himself with it.

262
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,390
Okay. I'll go to the building on the left,

263
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:47,390
so you go to the one on the right

264
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:48,990
and look for the wire on the roof!

265
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:49,991
Yes, sir!

266
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:52,090
Darn.

267
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,391
That Thief Kid, how dare he play around with us like this?

268
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,090
It's nothing more than magic, plain illusion.

269
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:04,090
Just you wait, Thief Kid.

270
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:06,191
All I have to do is see through your trick...

271
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:10,890
Nothing? There's no wire anywhere?

272
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:12,490
There's nothing here!

273
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:13,891
There's no wire anywhere.

274
00:15:14,891 --> 00:15:16,490
Inspector Nakamori!

275
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:18,990
There's nothing on this side of the building either.

276
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:22,690
It can't be. Then, how is he up there?

277
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:24,891
How is he floating in the air?

278
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:31,091
Ladies and gentlemen!

279
00:15:36,691 --> 00:15:39,090
So, on this day, before my actual feat will be carried out,

280
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:40,790
please watch to your heart's content

281
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,491
the miracle that my legs will perform.

282
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,291
He's walking...

283
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,791
He's walking?

284
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:56,591
Amazing, he's walking.

285
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:04,390
This is chopper no.3, Thief Kid is still walking in the air.

286
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:06,791
It can't be. What kind of trick is he using anyway?

287
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:22,390
Hang on. My darling Thief Kid is walking?

288
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:23,790
Amazing.

289
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:24,890
I see.

290
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:26,090
So that's what he meant by

291
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:28,190
he'll come on foot to get his target.

292
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:31,590
Detective Mouri, never mind that,

293
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,890
but please tell me how is he performing this feat

294
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:35,590
that goes against all laws of nature.

295
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:36,990
This is chopper no.3.

296
00:16:36,991 --> 00:16:40,190
Thief Kid is now walking over the skies of Shiodome Park.

297
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,190
If he goes on as is,

298
00:16:42,191 --> 00:16:44,590
he will reach the roof of the Suzuki Museum

299
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:46,791
where the Blue Wonder is in less than a minute.

300
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:01,691
Thief Kid will reach the Blue Wonder in a few seconds.

301
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:04,791
Uncle.

302
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:08,190
You mean we can't do a thing

303
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:09,790
but just watch him steal the stuff right before our eyes?

304
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,090
Darn. That Thief Kid.

305
00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:14,590
How is he planning to flee,

306
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:17,890
when there are police officers on the ground and choppers in the air?

307
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:21,691
Advisor, don't you think it's time we start the device?

308
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:25,291
We've got no choice.

309
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:40,690
So, this will be all for the show the night before.

310
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:44,491
I will see you again tomorrow at 20:00 at the same place.

311
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:49,391
Darn.

312
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,290
Didn't I tell you that you're going to be sorry

313
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,990
if you underestimate Thief Kid?

314
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,590
I won't let him steal it.

315
00:17:57,591 --> 00:18:01,090
Because I went all over the world to look for it

316
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:05,191
and finally got hold of the "Miracle of the Ocean", Blue Wonder.

317
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:09,290
Why is the golden statue inside and upside down?

318
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,391
This is how it's rigged.

319
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,690
I see.

320
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:24,691
It rotates so the real one is exchanged for the fake.

321
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:28,390
Thief Kid will see through a childish thing like this right away.

322
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:32,790
Of course I don't intend to deceive him with something like this.

323
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,790
If so, leave everything to the police tomorrow

324
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,290
and keep your helicopters from flying.

325
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,390
Stay put and stay still.

326
00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:41,190
I'm doing just the opposite.

327
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:42,590
The opposite?

328
00:18:42,591 --> 00:18:46,790
He vanished saying let's meet at the same place tomorrow night.

329
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,291
If he so wishes, I will do exactly that and ambush him.

330
00:18:50,691 --> 00:18:53,390
What do you mean by ambushing him?

331
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:57,190
I'm going to rent practically all the buildings in this area

332
00:18:57,191 --> 00:18:58,890
and be prepared for him with a helicopter squad

333
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:00,990
and security guard unit even greater than tonight.

334
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,090
I don't know what kind of trick he's using to walk floating in the air,

335
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:07,390
but if he dares come out again, I'm going to nab him

336
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,591
and add him on to the final episode of my autobiography.

337
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:14,890
Don't move. Don't move.

338
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:16,591
Stay still!

339
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:19,790
What's happened?

340
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,190
Never mind and just don't move!

341
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:24,990
If you move, you'll never walk before me again!

342
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:27,590
Where? Where is it?

343
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:28,691
Don't you dare move.

344
00:19:34,391 --> 00:19:35,590
There it is!

345
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,391
What's with this dog?

346
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:40,290
Just as expected of Lupin.

347
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,091
He will never let a prey that he is after go.

348
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:45,490
Contacts?

349
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:48,590
I didn't know your eyes were bad, Uncle Jirokichi?

350
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:51,790
Well, at 72 years, all parts of my body

351
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,390
are refusing to work the way they should.

352
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:56,890
Your body seems to be working just fine.

353
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:59,990
I would at least like to nab him while I'm still alive and kicking.

354
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:03,290
What makes you want to pursue Thief Kid as much as you do?

355
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,290
Kid, Thief Kid.

356
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,890
The sound of that name itself,

357
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:09,490
the one who stole everything from me, that Thief Kid.

358
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:12,090
I'll never forgive him.

359
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:15,990
Listen, I, Jirokichi Suzuki will nab him!

360
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:17,790
I won't let anyone get in my way!

361
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,890
I won't let you have your way, Kid. Just you watch!

362
00:20:20,891 --> 00:20:23,891
I promise, I swear.

363
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,790
You've already seen the many honorary gifts

364
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,490
and awards I have won so far.

365
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:33,090
They've always covered the headlines of the papers.

366
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:35,190
All except for one time.

367
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:36,790
Don't tell me that's why you're going after him?

368
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:37,990
Yes, exactly!

369
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:39,990
That Thief Kid not only stole the headline from me,

370
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:41,590
he also stole the 2nd page from me!

371
00:20:41,591 --> 00:20:44,490
My article of having flown the world over on a manned plane

372
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:47,390
was pushed over to a corner on the 3rd page because of him!

373
00:20:47,391 --> 00:20:49,590
Do you understand how humiliated I felt?

374
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:52,390
Can you understand how sad I felt?

375
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:54,390
A bit, I guess.

376
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:56,490
When I do get my hands on him,

377
00:20:56,491 --> 00:21:00,765
I, Jirokichi Suzuki, will be on the front page once again!

378
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,190
Really look at the huge number of helicopters.

379
00:22:57,191 --> 00:22:59,290
More than the helicopters, the number of onlookers here

380
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,990
is even more surprising.

381
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:03,390
They should've put up a "Keep out" sign.

382
00:23:03,391 --> 00:23:05,790
Uncle had them come in deliberately

383
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,790
because he wanted the arrest scene of the Thief Kid

384
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:10,090
to be complemented by genuine extras.

385
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,390
Come to think of it, the advertisement for introducing

386
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,190
that large museum as well as the special program

387
00:23:14,191 --> 00:23:16,290
was really flashy and filmed from the air.

388
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,990
But, wouldn't it be difficult

389
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:20,290
to find Thief Kid among this large crowd?

390
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:24,790
Don't worry, he has special seats reserved for us.

391
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,290
Ms. Sonoko Suzuki, we've been waiting for you.

392
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,490
Thank you.

393
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,990
Please follow me, everyone to the seat over that way.

394
00:23:30,991 --> 00:23:33,090
Hey, is this for real?

395
00:23:33,091 --> 00:23:35,291
This is the roof.

396
00:23:37,491 --> 00:23:40,290
Would you like anything to drink?

397
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:41,590
We'll leave it up to you.

398
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:45,290
For the first time, she kind of looks like a rich little lady.

399
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,390
This certainly is the roof of the building

400
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:49,490
near the building where Thief Kid appeared,

401
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:52,090
because the only ones here beside us are the security guards.

402
00:23:52,091 --> 00:23:54,190
I still don't understand.

403
00:23:54,191 --> 00:23:57,590
I looked through the image the helicopter sent afterwards,

404
00:23:57,591 --> 00:24:00,290
but there was nothing strange in it.

405
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,290
Moreover, he vanished in midair.

406
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,991
Just how on earth did he do it?

407
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:08,690
I'll go get it.

408
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:10,191
I'm sorry!

409
00:24:12,991 --> 00:24:15,690
A scratch? It seems like something got stuck here.

410
00:24:15,691 --> 00:24:18,091
And it's still new.

411
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,390
Do you see what I see?

412
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:23,390
A multitude of helicopters practically covered the entire sky.

413
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:25,290
And look at the many security guards that are positioned

414
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,990
all through the vicinity.

415
00:24:26,991 --> 00:24:28,990
This is indeed a handpicked unit of security guards

416
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:30,590
that the Suzuki Financial Group has gotten together

417
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:32,090
to maintain their prestige.

418
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:35,890
Will he really appears under such tight security?

419
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,790
The one who forewarned that he would steal Blue Wonder

420
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:40,990
that is decorated on the roof of the great Suzuki Museum.

421
00:24:40,991 --> 00:24:42,990
The Thief Kid!

422
00:24:42,991 --> 00:24:45,790
He'll come. Of course, he'll come.

423
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,890
It sure doesn't sound like a remark that would come out

424
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:49,290
of the mouth of a little lady of the Suzuki Financial Group

425
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:51,390
whose treasure is the target of theft.

426
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:53,890
But, he's the Thief Kid, you know.

427
00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:57,190
If just this once, I'd sure like to see him in person.

428
00:24:57,191 --> 00:25:01,890
I actually wanted to hold the Golden Goddess statue

429
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:04,890
with a lot of gemstones on it that is on the roof,

430
00:25:04,891 --> 00:25:08,590
but Uncle Jirokichi wouldn't let me.

431
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:09,990
Of course he wouldn't let you.

432
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:11,790
Don't tell me you wished

433
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:14,190
that he would take you away with him, gemstones and all?

434
00:25:14,191 --> 00:25:17,490
Right, exactly, and Makoto would come to rescue me,

435
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:20,491
who is being held captive.

436
00:25:21,491 --> 00:25:25,491
I, Sonoko wouldn't know what to do with two men fighting over me.

437
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:28,890
I guess

438
00:25:28,891 --> 00:25:32,190
all this abnormal security around here can't be helped.

439
00:25:32,191 --> 00:25:34,490
After all he declares that he is coming to check the place out last night

440
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,690
and appears by the building right beside this one floating in midair.

441
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:41,690
He walks in midair and closes in on the museum.

442
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:42,790
Then, he suddenly vanishes.

443
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,791
I guess it's understandable,

444
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,590
since he is the great thief that they are all trying to arrest.

445
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,290
Really, he was walking in midair

446
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:50,090
as though there were no tricks involved.

447
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,291
I'm sure that there are tricks and magic involved.

448
00:25:53,191 --> 00:25:56,290
Because if people can so easily walk in midair,

449
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:58,790
it would surprise the birdies, right?

450
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,090
-Birdies, he says. -Oh, my.

451
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:03,391
What a cute thing to say, Conan.

452
00:26:04,591 --> 00:26:06,391
Maybe the remark was a bit too childish.

453
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:11,690
Brat, let Thief Kid's magic surprise you and the birdies.

454
00:26:11,691 --> 00:26:13,990
I don't know what trick he used yet,

455
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:15,290
but we may found the marks that he left behind

456
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:17,190
when he set up the trick.

457
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:19,390
See! The scratch on the wall over there

458
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:21,591
looks as if something was hooked on!

459
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:23,790
The scratch is still new

460
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,191
so it could be something that Thief Kid left behind.

461
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:28,991
Well?

462
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:31,790
There's one over that side, too?

463
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,790
Are you sure that there's a mark

464
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,390
that looks similar on the building on your side, too?

465
00:26:35,391 --> 00:26:38,090
Yes, a brand new scratch.

466
00:26:38,091 --> 00:26:40,290
But, I wonder what the mark is?

467
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:44,790
Maybe he hooked a wire up from this building to the other?

468
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:47,190
Thief Kid probably did so to put people under the illusion

469
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:49,990
that he was floating in midair.

470
00:26:49,991 --> 00:26:51,390
No way.

471
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:55,390
Inspector Nakamori who climbed the other building last night said

472
00:26:55,391 --> 00:26:58,890
that there were no wires or anything like that.

473
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:01,290
Besides, if he's suspended from something like that,

474
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:02,790
he wouldn't be able to walk.

475
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,890
Right.

476
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:07,690
Hey, maybe he set up a device to project a 3-D image?

477
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:09,990
And, that's what left the traces?

478
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:13,390
See, if he projected from two sides, this side and that side.

479
00:27:13,391 --> 00:27:14,790
Impossible. He couldn't have done something like that

480
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,390
with the technique of this day and age.

481
00:27:16,391 --> 00:27:20,290
It's impossible to project such a clear moving 3-D image

482
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:22,390
in a space where there's nothing.

483
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,091
Then, do you know how he carried out the trick, dad?

484
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:27,390
Sort of.

485
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:28,990
What kind of trick did he use?

486
00:27:28,991 --> 00:27:32,690
When people think that something is not there,

487
00:27:32,691 --> 00:27:34,790
they have a way of not being able to see it

488
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:37,291
because of the influence of preconceived ideas, even if it's there.

489
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:39,490
-Preconceived ideas? -Preconceived ideas?

490
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,491
And?

491
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,590
Just what is that something supposed to be?

492
00:27:42,591 --> 00:27:44,690
Well, for example...

493
00:27:44,691 --> 00:27:47,190
A super huge hard glass.

494
00:27:47,191 --> 00:27:52,390
He placed it over one building to the other and walked on it.

495
00:27:52,391 --> 00:27:54,690
Inspector Nakamori probably didn't notice it

496
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:57,890
because he didn't think that the glass was there.

497
00:27:57,891 --> 00:28:01,090
It could be that the scratch was made when the equipment

498
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:03,390
that held the glass in place was removed.

499
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:07,390
If such a glass were there, somebody is bound to have seen it.

500
00:28:07,391 --> 00:28:08,690
That's why I said...

501
00:28:08,691 --> 00:28:11,090
In the first place, how would he have brought something

502
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:13,190
as large as that along, and then put it away as well?

503
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,690
That's why I said it could be that.

504
00:28:16,691 --> 00:28:19,290
Not being able to see it because of preconceived ideas?

505
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:22,390
Kid...

506
00:28:22,391 --> 00:28:25,890
Inspector Nakamori, so many people are flowing in

507
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:27,690
that it's impossible to keep checking them!

508
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:29,090
It seems that the Suzuki Financial Group

509
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:31,990
passed out a leaflet saying, "Welcome fans of Thief Kid".

510
00:28:31,991 --> 00:28:33,690
Passed out leaflets?

511
00:28:33,691 --> 00:28:35,291
If things are left as is, a riot may break out.

512
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:39,290
It can't be helped, let them through without checking them!

513
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:40,390
Roger!

514
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:42,991
He's probably going to come from the sky anyway.

515
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:48,290
Darn! The security structure of the police is a mess,

516
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,990
thanks to that attention-craving old man.

517
00:28:50,991 --> 00:28:53,490
You're the owner of the Miracle of the Ocean, Blue Wonder,

518
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:56,790
the advisor for the Suzuki Financial Group, Jirokichi Suzuki, aren't you?

519
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:58,490
Indeed.

520
00:28:58,491 --> 00:29:00,990
It's an hour more to go before the time declared by Thief Kid,

521
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:03,790
but are you more than prepared to take him on?

522
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:07,090
It seems that he put on a cheap magic show last night,

523
00:29:07,091 --> 00:29:09,890
but tonight I shall be the one to put on a show.

524
00:29:09,891 --> 00:29:11,790
I'll show you all a dramatical arrest

525
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,890
that will make Hollywood movies look like child's play!

526
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:17,090
Gee, my uncle is really out for the kill!

527
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:19,190
Let's take a short commercial break then.

528
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:21,790
The new talk of the town that has opened in Shiodome,

529
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,790
bringing along with it the fragrance of history and culture

530
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:24,990
is the Great Suzuki Museum.

531
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:28,390
Hey, even the commercial is about the museum?

532
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,390
It's a tie-up, you know? A tie-up.

533
00:29:30,391 --> 00:29:33,690
Uncle never misses chances like these.

534
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:34,890
Even this aerial film

535
00:29:34,891 --> 00:29:37,190
is a cut and paste of what he used in the special program.

536
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:41,090
Though he may not look it, he's quite thrifty.

537
00:29:41,091 --> 00:29:43,190
Please come quickly, my dear Thief Kid.

538
00:29:43,191 --> 00:29:45,390
And please steal my passionate heart away.

539
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:48,090
What's the use seeing him in a noisy place like this?

540
00:29:48,091 --> 00:29:50,890
Besides, the wind's so strong, too.

541
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:52,290
Wind?

542
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,390
What's the matter?

543
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,990
I'm going over to where Uncle Jirokichi is for a while.

544
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:59,290
I just realized something interesting!

545
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:01,290
Just what is that interesting thing?

546
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:02,391
It's a secret!

547
00:30:03,391 --> 00:30:08,390
What? Show you the film of yesterday's Thief Kid again?

548
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:12,490
Yes, Uncle Mouri insisted that I look at it no matter what.

549
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:15,790
Sonny, you watched it more than enough last night, didn't you?

550
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:18,090
Besides, it's already been sent to the staff

551
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:20,490
that are making his autobiographic movie.

552
00:30:20,491 --> 00:30:22,790
What?

553
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:25,090
Well, but the film will eventually

554
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:28,990
be submitted to the police afterwards.

555
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:32,390
After all, Thief Kid has never come to check any place out

556
00:30:32,391 --> 00:30:34,890
like he did last night, ever before in the past.

557
00:30:34,891 --> 00:30:36,790
Come to think of it, he's right.

558
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,291
I wonder why Thief Kid put on such a demonstration?

559
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:43,990
It's less than a minute to go before the time declared by Thief Kid.

560
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:47,590
The Thief Kid fans who have gathered here are starting to countdown.

561
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:50,991
Let's all watch this miraculous moment, too.

562
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:53,690
He won't come.

563
00:30:53,691 --> 00:30:56,890
No magician would ever let any viewer up on stage

564
00:30:56,891 --> 00:31:00,490
before the show starts and let them surround him.

565
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:03,590
Because he would be revealing the secret of his trick that way.

566
00:31:03,591 --> 00:31:05,990
Although he declared that he would appear again tonight

567
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:08,490
between those two buildings,

568
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,290
where the eyes of all the spectators are on him

569
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:11,790
and the wind of the helicopters

570
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:16,191
are going to blow his hand glider out of control.

571
00:31:17,691 --> 00:31:21,390
He will not appear!

572
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:24,190
Well, if he's a long-nosed goblin or a mountain hermit,

573
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:26,291
it may be a different story.

574
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:42,191
-Thief Kid! -Thief Kid!

575
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:47,891
It's Thief Kid.

576
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:51,391
He's appeared just now, as he has declared he would!

577
00:33:52,391 --> 00:33:53,790
Thief Kid!

578
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:55,190
He's come.

579
00:33:55,191 --> 00:33:56,790
He's really floating in midair?

580
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:58,090
It... it can't be.

581
00:33:58,091 --> 00:34:00,891
How and where on earth did he appear from?

582
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,190
Oh, no. It's started to rain.

583
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:07,390
Cover the equipment!

584
00:34:07,391 --> 00:34:08,391
Rain?

585
00:34:08,392 --> 00:34:10,590
Oh, no. It's raining.

586
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:12,590
What a time to rain.

587
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:14,190
Despite the sudden rain,

588
00:34:14,191 --> 00:34:15,991
the call for Thief Kid goes on!

589
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,390
Hey, what's the matter? Chopper no.7, hey?

590
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,590
What is it?

591
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:24,690
The image from chopper no.7 was suddenly cut off.

592
00:34:24,691 --> 00:34:27,890
This is chopper no.7. Everything's under control here.

593
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:31,990
The image probably temporarily went static due to the rain.

594
00:34:31,991 --> 00:34:34,290
No. Maybe Thief Kid

595
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:36,290
is making one of his henchmen send out jamming waves,

596
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,290
and is up to something again.

597
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:40,590
Does Thief Kid have henchmen?

598
00:34:40,591 --> 00:34:42,490
Yes.

599
00:34:42,491 --> 00:34:44,590
It is reported to be an aged man or a young lady

600
00:34:44,591 --> 00:34:46,790
or a lot of other characters.

601
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:49,690
But it's certain that he has at least one person helping him.

602
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:52,490
Hey, can you hear me, all men in the vicinity?

603
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:53,590
This is Inspector Nakamori!

604
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,790
Check on the double if there is anyone among the crowd

605
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:58,190
that is holding a jamming device!

606
00:34:58,191 --> 00:35:01,190
That person may be Thief Kid's henchman!

607
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:02,290
He's walking!

608
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:05,890
Just like last night, Thief Kid has begun walking!

609
00:35:05,891 --> 00:35:08,190
Advisor, please tell us what to do.

610
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:11,090
If things are left as is, he will surely steal the object this time!

611
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:13,890
I'm not going to let him steal anything right before my eyes.

612
00:35:13,891 --> 00:35:16,690
Put the Blue Wonder inside for now!

613
00:35:16,691 --> 00:35:17,691
Yes, sir.

614
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:20,190
It's his intelligence against mine.

615
00:35:20,191 --> 00:35:22,790
Scratch, preconceived ideas,

616
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:23,991
wind.

617
00:35:25,091 --> 00:35:26,491
Henchman.

618
00:35:28,491 --> 00:35:30,990
I see. That's the story.

619
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:33,090
I've figured it out, Thief Kid.

620
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:36,790
The trick that you used to appear in midair, walk and vanish.

621
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:41,491
I've also figured out how you plan to steal Blue Wonder now, too.

622
00:35:42,191 --> 00:35:43,390
Advisor,

623
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,790
we've completed putting Blue Wonder back inside the museum!

624
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:49,390
Okay, we're taking the initiative from here.

625
00:35:49,391 --> 00:35:52,791
Turn off all the lights inside the museum right away!

626
00:35:53,891 --> 00:35:55,190
All the lights?

627
00:35:55,191 --> 00:35:56,290
Yes.

628
00:35:56,291 --> 00:36:01,290
He could be monitoring the image within the museum, right?

629
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:03,290
Hey, doing something like that

630
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:05,490
is just what Thief Kid would love you to do.

631
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:08,490
Then, Inspector Nakamori, do you have a better idea?

632
00:36:08,491 --> 00:36:11,490
Do you know how to stop the great thief

633
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:13,390
who has appeared out of nowhere as would a mountain hermit,

634
00:36:13,391 --> 00:36:17,590
and close in on us walking in midair?

635
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:21,390
But just what do you plan to do turning off the lights of the museum

636
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:22,790
and taking the treasure inside?

637
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:26,390
In other words, the point is preventing him from stealing it.

638
00:36:26,391 --> 00:36:28,590
If the Miracle of the Ocean, Blue Wonder

639
00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:32,090
stays out of his reach, I win.

640
00:36:32,091 --> 00:36:33,690
I'd like to make a proposal.

641
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,190
In exchange for giving you complete command of this situation,

642
00:36:36,191 --> 00:36:39,990
I would like you to lend me a few of your men who can be trusted.

643
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:41,490
My men?

644
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,190
I'm accepting his challenge.

645
00:36:43,191 --> 00:36:46,790
It's a secret strategy that I stayed up all night thinking up.

646
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:48,890
My dear Thief Kid!

647
00:36:48,891 --> 00:36:52,790
My dear Thief Kid, my dear Thief Kid!

648
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:55,090
The helicopters have finally gone to the other side

649
00:36:55,091 --> 00:36:56,990
giving me a good view of him, and with the wind out of my way,

650
00:36:56,991 --> 00:36:59,690
I get an even better view.

651
00:36:59,691 --> 00:37:01,691
But too bad he's so far away.

652
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:03,591
What the...

653
00:37:03,592 --> 00:37:08,490
Thief Kid's less than 100 meters from his object of target Blue Wonder.

654
00:37:08,491 --> 00:37:11,290
Hey, how're things on your side?

655
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:13,290
Perfect.

656
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:16,491
I'm sure that your strategy will outfox Thief Kid.

657
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:20,590
He may be wiretapping us,

658
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:22,390
so that's enough.

659
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:24,290
There's nothing to worry about,

660
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:25,990
the tricks are more than well set!

661
00:37:25,991 --> 00:37:28,691
All we do is watch how everything turns out.

662
00:37:30,191 --> 00:37:31,490
Hey, wait a minute!

663
00:37:31,491 --> 00:37:32,990
Inspector!

664
00:37:32,991 --> 00:37:35,690
There's something strange about Thief Kid this time.

665
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:37,890
What is it?

666
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:40,290
You see something that looks like a string?

667
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,291
Really?

668
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,390
Yes, a thing that looks like a thin string

669
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:45,190
is shining at his shoulders.

670
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:49,890
Hey, if that's true, then Thief Kid's not walking

671
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:52,190
but rather is being suspended from the helicopter?

672
00:37:52,191 --> 00:37:54,390
Isn't there something strange about Thief Kid?

673
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:58,190
His legs are moving but it looks like he's being suspended to something.

674
00:37:58,191 --> 00:38:01,590
Hey, chopper no.7 that is right above Thief Kid's head, respond!

675
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:04,691
Chopper no.7. Hey, chopper no.7?

676
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:15,190
He vanished. Thief Kid vanished right near the museum just now!

677
00:38:15,191 --> 00:38:17,190
It's chopper no.7 after all!

678
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:19,290
His henchman that was on board chopper no.7

679
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:22,690
picked him up from within the curtain of smoke!

680
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:26,290
Hey, I hope all your choppers are numbered?

681
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,490
Yes, sir. Near the tail.

682
00:38:28,491 --> 00:38:31,390
All the choppers patrolling the sky, do you hear me?

683
00:38:31,391 --> 00:38:33,290
This is Inspector Nakamori from the Metropolitan Police Department!

684
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:36,290
Thief Kid is on board chopper no.7 with his accomplice!

685
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:38,390
Report the position of chopper no.7 immediately!

686
00:38:38,391 --> 00:38:40,390
Surround it until the police choppers arrive

687
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:42,091
and don't let them get away!

688
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:46,490
This is chopper no.14. Chopper no.7 verified

689
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,590
to be waiting at the main entrance of the museum!

690
00:38:48,591 --> 00:38:51,390
Okay! Keep an eye on it and continue the pursuit.

691
00:38:51,391 --> 00:38:52,890
Roger.

692
00:38:52,891 --> 00:38:54,290
This is chopper no.35,

693
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:57,090
chopper no.7 is currently right above Shiodome Park.

694
00:38:57,091 --> 00:39:01,390
Hey, hold it! Shiodome Park is behind the museum, isn't it?

695
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:02,990
Chopper no.28 here,

696
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:05,790
chopper no.7 has gone a long distance off from Shiodome.

697
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:08,390
This is chopper no.9. I verify two chopper no.7s

698
00:39:08,391 --> 00:39:09,790
in the foreground of Shiodome Park!

699
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:12,390
Hey, what the hell is going on?

700
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:15,090
Well, the number "7" is written on almost

701
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:16,990
all the tails of the helicopters around!

702
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:19,490
Thief Kid probably did this beforehand.

703
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:22,090
Idiot! That can't be.

704
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:23,590
If such a thing were to be done,

705
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:25,291
somebody would've noticed when boarding the craft!

706
00:39:26,391 --> 00:39:28,391
Inspector!

707
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:30,690
What is it?

708
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:32,090
There are strange silhouetted figures

709
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:33,690
in front of the entrance of the museum,

710
00:39:33,691 --> 00:39:35,791
not just one or two figures.

711
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:38,090
They're the subordinates

712
00:39:38,091 --> 00:39:40,790
that I let into the building a while ago.

713
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:43,790
Don't tell me that Blue Wonder is in the case

714
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:45,390
that the officer in the middle is holding?

715
00:39:45,391 --> 00:39:47,090
Just what do they think they're doing?

716
00:39:47,091 --> 00:39:50,391
It's like they're letting him know that he is carrying it.

717
00:39:51,991 --> 00:39:53,290
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

718
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,590
Get in right this minute!

719
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:56,590
Don't worry, sir.

720
00:39:56,591 --> 00:39:59,890
This case is empty anyway, and we're just decoys.

721
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:01,490
Decoys?

722
00:40:01,491 --> 00:40:04,190
Blue Wonder was taken out

723
00:40:04,191 --> 00:40:06,790
from the back door of the museum in a trash bag

724
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:08,691
by Jirokichi Suzuki disguised as a sanitation man.

725
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:22,190
What's so funny?

726
00:40:22,191 --> 00:40:24,990
Thief Kid.

727
00:40:24,991 --> 00:40:26,890
What a crazy thing to say?

728
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:31,190
I laughed because I was able to protect that treasure from Thief Kid.

729
00:40:31,191 --> 00:40:33,890
You idiot. I saw right through you

730
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:37,590
the minute you came to the museum today on this motorbike.

731
00:40:37,591 --> 00:40:41,590
Just like now, you didn't have your goggles on earlier.

732
00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:43,690
It would be pretty difficult

733
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,990
for one wearing contact lens to ride a motorbike without goggles.

734
00:40:45,991 --> 00:40:48,990
The wind would hurt your eyes and you'd be in tears.

735
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:50,390
That is, even if you had a windshield,

736
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:53,190
it would be difficult to ride a motorbike.

737
00:40:53,191 --> 00:40:54,990
Well, despite being super-rich,

738
00:40:54,991 --> 00:40:57,890
the old man goes riding around on this flashy motorbike

739
00:40:57,891 --> 00:40:59,990
without any bodyguards.

740
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,090
You'd have had more than enough opportunity to put him to sleep somewhere

741
00:41:02,091 --> 00:41:04,390
and switch places with him.

742
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:07,590
By the way, you took the dog Lupin that was riding in this sidecar

743
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:10,390
to a shade in Shiodome Park.

744
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:12,390
I'm pretty sure it's still asleep though,

745
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:14,991
because of the sleeping drug you made it sniff.

746
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:18,990
How could I be Thief Kid?

747
00:41:18,991 --> 00:41:21,690
I was right beside you

748
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:23,990
when Thief Kid appeared just a while ago, too.

749
00:41:23,991 --> 00:41:28,690
The same goes for last night when he miraculously walked in midair.

750
00:41:28,691 --> 00:41:31,290
That was no miracle.

751
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:35,290
It's a simple trick that can easily be carried out with an assistant.

752
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:37,590
Although the men are efficient members of the Suzuki Financial Group,

753
00:41:37,591 --> 00:41:39,490
they're not from the police or the military.

754
00:41:39,491 --> 00:41:41,290
It shouldn't be too hard to mix one of your men

755
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:46,090
among the bunch of professionals that were hired on a temporary basis.

756
00:41:46,091 --> 00:41:50,590
You suddenly appeared last night in midair between the buildings

757
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,790
and brushed away our doubts about you having been suspended by something

758
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:56,590
by making a helicopter pass over your head.

759
00:41:56,591 --> 00:41:59,890
After that, when the police and I ran up to the roof of the building,

760
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:01,590
all you had to do was make us confirm

761
00:42:01,591 --> 00:42:03,790
that there were no wires connected between the buildings.

762
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:04,791
Since it would really make it look

763
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:06,890
as if you were floating in the air.

764
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:09,490
But if the pilot of the helicopter that flew over your head

765
00:42:09,491 --> 00:42:11,790
were your assistant,

766
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:13,690
it's super easy to explain.

767
00:42:13,691 --> 00:42:15,690
First of all, you fly on board the helicopter,

768
00:42:15,691 --> 00:42:18,390
over to the two buildings you'll be using to carry out your trick,

769
00:42:18,391 --> 00:42:20,090
and hook the tip of one side of the wire

770
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:22,990
onto the roof of one of the buildings.

771
00:42:22,991 --> 00:42:26,690
Then, with the helicopter, you land on the roof of the other building,

772
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:28,990
hooking the wire onto the roof of that building.

773
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,990
You connect the wires from one building to the other,

774
00:42:30,991 --> 00:42:32,990
then use the pulley that is attached to your body,

775
00:42:32,991 --> 00:42:34,890
and move to the center.

776
00:42:34,891 --> 00:42:36,790
Then you take off the black outfit you were wearing

777
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:39,091
together with the curtain of smoke, and dispose of it.

778
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:41,691
Then Thief Kid appears!

779
00:42:42,491 --> 00:42:44,290
Your henchman comes immediately with the helicopter

780
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:45,990
and flies over your head.

781
00:42:45,991 --> 00:42:48,690
The fish line-like thin wire that you connected yourself

782
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,190
to the helicopter with before getting off,

783
00:42:51,191 --> 00:42:53,790
is pulled until it is taut and wound up!

784
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:56,590
After that you removed the pulley from your body

785
00:42:56,591 --> 00:42:58,190
and made the helicopter swiftly collect the wire

786
00:42:58,191 --> 00:43:00,490
that you hooked onto both buildings.

787
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:03,390
As a result, it would look as if you're floating in midair,

788
00:43:03,391 --> 00:43:06,290
whether viewed from the top of the side.

789
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:08,690
Then, all that's left for you to do is to pretend

790
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:10,990
to walk together with the helicopter as it moves forward.

791
00:43:10,991 --> 00:43:15,590
You used a tape recorder to create the sound of footsteps,

792
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:20,090
matching the sound from it with your stride.

793
00:43:20,091 --> 00:43:22,590
In order to deceive people from thinking that you're being suspended,

794
00:43:22,591 --> 00:43:25,590
you used exquisite body performance.

795
00:43:25,591 --> 00:43:27,490
After walking a while, together with the curtain of smoke,

796
00:43:27,491 --> 00:43:29,790
you abandoned your white clothes

797
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:31,290
and moved the position of the searchlight.

798
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,990
The helicopter pulls you up on board,

799
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:36,190
so it looks as if you vanished in midair.

800
00:43:36,191 --> 00:43:39,090
Well, tonight's Thief Kid was merely a walking doll

801
00:43:39,091 --> 00:43:41,590
that caught the attention of the police.

802
00:43:41,591 --> 00:43:43,290
You were probably just pulling the doll in and out of the helicopter

803
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:44,590
together with the curtain of smoke.

804
00:43:44,591 --> 00:43:45,790
All it was doing was hanging in the air,

805
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,690
so it was more than obvious that it was just a doll.

806
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,990
But, sonny you already climbed the building

807
00:43:49,991 --> 00:43:51,790
that Thief Kid was on, didn't you?

808
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:53,590
If something was suspended from the helicopter,

809
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:56,690
no matter how thin the string, it would've been seen.

810
00:43:56,691 --> 00:43:59,890
No, because of preconceived ideas and the wind.

811
00:43:59,891 --> 00:44:02,290
Talk about wretched.

812
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:04,690
The moment the helicopter flew above your head,

813
00:44:04,691 --> 00:44:07,890
I was convinced that you weren't being suspended.

814
00:44:07,891 --> 00:44:11,090
I was flustered when I didn't find the wire on the roof,

815
00:44:11,091 --> 00:44:13,690
and didn't notice that string.

816
00:44:13,691 --> 00:44:15,690
But, the marks were surely left behind

817
00:44:15,691 --> 00:44:17,390
on the roofs of the two buildings.

818
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:19,290
The marks left behind by the hooks that you hooked on beforehand,

819
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:22,690
when the wires were collected by the helicopter.

820
00:44:22,691 --> 00:44:23,990
But sonny,

821
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:27,390
you saw the video of Thief Kid last night again and again, didn't you?

822
00:44:27,391 --> 00:44:29,290
Although it also depends on the resolution,

823
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,790
if the string is as thin as a fishing line,

824
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:32,890
you would have to be very near and view it with the naked eye.

825
00:44:32,891 --> 00:44:35,690
It'd be virtually impossible to view it on the monitor.

826
00:44:35,691 --> 00:44:38,390
The only way the string would show is the down shot image

827
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:40,190
of Thief Kid when the string comes to the foreground,

828
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:41,890
and the only one who could've filmed this

829
00:44:41,891 --> 00:44:43,090
is helicopter no.7 piloted by your henchman.

830
00:44:43,091 --> 00:44:45,490
If you sent the image that was previously

831
00:44:45,491 --> 00:44:47,590
used for airing a special program on the museum,

832
00:44:47,591 --> 00:44:49,590
and you added the image of Thief Kid onto it

833
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:53,990
and made it look as if helicopter no.7 sent it,

834
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,990
the string wouldn't be there.

835
00:44:55,991 --> 00:44:57,890
That's why when it began to rain,

836
00:44:57,891 --> 00:45:01,090
your henchman stopped sending the image, right?

837
00:45:01,091 --> 00:45:02,690
Because on the aerial image back then,

838
00:45:02,691 --> 00:45:06,190
there was no one using umbrellas!

839
00:45:06,191 --> 00:45:08,290
The flashy demonstration you put on last night

840
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:09,990
was to make everyone think that you were coming from the sky,

841
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:11,790
and loosen the tight security on the ground.

842
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:13,290
You probably did so since you planned to disguise yourself

843
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:16,790
as Jirokichi Suzuki and come through with no check.

844
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:18,390
But, you goofed,

845
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:21,090
when you came with no goggles on

846
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:23,490
and that image was clearly on the TV screen.

847
00:45:23,491 --> 00:45:26,590
No, it's not that I came with no goggles,

848
00:45:26,591 --> 00:45:28,591
rather, I couldn't put them on.

849
00:45:29,691 --> 00:45:31,890
Because my disguise would come off!

850
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:35,190
Aren't you worried about your comrade that's on board helicopter no.7?

851
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:38,990
I'm sure the police have surrounded his craft by now.

852
00:45:38,991 --> 00:45:43,090
No need to worry, because the police are probably panicked.

853
00:45:43,091 --> 00:45:45,390
They're probably flustered by all the no.7 stickers

854
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:46,790
on the helicopters.

855
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:48,690
All the stickers?

856
00:45:48,691 --> 00:45:50,090
I see.

857
00:45:50,091 --> 00:45:52,690
You stuck the stickers of the real numbers

858
00:45:52,691 --> 00:45:55,890
of the helicopters over the no.7 stickers.

859
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:57,690
But the stickers of the real numbers were pasted on very lightly

860
00:45:57,691 --> 00:45:59,590
so that the wind would easily blow them off.

861
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:00,591
Yes.

862
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:05,090
Therefore, the pilots of the helicopters go on board

863
00:46:05,091 --> 00:46:07,790
totally unaware that they would be mistaken for being my henchman

864
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:09,190
and chased around.

865
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:12,290
In the meantime, my comrade splits amidst the commotion.

866
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:16,890
Indeed the great escape of the miracle of the vast sky, Blue Wonder!

867
00:46:16,891 --> 00:46:18,090
The vast sky?

868
00:46:18,091 --> 00:46:21,290
The blue of Blue Wonder is the blue of the ocean, you know.

869
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:22,790
It's the same thing.

870
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:26,390
The blue of the ocean is the reflection of the blue of the sky, right?

871
00:46:26,391 --> 00:46:28,690
It's the same as the detective and the thief.

872
00:46:28,691 --> 00:46:30,790
We seem as different as are heaven and earth.

873
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:31,791
However, if we trace back to the root of the matter,

874
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:34,390
we both force open the door to what people want to keep secret,

875
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,790
using the key of curiosity.

876
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:38,190
We're both nothing more than two rude men.

877
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:41,390
You idiot. The sky and the ocean are blue

878
00:46:41,391 --> 00:46:43,090
due to totally different qualities of the dispersion

879
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,890
and reflection of light.

880
00:46:45,891 --> 00:46:47,590
They're not to be thought of as the same!

881
00:46:47,591 --> 00:46:50,590
As proof of that, the water in puddles is not blue, is it?

882
00:46:50,591 --> 00:46:52,790
What a drab, wet blanket. You've got no dream.

883
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:56,590
I can't see through the truth chasing after dreams, you see.

884
00:46:56,591 --> 00:47:00,590
Are you really thinking of nabbing me with that tranquilizer gun?

885
00:47:00,591 --> 00:47:03,990
If I fall asleep at this speed, we're going to have an enormous crash.

886
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:07,290
Don't worry, I won't shoot until this motorbike stops.

887
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,990
And, as for your custody, I already contacted Inspector Nakamori,

888
00:47:08,991 --> 00:47:11,290
who should be on his way here.

889
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:13,090
I'm not stopping.

890
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:16,491
Beside, remember what Gramps Jirokichi was bragging about?

891
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:21,991
This motorbike is rigged with an acceleration function.

892
00:47:23,991 --> 00:47:25,890
See you, great detective.

893
00:47:25,891 --> 00:47:28,090
I'll leave that treasure to you.

894
00:47:28,091 --> 00:47:31,090
I wasn't after that treasure, to begin with.

895
00:47:31,091 --> 00:47:34,391
Besides, all I did was take him on because he challenged me.

896
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:12,391
That punk.

897
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:48,790
You've got no dream.

898
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:50,991
Idiot. Of course, I do.

899
00:48:54,091 --> 00:48:57,691
I've got dreams I want to realize too, you know.

900
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:05,390
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Uncle Jirokichi is angry at Conan now?

901
00:49:05,391 --> 00:49:06,990
Right.

902
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:10,290
Why? Conan's the one who protected the treasure, right?

903
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:12,090
So, this is why.

904
00:49:12,091 --> 00:49:16,291
That brat. How dare he take away the headlines from me.

905
00:49:19,891 --> 00:49:23,890
"Next Episode" -If I keep believing, he'll come back.

906
00:49:23,891 --> 00:49:26,390
It can't be. There's something wrong.

907
00:49:26,391 --> 00:49:28,490
It's impossible for her lover

908
00:49:28,491 --> 00:49:29,491
to have killed her.

909
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:32,090
Next Conan,

910
00:49:32,091 --> 00:49:34,891
"Illusionary Spring Lover."

911
00:49:50,191 --> 00:49:53,090
Next Conan's Hint:

912
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:54,991
"A Meal For Two"
