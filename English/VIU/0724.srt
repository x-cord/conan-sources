1
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:07,913
Happy New Year.

2
00:00:07,913 --> 00:00:10,813
Although I've kept you worrying all this time,

3
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:15,113
since I've changed back to my original self this year,

4
00:00:15,113 --> 00:00:19,013
I will solve case after case

5
00:00:19,013 --> 00:00:22,113
as a high school detective from now on...

6
00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:24,013
Just what do you think you're doing?

7
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:28,513
I'm Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.

8
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:30,013
I with my childhood friend, Ran...

9
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:31,513
Hey!

10
00:00:33,913 --> 00:00:35,213
What?

11
00:00:35,213 --> 00:00:37,513
Oh, no...

12
00:00:37,513 --> 00:00:42,113
Thief Kid's disguise as Shinichi Kudo has been disclosed.

13
00:00:42,113 --> 00:00:46,213
Will he be able to safely make it through?

14
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:50,213
Or will he be beat up by her fist?

15
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:53,213
Watch what happens on the website.

16
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:54,613
"No, you can't!"

17
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:56,213
Let me try again.

18
00:00:56,213 --> 00:01:00,613
Happy New Year...

19
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:03,013
Thanks to all you viewers out there,

20
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:05,413
we did great on TV as well as in the movies last year.

21
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:06,613
At the end of the year,

22
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:10,113
the movie in which we collaborated with the thief was shown.

23
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:12,913
It was a very good year!

24
00:01:12,913 --> 00:01:15,213
And this year...

25
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:18,313
Congratulations to the 20th anniversary

26
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:21,913
of the Detective Conan series...

27
00:01:21,913 --> 00:01:27,313
Therefore, we, the cast of this series

28
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:30,813
will sharpen up even more,

29
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:34,813
so we hope for your never changing continued support...

30
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:53,013
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

31
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,013
are slashed by the light of deduction.

32
00:01:55,013 --> 00:01:56,813
The sparkling red diamond that Kid goes after.

33
00:01:56,813 --> 00:01:58,813
Solve the mystery of the gorgeous and elegant trick.

34
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:00,413
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:02,513
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:05,113
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:39,006
"Thief Kid and the Blushed Mermaid (Part 1)"

38
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:42,806
Due to the auspices of Advisor Jirokichi's

39
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,606
to capture Thief Kid,

40
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:48,606
he decides to specially run the Bell Tree Express.

41
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:52,306
However, in order to kill Sherry, alias Ai Haibara,

42
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:55,206
the men in black raid the train.

43
00:03:57,006 --> 00:03:58,606
The train is blown up.

44
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:01,006
Thief Kid who had snuck onto the train to look around it beforehand,

45
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:02,906
also gets messed up in the incident.

46
00:04:04,206 --> 00:04:07,606
Just what do you mean, Superintendent Chaki?

47
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:10,306
Because of the Bell Tree Express explosion incident the other day,

48
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:13,706
wasn't the gem exhibition supposed to be postponed

49
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:15,906
until the explosion incident is solved?

50
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:18,006
We did this because Advisor Jirokichi Suzuki

51
00:04:18,006 --> 00:04:19,706
strongly wanted to go through with it.

52
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:21,906
I think because he got hold of gems

53
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:24,306
that would serve as good bait to catch Thief Kid,

54
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,306
he didn't want to waste the opportunity.

55
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:28,506
Well, we, the police have also attained

56
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:31,906
an opportunity to nab Kid too.

57
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:34,506
But...

58
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,006
if that explosion was carried out

59
00:04:36,006 --> 00:04:39,506
to get in the way of exhibiting the gems,

60
00:04:39,506 --> 00:04:41,606
won't they repeat what they did again?

61
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:42,706
Nothing about the truth of the case

62
00:04:42,706 --> 00:04:45,406
has been grasped yet, you know!

63
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:49,006
Of course, it's unthinkable that Kid would try to get involved

64
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:50,906
in such a dangerous case again.

65
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:53,806
Wrong, it seems that Kid already sent

66
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:56,506
a forewarning of the crime to the advisor.

67
00:04:57,606 --> 00:05:01,106
He said that he'd come for the gem on the day it is premiered.

68
00:05:02,706 --> 00:05:06,206
He left a message for the police

69
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,306
saying to check every nook and cranny,

70
00:05:08,306 --> 00:05:11,006
so that the exhibition hall wouldn't be blown up this time.

71
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:16,206
Furthermore, the time of which the gems can be exhibited

72
00:05:16,206 --> 00:05:18,606
seem to be limited.

73
00:05:18,606 --> 00:05:21,106
Only for a limited period?

74
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:25,506
That rich man couldn't possibly be renting the gems and yet.

75
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:27,006
Come to think of it,

76
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:30,206
he hasn't shown us the real gem yet, has he?

77
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:33,506
No. He did tell me that he was going to exhibit it

78
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:36,206
inside a large glass case, though.

79
00:05:36,206 --> 00:05:40,406
According to the advisor, that gem...

80
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:47,506
moves around freely inside that glass case.

81
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:50,306
Moves around?

82
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:52,806
Why is that?

83
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:55,406
"Suzuki Museum"

84
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:57,606
Well, hear me... ladies and gentlemen!

85
00:05:57,606 --> 00:06:01,506
Here I have a can of coke!

86
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:03,506
As you can see it is squashed,

87
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:06,606
and there is nothing inside already.

88
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:09,906
With my psychic power...

89
00:06:15,506 --> 00:06:16,806
It's back to normal.

90
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:21,706
Of course if I rub it like this with my finger,

91
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:23,306
the pull tab also revives.

92
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:25,006
Huh? No joke.

93
00:06:25,006 --> 00:06:27,606
Coke is also inside too.

94
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:29,206
You're great, Sonoko!

95
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:31,506
-You're good! -Hey... how'd you do it?

96
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:33,506
Tell me!

97
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:35,306
No way. If things go as planned,

98
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:37,706
I'm planning to show this to Thief Kid tonight

99
00:06:37,706 --> 00:06:40,006
and surprise him, you see.

100
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:42,506
I don't think he'd be surprised at all.

101
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:45,506
Because see...

102
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,906
there's a black seal on your finger, Sonoko.

103
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:49,506
It's stuck on.

104
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:54,106
Besides two small holes are left on that can too.

105
00:06:54,106 --> 00:06:55,806
Huh?

106
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:57,506
True!

107
00:06:57,506 --> 00:07:01,806
Sonoko probably after removing half of the coke

108
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:04,206
from the hole that she opened with a drill,

109
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:08,706
squashed the can and covered the hole up with glue.

110
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:11,806
After that, to make it look as if the mouth of the can was opened,

111
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,006
stuck a black seal over it.

112
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:16,206
I get it!

113
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:19,106
If she shakes the can vigorously

114
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,206
when she wants to show that the can is completely empty,

115
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:24,306
the coke will foam because of carbonic acid gas,

116
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:25,506
and with the pressure from the gas,

117
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:27,206
the squashed can will return to its original state.

118
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:29,006
Then if she rubs the month of the can with her finger

119
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:31,606
and peels the seal off,

120
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:33,506
it will look as if the coke can completely returned

121
00:07:33,506 --> 00:07:36,006
to its original state, right, Conan?

122
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:39,706
Yep... I saw this magic on TV the other day, you see.

123
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:43,006
Ran, why'd you bring that cheeky brat along?

124
00:07:44,906 --> 00:07:48,006
But, Uncle Jirokichi's the one who invited him, right?

125
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:51,306
Saying that he wanted Conan over because he's a Kid killer.

126
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:54,106
I'm more surprised about Sera.

127
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,206
Huh?

128
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:58,206
You didn't seem a bit interested about Kid, and yet.

129
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:00,206
It's not that I'm not interested.

130
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:02,506
With Holmes had Professor Moriarty,

131
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:05,506
to Kogoro Akechi had the 20 faced monster,

132
00:08:05,506 --> 00:08:09,606
it's natural for a detective to have a mysterious rival.

133
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:13,006
Besides, I wanted to ask you about this hat

134
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:15,406
that you picked up in the Bell Tree Express too.

135
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:19,706
Huh? I found it on the floor of the corridor.

136
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:21,506
Then, did you see him?

137
00:08:21,506 --> 00:08:24,206
A man wearing black clothes and a black hat

138
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:25,306
with a burn on the right cheek of his face...

139
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:28,306
Oh! Shiro's daughter!

140
00:08:28,306 --> 00:08:29,806
I'm sorry about what happened

141
00:08:29,806 --> 00:08:32,206
on board the Bell Tree Express the other day.

142
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:39,206
Look at all this hustle and bustle!

143
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:42,306
Just as would be expected of Thief Kid's popularity!

144
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:43,706
While we're at it,

145
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:46,406
why don't we go take a look at the other exhibition rooms?

146
00:08:46,406 --> 00:08:47,906
Yes, sir!

147
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:07,106
That's terrific!

148
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:10,006
There's a lot of people around the glass case.

149
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:12,106
I mean, isn't that...

150
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:13,606
An aquarium?

151
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:15,406
Hey... don't tell me that...

152
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:17,106
That's right!

153
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:19,506
The thing that he's after is...

154
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:23,806
The gem that this turtle is carrying on its back,

155
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:27,806
the red diamond, the Blushed Mermaid!

156
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:30,806
Where...

157
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,006
True!

158
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,806
There's a gold necklace and all attached to its back!

159
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:41,106
There seems to be a lot of gems on its belly too, though.

160
00:09:41,106 --> 00:09:42,506
You mean you tried to exhibit

161
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:43,806
this approximately ten centimeter fully decorated turtle

162
00:09:43,806 --> 00:09:47,706
on board the first class compartment of the Bell Tree Express?

163
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:49,306
Exactly!

164
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:53,206
The aquarium is made of hard glass.

165
00:09:53,206 --> 00:09:57,106
Beyond is a concrete wall two meters thick.

166
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:58,806
The ceiling and walls on both sides

167
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,906
are made of special alloy.

168
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:05,106
Furthermore, if the prey swims around in the water,

169
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,606
so even the so-called Moonlight Magician

170
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,806
shouldn't be able to steal it.

171
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:12,306
It's gruesomely of bad taste.

172
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:14,806
The animal protection league's

173
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:17,106
probably gonna come down on his head.

174
00:10:17,106 --> 00:10:20,806
The fact is this turtle has a shady history behind it.

175
00:10:20,806 --> 00:10:22,406
You know about it, don't you?

176
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:25,606
The great Italian actress who died

177
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:27,806
in a marine disaster six months ago?

178
00:10:27,806 --> 00:10:30,306
This turtle is said to be Poseidon,

179
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:33,206
the turtle that she owned.

180
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:34,706
Poseidon?

181
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:35,806
That's right.

182
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:39,906
She was the owner of the Blushed Mermaid, you see.

183
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,906
But, why would she attach gems on a pet?

184
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:44,306
I heard that just before the ship sank,

185
00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:46,206
she desperately glued the gems onto the turtle,

186
00:10:46,206 --> 00:10:48,406
hoping that the turtle would be saved

187
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:52,506
and taken in by somebody.

188
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:54,006
It was a token of her gratitude

189
00:10:54,006 --> 00:10:56,006
as well as money for turtle food.

190
00:10:56,006 --> 00:10:58,606
A local fishermen found it afloat on the sea,

191
00:10:58,606 --> 00:11:00,206
along with the aquarium and all.

192
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:04,606
And for some lucky reason, it fell into my hands.

193
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:08,906
But did you have the gems properly appraised?

194
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:12,406
Yeah, but while appraising the gems,

195
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,306
the appraiser as bitten by the turtle.

196
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:18,706
Well, it seems that turtles shed

197
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:20,606
during the months of May to November,

198
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:23,106
so I was actually waiting for the gems to come off naturally

199
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:25,106
after the turtle shed,

200
00:11:25,106 --> 00:11:26,906
and then have the gems appraised.

201
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:29,006
But, I just couldn't wait.

202
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:30,606
I see.

203
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,406
So he wanted to have it out with Kid

204
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:35,906
while the turtle still had the gems on its body.

205
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:39,206
Hey! That's it for viewing the exhibitions!

206
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:42,206
All people other than authorized personnel leave this room!

207
00:11:44,906 --> 00:11:46,706
Stop dilly-dallying,

208
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,506
hurry and get out of here!

209
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:50,506
Who is he?

210
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:53,906
Inspector Nakamori of the second investigation division of MPD.

211
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:55,406
Second investigation division?

212
00:11:55,406 --> 00:11:57,406
Yep. It seems that he specializes

213
00:11:57,406 --> 00:12:00,206
with cases having to do with Thief Kid.

214
00:12:00,206 --> 00:12:01,506
Yes...

215
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:04,406
He's always around when Sir Kid's involved.

216
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:09,306
So, he's the guy that's always being outwitted by Kid?

217
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:10,306
It's hurt...

218
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:12,806
Hey, boy! Didn't you hear me?

219
00:12:12,806 --> 00:12:13,906
I ordered everybody but authorized personnel

220
00:12:13,906 --> 00:12:15,606
to get out of here, didn't I?

221
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:18,006
Oh, no, Inspector Nakamori.

222
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:20,706
Ms. Sera here is in the same high school as I am...

223
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,606
Besides, she's not a boy.

224
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:24,606
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

225
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:27,706
I just met the inspector for the first time today, you see.

226
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,606
Moreover, I'm sure he pinched my cheek

227
00:12:29,606 --> 00:12:33,306
to confirm whether I was Kid in disguise.

228
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:34,306
Right?

229
00:12:35,606 --> 00:12:37,906
She kicked his balls.

230
00:12:37,906 --> 00:12:39,906
She sure is a user of martial arts.

231
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:42,006
Seeing that you're cold sweating,

232
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:45,706
it seems that you're not in disguise either, eh, Inspector.

233
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:47,306
Hi there, Ran!

234
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:49,906
Dad! I thought you weren't coming?

235
00:12:49,906 --> 00:12:52,906
Well, I was watching the news you see,

236
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,006
and I couldn't stop myself from not coming.

237
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:58,506
Well, of course I was sort of worried about you too.

238
00:12:58,506 --> 00:13:01,006
Sort of?

239
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:03,206
He's the last thing I need.

240
00:13:03,206 --> 00:13:05,306
Just after I got the customers to all get out of here,

241
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:08,906
why do I have to let these amateurs watch all this?

242
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:12,506
You all stay put in the rear, okay?

243
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:14,006
Yes, sir!

244
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:17,406
Okay, so I'll go use the restroom now,

245
00:13:17,406 --> 00:13:19,006
since there's still 30 minutes to go before he shows up.

246
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,206
Oh, the restroom near here was crowded,

247
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:22,706
so I think it's better if you go to the one upstairs!

248
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:24,806
Roger!

249
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:27,106
Hey, you say it's crowded,

250
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,806
but when did you go to the restroom, Sonoko?

251
00:13:29,806 --> 00:13:32,506
When I was going around inside this building.

252
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:34,106
Didn't you notice?

253
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,206
Nope.

254
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:53,706
Kid...

255
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:57,106
Listen to that call for Kid.

256
00:13:57,106 --> 00:13:58,306
Yep.

257
00:13:58,306 --> 00:13:59,806
How many minutes more are there to go

258
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,606
before Sir Kid arrives?

259
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:03,706
Let's see.

260
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:04,806
Huh?

261
00:14:09,606 --> 00:14:12,206
Geez, what tight security.

262
00:14:12,206 --> 00:14:14,606
Yeah, this time, its perfect.

263
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:18,206
Including the 20 men on the second floor corridor,

264
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:20,706
we've got 100 armed men with searchlights

265
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:24,006
waiting in the passageway on the second floor with shining eyes.

266
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:26,506
Moreover, the lights have batteries attached to them.

267
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:29,806
There's no way they'll go out.

268
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:34,506
In other words, Kid won't be able to steal in the dark

269
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,406
even though he's good at it.

270
00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:49,206
-What? -No way!

271
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:50,806
Outta the way!

272
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:54,306
What?

273
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:56,906
He hid the aquarium!

274
00:14:56,906 --> 00:15:00,306
Is he planning to take the aquarium, carpet and all?

275
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:04,306
-Darn. -Three, two, one.

276
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:12,406
Sonoko, Sera, are you okay?

277
00:15:12,406 --> 00:15:14,206
Where's the gem?

278
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,006
No joke.

279
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:21,506
It's nowhere in sight.

280
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:24,506
But there's a card in the aquarium.

281
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:29,506
The shy mermaid vanished in foam and is now in my hands.

282
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:31,106
Thief Kid.

283
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:33,706
What the...

284
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:35,506
It can't be...

285
00:15:35,506 --> 00:15:37,306
How'd he do a feat like that

286
00:15:37,306 --> 00:15:39,106
under these circumstances?

287
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:45,106
The gem vanished along with the turtle?

288
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:47,206
That can't be!

289
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,206
Look for it!

290
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:51,006
It's got to be somewhere in this aquarium!

291
00:15:51,006 --> 00:15:53,106
Behind the rocks or inside the gravel!

292
00:15:53,106 --> 00:15:54,206
Yes, sir!

293
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:58,706
This is...

294
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:01,906
Thief Kid's...

295
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:03,406
What?

296
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:05,106
What does it say?

297
00:16:05,106 --> 00:16:08,506
I got a hold of the gem...

298
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:12,706
It says that if I don't believe it, to confirm.

299
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,806
What?

300
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:17,806
Unlock the wire net of the aquarium this minute!

301
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:19,406
Get the ladder ready!

302
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:22,006
I'll check it out myself!

303
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:37,006
How about it, uncle?

304
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:38,606
Uncle!

305
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:40,706
Is it there or not? Which is it?

306
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:44,906
No good...

307
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:46,606
It's nowhere.

308
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,006
That's ridiculous.

309
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:50,706
Darn!

310
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:52,706
Stay out...

311
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:54,306
Don't come in!

312
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,906
Get back...

313
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:07,006
"Thief Kid got the treasure!"

314
00:17:09,706 --> 00:17:11,906
Kid...

315
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,906
Darn! How dare the cheer a perp on.

316
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:18,106
I guess it can't be helped!

317
00:17:18,106 --> 00:17:20,906
The aquarium is made of hard glass.

318
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,406
Besides, on the ceiling and both sides of the aquarium,

319
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:26,806
a special alloy wire net was used to cover it and yet,

320
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:29,306
while it was blinded from view with the carpet,

321
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:30,606
the decorated turtle carrying the gem on its back

322
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:35,006
was perfectly stolen.

323
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:39,606
You... why do you know so much in detail about the aquarium?

324
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:42,306
I heard it on the news!

325
00:17:42,306 --> 00:17:44,506
But wasn't this a little too well done?

326
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:47,806
-Huh... -A transparent fishing line

327
00:17:47,806 --> 00:17:49,706
was attached to the carpet and it was pulled up.

328
00:17:49,706 --> 00:17:53,006
To think that a winch was rigged onto the lighting of the ceiling.

329
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:57,406
Didn't you check it?

330
00:17:57,406 --> 00:17:58,806
Oh, no, sir.

331
00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:00,406
Since we were told that the carpet

332
00:18:00,406 --> 00:18:02,706
and the lighting were changed a few days

333
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,906
before the aquarium was set up here.

334
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:07,606
What? A few days ago?

335
00:18:07,606 --> 00:18:10,706
Since there was a customer who spilled coke all over the carpet,

336
00:18:10,706 --> 00:18:12,206
I had the carpet changed,

337
00:18:12,206 --> 00:18:14,106
but, the interior furnishing employee who came to do that,

338
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:17,706
asked me if I didn't want to change the lighting

339
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:19,506
to match the color of the carpet.

340
00:18:19,506 --> 00:18:21,906
Since I was moving the other artworks

341
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:23,506
in this room into another room

342
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:25,506
in order to make space to exhibit the aquarium,

343
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:28,806
I figured that changing the interior wasn't a bad idea,

344
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:33,306
so I went for his proposal,

345
00:18:33,306 --> 00:18:34,606
but on second thought,

346
00:18:34,606 --> 00:18:36,906
the twosome that came from the interior finishing company

347
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:38,406
maybe were...

348
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:40,306
What do you mean maybe?

349
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:43,506
They were Kid and his accomplice!

350
00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:46,606
It's so obvious that this is the exhibition room!

351
00:18:46,606 --> 00:18:48,606
You really got no balls.

352
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:51,106
Complaining about bygones at this point.

353
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:53,006
What the...

354
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,806
Well, I guess we were beat this time,

355
00:18:55,806 --> 00:18:58,106
so let's move everything out of here...

356
00:18:58,106 --> 00:19:02,206
He's not here already anyway...

357
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:03,706
Maybe he just wants to make it look that way,

358
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:07,106
although he's still in this exhibition room?

359
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:08,306
What?

360
00:19:08,306 --> 00:19:12,706
Because Thief Kid always works in the dark

361
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:15,306
or vanishes in smoke, right?

362
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:17,406
But, this time the lights were left on,

363
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,406
and he hasn't even shown himself yet.

364
00:19:20,906 --> 00:19:25,206
If Kid really took the gem along with the turtle,

365
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,606
he should still be in here.

366
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:30,106
The riot police who were guarding the doors

367
00:19:30,106 --> 00:19:32,606
didn't make any funny moves either.

368
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:35,306
If so, I'd like to pinch the faces

369
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:37,706
of everyone who is here like I just did yours

370
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:41,706
to confirm whether Kid is under disguise as someone else.

371
00:19:41,706 --> 00:19:44,706
I feel sorry pinching girls,

372
00:19:44,706 --> 00:19:46,506
so why don't we get into several groups

373
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:49,506
and body check each other?

374
00:19:49,506 --> 00:19:51,406
Body check?

375
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:53,906
I'll bet that Kid would still have the turtle

376
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:57,206
with the gem attached to it, even now.

377
00:19:57,206 --> 00:19:59,106
Right, Conan?

378
00:19:59,106 --> 00:20:00,506
Yep.

379
00:20:00,506 --> 00:20:02,006
I guess so.

380
00:20:03,006 --> 00:20:04,706
Huh? Is it okay?

381
00:20:04,706 --> 00:20:08,506
If I join your group for the body check?

382
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:09,906
Of course.

383
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:13,106
I'll check you from head to toe.

384
00:20:13,106 --> 00:20:15,306
Then, who shall we begin with?

385
00:20:15,306 --> 00:20:17,206
Let's start from chronological order of our ages,

386
00:20:17,206 --> 00:20:18,606
so check me first.

387
00:20:18,606 --> 00:20:19,906
Chronological order of our ages?

388
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:21,906
What month were you born, Sera?

389
00:20:21,906 --> 00:20:25,906
I mean how do you know what day we were born?

390
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:28,506
Well, Sera is a detective, you know.

391
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:36,706
But, talk about flat boobs...

392
00:20:43,106 --> 00:20:45,006
I'm really sensitive there.

393
00:20:45,006 --> 00:20:46,806
Shut up, be quiet!

394
00:20:48,106 --> 00:20:50,606
I don't get it.

395
00:20:50,606 --> 00:20:53,106
All sides were surrounded by hard glass,

396
00:20:53,106 --> 00:20:54,306
plus the ceiling and both sides

397
00:20:54,306 --> 00:20:57,906
were covered with special alloy.

398
00:20:57,906 --> 00:20:59,406
Just how on earth could he have stolen it

399
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:00,906
in such a short time

400
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:03,506
when the aquarium was blinded from view with that carpet?

401
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:05,106
Search good and hard!

402
00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:08,306
Kid's card was in the aquarium!

403
00:21:08,306 --> 00:21:11,806
It could be that Kid is hiding somewhere too.

404
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:13,806
No.

405
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:17,806
The trick of putting the card in the aquarium is easy.

406
00:21:17,806 --> 00:21:18,806
All that needs to be done is to roll the card up

407
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:21,006
and tie it with a string that melts in the water.

408
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:23,106
Then pull the fishing line

409
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:24,906
that is tied to the string through the card,

410
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:27,206
put a pebble at the tip of the line.

411
00:21:27,206 --> 00:21:29,206
And hang it on to the lighting.

412
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:32,906
Then if it is rigged to fall using a remote controller,

413
00:21:32,906 --> 00:21:35,306
the card that had fallen will go through the wired net,

414
00:21:35,306 --> 00:21:37,706
while the string melts in the water

415
00:21:37,706 --> 00:21:41,006
and the card opens up, displaying the message on the card.

416
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:45,306
Well, if it were Sera, Sonoko, Pops and Inspector Nakamori,

417
00:21:45,306 --> 00:21:46,306
who were able to get near the aquarium

418
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,406
after they got wrapped up in the carpet?

419
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:51,306
And if it were somebody among the riot police

420
00:21:51,306 --> 00:21:53,306
that were standing in front of the aquarium to begin with,

421
00:21:53,306 --> 00:21:56,806
they would've probably been able to directly put the card inside.

422
00:21:56,806 --> 00:21:58,206
But back then...

423
00:21:58,206 --> 00:22:01,606
the one who made the most suspicious move was...

424
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:13,006
Ran.

425
00:23:38,506 --> 00:23:40,406
-"Next Episode" -Hey! Undress yourself!

426
00:23:40,406 --> 00:23:41,406
Huh?

427
00:23:41,406 --> 00:23:43,306
Hey! How is it over on that side?

428
00:23:43,306 --> 00:23:45,206
We've finished checking on this side too!

429
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:46,806
Sonoko?

430
00:23:46,806 --> 00:23:48,906
Are you all right, Sonoko?

431
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:50,306
I'm fine.

432
00:23:50,306 --> 00:23:52,306
I just felt a bit faint

433
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,906
because everyone here is so off the point.

434
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:56,306
There's just one person here

435
00:23:56,306 --> 00:23:59,106
that didn't go through a body check.

436
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:01,506
It's you! Thief Kid!

437
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:04,506
Next Conan,

438
00:24:04,506 --> 00:24:08,506
"Thief Kid and the Blushed Mermaid (Part 2)"
