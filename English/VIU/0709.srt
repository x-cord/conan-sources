1
00:00:05,758 --> 00:00:08,358
I didn't think that it wouldn't be around anymore.

2
00:00:08,358 --> 00:00:10,658
I hear they're going to build a condominium.

3
00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:13,258
Too bad, because it was a delicious diner.

4
00:00:13,258 --> 00:00:15,158
Too bad.

5
00:00:15,158 --> 00:00:17,558
Well, let's go, then.

6
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:18,658
Come to think of it,

7
00:00:18,658 --> 00:00:21,858
there are a lot of new buildings being constructed around here.

8
00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:23,558
Over there, too.

9
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:26,458
Yes, that used to be a sweet dumplings shop.

10
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:27,658
Over there, too.

11
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:30,358
There used to be an old apartment there.

12
00:00:30,358 --> 00:00:31,558
There, too.

13
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:34,058
That used to be a bookstore, I think.

14
00:00:34,058 --> 00:00:35,458
Over here, too.

15
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,458
Take a good look. They're renovating the place.

16
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,858
Over here, too.

17
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:42,258
What about here?

18
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:44,558
This was an old public bath house.

19
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:46,858
I came here a few times, too.

20
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:50,458
It looks like this place is going to be a facility for bathing.

21
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:51,858
Gosh.

22
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:54,558
If so, they should've just left it as is a bath house.

23
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:56,258
You can say that again.

24
00:00:56,258 --> 00:00:59,658
I guess that's what they call business.

25
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:01,858
But it's sort of sad to think that

26
00:01:01,858 --> 00:01:03,558
things from the past are disappearing.

27
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:04,958
I guess so.

28
00:01:12,158 --> 00:01:13,658
What's the matter?

29
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:22,058
Somebody, call an ambulance!

30
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:24,358
-Ran, get an ambulance! -Yes, sir.

31
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:26,458
Mr. Inomata's not here.

32
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:30,158
He was in the smoking room a while ago, so maybe...

33
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:31,158
Darn it.

34
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,958
Mr. Murase, hurry up!

35
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,458
Yes, sir.

36
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:49,958
Aiming for a 100% solution.

37
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,158
Clear all mysteries and codes.

38
00:01:52,158 --> 00:01:53,958
Shocking sound at a construction site!

39
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,858
An awesome deadly trick is schemed.

40
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:57,458
He sees through the one and only truth.

41
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,558
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

42
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:01,958
His name is Detective Conan!

43
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:48,191
"Unidentified Impact"

44
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:50,616
Okay, give me an outline of this case.

45
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:51,716
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:54,716
At about noon today, there was an accident

47
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:58,016
in which the pipes that are used as footings collapsed.

48
00:03:58,016 --> 00:04:01,116
The victim is Mr. Yuji Inomata, age 56.

49
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,616
He seems to be the owner of this site.

50
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:06,216
The cause of death is bruises all over his body

51
00:04:06,216 --> 00:04:07,616
due to being buried under collapsed pipes.

52
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:10,316
They say that it is most likely that he died instantly.

53
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,516
Inspector.

54
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:13,216
There was a trace on the band bunching the pipes together.

55
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:16,616
Someone deliberately making a slit on it.

56
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:18,016
I think would be reasonable to say that

57
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:22,216
this is a homicide rather than an accident.

58
00:04:22,216 --> 00:04:25,916
But I wonder why Mr. Inomata was there?

59
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,916
There was an ashtray under the pipes that were collapsed.

60
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,816
Maybe it was the smoking area or something?

61
00:04:31,816 --> 00:04:33,616
The smoking area?

62
00:04:33,616 --> 00:04:34,916
I see.

63
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,216
Come to think of it, there were cigarette butts

64
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:39,816
found at the feet of the victim.

65
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:43,116
Mr. Inomata was a heavy smoker.

66
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,216
Anytime he had time, he'd go to take a puff.

67
00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:49,516
They are people who were at the scene when the accident occurred.

68
00:04:49,516 --> 00:04:52,016
They're all personnel of this construction site.

69
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:56,416
He's Mr. Inomata's chauffeur, Mr. Masao Kaneda.

70
00:04:56,416 --> 00:05:01,216
He's Mr. Takeshi Nojima, the construction director of this site.

71
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:04,216
And he's Mr. Naoki Murase, an architect.

72
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:06,716
He seems to be in charge of designing this place.

73
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:10,716
Will you tell me your circumstances just before the accident?

74
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:12,916
Back then, I was told by Mr. Inomata

75
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:16,016
to go buy coffee or something for the guest.

76
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:19,916
I went to the vending machine behind the site to buy coffee.

77
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:23,616
When I got back, the pipes were collapsed.

78
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:26,416
Who was that guest?

79
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,316
It's me.

80
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:31,516
I came to talk out about details.

81
00:05:31,516 --> 00:05:33,516
Details?

82
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:35,716
Rather, I came to discuss

83
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:37,116
the concept of the setting of this place.

84
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:40,716
And while Mr. Kaneda was out buying coffee,

85
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,716
I decided to call my office.

86
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:44,816
During that time,

87
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:48,016
Mr. Inomata left for the smoking area to take a puff.

88
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:50,916
After a while, I heard a loud noise.

89
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,316
I looked towards the smoking area...

90
00:05:53,316 --> 00:05:55,816
I was on lunch break,

91
00:05:55,816 --> 00:05:58,116
so I was here at the office.

92
00:05:58,116 --> 00:06:01,316
Then, I heard a loud noise.

93
00:06:01,316 --> 00:06:04,216
So you all came here

94
00:06:04,216 --> 00:06:06,716
since you heard the loud noise, right?

95
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:09,916
No one saw the pipes was collapsing?

96
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:13,516
Is this an accident?

97
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:15,216
Or maybe...

98
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:19,216
We haven't put aside the possibility of homicide yet.

99
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:24,916
If I remember correctly,

100
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:28,016
Mr. Kaneda borrowed money from Mr. Inomata.

101
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:29,016
What the...

102
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:31,416
The other day, I heard Mr. Kaneda say

103
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:36,216
that if Inomata disappears, he can call it a wash.

104
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:38,016
Hey, hold on!

105
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:40,416
It's true that I did say that.

106
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:44,016
It was because I was a bit pissed back then.

107
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:45,916
What makes you think that I'd go as far as to kill somebody

108
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,316
just because of something like that?

109
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:50,916
I think you would.

110
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:54,116
If so, then you're just as prone to, aren't you?

111
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:55,816
You were arguing with Inomata

112
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:58,316
on whether to lower or higher the architectural fee, weren't you?

113
00:06:58,316 --> 00:07:00,916
That's right. You're the one who specified

114
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,616
that place to be the smoking area too, right?

115
00:07:02,616 --> 00:07:04,616
You specified that place so that you could

116
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:05,616
take your grudge out on Mr. Inomata, didn't you?

117
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:08,216
I have no grudge against Mr. Inomata.

118
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:10,216
Don't play dumb with me!

119
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:12,916
Mr. Kaneda, calm down.

120
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,016
Come to think of it, you're to be suspected too.

121
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:19,316
You were angry after Mr. Inomata turned

122
00:07:19,316 --> 00:07:21,916
your concept of the plan down many times.

123
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,216
No. I would never do that.

124
00:07:25,216 --> 00:07:29,116
Well, calm down, everyone.

125
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,916
At any rate, I didn't do it.

126
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:38,816
Inspector Megure.

127
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:41,916
From the blade of the knife that was found,

128
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,516
a band made of the same nylon

129
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:46,116
that was holding the pipes together was found.

130
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:47,916
Judging from the way the substance was stuck on,

131
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,016
there's seems to be no mistake

132
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:52,416
that the band was severed with this knife.

133
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,216
Good work.

134
00:07:56,216 --> 00:07:58,716
Well, so this is it.

135
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:00,516
The culprit is Mr. Kaneda.

136
00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:01,816
It's you.

137
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,516
Why me?

138
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,016
There's no use to play dumb.

139
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:07,916
This is yours, isn't it?

140
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,716
Your name is carved on it.

141
00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:14,316
After Mr. Murase went outside to receive a phone call,

142
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:16,816
you pretended to go out to buy coffee

143
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:19,016
and went around behind where the pipes were stored.

144
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:20,516
You used the knife that you had with you

145
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:24,416
to cut the band that was holding the pipes together.

146
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,816
And after the pipes collapsed,

147
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:28,816
you ran over to the site of the accident

148
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:30,016
as if you knew nothing of it.

149
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:32,916
-But I don't think that was possible. -What?

150
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:36,116
Because out of all the pipes that were bundled together,

151
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:40,016
only the pipes nearest to the smoking area were collapsed.

152
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:41,216
There seems to be no space

153
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:44,916
for anyone to hide in an arm's reach, you see.

154
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,716
And yet, if the band holding the pipes together

155
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:47,816
were cut from smoking area side,

156
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:49,816
it would be in clear view from Mr. Inomata.

157
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:51,216
First of all, the culprit would also be at risk

158
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:52,816
of being struck by the pipes.

159
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:54,816
-So... -Shut up!

160
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:57,116
The culprit somehow managed to follow through.

161
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:58,916
How he managed it?

162
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,416
At any rate,

163
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,416
there's no doubt that Kaneda is the culprit.

164
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,316
The knife at the site is immovable evidence.

165
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:09,816
Wrong. I lost it yesterday.

166
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:13,516
You can make up an excuse like that any way you want.

167
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:15,116
Then, Mr. Kaneda,

168
00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:16,316
would you please tell us about your knife

169
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:19,416
as well as some other details?

170
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,216
I don't mind.

171
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:23,116
But I'm telling you, I didn't do it.

172
00:09:23,116 --> 00:09:26,616
May I excuse myself to go to the restroom?

173
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:29,316
I would like to make a call to my office.

174
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:30,416
All right.

175
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,116
I'd like to also talk to you two later,

176
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:35,416
so please don't leave the premises.

177
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,116
Even from what the forensics came up,

178
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:47,716
there's no doubt about the fact

179
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:50,116
that the band was cut with that knife.

180
00:09:50,116 --> 00:09:52,516
But I wonder if anyone would risk doing something like that

181
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:54,716
knowing that he would also be endangering himself.

182
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:56,916
Besides, the sound back then...

183
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:03,616
This is...

184
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,516
Sir, what's this?

185
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:38,216
Oh, that?

186
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:41,116
That's the plan of the concept

187
00:10:41,116 --> 00:10:43,316
that Mr. Murase showed Mr. Inomata.

188
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:47,316
But he seems to have thrown it away after it was turned down.

189
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:49,016
Isn't that the tile picture

190
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,916
that was in the public bath that used to be here?

191
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,416
It used to be in the bath tub

192
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,616
and looked like there was a real carp inside.

193
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:58,316
The men's restroom. Men's restroom.

194
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:01,316
Conan, there you are.

195
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:03,616
Stay put because it's dangerous.

196
00:11:03,616 --> 00:11:06,216
Ran. I have to go to the restroom,

197
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:08,816
but Pops is in there now.

198
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:14,516
I'm so sorry to have to trouble you like this suddenly.

199
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:17,316
No problem at all.

200
00:11:17,316 --> 00:11:19,416
Thank you, director.

201
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:22,816
Conan, are you all right?

202
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,216
Are you all right?

203
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,916
I'm sorry that it's slippery here

204
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,316
since the floor's just been waxed.

205
00:11:28,316 --> 00:11:31,516
No, not at all. We're sorry for troubling you.

206
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:36,216
May I buy a bottle of tea at the vending machine?

207
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:38,016
Sure. I don't mind the least bit.

208
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:40,016
Go right ahead.

209
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,316
Huh? It's tepid.

210
00:11:44,316 --> 00:11:46,716
It's still being cooled, I guess.

211
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:47,916
See.

212
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,016
"Cooling" -That's true.

213
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:51,116
Huh?

214
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:54,716
Did the vending machine man come today?

215
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:58,716
No. We're not doing business today because of renovations.

216
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:00,616
Director, could I speak to you for a minute?

217
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,716
Yes, I'll be right over.

218
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:05,016
I'll have to go.

219
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,216
Come again and visit us after we open, okay?

220
00:12:07,216 --> 00:12:08,416
Sure.

221
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,916
Okay, let's head back then.

222
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,916
Hey, Conan.

223
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,016
You'll fall again, you know.

224
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:18,616
"Electrical room"

225
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,216
This is...

226
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,416
Conan. What's the matter?

227
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,716
Conan?

228
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:57,536
The fingerprints have been verified.

229
00:12:57,536 --> 00:13:01,336
The prints on the knife are undoubtedly Mr. Kaneda's.

230
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:07,336
Good work.

231
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:10,936
Then, we'll have Mr. Kaneda come with us to the station.

232
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:13,836
Why did it turn up like this?

233
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:17,836
May I return to the main office?

234
00:13:17,836 --> 00:13:19,036
Me, too.

235
00:13:19,036 --> 00:13:21,236
Well then, as to both of you,

236
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:23,236
we'll be contacting you again if necessary.

237
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,036
You may go for today.

238
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:26,836
Thank you.

239
00:13:26,836 --> 00:13:28,336
Is he going voluntarily?

240
00:13:28,336 --> 00:13:31,436
I'm sorry, but could you bring the car around?

241
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,136
Roger, sir.

242
00:13:34,536 --> 00:13:36,636
Officer Chiba.

243
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:38,736
What is it, Conan?

244
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:44,336
-Mr. Mouri? -Yes.

245
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:49,436
Hey, enough already.

246
00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:51,336
I didn't do it, I tell you.

247
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:55,336
We'll hear you out, all you want at the station.

248
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:02,236
Dad?

249
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:06,236
Please wait, everyone.

250
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:08,736
Mr. Kaneda is not the culprit.

251
00:14:08,736 --> 00:14:11,836
Just what're you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

252
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:14,136
His fingerprints were also found on the knife, you know.

253
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:17,936
Besides, you even said that he was the culprit.

254
00:14:17,936 --> 00:14:20,236
It's true I did say that,

255
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:23,936
but I'd like to revise all the deductions I made thus far.

256
00:14:23,936 --> 00:14:27,836
The culprit is among the people here.

257
00:14:27,836 --> 00:14:30,136
I thought it was strange

258
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:33,236
that the knife would be left behind at the site.

259
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:37,136
It's true that it's thinkable that the culprit may have dropped it.

260
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:40,236
But if so, what should also be here is missing.

261
00:14:40,236 --> 00:14:42,036
What should also be here?

262
00:14:42,036 --> 00:14:43,636
What is that?

263
00:14:43,636 --> 00:14:45,336
Please take another good look

264
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:48,836
at where the knife was found on the ground.

265
00:14:48,836 --> 00:14:51,436
Right near it is the ashtray.

266
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:53,936
Because of the pipes, it's totally crushed.

267
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,136
It smashed under the weight

268
00:14:55,136 --> 00:14:57,036
and sunk deep into the ground.

269
00:14:57,036 --> 00:14:58,736
That's true.

270
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:02,336
But what about the knife?

271
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:04,036
There's no sign of it being sunk in the ground.

272
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,536
Exactly.

273
00:15:05,536 --> 00:15:08,436
It's heavy enough to kill a person.

274
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:11,036
Therefore, it's hard to think that

275
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,936
there is no trace of the knife having sunk deep.

276
00:15:12,936 --> 00:15:15,736
What does that mean?

277
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:17,536
It was placed there by the culprit

278
00:15:17,536 --> 00:15:21,236
after the pipes collapsed.

279
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:22,436
What?

280
00:15:22,436 --> 00:15:24,236
Is that true?

281
00:15:24,236 --> 00:15:29,336
The culprit probably stole the knife from Mr. Kaneda last night.

282
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:35,136
He used it to inconspicuously slit the back side of the band.

283
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:38,136
Then, he banded the pipes a bit firmly together.

284
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:40,736
After confirming that Mr. Inomata began smoking

285
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:44,236
and Mr. Kaneda left the site,

286
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,636
the culprit also left.

287
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:51,436
Didn't the culprit cut the band with the knife?

288
00:15:51,436 --> 00:15:54,436
No. Because if he directly cut the band,

289
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:57,536
he would also be endangering himself.

290
00:15:57,536 --> 00:16:01,436
That's why the culprit used a certain something to cut the band.

291
00:16:01,436 --> 00:16:03,136
A certain something?

292
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:06,636
Please look at the next building behind me.

293
00:16:06,636 --> 00:16:08,736
You mean the amusement facility?

294
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:09,736
From the window on the second floor

295
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,336
of the prefab of the construction site,

296
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:13,836
you can see the emergency door next to it, can't you?

297
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:17,236
What about it?

298
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:18,336
Officer Chiba.

299
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:20,336
From what I confirmed,

300
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:22,636
the window of the 2nd floor of the prefab was open

301
00:16:22,636 --> 00:16:24,536
and it was possible to look straight at the pipes

302
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:26,736
from the amusement facility.

303
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,036
Don't tell me you're saying that the culprit

304
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:31,836
severed the band holding the pipes together from there?

305
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:33,736
No way.

306
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:36,236
Officer Chiba, please go ahead.

307
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:37,736
Yes, sir.

308
00:16:37,736 --> 00:16:40,236
The culprit operated the breaker

309
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:42,936
that is on the 1st floor of that building,

310
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:45,236
made a certain something on the 2nd floor move

311
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:47,536
and committed the crime.

312
00:16:48,536 --> 00:16:51,636
Mr. Mouri, what is that certain something?

313
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:57,836
This is...

314
00:16:57,836 --> 00:16:59,836
A pitching machine?

315
00:16:59,836 --> 00:17:02,136
Exactly.

316
00:17:02,136 --> 00:17:04,336
At around noon today when the incident occurred,

317
00:17:04,336 --> 00:17:07,136
the window of the prefab was open.

318
00:17:07,136 --> 00:17:09,236
When I confirmed further,

319
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,436
the amusement facility was undergoing renovation,

320
00:17:11,436 --> 00:17:14,336
so the door of the emergency door was also open.

321
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:19,036
Neither the nets nor the glass was set up yet.

322
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:21,536
In other words, at the time of the incident

323
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:22,536
from the site where the pipes

324
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:24,836
were to the pitching machine on the 2nd floor,

325
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,836
a path was formed.

326
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:32,236
The culprit probably set the pitching machine up beforehand

327
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:34,136
to throwing position

328
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,736
and turned down the breaker of the building.

329
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:40,136
After confirming that Mr. Inomata was in the smoking area,

330
00:17:40,136 --> 00:17:42,336
he turned the breaker back on.

331
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:52,436
In other words, the culprit used the impact of the ball

332
00:17:52,436 --> 00:17:54,936
going through a narrow path and made the pipes collapse

333
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:58,236
to kill Mr. Inomata.

334
00:17:58,236 --> 00:18:02,536
And the culprit who committed the crime probably...

335
00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:10,836
is you, Mr. Murase.

336
00:18:14,536 --> 00:18:16,336
You...

337
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:19,036
I hope you have evidence to back up what you're saying.

338
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:20,936
The evidence is your shoe.

339
00:18:20,936 --> 00:18:23,336
To be more exact, the sole of your shoe.

340
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,936
Ran, show me the sole of your shoe.

341
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:28,936
What? Mine?

342
00:18:30,636 --> 00:18:32,836
Okay.

343
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:34,836
What's this red yarn?

344
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:38,636
It's the yarn from the rug of the amusement facility, Funfun.

345
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:40,236
If the same thing found on Ran's shoe

346
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:42,036
is found on the sole of Mr. Murase's shoe,

347
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:46,036
it would be evidence that he went to Funfun.

348
00:18:46,036 --> 00:18:48,836
Excuse me, but will you show it to me?

349
00:18:50,636 --> 00:18:52,636
It's there.

350
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:55,436
But this is only circumstantial evidence, isn't it?

351
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:57,836
I won't have a mere yarn making me as a culprit.

352
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,936
It's natural that there's no concrete evidence.

353
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:04,736
However, it's certain that the trace of a ball was found,

354
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:07,836
together with the prints of Mr. Murase's shoes.

355
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:10,036
After running over to the scene of the crime,

356
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:12,236
you hid the ball that is evidence, didn't you?

357
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,136
Where's that proof?

358
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:16,736
Probably inside that debris?

359
00:19:16,736 --> 00:19:21,536
After all, Mr. Murase hasn't gone off the premises at all.

360
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:22,836
Officer Takagi.

361
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:24,236
Yes, sir.

362
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,436
I found it.

363
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:34,336
This is it, right?

364
00:19:34,336 --> 00:19:38,336
Why would Mr. Murase want to kill Mr. Inomata?

365
00:19:38,336 --> 00:19:42,036
Because your concept was turned down?

366
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:44,036
Wrong.

367
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:47,036
It's because...

368
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:49,036
I hated Inomata.

369
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:51,636
Up until now,

370
00:19:51,636 --> 00:19:54,436
he bought up land cheaply using ruthless methods.

371
00:19:54,436 --> 00:19:55,936
He established a large scale chain

372
00:19:55,936 --> 00:19:58,036
of multi-purpose bathing facilities.

373
00:19:58,036 --> 00:20:00,336
Among one of the lands that he bought at an extremely cheap price

374
00:20:00,336 --> 00:20:04,236
was my parental home's public bath house.

375
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:08,836
My mother fell ill because of this and died.

376
00:20:08,836 --> 00:20:13,036
My father committed suicide as if going after her.

377
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:15,736
But I didn't do it because I hated him for that.

378
00:20:17,836 --> 00:20:20,136
I found out that this construction site

379
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,236
was once a public bathing house

380
00:20:22,236 --> 00:20:24,536
and built in an architectural concept

381
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:27,636
hoping to at least leave a slight trace of what it used to be.

382
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:29,436
But he...

383
00:20:32,236 --> 00:20:34,636
He snickered saying that public bathing houses were out of date.

384
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,736
He remarked that there was no need

385
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:41,036
for such old fashioned and moldy things anymore.

386
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:44,236
He called me names.

387
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:48,836
A lot of memories...

388
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:54,636
of my Dad and I are packed in the public bathing house.

389
00:20:57,036 --> 00:20:58,936
All those memories, he had the nerve to...

390
00:21:06,736 --> 00:21:09,636
That's why I killed him!

391
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:10,936
All my precious memories,

392
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,736
he stepped all over them and crushed them.

393
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:14,936
That's why I killed Inomata.

394
00:21:17,436 --> 00:21:19,036
Mr. Murase.

395
00:21:19,036 --> 00:21:22,036
It's not that I don't understand how you feel.

396
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:24,336
However,

397
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:28,736
just because he stepped all over your memories and crushed them,

398
00:21:28,736 --> 00:21:33,236
it doesn't give you the right to kill anyone.

399
00:21:33,236 --> 00:21:34,936
Besides, Mr. Murase,

400
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:37,236
Mr. Inomata also has a family

401
00:21:37,236 --> 00:21:40,736
and I'm sure they had precious memories, too.

402
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:45,036
You destroyed their memories, you know.

403
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:17,336
Dad, hang in there!

404
00:23:17,336 --> 00:23:18,736
Shut up!

405
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:20,936
I'm trying to concentrate.

406
00:23:20,936 --> 00:23:26,236
I'll show you my ultra super technique now.

407
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,636
My hips!

408
00:23:36,936 --> 00:23:40,136
It sure is an ultra super technique all right.

409
00:23:42,436 --> 00:23:45,636
"Next Episode"

410
00:23:45,636 --> 00:23:47,036
What?

411
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:50,836
Homicide.

412
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:54,236
I'm telling you, no matter how you look at it, this is murder.

413
00:23:55,836 --> 00:24:01,636
Let's listen to what those three have to say again then.

414
00:24:01,636 --> 00:24:03,136
I'm sure they'd have no idea

415
00:24:03,136 --> 00:24:06,936
that they would be suspected at such an early stage.

416
00:24:06,936 --> 00:24:12,336
Next Conan, "Everyone Was Watching (Part 1)"

417
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:30,136
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,636
"Cleaning robot"

419
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:34,636
Appetite, sports and maple leaves bring to mind.

420
00:24:34,636 --> 00:24:37,136
-Beer! -Autumn, you idiot.
