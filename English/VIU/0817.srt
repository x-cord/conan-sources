1
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:09,702
I think there's no choice but to have her disappear after all.

2
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:11,902
Motoko, that is.

3
00:00:11,903 --> 00:00:13,302
"Shigemi Terakado (67), Spinster"

4
00:00:13,303 --> 00:00:15,702
The problem is after that.

5
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:19,302
How to get rid of the corpse?

6
00:00:19,303 --> 00:00:22,502
"Ryuji Matsuo (23)" -If you don't ever want anybody to find it,

7
00:00:22,503 --> 00:00:27,102
you could bury it in the remote mountains or something.

8
00:00:27,103 --> 00:00:31,602
I guess so but I'm not young anymore.

9
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:34,602
You can count on me to get rid of it.

10
00:00:34,603 --> 00:00:36,902
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

11
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,702
I hope you rest in peace.

12
00:00:38,703 --> 00:00:41,303
"Motoko Kawaguchi (25)" -Motoko Kawaguchi.

13
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:51,803
I'd like you to look for Motoko Kawaguchi for me.

14
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:57,702
"Haruki Toriumi (33)" -She's my fiancee but she suddenly disappeared.

15
00:00:57,703 --> 00:01:00,802
No matter how many times I call her cell phone, she won't answer.

16
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:02,602
Haruki Toriumi.

17
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:04,902
You mean, you're with Toriumi Conglomerate?

18
00:01:04,903 --> 00:01:06,802
Yes. Sort of.

19
00:01:06,803 --> 00:01:09,802
I'll be inheriting everything in time.

20
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:13,602
You're the successor of a famed family with a promising future.

21
00:01:13,603 --> 00:01:15,902
It's not that it means anything,

22
00:01:15,903 --> 00:01:20,102
but I fell in love at first sight with her.

23
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:23,702
For Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi who is nothing more than an ordinary person,

24
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:25,502
she's a gold digger.

25
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:29,302
It's unthinkable that she would throw all this away and disappear!

26
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:32,903
I'm sure Motoko got involved in some incident.

27
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:40,902
A canvas stained black with crime.

28
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:43,502
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

29
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,202
The fiancee suddenly disappears.

30
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:47,602
Sundown closes in on a dangerous conversation.

31
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:49,202
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:51,202
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:53,603
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:38,207
"The Fiancee who Disappeared"

35
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:42,684
But in an incident?

36
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:44,185
I wonder what it is.

37
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:48,484
How come you're here?

38
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:50,984
It's a school's off today.

39
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:53,784
That's the apartment, right?

40
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:55,184
Hey!

41
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:57,185
Don't go ahead of me!

42
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:02,584
I got a call from Kawaguchi three nights ago.

43
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:05,084
She said she had to move suddenly.

44
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:09,784
She told me that she couldn't to tell me where she was moving to.

45
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:14,484
She said that the movers would be coming to get her things.

46
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:17,984
"Katsuko Okubo (45)" -The following day, the movers came as she mentioned.

47
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:21,784
They took all her things with them.

48
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:25,284
The movers brought this key

49
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:27,784
and said that she had told them to return it to me,

50
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:32,684
so I didn't doubt them at all.

51
00:04:32,685 --> 00:04:35,984
But moving when the resident is not present...

52
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:38,385
It doesn't usually happen, does it?

53
00:04:40,685 --> 00:04:43,985
I see. I'm sorry to have intruded on you during your work hour.

54
00:04:47,185 --> 00:04:48,984
Same with her work place.

55
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:50,684
Likewise, three days ago,

56
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:52,684
she seems to have called her boss

57
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:54,584
and suddenly announced that was quitting.

58
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:58,384
Although she didn't say a word about it during the day.

59
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:01,984
So Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi suddenly disappeared

60
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:04,484
from her home as well as her work place.

61
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:06,584
What on earth happened?

62
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:08,384
Excuse me.

63
00:05:08,385 --> 00:05:09,884
Where's Motoko?

64
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:12,684
It seems that Motoko Kawaguchi moved.

65
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:14,684
"Kumi Suda (25)" -What?

66
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:16,584
She didn't say anything of that sort three days ago.

67
00:05:16,585 --> 00:05:18,184
Three days ago?

68
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:21,384
I'm a detective called Mouri.

69
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:24,584
I'm Hisami Suda, Motoko's friend.

70
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:28,784
Did you see Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi three days ago?

71
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:32,184
Yes. I ran into her in town at sundown.

72
00:05:32,185 --> 00:05:35,184
Did you notice anything strange back then?

73
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:36,484
What?

74
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:40,685
The whereabouts of Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi is unknown since that night.

75
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:46,384
But when I met her, she was her usual self.

76
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:51,484
She said that she was going to visit Ms. Shigemi Terakado while smiling.

77
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,584
Shigemi Terakado?

78
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:56,684
I hear she lives at the Beika residence.

79
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:58,784
She is an elderly woman living alone.

80
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:01,184
So, it seems Motoko goes to see her sometimes.

81
00:06:01,185 --> 00:06:04,684
Which means that Motoko's whereabouts became unknown

82
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:05,884
after she visited Ms. Terakado?

83
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:09,484
I'll try visiting Ms. Terakado, then.

84
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:11,985
Because she could be the last one who saw Ms. Motoko.

85
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:16,984
I hope we can find some clue.

86
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:21,284
Just how far are you going to tag along?

87
00:06:21,285 --> 00:06:23,684
Yes, how can I help you?

88
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:25,684
You're Ms. Shigemi Terakado?

89
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,884
I'm Detective Mouri.

90
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:32,084
A detective?

91
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:36,184
I'd like to ask you something about Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi.

92
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:39,684
I know her very well.

93
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:41,184
She saved my life.

94
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:43,884
It was a year ago.

95
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:46,384
You don't feel well?

96
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,984
Yes. I feel a bit faint.

97
00:06:48,985 --> 00:06:51,584
I'm old. So, it happens sometimes.

98
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:53,584
Where do you live?

99
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:55,085
I'll take you there.

100
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,584
Since then, she's always been looking out for me.

101
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:03,284
I'm very grateful.

102
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:06,684
But she hasn't been here for about a month now.

103
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:08,985
Didn't she come here three days ago?

104
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:13,484
Looks like the water's boiling.

105
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:14,984
May I go?

106
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:16,085
Sure.

107
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:22,084
So, she changed her schedule?

108
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:24,384
She twitched in surprise

109
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:25,984
when you introduced yourself as a detective, right?

110
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:28,884
Yeah. I wonder if she's into something fishy?

111
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:31,784
Aren't you the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri?

112
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,284
"Mitsue Uno (55)" -Yes, I'm indeed Mouri.

113
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:36,584
I thought so. You're the real him, aren't you?

114
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:40,984
I believe a young lady has been visiting your neighbor sometimes?

115
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:42,584
Is her name Kawaguchi?

116
00:07:42,585 --> 00:07:44,084
That's her!

117
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:48,184
She was here at sundown three days ago too.

118
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:50,684
She came here after all.

119
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:53,184
Yeah. Then, why did she say she didn't come?

120
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:58,384
Terakado was having a tough time with that person called Kawaguchi.

121
00:07:58,385 --> 00:07:59,884
Didn't she saved Ms. Terakado's life?

122
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:01,384
She said she was grateful.

123
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:02,584
Yes, in the beginning.

124
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:06,384
But each time she came, it seemed she asked for money.

125
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:07,385
-What? -What?

126
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,485
Even last week, I think it was...

127
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:14,984
That wicked woman!

128
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:19,084
You just wait, I'll give her a taste of her own medicine!

129
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:21,285
Oh, I was going to throw my trash away.

130
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:26,584
She hated Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi.

131
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:30,684
If you consider she was deliberately hiding that Ms. Motoko came,

132
00:08:30,685 --> 00:08:32,985
you can deduce more or less what happened.

133
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:37,884
Shigemi.

134
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:42,084
I'm sorry to have to ask you again but...

135
00:08:42,085 --> 00:08:44,185
It's just before pay day.

136
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:53,384
The problem is how do we prove it, right?

137
00:08:53,385 --> 00:08:55,784
So, what did she do with the corpse?

138
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,984
She couldn't leave it here for too long, could she?

139
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:02,185
But it'd be hard for an elderly lady like her to carry it out either.

140
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:17,184
He's Ms. Terakado's friend and comes sometimes.

141
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:18,884
Terakado's?

142
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:20,984
She said he's a mover.

143
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:22,484
-Mover? -Mover?

144
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:24,485
Oh, no, what a blabbermouth I am!

145
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:31,385
A convenient next door neighbor full of information, isn't she?

146
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:37,185
No, but that neighbor's not enough.

147
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:49,384
Yes, he's the one!

148
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:52,884
He's the mover who came to pick up Kawaguchi's things.

149
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,585
I knew it!

150
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:59,084
I've figured it out, all of it!

151
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:00,784
Pops.

152
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:02,984
Ms. Shigemi Terakado killed Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi

153
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:05,084
who kept ripping her off.

154
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:09,584
Then she pretended to be Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi and placed fake calls.

155
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:12,184
She called the apartment landlady saying she was going to move.

156
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:15,684
Then called her boss at work and told him she was quitting.

157
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:18,284
She did all this so that nobody would think it strange

158
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,084
even if Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi suddenly disappeared.

159
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:22,884
The one who helped her get rid of the body and all,

160
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:25,784
is that man friend mover of hers.

161
00:10:25,785 --> 00:10:30,284
He probably move the corpse by shoving it into a mattress bag

162
00:10:30,285 --> 00:10:33,084
and made it look as if Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi had asked him

163
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:35,684
to take all her belongings away,

164
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:38,884
to finish off the moving scheme.

165
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:42,284
This is the truth of this disappearance case!

166
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:45,184
Well, everything does fall into place, but...

167
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:47,384
That's why it's strange, right?

168
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:48,385
Strange?

169
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:50,784
Because the minute you start investigating this case,

170
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:53,784
her friend, Kumi Suda shows up.

171
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:57,884
We got to hear about Ms. Shigemi Terakado from Ms. Kumi Suda too.

172
00:10:57,885 --> 00:10:58,885
We come here

173
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:01,684
and find there's a neighbor who has a lot of information.

174
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:04,284
She gives us loads of information.

175
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:07,984
On top of that, even the mover appears.

176
00:11:07,985 --> 00:11:09,784
Everything's falling into place too much.

177
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:12,084
It looks like everybody's trying to get you to solve the case

178
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:14,084
as soon as possible, doesn't it?

179
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:15,784
They want you to conclude that

180
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:18,084
Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi was killed by Ms. Shigemi Terakado,

181
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:21,384
and the corpse was gotten rid of.

182
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:24,284
Now that you mentioned it.

183
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:25,884
So that means?

184
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,785
I guess. It's most likely.

185
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:32,884
Ms. Shigemi Terakado and Mr. Ryuji Matsuo,

186
00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:37,284
you both erased Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi from this world, didn't you?

187
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:40,384
Impressive! Well done, famed detective.

188
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:42,084
But unless you find the corpse,

189
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:45,084
you can't arrest us, can you?

190
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:46,784
Pops!

191
00:11:46,785 --> 00:11:48,385
I brought them.

192
00:11:51,985 --> 00:11:54,884
You guys didn't really get rid of her.

193
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:58,384
All four of you worked together to make it look that way!

194
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:02,084
So, you saw through our fake murder scheme.

195
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:06,384
We wanted to save Motoko from her fiancee, Mr. Toriumi.

196
00:12:06,385 --> 00:12:07,484
Yeah.

197
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:08,684
-Right. -Yes.

198
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:11,185
What do you mean save her from Mr. Toriumi?

199
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,378
In the beginning, Motoko was attracted to Mr. Toriumi too.

200
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:25,578
That's why she accepted his proposal.

201
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,978
But she couldn't handle his arrogant attitude of believing that

202
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:33,078
everything would work out the way he wanted it to,

203
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:36,478
so she asked him to break off the engagement.

204
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,479
But Mr. Toriumi...

205
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:41,778
It's too late.

206
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:45,978
I already introduced you as my fiancee to the people around me.

207
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:48,478
If we break off the engagement now,

208
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:51,578
what will people think of me?

209
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:54,678
I could never do something so embarrassing.

210
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:58,479
I don't care whether you love me or not.

211
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:06,778
So, Motoko was at a loss what to do.

212
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,378
She knew what kind of man Mr. Toriumi was,

213
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:10,678
so she said that no matter where she fled,

214
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,878
he would use his money and power to find her and bring her back.

215
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,178
She said that she would never be able to run from him

216
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:23,578
There are guys like that who are dreadfully selfish like him.

217
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:27,678
That's why you all thought up a plan to rescue Ms. Motoko from him?

218
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:34,178
So, I got Ryuji, who helped Motoko and I a year ago, to join us too.

219
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:37,678
And that's how we came up with this fake murder plan.

220
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,678
If you made it look as if she was murdered and buried somewhere,

221
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,878
you figured that even a guy like him would give up, right?

222
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,678
Motoko starts a new life in some town far away.

223
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,778
We thought that this would really work.

224
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,978
And when Motoko disappeared.

225
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:55,878
Just as you expected,

226
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,078
Mr. Toriumi asked Pops, a famed detective,

227
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,379
to search the whereabouts of Motoko.

228
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,578
She's my fiancee but she suddenly disappeared.

229
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:07,878
Then with the help of Kumi

230
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,678
and based on my neighbor, Mitsue, testimony,

231
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:13,878
Ryuji and I will be suspected.

232
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,878
And Pops concludes that Ms. Motoko was killed by you two

233
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:20,578
and reports this to Mr. Toriumi,

234
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,478
the scenario is completed.

235
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:27,878
We don't care if Toriumi files charges against us.

236
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:30,778
Because the corpse isn't going to be found anywhere.

237
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,278
Where is Ms. Kawaguchi now?

238
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,478
We have her waiting in a hideout

239
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:39,478
for us to tell her that our scheme had succeeded.

240
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,778
I understand how you all feel,

241
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:47,379
but how am I supposed to report this to my client?

242
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:54,978
Why don't you tell him the truth?

243
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:57,578
That Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi wants to cut all ties with him

244
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:00,978
to the point where she doesn't mind faking being killed.

245
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:05,178
So to give her up like a man and break off the engagement.

246
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:07,378
To persuade him to do so?

247
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:09,978
I know you can do it, Pops.

248
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:11,278
Mr. Mouri?

249
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,879
-Mr. Mouri! -Mr. Mouri.

250
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,678
I'll bring Haruki Toriumi here,

251
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:20,278
so why don't you guys directly tell him the truth.

252
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:25,678
Then, I'll give you my word,

253
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,279
that I'll convince him to give up on Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi!

254
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,678
Oh, Ms. Shigemi. Let's call Motoko.

255
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:39,078
Yes, we'd better let her know.

256
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:41,379
I wonder if she'll answer.

257
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,478
She's still not answering.

258
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:46,878
Still not answering?

259
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,078
We secretly sent her off three nights ago.

260
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,178
Don't worry. I'm sure everything will work out okay!

261
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:56,378
I'll contact you as soon as I find a hideout.

262
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:59,478
You can't get a hold of her since?

263
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:02,078
I've tried calling her several times too.

264
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,378
I wonder if she still haven't found a place to stay.

265
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:07,678
I hope she's not sick or anything.

266
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,879
-Right. -Right.

267
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,879
Maybe.

268
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:17,879
If so there should be some trace.

269
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,178
Dropped something again.

270
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:22,878
Again?

271
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,678
Early in the morning the day before yesterday,

272
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:27,878
there was somebody looking for something there.

273
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:30,678
It seems he couldn't find what he was looking for though.

274
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:33,079
What was he like?

275
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,379
So, something was left behind after all.

276
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,879
A cufflink.

277
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:02,678
These two killed Motoko and hid her body?

278
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,578
Yes, but it was a fake murder.

279
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,278
I'm turning them into the police!

280
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:09,878
That's why I just told you that it was fake murder.

281
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:12,378
Bring Motoko here then!

282
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:14,778
Well, the thing is we can't get a hold of her.

283
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:16,978
See! I'm calling the police after all!

284
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:19,879
Well, Mr. Toriumi, like I was saying...

285
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,379
Mr. Mouri?

286
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:33,478
Sleeping Kogoro?

287
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:37,478
Okay, let's try calling Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi.

288
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:39,679
-Conan! -Yes!

289
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,178
Hello, Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi?

290
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:46,278
I'm...

291
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,279
It can't be.

292
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,679
It's a farce!

293
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:52,978
You're right, it's a farce.

294
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:56,278
Used to verify your reaction!

295
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,378
As a result,

296
00:17:57,379 --> 00:18:01,578
you knew that Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi couldn't answer the phone.

297
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:03,778
So what?

298
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:06,578
You knew, didn't you?

299
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:09,678
About this schemed fake murder.

300
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,678
Since you suspected that Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi was scheming something,

301
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,379
three days ago you secretly followed her.

302
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:23,478
And you pressed her for what she had up her sleeve,

303
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:26,578
Ms. Motoko told you everything.

304
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:31,178
Because she wanted you to understand how cornered she was.

305
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:32,878
Fake murder?

306
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:36,378
After we sent her off, you met Motoko...

307
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:39,678
I didn't see her, nor did I follow her in the first place.

308
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,278
Conan! Bring that stuff.

309
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,478
Okay.

310
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:43,679
This, right?

311
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:47,878
I checked with your secretary

312
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:51,978
and found that this cufflink was given to you.

313
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:55,078
A specially ordered item made just for you.

314
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,978
You were looking for it on the road inside the Beika residence

315
00:18:57,979 --> 00:19:02,278
early morning two days ago.

316
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,178
Did you drop something?

317
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:07,778
Which means you lost it the day before.

318
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,978
At night, three days ago!

319
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:14,378
In other words, you were there that night!

320
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:18,678
Your fingerprints and Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi were found on the cufflink.

321
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,978
That is, you had contact with each other!

322
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:27,179
It probably flew off when you tried to force Ms. Motoko into your car.

323
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:33,178
Then, after hearing about the scheme from Ms. Motoko,

324
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:36,078
you decided to use it to your advantage

325
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,378
and you murdered her!

326
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:41,578
Why would I do that?

327
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:44,278
I'm sure you didn't really want to marry

328
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:46,578
a woman who didn't like you, either.

329
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:48,278
But you were so worried about public standing

330
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:50,378
that didn't want to break off the engagement.

331
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:52,478
However, if your fiancee were killed,

332
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:54,378
you wouldn't have to get married.

333
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:57,578
Then, all I have to do is do as everyone schemed, right?

334
00:19:57,579 --> 00:20:00,978
No, in your case it was not fake,

335
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:05,978
but you really wanted her gone from the face of this earth.

336
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:09,678
Because you never know when, how and who will realize that your fiancee

337
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,578
who was supposed to have been killed is alive.

338
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,278
You killed her with your own hands, buried and hid her,

339
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,878
then came to me to ask me to look for her.

340
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:22,578
You were waiting for me to report to you

341
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:24,678
after I found out from Ms. Terakado and the others about their scheme.

342
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:30,078
You were planning to place an anonymous call to the police.

343
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,478
And tell them that you witnessed something like a corpse being buried

344
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,978
to help them locate the corpse.

345
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:39,178
And if they found the corpse like you planned,

346
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,878
it would be concluded as a crime committed by Ms. Terakado and the others.

347
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:42,978
Wrong!

348
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:46,479
I met Motoko, but I left and came home right away.

349
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:51,978
Oh, I'll get it!

350
00:20:51,979 --> 00:20:55,278
Yes...

351
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,779
If I say so, they'll know what it's about?

352
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:02,179
He got off at the Kofu junction.

353
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,278
I had them check on what you were doing that night!

354
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:10,078
I guess you got off at the Kofu Junction

355
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,478
and went on to a mountain road or something?

356
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,478
In order to get rid of the corpse you had in your car.

357
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:18,279
Where is she? Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi?

358
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,079
Where is she?

359
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:25,879
You're not getting away!

360
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,878
Where's Motoko?

361
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:32,479
Because...

362
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:35,479
Because...

363
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:41,079
If only you didn't get engaged with me...

364
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:58,379
I'll let you rest in peace like you should.

"Toriumi Conglomerate Heir Arrested" -Public standing my foot!

366
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:30,379
What a petty man!

367
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,679
I forgot to get paid!

368
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,979
You're just as petty as he is.

369

"Next Episode" -Risa Purple sure is popular, isn't she?

370
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:59,978
Did you see the guys who came down from the boat boarding area over there?

371
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:03,378
I saw them get on a red truck and go that way.

372
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:04,878
A red truck?

373
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:06,478
Got it!
