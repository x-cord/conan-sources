1
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:58,984
The other day, I found a cute one here.

2
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,308
A pet shop?

3
00:02:01,309 --> 00:02:02,808
A cute one?

4
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:06,008
I wanted to show it to you guys.

5
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:08,608
It looks to be their day off.

6
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:10,208
True.

7
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:11,608
So, here it is.

8
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:12,709
Huh?

9
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:16,808
I told them I'd be coming at 10 am, and yet...

10
00:02:16,809 --> 00:02:20,008
Hey, it seems like they're opening the shutter.

11
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:21,308
What?

12
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:22,809
Yeah.

13
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:29,209
Excuse me! My name is Ninomiya.

14
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:39,209
Is anybody in?

15
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:44,408
There he is! He's the one! This one!

16
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:48,008
-What? -Genta, you mean this?

17
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:49,509
Yeah.

18
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:52,409
How ugly!

19
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:56,008
What's this sound?

20
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,308
Maybe something got away, like a snake or something.

21
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:59,608
What?

22
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:01,409
-Snake! -Snake!

23
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,309
It's a beetle!

24
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:08,708
I got it.

25
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:11,608
Why is a beetle in a place like this?

26
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,409
Furthermore, at this time of season.

27
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:31,509
What?

28
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,608
What's up, Conan?

29
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:35,308
-What is it? -Talk about messy.

30
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:36,809
Stay away!

31
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:45,009
"Mysterious Spring Beetle."

32
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:50,108
The victim is the owner of the pet shop, Mr. Minoru Shirai, age 41.

33
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,308
There are traces of strangulation.

34
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:54,608
The murder weapon hasn't been found yet.

35
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,609
Yes, sir. Okay.

36
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:00,008
There were traces of him having been strangled

37
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:02,808
with a thin thread-like thing.

38
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,608
He seems to have been killed elsewhere

39
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:08,208
then brought here.

40
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:09,908
How can you tell?

41
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:12,508
If he died here, his legs should be stretched straight

42
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:15,108
due to postmortem stiffening.

43
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:16,208
I see.

44
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,908
Mr. Ninomiya.

45
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:21,708
You were scheduled to come here at 10 am?

46
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,408
Yes. I was told to call the shop at 6 pm last night

47
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:29,808
to check if it came in or not, so I called.

48
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:32,408
Did you notice anything strange back then?

49
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:36,408
Nothing in particular, except for that frog croaking.

50
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,109
Croaking?

51
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:42,308
Hey, what were you planning on buying?

52
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:45,608
What? Oh, a beetle.

53
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:47,208
A beetle?

54
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:49,308
You mean they sell it in this season?

55
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:52,108
Yes. I was told something about a place in Gunma

56
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:56,608
where you can get beetles all year round.

57
00:04:56,609 --> 00:04:57,908
Gunma?

58
00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:00,508
Please tell me where were you yesterday?

59
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,208
I was sleeping till noon and from 3 pm to 10 pm,

60
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,909
I was working at a family restaurant.

61
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:08,208
Beetle?

62
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:10,009
What's that?

63
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:13,508
This is it!

64
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,308
Yes! Mr. Shirai probably went here.

65
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:19,408
Gunma...

66
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:23,908
Officer Sato, we found this in the victim's pocket.

67
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:26,208
-There was nothing more inside? -No, madam.

68
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,209
Where's the lid?

69
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,408
The thing is, we can't find it.

70
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:32,108
But why would something like this be here?

71
00:05:32,109 --> 00:05:36,208
Hey, stay still!

72
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,908
Hey! What's that?

73
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:40,308
Isn't that a beetle?

74
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:43,208
I found it walking there a while ago.

75
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,308
Big, isn't it?

76
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:46,408
How dare you all just come in like that?

77
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:47,809
Go on home!

78
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,809
We're sorry!

79
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:54,208
Gosh. If she chases us out,

80
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:57,208
we won't be able to investigate, you know.

81
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:59,308
Sorry, sorry, but...

82
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:02,108
See? Here's the flyer that Conan was looking at a while ago.

83
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:03,608
I guess we can go to...

84
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:06,508
The insect pavilion in Gunma for now.

85
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:08,608
Let's go!

86
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:12,108
But, how do we get there?

87
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:13,708
That's true.

88
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,509
You guys...

89
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:20,808
Hi there, kids!

90
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:22,808
-Officer... -Takagi.

91
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:24,509
Huh?

92
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:32,408
What's with all of you?

93
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:33,908
Hurry, Officer Takagi!

94
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,408
Hurry, to where?

95
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,008
We've found a clue!

96
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:39,008
-What? -Hurry, hurry!

97
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:41,008
Where do you want me to go?

98
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,008
Straight! Straight ahead!

99
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:45,008
What?

100
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,708
Straight...

101
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:49,108
Hey, it's dangerous! Keep your eye on the road!

102
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,708
Yeah. But straight ahead is...

103
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:53,309
the expressway.

104
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,008
Hey, hey. Where are we headed for?

105
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:00,609
Isn't it about time you guys tell me?

106
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:04,608
You'll be surprised out of your wits.

107
00:07:04,609 --> 00:07:07,208
To the Gunma Insect Museum!

108
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:10,208
Let's see what's on today.

109
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:12,308
Gunma Insect museum...

110
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:15,008
I see, a museum.

111
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:17,808
What? Gunma!

112
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:20,108
Gosh! You gotta be kidding!

113
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:21,908
We're heading back! We're going home!

114
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,209
But...

115
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:28,508
So, there was such an incident.

116
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:31,008
Then, the more so, we've got to head back and investigate.

117
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:34,208
But we've already come a long way.

118
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:36,208
Isn't it almost Gunma?

119
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:38,908
Well, no problem is there? It's your day off, right?

120
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,008
But...

121
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:43,508
Isn't it a bit cold?

122
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:46,208
I'm sorry. This car doesn't have a heater.

123
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:49,608
What? I didn't know such a car existed in this day and age.

124
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:52,109
-Junk. -Well, I'm so sorry!

125
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:58,908
Huh? Don't tell me that, you're who I think you are,

126
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:01,208
but don't tell me it's you, Conan?

127
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:04,108
Officer klutz of the Gunma Prefectural Police Department.

128
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,208
He's...

129
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,608
The officer that goofed and let a murderer get away some time ago.

130
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,709
You know what...

131
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:15,208
Mr. Mouri is not with you today?

132
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:16,109
Nope.

133
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,008
That's too bad. If Mr. Mouri were here,

134
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:23,009
we could've maybe seen the Sleeping Kogoro deduction show.

135
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:26,208
Well, but I guess a mere beetle theft

136
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:31,009
doesn't warrant an appearance from the renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri.

137
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:34,109
Beetle theft?

138
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,408
Is this the truck that was stolen?

139
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,609
Yes, sir. No mistake.

140
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:48,008
The beetle...

141
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:50,508
Isn't there a beetle there?

142
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:52,808
The thief probably took it away

143
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:56,209
with another car that he had prepared here.

144
00:08:58,109 --> 00:09:02,108
Gosh, that's too much! Who would do this?

145
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,308
When was it stolen?

146
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:06,608
About 7 pm last night.

147
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:09,308
This is Mr. Araki of this museum here,

148
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:11,708
and he is beetle researcher, Mr. Haruna.

149
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:13,908
After loading the beetles onto the truck,

150
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:16,908
they went into the museum for a brief moment, and it was during this time,

151
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:20,408
somebody stole their truck from them.

152
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:22,808
I didn't think that yesterday after I went home,

153
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:26,408
the precious beetles would be stolen.

154
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:30,108
He is the editor of an insect magazine, Mr. Ishida.

155
00:09:30,109 --> 00:09:31,309
"Takashi Ishida (25)"

156
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:37,708
I'm sure glad that at least the truck came back.

157
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:39,908
Mr. Haruna, let's deliver the beetles

158
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:42,108
we promised to the children once again.

159
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:43,608
Yeah, let's do that.

160
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:48,408
Why do you have beetles at this museum even if it's not summer?

161
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:50,508
Mr. Haruna succeeded in finding a way

162
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:53,508
to make them emerge into adults all year round.

163
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,708
The larva that has been preserved

164
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:59,408
at 10 degrees C to 15 degrees C is put into another container

165
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:01,908
and the temperature is raised to 28 degrees C.

166
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:05,308
Then the larva starts to grow.

167
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:08,008
Adjusting the temperature is crucial.

168
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:11,308
But, isn't it cold when you transport them by truck?

169
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:13,408
That's nothing to worry about.

170
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:15,808
This truck is equipped with an air conditioner

171
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:18,908
in order to enable temperature adjustment.

172
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,808
When we transport adult beetles,

173
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:23,508
we keep the temperature at 28 degrees C.

174
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:27,308
The beetles are "richer" than you, Officer Takagi.

175
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:29,008
Yeah, yeah.

176
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:31,908
Conan, could it be that the beetle

177
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:33,508
that we saw back at Mr. Shirai's place was also...

178
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:35,808
Huh? Mr. Shirai?

179
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:39,108
Mr. Shirai of the pet shop. Do you know him?

180
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:41,508
Yes. He came to ask us to sell him a beetle.

181
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,208
He was extremely persistent.

182
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,308
All that man is ever concerned about is money.

183
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:51,208
I didn't continue my research on beetles all this time for money.

184
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,908
Did Mr. Shirai do something?

185
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:56,408
Don't tell me he's the one who stole it?

186
00:10:56,409 --> 00:11:02,208
No. Well, this morning, he was found killed at his shop in Tokyo.

187
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:04,708
-Huh? -Killed?

188
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:07,908
But if he was killed in Tokyo,

189
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:10,008
why did you all come out to a place like this?

190
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:12,208
Oh, well...

191
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:14,208
Where were all of you last night?

192
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:17,108
You mean we're under suspicion?

193
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,608
No! This is just to be on the safe side.

194
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:23,708
I contacted the police and had them come right away

195
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:26,908
so I couldn't have murdered Mr. Shirai.

196
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:30,908
I was looking all night for the truck,

197
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:32,708
but ended up finding nothing after all.

198
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:35,708
-All by yourself? -Yes, sir.

199
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,308
I was doing some interviews until 6 pm yesterday,

200
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:41,708
and then returned to Tokyo.

201
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:44,308
I had appointments for a continuation for an interview today too,

202
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:47,108
but I'm not involved

203
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:50,809
because I don't even know this Mr. Shirai at all.

204
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:54,008
Did you find something?

205
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:56,008
Soil?

206
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:58,308
Yeah, that's hum.

207
00:11:58,309 --> 00:11:59,608
Hum?

208
00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:02,109
It's used to raise larva.

209
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:04,908
That's...

210
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:08,108
It looks like the lid of something.

211
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:10,708
No, no! Don't touch it!

212
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,708
What happened?

213
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:14,408
I wonder if this was here before?

214
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,709
I don't think so.

215
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,509
Mr. Shirai was transported on this truck.

216
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:36,008
Officer Takagi?

217
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:37,309
Yes!

218
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:42,409
Officer Sato?

219
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,208
What brings you here?

220
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:47,709
Well...

221
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,908
All of you!

222
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:55,009
We beat you to it.

223
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,908
I want to keep a beetle, too!

224
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:08,408
If you want one, I'll give you one.

225
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:10,608
What? Really?

226
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:14,708
But you've got to raise it so that it lives as long as it can.

227
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:18,508
Why do you think we're researching beetles?

228
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:21,208
That's because through getting to know beetles,

229
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:24,509
we want to relay to everyone the importance of life.

230
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:27,908
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:32,508
Your cell phone doesn't have a strap, does it?

232
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:36,508
Huh? What happened to your museum strap?

233
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:39,408
You had it hanging around your neck yesterday.

234
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:42,008
I gave it to a child of my acquaintance.

235
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:44,808
You mean there's a strap of the insect museum?

236
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:47,608
Yeah. Would you all like one, too?

237
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:50,209
Yes, we'd like one, for sure!

238
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:55,708
Well, well, what a surprise!

239
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,508
To think that a mere insect theft

240
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:00,908
may be connected to a murder case.

241
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:04,608
Just a minute! He is not a "mere" insect theft!

242
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:06,208
I'm sorry. My tongue sort of slipped.

243
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:10,208
Officer Sato. When was Mr. Shirai murdered?

244
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:14,908
The estimated time of death was between 9 pm to 10 pm.

245
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:17,508
-Right, Officer Sato? -Yes.

246
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:19,609
I just found out a while ago.

247
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:23,008
Between 9 pm to 10 pm...

248
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:24,908
And this morning at about 5 am,

249
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:27,208
the sound of the shutter of the pet shop being opened

250
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:28,508
seems to have been heard.

251
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:31,408
5 am? Strange.

252
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:34,308
If he was murdered between 9 pm to 10 pm,

253
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:36,008
why would such a sound be heard at that hour?

254
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,208
Could it be Mr. Shirai's ghost?

255
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,408
Considering his time of death,

256
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:45,409
his body temperature was greatly decreased.

257
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:50,308
I see. So, that's the story.

258
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:53,008
That's why the killer waited until daybreak

259
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:55,708
to transport the corpse that he had on him.

260
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:59,309
Which means that the killer is among the three.

261
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:08,020
Straps!

262
00:15:08,021 --> 00:15:10,820
-Look, look. -See? Great, isn't it?

263
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:12,820
I got one, too!

264
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:14,020
Hey, hey.

265
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:16,221
Here! This is yours, Conan.

266
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:20,420
Thank you.

267
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:23,021
-We all have one. -Yeah.

268
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:26,820
According to my deduction,

269
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:30,220
I think that the one who killed Mr. Shirai is Mr. Haruna.

270
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,620
What?

271
00:15:31,621 --> 00:15:34,120
Mr. Haruna. After the truck was stolen,

272
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:37,820
you said you were driving around looking for it, didn't you?

273
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,620
But...

274
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:42,720
Back then! You found Mr. Shirai.

275
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:45,121
You took revenge on him for stealing your beetles and...

276
00:15:48,721 --> 00:15:52,320
Wrong! It's not Mr. Haruna!

277
00:15:52,321 --> 00:15:53,820
Right, right!

278
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:59,120
Mr. Haruna is researching beetles to relay the importance of life,

279
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:01,020
so he would never do something like that!

280
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:02,621
Right!

281
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:05,921
Well...

282
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:19,320
You do know what's going on, don't you?

283
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:21,921
Just as would be expected of members of the Youth Detective Squad.

284
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:25,520
If so, who is the real killer?

285
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:27,520
What is going on with him?

286
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:29,720
We'll leave that aside for a while

287
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:33,020
and think about the theft first.

288
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:35,220
The one who stole the truck with the beetles in it

289
00:16:35,221 --> 00:16:38,120
was Mr. Shirai, who was killed.

290
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:40,020
But according to what Mr. Ninomiya,

291
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:41,820
the one who was the first to find Mr. Shirai says,

292
00:16:41,821 --> 00:16:44,720
Mr. Shirai was at his shop at 6 pm.

293
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:47,020
The truck was stolen at 7 pm.

294
00:16:47,021 --> 00:16:50,220
Wouldn't it have been impossible for Mr. Shirai to steal it?

295
00:16:50,221 --> 00:16:55,820
No. Mr. Shirai used Mr. Ninomiya to make up his alibi.

296
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:58,320
He told Mr. Ninomiya to call him at 6 pm,

297
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:00,920
then had the call transferred to his cell phone.

298
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:03,420
He then made Mr. Ninomiya hear

299
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:05,920
the croaking of the frog that he had in the bottle,

300
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:07,420
saying that it's the croaking of the frog

301
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:10,120
that he is selling at his shop or something to that effect.

302
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:12,721
Then, I'll see you tomorrow at 10 am.

303
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:16,020
That's why Mr. Ninomiya thought that.

304
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:20,020
Mr. Shirai was at the shop yesterday.

305
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:23,620
Besides, he did see the frog in the shop this morning, too.

306
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:28,820
However, the one who stole the beetles was not Mr. Shirai alone.

307
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:30,120
What?

308
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:36,020
On the way transporting the beetles, Mr. Shirai and the other thief

309
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,621
for some reason got into an argument.

310
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:46,420
At that time, the killer whose cell phone strap was cut

311
00:17:46,421 --> 00:17:49,920
strangled Mr. Shirai with that strap

312
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:52,720
and killed him.

313
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:54,920
I'm sure that the fingerprints of Mr. Shirai

314
00:17:54,921 --> 00:17:57,820
are on the killer's cell phone.

315
00:17:57,821 --> 00:18:01,120
If he didn't wipe them off himself, that is.

316
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,320
The killer after killing Mr. Shirai figured

317
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:06,720
that he would make it look as if the shop had been robbed,

318
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:11,120
and took the body to the shop at 5:00 in the morning,

319
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:13,520
because he heard Mr. Shirai tell Mr. Ninomiya

320
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:16,420
that he would be at the shop.

321
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:18,520
The killer decided to use Mr. Shirai's alibi trick

322
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:21,920
to his own advantage.

323
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:25,420
But why did he move the body at daybreak?

324
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:28,420
Where was the body for 7 to 8 hours before that?

325
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:31,820
In the truck that we just saw!

326
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:35,520
There was a lot of hum spilled all over the bed of the truck,

327
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:38,420
and a lot of that hum was attached to Mr. Shirai's hair.

328
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:41,020
Besides, the lid of the bottle that was in the victim's pocket

329
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:44,520
was found on the bed of the truck.

330
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:49,420
The bed of the truck is made so that the temperature can be adjusted.

331
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:52,920
After unloading the beetles, the killer turned on the cooler

332
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:56,420
and set the temperature to winter temperature.

333
00:18:56,421 --> 00:18:58,120
Under normal conditions, the temperature of dead bodies decreases

334
00:18:58,121 --> 00:19:01,420
at a rate of about one degree C an hour.

335
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:04,220
But if the body is left in winter temperature,

336
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:06,720
the temperature will go down faster than usual.

337
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:08,920
By doing so, the killer was able to make it look as if

338
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:12,220
the estimated time of death was as early as 6 pm.

339
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:17,020
That's why something about the temperature of the corpse was unnatural.

340
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:19,820
Yes, then he messed the room up

341
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:21,220
to make it look as if a robbery took place.

342
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:25,620
If it looks as if Mr. Shirai was killed at his shop in Tokyo

343
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:29,720
and the killer gets back to Gunma by 6 pm,

344
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:33,720
he figured he would've created an alibi for himself.

345
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:38,020
But the estimated time of death between 9 pm to 10 pm

346
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:41,320
was figured out on a basis other than the body temperature.

347
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:43,520
How dare you make light of the police?

348
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:47,420
And the killer who had promised to come here today

349
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:50,320
drove the truck and abandoned it in the mountains

350
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:52,521
where it was found a while ago.

351
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:55,621
Which means...

352
00:19:57,721 --> 00:20:02,421
Mr. Ishida, you knew Mr. Shirai, didn't you?

353
00:20:03,221 --> 00:20:04,920
No...

354
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:08,020
When Mr. Ninomiya came to Mr. Shirai's shop,

355
00:20:08,021 --> 00:20:10,620
he seems to have used the map that was in the magazine

356
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:13,420
that you work as editor for to find his way.

357
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,320
Oh, another person...

358
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:18,520
Someone else was in charge of it.

359
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:21,120
The mail that you got just a while ago...

360
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:23,720
Wasn't it from one of your clients, Mr. Ishida?

361
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:26,120
"Sold out of males."

362
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:29,320
I heard that this is what you wrote in your reply.

363
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:30,920
I was able to read the kanji characters.

364
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:33,220
It was written "Sold out".

365
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:37,020
You conspired with Mr. Shirai and stole the beetles!

366
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:41,020
Furthermore, you killed him!

367
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:42,920
The cell phone strap.

368
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:48,320
The same one as this was also on your cell phone yesterday, wasn't it?

369
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:50,420
I'm pretty sure that it will match

370
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:53,320
with the traces left on Mr. Shirai's neck.

371
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:56,120
This strap!

372
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,720
Mr. Shirai seems to have pulled extremely hard.

373
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:01,320
Because the same traces of the strap

374
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:03,720
that was found on the late Mr. Shirai's neck

375
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:07,321
is also in view on the back of your neck, too.

376
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:11,221
Mr. Ishida.

377
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:15,620
That jerk!

378
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:19,621
Well, I guess you get 10% of the total this time.

379
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:23,120
Because you virtually did nothing.

380
00:21:23,121 --> 00:21:24,420
What?

381
00:21:24,421 --> 00:21:27,620
All you ever do is follow me from behind.

382
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:30,720
You're lucky that I even give you a share each time.

383
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:33,120
You gotta be grateful, man.

384
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:35,120
What'd you say?

385
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:39,121
All he ever did was look down on me!

386
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:12,620
Comfortable! Really comfortable!

387
00:23:12,621 --> 00:23:14,920
This is the way cars should be!

388
00:23:14,921 --> 00:23:16,920
Officer Sato.

389
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:18,820
If you're planning to date Officer Takagi,

390
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:21,320
I'd advise you not to go driving.

391
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:24,220
Huh?

392
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:25,321
Why do you say that?

393
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:32,221
Shoots. Nobody's riding with me.

394
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:35,820
Huh?

395
00:23:35,821 --> 00:23:37,420
Why are you in here?

396
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:40,920
Where on earth am I headed?

397
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,920
I'm going back to Tokyo!

398
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,120
What?

399
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:46,320
-Hey, stop! Please let me off! -No, I can't!

400
00:23:46,321 --> 00:23:49,320
-Let me off! -We're on the freeway!

401
00:23:49,321 --> 00:23:52,620
Huh? I wonder what's going on with Officer Takagi?

402
00:23:52,621 --> 00:23:54,220
How dangerous!

403
00:23:54,221 --> 00:23:56,120
I wonder what Officer Takagi's doing anyway.

404
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:58,520
Maybe he just wants attention.

405
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,621
Drive safely, man.

406
00:24:02,021 --> 00:24:05,821
"Next Episode" -2 years ago is before I enrolled.

407
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:16,721
My grudge has not yet vanished.

408
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:20,720
The soil is muddy with rain.

409
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:23,821
The thing that's supposed to be here is not here.

410
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:31,921
Next Conan, "Teitan High School Ghost Story (Part 1)"

411
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:50,220
Next Conan's Hint:

412
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:51,920
"Desk."

413
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:52,921
The next episode is a ghost story.

414
00:24:52,922 --> 00:24:54,420
-The science room. -The mirror in the corridor.

415
00:24:54,421 --> 00:24:56,121
Hanako!
