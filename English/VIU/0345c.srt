1
00:00:06,603 --> 00:00:09,102
You're...

2
00:00:09,103 --> 00:00:13,563
The detective kid.

3
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:17,903
Shinichi Kudo?

4
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:24,325
What? No way!

5
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:26,525
What brings you here?

6
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,925
-Shinichi Kudo? -Shinichi Kudo?

7
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:33,225
Kudo? You mean that famous high school detective?

8
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:35,025
What?

9
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:37,526
So, he wasn't dead.

10
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:49,825
It can't be...

11
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:51,925
No way.

12
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:55,525
I got rid of that kid some time ago.

13
00:00:55,526 --> 00:00:58,325
See. You have nothing to complain about now, do you?

14
00:00:58,326 --> 00:00:59,726
Hurry and give me the film.

15
00:01:11,726 --> 00:01:13,726
Gin.

16
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:20,026
Gin killed him with a poison drug.

17
00:01:22,126 --> 00:01:25,226
What is going on?

18
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,026
Hey.

19
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:11,025
Will you grant me

20
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:12,426
just one favor?

21
00:02:28,726 --> 00:02:31,725
Detective kid, long time no see!

22
00:02:31,726 --> 00:02:34,425
Sorry for saying this after you've made your grand appearance

23
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:37,225
but this case has already been solved!

24
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:40,525
The one who shot Mr. Fukuura

25
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,725
from the top of the mast that you're standing right now

26
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:44,825
when he was just about to give out the hint to the quiz,

27
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:48,925
is the one who sneaked out of the cabin, the party hall,

28
00:02:48,926 --> 00:02:51,425
and came out to this dark deck

29
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:54,425
as well as the one who was able to place the card of the devil

30
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:56,926
on the arrow of the bow gun that was fired...

31
00:02:58,026 --> 00:02:59,925
can be none other than

32
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:02,325
the one who has no alibi at that time

33
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:04,125
on top of not having the card of the devil on him,

34
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:07,226
Mummy, who's right here with me!

35
00:03:09,226 --> 00:03:12,725
Where in my deduction am I off track?

36
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,225
Hey! Come on, say something!

37
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:17,425
Oh, excuse me.

38
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:21,025
I got a bit of a cold and my throat's...

39
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:23,725
A cold?

40
00:03:23,726 --> 00:03:25,125
So...

41
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:27,525
You mentioned his alibi and his card, is that right?

42
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:28,925
The killer probably

43
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:31,525
pick-pocketed Mummy's card

44
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:33,625
in order to frame him as the killer.

45
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:36,225
The killer pick-pocketed?

46
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:39,525
If you insist that Mummy's not the killer

47
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:42,325
the only probable deduction is either he dropped it,

48
00:03:42,326 --> 00:03:44,525
or somebody stole it from him!

49
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:46,525
After all, the card is specially made

50
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,925
so that there's only one card for each person!

51
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:50,125
Yes.

52
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:52,825
Whether the killer knew was aware of this or not,

53
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:55,025
he stole it from Mummy,

54
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,625
inside the toilet!

55
00:03:56,626 --> 00:03:58,625
In the toilet?

56
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:00,825
Hey, is that right, Mummy?

57
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:02,525
Beats me.

58
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:05,225
He, himself says he doesn't know,

59
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:07,125
so that's out!

60
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:10,225
Well, it's not surprising that he doesn't remember.

61
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:11,825
The killer probably

62
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:15,725
went into the toilet compartment next to the one Mummy went inside

63
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:18,525
and injected an anesthetic or something with a syringe

64
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:20,126
from the space of the partition of the toilet.

65
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:23,425
After Mummy sucked the vapor in and passed out,

66
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:26,125
the killer probably snuck in from the top part of the partition

67
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:28,925
and pulled the card out,

68
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:31,326
taking it from Mummy.

69
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:36,525
Hey!

70
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,125
Where do you have such evidence!

71
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:41,725
I have no such evidence.

72
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:43,425
I just mentioned

73
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:46,425
the easiest way possible to carry out the murder.

74
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:49,325
Besides, I believe that the anesthetic and syringe

75
00:04:49,326 --> 00:04:51,525
are already inside the sea.

76
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:53,325
Just what do you think you're talking about?

77
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:58,225
Don't tell me you're going to say you don't know who the killer is!

78
00:04:58,226 --> 00:05:00,725
Right?

79
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:04,325
There is indeed only one person

80
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:06,625
who could be the killer though.

81
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:08,225
Detective Mouri.

82
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:10,625
What?

83
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:12,825
The one who killed Mr. Fukuura

84
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:17,425
as well as tried to put the blame on Mummy

85
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:19,125
is none other than

86
00:05:19,126 --> 00:05:20,725
you!

87
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:23,025
Werewolf!

88
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:25,025
What?

89
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:27,326
Werewolf?

90
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:31,825
Your head must've dulled from your cold.

91
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:35,325
We all saw Werewolf come out of the toilet,

92
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:39,725
as well as just before Mr. Fukuura gave out the quiz!

93
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:41,725
While on the contrary,

94
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:45,325
Mummy wasn't seen by anybody!

95
00:05:45,326 --> 00:05:46,925
Just what are you talking about?

96
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:48,525
When I came out of the toilet,

97
00:05:48,526 --> 00:05:51,625
you were watching me!

98
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:53,025
What?

99
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:55,825
Are you doubting my memory?

100
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:56,925
I was here too,

101
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:58,525
when the quiz was just about to be announced,

102
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,325
right near you!

103
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,525
Hey,

104
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:03,125
don't tell me that you're going to say that

105
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:07,525
you weren't the Mummy but the Invisible Man?

106
00:06:07,526 --> 00:06:12,525
Frankenstein has the key that will unravel the mystery.

107
00:06:12,526 --> 00:06:15,025
Why?

108
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:17,225
Won't you tell us why,

109
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:18,725
you were acting your role as a monster

110
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:21,425
even inside the toilet?

111
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:24,726
As well as what you were surprised at right afterwards.

112
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:31,825
It's a well-known thing among we horror fans that

113
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:34,325
if there is anyone within the party grounds that is sending e-mails,

114
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:37,525
that person is a movie staff that is judging to see

115
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:39,925
whether they should give us a chance to appear in the movie or not.

116
00:06:39,926 --> 00:06:44,025
That's why I knew right off the bat that he was a staff member.

117
00:06:44,026 --> 00:06:47,525
So, I followed him to sell myself,

118
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:51,625
and kept acting my role until he came out.

119
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:54,926
But the one who came out of the toilet that he went in was...

120
00:06:57,526 --> 00:07:00,425
Werewolf?

121
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:03,325
What? You mean Mummy was Werewolf?

122
00:07:03,326 --> 00:07:04,326
Hey...

123
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:06,625
Then, don't tell me that...

124
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,725
That's right.

125
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:11,925
The killer not only wanted to put the blame on Mummy

126
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:13,725
who was asleep in the toilet,

127
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:17,025
he also put something else on Mummy

128
00:07:17,026 --> 00:07:20,725
which is his own werewolf's mask!

129
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:23,825
He probably cracked the mirror in the toilet

130
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:28,425
to keep Mummy from finding out what happened.

131
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:30,225
He doesn't have to look into the mirror

132
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:32,325
to realize that he's not wearing his original mask, does he?

133
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,525
I mean he's wearing something like this!

134
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:38,725
Since Mummy was originally wrapped up in bandage,

135
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:41,025
and moreover, if he was put to sleep.

136
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:43,325
It's no wonder that he didn't realize what had happened.

137
00:07:43,326 --> 00:07:46,525
On top of that, the mask covers and hides everything from neck down,

138
00:07:46,526 --> 00:07:49,625
so even if the color of the necktie changes, it's hard to tell.

139
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:52,225
Besides, both of them were wearing white gloves

140
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:55,225
and their outfits are more or less similar.

141
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:58,825
So I don't think anyone would've suspected anything.

142
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:01,325
But their physiques are similar

143
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:03,925
and they hold the same card of the devil,

144
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:05,525
both of them are reticent,

145
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:09,025
and they end up in the compartment next to each other.

146
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:11,825
Doesn't everything fall too much in place?

147
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:15,025
The only coincidence here is probably the pattern of the card.

148
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:16,625
The killer was waiting for the right person

149
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:19,325
to come to the toilet.

150
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:22,325
There were a lot of passengers who didn't speak a word

151
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:26,525
because they wanted to sell themselves as monsters.

152
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:28,025
So, as for piercing the card with the arrow,

153
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:31,025
the killer probably thought it up right on the spot.

154
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:33,025
The person that would be suspected as the killer

155
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:35,525
would be someone that didn't have his card.

156
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:38,425
He probably made light of it,

157
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:40,325
thinking that no one would figure out who the real killer was.

158
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:42,025
But...

159
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:44,125
when Sonoko called,

160
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:47,925
Werewolf came out of the toilet!

161
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:50,225
If he was drugged to sleep,

162
00:08:50,226 --> 00:08:52,725
how come he came out at such great timing?

163
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:54,725
Before he came out of the toilet,

164
00:08:54,726 --> 00:08:56,726
you heard something, didn't you?

165
00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:00,925
Oh, I see!

166
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:03,926
The howling of the wolf!

167
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:10,525
It seemed that he was playing the howling using a tape recorder.

168
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:13,726
If he turned the switch on from the toilet compartment next door.

169
00:09:16,726 --> 00:09:20,425
Mummy would be surprised and wake up!

170
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,625
Yeah.

171
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:24,525
The speaker was probably attached

172
00:09:24,526 --> 00:09:26,425
behind the mask.

173
00:09:26,426 --> 00:09:28,725
The killer attached a wiretap with the speaker

174
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:32,325
and put the mask on Mummy so that he would react swiftly

175
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:35,625
to the voices of the people around him.

176
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:37,625
Even if someone were to talk to him,

177
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:40,325
Mummy would think that Werewolf was being talked to

178
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:45,725
because the howling is heard at close range.

179
00:09:45,726 --> 00:09:46,925
I see.

180
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:50,125
I thought it was strange because each time he heard howling,

181
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:52,725
he was looking here and there.

182
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,025
That's how Werewolf gave everyone the impression that

183
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:59,025
he was at the party hall and created his alibi,

184
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:00,325
then he went up on deck

185
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:01,925
and fired the arrow from the bow gun at Mr. Fukuura

186
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:04,425
who was on top of the mast!

187
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:07,825
Then he used the howling to guide him

188
00:10:07,826 --> 00:10:11,825
to where Mummy was among the crowd

189
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:14,125
and tore off the mask within the crowd

190
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:16,226
and put it back on himself.

191
00:10:17,626 --> 00:10:21,425
Then he went back inside the crowd of people.

192
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:24,025
I guess that is how the story goes.

193
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:25,926
Right, Werewolf?

194
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:32,526
Am I wrong in any way?

195
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:02,300
I don't know if you're a high school detective or what

196
00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:05,200
but you can sure blabber on, can't you?

197
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:09,200
I put this mask on Mummy, you say?

198
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:13,600
Do you have proof that I did it, or what?

199
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:16,100
If it's something that points in the direction that you're the killer,

200
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:18,200
yes.

201
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:20,101
I have two!

202
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:25,300
One of it is this!

203
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:26,900
The hint of the quiz

204
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:30,601
about there's a human among the monsters here.

205
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:33,500
Rooster?

206
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:36,000
Hey, where'd you get that?

207
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:38,700
It was tied to a rope here.

208
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:42,300
I think that Mr. Fukuura with the spotlight on himself

209
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,301
was going to do this!

210
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:48,100
What?

211
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:49,700
Suspend it upside down?

212
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:51,100
Upside down?

213
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:52,600
The opposite of a rooster is...

214
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:54,000
"Retsoor"?

215
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:55,600
"Sterroo"?

216
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:58,900
"Terroos"?

217
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:01,500
Just what kind of hint is that supposed to be?

218
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:03,900
"Retsoor"...

219
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:05,100
I get it.

220
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:06,301
What?

221
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:10,400
Roosters are also called cock,

222
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:11,900
and he's holding it by the tail.

223
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:14,000
It is said that long ago, all kinds of liquor

224
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:16,100
were made by stirring them with the tail of the cock.

225
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:18,300
Therefore, the drinks have been called cocktails since then.

226
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:20,500
That's the origin of the word cocktail.

227
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:21,600
What?

228
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:24,000
You mean "cocktail" is the hint?

229
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:25,800
Detective Mouri.

230
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:27,900
You also drank it too, didn't you?

231
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:30,000
That cocktail.

232
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:31,700
I'm a beer drinker!

233
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:33,501
I would never drink...

234
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:40,201
Come to think of it, I was looking for Werewolf and...

235
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:44,200
Hey, boss! What's up?

236
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:45,500
Bartender.

237
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:48,500
Can you give me the same thing he's drinking?

238
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,400
I did drink it

239
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,900
now that you mentioned it.

240
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,500
If I remember correctly it was...

241
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:56,600
A cocktail called Silver Bullet!

242
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,000
We were given instructions

243
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:00,700
by Mr. Fukuura to drink it at the bar of the party hall!

244
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:02,000
Which means

245
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:05,300
you rushed out of the toilet like that back then because...

246
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:06,600
You fell asleep in the toilet

247
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:09,600
and still didn't drink the cocktail?

248
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:11,300
Yes!

249
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:13,200
That's a coincidence,

250
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:15,200
because I drank it too.

251
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:16,600
What?

252
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:17,900
You didn't!

253
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:21,300
It was Mummy who you had put your mask over!

254
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,601
It's just as Shinichi had deduced!

255
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:30,100
Stop putting on airs, brat!

256
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,900
I'm the only Werewolf here!

257
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:35,700
And Werewolf!

258
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:38,600
Did you really drink that cocktail?

259
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:41,000
You, who wanted to sell your act as Werewolf,

260
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:43,700
and appear in the movie?

261
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:46,200
Yeah, to pep me up.

262
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,000
Or, are you saying that.

263
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:50,901
Werewolf is not supposed to drink liquor?

264
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:54,900
You really drank Silver Bullet?

265
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,200
Shut up, persistent brat!

266
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:58,100
I drank it!

267
00:13:58,101 --> 00:13:59,801
Silver Bullet?

268
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:03,400
Hey, no way.

269
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:04,900
Silver Bullet?

270
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:06,200
Silver Bullet, that's...

271
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:09,101
-Yeah. -Werewolf would never drink it.

272
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:17,400
Yes. The name of the cocktail was Silver Bullet.

273
00:14:17,401 --> 00:14:20,901
Just as the name goes, a silver bullet.

274
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:24,100
It's the only weapon in the movie

275
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:27,901
that is capable of killing the Werewolf.

276
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:35,900
It's a thing that any horror fan would know.

277
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:39,100
And a cocktail with that name

278
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:41,600
is also used to ward off evil.

279
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:45,300
Mr. Fukuura probably intended to use this cocktail as a hint

280
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,700
and lure people to the bar

281
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:49,700
then later ask the bartender

282
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:52,500
who drank what kind of liquor

283
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:57,200
and have everyone answer that Mummy who ordered Silver Bullet

284
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:59,900
was the human among the monsters.

285
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,800
Because no monster would go out of their way

286
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,700
to order liquor to ward off evil.

287
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:07,501
Isn't that right, Werewolf?

288
00:15:09,301 --> 00:15:10,400
Well...

289
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:14,100
Since the bartender heard nothing beforehand from Mr. Fukuura,

290
00:15:14,101 --> 00:15:17,901
he seems to have served Detective Mouri the same liquor, though.

291
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:22,600
If Mr. Fukuura was the one who did the makeup for Mummy,

292
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:23,900
it's most likely that

293
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:27,000
the answer is under the bandage.

294
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:28,500
The bull's eye mark

295
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:30,400
indicates that you're the answer!

296
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:31,601
Excuse me.

297
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:39,000
Here it is!

298
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:40,900
It says "human".

299
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:42,701
"Human."

300
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:54,500
And? What about the other evidence?

301
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:56,300
Even a marksman at the bow gun

302
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:59,200
could never pierce a person with an arrow poked

303
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:01,500
with a card through it.

304
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:03,300
Of course, he wouldn't be able to do it

305
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:05,300
from on top this unstable rope too.

306
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:07,400
In order to make sure he kills his target,

307
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:11,800
he needs to climb up here and fire at his target at point blank.

308
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:16,700
The traces of Werewolf having come up here back then is here.

309
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:19,300
What?

310
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:21,900
The traces of pieces of glass

311
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:23,500
that are embedded into the soles of your shoes

312
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:25,601
that you stepped on when you cracked the mirror in the toilet.

313
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:29,300
If we have the forensic officers match the pieces

314
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:31,101
I'm sure they will match completely.

315
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:34,500
Now, Werewolf,

316
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:38,101
please show us the soles of your shoes.

317
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:42,300
And please tell us

318
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,901
why you came all the way up here.

319
00:16:46,301 --> 00:16:50,500
So, please show us then, Werewolf!

320
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:53,101
Come on and lift your foot.

321
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:57,000
It's not me!

322
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:59,500
It... It's not me!

323
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:02,200
I had no intention of killing him!

324
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:04,000
That devil is to blame.

325
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:05,300
What?

326
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:08,400
It's all that devil's fault!

327
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:10,100
It's that devil's fault!

328
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:12,401
The one called Vermouth!

329
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:47,500
Ms. Jodie!

330
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:51,701
Dr. Araide, what seems to be the matter?

331
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:55,300
That's for me to say.

332
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,500
What do you intend to do with her?

333
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:58,800
No! No!

334
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:01,500
We were just taking a drive!

335
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:03,500
Unlike you,

336
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:06,300
I've got a lot of time on my hands!

337
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:07,800
Lot of time?

338
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:09,900
Dr. Araide, it's almost time

339
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:12,400
for the trial for the homicide case, isn't it?

340
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,400
You've got to testify as would be expected of a good citizen!

341
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:16,600
And tell everyone that

342
00:19:16,601 --> 00:19:18,900
the home helper, Hikaru Yasumoto,

343
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:20,800
is the one who pulled the trigger

344
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:22,400
and killed your father

345
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:25,300
which is a hidden fact.

346
00:19:25,301 --> 00:19:27,700
Ms. Hikaru pulled the trigger?

347
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,500
No use playing dumb with me!

348
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:34,200
Detective Mouri told me the facts about everything!

349
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:36,200
Just what are you talking about?

350
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:39,700
The killer of the case back then was my stepmother.

351
00:19:39,701 --> 00:19:42,700
And, besides, he died of electrocution,

352
00:19:42,701 --> 00:19:44,601
not bullet wounds!

353
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:51,600
Did you say Vermouth?

354
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:54,600
Are you saying that you killed Mr. Fukuura

355
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:57,000
because that character called Vermouth asked you to do so?

356
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:59,100
Hey!

357
00:19:59,101 --> 00:20:00,800
No.

358
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:04,400
It's true that I had a grudge against Mr. Fukuura

359
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:07,800
because he concluded the Unlucky Days series

360
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:10,200
that I loved more than anything else just like that

361
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:12,700
and started this kindergarten-style.

362
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:15,200
Phantom Ship Captain series.

363
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:20,600
So, I wrote about this on the BBS of a certain Internet site

364
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:22,400
saying that I wanted to work off my grudge.

365
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:27,200
Then, this person called Vermouth contacted me.

366
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:30,000
She said that she'd tell me how to kill him and prepare the weapons

367
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:32,200
if I'd like to carry it out.

368
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:34,800
What do you make of the life of a person,

369
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:37,900
carrying out murder on a motive like that?

370
00:20:37,901 --> 00:20:41,700
Of course, I refused at first!

371
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:43,300
But, after that...

372
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:45,700
pictures of my family and I that were taken secretly,

373
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:48,100
along with tapes of wire-taped telephone conversations,

374
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:52,600
as well as documents with my daily actions written to minute detail...

375
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:56,200
A whole cardboard box was delivered to me!

376
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:58,800
I was told that if I refused or reported it to the police,

377
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:01,700
either my family or I would die.

378
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:04,601
Everything I received implicated this!

379
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:12,601
His cause of death was electrocution and not by a gun?

380
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:19,900
What are you getting at?

381
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:22,000
Sorry.

382
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:24,600
The trigger I was referring to just now was

383
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:27,101
the electricity breaker.

384
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:32,900
The killer is the one who rigged everything to commit the murder

385
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:35,200
but the one who actually lifted the breaker

386
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:37,700
and triggered the murder

387
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:41,400
is Hikaru Yasumoto who knew nothing at all.

388
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,800
Therefore, in order not to hurt her feelings,

389
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:46,300
the killer and the police got together

390
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:49,200
and made up a fake record of investigation!

391
00:21:49,201 --> 00:21:52,601
It said that the method of killing was something else.

392
00:21:53,901 --> 00:21:57,000
Well, it's only natural that you don't know about this!

393
00:21:57,001 --> 00:22:00,600
Because this wasn't written on the investigation report

394
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:04,200
that you stole from the police.

395
00:22:04,201 --> 00:22:09,900
It was to learn the case and successfully testify in court

396
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:13,600
and keep existing as Dr. Araide.

397
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:16,200
Am I wrong?

398
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,101
Who are you?

399
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:24,300
"A secret makes a woman, a woman".

400
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,700
Do you remember?

401
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:29,800
These are the final words you left behind with me.

402
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:31,700
And the words I kept repeating

403
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:34,600
so I don't forget them.

404
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:38,100
The words of the one who killed my father.

405
00:22:38,101 --> 00:22:39,400
Isn't that right,

406
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,101
Chris Vineyard?

407
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:53,401
Rather...

408
00:22:53,402 --> 00:22:55,101
The other name that you go by...

409
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,940
Vermouth!

410
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,140
Who are you?

411
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,739
It's a secret. A secret.

412
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,339
I can't tell you.

413
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,739
A secret makes a woman, a woman.

414
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,139
Daddy's glasses.

415
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,939
I'm sorry.

416
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,339
Daddy. What's the matter?

417
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,739
Is he already asleep?

418
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,039
He promised to read me a story before going to bed and yet...

419
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,539
Then, will you stay by your father until he gets up?

420
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,740
Okay!

421
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,539
Then, you set fire to my house

422
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,939
and burned everything down to ashes.

423
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,539
All of what my father, as an FBI agent,

424
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,039
gathered behind closed doors,

425
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,440
the investigation data on all of you.

426
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,039
But, I was saved

427
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,639
because after that...

428
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,139
I remembered that there was no more orange juice

429
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,739
that father always drinks upon getting up

430
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,239
and since he was lying down from exhaustion from afternoon

431
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,239
taking care of my mother who wasn't feeling well.

432
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,839
I wanted to be of help and went out shopping.

433
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,639
Oh, so you're the little girl I saw back then!

434
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,439
I really went all out looking for you,

435
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,639
because all that was left from the remains

436
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,940
were the bones of your parents.

437
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,539
My father's colleagues protected me.

438
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,139
They applied for the witness protection program for me.

439
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,039
That stupid system of changing the name and address of a witness

440
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,439
whose life is in danger in order to protect that person

441
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,540
under a different identity.

442
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,139
It must've been really restricting, right?

443
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,839
To live away from your hometown, as a different person.

444
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,740
You went through hard times, didn't you?

445
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,339
And?

446
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:32,339
You took after your father, and came after me?

447
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:37,139
FBI agent Jodie Starling?

448
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,839
Just as expected of a witch with a thousand faces, Vermouth.

449
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,039
With your ability of disguise, you can sneak in anywhere

450
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,839
and check on things to your heart's content.

451
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,039
I'm amazed that you saw through the disguise of Dr. Araide.

452
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,539
It's obvious.

453
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,939
Despite of not having that bad of an illness,

454
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,239
you keep frequenting Araide Hospital with no makeup.

455
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,239
You were planning to kill him and become him!

456
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,639
Then you mean that...

457
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,639
the time his car passed right before me with his family

458
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,039
and crashed through the guard rail

459
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,140
eventually sinking into the sea...

460
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,239
was all set up by you?

461
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,439
Yes!

462
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,539
I made it look as if he died of an accident

463
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,539
before you got to kill him.

464
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,339
Because if the car was left at the bottom of the sea

465
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,539
and if nobody knew that he was dead,

466
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,539
it would make it easier for you to go around

467
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,639
acting as Dr. Araide.

468
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Of course,

469
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:43,639
the people in the car were my colleagues equipped with air pumps.

470
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,239
The real Dr. Araide is living in peace in a place far away.

471
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,939
Then just as we expected,

472
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,539
you established yourself in Araide Hospital

473
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,539
and began checking on something.

474
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,739
It was obvious what you waiting for

475
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:02,139
the moment we snuck into your room in that hospital.

476
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,139
A picture was poked all over with darts.

477
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,639
The picture of a girl in her 20's with reddish brown hair.

478
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,540
You were planning to find her and get rid of her!

479
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,539
Now I have a question!

480
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,739
The picture of the woman you were trying to get hold of and kill

481
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,139
and this girl that looks just like her.

482
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,739
Of course the witness protection program

483
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,240
will be applied to her but...

484
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,740
Is she really the woman in the picture?

485
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,239
There's still more!

486
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,339
The two pictures that were below her picture,

487
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,739
with the words Cool Guy and Angel that are written on the pictures.

488
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,139
That boy is unmistakably sharp,

489
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,539
but he's more a "kid" than a "guy," isn't he?

490
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:54,139
Yes. That boy called Conan.

491
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,939
Until that boy left the girl's side,

492
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,639
you didn't do anything.

493
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,339
Inside the bus that was jacked too.

494
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,039
Please don't!

495
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,639
It's just the mischief of a child, isn't it?

496
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,039
Will tell me why you went all out to protect that boy

497
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,840
to the point of almost risking your own life?

498
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,539
If she didn't come around,

499
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,639
things wouldn't have turned out like this.

500
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,139
So...

501
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,139
Nab that person called Vermouth too!

502
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,239
And?

503
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,539
So that name Vermouth, that sounds like the name of some liquor

504
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,339
is probably a fake name, right?

505
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,240
Do you know the person's identity?

506
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,039
You haven't seen that person yourself, either?

507
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,639
No.

508
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,039
Then, what about the receipts of the things

509
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,839
that you received that she used to blackmail you?

510
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,539
Well...

511
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,339
What? No way!

512
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,940
You threw them away?

513
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,339
The address is probably a phony one too.

514
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,639
I guess for now...

515
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,339
until we arrive at the harbor, we'll have to keep him tied up somewhere.

516
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,940
So now, the case is closed.

517
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,239
Come on.

518
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,140
Will you tell me?

519
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,639
Okay!

520
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,239
I'll tell you.

521
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,840
That's...

522
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,640
Don't move!

523
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,839
Gosh.

524
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,339
What a dangerous thing you have there.

525
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,439
Did you get permission from the police in Japan?

526
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,039
We'll request joint investigation

527
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,739
from the police here after we nab you!

528
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,439
Of course, I'm willing to take full responsibility for this.

529
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,839
But before that I have something I want to ask you!

530
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,240
And what may that be?

531
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,540
Why don't you...

532
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,940
Why don't you age at all?

533
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,039
You caught my attention because of what you said

534
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,039
in front of my mother's coffin.

535
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,440
A secret makes a woman, a woman.

536
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,039
I was really excited and started investigating,

537
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,039
then sure enough, there was a perfect match.

538
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,939
Remember back when you killed my father

539
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,839
making it look like he committed suicide.

540
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,139
You picked up his glasses trying to replace it

541
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,539
because of the way it lay unnaturally on the floor.

542
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,239
The fingerprints that were on the lens of the glasses

543
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,939
and yours matched perfectly!

544
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,939
But, I had my doubts.

545
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,839
You were too young to be a suspect of an incident

546
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,739
that had happened 20 years ago.

547
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,539
I didn't think it possible at first,

548
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,539
but when I matched your prints with a certain person's,

549
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,339
I got results that made a shiver go up my spine.

550
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:37,439
You're the one and the same as your mother, Sharon Vineyard!

551
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,639
And, I finally found the witness

552
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,939
that could explain the mystery

553
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,940
of what was keeping you from being arrested!

554
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,640
You guys! Come out and hold this woman!

555
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,039
When I get custody of you from the Japanese police,

556
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,839
I'll make you spit it out.

557
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,239
You'll tell me everything.

558
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,139
Well, even if you insist on saying nothing,

559
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,740
she will eventually.

560
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,740
Thank you, Calvados.

561
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,439
Don't kill her yet.

562
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,540
I've still got something I want to ask her.

563
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,339
Why?

564
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,839
You all staked out here

565
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,439
and figured you lured me out but...

566
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,039
I came here once already two hours ago,

567
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,339
disguised as you.

568
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,039
And this is what I said in your voice.

569
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,239
This is it tonight! Come back tomorrow!

570
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,039
Didn't you realize?

571
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,439
There was another reason as to why the papers of the cases

572
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,439
that Detective Mouri was involved in were stolen.

573
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,139
All of the documents were stolen

574
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:14,839
so that the papers we actually needed would not be specified,

575
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,939
however, all of the documents were sent back to the MPD in one batch

576
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,739
because I wanted you people to think that my stay in Japan

577
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,839
had something to do with Detective Mouri

578
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,939
so that you would stake out the detective agency.

579
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,939
Which as a result, it would help me figure out who the FBI agents are.

580
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,539
Just as expected, I figured out how many of you there were,

581
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,939
the place you were all staying

582
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,339
and the way you were all communicating.

583
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,139
I also knew that you were trying to trap me here.

584
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,339
Then, you knew that we snuck into your room too?

585
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,839
Yes. I was just playing dumb.

586
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,639
I thought that if you saw that picture,

587
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,839
you would find her for me.

588
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,439
But you surprised me twice already.

589
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,539
The first is that you are the girl

590
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,839
that I met 20 years ago.

591
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,039
The other is that

592
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,439
you knew what went on behind the scenes regarding Dr. Araide.

593
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,239
How did you get information on it

594
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,140
when nothing about it was spoken to anyone?

595
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,939
I didn't hear about it from anyone.

596
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,539
I was asked to do so by someone.

597
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,439
To corner you and disclose your identity,

598
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,539
and in turn for doing so, she said that she would trust me.

599
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,339
This girl over here.

600
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,639
Oh, I see.

601
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,540
She said so.

602
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,839
Anyway, let's hear the whole story

603
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,440
when we get to the police station!

604
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,939
He solved the case in such a short time!

605
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,839
Just as expected of Shinichi Kudo!

606
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,240
Fantastic!

607
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,539
It's nothing...

608
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,939
The reason I got to solve it right away

609
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,939
is because I used the same trick as the killer.

610
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,339
Just what does that mean?

611
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,539
What?

612
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,340
The same trick that Werewolf over there used!

613
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,639
So, this is it, for our re-encounter after 20 years.

614
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,239
It's time to say goodbye.

615
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,639
Come on and smile

616
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,540
because you're going to get to see your father in heaven.

617
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,740
What?

618
00:38:42,741 --> 00:38:46,639
The same trick as Werewolf used?

619
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,639
The killer put a mask over the victim, who was already disguised.

620
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,439
Which means he double disguised the victim.

621
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,039
Don't you only have bandages wrapped around you?

622
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,640
Just what do you mean by that?

623
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,540
Don't tell me that you're...

624
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,339
Yeah.

625
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,439
So this...

626
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,039
is what I mean!

627
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,839
What?

628
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,539
You're...

629
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,040
Heiji Hattori?

630
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,940
Cool kid?

631
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,339
Conan Edogawa.

632
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,040
A detective!

633
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,539
He wasn't Shinichi.

634
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,639
Heiji Hattori?

635
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,239
Disguise?

636
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,439
It's a disguise?

637
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,239
But his voice and tone were just like Shinichi.

638
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,340
Yes.

639
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,639
Of course.

640
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,739
It's my masterpiece that took me six hours to put him on this disguise.

641
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,739
As for his voice, the microphone on his collar

642
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:27,139
picks up the deduction that Heiji whispers into it,

643
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,839
then Shinichi says it through the microphone on his mask.

644
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,040
That voice output is the speaker on Heiji's necktie.

645
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,239
How do you like it?

646
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,540
A perfect collaboration by Dr. Agasa and I.

647
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,839
Okay! We're okay on this side, Kudo!

648
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,740
Do your thing on your side too, now!

649
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,239
Don't move!

650
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,640
Your body's the blind spot for the rifle.

651
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,139
Now...

652
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:12,439
get in the car after Ms. Jodie.

653
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,940
Let's take a drive to the police!

654
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,939
Ms. Jodie.

655
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,940
Quick and get in the car!

656
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,339
Ms. Jodie! Are you all right?

657
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,740
Yes.

658
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,940
Don't tell me that?

659
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,939
Shinichi Kudo?

660
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,139
Remember? The kid that you poisoned to death

661
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,539
with the drug made by the organization back then!

662
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,739
Sorry, Vodka.

663
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:08,239
I make it a policy to forget the name and face...

664
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,640
of the ones I get rid of.

665
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,739
And?

666
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,639
Are you saying that the kid rose from the dead

667
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,139
and appeared as a ghost?

668
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,039
Yeah, I mean no.

669
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,439
Something strange is happening.

670
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,539
Why are you disguised as Shinichi Kudo in the first place anyway?

671
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,339
Sorry! Pops!

672
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,639
I haven't seen Kudo for some time,

673
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,539
so I got kind of lonely.

674
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,539
I figured that if I came out looking like him

675
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,839
and made a deduction, maybe he just might pop out too.

676
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:48,039
But maybe he's dead, just as rumor has it, don't you think?

677
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,439
Darn it! Kid from Osaka,

678
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,839
this is the second time you're pulling this trick!

679
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,939
If Ran were here,

680
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,839
you'd be way gone by now!

681
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,439
Scary. Give me a break.

682
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,939
I had no choice.

683
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,839
After all, Kudo e-mailed me asking me to do this.

684
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,839
He told me that those guys are trying to pull him away from Ai

685
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,039
and do something,

686
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,039
so he wanted me to disguise myself as him and find out about it.

687
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,439
That's why I'm on board this ship!

688
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,939
But, it sure freaked me out

689
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,239
when I got to his house

690
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,139
and found his mother there.

691
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,839
She seems to have been worried about him,

692
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,240
and hiding for a while in the house watching him.

693
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,340
Mother?

694
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,439
Hey...

695
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,639
I didn't think she had a special talent to disguise people

696
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,539
but she would even freak Arsene Lupin out too!

697
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,739
Thanks to her,

698
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:51,039
I didn't have to complete my deduction all bandaged up.

699
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,639
The only one I'm worried about is

700
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,439
the little girl that is left sleeping

701
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,939
and confined in the basement of Dr. Agasa's house.

702
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,939
Kudo says she'll be fine

703
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,439
if she doesn't have the pursuit glasses

704
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,839
hidden somewhere with her.

705
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,739
But, if I were her...

706
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:13,439
knowing that he would be meeting someone dangerous disguised as me,

707
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,539
I wouldn't be able to wait for him just like that.

708
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,439
I would break the door open

709
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,440
and go after him no matter what.

710
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,039
No matter what, Kudo!

711
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,840
I'd go after you.

712
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,640
Haibara. You...

713
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,439
Haibara?

714
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,640
Darn it!

715
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,839
Don't come!

716
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,239
Stay away!

717
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,240
Go back!

718
00:47:26,241 --> 00:47:27,440
You idiot!

719
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,439
No, Kudo.

720
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,940
This is my problem!

721
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,440
This had nothing to do with you.

722
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,539
That's why...

723
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,840
Don't die!

724
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,840
I don't want you to die!

725
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,039
So you had the spare pursuit glasses

726
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,940
hidden after all.

727
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,539
Kudo.

728
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,939
Run for it, Haibara!

729
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,340
Hurry!

730
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,939
Just what are you doing?

731
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,639
Get out of here, Haibara!

732
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,039
Hurry and get out!

733
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,340
Quick!

734
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,639
Goodnight, baby.

735
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,840
And...

736
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,640
Welcome...

737
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,040
Sherry!

738
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,539
The only reason I can think of

739
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,839
for Vermouth to go after Haibara's life

740
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,739
and want me to stay away from her

741
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:26,539
is because of her identity as actress Chris Vineyard

742
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:30,239
as well as Sharon since she is both of them.

743
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,539
She was probably acting out two roles under disguise.

744
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,039
If she knows mom,

745
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,739
she would've probably seen pictures of me as a kid,

746
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,839
so she would've easily made out who I am

747
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,539
and I also understand why she wouldn't want

748
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,740
to be messed up with a scandal.

749
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,339
I'll be fine!

750
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:53,140
Don't worry because I promise to make it back alive!

751
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,140
Is that really true,

752
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,140
Sharon?

753
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,639
Stupid woman.

754
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,739
Screwing up this little boy's plan,

755
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:19,940
and coming out here on your own initiative to die.

756
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,639
I didn't come here just to die.

757
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,139
I came here to end everything.

758
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,239
Even if you were to be arrested,

759
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,139
as long as I'm alive,

760
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:36,839
you guys will never stop pursuing me.

761
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,039
But, I'd like you to give me your word.

762
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,740
That you will not lay a hand on anyone else except me.

763
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,740
Will you promise to give me your word?

764
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,639
Okay.

765
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,439
I'll save all the others

766
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,539
except for this woman FBI agent here.

767
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:58,339
But first, I'll get rid of you, Sherry.

768
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,939
If you want to hold a grudge on anyone,

769
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,039
hate your parents for starting

770
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,940
such a stupid research in the first place.

771
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,340
Cool kid.

772
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,539
No way!

773
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,740
How?

774
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,740
Stop! Calvados!

775
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:30,740
Could it be...

776
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,340
she saw everything?

777
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,240
Stop! Calvados!

778
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,840
Stop!

779
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,240
Can't you hear I'm telling you to stop?

780
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,539
So...

781
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:40,340
Get away from that brown-haired girl!

782
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,939
If you don't want to die, you'd better hurry!

783
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,239
No! Don't move!

784
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,740
Come on. Hurry! Get out of the way!

785
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:53,540
Stop it!

786
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,639
I called the police.

787
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,140
So just put up with this a while longer. Please!

788
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,440
Big sis.

789
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,039
Silver hair?

790
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,739
The story was meant to end this way.

791
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,140
Hate God for what is happening to you.

792
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,539
What are you doing?

793
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:38,039
Hurry and hang on to my arm!

794
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,039
Hurry or my arm will get slippery from the rain.

795
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,239
Why'd you save me?

796
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,140
Why on earth?

797
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,739
Who needs a reason?

798
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,439
Who cares what the motives are

799
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,239
for a person to want to kill another person?

800
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,440
Why would a person want to save another then?

801
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:00,540
There is no logical reason for that either, is there?

802
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,140
Get out of the way!

803
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,539
What are you doing?

804
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,140
Hurry and hang on to my arm!

805
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,240
Move it, Angel!

806
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,940
What?

807
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:45,039
This is a blind spot for the rifle.

808
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,939
When did you...

809
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,540
Throw your gun down.

810
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,839
Throw your gun down!

811
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,140
If not, I'll aim for your head next.

812
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,139
The sound of a pump?

813
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,439
A shotgun?

814
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,839
Okay! Calvados.

815
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,440
We'll attack them from both sides!

816
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,439
This is bad.

817
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,640
He's coming from behind.

818
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,739
Come on, Calvados.

819
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:36,639
Use that dear shotgun of yours

820
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,940
and blow up the little kitty FBI agent, will you?

821
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:45,740
So, his name is Calvados.

822
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,940
A rifle, a shotgun and three guns.

823
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,140
I thought he was a weapon vendor or something.

824
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,139
Shuichi Akai?

825
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,939
Shu!

826
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:04,339
But with two broken legs,

827
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,940
I don't think he'll be doing business for quite some time.

828
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:17,439
Well, Calvados is like a strong apple spirit.

829
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,839
So, I guess he's just right

830
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,239
for the partner of a rotten apple like you.

831
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,839
Rotten apple?

832
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,439
That's the name we call you by.

833
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:29,139
Golden Apple was the stage

834
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:32,139
in which the great actress Sharon stole the limelight.

835
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:35,439
You're just as beautiful now as you were back then but...

836
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,339
Inside, you're a wrinkled up rotten apple.

837
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,740
A really rotten apple!

838
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:59,339
Don't, Shu!

839
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,139
Don't worry.

840
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,439
I can tell from the way she moves

841
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,039
that she's wearing a bullet proof jacket

842
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,439
and layers of bullet proof pads all over her body.

843
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,940
I think she'll get two or three broken ribs at most.

844
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,839
Moreover, look.

845
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,439
Look at her face that tore apart with the shot that was fired.

846
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,740
That's the face of that woman with no make-up after all.

847
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,140
The brats are a nuisance!

848
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,840
Cool kid.

849
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,639
To think she can blow up the gasoline tank

850
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,740
by looking over the mirror in that situation.

851
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:36,139
She's pretty good.

852
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:37,439
Shu!

853
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,539
This is no time to be amazed by her!

854
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:43,339
She took a child hostage and got away, you know?

855
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:46,040
Then why didn't you take the key out of the car?

856
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,939
Well, I'm sorry.

857
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,739
We did get our share though,

858
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:54,140
because that woman's comrade is...

859
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,439
Hey...

860
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,639
Don't tell me he still had a gun on him?

861
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,540
Could it be that he killed himself?

862
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,839
Look at that.

863
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,340
The Japanese police are here.

864
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:16,139
This girl must've called them.

865
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,139
Inside the trunk,

866
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,739
it's hard to make out conversation

867
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:22,039
but bullets can be heard.

868
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,139
I'm sure

869
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:26,139
she saw the pictures in my room and got suspicious,

870
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:28,139
and snuck inside my car

871
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:30,040
in order to investigate me.

872
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:35,039
She heard the bullets and came outside.

873
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:39,839
Then protected the brown haired girl, who had a gun pointed at her.

874
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:43,039
They probably thought they were shot

875
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:46,339
and both passed out.

876
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:48,039
Geez.

877
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:51,339
I don't know if you can say they got guts or not.

878
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:54,639
Then, I'll leave the rest up to you.

879
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,239
Just go ahead and explain to them that

880
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,039
you're an FBI agent on a long leave of absence came to Japan

881
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:01,740
and got mixed up in a child kidnapping case.

882
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:06,139
Since that woman got away,

883
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:10,939
nobody would believe anything we say anyway.

884
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:14,339
The big guy behind all this hasn't come up front yet.

885
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:16,639
And besides I can't have

886
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:21,340
that girl with the brown hair see me yet.

887
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:56,339
"Seems that I gave you too much freedom before."

888
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:59,439
"Return to me immediately, Vermouth."

889
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,240
Okay, boss.

890
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,440
Now...

891
01:05:10,441 --> 01:05:12,739
This child.

892
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:14,339
What shall do with this child who thinks

893
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,840
he is capable of doing everything?

894
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,240
The electrodes of an ECG monitor?

895
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:42,339
There is a tracing device as well as a recorder.

896
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:43,739
Don't tell me that

897
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,939
the sound of the telephone I made just a while ago was.

898
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:48,639
Don't.

899
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,439
If you pull that out,

900
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,239
it means that my heart has stopped

901
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,239
and the mail address of the boss you sent an e-mail to

902
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,539
will be disclosed to my friend.

903
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:03,139
The telephone company must protect the privacy of their clients.

904
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,539
But the police

905
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:08,039
can get that information if they fill out a special form

906
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,439
and have one of the higher-ups put a seal on it,

907
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,739
then have the information disclosed before several witnesses.

908
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:16,639
If the call that was received was not from a cell phone,

909
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,539
but a regular home phone, even the address would be disclosed!

910
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:21,639
In other words,

911
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,239
if the sound just now is recorded

912
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:26,639
and analyzed to decipher the alphabets and number,

913
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:31,139
the name of your boss, as well as his whereabouts can be tracked down!

914
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,639
That is, even if I were to be killed!

915
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:34,739
Well,

916
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,739
I did figure that if you found Sherry,

917
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:41,139
who you guys are going nuts looking for,

918
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:45,240
you would unmistakably contact your big boss.

919
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,339
Since things began to look dangerous for Ms. Jodie,

920
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:52,040
I had to change my plans.

921
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:55,540
So, what are you going to do now?

922
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,039
My friends are waiting for contact from me

923
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,940
at a distant place from here.

924
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,439
If you don't want this to go out,

925
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,639
take me to your boss!

926
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,940
Let's get things over with once and for all, Vermouth!

927
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:18,240
I want to stop playing hide-and-seek already!

928
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,839
Okay.

929
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,539
I lost.

930
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:28,940
I'll give up going after Sherry.

931
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,439
It's mere sleeping gas.

932
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,039
You idiot!

933
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,439
If you do something like this, you'll suck in the gas too.

934
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,739
Yes. This is a gamble.

935
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,739
If you get up first,

936
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:51,439
you go ahead and call the police and have me arrested,

937
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:55,139
then go raid the boss along with them.

938
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:58,239
You already know what happens

939
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,940
if I get up first, don't you?

940
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,340
Bad news!

941
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,439
I've got to go wake him up right away.

942
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:09,740
Shinichi!

943
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:20,440
Shinichi...

944
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,539
You guys were blasted by Shuichi Akai?

945
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:53,539
Yes.

946
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:55,339
He just happened to find us by,

947
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:58,439
and Calvados ended up with three broken ribs.

948
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:02,039
You mean that FBI agent that you failed to get rid of

949
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,239
back in New York a year ago,

950
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:08,239
when you disguised yourself as serial killer.

951
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,939
I thought he'd be off his guard if he figured

952
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:12,640
I was just an ordinary killer, but...

953
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,539
I should've gotten rid of him back then

954
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:20,040
even if I had to risk being killed myself.

955
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:40,039
Our boss said that

956
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,639
that person

957
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:46,740
could be our silver bullet.

958
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,740
He is to be feared.

959
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:58,739
A silver bullet that capable to kill us in one shot

960
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:00,739
doesn't exist.

961
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:04,439
At any rate, I'm in a phone booth on route 20,

962
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,739
so can you come pick me up?

963
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:10,139
I got into a bit of trouble,

964
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:11,839
and can't move.

965
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,440
Before that, I have something I want to ask you.

966
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:20,740
Do you know a kid by the name of Shinichi Kudo?

967
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:25,739
No.

968
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,439
I don't.

969
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,740
Why did you save me?

970
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:33,939
Who needs a reason?

971
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:36,239
Why would a person want to save another then?

972
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:39,740
There is no logical reason for that either, is there?

973
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,240
Yes, it's him.

974
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:54,139
He, the one who pierced through our heart,

975
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:55,940
could prove to be him.

976
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,639
The one that we have long awaited,

977
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,640
the silver bullet.

978
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,339
"Next Episode."

979
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:21,139
At any rate, we'll have to figure out

980
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:24,739
what this mark that Ayumi drew is.

981
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:25,940
Hey!

982
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:30,940
The mark on Genta's butt sure looks familiar.

983
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:42,639
Next Conan,

984
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,840
"Look for the Mark on the Buttocks (Part 1)"

985
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,139
Next Conan's Hint:

986
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:06,839
"Emblem."

987
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,439
How did you like the first two hour and a half special?

988
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,139
It's been nine years since the Detective Conan series has been aired.

989
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,740
Keep tuning in on us, okay!
