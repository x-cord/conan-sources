1
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:38,534
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

2
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:40,434
are slashed by the light of deduction.

3
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:42,334
The stage of this episode is at Aso in Kumamoto, the Land of Fire.

4
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,234
Search for the secret data.

5
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:45,834
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:47,834
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:50,234
His name is Detective Conan!

00:02:18,654 --> 00:02:24,454
"Fire and Water Mystery Tour (Aso Edition)"

9
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:26,054
"Kumamoto Station"

10
00:02:26,054 --> 00:02:28,054
Accompanied by Ran and Pops Kogoro,

11
00:02:28,054 --> 00:02:30,754
we, the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

12
00:02:30,754 --> 00:02:33,554
came on a sightseeing tour to Kumamoto.

13
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:38,554
Kumamoto is blessed by a rich water source

14
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:40,254
and is Japan's number one clear underground water city.

15
00:02:40,254 --> 00:02:41,654
"Kumamoto Shintoshin Plaza"

16
00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:42,854
What a surprise

17
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:46,354
that mineral water comes out from an ordinary faucet.

18
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:50,554
-It's delicious. -Yeah!

19
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:56,554
But Kumamoto is known after all for...

20
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:59,354
Red bull steak and rare horse meat,

21
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:01,454
and spicy lotus root!

22
00:03:01,454 --> 00:03:03,754
They go deliciously well with Kuma Shochu.

23
00:03:03,754 --> 00:03:06,354
Drinking it in one gulp.

24
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:08,654
No, I wasn't referring to food.

25
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:12,654
I would like a healthy Taipien.

26
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:17,454
When it comes to Kumamoto...

27
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:19,654
Look! Conan!

28
00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:22,254
It's Mt. Aso!

29
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:25,954
Right. As well as being the city of water,

30
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:28,054
Kumamoto is known as the land of fire.

31
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:30,254
"Aso Volcano Museum" -Before going to see the crater,

32
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:33,454
let's study about the volcano here.

33
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:35,154
What?

34
00:03:38,554 --> 00:03:40,454
Fantastic!

35
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:44,054
Well, Genta's the most delighted here.

36
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:45,454
Mt. Aso is in fact what most people call it by,

37
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:48,354
but it is actually composed of 5 mountains:

38
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:49,754
Takadake,

39
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:51,354
Nakadake,

40
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:53,154
Nekodake,

41
00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:54,954
Eboshidake,

42
00:03:54,954 --> 00:03:56,554
Kishimadake,

43
00:03:56,554 --> 00:04:00,454
and it is formally called "Aso Gogaku".

44
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:03,754
The place where the volcanic crater we're headed for now

45
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:05,554
is Nakadake, right?

46
00:04:11,154 --> 00:04:12,654
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:12,654 --> 00:04:14,454
Are you okay, sonny?

48
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,154
Yep, I'm fine.

49
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:18,954
Besides, don't call me sonny.

50
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:20,354
I'm Justin.

51
00:04:20,354 --> 00:04:22,754
Justin Takamori.

52
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:25,054
Justin?

53
00:04:25,054 --> 00:04:26,754
Cute.

54
00:04:26,754 --> 00:04:28,854
Yeah, a lot of people tell me that.

55
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:33,554
But you're cuter than me, miss.

56
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:35,654
Huh?

57
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:37,954
That smile, that wink...

58
00:04:37,954 --> 00:04:41,954
He knows that doing that would make any lady fall for him.

59
00:04:41,954 --> 00:04:44,954
A rival appears.

60
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:48,154
But you're number 2, miss.

61
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,054
Then, who's number 1?

62
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:52,454
Of course, it's mommy!

63
00:04:52,454 --> 00:04:53,854
Justin!

64
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:57,554
I told you not to go off on your own, didn't I?

65
00:05:00,354 --> 00:05:02,154
I'm sorry, mommy.

66
00:05:02,154 --> 00:05:06,654
Right! I'll show you guys something good.

67
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:08,254
Something good?

68
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:13,954
Wow, super!

69
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:16,554
You sure collected a lot of stamps.

70
00:05:16,554 --> 00:05:19,054
You can say that again!

71
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:21,054
He's still a kid doing stuff like that.

72
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,054
Gosh. What an obnoxious brat.

73
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:25,454
Did you say something?

74
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:26,954
Not really.

75
00:05:26,954 --> 00:05:28,454
You're the brat.

76
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:31,554
My, he sure is a cute little child.

77
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:33,454
Thank you.

78
00:05:33,454 --> 00:05:34,954
Forgive me for forgetting to introduce myself.

79
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:38,054
I'm a detective, you see.

80
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:41,754
My name card...

81
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:42,954
Huh?

82
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:46,154
My shiny name card... Where is it?

83
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:48,554
Let's get going, shall we, Justin?

84
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:50,554
Say bye to your friends.

85
00:05:50,554 --> 00:05:52,854
Okay, mommy.

86
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:54,554
See you.

87
00:05:58,354 --> 00:06:01,454
Found it! This is who I am...

88
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:05,154
Huh?

89
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:08,054
What're you doing, Dad? We're going.

90
00:06:08,054 --> 00:06:09,054
Okay.

91
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:11,254
"Aso Ropeway Station" -Next, we're finally

92
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:12,954
going to the crater!

93
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,154
This is something!

94
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:31,354
It's really impressive!

95
00:06:37,854 --> 00:06:41,454
We don't get to see this crater at all times, you know.

96
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:43,254
We're lucky.

97
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:44,854
Huh? Why?

98
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:48,554
It's because Nakadake here is an active volcano.

99
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:51,654
It emits poisonous gas sometimes,

100
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:55,254
so there are times when this place is off limits.

101
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:56,454
True.

102
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:59,754
It was worth coming, being that we got to see this!

103
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:04,654
"Aso Cuddly Dominion" -There are many animals here!

104
00:07:04,654 --> 00:07:06,654
-Let's go! -Yeah!

105
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:10,654
It's a stuffed Kumamon doll!

106
00:07:10,654 --> 00:07:12,654
May I go take a look?

107
00:07:12,654 --> 00:07:16,054
But if we buy things first, we're going to have to carry them

108
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:17,354
so let's take a look on our way back.

109
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,254
I see.

110
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:20,654
Okay!

111
00:07:20,654 --> 00:07:23,354
Mr. Bear...

112
00:07:23,354 --> 00:07:26,854
So she says, but she'll probably forget to buy it anyway.

113
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:33,154
Look, look!

114
00:07:33,154 --> 00:07:35,754
It's begging for food!

115
00:07:43,054 --> 00:07:44,554
Go! Hurry up!

116
00:08:27,154 --> 00:08:29,654
Boy did I eat!

117
00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:32,054
He can really eat, can't he?

118
00:08:33,354 --> 00:08:34,954
Huh?

119
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:42,054
The man just left Kumamon behind

120
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,854
and took the bag with him.

121
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:47,954
Okay! Nab him as soon as the crowd subsides!

122
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:50,154
-Be really careful... -Please wait!

123
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,954
-There's a child. -What?

124
00:08:51,954 --> 00:08:54,454
Sir!

125
00:08:54,454 --> 00:08:56,454
This is yours, isn't it, sir?

126
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:58,254
Darn it!

127
00:08:58,254 --> 00:08:59,954
Hold it!

128
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:07,554
Ayumi!

129
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:14,554
I'm not letting you get away!

130
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:25,654
Precocious brat?

131
00:09:25,654 --> 00:09:27,654
Outta the way!

132
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:28,654
Watch out!

133
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:30,154
Mommy!

134
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:37,354
Justin...

135
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:40,654
Hold it!

136
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,654
Hey, are you okay?

137
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:52,354
It's you again?

138
00:09:52,354 --> 00:09:56,154
Justin, did you hurt yourself?

139
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:57,654
I'm fine!

140
00:09:57,654 --> 00:09:59,554
The ground being grassy saved me.

141
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:01,654
What a relief.

142
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:07,754
Where's my Kumamon?

143
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:10,954
Without it, my company is...

144
00:10:10,954 --> 00:10:13,854
My company is finished.

145
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:15,254
What on earth happened?

146
00:10:15,254 --> 00:10:16,854
I wonder.

147
00:10:16,854 --> 00:10:18,954
There! Now, you're okay!

148
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:20,254
Yep.

149
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:22,454
What on earth should I do?

150
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:25,354
I'll have to get it back, or else...

151
00:10:25,354 --> 00:10:28,054
What on earth is going on?

152
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:30,854
Are you that child's guardian?

153
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:33,254
Yes, I guess you could say so.

154
00:10:33,254 --> 00:10:37,954
Let me introduce myself. This is my business card.

155
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:40,054
Kogoro Mouri.

156
00:10:40,054 --> 00:10:43,254
You mean you're that great detective.

157
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:44,354
The way I see it,

158
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:47,754
it seems that we've interfered with your investigation.

159
00:10:47,754 --> 00:10:52,154
If it's okay with you, won't you tell me what happened?

160
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:55,409
The thing is 2 days ago,

161
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:59,809
my company Kumamon Foods was burglarized.

162
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:01,609
Kumamon Foods?

163
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,409
Kumamon...

164
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:08,909
I'm Monkichi Kumada, "Kumamon" in short.

165
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:12,209
I've been called by this nickname ever since I was a kid!

166
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:15,909
I see. So, you're the original "Kumamon".

167
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,309
President, did you call for me?

168
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:21,209
You're late, Inoue!

169
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:22,509
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:25,209
But why are the police here?

171
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:26,809
I called them!

172
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:29,109
Never mind that. Just explain to him

173
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:32,609
the circumstances of when the burglar broke in.

174
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,609
Yes, sir. When I arrived at the office in the morning,

175
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:37,809
I found that the lock of the door had been broken.

176
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:40,609
So, I rushed to check out the office,

177
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:42,809
but it didn't look particularly messed up or anything.

178
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:44,709
So I was sort of relieved.

179
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:48,909
But my stuffed doll Kumamon was missing.

180
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:52,209
Kumamon's Kumamon.

181
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:53,809
Not only that,

182
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:57,609
but I had this bad premonition, so I looked inside the desk,

183
00:11:57,609 --> 00:11:59,609
and found that the memory stick with

184
00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:03,509
confidential information of the company inside it was gone.

185
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:06,009
The data was of a completely new candy

186
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:07,809
that our company originally developed,

187
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:10,609
having a new sensation and new taste.

188
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:13,409
It was still pending patent.

189
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:15,609
A small and minor business like ours

190
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,709
have to keep on making new items,

191
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:20,509
and make ends meet by attaining patents for them.

192
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:24,409
But if that development data is stolen by another company...

193
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:28,109
like Higo Foods, a major company in this business,

194
00:12:28,109 --> 00:12:30,609
we're finished!

195
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:32,609
And anything from the culprit?

196
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:34,009
Yeah.

197
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:37,309
The following day, we got a call from the culprit.

198
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:41,209
I want you to buy the USB memory stick

199
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:43,609
with vital data in it for 10,000,000 yen.

200
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:45,309
If you report this to the police,

201
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:48,109
the negotiation is off, understand?

202
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:51,909
And today was that day of the deal, right?

203
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:56,409
Yes. The culprit told us that he would put the USB memory stick

204
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,809
with confidential data in it inside the Kumamon doll

205
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:02,509
and exchange it for the bag with 10,000,000 yen in it.

206
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:05,709
Why did the culprit do something so roundabout?

207
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,709
He probably just wanted to spite me.

208
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:10,609
What shall we do, president?

209
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:13,709
The culprit said that if we report this to the police,

210
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,309
the deal is off, right?

211
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:16,509
Shut up!

212
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:19,909
The police said that they'll nab the culprit at all cost!

213
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:21,709
And yet, they...

214
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:27,609
Koda here!

215
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:29,509
I nabbed the man that fled!

216
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,609
I confiscated the stuffed doll!

217
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:34,409
I see! Good work!

218
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:35,909
You look pale.

219
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:37,409
Does your wound still hurt?

220
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:39,009
Wound?

221
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:42,609
Detective Koda was stabbed by a robber and hospitalized.

222
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:44,909
He was just discharged yesterday.

223
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:47,409
No, it's not that.

224
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:51,009
The fact is there was no USB memory stick

225
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:54,009
inside the doll that the man had.

226
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:56,509
-What? -That's ridiculous!

227
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:58,609
Doesn't that man have it on him?

228
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:00,609
No, he didn't have it.

229
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:01,809
Besides, the man says that

230
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:04,009
he was asked by a man that he happened to meet at a bar to go

231
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:08,009
and exchange the doll for the bag,

232
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:10,109
and insists that he knows nothing at all.

233
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:13,109
Then, he saw what the culprit looked like, didn't he?

234
00:14:13,109 --> 00:14:16,009
The thing is, he says the man was wearing sunglasses and a mask

235
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:17,609
so he didn't see his face.

236
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:20,309
-Darn it! -Could it be that the culprit was planning

237
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:22,909
to just get hold of the 10,000,000 yen to begin with,

238
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:26,409
without putting the USB memory stick inside the doll?

239
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,609
Officer.

240
00:14:29,609 --> 00:14:31,509
When the man fled,

241
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,809
he bumped into a little child, didn't he?

242
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:37,009
Yeah, a cute American-Japanese boy.

243
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:41,109
He also had the same kind of Kumamon doll.

244
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:42,109
What?

245
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:44,609
So, maybe the dolls switched

246
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:47,409
when they bumped into each other, no?

247
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:49,309
-Is that true? -Yes, sir.

248
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:53,309
It's true that there was a non-Japanese mother and son.

249
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,509
Okay! Go look for them on the double!

250
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:00,009
But we don't have a clue as to where to look for them.

251
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:03,209
In fact, we know that boy.

252
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,109
-What? -It's Justin.

253
00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:07,309
Then, do you know where they went?

254
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:10,209
Nope, I don't.

255
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,509
But Justin had a stamp book.

256
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:15,509
So, I think they headed for a place

257
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:17,209
where he could collect more stamps.

258
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,609
But there are many sightseeing places around here

259
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:22,909
that will give you stamps, you know.

260
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:25,509
Yep, but...

261
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:30,209
he showed us his stamp book at the Aso Volcano Museum.

262
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:31,909
At that time, he already had the stamp

263
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:37,209
for Aso ropeway and Aso farmland

264
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:39,409
so I guess those two places can be excluded.

265
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:40,709
I see.

266
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:45,209
Excluding those places, the sightseeing place nearest here,

267
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:48,009
I think would be Aso Shrine.

268
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:50,909
Do they give stamps there?

269
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:54,009
Yes, they do. But how amazing.

270
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:56,809
You have fantastic observation skills and a great memory!

271
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:59,309
I guess so!

272
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:01,809
Okay! Take that child along with you

273
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:03,409
and head for Aso Shrine.

274
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:05,309
I'll head for Kumamon Foods

275
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:07,409
with President Kumada and the others.

276
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:10,309
Because the culprit may call.

277
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:11,309
Yes, sir!

278
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:16,609
And?

279
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,009
Why...

280
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:20,609
Does it have to turn out this way?

281
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:24,509
I want to find Justin no matter what!

282
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:27,709
Because I'm the one who got him involved.

283
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,609
It's not your fault, Ayumi.

284
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:31,609
Right! Don't worry about it.

285
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:33,109
We've got to do our thing here,

286
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:36,609
or we'll blemish the name of the Youth Detective Squad!

287
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:38,009
Yep.

288
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:40,809
I'll take responsibility for them!

289
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:42,909
Please rush over to Aso Shrine!

290
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:44,509
All right!

291
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:51,509
"Aso Shrine"

292
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:59,209
A non-Japanese mother and son?

293
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:01,809
Yeah, I did see them.

294
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:03,209
Really, sir?

295
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:07,909
Yeah. About an hour ago, he stamped his book here.

296
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:10,109
No doubt about it. It's Justin.

297
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,809
-Yep! -But...

298
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:15,009
did they say where they were headed for next?

299
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:17,009
If I remember correctly,

300
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,409
I think he said something about

301
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:22,809
a place where "A big pig is lying asleep..."

302
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:27,109
What? A big pig is lying asleep?

303
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:30,309
There's a big black pig at Aso Milk Farm!

304
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:32,809
It's always sleeping, too.

305
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:35,109
-That's got to be it! -But...

306
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:37,309
Take a look at this, will you?

307
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:41,809
When tracing Justin's path up to now,

308
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:43,609
he visited Aso Volcano Museum,

309
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:46,409
Cuddly Dominion and Aso Shrine.

310
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:49,109
He's headed north.

311
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,909
But Aso Milk Farm is in the southwest direction, right?

312
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:55,509
True. It's true that it's in the opposite direction

313
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:56,709
when you look at the map.

314
00:17:56,709 --> 00:18:02,209
Besides, the Aso Milk Farm is only open till 16:00.

315
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:04,309
What time is it now, Ran?

316
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:07,409
Huh? 15:40.

317
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:09,809
It's pretty far from here

318
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:12,409
and even if they were to have left about an hour ago,

319
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:15,709
I don't think that they could've made it there before closing time.

320
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:18,409
Either way, it'll be closed for sure

321
00:18:18,409 --> 00:18:20,109
by the time we get there.

322
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:23,809
If they're headed north, there's the El Patio Farm.

323
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:26,809
I'm sure that there were no pigs there, though.

324
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:31,409
Other than that, major tourists sites to the north

325
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:35,709
are the Kuninomiyatsuko Shrine and Mt. Daikanbo.

326
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:38,209
Mt. Daikanbo?

327
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:39,409
I see!

328
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,909
Justin didn't say "A big pig",

329
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:44,309
but rather, "A big Buddha"!

330
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:46,309
What's a Buddha?

331
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:49,709
It's a deity. It's called Buddha in English.

332
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:52,809
Justin's mother is non-Japanese,

333
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:55,409
so I'm sure that's what he was taught to call it.

334
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:58,409
A big Buddha is lying asleep...

335
00:18:58,409 --> 00:18:59,709
That's...

336
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:01,809
It's the landscape of Aso that looks to be the dying Buddha

337
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:04,209
attaining Nirvana that can be seen from Mt. Daikanbo.

338
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:11,209
Mr. Kosugi! We've figured out where the child is!

339
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:12,409
It's Mt. Daikanbo.

340
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:15,509
No, he's just saying that

341
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:17,709
and it's not definite yet.

342
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:21,009
If he says so, I think there's no doubt about it.

343
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:26,709
"Mt. Daikanbo"

344
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:32,909
True!

345
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:35,209
It looks like Buddha is lying asleep!

346
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,309
We've got to hurry and go find Justin.

347
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:41,609
Yeah.

348
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:43,809
No! Don't!

349
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,109
This is Justin's!

350
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:48,809
Just what're you doing to mommy?

351
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:50,909
Give it back to me!

352
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:52,409
Hold it!

353
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:57,009
Let go of me! What do you think you're doing?

354
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:01,209
Watch out!

355
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:17,109
-Kajiyama! -Mr. Kosugi!

356
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:19,009
Please go after that car that just went by!

357
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:23,309
The child was kidnapped by the culprit!

358
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:24,809
What?

359
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:46,009
The culprit's planning to flee into Kumamoto City.

360
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:51,909
Kosugi here!

361
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:54,709
This is Inoue from Kumamon Foods!

362
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,909
I just got a call from the culprit!

363
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:57,909
What?

364
00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:02,309
"Don't come after me, or the child is dead!"

365
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:05,109
Darn it.

366
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:07,609
Kajiyama, stop pursuit!

367
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:09,309
Huh? But...

368
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,509
They seem to have gotten a call from the culprit

369
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:14,509
saying that the child will die otherwise.

370
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:17,009
Okay.

371
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:21,509
Justin! He tried to help me...

372
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:24,609
Don't worry. I'm sure he's okay.

373
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:28,609
Strange.

374
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:30,209
How on earth did the culprit know

375
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:33,409
that Justin was at Mt. Daikanbo?

376
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:37,009
Rather, how did the culprit know that the USB memory stick

377
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:40,909
was inside the doll that Justin was holding to begin with?

378
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:42,709
We found out that there'd been a switch

379
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:45,409
only after the man who fled got caught.

380
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:48,309
The ones that knew about this were us,

381
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:50,609
the officers of the Kumamoto Prefectural, Police-Officer Kosugi,

382
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,709
Officer Kajiyama,

383
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:55,909
Mr. Kumada of Kumamon Foods and Mr. Inoue.

384
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:59,309
But when the culprit kidnapped Justin,

385
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:01,809
Mr. Kumada and Inoue were at the company.

386
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:04,809
We were at the site of the crime, and we all have alibis.

387
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,609
Which means...

388
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:12,309
Is there an accomplice to the culprit among the people here?

389
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:17,409
And who on earth is the culprit?

390
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,509
"Next Episode" -A child was kidnapped?

391
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:44,509
What are the police doing?

392
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:46,709
Where are we going now?

393
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:48,409
Shut up and come with me!

394
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:51,009
I found it!

395
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:52,709
Intruder!

396
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:55,309
He's doing it on purpose.

397
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,509
To let us know where he is.

398
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:00,609
He's pretty smart.

399
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:03,609
I'm sure that they'll figure it out.

400
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,909
