1
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,690
Wow!

2
00:00:12,318 --> 00:00:15,817
This is called glamping instead of camping, isn't it?

3
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:18,717
So you already know all about it.

4
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:21,388
It was on TV the other day.

5
00:00:21,548 --> 00:00:26,398
Glamping is what you call camping in elegance and comfort.

6
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:29,528
Ran, let's have a ton of fun today.

7
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:31,278
Yeah.

8
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:37,907
I'm glad we only had to bring a change of clothes.

9
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:41,787
With camping, you have to bring a bunch of equipment.

10
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:45,667
Then we'd have to bring my dad.

11
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:48,207
What is he, your bag carrier?

12
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,298
I'm taking the picture.

13
00:00:54,658 --> 00:00:56,298
Yeah!

14
00:00:57,998 --> 00:00:59,178
Did you get it?

15
00:00:59,888 --> 00:01:01,967
Conan-kun, over here.

16
00:01:01,968 --> 00:01:03,438
Oh, coming!

17
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:06,227
Looks good.

18
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:07,398
Let me see.

19
00:01:08,088 --> 00:01:10,227
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness!

20
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:12,157
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills!

21
00:01:12,158 --> 00:01:14,107
Opulent camping and four curious strangers.

22
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:15,907
What will happen during their luxurious meal?

23
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:17,637
Always determining the one truth

24
00:01:17,638 --> 00:01:19,507
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

25
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:22,038
his name is Detective Conan!

26
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:10,364
The Glamping Mystery

27
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,364
It's huge.

28
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:16,414
Yeah.

29
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:17,815
Hooray!

30
00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:20,205
The beds are so fluffy.

31
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,914
Now let's have fun!

32
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:23,235
Yeah!

33
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:33,555
Let's eat.

34
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:38,375
What a luxurious dinner.

35
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,730
It's delicious.

36
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,979
I know. I can't believe that this is camping.

37
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,109
It's not. It's glamping.

38
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,609
What, kid? You're complaining when we brought you along?

39
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,390
Sorry.

40
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,370
Here you go.

41
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,159
How considerate.

42
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,880
Ran-neechan made chocolate cookies.

43
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,810
It's pretty.

44
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,820
What is this?

45
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,530
What is this? Is this a joke?

46
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,659
He's dressed like a woman, has sloppy scribbles on his face,

47
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,939
a crab leg in his mouth, and a note in his hand.

48
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,210
Ran-neechan, call an ambulance.

49
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,949
And the police.

50
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,270
Okay.

51
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,439
Hello? Please come immediately.

52
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,630
We're at the Okuhoku Glamping Park.

53
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,890
He's dead.

54
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,140
Tosaki-san?

55
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,750
What on earth happened?

56
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,600
Honey...

57
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,590
How did this happen?

58
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,400
I didn't do this.

59
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,780
There's more.

60
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,819
Did you know him?

61
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,879
What?

62
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,419
Oh, yeah. I guess so.

63
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,200
H-He's my husband.

64
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,559
Did you do something to this person?

65
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,500
Well...

66
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,339
I'm sorry! I just scribbled on his face...

67
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,669
But I didn't kill him!

68
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,510
Tanabe-san, you, too?

69
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,550
"Too?"

70
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,819
Which means you did something, too?

71
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,550
What?

72
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,140
What?!

73
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,965
My name is Tosaki Kyoko.

74
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:47,925
Tosaki Kyoko (38) Victim's Wife

75
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:49,810
My husband's name is Tosaki Keidai.

76
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,999
He's the president of a small company.

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,549
We came here today with Miura-san

78
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:00,700
to eat the cooking of my husband's friend and chef Tanabe-san.

79
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,989
I'm Tanabe Hiroshi.

80
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,700
I'm a chef here at the facility.

81
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,230
President Tosaki has been a regular here for a long time.

82
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,469
I'm Miura Mika.

83
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,840
I'm a makeup artist.

84
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,899
I worked with Tosaki-san the other day.

85
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,079
I did makeup for some promotional photos.

86
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,850
He really liked my work,

87
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,349
so he invited me here today as a reward.

88
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,019
He was having so much fun this afternoon.

89
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,730
Look, we have photos.

90
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,209
We took all of these.

91
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:41,370
We went canoeing, had Chef Tanabe's special barbecue for lunch,

92
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,490
and relaxed with tea and snacks from Miura-san.

93
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,750
How did this happen to your husband?

94
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,370
I don't know.

95
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,870
I stepped away from our room, and when I returned...

96
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,260
Honey?

97
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,010
I tried to scream, but then I noticed something.

98
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,410
What was it?

99
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,629
At this rate, I thought I might be blamed.

100
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,659
What?

101
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,520
So I decided to make it look like someone else was responsible.

102
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,900
Seriously?

103
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,280
I moved him to Tanabe-san's room.

104
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:24,910
Since I was there, I stuck a crab leg in his mouth so it would look like he did it.

105
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,160
That should do it.

106
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,829
How could you do that?

107
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,540
You're the one who left that corpse in my room?

108
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,209
Yeah, but...

109
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,579
But what?

110
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,879
Now, now.

111
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,050
Why did you put a crab leg in his mouth?

112
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,839
Because Tanabe-san is a chef, and it was in his freezer.

113
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,310
I thought the chef would be suspected if he had food on him.

114
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,900
Seriously?

115
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,690
Tanabe-san, what did you do?

116
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,690
Who, me? I...

117
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,190
When I returned to my room, I found Tosaki-san's body.

118
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,200
For some reason, he had a crab leg in his mouth.

119
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,269
I thought about calling someone, but then I realized something.

120
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,580
At this rate, I might be blamed.

121
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,790
So I decided to frame the girl with glasses who came with Tosaki-san.

122
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,919
And you call yourself human?

123
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,590
Calm down.

124
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,080
And then?

125
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,340
She said she worked with makeup,

126
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,359
so I took a pen...

127
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,449
And drew on his face.

128
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,600
It's makeup!

129
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,559
You don't respect my job, do you?

130
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,730
Doesn't sound like it.

131
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,729
Then you moved Tosaki-san to Miura-san's tent.

132
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,640
Yeah.

133
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:41,909
You're awful.

134
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,309
What about you, Miura-san?

135
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,740
What? Oh, I...

136
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,079
When I returned to my tent,

137
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,250
I found Tosaki-san's body with a crab leg in his mouth and scribbles on his face.

138
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,250
I thought about screaming, but at this rate, I thought I'd be blamed.

139
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,250
My wife did it

140
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,760
I wrote a dying message saying, "My wife did it."

141
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:09,140
I put the note in his hand and tried to carry him to his tent,

142
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,610
but he was too heavy, so I got tired and left him in the open.

143
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,419
If you're gonna do something, see it through.

144
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,229
Why did you say I did it?

145
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,059
I didn't mean any harm.

146
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,319
It's just, you know, usually it's the wife.

147
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,599
What?!

148
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,420
- More manhandling.
- I've had enough from you!

149
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:29,150
I don't want to be blamed either!

150
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,349
Now, now.

151
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,160
Someone died, you know.

152
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,410
What? You've got the worst character out of all of us!

153
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,879
Although you're pretty bad, too.

154
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,489
What was that?

155
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,670
That's enough!

156
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,420
I'm Megure from the MPD.

157
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,170
You're involved in this case?

158
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,909
Inspector Megure, Detective Takagi.

159
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:54,440
Conan-kun. You're always getting caught up in cases.

160
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:00,400
Why don't you tell us what happened?

161
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,440
I see. I get the picture.

162
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,949
Is there anything else you noticed?

163
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,660
Anything I noticed?

164
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,109
Ma'am, why did you put a crab leg in his mouth?

165
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,149
Oh, that? The truth is my husband was allergic to crab.

166
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,670
Allergic to crab?

167
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,229
He once accidentally ate a dish containing crab.

168
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,680
He narrowly escaped death.

169
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,930
Since then, he didn't even like to look at crab.

170
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,399
Was that...

171
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,009
Anaphylactic shock?

172
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,810
Anaphylactic...?

173
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:44,309
Dozens of people die every year from anaphylactic shock.

174
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,589
If first aid is administered immediately, they can be saved,

175
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,309
but if untreated, it can be fatal.

176
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,570
Huh.

177
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,839
Did anyone else know about that?

178
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,120
Yes, Tanabe-san would have.

179
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,969
Yeah, I knew.

180
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,090
The campground and Tosaki-san told me not to use crab.

181
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:09,069
I see. So you and the wife knew.

182
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,399
Why didn't you mention his allergy when you saw the crab?

183
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,530
Because nobody asked me!

184
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,479
Was that vile woman really trying to frame me?

185
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,860
It's hard to know what the wife was thinking.

186
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,090
Hey, did you know?

187
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,360
Those two were an awful couple.

188
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,679
What?

189
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,129
Publicly they acted like a happily married couple,

190
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,870
but behind the scenes they fought quite a lot.

191
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,220
The wife was pretty bad, but the husband was a scoundrel, too.

192
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,990
Maybe that young woman was the president's mistress.

193
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,449
Y-You can't be serious!

194
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,510
Why would I do that?

195
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,260
Tosaki-san just liked my work.

196
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,519
That's really all it was.

197
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Wait! Is there anything else you noticed?

198
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,040
No.

199
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,530
Based on their testimony, all three seemed to have motive.

200
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,999
If their relationship was as rocky as Tanabe-san said,

201
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,910
Kyoko-san has motive.

202
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:26,940
But Tanabe-san said nothing until now even though he knew Tosaki-san was allergic to crab.

203
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,869
And if Tanabe-san's deduction is right,

204
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:36,010
then it makes sense that Miura-san tried to frame Kyoko-san.

205
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:42,020
But the only thing that's certain is that someone is lying.

206
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,439
Good evening, forensics.

207
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,020
Ah, you're Mori-san's kid.

208
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,979
Did this person experience anaphylactic shock?

209
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,870
Yeah.

210
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,660
We haven't investigated it thoroughly yet,

211
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,099
but his expression, the scratches on his neck,

212
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,909
and the swelling around his mouth

213
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,639
indicate it's likely he suffocated from anaphylactic shock.

214
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,709
I see.

215
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,719
Anyway, I'm surprised you know that word.

216
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,920
Kogoro-no-ojisan taught it to me.

217
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,050
Thank you.

218
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,560
It's almost certain he suffocated from anaphylactic shock.

219
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,340
Which means...

220
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,400
If my deduction is right...

221
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,300
Found it.

222
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,350
How long are they going to make us wait?

223
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,579
Conan-kun, you were in the bathroom a while.

224
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,179
Do you have a stomachache?

225
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,420
I'm fine.

226
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,170
Hey, ma'am.

227
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,590
Ma'am?

228
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,229
I mean, miss?

229
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,789
Could you show me those photos from earlier?

230
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,470
Sure.

231
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,720
Here you go.

232
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,209
I'm gonna borrow this, ma'am.

233
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,480
I'm not a ma'am!

234
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,969
Hey, Ran-neechan.

235
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,990
Conan-kun, you should call her "miss."

236
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,030
Could you do me a favor?

237
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,010
Now I'm ready to go.

238
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,930
All that's left is to corner the culprit.

239
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:40,604
Excuse me, but how long do we have to stay here?

240
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:43,983
I've got work first thing tomorrow morning.

241
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:46,943
It's not like we can stay here anymore.

242
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:49,354
I'd like to get ready to leave.

243
00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:51,713
I'm going to get cold.

244
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:54,653
My skin will be ruined...

245
00:14:54,654 --> 00:14:57,864
If you can't determine the truth, there's no point in us staying here.

246
00:14:58,294 --> 00:15:01,193
It can't be helped. We'll stop for today.

247
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:02,624
Wait!

248
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:05,143
Wh-What?

249
00:15:05,144 --> 00:15:06,124
Inspector Megure,

250
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:08,023
I've solved the mystery.

251
00:15:08,024 --> 00:15:10,634
Would you mind if I explained it here?

252
00:15:10,854 --> 00:15:11,584
What?

253
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:14,483
Sonoko-san, you can't just...

254
00:15:14,484 --> 00:15:17,884
Very well. Let's hear what Sonoko-kun has to say.

255
00:15:18,244 --> 00:15:19,634
Thank you.

256
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:24,513
This case was supposed to be a simple murder.

257
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:27,523
However, the irresponsible people here

258
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:31,154
turned it into a bizarre and complicated matter.

259
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:34,673
Everyone avoided suspicion falling upon themselves

260
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:37,344
and framed someone else.

261
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:40,693
The wife Kyoko-san put crab in his mouth,

262
00:15:40,694 --> 00:15:43,383
the chef Tanabe-san scribbled on his face,

263
00:15:43,384 --> 00:15:46,664
and Miura-san left a dying message.

264
00:15:47,264 --> 00:15:51,424
Furthermore, each one of them abandoned the body in another suspect's room.

265
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:55,343
Detective Takagi, have you determined the cause of death?

266
00:15:55,344 --> 00:15:58,804
Yes. After examining the body based on their testimony,

267
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:04,284
it was determined that he suffocated due to anaphylactic shock caused by some crab he ate.

268
00:16:04,774 --> 00:16:07,814
If he experienced anaphylactic shock,

269
00:16:08,144 --> 00:16:11,533
then the culprit had to have known about his condition.

270
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:12,943
You can't be serious!

271
00:16:12,944 --> 00:16:15,843
I'm the one who told the police about the crab!

272
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:19,824
And I didn't put crab in any of Tosaki-san's food!

273
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:21,653
As you can see,

274
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:24,993
killing Tosaki-san using his allergy causes the two of you

275
00:16:24,994 --> 00:16:27,353
to immediately fall under suspicion.

276
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:28,584
You mean...

277
00:16:28,844 --> 00:16:29,764
Yes.

278
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:33,474
The person who was certain they wouldn't be suspected is the culprit.

279
00:16:34,004 --> 00:16:34,964
In other words,

280
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:39,844
the person who used Tosaki-san's crab allergy to kill him

281
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:42,724
was you, Miura-san.

282
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:48,533
You must've been shocked when the body you abandoned

283
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:51,393
came back to you, Miura-san.

284
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:53,923
I-I didn't do anything.

285
00:16:53,924 --> 00:16:58,614
Like I said before, I just met Tosaki-san through work the other day.

286
00:16:58,924 --> 00:17:00,263
Very well.

287
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:03,614
Let's begin by examining how you killed him.

288
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:09,783
Everyone, how would you feed crab to a person with a crab allergy?

289
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:11,103
That's it.

290
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:16,384
A person with an allergy would be careful to never eat that ingredient.

291
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:21,434
That's why you mixed it into the cookie dough.

292
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:25,053
Inspector Megure, here.

293
00:17:25,054 --> 00:17:25,894
What's this?

294
00:17:26,194 --> 00:17:29,304
It's a picture taken while they were eating lunch.

295
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:35,814
Those are cookies. You can see them clearly.

296
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:40,743
Miura-san, didn't you bake these cookies yourself?

297
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:42,073
Yes.

298
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:47,454
Tosaki-san was supposed to die then after eating the cookies.

299
00:17:47,824 --> 00:17:51,923
Even if crab was discovered in the cookies,

300
00:17:51,924 --> 00:17:56,164
as long as you claimed not to know about his allergy, it would be treated as an accident.

301
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:02,583
But things didn't go as planned, and he didn't die.

302
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:04,014
Why is that?

303
00:18:05,094 --> 00:18:08,523
Ma'am, did you remember something?

304
00:18:08,524 --> 00:18:11,354
They were a bit bitter.

305
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:13,703
It's not unreasonable.

306
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:20,114
You needed to use plenty of cacao to mask the smell and flavor of crab.

307
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:24,614
Tosaki-san probably chose not to eat the cookies

308
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,363
after he saw the expression of Kyoko-san, who ate one first.

309
00:18:27,364 --> 00:18:30,624
That's why you called Tosaki-san to your own tent

310
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:33,424
and made him eat the cookies.

311
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:46,793
Knowing you'd be suspected and their connection might be doubted,

312
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:51,264
you abandoned Tosaki-san in his tent.

313
00:18:51,624 --> 00:18:56,524
After that, as you all know, the victim's body was passed around.

314
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:00,654
Impressive reasoning.

315
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:03,113
But you fell one step short.

316
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:06,153
There's something crucial lacking from your deduction.

317
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:07,574
What do you mean?

318
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:11,834
Physical evidence. Where are these crab cookies?

319
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:15,894
Unfortunately, I ate all the cookies from this afternoon.

320
00:19:16,444 --> 00:19:18,093
Ran, do you have the cookies?

321
00:19:18,094 --> 00:19:19,334
Y-Yeah.

322
00:19:20,644 --> 00:19:21,334
What?

323
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:22,913
I-Impossible!

324
00:19:22,914 --> 00:19:26,484
Those are the cookies you offered this afternoon to—

325
00:19:28,414 --> 00:19:29,464
Wait!

326
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,764
Now the evidence is—

327
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:35,774
They're not bitter?

328
00:19:37,174 --> 00:19:38,274
Wh-What's that?

329
00:19:38,614 --> 00:19:42,103
Cookie fragments found in your room.

330
00:19:42,104 --> 00:19:47,694
What you ate were the chocolate cookies I happened to bake and bring.

331
00:19:47,914 --> 00:19:52,954
If the investigation continues, I'm sure your relationship with Tosaki-san will be established.

332
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:57,754
And if they examine those pieces of cookie, I'm sure...

333
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:02,464
I lost.

334
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:07,294
At first, we were just playing with fire.

335
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:08,464
But...

336
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:12,974
At some point, we needed each other.

337
00:20:13,354 --> 00:20:17,304
He said he'd leave his wife to be with me.

338
00:20:18,104 --> 00:20:22,384
We were happy until that day.

339
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:25,783
Keidai, have some. Come on.

340
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:29,443
Sorry. I'm allergic.

341
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:31,993
A little won't hurt.

342
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:34,384
I really can't.

343
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:39,004
What's wrong with you? I'm trying to feed you.

344
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:42,544
I'm serious! Are you trying to kill me?

345
00:20:43,004 --> 00:20:45,513
I don't have time for you!

346
00:20:45,514 --> 00:20:50,863
After that, I apologized and asked to get back together,

347
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:53,404
but Keidai refused.

348
00:20:54,014 --> 00:21:00,523
So I asked him to take me glamping with his wife instead.

349
00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:02,814
Miura-san, were you...?

350
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:06,913
That's right. I made a plan.

351
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:11,384
I was going to kill him and ruin you and your company

352
00:21:12,144 --> 00:21:15,564
using the crab that tore us apart!

353
00:21:17,284 --> 00:21:18,844
Miura Mika-san.

354
00:21:19,484 --> 00:21:23,084
You can tell us more at the station.

355
00:21:29,014 --> 00:21:31,973
Case closed.

356
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:34,763
And we've been cleared of suspicion.

357
00:21:34,764 --> 00:21:36,103
Hold on.

358
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:38,143
You're guilty as well.

359
00:21:38,144 --> 00:21:38,854
What?

360
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:42,863
Tanabe Hiroshi-san, Tosaki Kyoko-san.

361
00:21:42,864 --> 00:21:47,493
We'd like to question you regarding the body you abandoned.

362
00:21:47,494 --> 00:21:49,024
What?!

363
00:21:50,654 --> 00:21:52,164
Well, yeah.

364
00:23:17,434 --> 00:23:19,713
So good!

365
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:21,473
I can't believe she used the crab like that.

366
00:23:21,474 --> 00:23:23,774
The crab's innocent.

367
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,163
What is it, Conan-kun?

368
00:23:27,164 --> 00:23:34,094
They must've really hated the victim to do all of that to him.

369
00:23:37,164 --> 00:23:38,543
It was a scary case.

370
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:39,594
Yeah.

371
00:23:47,114 --> 00:23:51,233
I've looked after this place since your father was here.

372
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:53,404
What's with the cheap décor?

373
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:55,784
Judging by this pool of blood...

374
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:57,614
Yeah, definitely.

375
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,813
It's a locked room mystery.

376
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:01,614
What?

377
00:24:02,844 --> 00:24:04,413
Let me handle this.

378
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:10,623
The great detective Mori Kogoro will solve this case within an hour.

379
00:24:11,174 --> 00:24:16,234
The next episode of Conan is "Mori Kogoro's Grand Lecture, Part One!"
