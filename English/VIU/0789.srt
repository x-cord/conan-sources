"Nichuri TV Office."

2
00:00:02,061 --> 00:00:05,660
You're saying that the drizzling rain will stop soon?

3
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:07,860
Yes, based on the weather chart,

4
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:08,861
I've calculated everything

5
00:00:08,862 --> 00:00:11,560
from the direction of the wind, measured the temperature and humidity,

6
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:15,060
the difference in elevation, atmospheric pressure and so forth.

7
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:16,460
As a result...

8
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:18,961
The weather will clear up in an hour.

9
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:22,860
How bold of you.

10
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:25,560
Just as expected of a genius beautiful weather forecaster

11
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:28,060
who is known to be 100 percent correct!

12
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,860
I'm impressed.

13
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:34,960
But, you too, make deductions on the job, don't you, Mr. Mouri?

14
00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:37,160
Well, certainly,

15
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:38,161
in order to disclose the shrewd treats

17
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:44,360
Treats?

18
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:45,861
Oh, boy...

19
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:51,760
I'm sorry. He's capable when he wants to be.

20
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:53,860
Oh, no. No problem. He's hilarious.

21
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:55,660
-Right? -Yes.

22
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:57,560
I'm sure it'll turn out to be a good program.

23
00:00:57,561 --> 00:00:59,161
Wonderful.

24
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,260
Tricks.

25
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:06,160
Yes, no matter what kind of trick

26
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:07,760
or suspicion there may be,

27
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:10,461
I can clear things up in an hour!

28
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:17,760
The years we've walked hand in hand serves as a springboard.

29
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:20,160
Let's move full speed ahead without slowing down!

30
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:22,060
A super popular weather forecaster.

31
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:23,960
It's hard to predict whether it's an accident or a case.

32
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:25,560
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:27,460
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:29,561
His name is Detective Conan!

00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:17,716
Gosh.

37
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:21,916
You can clear any trick or suspicion in an hour.

38
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:25,017
Just because she's good looking, I think you're taking it a bit too far.

39
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:30,417
Where's the glasses kid?

40
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:33,917
True.

41
00:03:33,918 --> 00:03:37,116
I think it's kind of hard for Pops to figure things out in an hour.

42
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,317
What?

43
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:44,916
I heard it with my very ears so there's no mistake about it.

"Yasumi Sekine (27), Charisma Weather Forecaster."

45
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:48,816
Okay, thank you.

46
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:52,016
"Yukio Kodama (49)" -Okay, see you then. Oh, right.

47
00:03:52,017 --> 00:03:55,416
I'll deliver the schedule plan for the new program right away.

48
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:57,517
I'll be looking forward to it.

49

"Takuya Yamaguchi (35), Yasumi's manager."

50
00:04:21,317 --> 00:04:24,716
Ms. Shinohara. Did you check the stage?

51
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:26,816
"Hiroko Shinohara (28)" -Yes, it's perfect!

52
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:30,816
It's off-limits for now so no one goes near it.

53
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:33,016
I see. Good work.

54
00:04:33,017 --> 00:04:34,716
Would you like to check it?

55
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:38,517
No, I trust your work.

56
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,416
All right then, Mr. Mouri,

57
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:50,516
please do come to my program again someday, will you?

58
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:52,317
Yes, my pleasure.

59
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:55,616
There you are... Yasumi.

60
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:58,816
You'll be filming right after break.

61
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:00,316
Okay.

62
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:01,417
See you then.

63
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:04,117
Goodbye.

64
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:10,116
Here, Pops, I got this for you.

65
00:05:10,117 --> 00:05:11,617
Thanks.

66
00:05:12,717 --> 00:05:13,717
This...

67
00:05:13,718 --> 00:05:15,916
Did you drink out of it?

68
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:19,716
Does Yasumi have more work to do from now?

69
00:05:19,717 --> 00:05:23,616
Yes, she has to film an image video on the next floor.

70
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:25,717
This is the sketch of the image.

71
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:30,916
She makes a breezy appearance onto the foggy stage

72
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:34,516
in the heavy snow.

73
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:38,016
How nice. The image of a weather forecast is being depicted, right?

74
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:40,916
She's a weather forecast queen.

75
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:43,617
I'm sure she sells well.

76
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:46,916
So, shall we head on home?

77
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:48,017
-Yes. -Yes.

78
00:05:57,217 --> 00:05:58,717
Pops! Over there!

79
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:02,317
Yasumi?

80
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:06,217
Ms. Sekine?

81
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:12,816
Yasumi...

82
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:14,816
Don't move!

83
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:16,017
Stay right there.

84
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:30,317
Only the hair on her left side?

85
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:37,816
Pops! Over there.

86
00:06:37,817 --> 00:06:39,816
What's that?

87
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,616
Wait a second...

88
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:43,816
Maybe...

89
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,816
A dying... dying message?

90
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:47,616
Which means...

91
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:48,716
Call the police!

92
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:50,616
Hurry, call the police.

93
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:51,917
This is...

94
00:06:53,117 --> 00:06:55,616
Yasumi's hairpin decoration.

95
00:06:55,617 --> 00:06:57,417
Why is it over there?

96
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:01,916
Yeah... It seems she died instantly

97
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:04,416
from the shock of the fall.

98
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:06,016
But, why?

99
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:08,917
I wonder if there was something defective with the set.

100
00:07:11,617 --> 00:07:13,216
You were the last one to check the set,

101
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:15,317
weren't you, Shinohara?

102
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:18,316
Yes, it was I...

103
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:20,717
But, I found nothing wrong in particular...

104
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:25,716
First of all, this is the producer, Mr. Yukio Kodama,

105
00:07:25,717 --> 00:07:30,416
he is Mr. Takuya Yamaguchi, the manager of the victim, Ms. Yasumi Sekine,

106
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,016
she is the Assistant Director, Ms. Hiroko Shinohara.

107
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:36,016
These three were near the site during the incident.

108
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:38,316
According to the staff,

109
00:07:38,317 --> 00:07:41,316
this building is scheduled to be taken down next year

110
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:44,616
because of deterioration from age.

111
00:07:44,617 --> 00:07:46,216
I see.

112
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:48,616
Inspector, I got it.

113
00:07:48,617 --> 00:07:52,416
After Yasumi had the talk with me, she took a break.

114
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:55,616
Then, she was scheduled to film a video.

115
00:07:55,617 --> 00:08:00,616
However, she decided to check this stage before taking a break.

116
00:08:00,617 --> 00:08:02,716
She leaned against the railing back then,

117
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:05,116
but since the railing was deteriorated from age,

118
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,916
she fell to the first floor.

119
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:09,816
In other words...

120
00:08:09,817 --> 00:08:11,416
It's an accident?

121
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:15,216
Yes, very likely.

122
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:17,616
Well, I guess there was no need

123
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:19,716
to call you all the way out here, Inspector.

124
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:24,916
Then, what about the dying message or whatnot that Yasumi left behind?

125
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:27,316
She probably scratched the floor

126
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:29,816
with her blood smeared hands just before dying

127
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:31,316
and left something like that behind.

128
00:08:31,317 --> 00:08:33,716
It hurts...

129
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:36,816
I've been pricked by the thorns of the roses.

130
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:39,616
Hey, brat! How come you're over there?

131
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:41,417
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:44,617
I'm tangled to the tinsel this time!

133
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:46,917
Just what do you think you're doing?

134
00:08:49,017 --> 00:08:52,716
There's a burst balloon over there.

135
00:08:52,717 --> 00:08:54,316
Come to think of it, Pops,

136
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:55,516
didn't we hear the sound of a bang,

137
00:08:55,517 --> 00:08:58,417
like something burst before the scream?

138
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:02,217
Yeah... If I remember correctly, a bang...

139
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:05,016
A balloon... A tinsel...

140
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:06,117
Roses?

141
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,616
What's the matter?

142
00:09:12,617 --> 00:09:14,416
Isn't it enough already?

143
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:18,016
We've got to change the set of the studio right away.

144
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:20,816
Besides, when Ms. Sekine fell,

145
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:22,916
everybody was over that side.

146
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:25,416
We have nothing to do with it.

147
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:26,816
Right? Don't you think so?

148
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,016
-Yes. -Yes.

149
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:30,316
All right. See you all then...

150
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:31,417
Wrong!

151
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:37,316
You can't deceive the eyes of Kogoro Mouri here.

152
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:41,317
This looks to be an accident but it's not.

153
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:45,716
Just what do you mean, Mouri?

154
00:09:45,717 --> 00:09:50,116
Somebody set a trap against Yasumi.

155
00:09:50,117 --> 00:09:51,117
A trap?

156
00:09:51,118 --> 00:09:55,117
Yes, there was something like this decorated on stage.

157
00:09:56,717 --> 00:10:01,317
First, you tie the tip of this tinsel to the pillar.

158
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,916
Furthermore, you take this end of the tip and tie it

159
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,616
onto the pillar opposite the stage.

160
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:07,016
Okay!

161
00:10:07,017 --> 00:10:09,917
Ran! Walk on stage, will you?

162
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:12,716
Over here... Please...

163
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:14,217
Okay...

164
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:27,316
Everyone, just before you heard Yasumi's scream,

165
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:29,516
you heard this sound, didn't you?

166
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:31,416
Yeah.

167
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:35,516
Right, Yasumi who came to check this stage,

168
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:39,417
fell right into this malicious trap.

169
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:43,617
She was then surprised and staggered over to the railing...

170
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:50,616
Which means this is homicide after all.

171
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:54,216
No, it's impossible to deliberately make her fall

172
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:55,816
by just doing something like this.

173
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:59,816
The person who set the trap just wanted to scare her.

174
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:03,716
And that, brought about this tragedy.

175
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:07,116
Then, who on earth set up a trap like this?

176
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:09,816
What time was the stage ready for use?

177
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:11,516
Well...

178
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:13,616
Mr. Yamaguchi, if I remember correctly,

179
00:11:13,617 --> 00:11:17,016
you said that you would be here until morning?

180
00:11:17,017 --> 00:11:18,616
Yes...

181
00:11:18,617 --> 00:11:20,716
Is something wrong?

182
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:22,616
The fact is...

183
00:11:22,617 --> 00:11:25,516
I inadvertently dozed off.

184
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:26,616
By the time I got up,

185
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:28,816
they were just about to start filming the program.

186
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:30,516
Dozed off?

187
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:34,316
Yes but I couldn't tell Yasumi about it.

188
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:36,016
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:36,017 --> 00:11:38,216
That doesn't tell us anything

190
00:11:38,217 --> 00:11:40,616
about who and when the trap was set up.

191
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:44,517
Then, who was the last one to check the stage?

192
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:47,916
It was me.

193
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,716
The last time I check it was...

194
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:51,416
But, I didn't find anything wrong in particular...

195
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:55,116
You said that nothing was wrong back then, right?

196
00:11:55,117 --> 00:11:56,916
Are you sure?

197
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:57,917
Yes.

198
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,616
Well, the thing is...

199
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:02,516
On the tinsel that was used for the trick,

200
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:05,217
this was pasted onto it...

201
00:12:06,117 --> 00:12:10,616
A masking tape like that can be found anywhere.

202
00:12:10,617 --> 00:12:13,416
Then, shall we check it out?

203
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:14,616
The fingerprints and footprints

204
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:17,416
that are near the place where the trap was set?

205
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:22,217
We could come up with a decisive proof of the perpetrator.

206
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:34,935
Inspector, the forensics.

207
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:36,036
Yes, sir.

208
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:38,835
We need to take fingerprints

209
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:40,336
and saliva from the three of you.

210
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:44,435
I refuse. I don't want to!

211
00:12:44,436 --> 00:12:46,135
Why not?

212
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:48,535
I can't do what I can't do.

213
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:51,335
That's enough, Shinohara! Cut it out!

214
00:12:51,336 --> 00:12:54,736
I know that you did it!

215
00:12:58,436 --> 00:12:59,735
I heard her.

216
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:02,435
When she was talking in the kitchenette of the company yesterday.

217
00:13:02,436 --> 00:13:04,135
How ruthless of Yasumi!

218
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:08,135
It's impossible to change the set of the studio by tomorrow!

219
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:09,635
But, I've got to do it.

220
00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:12,335
It's not that I'm going to do it for nothing, though.

221
00:13:12,336 --> 00:13:16,335
I'm going to embarrass her tomorrow.

222
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:18,535
With a balloon.

223
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:21,235
I didn't want to embarrass our company

224
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:23,635
so I hesitated from saying anything about it till now.

225
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,735
Hiroko, is what he just said true?

226
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:30,036
Yes. I set the balloon up!

227
00:13:31,536 --> 00:13:34,235
I hated her!

228
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:36,635
She always went around acting like a queen

229
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:38,235
and was so selfish.

230
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:40,735
Right? Don't you think so too, Mr. Yamaguchi?

231
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,336
She got to you too, didn't she, Mr. Yamaguchi!

232
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:47,235
If something goes wrong on the set next time,

233
00:13:47,236 --> 00:13:49,536
disappear from in front of my eyes!

234
00:13:52,136 --> 00:13:54,736
She was arrogant and egotistical...

235
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:59,235
It's unlike my image!

236
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:01,735
Fix by tomorrow!

237
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:03,635
Just like she did to me,

238
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:05,535
I wanted to embarrass her in front of everyone.

239
00:14:05,536 --> 00:14:11,736
By surprising that snob and making a laughingstock out of her!

240
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:16,336
But, I didn't expect...

241
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:20,136
I didn't expect what happened.

242
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:25,036
Please come to the police station with us.

243
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:27,935
Yes.

244
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:31,535
What is it? Something's not right...

245
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:34,236
The other sound that was heard back then...

246
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:38,136
And, her hair that was disheveled just on one side.

247
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:41,236
The hairpin decoration that flew.

248
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:47,235
This is...

249
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:49,236
A smoke machine.

250
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:52,136
I see.

251
00:14:57,736 --> 00:14:59,336
It... It come!

252
00:15:01,636 --> 00:15:02,935
Dad.

253
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,435
Something's wrong, right, Mr. Mouri?

254
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:07,235
With the deduction up to now?

255
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:11,036
No, unusually my deduction is correct.

256
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:14,535
It's correct? Unusually?

257
00:15:14,536 --> 00:15:16,835
Oh... Pardon me...

258
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:20,635
The fact is there's still a continuation to my deduction.

259
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:23,536
Because there are several questions still left unanswered.

260
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:25,536
Several questions?

261
00:15:25,537 --> 00:15:28,435
Yes. I heard from Conan that.

262
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:32,935
Yasumi said that she wouldn't be checking the stage.

263
00:15:32,936 --> 00:15:37,635
But, she actually checked it and fell for the trap.

264
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,635
Don't you think it's strange?

265
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:40,835
True.

266
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:42,735
However, if you think of it this way,

267
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:45,035
everything falls into place.

268
00:15:45,036 --> 00:15:48,736
Yasumi already knew about the trap!

269
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:52,335
Hold it, how did she?

270
00:15:52,336 --> 00:15:55,535
Because the real perpetrator told her about it.

271
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:57,435
The real perpetrator?

272
00:15:57,436 --> 00:15:58,535
Right.

273
00:15:58,536 --> 00:16:02,135
That perpetrator told Yasumi beforehand.

274
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:04,935
That a balloon trap had been set up,

275
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:07,635
and that the balloon would burst before the filming.

276
00:16:07,636 --> 00:16:08,835
Hiroko...

277
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:11,835
To make a laughingstock out of you.

278
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:13,935
To make a laughingstock out of me?

279
00:16:13,936 --> 00:16:17,035
Yes, Yasumi was going to make fun and be mean to you

280
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:19,836
more than she had ever done before.

281
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:26,635
Furthermore, the perpetrator also told her that

282
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:29,435
if she stood at a distance, towards the railing,

283
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:31,835
she would be safe.

284
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:36,036
Yasumi worked the balloon trap just like she was told to.

285
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:40,435
Of course, Yasumi wasn't surprised.

286
00:16:40,436 --> 00:16:42,035
However, the next second,

287
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:46,335
the other trap that the real perpetrator had set up was activated.

288
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:48,035
The other trap?

289
00:16:48,036 --> 00:16:50,635
Yes. Hey, Conan!

290
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:54,235
The snow falls heavily and the fog sets in.

291
00:16:54,236 --> 00:16:56,635
The queen of the weather forecast,

292
00:16:56,636 --> 00:16:59,635
that was Yasumi's stage, right?

293
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:03,136
Look here! There is a machine here.

294
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:06,935
A smoke machine?

295
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:10,435
Right, a machine to eject fog.

296
00:17:10,436 --> 00:17:13,335
The other question that was left unanswered

297
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:16,735
was the wind like sound

298
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,736
that was heard right after the bang of the bursting sound.

299
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:28,236
I'm sure that there are some of you here that heard it.

300
00:17:30,536 --> 00:17:33,235
The perpetrator using the sound of the balloon that burst as a signal

301
00:17:33,236 --> 00:17:36,335
turned on the switch of the machine.

302
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:39,435
The output volume was set at maximum.

303
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:43,635
Officer Takagi, will you please turn the switch on?

304
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:45,135
Yes, sir.

305
00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:46,136
What?

306
00:17:48,136 --> 00:17:49,535
This is...

307
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:55,335
The real perpetrator showered Yasumi with carbon dioxide gas fog,

308
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:57,835
with tremendous impact.

309
00:17:57,836 --> 00:18:00,335
Yasumi couldn't even open her eyes,

310
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:03,435
she had no choice but to back down.

311
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:06,835
However, right behind her was the loose railing.

312
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:10,435
The railing was probably rigged to come off beforehand.

313
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:13,735
So, Yasumi went falling to her death.

314
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:15,435
Hold it, Mr. Mouri...

315
00:18:15,436 --> 00:18:18,135
There's no proof that she was showered with something like that.

316
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:21,135
Carbon dioxide gas evaporates right away.

317
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:25,535
However, only the left side of Yasumi's hair was disheveled.

318
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:26,835
Furthermore, her hairpin decoration

319
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:29,535
had flown all the way to the wall beyond.

320
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:33,435
The carbon dioxide gas was ejected to the left side of her,

321
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:36,235
and that's probably why her hairpin was blown off.

322
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:39,535
In other words, the perpetrator worked his trick

323
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,735
and masked it behind the trap that Hiroko set up.

324
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:46,935
That way, thanks to her, he was taken off the suspect list.

325
00:18:46,936 --> 00:18:48,635
Then, Mouri...

326
00:18:48,636 --> 00:18:51,335
Who is the real perpetrator?

327
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:53,235
It's simple...

328
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:56,435
The one who knew about Hiroko's plan,

329
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,335
Mr. Kodama.

330
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:01,735
You said that you heard her, didn't you?

331
00:19:01,736 --> 00:19:04,035
Are you saying that I did it?

332
00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:07,635
Just because I eavesdropped, that makes me the perpetrator?

333
00:19:07,636 --> 00:19:12,535
Not only that, but you secretly told Yasumi about it,

334
00:19:12,536 --> 00:19:14,735
and lured her to the trap.

335
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,935
That's enough! Do you have proof?

336
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:21,536
You're wearing a great brown suit today.

337
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:25,535
Your shoes are brown too, and you sure look dandy.

338
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:28,835
Did you polish your shoes this morning?

339
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,535
So, what if I did?

340
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,535
It's drizzling today. Humidity is also high,

341
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:37,236
so the cream that you used on those shoes didn't dry too well.

342
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:40,635
The ejection hole of the smoke machine

343
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:43,035
was most likely faced towards the loose railing.

344
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:45,635
After the crime was committed, the perpetrator had to find the time

345
00:19:45,636 --> 00:19:48,735
to return the hole to its original position.

346
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:50,735
The traces of the cream that was left behind at that time,

347
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:54,835
the brown cream was found on the machine!

348
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:56,435
Wrong...

349
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:58,335
That won't serve as evidence!

350
00:19:58,336 --> 00:20:00,435
Ms. Shinohara.

351
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:01,535
Yes.

352
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:03,735
How do you turn on the switch of the machine?

353
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,235
It can be done manually or by wireless.

354
00:20:06,236 --> 00:20:07,835
Wireless?

355
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:09,235
Officer Takagi!

356
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:12,535
Don't! Cut it out!

357
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:14,235
I found it!

358
00:20:14,236 --> 00:20:15,935
Why do you have that on you?

359
00:20:15,936 --> 00:20:17,335
Darn.

360
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:19,936
Mr. Kodama. Why?

361
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:28,735
The woman really sucked!

362
00:20:28,736 --> 00:20:30,435
She found out,

363
00:20:30,436 --> 00:20:33,635
that I embezzled money from the program.

364
00:20:33,636 --> 00:20:36,935
She got proof of it and blackmailed me.

365
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,935
She would ask me to appoint her to new programs

366
00:20:38,936 --> 00:20:41,435
or to provide her with production expenses.

367
00:20:41,436 --> 00:20:43,935
She'd ask me repeatedly, over and over.

368
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:47,235
I wasn't about to be at her beck and call all my life.

369
00:20:47,236 --> 00:20:51,235
But, I didn't think that the drizzle would give me away.

370
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:52,935
Drizzle?

371
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:55,335
You're wrong, Mr. Kodama.

372
00:20:55,336 --> 00:21:00,135
I had another reason for thinking that you committed the crime.

373
00:21:00,136 --> 00:21:03,635
Yasumi realized just before she fell.

374
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:06,435
That she had been deceived by you.

375
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:09,935
So, she used whatever strength that was left in her

376
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,035
to leave behind a dying message.

377
00:21:13,036 --> 00:21:16,035
By using something that wouldn't be found by you and erased...

378
00:21:16,036 --> 00:21:18,235
A special symbol.

379
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,935
A weather symbol.

380
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:22,235
Snow. (Pronounced as "Yuki" in Japanese)

381
00:21:22,236 --> 00:21:24,435
Yes, Mr. Yukio Kodama,

382
00:21:24,436 --> 00:21:28,236
you're the only one with the word "snow" in your name!

383
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:32,335
I see.

384
00:21:32,336 --> 00:21:35,035
Just as would be expected of a weather forecast queen.

385
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:37,235
Darn.

386
00:21:37,236 --> 00:21:38,736
That woman...

387
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:43,635
It's cleared up.

388
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,335
Just as Yasumi had predicted.

389
00:21:46,336 --> 00:21:50,236
And I solved the case in an hour too.

390
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:13,935
I'm glad it cleared.

391
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,035
Yes.

392
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:17,435
But, I wonder what the weather will be like tomorrow,

393
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:19,535
dad?

394
00:23:19,536 --> 00:23:21,335
Tomorrow's weather?

395
00:23:21,336 --> 00:23:22,435
He can't forecast it, no way.

396
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:26,535
Pops can deduce cases but he can't forecast the weather.

397
00:23:26,536 --> 00:23:28,835
What! I'll show you I can...

398
00:23:28,836 --> 00:23:32,536
What will tomorrow's weather be?

399
00:23:37,636 --> 00:23:39,636
-It'll be a fine day tomorrow too! -It'll be a fine day tomorrow too!

400
00:23:42,936 --> 00:23:46,635
"Next Episode."

401
00:23:46,636 --> 00:23:48,636
Die! Kanzaki!

402
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:54,735
Just because he was wearing the Bekapon outfit.

403
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:56,235
Bekapon?

404
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:59,835
It's the mascot character of Beikado.

405
00:23:59,836 --> 00:24:03,135
Are you suspecting our employees?

406
00:24:03,136 --> 00:24:05,035
This mistaken bomb scare incident

407
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:07,635
is full of things that can't be explained.

408
00:24:07,636 --> 00:24:13,036
