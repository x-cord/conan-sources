1
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:20,567
If all cases were men,

2
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:22,367
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

3
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:23,867
Today, we spend 60 minutes with Heiji!

4
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:25,767
A serious deduction battle!

5
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:27,267
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:27,267 --> 00:00:29,067
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:31,567
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,254 --> 00:01:54,454
Inspector!

9
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:56,854
We just got word from Chiba

10
00:01:56,854 --> 00:01:58,754
that they found the victim's name.

11
00:01:58,754 --> 00:02:00,554
Oh, is that right?

12
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:03,054
He was hired by and working part-time

13
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:04,654
at a construction company in the Saitama Prefecture.

14
00:02:04,654 --> 00:02:07,054
His name is Mr. Kengo Shibamiya.

15
00:02:07,054 --> 00:02:10,154
Mr. Shibamiya seems to have been the person who first found

16
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:12,554
the body of the president of a construction company in Saitama,

17
00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:15,154
who was poisoned to death in a case that occurred last week.

18
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:16,954
When Mr. Shibamiya returned from lunch

19
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:19,054
that he had together with his part-time colleagues,

20
00:02:19,054 --> 00:02:21,254
he found the president who had been murdered.

21
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:23,054
The item used to kill the victim

22
00:02:23,054 --> 00:02:24,054
was the same as what was used in this case,

23
00:02:24,054 --> 00:02:27,354
a candy drop laced with hydrogen cyanide.

24
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:29,354
Taking into consideration that the room was not messed up at all,

25
00:02:29,354 --> 00:02:32,654
but that all the money in the safe was stolen,

26
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:35,254
the Saitama Prefectural police are pursuing

27
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:38,754
personnel of the company who would've known that

28
00:02:38,754 --> 00:02:41,654
the president liked candy drops,

29
00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:43,254
and that after lunch he would return to his room

30
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:44,954
and count the money in the safe.

31
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:46,654
I see.

32
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:49,554
It's highly likely that the culprit

33
00:02:49,554 --> 00:02:51,454
asked Mr. Shibamiya who was killed in this case,

34
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:54,454
about the president's likes and action patterns,

35
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:56,754
and used the knowledge to commit the crime.

36
00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:59,354
By the way, it seems that the president was scheduled to meet

37
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:02,354
a man who was to be newly hired by the company that day.

38
00:03:02,354 --> 00:03:05,854
If Mr. Shibamiya and the culprit are childhood friends,

39
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:09,354
then Mr. Shibamiya must've introduced them to each other.

40
00:03:09,354 --> 00:03:14,354
And? Did that Mr. Shibamiya come from the Kansai area after all?

41
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:17,054
Yes, it seems he told his colleagues

42
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:19,654
he was born and raised in Osaka.

43
00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:22,054
It seems he lied about his age saying he was in his 40s,

44
00:03:22,054 --> 00:03:24,854
and his name could also be an alias.

45
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:26,954
In other words, the three suspects

46
00:03:26,954 --> 00:03:32,354
all fall in the same age bracket, huh?

47
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:34,354
So, we already know that

48
00:03:34,354 --> 00:03:37,654
somebody from Kansai is among the three of you!

49
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:39,954
If you're from Kansai, why don't you come right out

50
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:41,954
and identify yourself like a person from Kansai would!

51
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,554
Heiji! You're being unreasonable!

52
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:45,954
What're you all worked up about?

53
00:03:45,954 --> 00:03:47,754
Why wouldn't I be all worked up?

54
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:50,454
I'm in the lead for now, you know.

55
00:03:50,454 --> 00:03:53,254
In the lead?

56
00:03:53,254 --> 00:03:55,154
I've got to solve the case fast

57
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:57,454
or he'll take the credit for this case again.

58
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:58,454
What?

59
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:01,554
You've figured out who the culprit is, Shinichi?

60
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:07,454
Yes, I got it!

61
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:10,954
I'll tell everybody that deduction!

62
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:13,254
Is that call from the detective brat?

63
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:14,854
Oh, yes.

64
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,654
Hey, give me the phone, Conan!

65
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:19,854
Oh, sorry. I hung up.

66
00:04:19,854 --> 00:04:21,354
Geez!

67
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:24,154
And, what did Kudo tell you?

68
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:25,754
Oh, yes.

69
00:04:25,754 --> 00:04:28,254
Although the three suspects all said that

70
00:04:28,254 --> 00:04:31,154
they were born and raised in Tokyo,

71
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:33,154
he told me that there is a person

72
00:04:33,154 --> 00:04:35,254
who is hiding that he is from Kansai,

73
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:38,354
and that this person is the culprit!

74
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:44,254
Just as would be expected of Kudo!

75
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:46,254
Hey! Hold it there!

76
00:04:46,254 --> 00:04:48,254
You're from Tokyo!

77
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,854
What do you know about the people of Kansai?

78
00:04:50,854 --> 00:04:55,454
You know it wasn't me, it was Shinichi who said that.

79
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:58,654
He said not the tables are turned and he hit a counter homerun.

80
00:04:58,654 --> 00:05:00,154
I tell you.

81
00:05:00,154 --> 00:05:03,054
He doesn't know much about baseball and yet...

82
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:04,354
Oh, that's right!

83
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:07,654
Shinichi told me to ask the person at this restaurant

84
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:10,654
to make a certain thing!

85
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:12,154
A certain thing?

86
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:14,654
Something about you'd be able to tell

87
00:05:14,654 --> 00:05:16,854
if the person is from Kansai or not as soon as he drinks it.

88
00:05:16,854 --> 00:05:19,154
It seems to be a magic dish!

89
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:20,954
A magic...

90
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,354
dish?

91
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:30,354
This is miso soup, isn't it?

92
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:32,354
You seriously want us to drink it?

93
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:35,854
Well, if you say you can figure out the culprit

94
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:37,854
if we drink this, I'll do so.

95
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:41,254
Drink it in one gulp as much as you can!

96
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:48,154
Oh, and I had a bowl made for everybody else

97
00:05:48,154 --> 00:05:49,954
while I was at it,

98
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:52,054
so why don't you drink some too, Heiji?

99
00:05:52,054 --> 00:05:54,554
What is he up to?

100
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,154
How does he expect to figure out who the culprit is

101
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:58,054
doing something like this?

102
00:06:03,454 --> 00:06:04,554
"Karai"! (Salty)

103
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:06,154
What's with this miso soup?

104
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:07,554
You can say that again!

105
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:08,854
I always thought that the food in Tokyo

106
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:11,254
had strong tasting miso in them but...

107
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:13,454
It's just as they say,

108
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:16,954
I can't drink anymore of this "karai" (salty) stuff.

109
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:21,154
What?

110
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:23,054
Isn't it "karai" (salty) for you guys?

111
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:24,254
No.

112
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:27,354
It's true that it's a bit salty

113
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:29,754
but more than "karai"...

114
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:32,354
It's "shoppai" (salty), right?

115
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:34,054
"Shoppai"?

116
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:35,354
The people of Tokyo

117
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:39,054
refer to spicy food such as curry and Mabo Tofu

118
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:40,854
as "karai" (spicy hot)

119
00:06:40,854 --> 00:06:42,554
but when it comes to salty food,

120
00:06:42,554 --> 00:06:44,654
they say, "shoppai"! (Salty)

121
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,354
So, Mr. Amakasu who referred to the miso soup

122
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:49,754
and salt tasting ramen as "karai"

123
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:51,854
is from Kansai!

124
00:06:52,854 --> 00:06:55,154
What? Are you serious?

125
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:58,254
Then, you don't say that sea water is "karai"?

126
00:06:58,254 --> 00:07:00,554
We either say it's "shiokkarai" or "shoppai".

127
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:04,154
That's just a simple error in choice of words!

128
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:07,054
I really wanted to say "shiokkarai"

129
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:10,354
but just happen to say what that boy from Osaka said.

130
00:07:10,354 --> 00:07:13,854
Oh, and the sound you used at the end of your sentence.

131
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:15,454
It's ordinary Tokyo dialect

132
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:17,354
like you just used a while ago too, brat!

133
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,654
People from Tokyo don't use the phrase "Tokyo dialect"!

134
00:07:20,654 --> 00:07:24,154
People from Kansai are the only ones who say that, right?

135
00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:25,954
You don't say that, do you?

136
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:29,554
No.

137
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:30,954
Well, I found out for the first time

138
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:34,054
that putting "sa" at the end of a sentence is used in Tokyo, but...

139
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,754
I thought so too.

140
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:38,454
That it was just ordinary colloquial Japanese.

141
00:07:38,454 --> 00:07:42,054
Well, it seems that most people from the Kanto area

142
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:44,254
say "sa" at the end of a sentence.

143
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:47,054
If you insist that I talk funny,

144
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:49,554
that man was talking funny too?

145
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:53,054
He said that he was going to eat the sweets for dessert!

146
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:56,654
But you ordered assorted fruit, didn't you?

147
00:07:56,654 --> 00:07:58,554
That's not sweets!

148
00:07:58,554 --> 00:08:02,154
I was referring to fruit.

149
00:08:02,154 --> 00:08:03,454
Huh?

150
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:04,754
Oh, don't you say that?

151
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:06,954
Aren't fruit called sweets?

152
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:10,454
I don't use it, but I know what you mean.

153
00:08:10,454 --> 00:08:12,854
At the end of the menu of high class Japanese style restaurants,

154
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:15,554
the word "sweets" is written.

155
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:17,654
Is that also Tokyo dialect?

156
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:19,654
A word from the Edo era!

157
00:08:19,654 --> 00:08:22,454
The only ones who use it even now are the Edoites.

158
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:25,154
You said that sweets will make you fat,

159
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:27,154
Heiji because you thought it was candy,

160
00:08:27,154 --> 00:08:29,454
so you don't use this word in Osaka, right?

161
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:31,254
That's why...

162
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:34,254
no matter how you look at Mr. Amakasu,

163
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:38,854
you can tell that he's from Kansai!

164
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:40,354
Hey, Kudo.

165
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,454
Besides, you seem to have been holding your cigarette

166
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:45,154
with you left hand, mister,

167
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:47,954
But, aren't you actually right-handed?

168
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:49,154
Because you put the chopsticks

169
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,554
you used for the ramen on your right!

170
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:54,654
-Hey, cut out that way of talking! -It's easy to explain

171
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:58,454
the reason for why you did all these things deliberately!

172
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,954
You were afraid

173
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:01,754
to hold the cigarette with the right hand

174
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:03,654
that you grabbed the poisoned candy drop with, right?

175
00:09:03,654 --> 00:09:07,354
-Hey, it's about time... -That's enough, you!

176
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:09,654
Using that strange Kansai dialect of yours.

177
00:09:09,654 --> 00:09:11,254
What's with you, idiot?

178
00:09:11,254 --> 00:09:14,054
-Kan... -Kansai dialect!

179
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:19,854
Oh, well...

180
00:09:19,854 --> 00:09:22,254
I just sort of copied the fighting style words

181
00:09:22,254 --> 00:09:24,254
that I hear a lot on TV.

182
00:09:24,254 --> 00:09:25,654
I got kind of annoyed

183
00:09:25,654 --> 00:09:28,454
because this brat started talking funny all of a sudden.

184
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:30,054
That's right.

185
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:31,854
It's characteristic of the people of Kansai

186
00:09:31,854 --> 00:09:33,054
to get annoyed

187
00:09:33,054 --> 00:09:35,254
when hearing Kansai dialect spoken incorrectly!

188
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:37,854
Because there are rarely any Japanese people

189
00:09:37,854 --> 00:09:40,554
who get angry at hearing people from abroad

190
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:42,554
speak funny Japanese, right?

191
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:45,954
And, you ordered ramen after committing the crime

192
00:09:45,954 --> 00:09:48,654
because you wanted a wet wipe, right?

193
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,354
You knew they'd give you one right away

194
00:09:50,354 --> 00:09:52,254
if you told them that you spilled some soup.

195
00:09:52,254 --> 00:09:54,654
You wanted a wet wipe to wipe the poison off your hand

196
00:09:54,654 --> 00:09:56,654
that you were planning to wash

197
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:59,554
after poisoning Mr. Shibamiya to death!

198
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:01,754
You didn't wash your hands in the restroom

199
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:03,554
because you heard running water

200
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:06,654
and noticed that someone was inside.

201
00:10:06,654 --> 00:10:08,154
You flushed the toilet, didn't you?

202
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:10,054
Yeah.

203
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:12,054
I heard a man groan so I did so,

204
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:15,454
before I left the toilet to check things out.

205
00:10:15,454 --> 00:10:16,954
I see.

206
00:10:16,954 --> 00:10:19,354
So, the footsteps of the culprit walking away

207
00:10:19,354 --> 00:10:21,354
was erased by the toilet being flushed.

208
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,054
But, why then did he hold the cigarette in his left hand

209
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:26,154
despite having wiped his hands with the wet wipe?

210
00:10:26,154 --> 00:10:27,754
Maybe because he wasn't sure

211
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:30,054
if all the poison was wiped off nicely?

212
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:32,354
Poison is invisible besides.

213
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:35,354
Since the wet wipe isn't on the table,

214
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:37,754
you put it inside the pocket of your clothes, right?

215
00:10:37,754 --> 00:10:40,654
I think if the police check that wet wipe,

216
00:10:40,654 --> 00:10:42,754
they'll be able to figure things out.

217
00:10:42,754 --> 00:10:45,754
They'll see that you're the one

218
00:10:45,754 --> 00:10:47,454
who used the poisoned candy drop

219
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:49,554
and killed Mr. Shibamiya!

220
00:10:49,554 --> 00:10:54,054
That's what Shinichi told me on the phone!

221
00:10:59,654 --> 00:11:00,854
Hey!

222
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:02,054
Out of the way!

223
00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:04,454
Oh, I don't think you should.

224
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:11,654
Shoots!

225
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:13,454
I don't think you should take her on either.

226
00:11:23,254 --> 00:11:25,554
That girl in pony tail's pretty good.

227
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,654
I warned you...

228
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,954
That you shouldn't.

229
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:40,054
Case closed.

230
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:48,654
Oh, you're back earlier than expected, Camel.

231
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:50,454
Was the case solved?

232
00:11:50,454 --> 00:11:51,654
Yes.

233
00:11:51,654 --> 00:11:53,254
It seems that a man

234
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,654
poisoned a president of some company for want of money,

235
00:11:56,654 --> 00:11:59,754
and since his friend was about to disclose the crime,

236
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:02,754
he called him out to the restroom to shut him up.

237
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:05,654
That seems to have been the truth of the case.

238
00:12:05,654 --> 00:12:08,454
And? This person that you sent a photo taken by cell phone.

239
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:09,554
What about this teenager?

240
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:11,754
Seems to be a high school student

241
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:14,054
who came to the scene of the crime with Conan and the others.

242
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:17,054
Any recognition, Jodie?

243
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:20,654
I feel as if we've met somewhere before.

244
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:22,254
I wonder.

245
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:25,154
Is this kid look familiar to you, James?

246
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:26,454
No.

247
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:30,154
I don't remember anybody like her.

248
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:31,354
Her?

249
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:35,954
Yes, I thought she was a boy, but she's a girl.

250
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:38,954
Huh? But, it's amazing that

251
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:40,554
you could tell that she's a girl.

252
00:12:40,554 --> 00:12:43,654
Well, I guess you could call it wisdom that comes with age?

253
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:45,554
I've polished my sense of things like these

254
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:47,954
through the years, you see.

255
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:51,454
This girl.

256
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:53,254
She resembles somebody?

257
00:12:55,254 --> 00:12:56,754
What?

258
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:59,554
Why is it a tie?

259
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:01,554
The one who saw through who the culprit was

260
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:03,654
and solved the case is Shinichi, right?

261
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:05,054
Were they competing with each other,

262
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:06,554
Heiji and Kudo?

263
00:13:06,554 --> 00:13:08,154
I guess so.

264
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:11,954
Well, it was Heiji who hit it off with the case,

265
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:14,154
because he is from Kansai.

266
00:13:14,154 --> 00:13:17,154
And Shinichi, the boy from Tokyo,

267
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:20,554
used that as a foundation to get to the truth of the case.

268
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:23,254
Therefore, I think a tie is fair enough.

269
00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:28,354
But I wonder if what Conan said a while ago is true?

270
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:30,554
About Kansai people getting angry over people

271
00:13:30,554 --> 00:13:33,454
who copy their way to talking.

272
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:35,254
You'd get angry too, wouldn't you, Ran,

273
00:13:35,254 --> 00:13:40,254
if I said thing like "Ano-sa" or "Ran sa"?

274
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:42,554
I wouldn't get mad.

275
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:44,754
On the contrary, I think I'd be happy.

276
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:48,554
In other words, it only goes to show that

277
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:51,254
people from Kansai are narrow-minded, after all.

278
00:13:51,254 --> 00:13:54,054
That's not true!

279
00:13:54,054 --> 00:13:55,854
Maybe it only goes to show that

280
00:13:55,854 --> 00:13:59,554
the people from Kansai cherish the language that they use?

281
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:01,454
Yes!

282
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:04,554
Yes, that's right!

283
00:14:04,554 --> 00:14:07,354
Oh, Ran, you used the Kansai dialect!

284
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:13,654
But that detective boy wasn't even at the crime site, so...

285
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:16,754
I guess he beat the other one?

286
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:19,554
Right!

287
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:20,754
Hey.

288
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:25,854
I'm gonna give away that you're Kudo, you know.

289
00:14:25,854 --> 00:14:26,954
Besides!

290
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:28,454
I'm telling you that you who made that guy

291
00:14:28,454 --> 00:14:32,054
use funny Kansai dialect is minus point, you idiot!

292
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:36,354
Well, I don't think overdoing it is good though.

293
00:14:36,354 --> 00:14:37,554
And?

294
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:40,754
What'd you come to Tokyo for?

295
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:09,154
Huh? You got a letter from a dead person?

296
00:16:09,154 --> 00:16:10,854
For Hattori?

297
00:16:10,854 --> 00:16:14,554
Yeah. That person, is my mother's acquaintance.

298
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:16,054
A person named Wakamatsu

299
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:19,254
who is the president of a design company in Tokyo.

300
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:21,754
I've met him several times before too,

301
00:16:21,754 --> 00:16:26,554
but it seems he was killed at a villa in Karuizawa.

302
00:16:26,554 --> 00:16:28,254
Killed?

303
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,254
Yeah.

304
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,954
I had Officer Otake of the Osaka Prefectural Police

305
00:16:30,954 --> 00:16:32,854
check on it for me.

306
00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:34,054
But, it just so happened that

307
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:35,654
they were having a birthday party

308
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:38,854
for Mr. Wakamatsu's wife that day at the villa.

309
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:41,354
The local police seems to think that a robber

310
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:44,254
who broke into the villa encountered Mr. Wakamatsu,

311
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:47,354
and as a result ended up killing him.

312
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:50,954
But, why would he send you a letter, Heiji?

313
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:54,254
Don't tell me that he sent it out before he was killed?

314
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:55,254
No.

315
00:16:55,254 --> 00:16:59,154
That letter is post marked ten days after the crime,

316
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:01,354
so I don't think he's the one who sent it out.

317
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,554
The name of the sender is Kohei Wakamatsu but...

318
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:06,854
the contents of the letter seems to have been written

319
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:08,454
by the culprit who killed him.

320
00:17:08,454 --> 00:17:09,754
The culprit?

321
00:17:09,754 --> 00:17:13,554
Yeah. This is what is written in the letter.

322
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:16,254
"Dear Heiji Hattori,"

323
00:17:16,254 --> 00:17:19,954
"I would like to see you, Mr. High School Detective"

324
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:23,554
"and confess the crime that I have committed."

325
00:17:23,554 --> 00:17:24,954
"But, even if I were to meet you,"

326
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:27,454
"I feel slightly doubtful whether you'd be able to"

327
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:29,454
"visibly see me or not."

328
00:17:29,454 --> 00:17:32,054
"Why? Because I am a warped entity"

329
00:17:32,054 --> 00:17:35,254
"that you people have made up on your own."

330
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,054
"I'm an illusionary figure that one cannot visibly see"

331
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:38,954
"under normal circumstances."

332
00:17:38,954 --> 00:17:40,754
"Despite this, if you'd still like to see me,"

333
00:17:40,754 --> 00:17:42,954
"I'll be waiting for you at the residence of the man"

334
00:17:42,954 --> 00:17:46,954
"that I have killed during the night of the next full moon."

335
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:49,554
And, at the end of the letter,

336
00:17:49,554 --> 00:17:53,854
Mr. Wakamatsu's address in Osaka is written.

337
00:17:53,854 --> 00:17:55,854
And along with...

338
00:17:57,754 --> 00:18:00,954
the key of the house was inside too!

339
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:07,454
That was the key to unlock the door to a new case.

340
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:11,454
To open the door to a horrendous serial killing case.

341
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:15,954
-I win the battle. -So, you think...

342
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:17,354
I'm going to win it after all.

343
00:18:17,354 --> 00:18:19,054
Hey...
