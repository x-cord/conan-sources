1
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:34,071
A dine and dash?

2
00:00:35,663 --> 00:00:37,352
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

3
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:39,612
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

4
00:00:39,613 --> 00:00:41,692
A dine and dash in Beika City?

5
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:43,662
A popular idol is behaving mysteriously!

6
00:00:43,663 --> 00:00:45,152
Always determining the one truth

7
00:00:45,153 --> 00:00:47,032
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

8
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:49,693
his name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:34,173
"The Idol Whose Smile Disappeared!"

10
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:44,643
Poirot

11
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:56,033
Detective Agency

12
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,473
Come in.

13
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:18,303
Excuse me.

14
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:23,832
Starting today, I transferred from the Haido City police box to the Beika City police box on 4-chome.

15
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,063
My name is Yamasato Futoshi.

16
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:28,212
Officer Yamasato?

17
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:32,693
There's a case I'd like you to crack, Detective Mori Kogoro.

18
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:34,062
Crack a case?

19
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:35,323
Yes, crack a case.

20
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,282
Our story begins with a single phone call I received

21
00:03:39,283 --> 00:03:42,333
at the Beika City 4-chome police box today.

22
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:46,833
Hello, this is Beika City 4-chome—

23
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,333
What? A dine and dash at a family restaurant?

24
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:52,623
I'll be right there!

25
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:55,733
I headed there immediately, but...

26
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:04,103
What? The dine and dash has been resolved?

27
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:08,092
Seconds before I arrived,

28
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:13,132
the blonde girl who dine and dashed returned with her mother to apologize.

29
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:15,363
Seconds before, huh?

30
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,232
We passed by each other.

31
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:22,422
When I arrived at the restaurant, I encountered a sobbing blonde girl and her mother,

32
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:25,373
who was supporting her, in front of the restaurant.

33
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:31,573
According to the mother, her daughter forgot her wallet and panicked.

34
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:34,182
So it's been solved, then.

35
00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:36,632
Why don't we have a drink to celebrate?

36
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:40,062
No, thank you. I'm currently on duty.

37
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,643
And besides, the case isn't over yet.

38
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:47,072
The problem is what the waitstaff said.

39
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:50,562
They claim the girl who dine and dashed

40
00:04:50,563 --> 00:04:54,653
and the girl who came to apologize seemed like completely different people.

41
00:04:55,563 --> 00:05:00,153
The girl who dine and dashed was a blonde wearing sunglasses,

42
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:07,163
but she seemed like a different person from the girl who just came to apologize with her mother.

43
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:09,382
What do you mean?

44
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:13,462
When I brought the chocolate parfait to her table,

45
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:15,922
I got a glimpse of her face.

46
00:05:15,923 --> 00:05:21,722
The smile she had then looked just like hers.

47
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:23,013
It's cold!

48
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:25,053
Her? You mean...

49
00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:31,643
Apparently her smile looked just like that of idol Kakurai Kayoko.

50
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:34,022
Kakurai Kayoko?

51
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:37,983
Actually... there was another similar case.

52
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:43,993
It happened three months ago at the police box in Haido City where I was stationed at the time.

53
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,188
(3 Months Earlier)

54
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,492
Hello, this is Haido City 5-chome.

55
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:51,753
What? A dine and dash at a ramen restaurant?

56
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,363
Yes. I'll be right there.

57
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:57,813
I headed there immediately, but...

58
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:02,043
What? The case has been resolved?

59
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:06,942
According to the owner, as in today's family restaurant case,

60
00:06:06,943 --> 00:06:11,143
it was a blonde woman in sunglasses who dine and dashed.

61
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:16,652
As soon as she finished eating her ramen, she suddenly ran off.

62
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:18,942
The owner immediately called it in,

63
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:26,153
but after ten minutes, the blonde and a woman claiming to be her older sister showed up.

64
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:32,393
According to the sister, her younger sister forgot her wallet and panicked.

65
00:06:36,343 --> 00:06:38,412
I see. Those are similar stories.

66
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:40,912
So, did the owner of the ramen restaurant also say

67
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:44,412
that the blonde with sunglasses looked like Kakurai Kayoko?

68
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:45,263
No.

69
00:06:45,263 --> 00:06:45,933
What?

70
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:53,202
That evening, at the Haido City Hall, there was a DDPP handshake event.

71
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:54,873
DDPP?

72
00:06:55,553 --> 00:06:59,193
It's the idol group Kakurai Kayoko belongs to.

73
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:04,443
Kakurai Kayoko is the star of DDPP.

74
00:07:05,413 --> 00:07:07,953
Her smile is remarkably cute.

75
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,203
Her popularity alone has exploded.

76
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:16,713
At the Haido City handshake event, there was a huge line in front of only Kakurai Kayoko's booth.

77
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:21,693
But apparently, the other members thought poorly of her.

78
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,723
On one occasion, they became jealous of the amount of gifts she received.

79
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,232
On another occasion,

80
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:44,523
they all ignored Kakurai Kayoko when she showed up late to a dance lesson.

81
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:49,033
On yet another occasion, in the powder room...

82
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:08,463
Due to that string of incidents, the smile finally disappeared from her face.

83
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:20,353
She was taken away in an ambulance.

84
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:28,123
That night, the blonde in sunglasses dine and dashed at a ramen restaurant in Haido City.

85
00:08:28,703 --> 00:08:30,842
I didn't get it at the time,

86
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:35,203
but after what the Beika City family restaurant waitstaff said today...

87
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:39,812
The smile of the blonde in sunglasses who dine and dashed

88
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:41,843
looked just like Kakurai Kayoko's.

89
00:08:42,713 --> 00:08:44,422
That's when it clicked.

90
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:48,862
The blonde in sunglasses who dine and dashed

91
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:51,973
at a Haido City ramen restaurant three months ago

92
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:55,723
may have been Kakurai Kayoko as well.

93
00:08:57,053 --> 00:09:02,733
After suffering the jealousy of the other DDPP members, Kakurai Kayoko was distraught.

94
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:10,153
She awoke in a hospital room and felt hungry.

95
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:14,163
She looked around the room and saw her bag there.

96
00:09:14,673 --> 00:09:20,663
Inside her bag were the blonde wig and sunglasses she wore onstage.

97
00:09:21,363 --> 00:09:25,953
Disguising herself using those, she left the hospital room

98
00:09:28,273 --> 00:09:30,173
wandered around the city at night,

99
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:38,083
and eventually dine and dashed at a ramen restaurant.

100
00:09:39,853 --> 00:09:43,682
Currently, Kakurai Kayoko is taking a break from the entertainment industry.

101
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,033
She's recuperating at a hospital in the countryside.

102
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:53,412
Did the distraught and recuperating Kakurai Kayoko leave the hospital in the countryside,

103
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:55,742
disguise herself as the blonde in sunglasses,

104
00:09:55,743 --> 00:10:00,073
and dine and dash at a Beika City family restaurant?

105
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:06,333
Great Detective Mori Kogoro, I'd like to ask you again.

106
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:09,343
Please crack this case!

107
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:16,452
Huh? What? Incredible!

108
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:21,732
He's already asleep and solving—no, masterfully cracking the case while he naps!

109
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:24,313
What?!

110
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,823
He's just asleep because he drank too many beers.

111
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:35,073
I'm home!

112
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:37,732
Dad, listen to this.

113
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:39,873
Just now, at Beika Park...

114
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:43,083
Sorry for interrupting.

115
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:46,333
I'm currently cracking a case.

116
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:47,892
Cracking a case?

117
00:10:47,893 --> 00:10:50,072
That's right. I'm cracking a case.

118
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:52,583
I asked for his help.

119
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:56,343
I'm Yamasato from the Beika City 4-chome police box.

120
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,853
Nice to meet you. I'm Mori's daughter Ran.

121
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:02,142
What case are you solving?

122
00:11:02,143 --> 00:11:05,103
More importantly, Ran, weren't you about to say something?

123
00:11:05,703 --> 00:11:08,103
Oh, right. I just saw her.

124
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:10,573
Saw who?

125
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:12,322
Kakurai Kayoko-chan.

126
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:13,243
What?!

127
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:14,153
What?!

128
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,673
You saw Kakurai Kayoko?

129
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:31,842
Where? Where did you see her?

130
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:35,173
Where? At Beika Park.

131
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,273
Tell me all about it!

132
00:11:37,903 --> 00:11:40,933
On my way home from school just now,

133
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,833
I was walking through Beika Park with my friends.

134
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:48,693
It looked like there was an on-location shoot for a drama or movie.

135
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:51,693
We wanted to see who was appearing in it,

136
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:55,193
so we searched the area.

137
00:11:55,643 --> 00:12:00,902
That's when we found a woman who looked like an attendant

138
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:02,703
standing in front of a van.

139
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:07,963
We were certain someone famous was inside.

140
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:14,583
We snuck behind the van without being seen by her and looked inside.

141
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:16,973
Start!

142
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:20,893
No.

143
00:12:22,473 --> 00:12:23,353
No.

144
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:26,393
No, no.

145
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:47,292
I think they were filming Kakurai Kayoko-chan's first movie

146
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:51,492
after returning from her hiatus.

147
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:54,472
How old was Kakurai Kayoko's female manager?

148
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,173
What?

149
00:12:56,113 --> 00:12:57,763
Around 40?

150
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:01,002
How old was her female attendant?

151
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:02,183
The woman's age?

152
00:13:03,303 --> 00:13:04,783
Around 20?

153
00:13:05,553 --> 00:13:08,532
That's about the same age as Kakurai Kayoko.

154
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:12,443
Um, I've got something to do, so I'm going to go.

155
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:19,953
It seems the thing I personally feared the most has happened.

156
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:26,903
The distraught and recuperating Kakurai Kayoko should've retired from the entertainment industry.

157
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:29,723
But her agency—no,

158
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:33,752
the entertainment industry is trying to force Kakurai Kayoko

159
00:13:33,753 --> 00:13:36,463
to return when she hasn't recovered yet.

160
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:39,463
Detective Mori Kogoro.

161
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:43,192
What I'm about to tell you are my personal thoughts.

162
00:13:43,193 --> 00:13:45,373
It's certainly not any kind of logical deduction.

163
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:47,183
Please listen.

164
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:54,253
Kakurai Kayoko came to Beika City in order to film her first movie after her return.

165
00:13:54,773 --> 00:13:59,733
However, her mental health had not yet recovered.

166
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:07,313
Unable to withstand the pressure,

167
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:15,753
she disguised herself as the blonde in sunglasses, left the shooting location,

168
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:21,513
and headed to a family restaurant where she dine and dashed on a chocolate parfait.

169
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:24,772
Later, in order to hide the truth,

170
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:26,792
her female manager and attendant disguised themselves

171
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:31,823
as a mother and daughter and went to pay her bill.

172
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:37,273
That's just me clumsily thinking aloud.

173
00:14:37,653 --> 00:14:40,632
I'd be delighted if you were able to use it for future reference.

174
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:44,783
Now then, Detective Mori Kogoro! Crack the case, please!

175
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:49,242
What do you want me to deduce after that?

176
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:50,543
Crack the case, please!

177
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:55,812
Does this guy just want to show off his detective skills to a famous detective?

178
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:56,972
Crack the case, please!

179
00:14:56,973 --> 00:14:57,543
Yikes.

180
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,442
Crack the case, please!

181
00:14:59,443 --> 00:15:01,053
Okay, okay.

182
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:04,803
Does this case really need a detective to crack it, anyway?

183
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,803
I shall crack this case.

184
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,973
Thank you—ow, ow.

185
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:13,643
I hit my head on your shoes. Ouch...

186
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:15,033
Shoes?

187
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:19,653
Conan, get in touch with Ran.

188
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:21,343
Okay.

189
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:28,803
What was up with that police officer?

190
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:34,792
What is it, Dad?

191
00:15:34,793 --> 00:15:39,332
Ran, where did Kakurai Kayoko's tears fall when you saw her inside the car

192
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,713
at the filming location in Beika Park?

193
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:43,933
Where were they falling?

194
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:53,143
On the red shoes she was wearing.

195
00:15:53,393 --> 00:15:55,523
What kind of shoes was her attendant wearing?

196
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:58,393
Her attendant's shoes?

197
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:02,903
They were sneakers.

198
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:06,342
Officer Yamasato, where did the crying daughter's tears fall

199
00:16:06,343 --> 00:16:10,163
while being held by her mother at the restaurant?

200
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,663
If they fell on sneakers, then the daughter was actually the attendant.

201
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:17,653
If they fell on red shoes, then it's possible that...

202
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:19,773
It's possible that...

203
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,473
Red shoes...

204
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:28,953
What?

205
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:30,793
What?

206
00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:32,113
Uh, excuse me.

207
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:33,693
What?

208
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:39,443
Was it Kakurai Kayoko herself who went to pay the bill?

209
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,132
The truth is stranger than fiction.

210
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:43,722
It's a bit odd for me to say,

211
00:16:43,723 --> 00:16:47,533
but allow to me admit that even I, the great detective Mori Kogoro,

212
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:48,770
am a bit surprised by this conclusion.

213
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:50,173
I can hang up now, right?

214
00:16:51,363 --> 00:16:54,822
The mother and daughter who went to the Beika City restaurant

215
00:16:54,823 --> 00:16:58,043
to apologize were the manager and Kakurai Kayoko herself.

216
00:16:58,313 --> 00:17:02,543
Does that mean Kakurai Kayoko isn't distraught?

217
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,173
Kakurai Kayoko is not distraught.

218
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:10,022
Three months ago, on the day of the Haido City ramen restaurant incident,

219
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:13,262
after suffering the jealousy of the other DDPP members

220
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:16,643
and being taken to the hospital,

221
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:20,273
as you deduced, Kakurai Kayoko woke up hungry,

222
00:17:20,743 --> 00:17:25,613
took the disguise in her bag and left the hospital room.

223
00:17:26,273 --> 00:17:30,323
Remember what the manager disguised as her mother and older sister said.

224
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,473
My daughter forgot her wallet and panicked.

225
00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:38,793
My sister forgot her wallet and panicked.

226
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:42,083
That was probably the truth.

227
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:44,833
If that's true, then...

228
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:46,833
She really did...

229
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:53,093
...forget her wallet and panic?

230
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:59,273
Does that mean Kakurai Kayoko is just an airhead?

231
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,313
It's certainly possible.

232
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:05,103
Air Head

233
00:18:05,643 --> 00:18:07,262
No...

234
00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:09,233
Kakurai Kayoko...

235
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:10,993
An airhead?

236
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,243
My Kakurai Kayoko isn't an airhead!

237
00:18:18,403 --> 00:18:19,932
My Kakurai Kayoko isn't an airhead,

238
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,452
my Kakurai Kayoko isn't an airhead,

239
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:23,393
my Kakurai Kayoko isn't an airhead.

240
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:27,002
I need a drink, too!

241
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:29,503
You're on duty, Officer Yamasato!

242
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:39,153
Officer Yamasato, what's wrong with your Kakurai Kayoko being an airhead?

243
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:43,063
Officer Yamasato, you underestimate idols.

244
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:46,523
I've underestimated idols?

245
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,372
Going forward, idols must be strong.

246
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:52,462
Strong?

247
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:57,782
Perhaps what Ran saw wasn't her practicing her smile,

248
00:18:57,783 --> 00:19:00,663
but practicing how not to smile.

249
00:19:03,223 --> 00:19:06,093
No. No!

250
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:08,672
It's possible.

251
00:19:08,673 --> 00:19:13,303
Kakurai Kayoko is trying to become a new person.

252
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:16,653
A new Kakurai Kayoko...

253
00:19:17,153 --> 00:19:19,303
Your Kakurai Kayoko is strong.

254
00:19:19,863 --> 00:19:23,883
She has the strength to withstand the jealousy of the other DDPP members.

255
00:19:24,353 --> 00:19:29,563
And above all, Kakurai Kayoko has acting skills.

256
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:32,272
Kakurai Kayoko's acting skills?

257
00:19:32,273 --> 00:19:34,573
Yeah, right. That's not possible.

258
00:19:35,103 --> 00:19:37,162
Kakurai Kayoko has a cute smile.

259
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:38,572
That's all she has.

260
00:19:38,573 --> 00:19:40,453
She's more than that.

261
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:45,512
Why did the female manager appear to be her mother at the Beika City family restaurant?

262
00:19:45,513 --> 00:19:48,713
Why did she appear to be her older sister at the Haido City ramen restaurant?

263
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:50,343
Why?

264
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:52,802
Remember what the waitstaff said.

265
00:19:52,803 --> 00:19:56,222
The girl who dine and dashed and the girl accompanied

266
00:19:56,223 --> 00:19:58,403
by her mother seemed like two different people.

267
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:02,473
That was because of Kakurai Kayoko's acting.

268
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,192
She played a daughter at the Beika City family restaurant

269
00:20:05,193 --> 00:20:07,603
and a younger sister at the Haido City ramen restaurant.

270
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:11,493
What is this if not acting skills?

271
00:20:13,023 --> 00:20:17,402
Kakurai Kayoko... is an actress?

272
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:18,333
Yes.

273
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:25,153
Right now, Kakurai Kayoko is attempting to be reborn as a new Kakurai Kayoko.

274
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:37,303
Great Detective Mori Kogoro,

275
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:41,673
you've cracked the case marvelously!

276
00:20:44,663 --> 00:20:46,313
You're on soon.

277
00:20:46,523 --> 00:20:47,593
Okay.

278
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:40,923
Thank you, Great Detective Mori Kogoro.

279
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:42,093
Well, goodbye.

280
00:22:42,593 --> 00:22:47,303
By the way, Officer Yamasato, shouldn't you get back to your duties at the police box?

281
00:22:47,473 --> 00:22:51,183
Oh, my shift ended a long time ago.

282
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,193
Oh, really?

283
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:01,223
He finally left.

284
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:04,383
We're filming.

285
00:23:16,723 --> 00:23:19,023
Now face the sun and shout.

286
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:38,193
Kayoko

287
00:23:46,263 --> 00:23:46,993
Blood?

288
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,432
What are you doing, Ayumi-chan?

289
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:56,173
I'm looking for a four-leaf clover.

290
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:58,213
Impossible.

291
00:24:01,053 --> 00:24:03,803
She covered her eye just now.

292
00:24:05,063 --> 00:24:08,553
Her right eye must be damaged.

293
00:24:09,503 --> 00:24:14,083
The next episode of Conan is "Picking Wild Plants and Clovers, Part One!"
