1
00:00:01,086 --> 00:00:08,896
The message Ran received from Ooka Momiji pit me against Hattori in a code breaking race.

2
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:11,886
However, we solved the code at the same time.

3
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:17,816
Following the decoded message, we headed to a warehouse at Haido Harbor.

4
00:00:31,976 --> 00:00:33,655
Finally arriving after swaying back and forth,

5
00:00:33,656 --> 00:00:35,495
draw close to mysteries and begin deducing the truth!

6
00:00:35,496 --> 00:00:37,245
One of the brothers is the culprit!

7
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:38,855
How will the mystery-solving contest conclude?

8
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:40,545
Always determining the one truth

9
00:00:40,546 --> 00:00:42,315
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

10
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:45,176
his name is Detective Conan!

11
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:21,226
"Ooka Momiji's Challenge, Part Two!"

12
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:27,356
The deceased is Hamana Benzo-san, 42 years old.

13
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:30,295
He worked as a department store buyer.

14
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:31,856
So he fell to his death.

15
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:34,905
Looks like he fell from up there.

16
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:38,735
Yes. We don't know yet if it was an accident or suicide.

17
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:39,906
It was murder.

18
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:40,816
What?

19
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:42,555
Look closely.

20
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:46,726
Those metal-frame glasses are lying crooked on his face.

21
00:02:47,736 --> 00:02:53,665
It doesn't make sense that the right side of his face is uninjured.

22
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,085
You're right.

23
00:02:55,086 --> 00:02:56,796
Wouldn't that mean

24
00:02:57,576 --> 00:03:00,306
the victim's glasses fell off when he fell,

25
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:06,556
and the culprit put them back on the body's head for some reason?

26
00:03:07,116 --> 00:03:10,405
Right, Shinichi-niichan?

27
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:13,436
He's on the phone with Kudo-kun?

28
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:18,885
Apparently those three men were already here when you arrived,

29
00:03:18,886 --> 00:03:20,245
but why did you come here?

30
00:03:20,246 --> 00:03:21,576
Because of the code.

31
00:03:22,156 --> 00:03:24,875
One indicating where the treasure is hidden.

32
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:26,135
The treasure?

33
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:26,826
Yes.

34
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:32,305
Their mother, who worked as a housekeeper at a certain mansion,

35
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:37,086
received a treasure from the master of the house before her death.

36
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:41,455
She expressed the treasure's hiding place in four codes

37
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:43,596
and gave one to each brother.

38
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:48,025
However, after the brothers shared their codes with each other,

39
00:03:48,026 --> 00:03:52,225
they suddenly lost contact with the eldest brother Benzo-san.

40
00:03:52,226 --> 00:03:57,945
Since the Ooka family has a relationship with said master of the house,

41
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,116
he asked us to solve the code, and I asked Heiji-kun and Kudo-kun for help.

42
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,905
When we came here after solving the code,

43
00:04:03,906 --> 00:04:06,116
these three were already here,

44
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:10,746
and that body was lying on the ground at their feet.

45
00:04:10,906 --> 00:04:16,256
All three of them claim they came here because their murdered eldest brother texted them.

46
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:21,496
Normally you'd assume whoever arrived first pushed the eldest brother and killed him.

47
00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:25,235
Who arrived first?

48
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:26,976
Well...

49
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:28,756
It was...

50
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:31,915
It's true that I seem to have arrived first,

51
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:36,605
but our brother was already dead on the floor like that by that point.

52
00:04:36,606 --> 00:04:39,445
Isn't that right?

53
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,915
I don't know about that.

54
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:46,485
All I can say is that this guy was already here by the time I arrived,

55
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,366
and that our brother was dead.

56
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:56,405
S-Since I arrived after these guys, that means I'm not the culprit, right?

57
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:58,266
Not necessarily.

58
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:02,466
After killing the eldest brother Benzo-san,

59
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:05,395
you could've hid in the area

60
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:11,596
and waited for someone to discover the body before popping out.

61
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:17,165
Anyway, you seem rather standoffish for brothers, calling each other "this guy."

62
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,856
Of course we are.

63
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:23,265
We were put up for adoption 30 years ago.

64
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:25,585
We hadn't met since then.

65
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:28,616
We're practically meeting for the first time.

66
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:31,925
Come to think of it, they don't really resemble each other.

67
00:05:31,926 --> 00:05:34,376
Are they really brothers?

68
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:36,235
Hold on.

69
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,815
We've got the photo to prove it.

70
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:39,416
Take a look.

71
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:41,336
See?

72
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,966
All three of them have got the same photo?

73
00:05:44,206 --> 00:05:47,525
But they're such young kids in the photo.

74
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:49,976
It's hard to tell if they look like them.

75
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,515
I don't know what to say to that.

76
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:54,725
This is the only photo we have.

77
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:57,106
And it was 30 years old.

78
00:05:57,606 --> 00:05:59,146
Excuse me, detective.

79
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:03,025
Was there a burn scar on the body's hand?

80
00:06:03,026 --> 00:06:04,506
A burn scar?

81
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:11,366
There's an oddly-shaped burn scar on the body's right palm.

82
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:15,956
If they're really brothers, then they should all have the same burn scar.

83
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:18,836
Could you show us your hands?

84
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:28,256
Could those burn scars have come from...

85
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,886
...a Jingisukan pot?

86
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:32,026
Yeah.

87
00:06:32,027 --> 00:06:33,935
Before we were put up for adoption,

88
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:40,896
we were invited to the mansion where our mother worked and had Jingisukan.

89
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:44,885
I still remember how that lamb tasted.

90
00:06:44,886 --> 00:06:51,036
While we were cleaning up after we finished eating, someone flipped the pot over.

91
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:56,036
Our mother was about to get burnt, so we reflexively stuck out our hands and ended up like this.

92
00:06:56,486 --> 00:06:59,555
We're lucky it wasn't worse.

93
00:06:59,556 --> 00:07:01,835
It was heavy, and our hands were there for a long time.

94
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:06,426
Yeah. On top of that, we cooked a ton of meat that day.

95
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:11,846
That's right. I'm impressed we were able to catch it since it was so hot.

96
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:18,155
Speaking of Jingisukan, apparently there was a Jingisukan pot inside a plastic bag.

97
00:07:18,156 --> 00:07:19,475
Where?

98
00:07:19,476 --> 00:07:23,656
Around that area where we believe the victim was pushed from.

99
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:30,486
What? The order in which I escorted them to Warehouse 4?

100
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:34,995
I remember the bearded man arrived first,

101
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,405
but I don't remember the order in which the other three arrived.

102
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:39,406
I-I see.

103
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:43,075
Can I go now?

104
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:44,675
There are a lot of people here today.

105
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:46,725
I need to keep things organized.

106
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:48,355
Is something happening?

107
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:52,756
Apparently today's the day for great social media posts that happens once a year.

108
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,965
I-It's what?

109
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:55,636
What?

110
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:57,486
Tell me all about it.

111
00:07:58,476 --> 00:08:02,856
Momiji-ojosama, we have a rather serious problem.

112
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,436
Look at this.

113
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:08,235
A lovely spot for great social media posts that happens once a year?

114
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:09,696
Today, here at this harbor?

115
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:11,925
How marvelous.

116
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:14,585
According to the information I gathered,

117
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:19,286
Hattori-sama is waiting for the opportunity to confess his feelings in front of a picturesque view.

118
00:08:19,826 --> 00:08:25,026
If he defeats Kudo-sama in the mystery-solving contest,

119
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:32,046
he may confess his feelings to Kazuha-sama before he realizes how attractive you are.

120
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:34,926
We'll have to do something about that.

121
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:36,821
Kudo-kun must win, no matter what.

122
00:08:36,846 --> 00:08:38,166
It's so hot.

123
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,465
Conan-kun, want some water?

124
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,686
Yeah, thanks.

125
00:08:42,926 --> 00:08:47,435
There's not much we can do if we don't know the order in which the three brothers arrived.

126
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:52,355
Yes. It's not clear why they suddenly lost contact with the victim either.

127
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:58,565
It's because he lost his phone while traveling abroad on a business trip.

128
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:03,465
He wrote in his message that he found it at the airport when he returned to Japan.

129
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:07,895
He was surprised to find a ton of messages from us in his history

130
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:09,285
that we sent while his phone was lost.

131
00:09:09,286 --> 00:09:12,716
I'm not sure exactly why he asked us to meet him here today though.

132
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:17,545
So you often exchange messages with Benzo-san.

133
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:21,726
Yes. Not only that, but we frequently sent each other gifts.

134
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:27,465
The other day, he gave me his favorite watch with a leather band.

135
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,356
Apparently he didn't need it anymore.

136
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:31,895
He gave me a leather jacket.

137
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:39,366
But I was surprised when he returned my gift of chocolate and nuts he liked as a kid.

138
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,565
The same thing happened to me.

139
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:46,065
Since he used to like crab, I sent him canned crab,

140
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:48,376
but for some reason he returned all of them.

141
00:09:48,826 --> 00:09:49,526
Huh?

142
00:09:50,086 --> 00:09:52,295
Something just caught my attention.

143
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:53,286
What was it?

144
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:55,155
Hey, Conan-kun.

145
00:09:55,156 --> 00:09:55,796
Huh?

146
00:09:56,366 --> 00:10:00,515
Are you keeping Kudo-kun updated on the situation?

147
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,556
Y-Yeah.

148
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:05,735
If you'd like, Iori would be willing to discuss things with you.

149
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:06,945
What do you think?

150
00:10:06,946 --> 00:10:08,606
I-I'm fine.

151
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:11,115
That's what Shinichi-niichan said.

152
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:13,736
Momiji's helping Kudo-kun.

153
00:10:14,456 --> 00:10:16,476
Heiji, you can do it!

154
00:10:16,926 --> 00:10:18,085
Heck yeah.

155
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:24,075
If I beat Kudo, I'll ride that momentum to the lovely spot

156
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:26,966
and confess my feelings to Kazuha!

157
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:28,815
What's going on?

158
00:10:28,816 --> 00:10:31,756
I'm only getting a bad feeling from him.

159
00:10:32,086 --> 00:10:37,945
Speaking of crab, he sends me crab-flavored crackers all the time.

160
00:10:37,946 --> 00:10:39,675
Says he recommends them.

161
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:42,676
Then it's not as though he doesn't like crab anymore.

162
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:44,276
Crackers...

163
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:47,065
What's wrong, Genta-kun?

164
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:48,265
Are you itchy?

165
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:51,686
I suddenly started feeling itchy after eating these crackers.

166
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:55,895
Kojima-kun, you might be allergic to shellfish.

167
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:58,046
You shouldn't eat any more of those crackers.

168
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:03,576
I see. So that's how it is.

169
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:07,076
That's why the culprit was forced to do that.

170
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:10,586
Looks like Hattori hasn't solved it yet.

171
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:14,586
Ran seems to be rooting for me, too.

172
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:16,886
Huh? Wait a minute.

173
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:21,606
Isn't that face...?

174
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:33,015
These donuts are good.

175
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:34,016
Yeah.

176
00:11:37,836 --> 00:11:39,865
It's okay. You can have it, Shinichi.

177
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,986
Okay, thanks.

178
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:47,555
Actually, you can have it, Ran.

179
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:49,166
I'm full anyway.

180
00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:51,886
Really? Thanks.

181
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:56,546
She's making the same face she did back then.

182
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,135
Which means what she really wants is...

183
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,816
Hey, Conan-kun.

184
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:07,445
Didn't Kudo-kun just explain the truth behind the case to you over the phone?

185
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:08,306
What?

186
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:12,935
Iori says your expression changed.

187
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:16,566
No, it wasn't about that.

188
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:20,895
He said he noticed something about the victim Benzo-san.

189
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:25,256
Benzo-san probably developed a crab allergy.

190
00:12:26,356 --> 00:12:32,875
Benzo-san used to like crab, but he returned the gift of canned crab, right?

191
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:35,256
Then what about my chocolate and nuts?

192
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:37,805
Maybe it's a snack allergy or something.

193
00:12:37,806 --> 00:12:41,036
What? I've never heard of that allergy.

194
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:43,676
He's allergic to metal.

195
00:12:44,106 --> 00:12:44,926
What?

196
00:12:45,446 --> 00:12:49,605
Canned goods absorb metal from their cans.

197
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:54,936
Chocolate and nuts contain metals such as nickel and cobalt.

198
00:12:55,276 --> 00:13:02,406
And fluid chrome is applied to leather products to make them more flexible.

199
00:13:02,576 --> 00:13:03,725
I see.

200
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:06,156
But why does that matter?

201
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:07,915
Don't you think it's strange?

202
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:13,265
There were metal-frame glasses on Benzo-san's head.

203
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:18,046
You're right. If he were allergic to metal, he'd avoid wearing those, so why?

204
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,756
Those were the culprit's glasses.

205
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:25,636
Benzo-san grabbed the culprit's glasses when he was pushed.

206
00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:29,886
They broke when they fell.

207
00:13:30,116 --> 00:13:34,435
The culprit was forced to wear Benzo-san's glasses.

208
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:37,976
After all, the brothers he invited there would be arriving soon.

209
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:42,205
In other words, the culprit who made Benzo-san fall to his death

210
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:45,366
is the only one of the suspects wearing glasses.

211
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:47,236
Jinya Saisuke-san.

212
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:49,985
You're the only one.

213
00:13:49,986 --> 00:13:54,135
Wh-Why would I kill my brother?

214
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:56,746
We were finally reunited after 30 years!

215
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:59,006
And remember what I showed you earlier?

216
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:04,926
This burn I suffered while protecting our mom as a child proves we're brothers!

217
00:14:05,256 --> 00:14:11,686
You said someone flipped over the Jingisukan pot while you were cleaning up, right?

218
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,985
Yeah.

219
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,975
The pot was about to burn our mom,

220
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:20,825
so we reached out to catch the piping hot pot.

221
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:21,696
What?

222
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:25,215
No, that's wrong.

223
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:28,835
It was actually the pot that had fallen on the floor.

224
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:32,605
Your mom was about to fall onto it,

225
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:36,785
so you slid your hands between her and the pot to protect her.

226
00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:37,836
Isn't that right?

227
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:39,046
Yeah.

228
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:41,395
That's how we got these burns.

229
00:14:41,396 --> 00:14:45,125
Our hands were pressed against the pot until she got up.

230
00:14:45,126 --> 00:14:47,506
What? But you said it was heavy.

231
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:50,105
I was referring to mom's weight.

232
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:52,516
She was pretty fat back then.

233
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:57,075
Oh, right. I remembered it wrong.

234
00:14:57,076 --> 00:15:00,976
But as you can see, I've got a burn scar, too.

235
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:05,525
I'm sorry. I spilled my water.

236
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:06,615
Jeez.

237
00:15:06,616 --> 00:15:07,906
Huh?

238
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:11,165
I thought it was water, but it was actually lemon juice!

239
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,915
What? Hey, wait!

240
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,076
I need to wipe that off quickly!

241
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:17,826
Since you're panicking, you must've made that burn scar

242
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:23,466
by applying citrus juice to your skin and exposing it to sunlight.

243
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:26,466
Oh, it was actually water after all.

244
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:27,836
What?

245
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:32,545
You thought you'd use the photosynthetic chemicals

246
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:37,846
in fruit juice react to UV light and cause phytophotodermatitis.

247
00:15:38,486 --> 00:15:43,796
And besides, your large unattached earlobes tell us you're not one of the brothers.

248
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:44,936
What?

249
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:47,286
Those earlobes are a dominant gene.

250
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:51,336
People are rarely born with them unless one of their parents have them.

251
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:57,335
You probably talked to the real brother and decided to use what you learned.

252
00:15:57,336 --> 00:16:00,766
You thought you'd get some of the treasure by pretending to be him.

253
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:02,336
Yeah.

254
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:06,215
I gave myself this burn scar because I thought it was cool

255
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,816
when I met Saisuke and copied him.

256
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:13,186
We were both in edgy bands during college.

257
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:18,655
You didn't hurt Saisuke because you wanted the treasure, did you?

258
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:20,856
I didn't do anything like that!

259
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:26,195
Saisuke died of an illness just the other day.

260
00:16:26,196 --> 00:16:31,866
Before he died, he told me about the code and your mom's treasure.

261
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,975
He said he wanted to see his brothers again,

262
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:37,746
but doubted you'd remember him.

263
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:41,505
While I was organizing his possessions after his death,

264
00:16:41,506 --> 00:16:44,846
his phone received a message from Benzo-san.

265
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:49,075
It said, "The treasure is in Haido Harbor Warehouse 4."

266
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:52,926
"I'll be waiting there. Let me know if you can come."

267
00:16:53,716 --> 00:16:58,545
Our faces were similar, and I had this burn scar, too.

268
00:16:58,546 --> 00:17:03,896
I thought I'd get a share of the treasure if I pretended to be him, so I showed up.

269
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:08,146
See? We got these when we caught the pot.

270
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:11,845
Who are you?

271
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:14,026
You're not my brother Saisuke.

272
00:17:14,236 --> 00:17:14,896
What?

273
00:17:14,897 --> 00:17:16,495
What did you do with Saisuke?

274
00:17:16,496 --> 00:17:18,005
Uh, I...

275
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:20,536
Hold on. I'm calling the cops.

276
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,625
The police?

277
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:28,086
My brothers will show up later. We're going to lay into you, you con artist!

278
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:31,085
N-No, wait! I can explain!

279
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:32,796
What are you doing? Let go!

280
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:43,385
So I didn't meant to kill him!

281
00:17:43,386 --> 00:17:49,066
I just thought it'd be nice if I got a little bit of the treasure...

282
00:17:49,346 --> 00:17:52,446
There's no splitting that treasure.

283
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:57,946
Wh-What? But I heard she received it from a wealthy man.

284
00:17:58,206 --> 00:17:59,176
Yeah.

285
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:04,765
It's the memento that gave the brothers their honorable injury

286
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:06,635
when they protected their mother.

287
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:12,056
The Jingisukan pot Benzo-san was holding before he fell.

288
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:13,716
What?

289
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:18,035
Your mom probably intended for you to remember

290
00:18:18,036 --> 00:18:21,975
how close you were as a family 30 years ago

291
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:25,266
if you ate Jingisukan from that pot again as brothers.

292
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:29,235
Then the reason our brother invited us here...

293
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:32,236
...was so we could eat Jingisukan together.

294
00:18:32,496 --> 00:18:38,266
Not realizing that, you ended up burning yourself out of greed,

295
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:42,166
with the serious burn of murder.

296
00:18:46,106 --> 00:18:47,246
Heiji...

297
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:48,996
He's so cool.

298
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:52,506
I knew my future husband could do it.

299
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:56,256
In that case, Iori, as per our arrangements...

300
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,256
Yes, Momiji-ojosama.

301
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:03,516
All right. I've still got time.

302
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:05,305
Kazuha, this way!

303
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:06,146
What?

304
00:19:06,496 --> 00:19:08,516
Hey, wait! Heiji?

305
00:20:33,726 --> 00:20:36,605
Hey, Heiji! Where are we going?

306
00:20:36,606 --> 00:20:38,186
Heiji!

307
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:49,666
Wow, what a pretty sunset.

308
00:20:50,436 --> 00:20:51,416
You dummy.

309
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:55,416
Look closely at the two passenger ships in front of the setting sun.

310
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:59,945
The white ship in front and the ship with the red chimney behind it

311
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:03,905
are only both at this harbor once a year.

312
00:21:03,906 --> 00:21:10,436
In other words, today's the only day those ships line up to form a heart.

313
00:21:10,756 --> 00:21:13,846
Which makes today a heart's day to remember.

314
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:20,146
Kazuha, I'm about to spill my heart to you, so listen closely.

315
00:21:20,686 --> 00:21:21,656
K-Kazuha?

316
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:24,435
Wh-Where did you go, Kazuha?

317
00:21:24,436 --> 00:21:25,606
Hattori.

318
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:27,406
K-Kudo?

319
00:21:27,716 --> 00:21:33,416
Kazuha-chan just headed down the stairs after that Iori guy whispered something in her ear.

320
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,585
What are you doing here?

321
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:41,676
I came to let you know since it seemed like you hadn't noticed.

322
00:21:41,856 --> 00:21:44,436
What? Jeez.

323
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,086
There she is. Over there.

324
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:50,686
Lovely!

325
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:56,226
Let's take another picture.

326
00:21:57,116 --> 00:22:01,545
Iori said he'd invite Heiji, but he's not here.

327
00:22:01,546 --> 00:22:06,236
I doubt boys are interested in lovely spots.

328
00:22:07,446 --> 00:22:11,246
What's Kazuha doing? I was going to...

329
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:12,866
"Heart's day to remember."

330
00:22:13,106 --> 00:22:16,706
I-I-I-It's not what it sounds like! I was just caught up in the moment!

331
00:22:17,286 --> 00:22:20,915
Yeah, it was a joke! Pretty funny joke, right?

332
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,376
What a pain in the ass.

333
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:27,605
Well, whatever. Seems like you let me have all the glory this time.

334
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:31,585
Yeah, I owed you for the school trip.

335
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:34,896
Anyway, I don't understand women.

336
00:22:35,276 --> 00:22:38,335
The less we understand something...

337
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,826
The more detectives want to solve it.

338
00:22:42,356 --> 00:22:43,446
Yup.

339
00:22:46,046 --> 00:22:53,805
Anyway, I wonder whose mansion their mother was working at.

340
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:58,155
Iori the butler told me.

341
00:22:58,156 --> 00:23:01,255
It's the mansion of a famous guy you're quite familiar with.

342
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,546
A famous guy?

343
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:04,865
The hextuple crown shogi player.

344
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:08,296
It's the home of Haneda Shukichi's family.

345
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:09,316
What?

346
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:13,376
Apparently the rest of the world doesn't know about it yet.

347
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,976
I-I see.

348
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:21,846
Isn't Haneda Akai-san's younger brother and Sera's older brother?

349
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:27,065
17 years ago, his brother-in-law Haneda Koji

350
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:34,036
was force fed APTX 4869 by someone in America.

351
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:39,146
In other words, the quadruple crown shogi player Haneda Koji

352
00:23:39,616 --> 00:23:42,776
was the son of a wealthy family.

353
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:48,546
It's like, where are all the hot guys?

354
00:23:53,596 --> 00:23:57,016
Hikaru-san, I'd like to talk to you about something.

355
00:24:03,116 --> 00:24:04,436
What is this?

356
00:24:05,296 --> 00:24:06,566
What's going on?

357
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:08,256
We were too late.

358
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:13,116
The next episode of Conan is "The Unspeakable Witness!"
