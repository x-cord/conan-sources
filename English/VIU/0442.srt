1
00:00:01,828 --> 00:00:03,227
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03,228 --> 00:00:05,127
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05,128 --> 00:00:06,427
A falling object changes a person's life.

4
00:00:06,428 --> 00:00:07,827
Differences in thought causes an incident,

5
00:00:07,828 --> 00:00:09,527
the Youth Detective Squad, put a stop to it!

6
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:10,827
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,828 --> 00:00:12,427
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:14,528
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:56,422
"Beika Station."

10
00:02:02,614 --> 00:02:04,914
What a huge eel over rice.

11
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:09,413
Genta, you're not getting anywhere staring at it like that forever.

12
00:02:09,414 --> 00:02:11,814
I'd sure like to taste it.

13
00:02:12,914 --> 00:02:14,214
Look out!

14
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:20,414
Are you all right?

15
00:02:22,214 --> 00:02:23,813
Did he get hit?

16
00:02:23,814 --> 00:02:25,313
I'm sure he dodged it in time.

17
00:02:25,314 --> 00:02:27,713
I think he just passed out.

18
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,313
-Mitsuhiko! -Yes, an ambulance, right?

19
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:33,014
"Watanabe Central Hospital."

20
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:37,213
How was it, Officer Takagi?

21
00:02:37,214 --> 00:02:40,413
It seems to have simple mistake in operating the crane.

22
00:02:40,414 --> 00:02:42,713
Which means that it was an accident and not a case?

23
00:02:42,714 --> 00:02:46,213
Yes. Besides, I just asked the nurse station

24
00:02:46,214 --> 00:02:49,113
and was told that although he broke a foot from the fall,

25
00:02:49,114 --> 00:02:51,713
there were no abnormalities found in his head or brain.

26
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:53,413
Only, since he's still passed out,

27
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:57,113
they cannot identify who or where he's from.

28
00:02:57,114 --> 00:02:58,213
Oh, I just remembered!

29
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:00,413
This is his belongings!

30
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,914
Something that may help identify him may be in his belongings.

31
00:03:10,214 --> 00:03:12,213
What's this rope for?

32
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:13,714
This is...

33
00:03:16,214 --> 00:03:17,414
A rope.

34
00:03:18,714 --> 00:03:19,914
Working gloves.

35
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:22,614
A wallet.

36
00:03:23,614 --> 00:03:24,814
An envelope?

37
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:29,613
"I'm tired of going on living, already."

38
00:03:29,614 --> 00:03:31,313
-Could this be... -A will.

39
00:03:31,314 --> 00:03:32,413
Then, that man...

40
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:35,813
Tried to commit suicide using a rope.

41
00:03:35,814 --> 00:03:39,013
Daijirou Manaka, 27 years old.

42
00:03:39,014 --> 00:03:42,513
He's only in his 20's, but he says that he's tired of living,

43
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,513
like he's an aged person already!

44
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:46,113
True.

45
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:47,114
Besides...

46
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:50,014
What on earth is this?

47
00:03:52,214 --> 00:03:58,114
"Man Hindered by a Steel-Frame."

48
00:04:01,614 --> 00:04:04,713
You've finally awaken, Mr. Manaka.

49
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:05,814
I'm from the police.

50
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,514
What on earth is this?

51
00:04:11,314 --> 00:04:14,014
Please explain what's going on.

52
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,314
Mr. Manaka!

53
00:04:17,614 --> 00:04:20,713
Manaka? Is that my name?

54
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:22,014
Yes?

55
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:28,214
No good, I don't remember anything!

56
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,013
Poor thing, not even knowing who he actually is.

57
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,613
Okay, I'll try shock treatment on him!

58
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:40,313
No, Genta!

59
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,813
Why're you stopping me?

60
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,413
He's forgotten everything for now, but what if his memory returns

61
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:47,313
and he decides to commit suicide again?

62
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:50,014
Oh, I see.

63
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:53,313
In other words, I've got to keep my eyes on him

64
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:56,013
to keep him from danger

65
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:59,313
because there's no way of knowing when his memory will return.

66
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:01,013
We want to help him get back his memory,

67
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:04,113
but how we do if he may commit suicide?

68
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:05,713
What can we do?

69
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:08,313
Let's solve the problem with our own hands

70
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:10,113
before his memory comes back!

71
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:11,913
What's the problem?

72
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:15,613
He must've had a problem that made him want to commit suicide.

73
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,813
So, all we have to do is solve that for him.

74
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:19,813
Then he won't think of committing suicide again!

75
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:22,813
Okay, off goes the Youth Detective Squad!

76
00:05:22,814 --> 00:05:24,013
Yeah!

77
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:25,913
That man...

78
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:28,113
What's up, Conan?

79
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:30,713
I wonder if he's really got amnesia.

80
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:32,213
Are you saying that he's lying?

81
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:33,613
He's lying?

82
00:05:33,614 --> 00:05:37,513
When a person lies, it inadvertently shows on the person's face.

83
00:05:37,514 --> 00:05:40,414
They blink a lot, or their eye wander.

84
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:44,313
That man's eyes were wandering.

85
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:46,013
That's because of his anxiety.

86
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:48,313
I mean after all, he couldn't remember his own name.

87
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:52,713
Why would he have to fake having amnesia in the first place?

88
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:54,413
Beats me.

89
00:05:54,414 --> 00:05:56,913
I don't think it's good to suspect him for something you have no idea of.

90
00:05:56,914 --> 00:06:00,413
But, something bothers me about him.

91
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:03,113
Come to think of it, even about that matter.

92
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:04,313
What matter?

93
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:08,013
Back then, he was heading South on Beika-cho, right?

94
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:10,313
The only thing that's there is a residential district.

95
00:06:10,314 --> 00:06:12,613
If he were contemplating suicide, wouldn't he go the other way,

96
00:06:12,614 --> 00:06:16,013
towards the mountains or some place where there are not too many people?

97
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:19,014
There are places with no people in residential areas too.

98
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:21,013
Could be but...

99
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,014
That's fine!

100
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:24,413
It seems like Conan doesn't want to cooperate,

101
00:06:24,414 --> 00:06:25,513
so let's do it on our own.

102
00:06:25,514 --> 00:06:29,113
First, let's find out what kind of problem Mr. Manaka had.

103
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:30,114
-Okay! -Yeah!

104
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:32,513
We've got to stop him committing suicide, no matter what.

105
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:34,613
Yeah, prevent his suicide! Prevent his suicide!

106
00:06:34,614 --> 00:06:36,314
Hey, I'm going too!

107
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:40,213
Is Mr. Manaka an artist?

108
00:06:40,214 --> 00:06:43,713
He's not famous at all though.

109
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:46,113
But, it's a pretty drawing.

110
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,013
They're all simple and nice drawings.

111
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:50,613
He's a very serious person,

112
00:06:50,614 --> 00:06:53,513
who takes about six months to finish one drawing.

113
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:56,613
That's why he ends up not being able to pay his rent.

114
00:06:56,614 --> 00:06:58,513
Did he have problems with money?

115
00:06:58,514 --> 00:07:01,013
Mr. Daijirou Manaka.

116
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:03,113
Give us back what you owe us today!

117
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:05,613
Interest and all, the total is 2 million yen!

118
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:07,513
Mr. Manaka's not in.

119
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:10,913
Shoots! We're coming back again later.

120
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:13,013
If Mr. Manaka were to have any problems,

121
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:14,913
debts are all I can think of.

122
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:18,313
After all, those two come everyday and bug him to pay them back.

123
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:20,613
If money is what his problem is,

124
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:23,813
the Youth Detective Squad can't do anything about it.

125
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:26,313
But, we can't give up just like that!

126
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:30,613
Isn't there anyone who'll lend Mr. Manaka money?

127
00:07:30,614 --> 00:07:34,213
He has no family, he does have an uncle.

128
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:35,513
But no matter how many times he went and asked for help,

129
00:07:35,514 --> 00:07:38,013
it seems his uncle didn't lend him even a cent.

130
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:40,413
Is his uncle also poor?

131
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:42,213
His uncle is filthy rich!

132
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:46,113
He's called Mr. Ginbayashi, and owns a big mansion in Beika South.

133
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:48,113
Beika South?

134
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:49,613
Oh yeah, there's a really big mansion

135
00:07:49,614 --> 00:07:52,213
with the name plate Ginbayashi on it!

136
00:07:52,214 --> 00:07:55,013
He's a lone man with no family too,

137
00:07:55,014 --> 00:08:00,913
so I don't see why he isn't a bit nicer to his only blood-related nephew?

138
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,913
Only blood related nephew.

139
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:05,713
I see, so that's the story!

140
00:08:05,714 --> 00:08:08,014
What's up, Mitsuhiko?

141
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:17,013
I got it!

142
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:19,313
Have you figured out a way to solve Mr. Manaka's money problem?

143
00:08:19,314 --> 00:08:22,713
-Not yet. -Then what did you figure out?

144
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:26,613
The reason Mr. Manaka was walking where he was.

145
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:28,313
You figured it out, Mitsuhiko?

146
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:33,713
Mr. Manaka was on his way to his uncle's house in Beika South!

147
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,313
That's most likely.

148
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:39,313
His purpose was to commit suicide at his uncle's house

149
00:08:39,314 --> 00:08:41,013
to get back at him...

150
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:42,514
"Ginbayashi"

151
00:08:47,114 --> 00:08:50,614
for not lending him money no matter how many times he asked.

152
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,114
I see!

153
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:57,414
Unfortunately, Mitsuhiko, that doesn't explain anything.

154
00:08:58,214 --> 00:08:59,914
The truth is probably...

155
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:02,213
What's up, Conan?

156
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:03,914
Not again! Hey!

157
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:11,513
I thought you all went home.

158
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:13,614
No, this bugged me after all.

159
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:18,413
Does your foot hurt?

160
00:09:18,414 --> 00:09:21,413
The anesthesia's wearing off, so yeah...

161
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:24,613
But, I'm glad, that all you broke is the bone of your leg.

162
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:27,913
If it were your hands, you wouldn't be able to draw.

163
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:29,313
True.

164
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:32,313
He knows that he's an artist.

165
00:09:32,314 --> 00:09:34,413
He's lying about having lost his memory after all.

166
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:37,713
He didn't want to give himself away being questioned by Officer Takagi

167
00:09:37,714 --> 00:09:41,014
so he decided on the spot to feign having lost his memory.

168
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:48,413
About him heading over to his uncle's place back then

169
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:51,513
is probably just as Mitsuhiko deduced.

170
00:09:51,514 --> 00:09:54,113
But, it wasn't to commit suicide.

171
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:57,513
But rather, to make it look like suicide and kill Ginbayashi.

172
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:01,413
Those gloves were to not leave his fingerprints behind.

173
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:04,913
The contents of the will make sense, if this was the case.

174
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:07,413
"I'm tired of going on living, already."

175
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:10,313
That's what an aged person would say!

176
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:13,313
If Mr. Ginbayashi dies, the entire estate

177
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:16,013
will fall into the hands of his only blood-related nephew, Mr. Manaka.

178
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:18,013
That was probably what he was after.

179
00:10:18,014 --> 00:10:21,913
The problem is, how can I prove this attempted scheme?

180
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,313
What can I do?

181
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:25,013
Conan!

182
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:28,314
We were looking for you because you suddenly disappeared.

183
00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:30,413
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

184
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:31,414
Yes?

185
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:34,513
Let's say there's a murder scheme here.

186
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:37,513
It's a crime that involves a person's life.

187
00:10:37,514 --> 00:10:41,413
But, nothing's happened yet, it's going to happen in the future,

188
00:10:41,414 --> 00:10:43,014
so there's no proof yet.

189
00:10:43,714 --> 00:10:46,214
How would you corner such a culprit?

190
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,214
There's no need to corner the culprit!

191
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:55,814
If it hasn't happened yet, then you prevent it from happening!

192
00:10:57,714 --> 00:10:59,314
Exactly.

193
00:11:00,014 --> 00:11:01,613
There you are, Conan!

194
00:11:01,614 --> 00:11:03,313
We looked all over for you!

195
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:07,714
Let's go to his uncle Mr. Ginbayashi's place and ask him to help out.

196
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:10,913
If he helps out with the debts,

197
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:13,113
Mr. Manaka won't have to think of doing something

198
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:15,214
as stupid as he did anymore, would he?

199
00:11:16,114 --> 00:11:17,813
You mean when you said involving someone's life,

200
00:11:17,814 --> 00:11:20,013
you were referring to suicide?

201
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:21,714
Just what are you talking about?

202
00:11:24,614 --> 00:11:27,914
All I'm saying is let's stop a crime before it even happens!

203
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:37,448
Daijirou tried to commit suicide?

204
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:41,340
He happens to have amnesia right now.

205
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:43,740
But, if his memory comes back, he may again think of...

206
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:45,540
His problem involves debts.

207
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,040
So long as you dish the cash out for him...

208
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,840
-I have no intention of helping him out. -President.

209
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:53,140
You can still save him now.

210
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:55,340
I don't know if I should be telling you children this,

211
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:59,240
but after graduating from university, Daijirou worked for a bank.

212
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:01,240
I was happy.

213
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:03,240
Especially because I was thinking of having him succeed my company

214
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:05,240
when the time came.

215
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:07,940
But, he quit the bank in six months.

216
00:12:07,941 --> 00:12:10,940
Just to follow an old dream to become an artist.

217
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:13,640
He's a selfish guy who trampled all over me.

218
00:12:13,641 --> 00:12:15,040
Why do I have to go out of my way to help a guy like that?

219
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,640
But...

220
00:12:16,641 --> 00:12:19,640
The last he came here was last month.

221
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:21,940
He asked me to lend him money.

222
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,840
A grown man begging on his hands a knees?

223
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:25,741
How wretched can you get?

224
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:31,140
Swear that you'll quit being an artist.

225
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:34,441
I'll lend you as much as you want if you do.

226
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:37,641
Never mind already!

227
00:12:37,642 --> 00:12:40,240
I'm not asking a snob like you for anything anymore!

228
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:44,040
Well said. Don't you ever show your face again!

229
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:48,041
I told him that I'd help him but he refused, that idiot.

230
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:54,240
Money may not be his only purpose.

231
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,840
Maybe Mr. Manaka thought of killing him

232
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:59,540
because of a grudge against him for not understanding his feelings.

233
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,840
It's time for me to go to work.

234
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:03,540
Get ready, will you, Hinuma?

235
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,740
But, president...

236
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:06,940
He clung to his dream.

237
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:09,840
If so, he can starve to death or commit suicide.

238
00:13:09,841 --> 00:13:11,941
He's free to do what he pleases!

239
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:15,740
Mr. Ginbayashi!

240
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:17,941
His eyes were wandering too.

241
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,040
What a cruel uncle.

242
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,240
-Conan! -Conan!

243
00:13:26,241 --> 00:13:28,040
No use, there's nothing more we can do!

244
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,240
I can't let anything like this happen!

245
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:32,541
"Ginbayashi Corporation."

246
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:46,940
Are you sure you don't have to go see Daijirou at the hospital?

247
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:49,740
Just let that guy be!

248
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:52,240
I know that's not how you truly feel.

249
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:53,940
He wasn't being truthful after all.

250
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:55,140
You couldn't let him be,

251
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:58,441
that's why each time there's an exhibition...

252
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:08,341
You secretly send me there to buy his drawings.

253
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:10,741
Shut up!

254
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:19,540
Stop pestering me. I'm not dishing out any cash!

255
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:23,240
You were secretly buying his drawings for him up to now too, weren't you?

256
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:24,440
You eavesdropped?

257
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:25,940
But, if you do it in secret,

258
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:30,540
Mr. Manaka won't know that you are rooting for him, right?

259
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,540
And because he doesn't know,

260
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:36,441
so I think that Mr. Manaka hates you a whole lot.

261
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:38,840
I think so too.

262
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:40,840
It's about time you tell Daijirou how you really feel.

263
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:42,840
Don't get me wrong, Hinuma!

264
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:46,140
I didn't ask you to go buy his drawings because I support his activity.

265
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:47,841
I did so to burn his drawings!

266
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:51,040
Where are the drawings I asked you to go buy, then?

267
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,140
There are none of them here or at the mansion.

268
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:54,640
Of course there aren't.

269
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:59,040
I burnt them to ashes to spite him for trampling all over me.

270
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,640
No way.

271
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:03,540
It's because you're blood related to him after all, right?

272
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,840
Just what do you mean?

273
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:07,840
You're both so much alike.

274
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:10,640
Your eyes, both yours and Mr. Manaka's wander when you lie.

275
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:13,040
You brat. I'm kicking you out of here!

276
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,440
Give me a hand, Hinuma!

277
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:18,040
No, because I want to know why you're lying too, president!

278
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,240
What lie are you talking about?

279
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:21,641
Hold it, you cheeky brat!

280
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,140
You brat! Just what do you think you're doing?

281
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:25,641
I'm sorry!

282
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:34,841
Even if you lie, there's bound to be some kind of evidence.

283
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:37,740
I've found the evidence!

284
00:15:37,741 --> 00:15:38,940
No way.

285
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:41,940
Hey, sir, please go see Mr. Manaka,

286
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,840
and tell him that you've been backing him up all this time!

287
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:47,440
If you don't,

288
00:15:47,441 --> 00:15:49,940
this case will never come to an end!

289
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:52,041
"Watanabe Central Hospital."

290
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:07,940
It seems that they think for now that I was trying to commit suicide,

291
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:09,940
but I'm sure they'll eventually find out the truth.

292
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:12,640
No use feigning that you have amnesia any longer.

293
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:17,040
You were scheming to kill your uncle Mr. Daizo Ginbayashi.

294
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,241
You're under arrest!

295
00:16:19,141 --> 00:16:20,741
This is the end for you!

296
00:16:23,141 --> 00:16:25,241
I can't leave things as is!

297
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:36,940
I see, you tried to solve the problem for him.

298
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:40,040
But, it turned out that there was nothing we could do.

299
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,740
Okay. Now, it's my turn.

300
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:44,740
I'll convince him after he gets his memory back.

301
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:46,640
"No matter how bad of a financial problem you have,"

302
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:49,441
"you can't ever think of suicide," I'll say.

303
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:55,841
They're the collectors!

304
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,140
He's lying about having lost his memory.

305
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:00,640
Don't think you can get away with something like this?

306
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:01,841
Stop!

307
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:05,441
Officer Takagi!

308
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:08,640
He heard us and fled!

309
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:09,841
Don't let him get away!

310
00:17:15,341 --> 00:17:16,641
He's gone.

311
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,140
From here?

312
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:22,340
He couldn't have! He's got a broken leg, you know!

313
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,240
But where else did he...

314
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:27,641
He has amnesia, but he recognized the debt collector's voice?

315
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:31,040
It's reverse! He heard the voice of the collectors, he was shocked

316
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,540
and his memory returned!

317
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,540
So, shock treatment did it after all!

318
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,240
His memory returned, which means...

319
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:39,041
He may be thinking of committing suicide?

320
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:02,241
Mr. Manaka disappeared?

321
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,641
We're looking for him but...

322
00:18:05,441 --> 00:18:07,340
Nobody on that side saw him!

323
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:08,440
Same here.

324
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:11,540
Which means he could still be in the hospital?

325
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,840
Anyway, Conan, come over here too!

326
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:14,841
Okay.

327
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:17,440
He regained his memory

328
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:21,940
so unless we hurry, maybe this time for sure he'll commit suicide.

329
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:25,241
To be honest, you're worried about him, aren't you, Mr. Ginbayashi?

330
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:28,541
Hinuma, get the car!

331
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:33,040
He's not here.

332
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,041
There he is!

333
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:43,241
He stopped.

334
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:45,240
Don't tell me he's going to jump in?

335
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:46,641
We've gotta hurry!

336
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,240
I can't walk any farther

337
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:53,340
because I haven't eaten anything from yesterday so I'm starved.

338
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,541
I was striving to be an artist too.

339
00:18:57,341 --> 00:19:01,140
But, I couldn't make a living so I got rid of that dream.

340
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,040
So, that's the story.

341
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,240
Then, you more than anyone else should be able to understand

342
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:07,140
the difficulty that Daijirou is going through.

343
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:10,040
I'd figure you'd help him from your side.

344
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,340
Just the opposite.

345
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:13,740
Yeah, because he understands,

346
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:17,840
he more so deliberately gave Mr. Manaka the cold shoulder.

347
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:19,841
Don't die, Daijirou.

348
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,440
Don't take rash action!

349
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:23,840
Don't die!

350
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:25,640
Don't ever think of committing suicide!

351
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:27,440
Your memory returned, right?

352
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:29,840
I'll hear you out, tell me about it!

353
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:32,141
If you hear me out, I'll give myself away.

354
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:35,741
Don't come! I'm going to jump if you do!

355
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:39,340
We've finally found you!

356
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:40,640
Return our 2 million yen!

357
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:42,540
Stay away! All of you stay away!

358
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,940
If you come, I'll jump, I mean it!

359
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:47,741
I'll kill myself! I'll really kill myself!

360
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:54,740
Shouting repeatedly that you'll kill yourself. How wretched can you get?

361
00:19:54,741 --> 00:19:56,040
What brings you here?

362
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,540
When you came to tell me you wanted to become an artist,

363
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,540
I was against it!

364
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,740
I told you that you can't make a living as an artist.

365
00:20:02,741 --> 00:20:06,740
But you wouldn't listen to me. You decided to pursue your dream.

366
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:08,040
You idiot!

367
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,740
A snob like you would never understand how I feel!

368
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:15,140
Just as I thought, you came to me for help.

369
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:17,140
But, Daijirou,

370
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:19,240
asking for help as soon as you fall into a rut

371
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:20,840
with such a dependent attitude,

372
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:23,241
you would never be able to realize your dream!

373
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,740
That's why I went out of my way not to pamper you.

374
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:31,040
I refused to help you no matter how much you asked for help.

375
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,940
Stop talking to suit yourself!

376
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:35,840
But, you couldn't help not helping him,

377
00:20:35,841 --> 00:20:38,141
so you were backing him up secretly, right?

378
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:42,340
He was buying your paintings.

379
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,440
My paintings?

380
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:46,040
He was buying your paintings and sending them to elementary schools.

381
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,141
See.

382
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:54,340
That's the elementary school I graduated from.

383
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:57,340
This seems to be a thank you letter from the students there.

384
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,540
"Thank you for all the beautiful paintings!"

385
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:04,040
Beautiful drawings will always make the hearts of children richer.

386
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,641
I believed so, and kept on sending the drawings to them.

387
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:09,140
You bought my pictures.

388
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:12,240
You were constantly helping me behind the scenes.

389
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:14,440
Why didn't you tell me?

390
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,040
I didn't help you!

391
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,840
I bought them because they were good drawings.

392
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:20,941
They just so happened to be what you drew!

393
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:23,640
He's going out of his way to look like a snob.

394
00:21:23,641 --> 00:21:26,040
He turned out to be a nice man that is really thinking about his nephew.

395
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,041
Yeah!

396
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:29,441
His eyes are wandering again.

397
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,840
2 million yen, was it?

398
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:35,140
Thanks.

399
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:37,040
I'm not helping him!

400
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,940
I'm paying in advance

401
00:21:38,941 --> 00:21:42,140
for the next drawing that the children are looking forward to!

402
00:21:42,141 --> 00:21:43,740
Uncle.

403
00:21:43,741 --> 00:21:46,040
I'm sorry. I was actually...

404
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,340
You need not say anything anymore.

405
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:51,141
Just don't ever think of committing suicide ever again!

406
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,840
I'm sorry.

407
00:21:57,841 --> 00:21:59,541
I'm sorry, uncle!

408
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:04,540
It seems he didn't commit a crime

409
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,340
that involved someone's life.

410
00:22:07,341 --> 00:22:08,641
I guess so.

411
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:38,941
I really want to taste this.

412
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:40,640
He's looking at it again.

413
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:43,840
It's going to come falling again, the steel-frames!

414
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:45,041
Look out!

415
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:50,040
Oh, that was close. I almost drooled on my shirt.

416
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,041
Conan?

417
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:53,140
What are you doing?

418
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,641
I wonder.

419
00:23:57,941 --> 00:24:00,140
"Next Episode."

420
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:01,840
All done!

421
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:06,040
I hope you guys still remember that we came here to dig up clams.

422
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:09,840
It seems somebody's not enjoying himself much.

423
00:24:09,841 --> 00:24:11,240
See!

424
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,341
It seems you've forgotten one very important thing.

425
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:17,040
This is probably a blood stain.

426
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,041
Blood?

427
00:24:20,141 --> 00:24:22,041
No!

428
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,840
Next Conan,

429
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:28,041
"Clam Digging-Sigh (Part 1)"

430
00:24:43,741 --> 00:24:46,140
Next Conan's Hint:

431
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:48,540
"Pair look parkas"

432
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:50,440
I hope a bowl of eel over rice comes falling.

433
00:24:50,441 --> 00:24:51,540
It falling!

434
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:52,841
It could never happen.
