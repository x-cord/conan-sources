1
00:00:21,484 --> 00:00:23,283
The musical tone of the famed musical instrument brings about murder.

2
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:24,883
The disaster that befalls a family of musicians.

3
00:00:24,884 --> 00:00:26,383
Suddenly takes an unexpected turn!

4
00:00:26,384 --> 00:00:27,883
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:29,583
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:31,584
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54,258 --> 00:01:56,157
We were summoned by Ms. Hasuki Shitara

8
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:59,258
and went to visit Choichiro Shitara's residence. Pops, Ran and I.

9
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:01,757
Hasuki had called us

10
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:03,157
because incomprehensible accidents

11
00:02:03,158 --> 00:02:04,757
revolving around the famed musical instrument Stradivarius

12
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,957
have been occurring consecutively from the year before last.

13
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,658
Her request was for us to investigate these accidents.

14
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:12,157
However, as soon as we got there,

15
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:14,057
the annex went up in flames!

16
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:17,058
Genzaburo who was inside, dies.

17
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:21,857
Who's cigarette butt is this?

18
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:24,557
It doesn't seem to be yours, Pops.

19
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:26,557
That brand is the one...

20
00:02:26,558 --> 00:02:29,257
that Great Uncle Genzaburo used to smoke.

21
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:30,357
Come to think of it,

22
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,857
he stopped by here before going to the annex.

23
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:35,657
If so, then...

24
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:36,658
this is...

25
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,058
Kid, where do you think you're going?

26
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,958
Just as I thought.

27
00:02:45,058 --> 00:02:48,757
This is not an accident, but murder.

28
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:52,057
Moreover, if my deduction is correct,

29
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:53,758
the next target is...

30
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:01,158
"Cacophony of Stradivarius! Interlude!"

31
00:03:01,858 --> 00:03:05,857
What? You mean this fire is arson?

32
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:08,557
Yes. The cause of the fire is because he fell asleep while smoking,

33
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:11,057
and the source of the fire is around this ashtray.

34
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,058
But...

35
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:14,957
See, look at this cigarette butt

36
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,057
and this is the cigarette

37
00:03:16,058 --> 00:03:20,057
that Genzaburo was smoking back at the main house.

38
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:21,457
The brand is the same,

39
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,957
and there's nothing odd about it.

40
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,357
There is a trace of it being bitten.

41
00:03:25,358 --> 00:03:27,257
See.

42
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:29,457
Just like you, Pops...

43
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:33,057
People who work and talk while they smoke

44
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:35,657
have a habit of biting the filter of their cigarette.

45
00:03:35,658 --> 00:03:38,457
But there is no trace of this cigarette butt being bitten.

46
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,357
Don't you think it's strange?

47
00:03:40,358 --> 00:03:41,957
I see.

48
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,957
In order to make it look as if he fell asleep while smoking,

49
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,257
that the killer smoked several cigarettes

50
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:48,858
before setting the place on fire.

51
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:54,457
That is what you want to say, right?

52
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:59,757
But, the door of this room can only be locked from the inside.

53
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:02,058
How'd the killer leave the room then?

54
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:05,357
You've come across an idea of the kind of trick

55
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:06,657
that may have been used, right?

56
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:08,357
Oh no, not yet...

57
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:09,857
You're just a kid after all.

58
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,857
He could've just happened to bite the cigarette

59
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:15,657
that he smoked back at the main house, you know.

60
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:20,857
Besides, Genzaburo used to hate people cleaning up his room.

61
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:22,957
Despite that, isn't it strange

62
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,857
that there isn't even one cigarette filter that has bite traces?

63
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:28,357
"Benio Tsumagari (54)" -There's nothing strange about it.

64
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:29,657
"Steward for the Shitara family" -Because Genzaburo

65
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:33,957
used to always throw out the rubbish before going out.

66
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,257
But, it's amazing how you dashed out of the room.

67
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:39,357
Well, the fact is, this kid informed me.

68
00:04:39,358 --> 00:04:42,157
But if he threw out the rubbish, it's strange after all,

69
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:44,957
that he would smoke several cigarettes before falling asleep.

70
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:48,157
You idiot! That's not unusual at all.

71
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:53,058
He probably got sleepy when he was smoking his last cigarette.

72
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,857
That could be it, but...

73
00:04:57,858 --> 00:04:59,257
I wonder if it's okay?

74
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:02,457
This could be a serial murder case.

75
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,257
What?

76
00:05:04,258 --> 00:05:05,857
You shouldn't make such an irresponsible remark.

77
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:07,257
The name...

78
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:09,857
The initial of the name of the person,

79
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:13,157
Danjiro who died after being attacked by a robber is "D".

80
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:15,157
The initial of Eimi who died

81
00:05:15,158 --> 00:05:17,857
after falling off the stairs two years ago is "E".

82
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:20,657
The initial of Furuto who fell off the veranda

83
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:21,957
and died a year ago is "F".

84
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:25,458
And the initial of Genzaburo who died tonight is "G".

85
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,557
D-E-F-G...

86
00:05:29,558 --> 00:05:32,257
It's in alphabetical order.

87
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:35,257
If what all these people have in common

88
00:05:35,258 --> 00:05:39,957
is the birthday of the head of this household, Mr. Choichiro Shitara.

89
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,557
It could be as the kid says.

90
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:43,657
There's something fishy going on?

91
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:45,157
Wait!

92
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:46,957
D-E-F-G...

93
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:50,958
then the next target is Hasuki with the initial H.

94
00:05:54,058 --> 00:05:56,758
Oh no! She shouldn't be left alone!

95
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:01,257
What? I'm the next target?

96
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:02,857
Oh no, no way.

97
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:05,557
But alphabetically your name is next in line.

98
00:06:05,558 --> 00:06:07,357
"Kyosuke Haga (32), Choichiro's nephew" -Now that you mentioned it,

99
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:09,257
it's true that starting with Father Danjiro's initial D,

100
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:10,357
it continues E-F-G...

101
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:11,757
"Hasuki Shitara (23)" -in alphabetical order.

102
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:14,757
"Choichiro's granddaughter" -Come on, it's just a coincidence.

103
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:17,557
I guess so...

104
00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:19,357
But, we have a problem.

105
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:20,657
What about tonight's requiem?

106
00:06:20,658 --> 00:06:22,457
Requiem?

107
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,057
It's been a custom for generations in the Shitara family

108
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:28,857
that when someone passes away, someone plays the requiem.

109
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:31,457
Genzaburo played till last year.

110
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:35,857
Besides, Mr. and Mrs. Shitara is in no condition to play as you can see.

111
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:38,258
I... I can't possibly play either!

112
00:06:39,558 --> 00:06:41,857
Okay, I guess I'll play it then.

113
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:44,657
Why don't you all join us too?

114
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:46,157
A live performance by Kyosuke Haga

115
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:47,958
is not something you can listen to everyday, you know.

116
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:52,157
But, most of the musical instruments were in the annex.

117
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:55,057
The only instruments left are the piano and that...

118
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:58,457
Hey, hey, not that Stradivarius,

119
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,057
my hands'll shake.

120
00:07:00,058 --> 00:07:02,157
You can use my violin, then.

121
00:07:02,158 --> 00:07:06,157
No, I'll use the one I usually use that's in my car,

122
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:07,557
although it'll never come close

123
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:09,957
to that famed musical instrument that was made 300 years ago.

124
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,357
It's the only gift that Father ever gave me.

125
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:13,157
When it comes to tone quality,

126
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:15,357
it's second to none.

127
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:16,757
I don't want to use that famed musical instrument again

128
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:18,458
and have something happen.

129
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,557
Besides, if I take it out without asking Aunt Ayane,

130
00:07:21,558 --> 00:07:23,058
I think she'll be troubled.

131
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:26,457
Be troubled?

132
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:32,657
For Mrs. Shitara, that Stradivarius is her son, Furuto himself.

133
00:07:32,658 --> 00:07:34,457
That famed musical instrument that Furuto played

134
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,658
in front of Mr. Shitara just before his death is...

135
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:43,158
So, ever since then, at the stroke of midnight...

136
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:51,458
"Ayane Shitara (68), Choichiro's wife."

137
00:07:57,058 --> 00:07:59,957
"Choichiro Shitara (72), The head of the Shitara family."

138
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,557
Does Choichiro know about this?

139
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:05,257
Yes, most likely...

140
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:07,157
The storeroom for the Stradivarius

141
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:10,258
is between Grandfather and Grandmother's room.

142
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,357
I'm sure that Grandmother still sees

143
00:08:16,358 --> 00:08:19,858
my Father Furuto back then, in her heart.

144
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:42,858
Then, I shall begin.

145
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,657
Composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, "Requiem".

146
00:08:47,658 --> 00:08:49,858
Concerto in D major K-626.

147
00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:11,757
How nice.

148
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:18,557
Yes, Uncle Kyosuke graduated a music university in Germany with honors.

149
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,757
Why did he open the window, Kyosuke?

150
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:25,257
Probably so that Grandfather and Grandmother could listen to him play too.

151
00:09:25,258 --> 00:09:28,058
Grandmother's bedroom is right above.

152
00:09:34,358 --> 00:09:36,357
You mean that grandmother's room is connected

153
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:41,257
with grandfather's room with the storeroom of the Stradivarius in between?

154
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:43,157
If locked from the inside,

155
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:45,057
you cannot go through from the storeroom.

156
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:46,957
You can go inside from the corridor though,

157
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,657
with the master key that Ms. Tsumagari has.

158
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:52,257
They sleep in different rooms even if they're married.

159
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,357
Grandfather is a heavy smoker

160
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:57,157
and Grandmother hated the smoke.

161
00:09:57,158 --> 00:09:59,857
He didn't quit until he came down with lung cancer.

162
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:05,257
If Grandfather dies, who's going to receive that expensive violin?

163
00:10:05,258 --> 00:10:07,857
Great Uncle Genzaburo would have...

164
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,557
Maybe Grandmother?

165
00:10:09,558 --> 00:10:11,858
I wonder what Grandfather will do.

166
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,957
I feel that it is most appropriate for a musical genius

167
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,957
like Uncle Kyosuke to have it, though.

168
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,658
Conan, listen quietly, will you.

169
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:44,458
What's that sound?

170
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:03,158
Don't tell me that was?

171
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:21,688
Grandmother.

172
00:11:25,388 --> 00:11:26,787
Hurry, get an ambulance!

173
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:27,788
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:41,495
Grandmother's name is Ayane, so her initial is "A".

175
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:42,896
What does this mean?

176
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:48,395
I won't give it to anybody.

177
00:11:48,396 --> 00:11:50,396
It's mine.

178
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:54,195
Where's the storeroom?

179
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:56,296
To the right beyond.

180
00:11:58,796 --> 00:12:00,695
Hey.

181
00:12:00,696 --> 00:12:03,095
The door is locked from inside.

182
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:05,395
And the chair beside the window.

183
00:12:05,396 --> 00:12:06,696
Could it be suicide after all?

184
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:17,395
Well, well...

185
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:20,295
Mr. Mouri, another encounter with Death.

186
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:23,295
Come on. It's mere coincidence.

187
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:26,595
Inspector, and besides it's the saga of renown detectives,

188
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:28,995
to become involved in cases like these no matter where they go.

189
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:32,395
Then, I'd rather you stay still at home.

190
00:12:32,396 --> 00:12:34,695
The estimated time of the incident is around midnight.

191
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:36,495
The site is that window on the 3rd floor.

192
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:38,396
It seems to be her bedroom.

193
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:41,395
Where were you at that time?

194
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:44,695
Yes, sir. I was in the room right below with everyone else

195
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:47,395
listening to Kyosuke playing the Requiem.

196
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:48,995
Requiem?

197
00:12:48,996 --> 00:12:51,495
Yes, it seems to have been a custom handed down

198
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:54,495
for generations at the Shitara residence.

199
00:12:54,496 --> 00:12:55,895
Genzaburo, who burned to death

200
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:58,095
was the youngest of 3 brothers.

201
00:12:58,096 --> 00:12:59,795
The oldest is Choichiro.

202
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:03,495
The 2nd son Danjiro, who died 30 years ago

203
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:05,695
is Kyosuke's father.

204
00:13:05,696 --> 00:13:07,295
So, famed detective,

205
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:09,295
what do you think her motive for suicide was?

206
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:11,395
Oh, well, as to that... I have no idea yet.

207
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:14,896
I think it's the violin.

208
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:19,795
She's the steward for the Shitara family.

209
00:13:19,796 --> 00:13:22,196
Let's go to Mrs. Shitara's room.

210
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:25,395
This is...

211
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:27,395
Straduvarius.

212
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:29,495
Don't tell me that a robber broke in

213
00:13:29,496 --> 00:13:31,595
and Ayane fell out the window accidentally.

214
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:34,595
But this room was locked.

215
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:37,095
There are no signs of any struggling either.

216
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:40,095
There are no signs of anyone having come in here either.

217
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:42,595
The violin was probably already broken by someone

218
00:13:42,596 --> 00:13:44,395
before Mrs. Shitara opened the case.

219
00:13:44,396 --> 00:13:45,995
Maybe it was from that shock.

220
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:47,395
But, would she do something like that

221
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:50,695
-just because a musical instrument broke... -Don't you know,

222
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:54,195
that violin is a legendary violin that costs several billions of yen!

223
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:56,695
Moreover, Ayane was cherishing it

224
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:59,995
as if it were the double of her son, who died.

225
00:13:59,996 --> 00:14:01,495
If someone broke it,

226
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:03,895
I'm pretty sure that she'd feel like jumping out the window.

227
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:05,295
-Wrong. -What?

228
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:09,195
I think she broke it herself.

229
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:10,995
Not again, this brat...

230
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:13,795
By herself? What makes you think so?

231
00:14:13,796 --> 00:14:16,995
See, look at the new scratch on that table.

232
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:20,895
Grandmother probably threw this violin against it.

233
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:23,695
You idiot! She's not like Inspector Megure

234
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,995
who knows nothing of violins you know.

235
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:28,595
She would never do something like that!

236
00:14:28,596 --> 00:14:31,695
Yes, I think so too.

237
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:33,695
But, that's only if this violin is genuine.

238
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:35,396
What?

239
00:14:39,596 --> 00:14:43,995
Look at the label that is stuck to the inside of the violin.

240
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:46,895
The mark says "G.A".

241
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:49,495
If Antonio Stradivari made it,

242
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:52,096
the label should show "A.S"!

243
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:58,396
How come you know something like that?

244
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:03,395
Shinichi told me so some time ago.

245
00:15:03,396 --> 00:15:05,395
You mean that detective kid?

246
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:07,595
Come to think of it, Shinichi was really knowledgeable

247
00:15:07,596 --> 00:15:09,695
when it came to violins.

248
00:15:09,696 --> 00:15:12,095
Maybe because Holmes used to play it?

249
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:15,395
Then, what does "G.A" stand for?

250
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:18,095
The violin maker who made that violin

251
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:19,895
was just being playful and put his initial on the mark

252
00:15:19,896 --> 00:15:22,095
that was a replica of the real one.

253
00:15:22,096 --> 00:15:24,295
The replica is also famous

254
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:27,495
and a large amount had been made since some time ago.

255
00:15:27,496 --> 00:15:29,995
See, underneath the label,

256
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,995
it says "Made In Germany".

257
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:34,795
It's a 100% replica.

258
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:35,796
He's...

259
00:15:35,797 --> 00:15:39,095
Kyosuke that I mentioned a while ago.

260
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:43,195
Can you tell me who was listening to his Requiem in the room below?

261
00:15:43,196 --> 00:15:45,095
Yes, sir, Ran and I,

262
00:15:45,096 --> 00:15:46,495
that kid over there,

263
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:50,295
Hasuki, and the steward, Ms. Tsumagari, all four of us.

264
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:53,596
And Ayane fell to her death during this performance.

265
00:15:56,196 --> 00:15:58,695
But, why did Grandmother have to commit suicide,

266
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:04,196
after Uncle Kyosuke risked his life to save her from the flames?

267
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:07,195
Save her?

268
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:10,195
Yes, Kyosuke and Conan saved Ayane

269
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:12,196
who didn't make it in time out of the fire.

270
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:15,895
I still don't understand.

271
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:18,295
Why did she break the replica?

272
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:20,695
Don't tell me she thought it was genuine all this time

273
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:22,995
but realized only now that it was a replica.

274
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:24,895
That's isn't possible.

275
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:27,295
Mr. Shitara's violin has been appraised

276
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:29,596
and is guaranteed to be genuine.

277
00:16:30,596 --> 00:16:33,596
But, this case is genuine.

278
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:40,395
Isn't this the one?

279
00:16:40,396 --> 00:16:41,495
Grandfather.

280
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:43,595
It was hidden behind the bed.

281
00:16:43,596 --> 00:16:46,695
That Ayane, she dare treat it so carelessly.

282
00:16:46,696 --> 00:16:50,195
It has the label of Antonio Stradivari.

283
00:16:50,196 --> 00:16:52,595
So this is genuine.

284
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,895
When I saw it I knew it was.

285
00:16:54,896 --> 00:16:56,695
Would you like me to play it?

286
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:59,495
No, that won't be necessary if you say so.

287
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:00,895
What we see is good enough.

288
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:03,596
If so, what on earth is that?

289
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:08,995
Maybe another Stradivarius was placed here to surprise everyone.

290
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:11,195
But, after finding out that it was a replica, she was shocked and...

291
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,695
I see, so before her husband finds out

292
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:14,995
that she spent a lot of money on trash,

293
00:17:14,996 --> 00:17:16,495
she committed suicide.

294
00:17:16,496 --> 00:17:18,495
If so, everything falls into place.

295
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,195
Wrong!

296
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:22,395
When I came into this room a while ago,

297
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:24,795
I checked the bed but nothing was there!

298
00:17:24,796 --> 00:17:26,895
I'm sure that someone...

299
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:28,595
came to secretly replace the replica that was once exchanged

300
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:29,596
for the genuine Stradivarius,

301
00:17:29,597 --> 00:17:31,295
again with the genuine one.

302
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:33,495
Somebody for some reason came into this room

303
00:17:33,496 --> 00:17:36,795
-after I did and... -Conan.

304
00:17:36,796 --> 00:17:40,595
Maybe you should check the fingerprints that are on it.

305
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:43,795
Well, I'm sure you'll find fingerprints everywhere though.

306
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,596
Mine too, all over the place.

307
00:17:47,596 --> 00:17:50,495
Because I was tuning the Stradivarius

308
00:17:50,496 --> 00:17:52,395
in preparation for Uncle Choichiro's birthday since yesterday afternoon.

309
00:17:52,396 --> 00:17:54,995
-In this room? -Yes, sir.

310
00:17:54,996 --> 00:17:58,395
I handed it over to Hasuki after that, right?

311
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:01,495
Yes, I played it a little too,

312
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:02,995
so my fingerprints are also on it...

313
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:05,495
Was there anyone else there back then?

314
00:18:05,496 --> 00:18:06,895
I was alone.

315
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:10,295
Uncle Kyosuke left taking Grandmother with him to the garden,

316
00:18:10,296 --> 00:18:13,395
so that she wouldn't bother me.

317
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:15,295
I was showing Mr. Mouri the Stradivarius

318
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:18,395
when he arrived a while later

319
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:20,695
then we saw the annex on fire.

320
00:18:20,696 --> 00:18:24,195
In the meantime, I took the Stradivarius that was left as is on the table,

321
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:26,896
to the storeroom.

322
00:18:29,196 --> 00:18:35,095
Which means, anyone of you could've switched the violin.

323
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:39,195
But, Inspector, that doesn't matter now, does it?

324
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:41,195
The genuine one is back

325
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:45,095
and that kid over there is just saying what he wishes.

326
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:47,595
But, something's strange about this incident!

327
00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:49,995
What's so strange! This room was locked,

328
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:53,095
and the door of that storeroom was locked too.

329
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:54,895
Moreover, there is a chair by the window.

330
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:57,395
No matter how you look at it, it's suicide!

331
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:59,595
Where's the spare key to this room?

332
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,595
Other than what Mrs. Shitara was using,

333
00:19:01,596 --> 00:19:04,695
I have the master key.

334
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:08,396
Inspector, I found the key among the belongings of the corpse.

335
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:13,795
-I see. -See, this is not a serial murder case!

336
00:19:13,796 --> 00:19:15,595
Serial murder?

337
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:17,395
Well, according to this kid,

338
00:19:17,396 --> 00:19:19,595
he says that the killings started 30 years ago

339
00:19:19,596 --> 00:19:21,395
with the initial of the names of the members of the family,

340
00:19:21,396 --> 00:19:24,095
D-E-F-G in alphabetical order.

341
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:28,095
But, after the letter "G" of Genzaburo who died in the fire.

342
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:30,095
Ayane, with the initial "A" committed suicide.

343
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:33,496
That is, there was no connection.

344
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:37,495
-Maybe it's the musical scale? -What?

345
00:19:37,496 --> 00:19:40,395
D-E-F-G-A.

346
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:42,895
In Italian it would be Do-Re-Mi,

347
00:19:42,896 --> 00:19:47,095
but in English it is C-D-E-F-G-A-B.

348
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:49,495
Like they say the "C" chord.

349
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:51,495
I see.

350
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:54,295
Which means that the next alphabet would be "B".

351
00:19:54,296 --> 00:19:57,495
But, who has the initial "B"...

352
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,395
Benio Tsumagari.

353
00:19:59,396 --> 00:20:03,195
You mean the next target is I?

354
00:20:03,196 --> 00:20:05,095
Come to think of it, 30 years ago,

355
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:06,395
when I first started working here,

356
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:08,595
Mr. Shitara mentioned,

357
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:10,295
"If you belonged to our family,

358
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:14,895
we could go right up the scale from C to B"

359
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:17,695
I see, since Choichiro starts with a "C",

360
00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:20,295
that'll make C-D-E-F-G-A-B,

361
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:22,395
the entire musical scale.

362
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:24,695
I wonder if I said something like that.

363
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:29,696
Well, I'd like you all to wait inside your rooms for now, then.

364
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,396
Inspector, they're her footprints.

365
00:20:34,396 --> 00:20:35,495
From the looks of it,

366
00:20:35,496 --> 00:20:38,095
it seems she jumped down without a tinge of hesitation.

367
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:40,095
Without a tinge of hesitation?

368
00:20:40,096 --> 00:20:42,495
Inspector, I'm sure that it's suicide after all.

369
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:45,095
I mean this room was locked.

370
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:46,995
Locked...

371
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:47,996
Come to think of it,

372
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:51,195
the room that Genzaburo burned to death in was also locked.

373
00:20:51,196 --> 00:20:53,895
Before the fire, everyone was at the annex,

374
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:57,396
so the anyone of the four could've set fire to it.

375
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:01,595
But this room was also locked.

376
00:21:01,596 --> 00:21:04,196
I'm sure there's something to it.

377
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:07,795
What's that?

378
00:21:07,796 --> 00:21:09,895
See by the top of the window,

379
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:11,996
there's something transparent. That square thing.

380
00:21:14,696 --> 00:21:17,095
Is it a scotch tape or something?

381
00:21:17,096 --> 00:21:18,896
There is the same to the right too.

382
00:21:25,796 --> 00:21:27,895
Mr. Mouri was asking

383
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:31,696
if you saw anything strange near the corpse.

384
00:21:33,296 --> 00:21:34,596
Come to think of it...

385
00:21:39,196 --> 00:21:41,195
And one more thing.

386
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:43,796
There was something that looked like the tip of a chopstick.

387
00:21:47,096 --> 00:21:51,195
Yeah, we found something that looked to be the burnt remains of a case.

388
00:21:51,196 --> 00:21:54,495
Right, shaped something like this,

389
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:57,095
and maybe two thin sticks would fit into it.

390
00:21:57,096 --> 00:22:01,095
Which means that there was nothing in the case, right?

391
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:03,595
Right, if that is used,

392
00:22:03,596 --> 00:22:06,095
it would be possible to kill Ayane.

393
00:22:06,096 --> 00:22:08,196
The only thing left to solve is the locked room mystery.

394
00:22:15,596 --> 00:22:18,896
I see, so that's the story.

395
00:22:19,896 --> 00:22:21,896
But, there is one thing I don't understand...

396
00:22:22,896 --> 00:22:26,896
What is the killer so hung up on?

397
00:23:57,496 --> 00:23:59,395
"Next Episode" -You've figured out the killer.

398
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:04,395
The truth of what has been happening here at this house from two years ago.

399
00:24:04,396 --> 00:24:08,695
Why would this Stradivarius have anything to do with solving the mystery?

400
00:24:08,696 --> 00:24:11,495
There's just one thing I don't understand...

401
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:14,295
Cacophony. When notes that are alongside each other are played

402
00:24:14,296 --> 00:24:16,595
it sounds disharmonic...

403
00:24:16,596 --> 00:24:18,195
Don't tell me that...

404
00:24:18,196 --> 00:24:19,995
Grandfather!

405
00:24:19,996 --> 00:24:21,695
Conan?

406
00:24:21,696 --> 00:24:23,295
Next Conan,

407
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:27,196
"Cacophony of Stradivarius! Postlude!"

408
00:24:43,096 --> 00:24:45,095
Next Conan's Hint:

409
00:24:45,096 --> 00:24:46,995
"Perfect pitch."

410
00:24:46,996 --> 00:24:49,795
You've got to watch Conan's perfect pitching.

411
00:24:49,796 --> 00:24:51,796
What a play on words.
