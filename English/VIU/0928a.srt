1
00:00:08,953 --> 00:00:12,052
I see. This was a blind spot.

2
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,552
We were watching the back door

3
00:00:14,553 --> 00:00:16,752
since we expected passers-by out front.

4
00:00:16,753 --> 00:00:19,852
But why did Ihaya go outside?

5
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,752
We told you guys to stay in your room.

6
00:00:22,753 --> 00:00:24,052
We were going to the bathroom.

7
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:29,152
Ihaya, Agata, and I headed to the bathroom together.

8
00:00:29,153 --> 00:00:32,152
Ihaya said he was worried about leaving Keiko alone in the room,

9
00:00:32,153 --> 00:00:34,553
so he alone headed back.

10
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:40,552
I thought I saw him check his messages before he headed back.

11
00:00:40,553 --> 00:00:41,952
I see.

12
00:00:41,953 --> 00:00:46,052
Did Ihaya return immediately to the room?

13
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:47,552
No.

14
00:00:47,553 --> 00:00:50,252
I was afraid to stay alone in the room,

15
00:00:50,253 --> 00:00:52,652
so I left for the bathroom shortly afterwards.

16
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:57,152
It's possible he returned after I left the room.

17
00:00:57,153 --> 00:01:01,152
How long were the two of you in the bathroom?

18
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:03,852
I left the bathroom right away,

19
00:01:03,853 --> 00:01:05,652
but I got lost on the way back.

20
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:08,152
My stomach wasn't feeling great,

21
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:09,852
so I stayed in the bathroom for a while.

22
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:13,852
In other words, all three of you could've messaged Ihaya

23
00:01:13,853 --> 00:01:16,952
and murdered him.

24
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:18,052
What?

25
00:01:18,053 --> 00:01:19,252
But...

26
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:21,452
We'd never do that!

27
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:24,152
Now, now. You're not wrong,

28
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:27,652
but the blood spray and footprints on the inuyarai...

29
00:01:27,653 --> 00:01:31,952
It looks like they were painted on quite a while ago.

30
00:01:31,953 --> 00:01:36,452
When you were here before the body was discovered,

31
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:39,252
were these really not here?

32
00:01:39,253 --> 00:01:40,852
Yes.

33
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:46,653
Maybe we're all being tricked by a fox.

34
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:54,752
What's this mark?

35
00:01:54,753 --> 00:01:56,352
Huh?

36
00:01:56,353 --> 00:01:57,452
What?

37
00:01:57,453 --> 00:02:02,552
There are weird marks around the inuyarai.

38
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:05,052
Oh, man. I did what I always do.

39
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:08,152
You're right. It goes all the way around it.

40
00:02:08,153 --> 00:02:09,553
I wonder what it is.

41
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:14,552
Did he just say "Huh"?

42
00:02:14,553 --> 00:02:17,852
He's doing an impression of that brat now?

43
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:19,652
How imprudent.

44
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:21,752
Anyway, was there a code?

45
00:02:21,753 --> 00:02:24,352
Was it in his breast pocket again?

46
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,552
Yes.

47
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:27,752
Like Nishiki's murder,

48
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:31,253
it was there along with this paper plant leaf.

49
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,653
The third cipher.

50
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:38,652
They left another nonsensical cipher?

51
00:02:38,653 --> 00:02:44,952
And why are these four squares at the beginning Dekuri's mark?

52
00:02:44,953 --> 00:02:49,352
Maybe it's because the character for "de" in Dekuri is formed

53
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:52,552
if you draw a big square around them.

54
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:56,253
Draw a big square around them, huh?

55
00:02:58,653 --> 00:03:00,552
You're right.

56
00:03:00,553 --> 00:03:02,853
Hattori, your phone's ringing.

57
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:06,953
"Incoming Call, Kazuha" -It's Kazuha.

58
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:12,652
What is it, Kazuha? I'm...

59
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:15,352
Heiji, what are you doing?

60
00:03:15,353 --> 00:03:17,252
Didn't I tell you?

61
00:03:17,253 --> 00:03:20,853
I'm really sick with a cold, so I can't go to school.

62
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:24,352
Don't be ridiculous!

63
00:03:24,353 --> 00:03:27,052
I see you on TV!

64
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:28,452
What?

65
00:03:28,453 --> 00:03:30,452
Oh, yeah.

66
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:32,452
I wandered over to Kyoto

67
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:33,952
to find a good luck charm that cures colds.

68
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:35,852
What?

69
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:37,952
That's not a believable excuse.

70
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:40,152
In any case,

71
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:44,252
I need to solve a serial murder case and crack a code.

72
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:47,152
Don't tell my parents about this.

73
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:49,352
Hey, Heiji.

74
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:51,652
Those characters in the code

75
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:54,352
remind me of location names in Kyoto.

76
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:55,752
What?

77
00:03:55,753 --> 00:03:58,452
This character is the "hisashi"

78
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:00,252
in the Kamigyo Ward's Hisashi-cho.

79
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:04,552
To its left is the "to" in the Shimogyo Ward's Tokusayama-cho.

80
00:04:04,553 --> 00:04:08,452
To the left of that is the "adashi" in the Ukyo Ward's Adashino.

81
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:10,552
This is read "adashi"?

82
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:11,752
That's right.

83
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:13,552
Hold on.

84
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,152
If there are wards with top, bottom,

85
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:17,252
and right in their names, then...

86
00:04:17,253 --> 00:04:20,352
Yes. Kyoto contains the Kamigyo Ward,

87
00:04:20,353 --> 00:04:22,552
the Nakagyo Ward, the Shimogyo Ward,

88
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,452
the Sakyo Ward, and the Ukyo Ward.

89
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:27,552
Top, middle, bottom, and left and right are all represented.

90
00:04:27,553 --> 00:04:28,752
What?

91
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:30,152
Then maybe this...

92
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:31,652
Could it be...

93
00:04:31,653 --> 00:04:33,152
That must be it.

94
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:35,352
-Hey, Heiji! -What?

95
00:04:35,353 --> 00:04:38,652
I thought I heard Momiji's voice.

96
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:42,052
Why, little leaf. How have you been?

97
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:45,552
-Mo! -Let me handle Heiji.

98
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:48,652
You should focus on your studies.

99
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:50,652
-I... -Goodbye, now.

100
00:04:50,653 --> 00:04:53,653
I can't let you handle him, you idiot!

101
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:56,552
Can't let us handle it?

102
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:59,652
Are you going to clean the classroom yourself, Kazuha?

103
00:04:59,653 --> 00:05:01,552
That's not what I meant.

104
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:03,053
Gosh.

105
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:09,652
I believe we were in the middle of our conversation.

106
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:13,052
Why don't you tell us this time

107
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:18,453
about the man named Dekuri who came up with these three ciphers.

108
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,452
In my eyes are maximum creation!

109
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:24,252
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction!

110
00:05:24,253 --> 00:05:26,052
A serial murder stirs up trouble in Kyoto!

111
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:28,052
The tengu and the movie share a surprising connection!

112
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:29,652
He sees through the one and only truth.

113
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:31,552
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

114
00:05:31,553 --> 00:05:33,753
His name is Detective Conan!

115
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:59,553
"The Scarlet School Trip: Bright Red and Red Love Arcs"

116
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:04,201
"The Scarlet School Trip (Red Love Arc)"

117
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:10,801
"Ponto City"

118
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:12,700
Dekuri Michio?

119
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:18,301
Was he also your classmate at Gion Art School?

120
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:20,400
Yes.

121
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:24,400
He was in fine arts, but I was a music student.

122
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:26,600
I studied film.

123
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:30,100
Ihaya and I were in the acting school.

124
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,800
And Nishiki was a literary arts student.

125
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:35,400
How did you get to know each other

126
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:37,900
when you studied different majors?

127
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:41,400
We all joined the special effects film club.

128
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:44,900
Dekuri was also in the comics club, though.

129
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:49,700
Every year, we'd show the movie we filmed at the school festival.

130
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:52,900
I was always good at special effects.

131
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:56,900
Ihaya and I were masters of special effects makeup.

132
00:07:56,901 --> 00:08:01,300
And I'd compose eerie music for the completed film.

133
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:02,800
Nishiki would write the script,

134
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:07,000
and Dekuri would design the costumes and monsters, right?

135
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:10,200
When Dekuri was busy with his comics,

136
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:13,100
we all pitched in.

137
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:17,200
Agata was the only one who was really useful, though.

138
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:18,201
Yeah.

139
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:22,200
But the name Dekuri doesn't appear in the credits

140
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:26,901
of the graduation project "The Fighting Red Tengu" is based on.

141
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:31,400
Why is that?

142
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:34,400
What? Why aren't you saying anything?

143
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:36,500
Nishiki was having trouble

144
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:39,400
writing the script for our graduation project.

145
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:44,300
That's when he found a self-published comic Dekuri had produced.

146
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:47,000
It was a marvelous fantasy story.

147
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:50,300
It was "The Fighting Red Tengu", wasn't it?

148
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:51,800
Yes.

149
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:56,100
Dekuri said he planned to officially publish it

150
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:59,600
once he became a professional comic book artist,

151
00:08:59,601 --> 00:09:01,300
so he asked us not to use it.

152
00:09:01,301 --> 00:09:03,600
We thought Dekuri would accept it

153
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:06,400
once he saw the finished product,

154
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:08,600
so we decided to film his story.

155
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:11,900
And if we put his name in the credits,

156
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:14,800
it would be his graduation project, too.

157
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:18,101
But when he previewed the film in our club room...

158
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:21,000
This isn't my work!

159
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,600
You betrayed me!

160
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:24,300
Wait, Dekuri.

161
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:27,300
Don't put my name on it!

162
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,001
Dekuri!

163
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:34,300
Later, our graduation project received high praise.

164
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:38,600
The five of us were thrown into the limelight.

165
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:40,900
He totally hates you.

166
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:45,500
But the night we announced the movie,

167
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,901
I got a call from Dekuri.

168
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:51,200
He said he'd given up on drawing comics

169
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:54,500
and was working at a small design firm.

170
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:58,300
He asked us to put his name in the credits

171
00:09:58,301 --> 00:10:01,300
if we were going to remake that movie.

172
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:04,300
Dekuri said it was his dream

173
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:06,300
for his comics to be adapted for the big screen.

174
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:09,600
Did you put his name in the credits?

175
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:14,300
We were going to, but there was a little mistake.

176
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:19,100
When he saw his name wasn't in the credits at the first screening,

177
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:21,201
he killed himself over the disappointment.

178
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:27,300
We even thought about canceling the movie's release,

179
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:30,600
but our sponsors wouldn't let us.

180
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:32,201
I see.

181
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,900
Why?

182
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:40,700
Why are Heiji and the others allowed inside when we're not?

183
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:44,700
The little leaf left me to look after Heiji for once.

184
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:48,701
He seems to have the trust of Inspector Ayanokoji.

185
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:50,800
Seriously, who is he?

186
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:53,000
It's your job to do something about that.

187
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:54,700
Excuse me, Momiji.

188
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,200
What is it?

189
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:58,901
Where can I go to meet Okita?

190
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, that kendo brat

191
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:08,800
is probably practicing in the dojo around now.

192
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,101
If you have a message for him, I'll deliver it for you.

193
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:15,701
Actually, there's something I wanted to discuss with him in person.

194
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,300
Huh?

195
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,600
-It's you, Ran. -What?

196
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:22,000
Okita!

197
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:24,500
What are you doing here?

198
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:27,000
What are you doing here?

199
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:29,400
You brought all your henchmen with you.

200
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:32,900
I heard some tengu were running wild on Kiyamachi Way,

201
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,400
so I brought the club to wipe them out.

202
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:37,900
Why, thank you.

203
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:40,700
He looks exactly like Shinichi.

204
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,100
Does that mean...

205
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:46,501
This girl says she wanted to see you.

206
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:48,700
Really?

207
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:52,600
So you did come to Kyoto because you wanted to see me.

208
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:54,800
No...

209
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:57,201
-Come with me. -What?

210
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,011
Keiko Kurachi?

211
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:29,910
Kyoko.

212
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:32,610
We appeared in a lot of dramas together.

213
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:35,710
Of course, I always played the lead role.

214
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,610
Kyoko? Not Keiko?

215
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:40,910
Her real name is Kyoko.

216
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:45,210
After all she went through over her college graduation project,

217
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:47,810
she added the character for sun to the top of "kyo" for "Kyoto",

218
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:50,310
and made her stage name Keiko.

219
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,210
Really?

220
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:53,610
Speaking of names,

221
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:58,010
she said Nishiki and Mayama changed their names

222
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:01,010
just for that graduation project, too.

223
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:02,810
They changed their names?

224
00:13:02,811 --> 00:13:04,310
Yeah.

225
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:07,110
Mayama changed the mountain radical

226
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:10,010
of "mine" in "Mineto" from left to top,

227
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:13,710
and Nishiki changed his name from "Taro" to "Tarobo".

228
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:16,310
Come to think of it, Japan's most legendary tengu

229
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:18,810
is named Tarobo, too.

230
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:21,010
Oh, yeah. Speaking of Kyoko,

231
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:23,610
she fell in love during college and hasn't gotten married

232
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:28,010
because she's still in love with him.

233
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:29,410
I see.

234
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:32,810
Is that man's name Michio Dekuri?

235
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,910
No way. How did you know?

236
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:38,210
Hey, mom. That Dekuri guy...

237
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:39,811
How did you know?

238
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,510
She hung up.

239
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:45,210
A message from Sonoko?

240
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:46,211
What?

241
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:47,710
"Subject: Your wife is cheating on you"

242
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:49,010
Okita?

243
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:52,810
Why is Ran seeing Okita?

244
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:56,011
And what do their expressions mean?

245
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:58,910
Hey, Kudo.

246
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,810
What are you looking at?

247
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:01,910
Nothing.

248
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:04,710
-Let's go. -Go where?

249
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,410
To the Gion Hotel.

250
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:10,710
When Nishiki tried to reserve a smoking room,

251
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:13,710
at first, they told him they were fully booked,

252
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:15,810
but a reservation was canceled while he was on the phone,

253
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:17,810
so he got a room after all.

254
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:19,910
Curious, right?

255
00:14:19,911 --> 00:14:21,810
Yeah.

256
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,510
You're right.

257
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:25,811
I'm curious about this, too.

258
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:31,410
Yes, that's correct.

259
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:33,710
A reservation was canceled

260
00:14:33,711 --> 00:14:35,110
while we were on the phone with Mr. Nishiki.

261
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:38,310
He reserved the room for two days starting yesterday.

262
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,910
I see.

263
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:43,410
Come to think of it, you smoke, too, Agata.

264
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:45,910
Were you able to get a room right away?

265
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:47,010
Yeah.

266
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,610
Someone else canceled right after Nishiki called.

267
00:14:50,611 --> 00:14:54,010
We were gathered in Nishiki's apartment

268
00:14:54,011 --> 00:14:56,010
and made our reservations together.

269
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:58,410
-Right? -Yes.

270
00:14:58,411 --> 00:15:00,510
Is this true?

271
00:15:00,511 --> 00:15:01,610
Yes.

272
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:03,910
After Mr. Nishiki made a reservation,

273
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:08,310
someone else canceled, and Mr. Agata reserved the room.

274
00:15:08,311 --> 00:15:12,010
It was a group of guests who canceled.

275
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,210
Speaking of Agata's room,

276
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:17,810
a giant tengu apparently appeared inside it.

277
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:21,310
Is it true that nothing strange was found in the room after that?

278
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:26,210
Yes. There was a glue-like substance on the burned ceiling,

279
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:31,010
but it wasn't nearly enough to support a large object.

280
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:33,810
There were also marks left by the chair

281
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:35,910
when Agata fell out of it

282
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:39,010
and a roughly three centimeter burn in the carpet

283
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:42,010
when a cigarette fell from the ashtray thrown at the tengu.

284
00:15:42,011 --> 00:15:44,710
And for some reason, there was another pillow

285
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,310
in the middle of the bed.

286
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:49,110
That's a habit of mine.

287
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:53,810
What is it? Something in that didn't sound right.

288
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:56,510
The glue on the ceiling...

289
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:58,611
The marks left by the chair...

290
00:15:59,611 --> 00:16:02,310
I'm Soshi Okita.

291
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:04,010
The cigarette burn...

292
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:05,811
I wonder if we'll get to see Okita.

293
00:16:06,611 --> 00:16:08,410
The pillow in the center of the bed...

294
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:10,311
Your wife is cheating on you.

295
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:14,310
Gosh.

296
00:16:14,311 --> 00:16:16,310
I can't focus on the case

297
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:18,810
because I keep thinking of that picture of them.

298
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,810
I don't have time to think about that right now.

299
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:23,711
What? Time?

300
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:28,110
Gosh. There it is.

301
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:30,710
It's sooner than yesterday.

302
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:33,210
Hey, Kudo. You okay?

303
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:34,510
Yeah.

304
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:36,910
More importantly, I know who did it.

305
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:37,911
-What? -What?

306
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:38,911
Seriously?

307
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:44,110
But there's not enough evidence to arrest them.

308
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:47,210
Then what are we going to do, Kudo?

309
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:48,510
Inspector Ayanokoji.

310
00:16:48,511 --> 00:16:49,610
What is it?

311
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:53,710
Could I get some assistance from the Kyoto police?

312
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:56,110
Yes, if we're able.

313
00:16:56,111 --> 00:17:03,611
It may be a little... embarrassing, though.

314
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:10,870
"The next day" -In any case, since a new cipher

315
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:13,270
was found on the body of Ihaya yesterday,

316
00:17:13,271 --> 00:17:19,570
the culprit may be planning to kill another one of you.

317
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,470
Please remain in your rooms

318
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:25,570
until it's time to check out.

319
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:27,470
To be safe,

320
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:31,570
we'll be posting an officer outside each of your rooms.

321
00:17:31,571 --> 00:17:33,270
Thank you.

322
00:17:33,271 --> 00:17:34,671
Goodbye.

323
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:39,870
Hey, Kudo. Are you okay?

324
00:17:39,871 --> 00:17:41,570
Yeah, just barely.

325
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:43,670
I took my medicine late this morning.

326
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:45,370
-Your medicine? -What?

327
00:17:45,371 --> 00:17:47,270
What medicine?

328
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:49,270
Cold medicine.

329
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:51,470
Really?

330
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:54,870
This has turned into quite the visit.

331
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:59,070
Yeah. We never even made it to Dekuri's grave.

332
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:01,270
We'll have to go another time.

333
00:18:01,271 --> 00:18:02,470
You're right.

334
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:04,771
-See you later. -Yeah.

335
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:13,371
Your dream?

336
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:17,770
That's your dream, Dekuri?

337
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:18,870
Yeah.

338
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:23,270
Seeing the words "based on a comic by Michio Dekuri"

339
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:25,171
on the big screen is my dream.

340
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:45,270
Really?

341
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:49,271
You'll really put my name in the credits?

342
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:54,970
Of course. You're the one who wrote the story.

343
00:18:54,971 --> 00:18:57,070
-I'm glad. -What?

344
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:59,870
I've actually always regretted it.

345
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:03,170
Your graduation project was so well made,

346
00:19:03,171 --> 00:19:06,470
I said that out of frustration.

347
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:09,971
I'm sorry. And thank you.

348
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:23,971
What's wrong, Dekuri?

349
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:28,170
We need to leave. They're closing the theater.

350
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:29,970
That's odd.

351
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:33,670
No matter how long I wait, my name never appears.

352
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:35,271
Isn't that strange?

353
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,370
Where are you going?

354
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:08,570
To the bathroom.

355
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:11,370
The bathroom in my room isn't working.

356
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:13,270
I'm going to the bathroom in the lobby.

357
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:14,870
I'll be right back.

358
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:16,371
Be careful.

359
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:22,871
Hello?

360
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:33,170
To Kiyomizu Temple.

361
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:34,471
Very well.
