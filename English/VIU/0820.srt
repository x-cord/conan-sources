00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:23,480
A canvas stained black with crime.

Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

3
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:28,180
Seven people with issues are confined

4
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:30,480
in the waiting room of a station just like in a drama.

5
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,080
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:34,080
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:36,481
His name is Detective Conan!

"Five hours earlier" "6:30 pm"

11
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:33,527
What a surprise.

12
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,827
We suddenly run into a typhoon on the day we're returning to Tokyo.

13
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:38,727
"Yuichi Hokari (35)" -Yes, really what a surprise.

14
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:42,828
To be with the famed Detective Sleeping Kogoro!

15
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:47,627
Thank you for waiting, everyone.

16
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:49,527
"Kikuo Inagaki (58), Masako Ueno (28)" -What a day.

17
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:51,727
The weather forecast was totally off.

18
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:54,127
Hurry and get everyone towels, will you?

19
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:56,527
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:57,627
"Hitoshi Takegami (54)" -This is the same as how my life is.

21
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:02,327
A succession of "suddenly" and "forecasts that are off".

22
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:04,627
In times like that, here's something for you!

23
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:06,327
I'll give it to you at a low price.

24
00:03:06,328 --> 00:03:08,527
Fully guaranteed to never go off!

25
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:11,527
How dare you! Just how many people did you deceive till now?

26
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:14,427
I never deceived anyone.

27
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:17,727
I just introduced good value loans.

28
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:20,927
I trusted you and my factory went bankrupt.

29
00:03:20,928 --> 00:03:23,427
Rather, it was driven into bankruptcy by the bank!

30
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:28,827
Listen, I'm not from the bank.

31

"Carl Morris (26), Backpacker"

Let me help you!

33
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:36,827
Thanks for the thought.

34
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:38,227
How modest!

35
00:03:38,228 --> 00:03:41,427
Just like hot springs, it's Japan's specialty.

36
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:44,227
"Ofumoto's Attraction, Train Station Hot Spring" -I love Japan!

37
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:46,627
Your Japanese is good.

38
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:49,627
He talks a bit funny though.

39
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:53,527
I travel the country and learn the language of that country.

40
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:56,827
That's my specialty!

41
00:03:56,828 --> 00:04:00,828
"Noriko Kurusu (40)" -You guys! I wish you'd be a bit more quiet!

42
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:05,328
I tell you, that's why I hate the countryside.

43
00:04:06,928 --> 00:04:09,627
What time does the next train get here?

44
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:12,327
I'm sure there's still a train bound for Tokyo.

45
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:14,127
I'm very sorry.

46
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,927
I've been told that in-bound and out-bound trains are stopped for now.

47
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:18,928
Is that correct?

48
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:20,327
Yes, sir.

49
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:23,527
Are you serious?

50
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:24,927
You must be joking!

51
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:26,827
If I don't make it in time tomorrow's lecture,

52
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:29,227
who's going to take responsibility for it?

53
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,427
My boss is at the next station waiting for me!

54
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:33,927
Your boss?

55
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:36,527
I think it's him.

56
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:40,227
Shonosuke Yuhara. A city councilor.

57
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:41,827
In other words, you're...

58
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:45,227
Mr. Yuhara secretary, right?

59
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:48,727
I came before him to make preparations for tomorrow.

60
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:51,827
By the way, who drew that poster?

61
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:53,727
-It's me. -You did?

62
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:55,027
Yes.

63
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,927
My boss's name is too small!

64
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:00,827
Fix it, okay. I'm going to borrow the phone.

65
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:02,327
But...

66
00:05:02,328 --> 00:05:05,727
I'm sorry, you can't use the phone here,

67
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:08,427
because of the typhoon. Right?

68
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:09,627
That's right.

69
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:13,427
Which means we're all spending the night here together?

70
00:05:13,428 --> 00:05:15,227
It sure sounds like fun!

71
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:16,827
You've gotta be kidding!

72
00:05:16,828 --> 00:05:19,427
We're sure in a fix, aren't we?

73
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:21,227
Conan, are you okay?

74
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:24,127
Yep, I'm okay, but...

75
00:05:24,128 --> 00:05:26,527
"Fune Shimao (70)" -Isn't dinner ready yet?

76
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:27,727
Dinner.

77
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,427
She's right, dinner.

78
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:31,127
I'm starved.

79
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:32,727
Is there a dining room or something?

80
00:05:32,728 --> 00:05:33,927
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:38,327
Hey, don't we have some light meals and candies in the gift corner?

82
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:40,127
Boil the water immediately

83
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:44,227
and give the women and child blankets, will you?

84
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:45,427
Yes.

85
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,827
Wait, I'll go too.

86
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:49,927
I'm sorry, she's not up to it.

87
00:05:49,928 --> 00:05:53,627
She still new here, so I've got to keep an eye on her.

88
00:05:53,628 --> 00:05:57,628
Please spend your time as you wish, until the train recover.

89
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:02,027
May we also go to the hot spring?

90
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,127
Of course.

91
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:05,327
All right!

92
00:06:05,328 --> 00:06:08,327
Shall we all go then, everyone?

93
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:10,827
Hot springs? The bus to the hot spring is not coming though.

94
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:14,527
No, I think he means the hot spring of this station, Dad.

95
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:17,528
"Train Station Hot Spring"

96
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:28,527
It rains in the hot spring too.

97
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:31,027
If we get to float sake in the water or something, it'll be just great.

98
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:33,227
It sounds really good.

99
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:36,027
Conan, why don't you come over this side?

100
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,227
I'll wash your back for you!

101
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:42,227
No, thanks, Ran. I'm fine!

102
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:44,927
I'm getting out.

103
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:46,827
Me too.

104
00:06:46,828 --> 00:06:48,827
There was no key for the locker,

105
00:06:48,828 --> 00:06:52,427
so we'd better beware of poor tourists.

106
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:56,228
I guess nasty jokes are also a specialty of Japan!

107
00:06:57,428 --> 00:06:58,527
All right!

108
00:06:58,528 --> 00:07:02,327
I'm going to get some local liquor at the gift corner after this.

109
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:03,628
I thought so.

110
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:08,627
What's this?

111
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:12,327
Let me see!

112
00:07:12,328 --> 00:07:13,927
This is...

113
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:19,327
It says, "Mr. Mouri, somebody will be killed here tonight."

114
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:21,127
If this is true,

115
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:23,327
we wouldn't want the perpetrator to know about it, right?

116
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:26,327
But, this could be a prank, you know?

117
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:29,227
This thing is not complete.

118
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:30,527
Maybe the person didn't have time

119
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:32,727
to write down the name of the perpetrator?

120
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:36,027
"The culprit is..."

121
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:38,527
So then, who is it?

122
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:39,827
Who done it?

123
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:44,227
It's your job to find out, famed detective.

124
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:45,527
You were listening.

125
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:48,327
I adore Watson.

126
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:52,127
You can count on me as the assistant to a famed detective.

127
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:54,727
Or, it's also thinkable that he wrote it too, right?

128
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:57,827
Because he was the first to get out of the tub.

129
00:07:57,828 --> 00:08:00,727
What? What's up?

130
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:02,828
So, is he.

131
00:08:04,928 --> 00:08:06,327
It's nothing.

132
00:08:06,328 --> 00:08:11,227
It's none of your business.

133
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:14,427
Sir, where and what were you doing

134
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:16,627
when we were taking a bath?

135
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:17,827
Hey!

136
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:21,127
It's rude to ask a stranger something like that!

137
00:08:21,128 --> 00:08:26,027
I'm sorry. He loves to copy me and play detective.

138
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:28,327
I was here right through.

139
00:08:28,328 --> 00:08:31,227
Because I had nothing and nowhere to go.

140
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:32,727
That's my life.

141
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:34,427
And is there anyone who can prove that?

142
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:37,028
I can prove it for him.

143
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:42,527
He was right there grumbling up.

144
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:43,827
Right through.

145
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:46,127
Which means you were here too.

146
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:50,127
That's right. But, we may also be lying for each other.

147
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:52,527
Hey, just what do you mean by that?

148
00:08:52,528 --> 00:08:53,927
Only joking.

149
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:56,227
I'm just playing along with the detective game.

150
00:08:56,228 --> 00:08:59,027
Geez, even my mail comes back undelivered!

151
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:02,427
Since we're playing detective, I'll tell you something else too.

152
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:07,427
Rather, if you're a famed detective, I'm sure you're already aware.

153
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:11,027
That man's a swindler.

154
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:12,827
That one's a pickpocket.

155
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:14,628
What?

156
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:17,527
Don't be ridiculous.

157
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:19,227
Where's the proof?

158
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:22,227
He had a load of pamphlets from different companies.

159
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,227
Paraphernalia for swindlers.

160
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:27,127
Approaching people after pretending to pick things that have been dropped

161
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:29,227
is a usual trick used by pickpockets.

162
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:31,027
Inviting people to go and take baths is also a method used.

163
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,628
She's right. But...

164
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:37,027
Is dinner ready yet?

165
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:40,727
You just ate, didn't you, granny?

166
00:09:40,728 --> 00:09:43,627
You even ate up my cup noodles.

167
00:09:43,628 --> 00:09:45,527
Who are you?

168
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:47,927
Hey, did you forget already?

169
00:09:47,928 --> 00:09:51,227
And I was nice enough to give you food, and yet...

170
00:09:51,228 --> 00:09:52,527
Granny,

171
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:54,027
we'll have your family come pick you up

172
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:56,527
after the phones start working again, okay?

173
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:59,727
Oh, Masako, good work.

174
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:02,127
So, you're just pretending you forgot.

175
00:10:02,128 --> 00:10:03,827
-What an unpleasant old woman. -Is Sue doing well?

176
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:07,727
My grandma died last year.

177
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:10,027
If so, please start dinner.

178
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:12,027
What a hopeless daughter-in-law.

179
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,127
Yes... I will, ma'am.

180
00:10:14,128 --> 00:10:15,627
Darn it!

181
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:18,628
Everyone here seems suspicious.

182
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:24,428
"11:10 pm"

183
00:10:44,128 --> 00:10:46,327
Where are you going?

184
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:49,127
I can't be wasting my time here.

185
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,127
I've got to make arrangements to meet my boss.

186
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:53,527
I guess I'll go flag a cab down somewhere.

187
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,527
There are no cabs around.

188
00:10:56,528 --> 00:10:59,627
Please stay here and don't move.

189
00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:00,827
What do you mean?

190
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,127
How dare you tell me what to do?

191
00:11:03,128 --> 00:11:04,528
Get out of my way!

192
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:09,427
What was that?

193
00:11:09,428 --> 00:11:10,828
Close the door!

194
00:11:14,428 --> 00:11:15,727
She's gone.

195
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:17,427
Don't tell me that.

196
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:19,327
Dad, get up!

197
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,527
Hey, dad!

198
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:24,327
What is it?

199
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:28,427
That woman secretary went out alone.

200
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:31,927
What?

201
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:33,227
This is...

202
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:36,427
Pops, where's the memo?

203
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:38,828
What? Did I drop it?

204
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:41,927
I wonder if she picked it up and read it?

205
00:11:41,928 --> 00:11:43,028
It can't be!

206
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:46,127
Conan?

207
00:11:46,128 --> 00:11:48,127
I'll go too!

208
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:50,127
Same here too!

209
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:52,028
I guess I've got no choice.

210
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:59,127
It's hard to believe she went walking out in this strong rain.

211
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:01,727
Maybe she's taking shelter somewhere.

212
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:04,227
Let's go look for her!

213
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:07,727
Hey. Don't go moving around on your own!

214
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:08,828
I tell you.

215
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:14,328
A gunshot?

216
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:16,528
That way!

217
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,228
What? Hey!

218
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:20,627
This is...

219
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:22,027
What's up, Conan?

220
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:23,728
What?

221
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,225
This is a homicide.

222
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:34,925
I feel bad doing this to the victim, Noriko,

223
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:37,725
but in order to preserve the scene of the crime,

224
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:41,725
all I did was leave her as is and put a blanket over her.

225
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:43,925
She was murdered?

226
00:12:43,926 --> 00:12:45,725
What do you mean?

227
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:50,625
She was probably shot to death.

228
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:53,025
But, why her?

229
00:12:53,026 --> 00:12:54,425
Who's the perpetrator?

230
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:55,825
Don't worry.

231
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:59,825
I, Kogoro Mouri, will definitely find the perpetrator

232
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:01,625
from among you, the suspects.

233
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:03,725
Wait a minute, there!

234
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:06,325
Why am I a suspect?

235
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:09,825
Holmes would never suspect Watson!

236
00:13:09,826 --> 00:13:11,725
You've got motive.

237
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:15,025
You killed her because the victim saw through your true identity.

238
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:17,126
-No! -No!

239
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:23,226
Is dinner ready yet?

240
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:26,226
Who are you?

241
00:13:29,826 --> 00:13:34,925
There's someone who wrote this, addressed to me.

242
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:38,325
Are you saying that what's written there is about this murder?

243
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:41,525
You mean you were warned about it and yet you couldn't prevent it,

244
00:13:41,526 --> 00:13:43,525
famed detective my foot.

245
00:13:43,526 --> 00:13:44,725
It wasn't a warning

246
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:47,825
but rather, somebody was asking the famed detective for help.

247
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,525
But, he couldn't prevent it.

248
00:13:49,526 --> 00:13:50,825
It's the same thing, isn't it?

249
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:53,326
If it's referring to this murder...

250
00:13:58,026 --> 00:14:00,525
Okay, let me confirm your alibis once more

251
00:14:00,526 --> 00:14:03,325
and also check your belongings.

252
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:08,725
Where and what were you doing when Conan and I went outside?

253
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:10,225
And...

254
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:12,525
The gun?

255
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:17,125
It's probably been disposed of or hidden by the perpetrator already.

256
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:20,525
Well, I guess it can't be helped because you're not Holmes.

257
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,325
As for me, I was in back of the station.

258
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:25,625
I was alone so I don't have an alibi.

259
00:14:25,626 --> 00:14:28,025
And, please take a look at this.

260
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:32,125
I was alone on the platform, so I don't have an alibi.

261
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:36,125
That's you already saw what's inside, but help yourself.

262
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,225
What about you?

263
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:41,425
I was in the restroom, rather, at the kiosk.

264
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:43,825
I was thirsty and wanted a drink.

265
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:45,225
Alone?

266
00:14:45,226 --> 00:14:48,825
Yeah. No, rather, that granny was there.

267
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:51,225
She was pigging out on food.

268
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:54,425
I guess testifying is difficult for her.

269
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,225
And, I protest having my belongings checked.

270
00:14:57,226 --> 00:14:59,225
A detective has no such right.

271
00:14:59,226 --> 00:15:01,425
Well, that's true.

272
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:04,025
But, I'm not a detective.

273
00:15:04,026 --> 00:15:07,325
What the heck are you doing? Hey!

274
00:15:07,326 --> 00:15:08,726
Why you!

275
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:11,925
Is something missing?

276
00:15:11,926 --> 00:15:15,025
No, nothing's missing.

277
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:17,726
I tell you, you love to keep us in suspense, don't you?

278
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:22,726
I guess we'll just have to experiment then.

279
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,425
Amazing!

280
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:31,025
You've got nice handwriting.

281
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:33,325
You mean we should compare handwritings?

282
00:15:33,326 --> 00:15:35,225
Please write.

283
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,925
I think it's useless.

284
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:40,525
You can fool people all you want if you put your mind to it.

285
00:15:40,526 --> 00:15:42,925
No, it just may work.

286
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:44,625
Although handwriting can be mimicked,

287
00:15:44,626 --> 00:15:47,226
there are habits that can't be changed.

288
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:51,725
Why didn't I realize it?

289
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:53,526
That person's the one who wrote it!

290
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:58,726
It's a black out!

291
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:08,525
This is bad!

292
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:09,825
Masako?

293
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:11,025
How terrible!

294
00:16:11,026 --> 00:16:12,726
Who on earth did this?

295
00:16:14,226 --> 00:16:15,625
She's still breathing.

296
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:18,425
Ran, will you search for a towel and first aid kit?

297
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:19,725
Okay!

298
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:21,626
Everybody, stay where you are!

299
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:24,626
This is...

300
00:16:24,627 --> 00:16:27,725
Could it be that she wrote it?

301
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:31,125
Yep, look at that.

302
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:34,225
That poster of the city councilor.

303
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,325
"Mister"

304
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:38,025
It's the same habit!

305
00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:41,025
"An Impostor" -This is half torn too.

306
00:16:41,026 --> 00:16:42,925
So, the perpetrator did it?

307
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:44,825
It was written, "So-and-so is an imposter"

308
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:47,825
that's why it's torn off.

309
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:49,525
It's that granny!

310
00:16:49,526 --> 00:16:52,025
Conversing with her was all messed up.

311
00:16:52,026 --> 00:16:53,725
She gave herself away.

312
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:57,325
Huh? That granny's not here?

313
00:16:57,326 --> 00:17:00,425
Did she flee?

314
00:17:00,426 --> 00:17:01,726
What wrong, Ran?

315
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,625
Granny?

316
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:11,925
I thought so.

317
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:14,726
Stop it! Give it back to me.

318
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,425
Today is the day for burnable trash.

319
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:21,225
Don't throw this away.

320
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:24,425
I tell you, what a hopeless daughter-in-law.

321
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:26,126
Oh, its so heavy.

322
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:32,025
Nice catch!

323
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:34,225
Just as expected of you!

324
00:17:34,226 --> 00:17:36,725
Is this your gun?

325
00:17:36,726 --> 00:17:38,425
I smell gunpowder.

326
00:17:38,426 --> 00:17:40,325
You're the perpetrator!

327
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,925
I was testing it.

328
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:45,325
Before I came here, in the mountains.

329
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:47,825
You were target practicing?

330
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:51,025
No! After my factory went bankrupt,

331
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:53,625
I was threatened by some loan sharks

332
00:17:53,626 --> 00:17:56,425
and started smuggling remodeled guns,

333
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:58,225
but it didn't work out well.

334
00:17:58,226 --> 00:18:00,425
I thought the only way out was to die and came here.

335
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:02,726
But, I couldn't die.

336
00:18:04,426 --> 00:18:06,825
But I would never shoot anybody just because of something like that.

337
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:08,725
I'm not the perpetrator.

338
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:10,825
It's the truth.

339
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:13,625
It does look like a remodeled gun,

340
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,625
but there's no way to match the bullets here.

341
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:19,526
Besides, he's not the imposter.

342
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:37,525
Since there's no way there'd be a taxi out here,

343
00:18:37,526 --> 00:18:41,625
I wonder why did the victim go outside?

344
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:43,726
Wait second. If I remember correctly, back then...

345
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:51,226
I wonder what she was trying to look at anyway?

346
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:56,525
I can't see...

347
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:59,026
I see! That's why she went outside!

348
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:07,425
That's...

349
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:09,725
A picture's been removed?

350
00:19:09,726 --> 00:19:13,025
Maybe she was killed because she saw it?

351
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,225
And after that, the perpetrator removed the picture?

352
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:17,625
Which means...

353
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:18,825
I get it!

354
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:20,325
If so, it's understandable why

355
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:24,525
that person reacted that way to granny back then!

356
00:19:24,526 --> 00:19:26,125
And, one more thing.

357
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:29,625
When Masako saw this poster, something crossed her mind.

358
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,125
Right afterwards she was attacked during the black out.

359
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:34,825
No doubt about it, she found out.

360
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:37,126
Who the real target of the perpetrator was.

361
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:53,525
"Shonosuke Yuhara (65)" -The train's finally started running,

362
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,326
and yet where is my secretary?

363
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:09,426
Who the heck are you?

364
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:19,226
What the...

365
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:28,726
I see! The imposter...

366
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:33,025
was you, the station master!

367
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:37,525
Right, one false move could cause harm to someone.

368
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:38,925
Despite being threatened,

369
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:42,925
Masako tried to let you know when the perpetrator was off guard, Pops.

370
00:20:42,926 --> 00:20:45,825
But, when the perpetrator found out, Masako was attacked.

371
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:47,025
How terrible!

372
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:49,125
"Kozo Yamazaki (60)" -He's the terrible one.

373
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:51,525
My son died because of him.

374
00:20:51,526 --> 00:20:53,925
He became the scapegoat for the bribe that Yuhara accepted.

375
00:20:53,926 --> 00:20:56,225
And was driven to commit suicide!

376
00:20:56,226 --> 00:21:00,025
Then, you killed her because she found out who you were?

377
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:04,125
She didn't say what she was supposed to in the past

378
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:05,225
because she wanted to protect herself,

379
00:21:05,226 --> 00:21:09,625
although she knew that my son, who was her colleague was innocent.

380
00:21:09,626 --> 00:21:12,625
She got what she deserved!

381
00:21:12,626 --> 00:21:13,725
I bet you were surprised

382
00:21:13,726 --> 00:21:17,925
because you thought that granny saw you through, right?

383
00:21:17,926 --> 00:21:21,025
Yeah. But, it was needless worry.

384
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:23,525
I just did everything to avenge the death of my son.

385
00:21:23,526 --> 00:21:27,425
That doesn't give you the right to take someone else's life!

386
00:21:27,426 --> 00:21:29,625
You even hurt Masako.

387
00:21:29,626 --> 00:21:34,025
Your son would never want you doing anything like this.

388
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,925
Of course, it wouldn't make him happy either.

389
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:37,126
No way for sure.

390
00:23:05,726 --> 00:23:09,325
Station employee, Masako who was taken to the hospital,

391
00:23:09,326 --> 00:23:11,626
safely made it out alive.

392
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:18,425
This is the real station master?

393
00:23:18,426 --> 00:23:21,625
Great, all's well.

394
00:23:21,626 --> 00:23:24,826
So, those guys were on the wanted list after all.

395
00:23:26,226 --> 00:23:28,825
Hurry, and make breakfast, will you?

396
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:31,225
A hopeless son-in-law, indeed.

397
00:23:31,226 --> 00:23:34,025
Hey, hold it.

398
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:36,225
Hey, Dad! Where are you going?

399
00:23:36,226 --> 00:23:38,525
I'm not your son-in-law!

400
00:23:38,526 --> 00:23:40,726
See you. I guess we'll leave you behind, then.

401
00:23:42,826 --> 00:23:44,925
"Next Episode" -Yes, it's the perpetrator

402
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:48,926
who robbed 30 million yen from Beika City that night.

403
00:23:50,026 --> 00:23:52,726
They're saying to stop the reconstruction?

404
00:23:53,826 --> 00:23:57,025
The corpse is somewhere in Dongaraji Temple?

405
00:23:57,026 --> 00:24:00,425
I'll bet you guys killed your father!

406
00:24:00,426 --> 00:24:02,025
-What? -What?

407
00:24:02,026 --> 00:24:05,426
To continue illegally keep receiving his pension!

408
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:12,826
