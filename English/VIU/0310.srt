1
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:04,585
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,586 --> 00:00:06,685
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:06,686 --> 00:00:08,485
The conspiracy of the Black Organization is about to be confirmed.

4
00:00:08,486 --> 00:00:10,985
The truth becomes clearer after one incident and another.

5
00:00:10,986 --> 00:00:12,585
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:14,485
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,486 --> 00:00:16,286
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,064
Dr. Agasa and I got a hint of coming in contact with

9
00:01:58,065 --> 00:02:00,864
the Black Organization from the diary of Mr. Itakura who had been killed.

10
00:02:00,865 --> 00:02:04,765
Therefore, we came over to Mr. Itakura's villa.

11
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:07,265
Then...

12
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:15,565
Hey, what's going on?

13
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:18,865
Vodka?

14
00:02:19,865 --> 00:02:21,564
You're there, aren't you?

15
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:23,264
They've found out.

16
00:02:23,265 --> 00:02:26,664
They've found out that we failed to open the e-mail.

17
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:27,764
Yes.

18
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:30,864
Hey, answer me.

19
00:02:30,865 --> 00:02:34,164
I know you're at that villa.

20
00:02:34,165 --> 00:02:35,765
Shinichi?

21
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:39,164
Hurry up and answer me,

22
00:02:39,165 --> 00:02:40,565
Mr. Itakura.

23
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:42,565
Hey!

24
00:02:47,365 --> 00:02:53,065
"Contact with the Black Organization (Pursuit Edition)"

25
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:57,764
Hey, answer me.

26
00:02:57,765 --> 00:03:01,064
I know you're at that villa.

27
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:02,964
Hurry up and answer me,

28
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:04,765
Mr. Itakura.

29
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:09,364
I guess we've no choice

30
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:11,264
but to make it out the back door

31
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:13,565
and hide in the blizzard.

32
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:18,564
Oh, sorry. It's so dark in here

33
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,365
that I was having trouble picking up the phone.

34
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:24,864
It seems that the electrical circuit went out

35
00:03:24,865 --> 00:03:26,564
because of this blizzard,

36
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:30,464
I couldn't open the mail because of this, too.

37
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:32,264
That's what you get for trying to receive mail

38
00:03:32,265 --> 00:03:34,464
in a mountain villa like that.

39
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,064
Hey, wait a minute.

40
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:40,164
How come your answer phone's working despite the blackout?

41
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:44,464
Well, blackouts are frequent in this area because it snows a lot.

42
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:48,065
That's why I'm using a phone equipped with a built-in battery.

43
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:51,365
I see.

44
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:57,665
It's amazing how you found out I was here.

45
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:03,965
"Please turn on the light" -We know all about you.

46
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:08,964
Don't tell me you were keeping watch over this villa, were you?

47
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:11,664
We weren't, don't worry.

48
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:13,064
Just as promised,

49
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:15,864
we're nowhere near you.

50
00:04:15,865 --> 00:04:20,664
You're finished with that system software in question, I hope.

51
00:04:20,665 --> 00:04:22,665
Yes, somehow.

52
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:26,064
Is there anyone with you?

53
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,564
Hey, answer me!

54
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:29,464
What is that sound just now?

55
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:31,364
Sound?

56
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:33,664
It's the wind.

57
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:36,165
The sound of the wind tapping on the window.

58
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:39,764
That's right, it's snowing heavily over there, too.

59
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:43,064
So, I can't use the computer.

60
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:46,164
I hate to say this, but would you give me the info directly?

61
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:49,165
The time and place of where I should hand this software over to you.

62
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:52,164
All right, fine.

63
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:55,264
I'll say it just once, so listen well.

64
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:58,964
You know the station that's under construction called "Kenbashi"?

65
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,664
The fashionable station that's going to be added to the Toto Subway Line.

66
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:04,764
Tomorrow morning at midnight,

67
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:06,664
come and wait in front of coin locker number 0032

68
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:10,164
located on the basement floor of the station.

69
00:05:10,165 --> 00:05:14,165
Don't forget to bring the system software, got that?

70
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:18,064
No. Tomorrow's a bad day.

71
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:19,664
What?

72
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:23,564
I'm going to have to be hospitalized from this evening for a health check.

73
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:25,064
You know about it, don't you?

74
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:27,764
About my bad heart condition.

75
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:31,464
Don't tell me that you're trying to buy time

76
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,264
because you still haven't completed that software?

77
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:36,364
No, of course not.

78
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:38,764
The software is complete.

79
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:40,764
Then, when is it convenient for you?

80
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:42,364
After I'm discharged from the hospital,

81
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:43,964
so about three to four days later.

82
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:46,664
No, give me five days.

83
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:50,064
Nonsense. We can't wait that long.

84
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:51,964
Postpone your hospitalization appointment.

85
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:55,564
I finally got an appointment with a famous heart surgeon,

86
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:57,564
so I can't change the date.

87
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,264
If I were to hand it over to you before I enter the hospital,

88
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:04,064
it has to be today, but the construction workers will be there at daybreak.

89
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:07,764
It's not convenient for you guys then, isn't it?

90
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:09,564
At 4 am, then.

91
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:12,664
Four hours from now at 4 am.

92
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,964
Bring the software to the place I told you.

93
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:17,064
Four hours from now?

94
00:06:17,065 --> 00:06:19,564
From Gunma to Tokyo?

95
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:20,764
What's the problem?

96
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:21,765
If it's completed,

97
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:24,164
you should be able to bring it with you, shouldn't you?

98
00:06:24,165 --> 00:06:25,764
Okay.

99
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:28,565
Four hours from now, I'll take it there.

100
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:32,964
But don't ambush me.

101
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:37,464
If I spot any of your people, this entire deal is off.

102
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:40,064
Even if you were to force this software away from me,

103
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:41,464
keep in mind that doing so may throw the method

104
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:44,765
of using this software into the pits of darkness forever.

105
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:49,764
You're sure a cautious fellow, just like rumor has it.

106
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:51,464
Okay. Four hours from now,

107
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:53,364
in front of locker number 0032

108
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:55,764
at the basement of Kenbashi Station.

109
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:58,765
-Don't be late. -Yes.

110
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:04,964
All right, I got them.

111
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:06,764
Hey, just what do you intend to do?

112
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:08,864
Don't tell me that you're going to listen to them

113
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:11,664
and take that software over?

114
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,964
I'm not listening to them.

115
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:16,764
I lead the conversation so that the handover time of the software

116
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:19,164
would be rushed to 4 this morning,

117
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:21,464
by sounding flustered.

118
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:23,564
What?

119
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:26,764
The news of Mr. Itakura's death

120
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:28,764
may be aired when morning comes, right?

121
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:30,664
If they find out,

122
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:33,864
this deal as well as clues about them will go down the drain.

123
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:35,664
Now, the jewelry robber who is at large...

124
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:37,164
Fortunately, it seems

125
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,864
that none of the news stations are covering news about his case yet.

126
00:07:39,865 --> 00:07:42,664
Which means this is what you intended to do, to begin with?

127
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:45,964
Yes, I was planning to tell them

128
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,264
to rush the hand over time to an earlier time

129
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:50,564
when I receive the e-mail from them.

130
00:07:50,565 --> 00:07:54,864
So, let's erase all traces of us having been here

131
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:57,964
and get out of here with your beetle.

132
00:07:57,965 --> 00:07:59,864
Out of here?

133
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:04,264
They may be watching us from somewhere around this villa, right?

134
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:06,864
If we carelessly go out just like that to the car that's parked outside,

135
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:09,964
they may spot us.

136
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:11,664
Don't worry.

137
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:15,064
If Vodka or any of his people were around,

138
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:16,764
they would've easily seen through my lie

139
00:08:16,765 --> 00:08:18,064
that I couldn't use the computer

140
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,664
because the circuit was cut off by the blizzard.

141
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:22,564
I see.

142
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:25,664
That's why you asked me to turn on the lights to this villa?

143
00:08:25,665 --> 00:08:26,864
Yes.

144
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:30,164
We know at the least that none of his people is at a distance

145
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:33,564
where they can see the lights of the villa.

146
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:36,264
They probably tracked this place,

147
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,064
using some alarm system that would warn them

148
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:41,164
and specify the computer of the one they're sending the mail to,

149
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:42,864
just in case the mail that they sent

150
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:45,364
isn't opened by the receiver of the mail.

151
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:48,564
Either way, part of the members of the group will be arrested.

152
00:08:48,565 --> 00:08:51,064
I'll confirm the contents of this software

153
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:53,964
with the laptop computer in the beetle,

154
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:56,364
and if it's some outrageous software

155
00:08:56,365 --> 00:08:58,964
that could be used for a hideous crime or something.

156
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:00,664
You're going to report it to the police,

157
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,564
and specify the place of the deal,

158
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:07,264
so they can ambush the culprits and arrest whoever shows up, right?

159
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:08,665
Yes.

160
00:09:11,665 --> 00:09:13,664
Darn. No good.

161
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:17,064
We need to enter a password for this software, too.

162
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:18,464
Just like the e-mail,

163
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:22,964
a password is been set between Mr. Itakura and those guys.

164
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:25,564
Then, just make a copy of it for now.

165
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,064
I can't do that either.

166
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:30,264
It's protected with a copy guard.

167
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:33,064
Under this condition, the police won't move.

168
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:37,364
Aren't they always secretly armed with guns?

169
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:40,064
If you report that there will be a deal involving guns,

170
00:09:40,065 --> 00:09:42,364
maybe at least two or three officers will come.

171
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:45,564
We don't even know how many those guys have on their side.

172
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:46,764
So, with only a small number on our side,

173
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:49,264
we're more likely to be biting off our heads.

174
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:51,364
Unless we find out what their purpose is,

175
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:53,864
and present evidence to the police as to how dangerous they are,

176
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:55,664
as well as how large their organization is,

177
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:58,564
and have the police come equipped with sufficient men,

178
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,265
it'll be difficult to lay our hands on them.

179
00:10:02,265 --> 00:10:04,264
How frustrating.

180
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:05,964
We know that they're coming

181
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:07,664
and yet we can't do a thing about it.

182
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:10,265
Not really. There's still one way.

183
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:14,264
It's a bit dangerous, though.

184
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:17,665
Hey, don't tell me that you're planning to meet them directly?

185
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:21,064
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

186
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:22,664
Don't tell me that...

187
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,465
Yes, you're most probably right.

188
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:30,264
It's a flat after all.

189
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:33,164
We've got to call a nearby service station

190
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:36,364
and have them bring us over a spare tire.

191
00:10:36,365 --> 00:10:37,964
Is it going to work?

192
00:10:37,965 --> 00:10:39,664
I don't think there's any service station

193
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:41,665
that'll come at this time of night.

194
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:45,364
Well, we may as well relax and wait in the car then.

195
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:49,364
We won't make it in time for meeting those guys if we do that!

196
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:51,564
I'm sure that this is God's way of telling you

197
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:54,365
to keep from taking dangerous action, Shinichi.

198
00:10:55,665 --> 00:10:57,665
Darn.

199
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:02,365
A car?

200
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:06,565
Hey!

201
00:11:10,465 --> 00:11:12,064
What's up?

202
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:15,864
Oh, well. We got a flat.

203
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:18,464
We want to go back to Tokyo,

204
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:20,264
but won't you give us a lift?

205
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:21,764
Tokyo?

206
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,064
What do you say?

207
00:11:24,065 --> 00:11:27,264
Why not? We're going in that direction anyway.

208
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:29,964
Gramps, are you familiar with the roads around here?

209
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,764
Well, yes, sort of.

210
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:33,564
Okay, you get in the front seat, gramps.

211
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:35,364
And the kid in the backseat.

212
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:37,165
Thanks.

213
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:47,364
I'm sorry to intrude on you when you were sleeping, miss.

214
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:51,165
It's okay, I was just kind of dozing.

215
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:03,464
Cool! This is a foreign car, isn't it?

216
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:05,864
Is this car yours, sir?

217
00:12:05,865 --> 00:12:08,064
Yes, I've gotten tired of it

218
00:12:08,065 --> 00:12:11,064
and was just thinking of getting myself another car, though.

219
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:13,964
You must be rich,

220
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:16,364
because this car is really expensive.

221
00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:17,764
Sort of.

222
00:12:17,765 --> 00:12:19,264
Although he may not look it,

223
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:21,665
he's the heir to a big company, you know.

224
00:12:27,365 --> 00:12:28,765
Goodness!

225
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:37,064
That sure was close.

226
00:12:37,065 --> 00:12:39,564
Snowy roads are dangerous after all.

227
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:42,665
Well, let's not rush and drive safely.

228
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:49,364
Hey, didn't you hear something funny just now?

229
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:52,764
Really? I didn't hear anything.

230
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:56,264
The stuff that we have in the trunk probably moved.

231
00:12:56,265 --> 00:12:58,464
It's nothing to sweat about.

232
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:00,964
Hey, don't smoke!

233
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:04,564
Did you forget that I hate cigarettes?

234
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:08,264
Oh, sorry. That's right.

235
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:11,764
Oh, to go to Tokyo turn left there.

236
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:13,364
All right.

237
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:14,564
It's stopped snowing

238
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:17,065
so I guess we can get there before 3 am.

239
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:23,564
But why were you guys in Gunma?

240
00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:25,964
Were you skiing with your grandson?

241
00:13:25,965 --> 00:13:28,064
I guess you could say so.

242
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:29,465
Sounds great.

243
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:41,064
Hey. Watch where you're going.

244
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:42,564
Sorry, sorry.

245
00:13:42,565 --> 00:13:45,565
I shouldn't have driven in the snow after all.

246
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:55,365
Strange.

247
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:58,665
There's something fishy about them.

248
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:00,865
Don't tell me that...

249
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:04,565
Don't tell me that they're...

250
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,339
What's with you anyway?

251
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,139
How many times do you think you got honked at already?

252
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,040
Didn't I tell you that I'm not good at driving on snowy roads?

253
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,439
You're right! This car needs a tune-up

254
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,639
and hasn't got its safety check yet,

255
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,740
so you've got to drive more carefully!

256
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,339
You're going to get a safety check for this car soon, aren't you?

257
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,640
Yes, I guess so.

258
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,039
You don't remember?

259
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,640
The number 2 is written on the sticker on the windshield.

260
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,839
That's the inspection certificate

261
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,339
and depending on the number and the color of the sticker.

262
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,340
It tells you

263
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:01,940
when you're supposed to be getting your next safety check, right?

264
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,239
The color is this year's color,

265
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,239
so it's obvious that you have to get your safety check

266
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,139
by February this year.

267
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,439
Oh, that's right. I remember now.

268
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,739
Come to think of it, I got a postcard saying

269
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,839
for me to go get my safety check within this month.

270
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,839
But, sonny, when did you see it?

271
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,339
The sticker was covered with snow.

272
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,939
See. I saw it when the on-coming car passed us.

273
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,139
When the headlights shined on it,

274
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,740
the number outside could be seen transparent from the back.

275
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,839
Oh, I see! I thought it was "2"

276
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,339
because I saw it transparent from behind but it was actually "5"!

277
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,939
But, that's strange.

278
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,939
You got a postcard saying that you

279
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,539
had to go get a safety check within the month of February, right?

280
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,239
I wonder why?

281
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,539
Oh, well, you see... That's...

282
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,939
Didn't I just tell you a while ago,

283
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,339
that he's a Richie Rich, sonny?

284
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,039
That's why he leaves all the details up to others to do it for him.

285
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,839
He answered you casually but the thing is,

286
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,740
he's not even bothered about the date of the safety check.

287
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,039
You've got to turn right over there,

288
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,440
or we won't make it to Tokyo.

289
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,639
Gosh. The kid keeps blabbing on, so...

290
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,639
I'm sorry, he's such a curious child.

291
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,439
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

292
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,840
Okay, there.

293
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,939
By the way,

294
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,139
what are you listening to, sonny?

295
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,639
Oh, this?

296
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,339
I'm listening to the news.

297
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,639
News?

298
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,639
Yes. There are all kinds of news.

299
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:51,239
About economy picking up and the new coach of Big Osaka.

300
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,039
Or about the jewelry robber who is on the run.

301
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,839
You're still so little, yet you like news.

302
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,539
Yes.

303
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,639
And? Was the robber caught?

304
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,139
No.

305
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,239
They're still escaping somewhere in the Gunma area.

306
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,439
But I'm sure they'll be arrested soon.

307
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
Because... Look.

308
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:13,839
They seem to have checkpoints here there

309
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,040
and everywhere like over there.

310
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,639
License, please.

311
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,940
Yes.

312
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,339
Excuse me, but where did you come from?

313
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,340
Well...

314
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,040
Officer Yamamura!

315
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,339
You're... you're Conan if I remember correctly.

316
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,139
Officer Yamamura, this is a checkpoint

317
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,639
to arrest the jewelry shop robbers, right?

318
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,239
Yes.

319
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,939
There are a group of three wearing baseball caps.

320
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,640
After robbing a jewelry shop in Gunma,

321
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,039
they abandoned the car they made their getaway with in the mountains

322
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,040
and vanished.

323
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,839
But one of the three is hurt,

324
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,839
so I don't think they got too far away yet.

325
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,239
Hurt?

326
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,639
Right.

327
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,139
When we got the report,

328
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,039
I just happened to be nearby doing some questioning.

329
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,139
When I got to the scene of the crime,

330
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,239
I happened to run into the robbers

331
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,739
who fled out of the shop.

332
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,539
So I pulled out my gun and said,

333
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,439
"Freeze. Freeze or I'll shoot".

334
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,639
Cool!

335
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,539
But the robbers refused to stop

336
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,739
so I fired a warning shot towards them.

337
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,740
Hey.

338
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,640
And, I hit one of the robbers in the thigh!

339
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,339
Well, anyway,

340
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,039
either they had another car stashed away in the mountains beforehand,

341
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,539
or they stole a car that coincidentally passed through

342
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,139
and are on the run.

343
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,639
Didn't you see some suspicious-looking people?

344
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,639
Yes, I did.

345
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,340
You mean people who are riding in a car that is not theirs, right?

346
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,240
That's us!

347
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,639
My car tire went flat in the mountains,

348
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,839
so we had them give us a lift.

349
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,539
Right.

350
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,739
Dr. Agasa, where is your car, then?

351
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,739
I called the car dealer

352
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,639
and they said they'd come get it in the morning,

353
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,739
so I left it in the mountains with the key inside.

354
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,540
Then, isn't your car in trouble?

355
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,639
Maybe the robbers got a hold of it

356
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,639
and are riding it around.

357
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,239
That's possible.

358
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,539
Then, maybe you shouldn't be bothering with us

359
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,839
and keeping watch over that car.

360
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,039
It's a yellow beetle, so it's easy to spot.

361
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,139
How strange. Your voices sound familiar.

362
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,339
I don't think so.

363
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,740
So, may we go now, officer?

364
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:07,239
Will you take that jacket you have over your lap, just in case?

365
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,739
Hey! Don't tell me you suspect us?

366
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,139
See, I haven't been shot or anything!

367
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,039
I guess not.

368
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,840
Be careful, then.

369
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,940
Hello? This is the Agasa residence.

370
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,139
The Gunma Prefectural police?

371
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,939
According to Dr. Agasa, he said that the dealers

372
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,439
would be picking his car up in the morning.

373
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,939
But, leaving the car as is in the mountains

374
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,439
may give the robbers a chance to use it,

375
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,739
so we have decided to tow it away for now.

376
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:59,539
So, please tell him to come and pick his car up at the station.

377
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,639
Yes, I will.

378
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,839
Goodbye, then.

379
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,140
Thank you.

380
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,540
I wonder what they're doing in Gunma at this time of day?

381
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,539
I'll bet he was talked into by Shinichi again

382
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,540
and went sticking their noses into a criminal case or something.

383
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,039
Seriously.

384
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,139
I don't see what thrill they find in

385
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,839
looking for faults in others at the cost of losing sleep.

386
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,840
I see no fun at all in playing detective.

387
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,340
A spare pair of pursuit glasses.

388
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,539
Yes, we're going to pick up the stuff earlier than scheduled.

389
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,339
An hour from now, at 4 am.

390
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,939
The place remains unchanged.

391
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,039
It's in front of the locker in the basement of Kenbashi Subway Station.

392
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,940
Tell Gin about this too, will you?

393
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,540
Yes, of course.

394
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,739
Get the men ready armed with guns.

395
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,739
He could've gone chicken and called the cops.

396
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,239
Either way, after the deal, it's good riddance with him anyway.

397
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,639
We were planning to get rid of him

398
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,440
inside Kenbashi Station to begin with.

399
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,239
"Next Episode" -It's almost time.

400
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Is everyone in position?

401
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,340
Don't let one mouse get through.

402
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,839
Which means...

403
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,740
Yes. He should still be hiding somewhere nearby.

404
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,039
