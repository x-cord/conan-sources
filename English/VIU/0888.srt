1
00:00:00,914 --> 00:00:04,713
Inside "Mokujin", a trick box made by Kichiemon Samizu,

2
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:10,614
is the big jewel and Thief Kid's target "Luna Memoria".

3
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:14,913
And the instructions to open the box

4
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,113
can be found in one of ten thousand books

5
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:20,014
donated to the Suzuki Library.

6
00:00:21,114 --> 00:00:23,214
It's worth finding, don't you think?

7
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:26,214
This is way too many.

8
00:00:27,214 --> 00:00:31,713
Is it possible your husband hid the page somewhere else?

9
00:00:31,714 --> 00:00:33,513
No.

10
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:36,313
My husband died last month

11
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:38,713
in an unfortunate traffic accident.

12
00:00:38,714 --> 00:00:43,213
He couldn't have foreseen that and hidden the page elsewhere.

13
00:00:43,214 --> 00:00:48,713
Then maybe it's in a book you wouldn't normally read.

14
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:50,713
You're right.

15
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:53,613
I tend not to read

16
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:59,813
murder mysteries or monster stories.

17
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:03,813
Huh? Sonoko, did you put on some makeup?

18
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,313
While we were in the bathroom.

19
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:08,613
After all, Thief Kid is coming.

20
00:01:08,614 --> 00:01:10,913
I need to dress up for him.

21
00:01:10,914 --> 00:01:12,913
Even if he does come,

22
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:16,313
the anti-theft mechanisms and trick box

23
00:01:16,314 --> 00:01:19,713
will probably prevent him from taking the moonstone.

24
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:22,514
Not even that pretentious thief could manage that.

25
00:01:25,614 --> 00:01:27,614
I wouldn't be so sure.

26
00:01:28,814 --> 00:01:30,813
This presence...

27
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:32,013
It's him.

28
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:33,714
He's nearby.

29
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:42,413
Who?

30
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:44,014
Who is he disguised as?

31
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,013
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

32
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:50,013
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

33
00:01:50,014 --> 00:01:52,013
I'll see through the disguise of the thief

34
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:54,213
coming after the trick box full of memories!

35
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,813
He sees through the one and only truth.

36
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:57,913
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

37
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:00,414
His name is Detective Conan!

38
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:45,979
"Thief Kid and the Trick Box (Part 2)"

39
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:48,979
"Suzuki Library"

40
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,978
Pops hasn't been coughing

41
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,879
since he came back from the bathroom.

42
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:05,779
Akai seems more interested in his surroundings than his book.

43
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:12,479
Dr. Agasa spent too long in the bathroom.

44
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:16,678
The only ones who aren't suspicious

45
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:19,579
are Jirokichi and the old woman.

46
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:23,478
With the remote for the security devices,

47
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,778
he'd have plenty of opportunities to swap out the box.

48
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:30,779
And Thief Kid wouldn't get so upset over the box getting wet.

49
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:34,379
What about Ran and Sonoko?

50
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,679
Thief Kid's disguised himself as them before, hasn't he?

51
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:44,478
What's wrong?

52
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,478
There's a book up there that I'm interested in,

53
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,379
but I can't reach it.

54
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:55,178
I could probably get it if I used a ladder,

55
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:57,978
but they're both being used.

56
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:01,778
I'll hold your chair for you.

57
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,178
Thank you.

58
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,778
I'll use their heights to identify them.

59
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:09,779
Since they're both about as tall as the Dr. Agasa...

60
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:20,679
I can almost see her underwear.

61
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,978
No, wait.

62
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:26,978
It could be Thief Kid disguised as her.

63
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:30,978
But these thighs are definitely...

64
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:33,079
What a nice view.

65
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,478
No...

66
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,678
You may look like a child,

67
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:41,378
but you're a dirty old man on the inside.

68
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,878
Pervert.

69
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,278
It's no use. I can't reach it.

70
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,578
I was just observing her

71
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,778
to see if it was Thief Kid in disguise.

72
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:50,178
So you're a huge pervert.

73
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:52,379
Yeah, sorry! I'm such a pervert!

74
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:57,078
Anyway, can't you sense his presence, too?

75
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:00,478
Who knows? I don't feel anything.

76
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,978
Aside from him, couldn't he be anybody?

77
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,979
He's the only one who's been in this room the whole time.

78
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:11,378
No.

79
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:14,478
It's possible he's been disguised as Subaru Okiya all along

80
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,278
and snuck in that way.

81
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,078
Darn it.

82
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,679
Everyone's starting to look suspicious.

83
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:27,778
Here. Isn't this the book you wanted?

84
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:29,279
Thanks!

85
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,078
What's this?

86
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:36,579
"13 Conditions For Dating a Detective"?

87
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,678
Don't look!

88
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:44,978
I'm not sure if it will help,

89
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:47,478
but embarrassingly enough,

90
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:52,278
my husband and I kept an exchange diary when we were students.

91
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,478
"Exchange Diary" -It was a very strange diary.

92
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,378
Strange how?

93
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:00,478
We agreed that my husband would write on the left,

94
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,778
and I would write on the right.

95
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:10,078
But I couldn't fit all the day's events

96
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,879
or how I felt about my husband on a single page.

97
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:16,378
So I'd fill three whole pages

98
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:20,278
so my husband could write on the left.

99
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,279
But my husband only ever wrote a few sentences.

100
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,978
Maybe he just wasn't much of a writer.

101
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:32,379
Yes. That's what I though at the time.

102
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:35,678
But just after we got married,

103
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:40,779
I found the exchange diary on my husband's desk.

104
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:45,978
As I was reading the awkward writing of my younger self

105
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:49,478
with feelings of embarrassment and nostalgia,

106
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,278
I suddenly came across two full pages

107
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,278
of my husband's writing

108
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:01,278
that I didn't recognize

109
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,979
from our days as students.

110
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:11,579
My husband took it from me immediately after that.

111
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:19,179
You can't read that. It's secret.

112
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:25,278
I haven't seen the exchange diary since.

113
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,178
I wonder what that was.

114
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:32,478
Perhaps it's related to the piece of paper we can't find.

115
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,978
Maybe the pages were glued together.

116
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,078
Your husband may have been eating rice balls while reading that page.

117
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:42,379
A grain of rice could've fallen between the pages.

118
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,679
My husband was a very shy man.

119
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:53,479
I had his mother teach me.

120
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:57,179
If any water got inside...

121
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:01,379
It was a very strange diary.

122
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:05,178
If you're able to find that paper,

123
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:08,779
you should be able to find the true contents of the box.

124
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,879
That face.

125
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:22,979
Looks like you've figured it out, too, Detective.

126
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:25,578
Both where that paper is

127
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:28,279
and the true contents of the box.

128
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:35,605
What?

129
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:37,805
You figured out where the written instructions

130
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:40,105
to open the box are?

131
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:41,205
Yeah.

132
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:47,405
And why we haven't been able to find it.

133
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:49,505
Conan, what do you mean?

134
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:53,205
You're not just making things up, are you?

135
00:09:53,206 --> 00:09:56,106
Could I borrow a notebook and pen?

136
00:09:58,406 --> 00:10:00,105
Will these work?

137
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:01,505
Thanks.

138
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:05,106
First, we'll tear out a single page.

139
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,406
And tear that page in half again.

140
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:15,405
On the front and back of the torn page,

141
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,406
we'll draw a circle.

142
00:10:18,806 --> 00:10:22,305
There. Now, study it carefully and remember what it looks like.

143
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:24,006
Okay.

144
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:28,005
It's just a circle, right?

145
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:29,205
Once you've memorized it,

146
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:32,105
can you put it back inside the notebook?

147
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:33,705
Here.

148
00:10:33,706 --> 00:10:34,906
Thanks.

149
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:38,605
Abracadabra.

150
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:41,105
I command this paper to disappear!

151
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:43,605
Here.

152
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:45,605
Now you can't find it.

153
00:10:45,606 --> 00:10:48,305
Don't be ridiculous!

154
00:10:48,306 --> 00:10:50,806
By flipping through it, it should instantly...

155
00:10:52,306 --> 00:10:53,405
What?

156
00:10:53,406 --> 00:10:55,205
This can't be possible.

157
00:10:55,206 --> 00:10:56,906
It must be in here somewhere.

158
00:10:57,906 --> 00:11:00,605
-What? -It disappeared?

159
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:02,505
Wow!

160
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:06,405
You didn't secretly take it out, did you?

161
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:08,705
I wouldn't do that.

162
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:10,306
After all...

163
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:14,806
See? It's still in here.

164
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:17,805
No way!

165
00:11:17,806 --> 00:11:19,505
How?

166
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:22,805
The trick is in the edge of the page.

167
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:25,605
See how the bottom edge of the page

168
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:27,406
is slightly torn where the paper is?

169
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:32,005
Let me see that.

170
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:34,805
That makes it so it doesn't get caught on your finger

171
00:11:34,806 --> 00:11:38,605
when you flip through it so you skip over that page.

172
00:11:38,606 --> 00:11:40,405
You're right.

173
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:43,305
If you flip through the pages while holding them from the top,

174
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:45,905
you'll find the paper.

175
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,105
You're right.

176
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,305
It's like a magic trick.

177
00:11:49,306 --> 00:11:51,705
I tore the edge of the page

178
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:54,805
while you were all looking at the paper.

179
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:57,205
The old woman's husband probably used

180
00:11:57,206 --> 00:12:01,105
the same trick in the exchange diary she mentioned.

181
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:04,505
Her husband was a shy man,

182
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:06,405
so he made it

183
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:10,605
so the pages he wrote on would be skipped over.

184
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:13,005
The old woman was able to find them

185
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:15,405
because she was carefully turning each page

186
00:12:15,406 --> 00:12:18,105
while reading the sections she wrote.

187
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:20,605
But, boy,

188
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:26,005
unless we know which of these ten thousand books uses the same trick...

189
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:28,405
-I figured that out, too. -What?

190
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:31,105
Even if you make the instructions hard to find,

191
00:12:31,106 --> 00:12:33,005
you'd eventually find them

192
00:12:33,006 --> 00:12:36,205
if you turned each page like the old woman did.

193
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:37,405
Yes.

194
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:42,505
But your husband said you'd never find them, right?

195
00:12:42,506 --> 00:12:43,905
What? Yes.

196
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:49,205
So it's between some pages you'd never turn.

197
00:12:49,206 --> 00:12:54,305
But Subaru and Ai examined the mystery novels

198
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,805
and monster stories the old woman didn't like, right?

199
00:12:57,806 --> 00:13:01,605
The old woman already searched those.

200
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:05,005
She doesn't have to read them to look for the paper.

201
00:13:05,006 --> 00:13:06,805
Then which book is it?

202
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:09,505
Quit putting on airs and tell us!

203
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:13,805
It's a book with pages she'd never need to turn.

204
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:17,305
There was no point in her reading them

205
00:13:17,306 --> 00:13:19,305
because she'd learned something even better

206
00:13:19,306 --> 00:13:22,905
than what was written on those pages.

207
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:24,506
It's the...

208
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,405
meat and potatoes recipe in a cookbook, isn't it?

209
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:30,305
Correct!

210
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:31,705
I see.

211
00:13:31,706 --> 00:13:34,805
She learned the recipe from her mother-in-law.

212
00:13:34,806 --> 00:13:38,805
Since her husband loved those flavors,

213
00:13:38,806 --> 00:13:41,405
there was no need for her to read it.

214
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:43,705
And if it were between the pages of any other recipe,

215
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:46,905
even if he used the trick you described earlier,

216
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:51,606
she would've found it by searching the pages written in the index.

217
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:54,805
Where are the cookbooks?

218
00:13:54,806 --> 00:13:59,705
I believe they're over on that shelf.

219
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,806
But there are dozens of cookbooks.

220
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:07,005
A few dozen out of ten thousand.

221
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:10,305
And we're only searching the meat and potato recipes.

222
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:13,006
If we all search for it, it should take only a few minutes.

223
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:17,405
What?

224
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:19,305
A blackout?

225
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:22,206
It's Thief Kid! Thief Kid is here!

226
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:28,405
The lights went out.

227
00:14:28,406 --> 00:14:30,405
Inspector, should we go in?

228
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:31,905
Don't panic!

229
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:35,505
We agreed not to enter this time until we've received the signal.

230
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:38,305
So keep all the exits covered instead.

231
00:14:38,306 --> 00:14:40,405
Don't let a single ant out!

232
00:14:40,406 --> 00:14:41,406
Yes, sir...

233
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:45,505
Gosh. You let Thief Kid mess with the wiring

234
00:14:45,506 --> 00:14:48,105
because you wouldn't let the cops in.

235
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:50,905
Don't worry.

236
00:14:50,906 --> 00:14:52,705
Even if he does come,

237
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:57,206
he won't be able to open the trick box in the darkness.

238
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:00,705
A music box.

239
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:04,505
Isn't this "My Grandfather's Clock"?

240
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:07,906
Didn't she say the box plays music when it's opened?

241
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:13,905
That was the sound of the cage falling!

242
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:15,305
What are you doing?

243
00:15:15,306 --> 00:15:18,105
Get those lights back on!

244
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:19,506
Hey, what's going on?

245
00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:23,805
Is the trick box safe?

246
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:26,605
He didn't take it.

247
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:27,906
What?

248
00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:31,605
"I've taken the contents of the box. Thief Kid"

249
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:34,405
"I've taken the contents of the box."

250
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:35,805
"Thief Kid."

251
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:37,905
That's impossible!

252
00:15:37,906 --> 00:15:41,605
Are you saying he opened Kichiemon Samizu's trick box

253
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:46,205
in the darkness in such a short amount of time?

254
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:48,205
I knew he could do it!

255
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:50,205
He got us this time.

256
00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:53,905
Looks like we're not needed anymore.

257
00:15:53,906 --> 00:15:56,105
Can we leave now?

258
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:58,105
-No! -What?

259
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:02,105
The security shutters linked to the cage are closed.

260
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:04,605
He should still be inside.

261
00:16:04,606 --> 00:16:10,105
I'll find him, even if it means pulling the faces of everyone in here.

262
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:12,805
Please don't.

263
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,905
Remember what I said?

264
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:18,305
I'd allow you to display the trick box here on the condition

265
00:16:18,306 --> 00:16:21,005
that you not to do anything boorish

266
00:16:21,006 --> 00:16:24,105
to the guests at the library.

267
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:26,005
But, madam,

268
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:30,005
the moonstone your husband left you...

269
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:32,405
He can have the moonstone

270
00:16:32,406 --> 00:16:37,205
for opening the box.

271
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,206
"Japanese Cooking"

272
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:42,705
What I really wanted

273
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:46,605
was the other thing inside the box.

274
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,805
While searching the books according to what that boy said,

275
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:53,505
I found the piece of paper in this cookbook.

276
00:16:53,506 --> 00:16:56,406
Let us open the box and see what's inside.

277
00:17:00,806 --> 00:17:06,006
But he may have taken the other object.

278
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:08,505
Don't worry.

279
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:11,405
I'm the only one left in this world

280
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:14,506
who sees any value in it.

281
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:20,905
It hurts...

282
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,505
What's wrong, Dr. Agasa?

283
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:24,705
It's my stomach again.

284
00:17:24,706 --> 00:17:28,605
Then go to the bathroom.

285
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:30,006
I will.

286
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:37,806
Hey.

287
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:41,805
You still haven't opened the box, have you?

288
00:17:41,806 --> 00:17:46,105
What? Conan, I'm using the toilet.

289
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,805
Using the toilet?

290
00:17:47,806 --> 00:17:49,906
You haven't taken off your pants.

291
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:54,805
Well, I was just about to do my business.

292
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:57,905
Anyway, Dr. Agasa doesn't call me "Conan"

293
00:17:57,906 --> 00:18:00,705
when we're alone together.

294
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,405
Oh, no!

295
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:04,006
Those band-aids on your right hand...

296
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:09,805
Dr. Agasa had one on the second joint of his pointer finger,

297
00:18:09,806 --> 00:18:11,506
not the tip.

298
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:17,605
Besides, Dr. Agasa is as tall as Ran.

299
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:23,205
How did you easily pick out the book that Ran couldn't reach

300
00:18:23,206 --> 00:18:26,705
while standing on her tip toes on top of a chair?

301
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:30,805
Probably because you were using the thickness of Dr. Agasa's legs

302
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:34,305
to bend your knees and make yourself look shorter,

303
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:37,706
but straightened them to get the book.

304
00:18:38,906 --> 00:18:40,806
Right?

305
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,405
Thief Kid.

306
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:50,205
How did you know I hadn't opened the box yet?

307
00:18:50,206 --> 00:18:52,005
The American Henry Work wrote

308
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:57,305
"My Grandfather's Clock" in 1876.

309
00:18:57,306 --> 00:19:01,205
But it didn't get to Japan until 1940.

310
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,505
A mid-19th Century tinkerer wouldn't have known the song.

311
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:07,605
You played it on your phone, didn't you?

312
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:10,306
Correct!

313
00:19:11,506 --> 00:19:15,805
Are you sure you don't need to check out that moonstone?

314
00:19:15,806 --> 00:19:19,306
I thought you were looking for a special jewel.

315
00:19:20,906 --> 00:19:24,405
Actually, I once stole that moonstone back

316
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:29,506
after a thief stole it from that woman's husband.

317
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:34,306
Watch where you're going!

318
00:19:39,606 --> 00:19:40,606
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:41,506 --> 00:19:44,205
Isn't this yours?

320
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:47,105
Yes, but why?

321
00:19:47,106 --> 00:19:49,806
Be careful. You were just pickpocketed.

322
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:55,805
This moonstone looks expensive.

323
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:58,305
Is it a gift?

324
00:19:58,306 --> 00:20:01,405
Yes, for my wife.

325
00:20:01,406 --> 00:20:03,206
You could say it's her reward.

326
00:20:05,106 --> 00:20:09,105
I want to keep it next to our diary.

327
00:20:09,106 --> 00:20:13,705
After all, moonstones are a symbol of pure love.

328
00:20:13,706 --> 00:20:15,906
"Congratulations! You finally found it!"

329
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:28,006
So, it's just the exchange diary.

330
00:20:29,206 --> 00:20:30,805
I see.

331
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:33,105
So you've already checked it out.

332
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:37,805
I only came here to accept his challenge.

333
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:41,306
I'll be leaving now.

334
00:20:42,506 --> 00:20:44,205
It's strange. It won't open.

335
00:20:44,206 --> 00:20:46,805
Before you leave,

336
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:49,705
I'd like you to return those photos you took of me.

337
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,006
I can't let those get out.

338
00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:58,006
Come to think of it, he had some kind of device on his neck.

339
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:02,006
Another blackout?

340
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:07,706
Darn it. He left his phone and ran.

341
00:22:32,006 --> 00:22:34,505
"Mouri Detective Agency"

342
00:22:34,506 --> 00:22:36,605
"General Advisor Jirokichi Suzuki (72)"

343
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,706
"Yoko Okino Live Project, 'Hashage Live'"

344
00:22:49,506 --> 00:22:51,806
Thanks for the food...

345
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:59,006
-It's good! -It's good!

346
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:04,005
This is...

347
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:05,506
pretty good.

348
00:23:07,306 --> 00:23:10,705
The Suzuki Library is still closed

349
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:15,305
as the search for Thief Kid enters its twelfth hour.

350
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:17,905
As opening time nears,

351
00:23:17,906 --> 00:23:21,705
the search team appears increasingly exhausted.

352
00:23:21,706 --> 00:23:25,306
They're hoping to arrest Thief Kid as soon as possible.

353
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,005
Inspector Nakamori.

354
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:31,205
There's nowhere else left to search.

355
00:23:31,206 --> 00:23:33,905
Perhaps he's already escaped.

356
00:23:33,906 --> 00:23:35,605
That's impossible.

357
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:37,105
Find him!

358
00:23:37,106 --> 00:23:40,006
Just give up already.

359
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,605
"Next Episode" -This is Ms. Wakasa.

360
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:47,905
She'll be my assistant homeroom teacher starting today.

361
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:49,805
Nice...

362
00:23:49,806 --> 00:23:51,605
Nice to meet you!

363
00:23:51,606 --> 00:23:55,405
You don't usually have assistants start this late in the year.

364
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:58,106
Sorry for making you help me during your lunch break.

365
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:01,206
It really is in shambles!

366
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:06,006
Don't touch that.
