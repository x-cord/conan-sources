1
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:06,304
Spring, the season when new things begin.

2
00:00:06,754 --> 00:00:13,014
This is the story of a group of new police recruits who joined the academy in the spring.

3
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:19,064
Several Years Earlier

4
00:00:43,664 --> 00:00:47,173
I'm surprised you're still standing after taking my punches.

5
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:49,383
Furuya Rei (22) I'm surprised you're still standing after taking my punches.

6
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:50,014
Furuya Rei (22)

7
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:53,714
Matsuda Jinpei (22)

8
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:55,523
I could say the same thing. Matsuda Jinpei (22)

9
00:00:55,524 --> 00:00:56,084
I could say the same thing.

10
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:01,444
Blondie!

11
00:01:10,644 --> 00:01:13,463
I don't know what it is about me that you don't like,

12
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:16,954
but I have to become a police officer.

13
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:18,964
Don't get in my way.

14
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:20,834
There it is.

15
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:25,844
That I-love-cops attitude is what I hate about you.

16
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:27,893
That's ridiculous.

17
00:01:27,894 --> 00:01:32,894
You joined this academy so you could become a police officer, too.

18
00:02:08,524 --> 00:02:08,554
Who could it be at this hour?

19
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:10,853
Morofushi Hiromitsu (22) Who could it be at this hour?

20
00:02:10,854 --> 00:02:12,013
It's two in the morning. Morofushi Hiromitsu (22)

21
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:12,594
It's two in the morning.

22
00:02:14,914 --> 00:02:17,014
Huh? There's nobody here.

23
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:22,663
Huh? Z-Zero?

24
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:27,453
Sorry, Hiro. I ran out of band-aids.

25
00:02:27,454 --> 00:02:29,744
If you've got any, could you share some with me?

26
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:32,433
H-How'd you get those injuries?

27
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:35,083
Someone picked a fight with me, so I fought back.

28
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:37,314
They really got you good.

29
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:40,973
So, think you'll be able to get along with them?

30
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:43,273
What? You must be joking.

31
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:45,873
Wait in my room.

32
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,714
I'll go get the medicine box from the infirmary.

33
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,404
Thanks. I owe you one.

34
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:04,484
Finally arriving after swaying back and forth,

35
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:06,613
draw close to mysteries and begin deducing the truth!

36
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:08,313
This is the adolescence of Amuro Toru and his friends,

37
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,983
and the story of their unbreakable bond!

38
00:03:09,984 --> 00:03:11,613
Always determining the one truth

39
00:03:11,614 --> 00:03:12,404
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

40
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:13,334
Police Academy Arc with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

41
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:15,933
his name is Detective Conan! Police Academy Arc

42
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,574
Police Academy Arc

43
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:53,414
"Police Academy Arc Wild Police Story CASE. Matsuda Jinpei!"

44
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:56,114
Metropolitan Police Department Police Academy

45
00:04:56,115 --> 00:04:58,213
The Metropolitan Police Department Police Academy. Metropolitan Police Department Police Academy

46
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:58,224
Metropolitan Police Department Police Academy

47
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:02,553
Welcoming new students primarily in April and October,

48
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:08,604
it's a vocational school where roughly 1,200 students annually receive instruction and training,

49
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:11,004
in order to become fully-fledged law enforcement officers.

50
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:14,114
Assemble in three columns!

51
00:05:14,764 --> 00:05:18,264
Onizuka's class, attention!

52
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:21,723
Onizuka Hachizo (48) Rookie Class Instructor

53
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:23,123
What happened to your faces, Matsuda and Furuya? Onizuka Hachizo (48) Rookie Class Instructor

54
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:25,003
What happened to your faces, Matsuda and Furuya?

55
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:26,334
You wanna hear the story?

56
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:29,214
Yes, I'd love to hear it.

57
00:05:30,044 --> 00:05:30,314
Date Wataru (22)

58
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:33,463
Last night, a bunch of cockroaches appeared in the room. Date Wataru (22)

59
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:34,594
Last night, a bunch of cockroaches appeared in the room.

60
00:05:34,894 --> 00:05:38,974
They were so caught up in exterminating them that they hit their heads on desks.

61
00:05:39,244 --> 00:05:41,394
They had a terrible time.

62
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,604
I see. However—

63
00:05:43,814 --> 00:05:48,833
That said, as punishment for damaging school furnishings,

64
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:52,243
Onizuka's class will run an extra lap.

65
00:05:52,244 --> 00:05:53,194
Let's go.

66
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:53,934
Got it.

67
00:05:54,694 --> 00:05:55,694
Hey, wait.

68
00:05:55,695 --> 00:05:58,113
Two columns. Start running.

69
00:05:58,114 --> 00:05:59,704
Wait. I'm not done talking to you.

70
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:03,744
Hey, Jinpei-chan.

71
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:04,032
What happened to your face?

72
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,593
Hagiwara Kenji (22) What happened to your face?

73
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:07,493
You've ruined your good looks. Hagiwara Kenji (22)

74
00:06:07,494 --> 00:06:08,054
You've ruined your good looks.

75
00:06:08,055 --> 00:06:09,533
Shut up, Hagi.

76
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:13,824
You even lost your false tooth. It's hilarious.

77
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:17,174
That Furuya guy's pretty tough.

78
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:21,934
He put up quite a fight, and you were trained by your pro boxer dad.

79
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,684
So, who won?

80
00:06:25,754 --> 00:06:27,064
Well, obviously...

81
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:28,494
I did.

82
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:33,263
What? Are you sure getting hit too many times didn't make you lose your mind?

83
00:06:33,264 --> 00:06:34,653
Are you talking about yourself?

84
00:06:34,654 --> 00:06:36,314
What was that?

85
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:39,694
I don't know what happened between you guys,

86
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,734
but invite me to join you next time.

87
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:45,453
Hey, idiots!

88
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:47,363
You'd better be running properly!

89
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:47,824
One, two. One, two. One, two.

90
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:52,963
Instructor Onizuka, you've taken on some troublesome students. One, two. One, two. One, two.

91
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:55,714
Not only that, but five at once. One, two. One, two. One, two.

92
00:06:55,994 --> 00:06:56,924
Yeah.

93
00:06:57,744 --> 00:07:00,073
I drew the short end of the stick this time.

94
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:02,844
They're a peculiar bunch.

95
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:05,473
With A's in all subjects,

96
00:07:05,474 --> 00:07:10,293
he entered the academy with exceptional grades unprecedented even in the academy's long history.

97
00:07:10,294 --> 00:07:15,023
Perhaps because of his overly serious attitude and hair,

98
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:18,114
class representative Furuya can't stop getting into fights with other students.

99
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:23,993
Morofushi, whose older brother is an excellent officer with the Nagano police,

100
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:27,874
has a strong sense of justice but is still traumatized by his parents' case.

101
00:07:28,694 --> 00:07:33,543
Second to Furuya in overall ability, Date has leadership qualities,

102
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:37,384
but can't let go of his father's retirement from the force.

103
00:07:37,734 --> 00:07:42,823
Hagiwara has exceptional observational and communication skills,

104
00:07:42,824 --> 00:07:47,894
but he only uses them to chase skirts.

105
00:07:48,314 --> 00:07:50,003
Finally, there's Matsuda.

106
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:52,843
He made up for his poor interview with his studies, practical skills,

107
00:07:52,844 --> 00:07:56,463
and high level of specialized knowledge,

108
00:07:56,464 --> 00:08:00,904
but his outrageous behavior and lack of cooperativeness are fatal.

109
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:05,184
I'm worried about the future.

110
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:11,663
Anyway, police gather eyewitness information from the area around the crime scene.

111
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:11,934
Instructor Onizuka

112
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:15,414
Does anyone know what you should be careful of while doing this? Instructor Onizuka

113
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:16,324
Yes, sir.

114
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:18,763
Tell me, Furuya.

115
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:19,544
Yes, sir.

116
00:08:20,114 --> 00:08:22,603
It's important to note that with eyewitness information,

117
00:08:22,604 --> 00:08:25,804
the stress of being present during a crime, preconceptions,

118
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:31,894
or leading questions from the police can twist a witness' testimony.

119
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:35,483
Because of this, rather than blindly believing their testimony,

120
00:08:35,484 --> 00:08:38,003
it's necessary to obtain supporting evidence.

121
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:40,564
Exactly. Impressive as always, Furuya.

122
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,573
It's questionable if this academy's graduates

123
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:47,763
are actually capable of doing that.

124
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:49,293
Hey, Matsuda!

125
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:52,204
What do you think the police are?

126
00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:54,374
Well, obviously...

127
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:58,624
They serve the people with a sense of pride and duty,

128
00:08:58,994 --> 00:09:03,754
respect human rights, justly and considerately carry out their duties,

129
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:07,924
fairly uphold the law, strengthen cooperation,

130
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:13,224
cultivate their character, raise their skills, work on improving themselves,

131
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:17,663
and maintain a lifestyle of integrity and reliability.

132
00:09:17,664 --> 00:09:20,604
That's what police officers do, right?

133
00:09:21,944 --> 00:09:23,634
As long as you understand.

134
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:26,614
That's all for today's lecture.

135
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,034
Make sure you review the material on your own.

136
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:35,624
Here you go. One chicken and egg stir fry meal with a small serving of rice.

137
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:36,784
Thank you.

138
00:09:43,604 --> 00:09:46,384
You're going to sit there? Hey.

139
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:49,794
If no one's sitting here, doesn't that mean this seat is open?

140
00:09:50,844 --> 00:09:51,754
Here.

141
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,784
You've been spacing out a lot recently.

142
00:09:55,544 --> 00:09:56,474
Thanks.

143
00:09:56,824 --> 00:09:59,113
Why are you sitting here, too?

144
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:01,843
What? Isn't this seat open?

145
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:04,223
Man, I'm hungry.

146
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:07,233
Team leader, I don't want this. You can have it.

147
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:08,683
You don't?

148
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:11,843
Yeah. I don't have much of an appetite right now.

149
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,744
Then don't mind if I do.

150
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,113
Hey, have you got any sauce at this table?

151
00:10:17,114 --> 00:10:18,164
Here.

152
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:21,794
I thought procuring supplies was your specialty.

153
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:25,473
For some reason all the other tables are out.

154
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:26,694
Thanks.

155
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:30,974
Jinpei-chan, you're ruining your good looks.

156
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:32,533
What are you doing?

157
00:10:32,534 --> 00:10:34,724
You shouldn't rub that with those hands.

158
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:36,613
Mind your own business.

159
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:40,394
Here. Do it yourself, then.

160
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:44,243
That's it. Men shouldn't quibble.

161
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,173
Hagiwara-kun!

162
00:10:46,174 --> 00:10:47,444
Yes?

163
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:49,753
Can we eat lunch with you?

164
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:51,324
Of course.

165
00:10:51,714 --> 00:10:51,914
Here's the sauce.

166
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:53,333
What's with the change of heart you had during class earlier? Here's the sauce.

167
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:55,623
All the tables are out, so you can use this. What's with the change of heart you had during class earlier?

168
00:10:55,624 --> 00:10:56,494
All the tables are out, so you can use this.

169
00:10:56,834 --> 00:11:01,874
If I recall correctly, you hate police officers.

170
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,904
Don't tell me you're hot-and-cold for them.

171
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:10,053
You can't seriously be blond at a police academy.

172
00:11:10,054 --> 00:11:11,363
Leave it.

173
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:12,754
I'm not.

174
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:16,394
I still hate them at heart.

175
00:11:20,204 --> 00:11:25,004
Police officers can eat shit.

176
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:34,744
Found it.

177
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:35,264
<b>Murder Pro Boxer Matsuda Jotaro Suspect Matsuda Arrested</b>

178
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:36,283
This is it. <b>Murder Pro Boxer Matsuda Jotaro Suspect Matsuda Arrested</b>

179
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:36,744
<b>Murder Pro Boxer Matsuda Jotaro Suspect Matsuda Arrested</b>

180
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:40,744
Pro boxer Matsuda Jotaro, arrested for murder.

181
00:11:41,754 --> 00:11:45,103
That case caused quite an uproar at the time.

182
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,123
Hiro.

183
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:46,944
Reference Room

184
00:11:46,945 --> 00:11:49,634
You're looking into Matsuda's father, huh? Reference Room

185
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:54,344
Yeah. I wanted to know why he hates cops so much.

186
00:11:54,944 --> 00:11:58,893
I heard about it from Matsuda's friend Hagiwara.

187
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:00,764
Apparently it was a mistaken arrest.

188
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:03,024
What? A mistaken arrest?

189
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,143
On his way home from the gym,

190
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:10,024
Matsuda's pro boxer father saw some men engaged in a scuffle.

191
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:15,383
Because he had a title match coming up, he avoided getting involved and left the area.

192
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:19,534
But the next day, one of the men was found dead at the scene.

193
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:22,273
Because witnesses claimed to have seen

194
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,574
Matsuda's father near the area when the crime took place,

195
00:12:26,244 --> 00:12:29,094
the victim was a former boxer who had history with him,

196
00:12:29,544 --> 00:12:33,294
and the victim was bludgeoned to death, the police arrested Matsuda' father.

197
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:38,523
Later, the true culprit was arrested, and he was cleared of charges,

198
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,383
but his scheduled title match was called off.

199
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:45,964
He quit boxing and drowned himself in drink like a changed man.

200
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:51,044
I see. So that's why he hates the police.

201
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:55,283
But why would he want to become a police officer?

202
00:12:55,284 --> 00:13:00,183
Who knows? Even Hagiwara admitted that was a mystery to him.

203
00:13:00,184 --> 00:13:02,243
Whoops, look at the time.

204
00:13:02,244 --> 00:13:04,704
It's a bit early, but shall we head to the classroom?

205
00:13:05,004 --> 00:13:07,074
You go on without me, Zero.

206
00:13:08,364 --> 00:13:11,403
There's something I want to look up here.

207
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:13,713
I see. Don't be late.

208
00:13:13,714 --> 00:13:15,714
Case Type: Murder Location: Nagano Prefecture, Family Home Damage Report: One Man and Woman (Married Couple) Dead Case Status: Unsolved Nagano Family Murdered

209
00:13:21,204 --> 00:13:22,044
Hiro...

210
00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:26,984
Listen closely. What you're holding right now is a Sakura.

211
00:13:27,454 --> 00:13:31,394
This five-round revolver is the official firearm of the Japanese police.

212
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,483
In this shooting test, you'll fire four sets of five rounds.

213
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:38,244
Your score will be the total of your two best sets.

214
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,744
A score of less than 70 is a failing grade.

215
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:48,353
Five shots practically right in the middle.

216
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:49,964
Nice shooting, Furuya-chan.

217
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:55,893
Furuya, you've got a knack for shooting, but don't forget that there's always someone better than you.

218
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:59,393
There's a genius who scored full points on his first test—

219
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:04,224
in other words, he fired all 20 shots right into the middle.

220
00:14:06,024 --> 00:14:11,394
He must currently be a top cop in Division 1, then.

221
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:17,904
Actually, he quit the force and currently runs a detective agency in Beika City.

222
00:14:19,844 --> 00:14:22,353
Damn it, I can't hit the thing at all.

223
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:23,993
What's wrong, Matsuda?

224
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:27,294
You're quick to fight, but handling a gun's too difficult for you?

225
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:30,544
Are you sure someone didn't drop this gun?

226
00:14:32,774 --> 00:14:36,083
Revolvers are sensitive to being dropped.

227
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,424
Maybe the cylinder stop's broken.

228
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:41,844
Don't be ridiculous! Hurry up and shoot!

229
00:14:42,354 --> 00:14:45,133
You're always quibbling over everything.

230
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,474
H-Hey, Matsuda.

231
00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:54,243
I knew it. The cylinder stop's broken.

232
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:57,073
The barrel and cylinder were out of alignment, too.

233
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:59,063
No wonder I couldn't hit anything.

234
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,143
Matsuda, put that thing back together immediately!

235
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:02,864
Huh?

236
00:15:03,064 --> 00:15:06,243
Yeesh, he's at it again.

237
00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:07,144
Again?

238
00:15:07,144 --> 00:15:07,994
Yeah.

239
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,003
Jinpei-chan's an analysis fiend.

240
00:15:11,004 --> 00:15:15,544
He's always had to analyze everything since he was a kid.

241
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:20,054
Because of it, he knows a lot about gadgets, especially bombs.

242
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:22,844
The shooting test is canceled!

243
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:25,093
Return your firearms immediately!

244
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:27,604
Matsuda, stay there!

245
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:31,463
What? One bullet hasn't been returned?

246
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,234
Yes, sir.

247
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:37,484
I recounted all the guns, but I came up one round short.

248
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:42,993
Well, I say all of them, but I still haven't collected Matsuda's gun.

249
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:46,513
Matsuda! Why haven't you put it back together yet?

250
00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:49,664
What? You're the one who told me to stay here.

251
00:15:50,234 --> 00:15:53,103
Forget it. Just hand over the bullet you swiped.

252
00:15:53,104 --> 00:15:55,213
I don't have any bullets on me.

253
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:58,503
I fired all my rounds. I even handled over my empty cartridges.

254
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:00,093
Don't lie to me!

255
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:01,263
Huh?

256
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:05,693
Now, now. Out of consideration for your team leader, let's lay down our arms.

257
00:16:05,694 --> 00:16:07,844
I promise we'll return the bullet.

258
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,023
Excuse me, Instructor Onizuka.

259
00:16:10,024 --> 00:16:14,523
Is it all right if I check on the roof repairs?

260
00:16:14,524 --> 00:16:16,294
Sure, I'll show you the way.

261
00:16:16,994 --> 00:16:20,713
You'd better make him turn in that bullet voluntarily.

262
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:21,564
Yes, sir.

263
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:24,664
What? You think I did it, too?

264
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:26,614
It wasn't you, right?

265
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:27,714
No.

266
00:16:27,715 --> 00:16:29,943
Then hold your head high.

267
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:34,004
I'll uncover the true culprit and make them turn themselves in.

268
00:16:34,444 --> 00:16:36,463
You're too soft on him, team leader.

269
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:41,443
Make him prove his own innocence, or he'll end up like his father.

270
00:16:41,444 --> 00:16:44,634
You don't know the first thing about my dad.

271
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:47,983
Yeah, so why don't you tell me about him?

272
00:16:47,984 --> 00:16:51,894
While you're at it, you can tell me why you're trying to become a cop, too.

273
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:55,024
Sure, I'll tell you,

274
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:58,854
after I knock you on your ass!

275
00:17:18,514 --> 00:17:21,134
This isn't good. The lifeline's wrapped around the instructor's neck.

276
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:24,363
The worker who fell looks unconscious.

277
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:26,594
We're going to go get help!

278
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:28,224
Will you make it in time?

279
00:17:28,484 --> 00:17:30,363
We have to climb up to the roof and cut the rope!

280
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:32,224
You idiot, there's no time for that!

281
00:17:32,464 --> 00:17:34,453
But at this rate, the instructor...

282
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:37,854
You guys know what to do, right?

283
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:39,234
Get a gun.

284
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:40,234
Find a bullet.

285
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:41,734
Take the shot.

286
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:43,484
I'll be the foundation.

287
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:47,244
Does that make me the supporting rod on top of you?

288
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:49,904
Yeah! Come on, guys!

289
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:51,824
Let's go!

290
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,334
Morofushi!

291
00:18:00,054 --> 00:18:02,174
You should be able to breathe a little easier now.

292
00:18:02,474 --> 00:18:04,544
Our friends are will be here to help us soon.

293
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:07,304
Try not to die until then.

294
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,013
How long?

295
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:09,894
Huh?

296
00:18:09,895 --> 00:18:13,534
How long does it take you to assemble that gun?

297
00:18:14,054 --> 00:18:16,434
Well, generally...

298
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:20,854
One round.

299
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:24,793
One round? Three minutes? That long?

300
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:29,534
Yeah. Just assembling the thing wouldn't take me 30 seconds.

301
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:32,424
But not only is the gun broken to begin with,

302
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:36,444
it needs to be precise enough to fire accurately without test firing.

303
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:42,174
We need you to shoot that rope with a single shot, blondie.

304
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:46,924
You'll use the bullet Hagiwara's finding right now.

305
00:18:47,264 --> 00:18:49,254
Excuse me.

306
00:18:49,804 --> 00:18:52,594
Huh? What's this?

307
00:18:52,894 --> 00:18:56,974
Hey, there's a bullet lying right here.

308
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:10,444
Bingo.

309
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:13,173
H-Huh? It's still here.

310
00:19:13,174 --> 00:19:16,083
You're the one who swiped the bullet, aren't you?

311
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:20,664
S-Sorry. I wanted something to remember my first firearms training by.

312
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:24,624
Damn it.

313
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:27,243
Something's still not right.

314
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:28,734
Don't panic.

315
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:34,254
A person's respiratory center stops functioning within a minute of being strangled,

316
00:19:34,984 --> 00:19:37,894
but the heart continues to beat for several minutes.

317
00:19:38,164 --> 00:19:42,833
Even if their heart stops, as long as lifesaving measures are performed within three minutes,

318
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:47,654
it's entirely possible to save a person without any brain damage.

319
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:50,194
Let's go, Furuya-chan!

320
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:52,034
Catch!

321
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:58,164
Take this, too. The gun's perfect.

322
00:19:59,044 --> 00:20:02,254
If you miss, I'll kill you, Zero.

323
00:20:15,894 --> 00:20:17,344
Sir, we brought help!

324
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:30,114
Sir! Instructor Onizuka!

325
00:22:04,744 --> 00:22:08,393
There was a serious violation of firearm handling rules,

326
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:13,154
but at Instructor Onizuka's recommendation, they're going to overlook this incident.

327
00:22:13,814 --> 00:22:15,143
Of course they are.

328
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:18,464
We dragged him back from the brink of death.

329
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:22,724
Apparently your father was arrested mistakenly.

330
00:22:24,054 --> 00:22:27,104
Hagi told you, didn't he? He's got a big mouth.

331
00:22:27,424 --> 00:22:30,833
I'm sorry about the mistaken arrest, but in that case—

332
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:36,234
It's likely the murder wouldn't have occurred if he'd stopped the fight, right?

333
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,914
I know that,

334
00:22:39,594 --> 00:22:45,784
but I can't forgive the police for acting like nothing happened after crushing my dad's dream.

335
00:22:46,154 --> 00:22:50,133
So, why do you want to become a police officer?

336
00:22:50,134 --> 00:22:52,593
That's obvious.

337
00:22:52,594 --> 00:22:56,134
Because I want to kick his ass and dispel these pent-up feelings.

338
00:22:58,074 --> 00:23:02,624
The boss of the MPD—the chief of police.

339
00:23:06,704 --> 00:23:08,333
What's so funny?

340
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:11,313
That won't be easy.

341
00:23:11,314 --> 00:23:14,404
Why are you trying to become a cop, anyway?

342
00:23:16,714 --> 00:23:18,904
So I can find someone.

343
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:25,254
I'm looking for a woman very dear to me who suddenly disappeared.

344
00:23:27,354 --> 00:23:31,414
A woman? You're surprisingly shallow.

345
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:37,174
Right?

346
00:23:45,294 --> 00:23:49,604
Please find the past that's been erased from my memory.

347
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:51,854
Find the past?

348
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:55,354
Maybe it's just a misunderstanding.

349
00:23:55,604 --> 00:23:59,024
It's all right. You don't have to try so hard.

350
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:00,784
Yeah.

351
00:24:01,224 --> 00:24:02,574
What happened?

352
00:24:03,294 --> 00:24:07,664
Apparently they regretted some bad choices they made.

353
00:24:09,494 --> 00:24:13,764
