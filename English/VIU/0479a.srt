Really! This place is bustling with the cherry blossom festival too,

22
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:05,819
so I'm glad we came here!

23
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,119
Yep, thanks, Ran!

24
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:11,519
Shouldn't you be thanking Detective Kogoro Mouri here,

25
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,119
who suddenly gets a call from a high school student from Osaka

26
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,019
saying that she wants to go flower viewing

27
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,619
and speeds her over here from early in the morning

28
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:21,019
to grant her wish, huh?

29
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,619
-Yes. -I know!

30
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:26,419
Well, there seems to be people who rather than feel gratitude

31
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:29,819
prefer bread to the song of birds though.

32
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:33,219
Oh boy, I mean Heiji's the one who wanted to go flower viewing.

33
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:36,119
Hey, Kazuha!

34
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:37,819
This pinwheel is cute!

35
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,519
Really! I'm going to buy one.

36
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,019
How much, sir?

37
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:43,219
200 yen.

38
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:45,019
Oh, one for me too.

39
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:01,119
Hey, what're you doing standing there doing nothing!

40
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:04,819
You called me over because you wanted something, right?

41
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:06,019
Oh, yeah.

42
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:10,019
Something about a high school student wearing glasses.

43
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,919
Oh, right, Eisuke Hondo.

44
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:17,419
He's a junior in high school and is Ran's classmate.

45
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:19,619
I wonder if you could check on something for me.

46
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,919
Huh? Why me?

47
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,319
Does he have something to do with Osaka?

48
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,819
No, the one I want you to check on

49
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:28,919
is the one whose eyes resemble that of this Eisuke Hondo guy

50
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,819
and is a member of the Black Organization

51
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:33,019
Rena Mizunashi!

52
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:37,619
Mizunashi is an announcer for Nichiuri TV, isn't she?

53
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:39,119
She seems to be on leave right now,

54
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:41,119
but you mean she's a bad person?

55
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:44,419
Hattori!

56
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,119
You're talking too loud! Hey!

57
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:52,019
She's on leave because she got into an accident

58
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,419
during a chase with the F.B.I. and was hurt badly.

59
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,419
She's in a certain hospital right now and lying unconscious there.

60
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,019
And?

61
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:01,319
The more so, then why me?

62
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,919
If you want somebody to check, why not ask that thin,

63
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,519
what was his name? Officer Takagi.

64
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,919
A picture.

65
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:12,919
The picture of a woman who looks exactly like Rena Mizunashi

66
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,919
was coincidentally taken 10 years ago

67
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:17,919
seems to have been uploaded on a website for some time.

68
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,519
The woman was standing in front of Tsutenkaku,

69
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,319
carrying a convenience store shopping bag!

70
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,719
Which means that the woman was living in Osaka?

71
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,919
I can't come to any conclusion yet

72
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,019
but I tried contacting the TV station to confirm thing with her.

73
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:34,119
However, a few days after I wrote,

74
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:36,819
the website was closed.

75
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:39,519
Something's fishy, don't you think?

76
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,119
That's why I want you to hurry and check things out for me.

77
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,319
Make sure Eisuke Hondo

78
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,619
who's sniffing around about her doesn't beat you to it!

79
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:49,919
If so, wouldn't it be faster for you

80
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,819
to nab that Hondo guy and make him spit it out?

81
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,419
If those two look alike, they may be blood related,

82
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,419
and she may be a villain too.

83
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,019
No, I don't think they're family.

84
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:06,019
I can't help feeling that

85
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:08,619
something about the way Eisuke Hondo acts is strange.

86
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,519
How do you do, Detective Mouri?

87
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,319
It's an honor to get to see you!

88
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,019
See! Just like there was no scratch there to begin with!

89
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:22,319
A new student who suddenly transferred and came to Ran's high school.

90
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,119
Which means that Rena Mizunashi whose eyes resemble his is...

91
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:29,719
Yeah, a member of the Black Organization.

92
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:31,019
They probably changed the face of one of their members

93
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:33,219
with plastic surgery to one of Eisuke Hondo's family

94
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,919
and became that person, quite an easy feat for them to accomplish.

95
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:39,919
At any rate, please have Inspector Ohtaki

96
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,819
check carefully and in secret

97
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:45,419
whether there was a woman named Mizunashi or Hondo

98
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,019
living in Osaka or not.

99
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:50,419
I see. If that woman really existed

100
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:54,419
and a case of a woman suddenly disappearing is found, it's bingo.

101
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,519
It really disappeared!

102
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,719
Just as if she was spirited away!

103
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:05,319
It's probably some work of fate that I ran into you here.

104
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,519
Please, I beg you.

105
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,719
Will you please solve the mystery of this case?

106
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:10,219
-Well... -What?

107
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:11,819
What's the matter, Pops?

108
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,819
This monk suddenly...

109
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,919
What? A person disappeared?

110
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,519
Yes. I'm a disciple at that temple, my name is Denkyu.

111
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:28,519
A person who came to visit the head monk the other day

112
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,819
suddenly disappeared from the room.

113
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:35,019
Suddenly?

114
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:38,219
She was a woman with long hair,

115
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,719
and spent the night at the annex.

116
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,519
But, when I went to tell her that breakfast was ready...

117
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,419
She was gone?

118
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:49,419
Maybe she decided to go home before eating breakfast?

119
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:53,819
No, she was actually in the room at that time

120
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:55,619
but I found her stabbed in the stomach with a knife,

121
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,719
dead and lying on the floor.

122
00:08:57,719 --> 00:09:00,319
-What? -Are you saying that she was dead?

123
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:01,819
Yes.

124
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:04,219
Did you report it to the police?

125
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:05,319
Of course,

126
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:08,919
right after I let the head monk who was resting at the temple know.

127
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:12,319
Then, don't tell me that the one who disappeared is...

128
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:16,319
Yes, when the police came and arrived at the annex,

129
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:19,119
only the head monk was in the room.

130
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:22,719
There were no signs of the woman

131
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:25,719
nor the blood stain that was on the tatami.

132
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:26,719
No...

133
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:29,819
And, what did the head monk say?

134
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,919
That the visitor left early in the morning,

135
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,119
and that maybe I was dreaming.

136
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:37,419
Are you sure you really weren't still half asleep?

137
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:41,019
No way. I really saw it with my own eyes!

138
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:45,519
Okay, if you insist, let's go to the temple

139
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,419
and hear what the head monk has to say, then.

140
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:54,519
You're that famous Detective Kogoro Mouri.

141
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,219
"Shakuren" -What brings a famed person like you

142
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:58,219
"A Buddhist priest" -all the way up

143
00:09:58,219 --> 00:10:00,019
to a small mountain temple like this?

144
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:04,019
Well, you see, Denkyu, a disciple of your temple...

145
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,219
Oh...

146
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:09,019
You want to know about that dream story of Denkyu

147
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:12,719
about the visitor who came here and disappeared out of the blue?

148
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,219
Well, sort of...

149
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:18,219
Well, to be honest, we just came to check things out.

150
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:21,219
To confirm whether what this monk saw was just an illusion

151
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:26,319
or whether you cleaned the corpse and everything up

152
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:29,419
before the police got here.

153
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,019
Heiji!

154
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,719
You have quite an interesting point of view, young man.

155
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:40,119
All right, let me take you over to the annex in question.

156
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:48,219
To the room that Denkyu insists swallowed up one whole person.

157
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:56,819
It sure takes a while to get to that annex, doesn't it?

158
00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:00,619
Wow! The temple looks to be so far away already.

159
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,219
You can say that again!

160
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:05,019
There it is.

161
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:06,719
That's it.

162
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:09,319
It sure is an old looking building.

163
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:13,619
Yes, it's already been 50 years since it was built.

164
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:19,719
Please do come in.

165
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:24,719
One room is 8-mats and there are 4 room all together.

166
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:28,119
And, where's the place that woman's body was found?

167
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:31,519
Right around there to the upper right of this room.

168
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:36,419
-Well? -Nothing.

169
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:39,719
It's not a reversible mat either.

170
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,319
Oh, a statue of Buddha.

171
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:44,819
Guardians of the temple?

172
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:48,819
That's one of the Four Heavenly Kings, Tamonten.

173
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:51,919
This room facing north is called Tamonten.

174
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,319
To the west is Koumokuten,

175
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:56,619
the south Zoujyoten

176
00:11:56,619 --> 00:11:58,819
and the east Jikokuten.

177
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,319
A Buddhist statue is inside each of the rooms.

178
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:05,119
Oh, you may touch it but please don't scratch it.

179
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:07,719
After all, the Buddhist statues are precious statues

180
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:10,819
that have been handed down to Shokakuji from one generation to the next.

181
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:13,019
Oh, is that right?

182
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,819
Well, it's already late today.

183
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:19,119
I suggest that you spend the night here tonight,

184
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:21,919
and start investigations tomorrow at dawn?

185
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,219
That is, only if you feel that you have more to check on.

186
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:27,819
Oh...

187
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:31,619
Are you serious about spending the night here at this temple?

188
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:33,519
I'm sure that it's only that the monk was half awake

189
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,219
and made a mistake!

190
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:38,719
That's right, so let's all head back to Ran's place.

191
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,719
It's you.

192
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:48,319
This time, in the middle of the room of the annex...

193
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:51,119
There's a woman with a knife stabbed through her stomach!

194
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:54,219
Is it in the same room?

195
00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:56,719
Yes. Exactly the same as back then.

196
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:04,319
There's nobody here?

197
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:06,819
It can't be.

198
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,219
It was here for sure a while ago.

199
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:11,019
I guess I'll have to tell you about it after all.

200
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:12,719
Osho!

201
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:17,519
The fact is, there was no visitor at this temple on that day.

202
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,219
I've got to also so add that you were just chasing

203
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:24,519
the shadow of your mother who passed on long ago.

204
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:27,119
Oh, no...

205
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,719
No.

206
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:42,021
"Red. Disappeared Bloodstain" -I saw it with my very eyes.

207
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,321
"Red. Disappeared Bloodstain" -I'm trying to tell you that

208
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:48,921
it's all an illusion you imagined because you miss your mother.

209
00:13:48,921 --> 00:13:50,221
It can't be...

210
00:13:50,221 --> 00:13:52,921
Your poor mother who threw herself in the ocean

211
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:56,521
after bringing you here to this temple, and placing you in my custody.

212
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:57,721
In your custody?

213
00:13:57,721 --> 00:14:00,321
Yes, Denkyu here is an abandoned child,

214
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:02,521
whom I, who had just become the head priest of this temple

215
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:05,721
adopted and brought up for 18 years.

216
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:08,321
I'm not good at refusing

217
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:11,221
and have ended up raising 2 or 3 others too.

218
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:14,621
But, it seems that they didn't like it here and left,

219
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,321
so only Denkyu and I are at this temple now.

220
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:18,821
Even after being apart so long,

221
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:21,221
Denkyu can't forget about his dear mother.

222
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:23,521
Which means that just like you say,

223
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:27,521
the dead body of the woman Denkyu says he saw the other day was...

224
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:31,921
Right, we didn't even have visitors that day.

225
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:34,221
However, three days ago, that morning,

226
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:38,221
Denkyu ran in here looking pale.

227
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:40,321
I thought that maybe someone who got lost in the mountains

228
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:43,421
came uninvited to this annex

229
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:45,821
and came here to check.

230
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:48,521
But, just like tonight, there was no one here.

231
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:53,121
Yes, I felt sorry for Denkyu who insisted on seeing such an illusion that

232
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:55,121
when the police came,

233
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:57,821
I went along with his story without thinking,

234
00:14:57,821 --> 00:15:01,721
saying that a woman visitor came here early in the morning.

235
00:15:01,721 --> 00:15:04,621
So, now has the mystery been solved?

236
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:06,221
Well, sort of.

237
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:07,821
No.

238
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:12,321
I'm sure the woman was here in this room

239
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:16,321
at least three days ago, when Denkyu said he saw her.

240
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:20,621
Do you or Denkyu like to dress yourselves in woman's clothes?

241
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:22,221
Woman's clothes?

242
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,821
You! What stupid thing are you talking about?

243
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:27,521
Look what I found.

244
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:29,021
See!

245
00:15:29,021 --> 00:15:31,821
This is the back catch of a pierced earring?

246
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:33,321
When we were checking to see

247
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:36,121
if the tatami of this room was double matted

248
00:15:36,121 --> 00:15:38,321
and flipped it over,

249
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:40,521
this kid found it.

250
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:43,221
The back catch of pierced earrings easily come off

251
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:45,021
so it probably came off accidentally

252
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:48,721
and got stuck in between the tatami

253
00:15:48,721 --> 00:15:52,721
but the problem is, whose pierce it is?

254
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:54,621
We've got to track down who the owner of this pierce back catch

255
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,621
that is still shiny as if it hasn't been here for long after it came off.

256
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:00,121
Come to think of it.

257
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:01,721
The woman that came three days ago also

258
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:03,621
wore pierced earrings!

259
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:07,121
Then, the answers simple!

260
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:09,821
The one who Denkyu saw was not an illusion.

261
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:11,121
No.

262
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:13,521
The one who was wearing the earring

263
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:15,021
was probably either Bunkyu or Rinkyu

264
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:20,121
who were disciples here at this temple until two months ago.

265
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:22,021
Bunkyu and Rinkyu?

266
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:24,521
Remember, I mentioned a while ago that

267
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:28,421
I adopted two other children besides Denkyu.

268
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:32,921
Unlike Denkyu, they were both forever prone to mischief.

269
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:36,821
They used to sneak out of the temple night after night and go to town.

270
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:38,021
Moreover, they used to disguise themselves as women

271
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:40,521
so people wouldn't suspect them to be monks.

272
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:41,921
Disguise?

273
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:45,121
Yes. I don't know where they got a hold of it

274
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:48,021
but they wore a wig, pierced earrings and a long dress,

275
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:51,521
just like those the young people wear nowadays.

276
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:53,121
Is that true?

277
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:54,721
Yes.

278
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:56,521
Those two used to frequently drink liquor

279
00:16:56,521 --> 00:16:59,021
secretly in this annex too.

280
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:02,221
Osho found out about it, and the two had a good scolding.

281
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:07,221
They didn't like it, so they both left this temple together.

282
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:11,621
They seem to have been using this annex to change clothes and all,

283
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:14,821
so the backing must've accidentally come off.

284
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:17,721
So, that's the story! Convinced?

285
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,821
You still don't look convinced, I see.

286
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:26,321
Then do check things out for yourselves to your heart's content.

287
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:27,621
If as Denkyu says

288
00:17:27,621 --> 00:17:31,121
there was a blood smeared corpse in the middle of the room,

289
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:35,721
the blood should be found somewhere on the tatami.

290
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:39,221
Ran.

291
00:17:39,221 --> 00:17:40,921
Don't you think Heiji and the others are a bit late?

292
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:44,521
Yeah, I wonder if something happened.

293
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:48,021
Okay, Ran, wait here then! I'll go check!

294
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:50,221
Oh, I'll go too, then!

295
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:00,421
Don't you think that it's better for us

296
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:04,421
to just wait here without moving after all, Ran?

297
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:06,621
I guess so.

298
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:32,121
Around where on the floor was that woman?

299
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:35,521
Oh, yes. She was right around here three days ago,

300
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:38,321
lying on the floor like this.

301
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:41,521
Then, what about the woman you saw a while ago?

302
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,621
In the middle of the room,

303
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:45,121
like so.

304
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:47,521
Was there a lot of blood?

305
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:48,821
Yeah.

306
00:18:48,821 --> 00:18:50,721
Three days ago as well as tonight,

307
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:53,521
there was a lot of bleeding from the stomach.

308
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:57,121
Then, 10 to 1 it's not possible.

309
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:59,621
Maybe possible with the corpse he saw yesterday.

310
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:04,021
But if the corpse he saw lying there just a while ago is real,

311
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:07,921
there should be a blood stained tatami on the side

312
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:11,921
but even looks around now, there's no such tatami around!

313
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:14,421
You think so too. Did I actually see

314
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:18,821
an illusion of my mother that never existed in the first place after all?

315
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:23,021
So, are you convinced now?

316
00:19:23,021 --> 00:19:24,921
Yes, very.

317
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:28,121
Then, Denkyu, please show these people to the gate.

318
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:29,121
Yes, sir.

319
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:32,121
I'll stay here in this room for a while

320
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:34,021
and offer prayer to the Four Heavenly Kings

321
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:38,021
in apology of having been a bit of a nuisance with all the fuss here.

322
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:43,721
I'm sorry for keeping you here for so long because of my mistake.

323
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:48,221
No, don't be, but why were you there at that time in that annex?

324
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,021
I always go and check to see

325
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:52,721
if the doors are locked before dinner.

326
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:55,821
Bunkyu and Rinkyu

327
00:19:55,821 --> 00:20:00,921
were actually in charge of cleaning and locking the annex up.

328
00:20:00,921 --> 00:20:02,721
But, after their drinking incident,

329
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:07,021
Osho did the cleaning and I was in charge of locking up.

330
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:09,021
Not only did they drink liquor,

331
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:11,821
but I'll be the two were also smoking in there too?

332
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:13,821
How do you know?

333
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:18,421
They both said they succeeded in smoking secretly.

334
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:20,021
What a conspicuous secret.

335
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:23,621
There was an obviously burnt spot on the tatami.

336
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:26,721
Come to think of it, there were remains of spilt beer too.

337
00:20:26,721 --> 00:20:30,721
Yeah but what I don't understand is why both the remains...

338
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:34,421
They weren't there when we checked at sundown today.

339
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:36,421
Right, Heiji?

340
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:38,321
-Right! -Don't tell me that

341
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:41,421
someone switched the tatami?

342
00:20:41,421 --> 00:20:44,021
I'm just saying that it's possible.

343
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:45,621
No way.

344
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:48,221
I'm sure you guys already know if you checked too,

345
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:51,921
but the tatami at the annex was not double-sided,

346
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:55,921
and besides, it was old and discolored from the sun.

347
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,321
Even if a tatami from someplace else

348
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:59,121
were to have been brought in and replaced,

349
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:01,721
the discoloration would make it apparent.

350
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:04,721
You mean switching isn't possible?

351
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,721
Switching the tatami of one of the four 8-mat floors.

352
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:10,621
To go from Pop's car to that annex

353
00:21:10,621 --> 00:21:13,121
would take 7 to 8 minutes going and coming back,

354
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:16,121
if you run, that's enough time to switch the tatami!

355
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:19,021
Come to think of it, something always felt different from usual,

356
00:21:19,021 --> 00:21:20,821
each time I found the bodies.

357
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,321
Right? I'll bet

358
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:24,621
the direction the tatami is placed or something is different?

359
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:27,521
Oh, but it's only that I have this feeling.

360
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:29,921
No matter how you replace the tatami,

361
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,221
you can't hide the blood stain.

362
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:34,121
If the body was lying smeared with blood in the middle of the room,

363
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:38,721
there should be blood on more than two tatamis!

364
00:21:38,721 --> 00:21:40,021
Well, the only thing that did look suspicious

365
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:43,921
were the statues of the Four Heavenly Kings in the corner of the rooms

366
00:21:43,921 --> 00:21:46,521
but they were inside transparent glass cases.

367
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:50,321
When the statue was moved, the tatami under it was in view,

368
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,621
so the blood couldn't have been hidden.

369
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:54,721
Let's pull out, pull out!

370
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:58,221
I can't be wasting my time on this silly story!

371
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:02,921
Huh? A mistake?

372
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,921
Are you saying that there was no corpse?

373
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:08,721
No, it was this monk's illusion.

374
00:22:08,721 --> 00:22:10,021
I'm sorry.

375
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:13,421
But, I'm glad that nobody was dead then.

376
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:16,521
Okay, hurry and get in then, so we can head back to Ran's house.

377
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:18,621
The pinwheel.

378
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:20,421
Oh no, I squashed it.

379
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:23,121
It's okay, because it's not all that bent out of shape.

380
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:24,521
Why?

381
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:27,221
Why did the burnt remain that wasn't there at sundown

382
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:30,021
appear suddenly at night?

383
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:32,021
It was hidden out of sight?

384
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:33,721
But, where?

385
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:39,021
Heiji...

386
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:46,121
Hey, you...

387
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:52,821
This is it! This!

388
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:55,421
I've figured out where the blood stain is hidden!

389
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:57,621
Yeah, I thought of that too!

390
00:22:57,621 --> 00:22:59,421
Yeah,

391
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,421
completely!
