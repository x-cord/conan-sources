1
00:00:02,953 --> 00:00:05,353
This way. It's over here.

2
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:11,063
I found this bracelet beneath these shrubs.

3
00:00:11,373 --> 00:00:12,932
I see.

4
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:17,372
I'm impressed that you spotted something down here, though.

5
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:20,453
I took a peek because I heard a kitty meow.

6
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:22,833
That's when I found this on the ground.

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,823
I see.

8
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:28,572
But this looks pretty expensive.

9
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:30,812
It's got a jewel or something on it.

10
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:33,162
Yes, it's a garnet.

11
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:34,913
Like I said...

12
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:40,093
Conan.

13
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:42,003
Hey, Conan.

14
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:44,722
What are you doing?

15
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:46,353
Nothing.

16
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:50,643
Why don't we return this bracelet to whoever lost it?

17
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:55,452
Good idea. That sounds like a job for the Detective Boys.

18
00:00:55,453 --> 00:00:58,193
But how are we going to find them?

19
00:00:59,213 --> 00:01:02,482
If we can find the store that sells that bracelet,

20
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:05,643
we should be able to find whoever lost it.

21
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:09,262
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

22
00:01:09,263 --> 00:01:11,542
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

23
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:12,963
The Detective Boys are in big trouble!

24
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:15,142
Their search for the owner of a missing item takes a surprising turn!

25
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:16,852
Always determining the one truth

26
00:01:16,853 --> 00:01:18,742
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

27
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:21,283
his name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,243
"The Lost Article That Smells Like a Case!"

29
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:12,953
Kaneko Jewelry

30
00:03:16,783 --> 00:03:18,852
I feel like I've seen this before.

31
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:20,102
Really?

32
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:20,843
Yeah.

33
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:23,713
It might be one of our products.

34
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:25,593
Might be?

35
00:03:26,043 --> 00:03:28,223
Or it might not be.

36
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:36,733
Well, we used to sell a similar design.

37
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:41,583
The initials S.Y. are on the back.

38
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:47,033
Sorry. Since we didn't sell it, I don't know.

39
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:07,903
We haven't been able to find them.

40
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:12,242
Is turning it into the police our only option?

41
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:14,143
I'm hungry.

42
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:23,273
Hey, kids!

43
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:26,193
It's the guy from the accessory shop.

44
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:28,802
When I asked the other staff about it,

45
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:32,833
one of them said they remembered the person who bought that bracelet.

46
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:34,663
Really?

47
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:37,962
Yeah. Their name is Yamaki Shinobu.

48
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:41,213
Since you've already got their bracelet, could you return it to them?

49
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:43,133
You can count on us!

50
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:51,143
This is the place.

51
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:54,143
All right. Let's ask if that bracelet is theirs.

52
00:04:56,303 --> 00:04:57,703
Coming.

53
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:01,163
Yes?

54
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:05,023
Um, can I help you?

55
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:07,443
Miss, are you Yamaki Shinobu-san?

56
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,862
Shinobu is my older brother.

57
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:13,772
What? Your brother?

58
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:16,963
Yes, and? Do you have business with my brother?

59
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:25,812
We found a bracelet that we believe belongs to your brother at the park.

60
00:05:25,813 --> 00:05:26,913
This is it.

61
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:31,593
See? It's got the initials S.Y. on it.

62
00:05:32,313 --> 00:05:34,853
That's definitely my brother's.

63
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:36,283
All right.

64
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:38,223
We finally found him.

65
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,852
Thank you for coming all this way to return it.

66
00:05:41,853 --> 00:05:44,353
My name is Yamaki Risa.

67
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:46,733
Hey, where's your brother?

68
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:50,363
What? Oh, he's out of the house right now.

69
00:05:50,753 --> 00:05:54,382
I'll return this bracelet to my brother.

70
00:05:54,383 --> 00:05:55,672
Please do.

71
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:57,012
We're counting on you.

72
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:58,242
Here you go.

73
00:05:58,243 --> 00:05:59,643
Thank you.

74
00:06:00,673 --> 00:06:02,362
Give me a second.

75
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,713
It could be important.

76
00:06:05,203 --> 00:06:05,953
There.

77
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:10,263
Miss.

78
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:13,322
You smell wonderful.

79
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:14,973
Must be your perfume.

80
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:18,482
Thank you. It's my favorite perfume.

81
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:19,633
I see.

82
00:06:22,763 --> 00:06:26,452
I'm glad we were able to return the bracelet to its owner.

83
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:29,483
Yes. His sister was delighted, too.

84
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:31,482
That settles that.

85
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:32,593
Yeah!

86
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,432
Sorry.

87
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:37,743
I forgot that Ran-neechan asked me to run an errand for her.

88
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:38,923
Oh, no.

89
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:40,543
Shall we go with you?

90
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:42,662
Nah, I'll be fine.

91
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:44,463
Careful on your way home, guys.

92
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:18,163
Sorry for visiting out of the blue, Oi-san.

93
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:21,663
Oh, it's fine. You're Yamaki-san's...

94
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:24,292
I'm his sister Risa.

95
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:28,462
I actually lost touch with my brother this week.

96
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:29,313
What?

97
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:33,303
I visited his home, but he hasn't been back in a while.

98
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:36,803
I see. That's concerning.

99
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:42,418
Anyway, these are the last messages I exchanged with my brother.

100
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,183
(When do you want to meet up? I'm eating with my friend Oi now. I'll call you tomorrow. Got it!)

101
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:48,693
Yeah, we went out to eat that day.

102
00:07:48,873 --> 00:07:51,323
What was my brother like that day?

103
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:54,072
I'm not sure how to answer that question.

104
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,533
Anything helps.

105
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:58,182
Come to think of it,

106
00:07:58,183 --> 00:08:02,083
he didn't have anything to drink because he was meeting a friend later.

107
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:05,833
Do you know who that friend was?

108
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:09,442
No, I didn't ask.

109
00:08:09,443 --> 00:08:10,592
I see.

110
00:08:10,593 --> 00:08:14,692
But if Yamaki-san was meeting a friend,

111
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:16,423
then it was probably Yagi or Kogure-san.

112
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:17,973
Do you know them?

113
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:19,233
No.

114
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:20,813
Then maybe you should meet with them.

115
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:24,302
I'll give you their addresses. Wait here.

116
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,973
Thank you.

117
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:28,993
I'm pretty sure both of them live nearby.

118
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,452
Well, well.

119
00:08:49,453 --> 00:08:51,833
This is the errand Ran-san asked you to run?

120
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,593
Guys...

121
00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:56,652
Uh, I...

122
00:08:56,653 --> 00:08:59,473
Why are you following Risa-oneesan?

123
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:04,393
I was worried if she'd actually return the bracelet to her brother.

124
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:08,302
Risa-san's probably looking for him.

125
00:09:08,303 --> 00:09:09,143
What?

126
00:09:09,563 --> 00:09:11,732
What does that mean?

127
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:14,802
Did she and her brother get into an argument?

128
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:16,783
Is it a case?

129
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:19,352
That must be it.

130
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:21,663
Yeah. After all, Conan-kun thinks it's suspicious.

131
00:09:22,483 --> 00:09:23,913
Crap, Risa-san's gone!

132
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:32,552
Damn it. I lost her.

133
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:35,132
She's missing?

134
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:37,842
Where'd she go?

135
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,673
Do you have any ideas?

136
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:46,933
Risa-san went to meet either her brother's friend Kogure-san or Yagi-san.

137
00:09:47,573 --> 00:09:48,832
Let's split up and look for her.

138
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:49,683
Got it.

139
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,443
I'm sorry to disappoint you after you came all the way here,

140
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:58,733
but I didn't see Yamaki-san that day.

141
00:09:59,143 --> 00:10:00,323
I see.

142
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:05,932
But I don't think you need to be so worried about him.

143
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:10,262
Actually, this was found at a park.

144
00:10:10,263 --> 00:10:12,583
My brother always wore this.

145
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,602
Since this was found,

146
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:19,692
I'm worried my brother may have gotten caught up in something.

147
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:20,922
Have you contacted the police?

148
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:22,593
No, not yet.

149
00:10:23,043 --> 00:10:26,152
I'm going to talk to Kogure-san next.

150
00:10:26,153 --> 00:10:27,223
I was thinking after that.

151
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:32,252
I see. Very well. I'll go with you.

152
00:10:32,253 --> 00:10:34,152
You must feel forlorn on your own.

153
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:37,233
Really? Thank you.

154
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,732
I'll get ready to go right away. Give me a few minutes.

155
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:41,493
Okay.

156
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:44,363
Thank you so much.

157
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:47,743
I'm also worried about Yamaki-san.

158
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:56,392
We can't find her anywhere.

159
00:10:56,393 --> 00:10:57,972
You can do it, Genta-kun.

160
00:10:57,973 --> 00:11:03,223
According to Conan-kun, Yagi-san's house should be around here.

161
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:05,223
Excuse me.

162
00:11:06,443 --> 00:11:08,132
What is it, children?

163
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:12,492
We're looking for the residence of Yagi-san.

164
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:13,853
Do you know where they live, ma'am?

165
00:11:14,163 --> 00:11:17,712
Yagi-san? Oh, Yagi-san.

166
00:11:17,713 --> 00:11:18,733
You know them?

167
00:11:18,993 --> 00:11:22,193
Yes. He lives in this apartment building.

168
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:35,463
Yagi

169
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,963
This is it.

170
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,223
Yes?

171
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,052
Hello!

172
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:48,482
Sorry for dropping in suddenly.

173
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:52,103
Are you Yamaki Shinobu-san's friend Yagi-san?

174
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,402
What? Yes.

175
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:56,103
Hey, wait.

176
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:57,942
Who are you kids?

177
00:11:57,943 --> 00:12:00,452
We're the Detective Boys.

178
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:04,052
We're looking for a lady named Yamaki Risa-san.

179
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:05,743
Did she come here?

180
00:12:06,023 --> 00:12:06,723
What?

181
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:10,243
Risa-san is Yamaki Shinobu-san's younger sister.

182
00:12:10,503 --> 00:12:14,043
She seems to be looking for her brother.

183
00:12:14,363 --> 00:12:18,163
I was at home all day today, but nobody visited me.

184
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:19,923
I see.

185
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:24,423
Then she must be at Kogure's place where Conan went.

186
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:27,062
Now that you know, get out of here.

187
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:28,402
Okay.

188
00:12:28,403 --> 00:12:30,762
Ayumi-chan, let's go.

189
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:31,763
Okay...

190
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:35,663
Sorry I couldn't help.

191
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,442
It's fine. Sorry for interrupting your busy schedule.

192
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:40,343
Later.

193
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:44,022
Jeez.

194
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:46,603
I can't believe those kids are involved, too.

195
00:12:57,763 --> 00:13:01,083
Aw, man. This place was a dead end.

196
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:02,842
Yeah.

197
00:13:02,843 --> 00:13:05,132
Risa-san must be where Conan-kun—

198
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:07,383
Hey, guys. Can you hear me?

199
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,343
Conan-kun, how did things go over there?

200
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:13,753
Risa-san isn't here.

201
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:18,603
According to the neighbors, Kogure-san hasn't been home since this morning.

202
00:13:19,023 --> 00:13:23,092
Risa-san probably headed to Yagi-san's place.

203
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,613
About that...

204
00:13:24,893 --> 00:13:27,382
She didn't come here either.

205
00:13:27,383 --> 00:13:28,572
I see.

206
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:30,242
Hey, Conan-kun.

207
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:33,512
I think Yagi-san is lying.

208
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:34,243
What?

209
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:39,793
I smelled Risa-oneesan at his apartment.

210
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:41,762
Is that true, Ayumi-chan?

211
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:43,883
Yeah, I'm sure I did.

212
00:13:44,263 --> 00:13:47,342
It was the smell of her perfume.

213
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:51,513
Does that mean she was at his place?

214
00:13:52,903 --> 00:13:54,642
Um, Conan-kun?

215
00:13:54,643 --> 00:13:56,013
What is it, Mitsuhiko?

216
00:13:56,243 --> 00:14:00,353
There was something about Yagi-san's apartment that I found odd, too.

217
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:05,022
The shoes were tidily put away in the shoe cabinet at the entrance,

218
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:09,533
except for a pair of boots that seemed to have been sloppily stuffed in there.

219
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:12,422
What do you suppose that means?

220
00:14:12,423 --> 00:14:14,283
Where are you guys right now?

221
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:15,203
What?

222
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:18,142
In front of Yagi-san's apartment building.

223
00:14:18,143 --> 00:14:19,163
Got it.

224
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:22,572
Stay where you are, got it?

225
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:23,782
I'll be right there.

226
00:14:23,783 --> 00:14:25,923
But what about Risa-oneesan?

227
00:14:26,123 --> 00:14:29,923
It's the boots Mitsuhiko said were sloppily put away.

228
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:33,252
What? What about them?

229
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:35,762
Since you guys suddenly showed up,

230
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:41,063
he probably hastily hid Risa-san's shoes inside those boots.

231
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:58,262
Which means...

232
00:14:58,263 --> 00:14:59,173
Yeah.

233
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:01,982
Risa-san is still inside Yagi-san's apartment!

234
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:02,663
What?

235
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:05,842
But why would Yagi-san do that?

236
00:15:05,843 --> 00:15:10,683
Probably because Risa-san brought Yamaki-san's bracelet to him.

237
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:14,303
I found it odd when we visited Yamaki-san's house.

238
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,492
Risa-san didn't live there.

239
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:20,602
Her brother lived there alone.

240
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:22,433
What? Really?

241
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:27,023
There was only a men's umbrella in the stand in the entryway.

242
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:33,493
There was also a wilting houseplant with yellowing leaves.

243
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:39,123
In other words, her brother hasn't been home in a while.

244
00:15:39,483 --> 00:15:41,793
Then why was Risa-oneesan there?

245
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:45,172
She probably went there because she couldn't get in touch with her brother

246
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:47,103
and was worried about him.

247
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,122
But because we returned the bracelet to her,

248
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:55,013
she believed her brother may have gotten swept up in something.

249
00:15:56,203 --> 00:15:59,263
The string on the bracelet was broken, remember?

250
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:05,252
It must've been torn off during an argument with the culprit.

251
00:16:05,253 --> 00:16:10,783
There were tire tracks in the road in front of the park and what looked like bloodstains, too.

252
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:18,573
It was Yagi-san who got into an argument with Risa-san's brother!

253
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:20,222
No way.

254
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,583
Whatever you do, guys, stay where you are!

255
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,083
Don't do anything until I arrive!

256
00:16:26,933 --> 00:16:32,703
This wouldn't have happened to you if this hadn't turned up.

257
00:16:34,213 --> 00:16:36,882
It's your brother's fault.

258
00:16:36,883 --> 00:16:41,572
I had Yamaki-san fork over some money because I had an opportunity to get rich.

259
00:16:41,573 --> 00:16:44,732
But there were some problems, and I lost it all.

260
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:47,603
Yamaki-san was furious when he stormed in.

261
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:52,313
But that's how investments work, you know?

262
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:55,922
Sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose.

263
00:16:55,923 --> 00:16:57,773
That's how investments work.

264
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:02,993
But your brother insisted that I return his money.

265
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,603
I explained repeatedly that I couldn't right away,

266
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:13,753
but he was impatient and said he'd report me to the police.

267
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:17,893
On top of that, he threatened to tell my fiancée.

268
00:17:19,993 --> 00:17:21,233
So I...

269
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:26,313
Don't worry.

270
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:32,102
I'll take you to see your brother tonight.

271
00:17:32,103 --> 00:17:33,692
Good idea.

272
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:35,292
Indeed.

273
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:37,073
We can't wait for Conan-kun.

274
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:38,083
Yeah.

275
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:41,323
We should rescue Risa-oneesan ourselves.

276
00:17:41,683 --> 00:17:47,982
Besides, if I hadn't found that bracelet, this wouldn't have happened.

277
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,862
That's not true.

278
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:51,972
It's Yagi-san who's the bad guy in this situation.

279
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:53,862
That's right, Ayumi.

280
00:17:53,863 --> 00:17:58,883
Besides, if you hadn't found that bracelet, we wouldn't have identified the culprit.

281
00:18:00,103 --> 00:18:01,183
You're right.

282
00:18:02,183 --> 00:18:03,383
Ready?

283
00:18:03,673 --> 00:18:08,762
I'll ring the doorbell, and while Yagi-san is distracted...

284
00:18:08,763 --> 00:18:11,392
I'll jump out from behind the door and tackle him.

285
00:18:11,393 --> 00:18:11,893
Yes.

286
00:18:12,113 --> 00:18:16,023
Then I'll go inside and rescue Risa-oneesan.

287
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,193
The perfect plan, if I say so myself.

288
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,852
We'll settle this case before Conan arrives.

289
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:25,823
I can already see Conan-kun's disappointed expression.

290
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:27,453
Yeah.

291
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:29,953
What is it, Ayumi?

292
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:32,833
Is there a problem with my plan?

293
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:36,333
Behind you. Mitsuhiko-kun, behind you.

294
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:38,353
What? Behind me?

295
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:41,923
I thought I told you kids to leave!

296
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:45,592
Damn it!

297
00:18:45,593 --> 00:18:47,353
Let go of Mitsuhiko!

298
00:18:47,613 --> 00:18:49,042
Shut up!

299
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:53,612
This is what you kids get for playing detective!

300
00:18:53,613 --> 00:18:55,653
Mitsuhiko-kun, close your eyes!

301
00:18:59,663 --> 00:19:00,823
Run, Ayumi!

302
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,073
Damn it. I'll teach those kids to screw with me.

303
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:10,543
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

304
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:14,162
It skipped our floor.

305
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:16,423
What are we going to do, Mitsuhiko?

306
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:19,243
You're asking me?

307
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:23,052
There's another elevator over there.

308
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:24,723
Hurry!

309
00:19:31,143 --> 00:19:32,292
Hurry, hurry!

310
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:33,732
Hurry up!

311
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:36,983
The elevator is still on the first floor.

312
00:19:37,503 --> 00:19:39,443
Hurry, hurry.

313
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:43,573
If you don't hurry, you'll get caught.

314
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:49,743
Hurry!

315
00:19:58,053 --> 00:20:00,303
Too bad.

316
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:05,553
That won't work.

317
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:08,233
The doors won't close while I'm holding them open.

318
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,202
Now then, what should I do with you impudent kids?

319
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:16,043
Get down, guys!

320
00:20:29,923 --> 00:20:31,823
I made it in time.

321
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:40,333
Later, an investigation revealed that the tire marks

322
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:43,073
in front of the park matched the tires of Yagi Keita's car.

323
00:20:43,613 --> 00:20:47,933
The blood left there was also found to be Yamaki Shinobu-san's.

324
00:20:48,443 --> 00:20:50,292
Thank you so much.

325
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:52,803
You saved my life.

326
00:20:54,573 --> 00:20:55,883
Oh, right.

327
00:20:56,963 --> 00:20:57,813
Here.

328
00:20:58,733 --> 00:20:59,813
What is it?

329
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:09,653
Brother...

330
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:14,163
If not for this, my brother's case wouldn't have been solved.

331
00:21:14,863 --> 00:21:21,843
No, he probably wanted it to be solved by you, the Detective Boys.

332
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:27,042
Um, that gemstone is a garnet, isn't it?

333
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:30,433
Yes, that's right. It's my birth stone.

334
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:32,593
My brother always...

335
00:23:08,273 --> 00:23:09,233
Jeez.

336
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:11,892
I kept telling you guys not to go anywhere.

337
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:13,362
Sorry.

338
00:23:13,363 --> 00:23:15,042
But, but, but...

339
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:17,373
The Detective Boys did good this time.

340
00:23:17,953 --> 00:23:19,862
You guys...

341
00:23:19,863 --> 00:23:21,373
Hey, wait.

342
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,253
I just found this over there.

343
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,423
Doesn't this belong to you?

344
00:23:29,953 --> 00:23:31,772
I-Is this...?

345
00:23:31,773 --> 00:23:33,332
A lost item?

346
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,823
Which means...

347
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:39,693
This is a job for the Detective Boys!

348
00:23:40,163 --> 00:23:43,523
They haven't learned their lesson at all.

349
00:23:45,243 --> 00:23:48,693
What? Solve the dine and dashes?

350
00:23:48,943 --> 00:23:51,182
Dad, listen to this.

351
00:23:51,183 --> 00:23:53,263
Just now, at Beika Park...

352
00:23:54,273 --> 00:23:55,313
Shoes?

353
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:02,743
Due to that string of incidents, the smile finally disappeared from her face.

354
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,833
Please solve this case.

355
00:24:07,153 --> 00:24:08,633
I shall.

356
00:24:09,523 --> 00:24:13,583
The next episode of Conan is "The Idol Whose Smile Disappeared!"
