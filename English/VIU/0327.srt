1
00:00:03,313 --> 00:00:05,312
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,313 --> 00:00:07,312
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,313 --> 00:00:08,812
The fragrance of murder

4
00:00:08,813 --> 00:00:11,012
and the blotches of a love affair.

5
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:12,612
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,612
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:16,513
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,732 --> 00:01:57,431
The Morozumi residence

9
00:01:57,432 --> 00:01:58,731
that Hattori, Pops and I went on behalf of Kusukawa,

10
00:01:58,732 --> 00:02:00,731
to investigate caught fire,

11
00:02:00,732 --> 00:02:03,132
and Ryoko Morozumi dies.

12
00:02:04,232 --> 00:02:09,031
Like all the other serial arson sites,

13
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:11,332
a red horse doll is left behind at the site.

14
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:18,331
However, one of the suspects Takanori Genda, admits to the crime,

15
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:20,932
and the case seems to have closed, but...

16
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:29,132
"Red Horse In The Fire (Case Solved)"

17
00:02:31,732 --> 00:02:33,931
Oh, no! It's already 3 pm.

18
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:37,532
I guess we'll just have to forget about Tropical Land.

19
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:43,031
I see.

20
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:46,431
It's true that if we do as you say,

21
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,431
fire could be ignited automatically.

22
00:02:49,432 --> 00:02:51,631
But the burn on that light bulb

23
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:54,932
could be something that coincidentally got there during the fire.

24
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:00,931
If that trick were to be used,

25
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:03,932
any of the three could've done it, couldn't they?

26
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:09,831
The owner of that house, Akira Morozumi, of course.

27
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:12,431
That womanizer Misao Soga,

28
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:14,331
as well as Ryoko's older sister, Keiko Gondo

29
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:18,032
seem to have frequently gone in and out of the house.

30
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:24,331
We came to Mr. Genda's house to find out who the culprit is,

31
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:26,031
so let's hurry and go into the house.

32
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:27,431
Yeah, right.

33
00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:31,931
We may find a diary or something that could be a key to the case.

34
00:03:31,932 --> 00:03:33,332
Gosh.

35
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:38,231
But you don't even have a search warrant

36
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:40,832
and yet you have the keys. It's amazing.

37
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:46,631
I told Genda that I would prove his innocence.

38
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:48,832
Then he broke out in tears and lent it to me.

39
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:54,531
It sure is a big house for Mr. Genda to be living in alone.

40
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:55,631
Yeah.

41
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:59,031
He was living here with his mother after his father passed away,

42
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:02,132
but last year, his mother also passed away of an illness.

43
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:05,131
By the way, Mouri, did you notice

44
00:04:05,132 --> 00:04:07,031
the shoe marks in the corridor?

45
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:10,531
Yes. They're here and there.

46
00:04:10,532 --> 00:04:12,931
The shoe marks of someone...

47
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:15,931
These are Mr. Genda's shoe marks.

48
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:18,831
It's the same as the shoes that's in the shoes cabinet.

49
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:21,931
Which means that Mr. Genda...

50
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:24,631
Hey. Take a look at this.

51
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:27,232
There's something strange in the wastebasket.

52
00:04:30,932 --> 00:04:35,231
A soiled pair of socks and a burnt shirt.

53
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:38,931
If Mr. Genda's sleepwalking habit was getting worse,

54
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:42,231
maybe his saying, "The other me did it",

55
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:44,731
is not all that much of a lie.

56
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:47,131
He's not that kind of a guy.

57
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:49,431
He's not the kind of man

58
00:04:49,432 --> 00:04:51,932
that would set fire to other people's houses.

59
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:55,932
Mr. Yuminaga...

60
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,731
Hey, Kudo!

61
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:02,732
Come here a minute!

62
00:05:04,632 --> 00:05:08,831
It's the telephone bill that was on top of the shoes cabinet.

63
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:11,231
It says 30,000 yen a month.

64
00:05:11,232 --> 00:05:13,031
Isn't it a bit too much?

65
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:17,031
It's true that it's strange for a guy who's living alone, but...

66
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:19,531
Ran also talks to Sonoko for a long time over silly things

67
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:21,432
and the bill totals to about that much.

68
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:25,031
Come to think of it,

69
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:27,331
silly Kazuha does the same thing.

70
00:05:27,332 --> 00:05:30,931
She talks for a long time with my mom.

71
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:34,432
I wonder why women like to talk on the phone so much.

72
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:37,631
Well, I'm so sorry!

73
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:39,931
That our phone calls are so silly!

74
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:40,932
Heiji!

75
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:42,532
Conan!

76
00:05:46,232 --> 00:05:50,331
Don't tell me you guys were eavesdropping from the front door?

77
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:52,631
We wouldn't do something low class like that!

78
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,731
You idiot!

79
00:05:54,732 --> 00:05:56,331
We were listening to the car radio

80
00:05:56,332 --> 00:05:59,231
when we heard you guys talking.

81
00:05:59,232 --> 00:06:01,031
Right?

82
00:06:01,032 --> 00:06:03,232
Radio?

83
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:13,332
It's inside this vase.

84
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:16,931
Here it is! Look!

85
00:06:16,932 --> 00:06:18,431
It's a wiretap.

86
00:06:18,432 --> 00:06:20,031
Huh?

87
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:22,931
That's exactly the same as the vase

88
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:24,831
that is in the front entrance of the Morozumi's, isn't it?

89
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:27,131
We heard other things, too.

90
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:28,932
Something about the wastebasket.

91
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:33,832
Hey, wait!

92
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:39,632
There's got be one near this wastebasket too, a wiretap.

93
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:42,532
A crystal ball?

94
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:45,331
Hattori.

95
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:47,031
I found it.

96
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:50,831
This time inside the cushion under the crystal ball.

97
00:06:50,832 --> 00:06:52,232
I've seen that!

98
00:06:53,532 --> 00:06:56,631
It's the crystal of good luck that the woman fortune-teller

99
00:06:56,632 --> 00:06:58,531
at the building in front of Haido Station is selling.

100
00:06:58,532 --> 00:07:01,932
She's known for being pretty good.

101
00:07:04,232 --> 00:07:06,631
Hey! That small cushion...

102
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:07,731
It's a different color,

103
00:07:07,732 --> 00:07:10,632
but similar to the one Ryoko was holding, don't you think?

104
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,231
Don't tell me...

105
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:15,631
Could it be in here, too?

106
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:17,632
Hey.

107
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:25,931
No.

108
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:28,031
It's not a wiretap.

109
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:31,532
But we found something unbelievable.

110
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:38,231
Yes. The guy, Genda confessed,

111
00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:41,131
but suddenly refused to say anything.

112
00:07:41,132 --> 00:07:45,331
The red horse was indeed handmade by Genda.

113
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:50,331
But he refuses to say anything about the serial arsons.

114
00:07:50,332 --> 00:07:53,131
And we're at Genda's house right now,

115
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:55,931
but can't find any vital evidence.

116
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:59,031
Genda saying that he has a habit of sleepwalking

117
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:01,431
is probably a lie, too.

118
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:03,231
Well, the forensic officers will be here tomorrow,

119
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,231
so I'm sure something will come out.

120
00:08:05,232 --> 00:08:06,531
When something more concerning the investigations come up,

121
00:08:06,532 --> 00:08:08,932
I'll contact you again.

122
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:15,031
Was it okay, sonny?

123
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:17,931
Just great, Inspector!

124
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:20,431
But, what are you up to anyway?

125
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:24,631
Making fake calls like that to all three suspects?

126
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:25,632
Fake calls?

127
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:27,131
They're fake calls, aren't they?

128
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,031
You found wiretaps in the vase at the front entrance

129
00:08:30,032 --> 00:08:31,931
as well as something in the cushion.

130
00:08:31,932 --> 00:08:34,231
There is proof everywhere

131
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:36,131
that Mr. Genda had a habit of sleepwalking.

132
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:39,531
Well, I'll explain everything later.

133
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:42,331
And us being here, too.

134
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:45,031
Won't that make more work for the forensic officers?

135
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:48,931
Yeah. I'm sure our hair is on the floor somewhere, too.

136
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:52,931
Then, what should we do to erase all evidence that we were here?

137
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,631
What should we do?

138
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:56,531
Go all out and clean the place, what else?

139
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:59,831
If you didn't have time to do so, then what?

140
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,532
Well...

141
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:04,532
Maybe...

142
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:33,932
Hey.

143
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:39,431
Aren't you forgetting to leave this red horse behind?

144
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,432
Mr. Arsonist.

145
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:57,646
Or, should I say...

146
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:03,645
Mr. Morozumi.

147
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:05,045
Yeah.

148
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:07,945
This key holder of the red horse that Mr. Genda made

149
00:12:07,946 --> 00:12:09,945
was the start of everything.

150
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:14,145
This red horse that is supposed to bring prosperous business.

151
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:18,145
I don't know what caused the first fire in Rizencho,

152
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:20,845
but this horse was found at the site of the fire

153
00:12:20,846 --> 00:12:25,745
because the owner of the house was a good customer of Mr. Genda's store.

154
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:30,845
Mr. Genda probably gave that person this key holder inside a box.

155
00:12:30,846 --> 00:12:33,945
But before the person opened the box, the house caught fire.

156
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:35,645
The box and Guan Yu both burned

157
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:38,045
leaving behind only the Red Rabbit Horse.

158
00:12:38,046 --> 00:12:39,345
Of course, the owner of the house

159
00:12:39,346 --> 00:12:41,345
would have no knowledge of the horse.

160
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:45,645
And "Red Horse" is a code word for the police meaning arsonist.

161
00:12:45,646 --> 00:12:47,045
So, the press began making a fuss writing articles

162
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:49,346
such as "The Start of a Series of Arsons".

163
00:12:50,346 --> 00:12:51,745
On the other hand,

164
00:12:51,746 --> 00:12:53,345
Mr. Genda who was shocked at hearing the person saying,

165
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:55,945
she knew nothing about the horse that he gave her...

166
00:12:55,946 --> 00:12:58,645
got worried that maybe his sleepwalking habit

167
00:12:58,646 --> 00:13:00,645
when he was a child had reoccurred again,

168
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,845
and went to your hospital,

169
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:05,945
where he was taken advantage of.

170
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:08,645
And when you heard Genda's story, you made him believe that

171
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:12,545
he was a sleepwalker who had a habit of committing arsons,

172
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:16,045
and took note of the fact that the first fire occurred in 1-chome.

173
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,645
Then after, you set fire to 2-chome and 3-chome in order.

174
00:13:19,646 --> 00:13:22,245
You burned your house on 4-chome,

175
00:13:22,246 --> 00:13:25,246
and killed your wife, Ryoko.

176
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:29,145
You cut the Guan Yu and stand off the key holder

177
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:31,245
and left the red horse at the site of the fire

178
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:33,545
to make it look like the serial arsonist did it,

179
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:37,145
and framed Mr. Genda up as the arsonist.

180
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:39,845
You made a spare key for this house

181
00:13:39,846 --> 00:13:41,945
and snuck in here night after night

182
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,545
to corner Mr. Genda up against the wall.

183
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:47,245
You left shoe prints,

184
00:13:47,246 --> 00:13:50,345
burnt shirts and dirty socks in his room

185
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:54,345
to make him come under the illusion that he was the arsonist.

186
00:13:54,346 --> 00:13:58,545
But Mr. Genda came of his own initiative to my hospital

187
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,045
saying that he had a habit of sleepwalking.

188
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:04,945
But that's when he was a child, right?

189
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:06,545
I saw on TV that there are many cases

190
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,945
when a nervous child unable to cope with all the excitement

191
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:13,346
during the day sleepwalks around his sleeping quarters at night.

192
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:16,645
A psychiatrist should know something like that

193
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:18,845
right off the bat, no?

194
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:21,845
But Mr. Genda was loitering around nearby

195
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:24,445
when my house caught fire, wasn't he?

196
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,545
I would never know something like that,

197
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:28,146
even if I were his doctor, would I?

198
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:34,145
You heard Genda and Soga talking on the phone, didn't you?

199
00:14:34,146 --> 00:14:37,645
With the wiretap that you set up inside the underside of the telephone

200
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:40,345
that you took out a while ago.

201
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,545
After hearing Soga say, "If you go to the houses on that day,

202
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:44,245
your fortune will take a turn for the better."

203
00:14:44,246 --> 00:14:47,146
You picked the date to set fire.

204
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:51,145
All you had to do was change the beckoning cat key holder Genda

205
00:14:51,146 --> 00:14:53,345
was supposed to pass out to the neighborhood that day,

206
00:14:53,346 --> 00:14:55,745
to the Red Rabbit Horse.

207
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:58,345
You knew that Mr. Genda would come to retrieve the key holders

208
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:00,945
when he finds out that he had passed out the wrong ones and that,

209
00:15:00,946 --> 00:15:05,545
the people would become suspicious at seeing him do this.

210
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:08,645
Since it was the day that Ryoko had called the detective,

211
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,745
you figured that if things worked out well,

212
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:12,845
the detective would remember Genda.

213
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,245
Please wait!

214
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:18,245
The fire was set at past 7:30 pm, right?

215
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:21,245
I went out to drink with Mr. Soga before 7:30 pm,

216
00:15:21,246 --> 00:15:24,245
and he also testified to this.

217
00:15:24,246 --> 00:15:26,845
Or, are you saying that the boy next door

218
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:29,745
who testified to the time of the arson is lying?

219
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:32,945
Huh? What's this?

220
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:36,745
The tissue paper is wrapped around the light bulb and taped on.

221
00:15:36,746 --> 00:15:40,145
And there's something poked in between the tissue paper, too.

222
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:42,445
Wait!

223
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:44,445
It's a match!

224
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:46,945
The surface temperature of a light bulb of 100 watts

225
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,645
is 218 degrees.

226
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:50,045
Wrapping tissue paper around something like that

227
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:52,545
and moreover, poking a match between it.

228
00:15:52,546 --> 00:15:53,746
It's not hard to figure out what will happen, is it?

229
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:58,645
In other words, it's a time-igniting device

230
00:15:58,646 --> 00:16:01,545
to set fire to your house

231
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:04,345
while you are out drinking with Mr. Soga.

232
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:08,045
You did the same thing to the light bulb in the storeroom,

233
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:09,645
poured kerosene on the floor

234
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:12,445
and stuck a red horse between the window beforehand.

235
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:13,745
Then, before you went out drinking with Mr. Soga,

236
00:16:13,746 --> 00:16:15,945
you turned on the light.

237
00:16:15,946 --> 00:16:19,445
So, 10 minutes later, the match would ignite,

238
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,946
the tissue paper would fall to the ground and fire would break out.

239
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:24,445
Then, the boy next door

240
00:16:24,446 --> 00:16:27,845
as usual watches TV with the room dark.

241
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:30,145
When the tissue is wrapped around the light bulb,

242
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:31,745
the light is still weak,

243
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:33,945
so the silhouette of the horse will not project.

244
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:36,045
But after the tissue paper burns off,

245
00:16:36,046 --> 00:16:38,045
the silhouette of the horse is projected

246
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:41,545
as if the arsonist had left the horse behind at that time.

247
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:43,345
Next, you were probably planning to sneak in here

248
00:16:43,346 --> 00:16:47,545
and burn this place down to erase traces of you having been here.

249
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:50,045
But there is still other evidence.

250
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:51,745
It's the stand of the key holder

251
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:53,245
with the words "Red Rabbit Horse" on it

252
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,246
that Ryoko was holding on to at the time she died.

253
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:58,345
The cut part matched the leg of the horse

254
00:16:58,346 --> 00:17:01,545
that was left back at the fire site on 3-chome.

255
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:03,945
Now, all that needs to be done is to see

256
00:17:03,946 --> 00:17:07,645
if the fingerprints that are on it match your fingerprints.

257
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:10,045
You cut off the stand and Guan Yu

258
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:12,845
because you didn't want anyone to know it was what Mr. Genda had made.

259
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:18,745
You didn't want him to get caught before you kill Ryoko.

260
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,845
It seems she knew what you were up to though.

261
00:17:22,846 --> 00:17:24,945
She probably asked the detective to come and investigate

262
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:28,845
the suspicious person loitering around at night,

263
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:29,846
but found out that it was you,

264
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:33,845
experimenting on the trick in the storeroom.

265
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:36,445
After realizing it was you,

266
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:38,045
she checked your belongings

267
00:17:38,046 --> 00:17:40,345
and found the red horse and the stand,

268
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:44,145
and was convinced that the serial arsonist was you.

269
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,445
She probably asked us to leave

270
00:17:46,446 --> 00:17:48,745
because she was planning to threaten you to...

271
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:50,245
Right!

272
00:17:50,246 --> 00:17:53,245
She threatened to divorce me and kick me out of this house!

273
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:54,545
All I wanted to do was

274
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:57,546
burn the house and build a hospital.

275
00:17:58,246 --> 00:17:59,845
Hey, hey.

276
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,945
Only if this stand wasn't found!

277
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:04,845
If I didn't get deceived into a trap like this!

278
00:18:04,846 --> 00:18:07,545
This was supposed to be a perfect crime!

279
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:11,545
You idiot. We knew from before you came here.

280
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:12,845
Don't lie!

281
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:15,145
Soga could've done it, and so could Ryoko's older sister!

282
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:16,245
Yeah.

283
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:19,545
Those two also sold objects with wiretaps in them to Genda

284
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:21,445
and were wiretapping him.

285
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:24,245
They probably wanted him to believe in Feng Shui

286
00:18:24,246 --> 00:18:27,445
and fortune-telling by telling him stuff only he alone knew,

287
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:30,845
and sell him more expensive stuff.

288
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:35,945
We found out from the telephone bill that the phone was wiretapped.

289
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:38,345
When you wiretap using the telephone line,

290
00:18:38,346 --> 00:18:40,945
it has to be connected all the while

291
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:43,945
so the telephone bill sky-rockets.

292
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:47,445
So, how can you tell that I'm the one who set it up?

293
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:51,445
It could be either one of the two!

294
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:53,145
You still don't realize?

295
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:54,745
Huh?

296
00:18:54,746 --> 00:18:57,345
You understand that in order to set up a wiretap in the phone,

297
00:18:57,346 --> 00:19:01,545
you have to sneak into the house, right?

298
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:02,945
Yeah.

299
00:19:02,946 --> 00:19:06,545
As for the other two, if they were to sneak into the house,

300
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,245
they would first of all remove the wiretap

301
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:11,545
from the things that they sold Mr. Genda,

302
00:19:11,546 --> 00:19:14,546
because otherwise, they'd be suspected.

303
00:19:18,446 --> 00:19:22,345
You probably came across committing this crime

304
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:25,545
after reading Agatha Christie's "The ABC Murders",

305
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:29,445
but why didn't you realize then

306
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:31,645
that no matter how hard you think out the plan,

307
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:34,545
the one who gets to laugh at the end is not the killer,

308
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:38,146
but the old man with the gray brain.

309
00:19:53,746 --> 00:19:56,545
See you then, Mouri. Thanks for everything.

310
00:19:56,546 --> 00:19:58,645
No, not at all.

311
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:00,645
No. Rather...

312
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:02,246
maybe I should be thanking these boys?

313
00:20:05,346 --> 00:20:08,446
By the way, what will become of those two?

314
00:20:09,946 --> 00:20:12,345
Well, it's not that they sold

315
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:14,245
something outrageously expensive to Genda yet,

316
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,845
and all they did was sneak in to collect their wiretaps

317
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:19,445
because they didn't want to be suspected as arsonists, so...

318
00:20:19,446 --> 00:20:22,845
We'll let them go after we give them a good lecture at the station.

319
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:28,945
Tell me. Why did you believe Genda was innocent?

320
00:20:28,946 --> 00:20:30,245
Yeah.

321
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:33,145
When Genda came up as a suspect,

322
00:20:33,146 --> 00:20:35,946
I called him out to the park and talked to him.

323
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:39,845
I stayed with him for 30 minutes, but he hardly talked.

324
00:20:39,846 --> 00:20:41,845
So, we decided to talk again some other time

325
00:20:41,846 --> 00:20:45,045
and I got up from the bench.

326
00:20:45,046 --> 00:20:47,145
I turned to look back at him from a distance,

327
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:49,145
and saw him looking desperately for something

328
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:52,345
in the grassy area around the bench.

329
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:57,845
It began raining a little while after he left the bench.

330
00:20:57,846 --> 00:21:00,145
After seeing the look of relief on his face,

331
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:03,645
I finally understood

332
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:05,545
that he was looking for the cigarette butt

333
00:21:05,546 --> 00:21:08,845
that I threw down on the ground.

334
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:12,746
Because that was what caused the fire that took his father's life.

335
00:21:14,846 --> 00:21:17,345
I just couldn't believe that a guy like him

336
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:19,045
could set fire to anybody's house.

337
00:21:19,046 --> 00:21:21,245
Neither did I want believe he could.

338
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,146
It's as simple as that.

339
00:21:25,546 --> 00:21:27,546
See you, Mouri!

340
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:30,446
Yes, sir!

341
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:06,545
Hey, come on. A little cheaper!

342
00:23:06,546 --> 00:23:10,345
I came all the way here to buy from you to cheer you up, you know?

343
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:14,345
But that watch is made by a famous craftsman.

344
00:23:14,346 --> 00:23:16,145
No matter how famous,

345
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,145
if it doesn't move unless you wind it,

346
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:22,945
it's practically useless in this day and age, right?

347
00:23:22,946 --> 00:23:24,545
But...

348
00:23:24,546 --> 00:23:27,645
Okay! Give me this too and a 500 yen discount.

349
00:23:27,646 --> 00:23:28,945
How's about it?

350
00:23:28,946 --> 00:23:30,545
Heiji, we better hurry

351
00:23:30,546 --> 00:23:32,645
or we won't make it in time for the plane going back home.

352
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:35,145
Come on, mister. Hurry and wrap it up, will you?

353
00:23:35,146 --> 00:23:37,345
Simple wrapping will do.

354
00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:39,745
-Yes. Thank you very much! -Hey, Kazuha!

355
00:23:39,746 --> 00:23:41,745
Never mind giving him a discount already,

356
00:23:41,746 --> 00:23:45,345
so can you give me this antique jewelry for free?

357
00:23:45,346 --> 00:23:47,245
What?

358
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:49,545
Okay, mister?

359
00:23:49,546 --> 00:23:52,645
No, no way!

360
00:23:52,646 --> 00:23:56,045
Are you guys really trying to cheer him up or what?

361
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:58,046
Please, mister!

362
00:24:00,546 --> 00:24:03,546
"Next Episode"

363
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:08,546
Oh, this is really good!

364
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:17,645
Ran! Get the ambulance!

365
00:24:17,646 --> 00:24:19,746
-Okay! -Get the police, too!

366
00:24:20,946 --> 00:24:24,146
Stay back! Don't touch anything on the table!

367
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:30,446
