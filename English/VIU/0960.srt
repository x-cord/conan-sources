1
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,856
Hey! Coming your way, Haibara!

2
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:08,776
Huh?

3
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:11,145
What are you doing?

4
00:00:11,146 --> 00:00:14,185
It's your fault for kicking it someplace weird!

5
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:15,156
Who, me?

6
00:00:15,156 --> 00:00:16,096
Yes!

7
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:19,115
Ai-chan, I'll go get it.

8
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:21,156
Thanks, Yoshida-san.

9
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:41,245
Yoshida-san.

10
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:42,865
What's the matter?

11
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:44,166
That woman...

12
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:49,095
She seems sort of sad.

13
00:00:49,096 --> 00:00:49,856
Yeah.

14
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:52,826
Hey, someone's coming.

15
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:57,106
I see. She's been waiting for him.

16
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:00,816
Doesn't look that way.

17
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:03,745
Is she waiting for someone?

18
00:01:03,746 --> 00:01:05,725
Does it matter?

19
00:01:05,726 --> 00:01:07,785
I'm curious.

20
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:11,496
A beautiful woman is drinking alone in a park.

21
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,665
There must be some reason for it.

22
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,735
Let's ask her what she's doing.

23
00:01:15,736 --> 00:01:17,115
I agree!

24
00:01:17,116 --> 00:01:19,006
Guys!

25
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,006
Jeez. Sticking their noses where they don't belong again...

26
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,636
Komori Tomoko (35) Widow

27
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:26,776
Hey.

28
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,016
What are you doing?

29
00:01:29,706 --> 00:01:32,915
Who, me?

30
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:36,185
Why are you drinking alone in the park?

31
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:39,526
Oh, you saw me. How embarrassing.

32
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:43,406
Why do you have two glasses when you're alone in—

33
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:50,265
I-I didn't mean anything by it.

34
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:51,495
Don't cry.

35
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:53,416
Ma'am, are you okay?

36
00:01:53,676 --> 00:01:54,896
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:57,545
The tears came when I remembered.

38
00:01:57,546 --> 00:01:59,426
What did you remember?

39
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:01,736
My beloved...

40
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:07,426
He died...

41
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:13,076
What are we supposed to do about this?

42
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:16,885
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness!

43
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,945
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills!

44
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:20,025
A woman drinking alone...

45
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:22,635
What drama awaits behind those tears?

46
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:24,075
Always determining the one truth

47
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:25,945
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

48
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,326
his name is Detective Conan!

49
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:15,685
Miss Lonely and the Detective Boys

50
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:18,186
Sasagokita Botanical Garden

51
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,666
How pretty.

52
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:29,215
There are all kinds of flowers blooming.

53
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:30,916
I'm impressed.

54
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:32,755
Let's go over there.

55
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:33,716
Okay.

56
00:04:33,717 --> 00:04:36,095
Hey, wait!

57
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:37,766
Guys!

58
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:41,846
How nice. They have so much energy.

59
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:44,716
By the way, Tomoko-san, are you sure this is okay?

60
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:48,215
You brought us to this botanical garden.

61
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:53,106
It's fine. Spending the weekend alone was boring anyway.

62
00:04:53,386 --> 00:04:55,625
Tomoko-san, come here!

63
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:57,886
Wait! I'll be right there!

64
00:04:58,276 --> 00:05:00,975
But is this really for the best?

65
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:06,166
Well, I doubt she has time to be sad while handling those kids.

66
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:08,126
Maybe it's good for her.

67
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:09,796
Yeah.

68
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:13,585
I wasn't sure what would happen when she started crying in the park,

69
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:15,435
but maybe it turned out all right.

70
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:16,386
Yeah.

71
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:17,886
It's an emergency!

72
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:20,385
We can't find Ayumi-chan!

73
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,516
What?

74
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:24,095
There is a lost child in the park.

75
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:28,866
The friends of Yoshida Ayumi-chan, a girl dressed in red, are looking for her.

76
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:33,966
Please come to the information center if you have any information.

77
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:37,026
Information Sasagokita Botanical Garden

78
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:39,835
She'll be found right away.

79
00:05:39,836 --> 00:05:41,406
Thank you.

80
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:47,416
It's okay. I'm sure she's fine.

81
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:50,166
Excuse me.

82
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:54,186
I think this is the lost girl from the announcement just now.

83
00:05:54,806 --> 00:05:55,826
Ayumi-chan!

84
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:58,675
Conan-kun, Ai-chan!

85
00:05:58,676 --> 00:05:59,965
Ayumi-chan!

86
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:02,305
Ai-chan, I was so scared!

87
00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:03,925
There, there.

88
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:04,896
Excuse me.

89
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:09,056
Thank you so much.

90
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,855
It's fine. I'm just glad your daughter is all right.

91
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:14,755
Oh, she's not mine.

92
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:15,396
What?

93
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:19,406
They're friends. I don't have any children.

94
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:22,026
Oh, excuse me.

95
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:24,115
It's fine.

96
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:26,455
You must like kids.

97
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:27,536
Yes.

98
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,536
So do I.

99
00:06:33,486 --> 00:06:34,426
Well, goodbye.

100
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:35,046
Goodbye.

101
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:39,435
Now that I'm relieved, I'm hungry.

102
00:06:39,436 --> 00:06:40,906
Perfect timing.

103
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:43,556
Why don't we have lunch together?

104
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:45,745
I'd like to thank you.

105
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:48,505
I'm terribly sorry, but I don't think I can.

106
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:48,976
Come on.

107
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:50,096
Let's go.

108
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:51,396
Um...

109
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:53,735
Is this okay?

110
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:55,075
Why wouldn't it be?

111
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:57,415
Come on. Let's go, everyone!

112
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,856
Okay!

113
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:03,946
Kajiki Kohei-san, you're a company president?

114
00:07:04,296 --> 00:07:07,555
I manufacture and sell men's cosmetics.

115
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:08,826
I see.

116
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:11,105
What are mech prosthetics?

117
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:13,706
It's men's cosmetics, Genta-kun.

118
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:16,375
It's makeup for men.

119
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:20,546
In this day and age, men need to take proper care of their appearance, too.

120
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:24,545
Kajiki-san, do you often come to botanical gardens?

121
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:25,526
Yes.

122
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:28,435
I said the same thing in a magazine interview the other day,

123
00:07:28,436 --> 00:07:31,936
but I love the outdoors and frequently go on walks alone.

124
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:35,686
I love exercise, too. I even play soccer.

125
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:39,446
Really? We're good at soccer, too.

126
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:42,675
Should we play a game sometime?

127
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:44,855
Bring it on!

128
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:48,765
By the way, Kajiki-san, do you have a girlfriend?

129
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:50,706
What? Oh, um...

130
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:53,175
Well, I...

131
00:07:53,176 --> 00:07:55,545
I'm curious, too.

132
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:57,135
Do you?

133
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:59,835
Embarrassingly, not at this time.

134
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:03,415
Oh, my. In that case, what kind of women do you like?

135
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,846
Aw, jeez.

136
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:09,346
Several Days Later

137
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:13,286
Hey, mister! Coming your way!

138
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:15,686
Yeah, sure.

139
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:19,335
Hey, quit spacing out!

140
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:20,856
Oh, sorry.

141
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:26,235
Hey! Ball's coming your way, mister!

142
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:28,025
Okay.

143
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:31,705
Does Tomoko-san seem totally different to you?

144
00:08:31,706 --> 00:08:33,866
She's pursuing him in her own way.

145
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:36,415
Huh? What does that mean?

146
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:41,295
What? I mean Tomoko-san is trying to match Kajiki-san's tastes.

147
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:43,785
But why?

148
00:08:43,786 --> 00:08:44,676
Idiot.

149
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,825
Wow!

150
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:48,835
That looks delicious!

151
00:08:48,836 --> 00:08:50,926
What a broad variety!

152
00:08:53,596 --> 00:08:54,995
It's good!

153
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:57,296
Really? That's great.

154
00:08:57,726 --> 00:08:59,656
You've got food on your face.

155
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:01,566
Thanks.

156
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:07,425
Um, Kajiki-san, do you like it?

157
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:10,196
Oh, yes. Very much.

158
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:14,206
Really? That's good.

159
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:21,456
I'm delighted there are meatballs in this lunch. They're my favorite.

160
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:29,036
I was thinking how happy I would be if I could eat like this every day.

161
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:31,895
Oh, uh...

162
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:34,065
Is that a proposal?

163
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:36,185
No, I didn't mean it like that.

164
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:41,096
I mean, not entirely, but, uh...

165
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:45,146
Several Days Later

166
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:47,405
What are we doing today? Soccer again?

167
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:50,775
Since she invited us to her house, I doubt that.

168
00:09:50,776 --> 00:09:52,696
I want to play cards.

169
00:09:52,986 --> 00:09:55,856
Why are you coming with us, Professor?

170
00:09:56,306 --> 00:10:01,385
Since she's been looking after you kids, I thought I should thank her.

171
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:05,075
Are you sure you didn't come because you heard Tomoko-san is beautiful?

172
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:07,606
That might be a factor.

173
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:14,025
Anyway, this place is huge.

174
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:16,645
Does she live here alone?

175
00:10:16,646 --> 00:10:20,726
Before her husband passed away, it was probably the two of them.

176
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:25,405
Who is it?

177
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:27,106
Oh, uh...

178
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:29,405
It's Professor Agasa.

179
00:10:29,406 --> 00:10:33,986
I'm something like a guardian to these kids.

180
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:36,265
Oh, is that right?

181
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:38,625
Please come in.

182
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:40,496
Excuse the intrusion!

183
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:42,995
Kajiki-san's here, too.

184
00:10:42,996 --> 00:10:47,506
Yes. Kohei-san is waiting inside for all of you.

185
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:57,636
I invited you here today because I have something to tell you.

186
00:10:57,946 --> 00:11:02,006
Didn't I tell you? She's not single anymore.

187
00:11:03,636 --> 00:11:06,715
By the way, where is Kajiki-san?

188
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:08,276
On the third floor terrace.

189
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:12,276
We were eating and chatting together just now.

190
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:16,786
Afterwards we had a drink, and he began to feel tired.

191
00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:19,866
He having a bit of a nap at the moment.

192
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:23,185
Your phone is ringing.

193
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:24,546
It's not mine.

194
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:29,076
It's not mine either.

195
00:11:30,176 --> 00:11:31,046
We're here.

196
00:11:31,326 --> 00:11:33,366
Then whose phone is—

197
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:43,896
What?!

198
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:46,305
Wasn't that...?

199
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:46,896
Could it be?

200
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:01,959
The deceased is Kajiki Kohei-san, forty-five years old.

201
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:05,709
He was the president of a men's cosmetics company.

202
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,418
What's the cause of death?

203
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:11,518
A cerebral contusion resulting from a fall.

204
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,969
He seems to have fallen from there.

205
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:18,339
Are you the owner of the house?

206
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:20,729
Yes.

207
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:24,739
Forgive me, but what was your relationship with Kajiki-san?

208
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:28,698
He and I were in a romantic relationship.

209
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:30,778
You were dating?

210
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:31,739
Yes.

211
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:35,828
We met and began dating quite recently.

212
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:37,739
He proposed to me today.

213
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:39,308
Today?

214
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:42,868
He'd asked me before,

215
00:12:42,869 --> 00:12:46,699
but I had just lost my husband.

216
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:51,159
Judging by the situation, foul play seems unlikely.

217
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:54,328
We can't be sure yet.

218
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:55,339
Excuse me.

219
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:57,259
This was an accident.

220
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:59,358
We saw it happen.

221
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:00,169
What?

222
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,628
We're not lying.

223
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:06,019
When we came to the terrace, Kajiki-san tripped and fell.

224
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:17,128
He fell from here?

225
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,779
It seems that way.

226
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:21,688
You and Kajiki-san were drinking here?

227
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:22,589
Yes.

228
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,789
How much did you drink?

229
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,908
I didn't have that much.

230
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:30,938
But he had enough to get drunk and fall asleep.

231
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:32,669
Look at this.

232
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:34,669
A phone?

233
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:38,179
That must be Kohei-san's.

234
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:41,238
What's the victim's phone doing here?

235
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,989
I figured it out.

236
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:45,508
Figured out what?

237
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:48,809
Why Kohei-san fell.

238
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:50,248
Seriously?

239
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:55,189
Yes. Kohei-san received a call after getting drunk and falling sleep.

240
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:02,178
Woken by his ringtone, he hurriedly tried to answer his phone.

241
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:06,079
However, his hand slipped, and he dropped his phone.

242
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:11,168
He got up to collect his phone from around the edge,

243
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:13,709
but because he was drunk, he tripped.

244
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:17,218
Because the railing he grabbed onto was rotten,

245
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:20,089
he unfortunately fell from the terrace.

246
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:28,389
Based on the victim's blood alcohol concentration, we know he was drunk.

247
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:33,229
It's possible he tripped on this step, too.

248
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,829
It's my fault for leaving him alone.

249
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:42,298
It's not your fault, Tomoko-san.

250
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,238
That's right. It was an accident.

251
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:46,849
I'm sorry. Thank you.

252
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:48,749
What's this?

253
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:51,499
Looks like a contact lens.

254
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:54,688
It must've been the victim's.

255
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:58,378
The body only had a contact in one eye.

256
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:01,538
Maybe he dropped it when he rubbed his eyes.

257
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:03,389
Probably.

258
00:15:03,729 --> 00:15:06,408
Since we haven't found anything suspicious,

259
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:08,729
it seems likely that his death was accidental.

260
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:13,648
What are you doing, Genta-kun?

261
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:16,529
Sorry. I was thirsty.

262
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:18,719
Don't worry about it.

263
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:26,829
I'll get something to wipe it up.

264
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:40,029
I see. So that's how it is.

265
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:42,418
Hey, Professor.

266
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:44,469
What is it?

267
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:49,968
We'll be leaving now.

268
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:51,839
Wait one minute.

269
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:54,648
What is it, Agasa-san?

270
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:56,859
This wasn't an accident.

271
00:15:57,369 --> 00:16:00,808
Kajiki-san didn't fall by accident.

272
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:04,369
He was made to do so.

273
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:06,808
You're saying he was murdered?

274
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:07,869
That's right.

275
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:10,869
Look closely at his phone.

276
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:14,649
There isn't a scratch on it even though it was dropped on the ground.

277
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:18,379
There aren't any dents or scratches.

278
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:23,958
Isn't it possible that Kajiki-san's phone was on the ground near the railing

279
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:28,389
not because he dropped it, but because someone put it there?

280
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:30,638
Someone?

281
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,639
Who do you mean?

282
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:37,289
There's only one person who had full access to this house.

283
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:42,908
Even if she left his phone by the railing,

284
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:46,739
surely that wasn't enough to make him fall.

285
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:50,099
That's not the only thing she did.

286
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:57,748
She used an illusion to make Kajiki-san trip and fall.

287
00:16:57,749 --> 00:17:01,009
An illusion? What illusion?

288
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:05,758
She made his phone appear to be floating in front of the step.

289
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,448
His phone?

290
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:09,759
Is that possible?

291
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:16,508
I'll recreate it for you using this spray bottle that was in the hallway.

292
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:18,289
A-A spray bottle?

293
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:22,399
First, place the phone on the step near the edge.

294
00:17:22,989 --> 00:17:28,229
Then use this to wet the floor away from the phone.

295
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,288
You're right. It looks like the phone is floating.

296
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:34,798
I see.

297
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,768
When the drunk victim saw this, even if he thought it seemed strange...

298
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:44,889
He might accept it as the truth without thinking too hard about it.

299
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,228
Right?

300
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:52,309
But the key to this illusion isn't that the phone appeared to be floating,

301
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:56,549
but that the phone appeared to be in front of the step.

302
00:17:57,689 --> 00:17:59,788
What do you mean?

303
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:03,319
In other words, woken by his phone's ringtone,

304
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:05,818
because of the illusion,

305
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:11,829
Kohei-san thought he could reach his phone before he hit the step.

306
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:17,688
Believing he was safe, he went to pick up his phone without much care.

307
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:22,588
But his phone was actually on top of the step.

308
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:26,839
He misjudged the situation and tripped on the step before he could reach his phone

309
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:32,629
and fell from the terrace.

310
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:37,588
Because this illusion vanishes once the ground dries,

311
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:40,748
it also has the benefit of leaving no trace.

312
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:41,859
I see.

313
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:46,288
The railing was probably rotted beforehand

314
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:48,409
and made to break at the slightest touch.

315
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:51,869
Do you have any proof?

316
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:53,869
Of course.

317
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:56,869
What proof is there?

318
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:02,249
Kajiki-san used foundation to cover his wrinkles, didn't he?

319
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:05,828
A contact was missing from the body,

320
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:08,698
but there were no signs that he rubbed around his eyes.

321
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:14,879
However, there was something that looked like fingerprints on his upper and lower eyelids.

322
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:18,269
We did find those.

323
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:23,658
No one would open their eyes to remove just one of their contacts.

324
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:29,109
It's only natural to assume someone opened them for him and removed one.

325
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:33,698
And when Genta-kun spilled the water earlier,

326
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:36,858
you changed your mind about removing your handkerchief from your pocket.

327
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:42,789
Perhaps the foundation you wiped from your fingers is still on that handkerchief.

328
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:45,669
But why would she do that?

329
00:19:45,989 --> 00:19:50,198
Because a large difference in acuity between your two eyes disrupts your depth perception,

330
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,398
increasing your risk of falling.

331
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,418
When combined with the illusion,

332
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:58,289
it became extremely likely that Kohei-san would trip over the step.

333
00:19:58,979 --> 00:20:03,518
There's most likely foundation on Komori-san's handkerchief

334
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:09,189
and the phone used to call Kajiki-san's somewhere in this house.

335
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:13,319
Komori-san, do you have anything to say?

336
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:19,279
And could we examine your handkerchief and the inside of your house?

337
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:23,329
It was going so well, too.

338
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:25,508
Tomoko-san?

339
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:26,839
Stay away from me!

340
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:29,529
Tomoko-san, what's gotten into you?

341
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:34,528
You've ruined my masterful performance.

342
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:39,009
I hate little kids like you!

343
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:43,889
So you were using the children from the start.

344
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:45,758
That's right.

345
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,229
He said in a magazine interview that he liked kids.

346
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:55,638
In order to catch a big fish, you need to catch some little ones first.

347
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:57,738
Hey, check this out!

348
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:00,239
I-I-In this room...

349
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:04,689
What is all this?

350
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,249
Surely not all of them, right?

351
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:14,868
My plans were ruined because of you.

352
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:19,259
Komori Tomoko-san, you can tell us the rest at the station.

353
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:22,769
I'll tell you,

354
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:27,989
but I doubt you'll understand.

355
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:57,188
What an unpleasant case.

356
00:22:57,189 --> 00:23:01,739
It seems like she was committing the same crime over and over.

357
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,748
She was an insane criminal.

358
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:07,748
I suppose you can't judge a person by their looks.

359
00:23:07,749 --> 00:23:11,799
Hey, I wonder what she's doing.

360
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,678
Maybe she's rescuing a cat.

361
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,879
But I don't see any sign of a cat.

362
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:21,889
Let's go ask her what she's doing.

363
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:23,708
You're right.

364
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:28,408
There must be some reason a woman is climbing a tree alone.

365
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:29,888
Don't.

366
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:32,058
But aren't you curious?

367
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:33,258
I am!

368
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:34,649
Let's go check it out!

369
00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:36,439
Hey!

370
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:42,918
They're already gone.

371
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:43,819
They sure are.

372
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:47,368
Episode Preview

373
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:48,659
Wow!

374
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:52,169
This is called glamping instead of camping, isn't it?

375
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:56,458
He's dressed like a woman, has sloppy scribbles on his face,

376
00:23:56,459 --> 00:24:00,169
a crab leg in his mouth, and a note in his hand.

377
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:02,049
I didn't do this.

378
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:05,259
There's more.

379
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:09,978
Now I'm ready to go.

380
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:14,399
The next episode of Conan is "The Glamping Mystery!"
