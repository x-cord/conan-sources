1
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:11,339
How wonderful!

2
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:18,339
It's like a festival.

3
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:21,338
They're launching these fireworks

4
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:24,538
to celebrate Ms. Anna's birthday, right?

5
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,938
That's amazing.

6
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,338
Ms. Anna's dog food company, Happywow,

7
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:34,738
is experiencing explosive growth right now.

8
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,339
A couple hundred fireworks are nothing to her.

9
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:43,238
Mr. Kogoro!

10
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:45,938
Ms. Anna!

11
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:47,038
Ran!

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,138
"Anna Hinomiya (24), Happywow President" -Conan!

13
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:52,838
-Ms. Anna! -Ms. Anna!

14
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:55,538
It's 8 pm already.

15
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:59,839
Ms. Anna, we'll be right there!

16
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:03,639
Congratulations, president.

17
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,138
Thank you.

18
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:10,639
I appreciate it.

19
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,538
"Machiko Enami (31)" -You went through a lot to get here,

20
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:17,738
"Happywow Director" -but this is the best time of your life.

21
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:23,238
It's all thanks to you, Machiko and VP Inamura.

22
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:25,238
"Koshiro Inamura(45)" -This is from me.

23
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:28,439
"Happywow Vice President" -It's champagne from your birth year.

24
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:34,839
Thank you.

25
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,439
I got you something too.

26
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,539
A present.

27
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:43,739
What is it?

28
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,639
Why?

29
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:28,639
Stop...

30
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,838
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

31
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,938
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

32
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:01,738
A beautiful company president is shot

33
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,438
in a terrifying incident by a nimble man wearing a black mask!

34
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,038
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,838
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:09,039
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:56,449
"The Poodle and the Shotgun (Part 1)"

38
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:16,695
So the culprit suddenly fired at Ms. Anna with a shotgun?

39
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:17,696
Yes.

40
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:20,995
Looks like their only target was the president.

41
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:22,395
After shooting Anna,

42
00:05:22,396 --> 00:05:25,195
they immediately leapt onto another boat.

43
00:05:25,196 --> 00:05:27,596
They fled in an instant.

44
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:34,695
Their testimony is accurate.

45
00:05:34,696 --> 00:05:36,895
I witnessed it too.

46
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:38,895
Not just me.

47
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:40,595
I saw it too.

48
00:05:40,596 --> 00:05:42,395
So did Conan.

49
00:05:42,396 --> 00:05:43,495
Huh?

50
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:45,496
Where did that kid go?

51
00:05:56,796 --> 00:05:59,195
Fine scratches on her nails.

52
00:05:59,196 --> 00:06:00,696
What are these?

53
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:03,096
Hey, kid!

54
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:08,095
Don't you know you'll get in the way there?

55
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:10,096
It hurts...

56
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:14,795
It hurts...

57
00:06:14,796 --> 00:06:16,796
Sorry.

58
00:06:18,496 --> 00:06:21,895
Huh? Something smells.

59
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:23,396
It's dog food.

60
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:26,695
Dog food, huh?

61
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:30,596
It's a new product Ms. Anna's company will be selling.

62
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:39,595
In here?

63
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:42,295
Yes. I heard something.

64
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:43,995
Dad, be careful.

65
00:06:43,996 --> 00:06:45,296
I've got this.

66
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,495
You said you are Morishima, right?

67
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:14,695
What on earth happened?

68
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:16,095
Well...

69
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:18,395
"Sota Morishima (22)" -I was suddenly hit over the head.

70
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,195
"President's Secretary" -When I came to, I was in there.

71
00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:25,395
Were you invited to Ms. Anna's birthday party as well?

72
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:29,196
No. I'm Ms. Anna's secretary.

73
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:32,295
I arrived an hour early at 7 pm

74
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:34,395
to prepare for the party.

75
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:36,895
I was suddenly struck on the head

76
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:39,196
while loading luggage into the cabin.

77
00:07:58,796 --> 00:08:01,295
I woke up when I heard the gunshots

78
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:03,595
and found myself inside the locker.

79
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:07,196
So you were unconscious until then?

80
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,396
Yes.

81
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:14,995
Inspector, if no one's seen their face,

82
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:17,995
it will be impossible to identify the culprit.

83
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:20,896
No, I know who did it.

84
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:23,295
That's right.

85
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:26,595
He's the only one who could have done this.

86
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:28,495
He?

87
00:08:28,496 --> 00:08:30,095
Hyodo.

88
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:31,595
Makoto Hyodo.

89
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:34,095
What? Hyodo?

90
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,895
Mouri, you know him?

91
00:08:35,896 --> 00:08:40,395
Yes. Hyodo is Ms. Anna's ex-boyfriend.

92
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:43,195
He claimed to be a management consultant

93
00:08:43,196 --> 00:08:46,695
but when I looked into it, I discovered.

94
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:49,495
"Makoto Hyodo (38)" -that he was a conman.

95
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,295
A conman?

96
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:54,695
He offered Ms. Anna a fake investment offer

97
00:08:54,696 --> 00:08:58,895
and stole close to 50 million from Happywow.

98
00:08:58,896 --> 00:09:00,895
That's not all.

99
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:04,495
He also owed Anna herself a huge amount of money.

100
00:09:04,496 --> 00:09:08,495
Only the president herself knew exactly how much he took

101
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:10,995
but we repeatedly urged her

102
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:14,895
to file a proper reimbursement claim.

103
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:16,996
And now this has happened.

104
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,895
Darn that Hyodo!

105
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,095
He won't get away with this!

106
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:27,096
Huh?

107
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:31,095
-Takagi. -Yes, sir.

108
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:33,995
Hey, Mr. Morishima.

109
00:09:33,996 --> 00:09:38,295
Did you bring the presents for Ms. Anna too?

110
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:39,895
A present?

111
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:43,895
There was a bottle decorated with a ribbon

112
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:45,695
and a box on the deck.

113
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:53,095
VP Inamura and Director Enami brought those themselves.

114
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:54,695
The VP got her champagne

115
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:57,295
and the director got her a watch.

116
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,795
A watch?

117
00:09:58,796 --> 00:10:00,695
How do you know that?

118
00:10:00,696 --> 00:10:02,395
They're busy people

119
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:04,795
so I went to buy their gifts for them.

120
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:08,495
Both the champagne and the watch are incredibly high quality.

121
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:12,495
Are you also the one who brought the dog food into the cabin?

122
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:16,495
Yeah. I thought the president would bring her dog.

123
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:22,595
Right. Ms. Anna is always with her poodle, Sally.

124
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:26,596
But I wonder why she didn't bring her today.

125
00:10:28,196 --> 00:10:31,896
Did Ms. Anna expect this?

126
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:34,295
Stop!

127
00:10:34,296 --> 00:10:37,495
Stop right there, Hyodo!

128
00:10:37,496 --> 00:10:38,696
You jerk!

129
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:42,295
How dare you kill Ms. Anna!

130
00:10:42,296 --> 00:10:45,495
Don't hurt him, Mr. Mouri!

131
00:10:45,496 --> 00:10:49,295
Let go! I'll beat this guy to a pulp!

132
00:10:49,296 --> 00:10:52,195
Wait! I didn't do it!

133
00:10:52,196 --> 00:10:54,395
He's the one who killed Anna!

134
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:55,995
He?

135
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:58,195
The vice president, Inamura!

136
00:10:58,196 --> 00:11:00,895
He's got a shotgun!

137
00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:02,096
What?

138
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:11,695
It's true that I own a shotgun.

139
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:14,095
Skeet shooting is my hobby.

140
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:16,395
Why did you hide that fact?

141
00:11:16,396 --> 00:11:19,995
I wasn't trying to hide it.

142
00:11:19,996 --> 00:11:22,596
It was stolen recently.

143
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:25,895
Stolen?

144
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:29,095
Yes. Three days ago while I was preparing to go out,

145
00:11:29,096 --> 00:11:30,096
along with my entire car.

146
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:34,195
That gun must have been used in the crime.

147
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:37,395
But I have nothing to do with the case.

148
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,196
I even filed a robbery report.

149
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:43,795
I'm sure it's all a ruse.

150
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:45,095
What?

151
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:48,095
Or maybe Machiko stole it.

152
00:11:48,096 --> 00:11:49,595
Me?

153
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:53,095
You've got plenty of motive to kill Anna.

154
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:55,395
Stop that.

155
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:56,996
What are you talking about?

156
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:00,895
You're the one who taught Anna about business

157
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:03,495
when she was an unsuccessful idol.

158
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:06,495
Now your positions are reversed.

159
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:11,195
You were angry and in disbelief that Anna was the president.

160
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:12,795
You're lying.

161
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:15,295
I know everything.

162
00:12:15,296 --> 00:12:18,095
After all, you and I used to date.

163
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:20,295
What?

164
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:23,395
You resented Anna

165
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:25,795
because I dumped you for a younger woman.

166
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:27,995
You swore you'd kill her someday.

167
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:29,395
You're making it all up!

168
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:33,095
You're the one who had a motive to kill Anna!

169
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:36,295
You owe Anna a huge amount of debt.

170
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:39,595
Maybe you killed her because she was demanding you repay her.

171
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:41,095
You're one to talk.

172
00:12:41,096 --> 00:12:43,195
You're the one who benefits most from Anna's death

173
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,595
as the vice president.

174
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:46,995
What?

175
00:12:46,996 --> 00:12:50,395
Making Anna the president was your idea.

176
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:53,695
But once the company was on track, you didn't need her anymore.

177
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:55,495
She was just in your way.

178
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:57,495
That's enough!

179
00:12:57,496 --> 00:13:01,395
Ms. Anna wasn't shot by Mr. Inamura or Ms. Enami!

180
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:02,795
It was the masked man!

181
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:04,295
In other words, you!

182
00:13:04,296 --> 00:13:07,195
What? Do you have anything to prove that?

183
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:08,695
Proof?

184
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:11,495
Well...

185
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:12,895
You see...

186
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:14,395
See?

187
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:17,295
You're assuming I did it when you don't even have any evidence.

188
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,695
Mr. Hyodo, does that mean you have an alibi?

189
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:23,395
An alibi?

190
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:26,095
Between 7 pm and 8 pm,

191
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,995
the culprit hid in the cabin of the cruiser

192
00:13:27,996 --> 00:13:30,495
and waited for Ms. Anna to arrive.

193
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:34,995
Surely you can prove where you were during that time.

194
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:37,196
Between 7 pm to 8 pm?

195
00:13:39,596 --> 00:13:42,595
I have no choice. I guess I'll confess.

196
00:13:42,596 --> 00:13:44,895
I knew it. You killed Ms. Anna.

197
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:46,395
No.

198
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:50,895
During that time, I was robbing Anna's apartment.

199
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,396
Robbing her?

200
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:56,295
It was on a whim.

201
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:59,395
I have a spare key to Anna's place.

202
00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:03,495
And I knew she was throwing her birthday party here at 8 pm.

203
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:06,196
So I went when she'd be away.

204
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:11,595
I think it was around 7:20 pm.

205
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:14,795
There was only 30 thousand in cash,

206
00:14:14,796 --> 00:14:17,996
but just as I was leaving with it.

207
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:25,395
I accidentally dropped my gym membership card.

208
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:28,495
If you think I'm lying, search her apartment.

209
00:14:28,496 --> 00:14:30,695
Where is Ms. Anna's apartment?

210
00:14:30,696 --> 00:14:35,395
It's about 10 km west down the coast from here.

211
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:38,696
It's a 15 minute drive one way.

212
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:43,896
Why is he so confident?

213
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,543
This must be the card.

214
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:06,743
That's Mr. Hyodo's card.

215
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:08,643
What? Conan!

216
00:15:08,644 --> 00:15:10,543
I followed you.

217
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:12,643
It's just like he testified.

218
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:14,544
Yeah.

219
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:21,944
Conan, you shouldn't look in there.

220
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:24,743
It hurts!

221
00:15:24,744 --> 00:15:25,943
No...

222
00:15:25,944 --> 00:15:28,143
Sally!

223
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:29,444
Dog?

224
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:33,843
I'm beat.

225
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:37,343
I fell on my butt on the boat

226
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:39,844
and then got it bitten by a dog.

227
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:47,243
What's that?

228
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:50,143
It's a pet camera.

229
00:15:50,144 --> 00:15:53,743
It livestreams footage to the owner's phone

230
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,643
so they can check on their pet

231
00:15:55,644 --> 00:15:58,343
while they're out of the house.

232
00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:03,644
So today's video should be on Ms. Anna's phone.

233
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:13,943
If Hyodo's testimony is true, then...

234
00:16:13,944 --> 00:16:17,443
There should be video of him robbing the house on here.

235
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,644
Someone's coming in.

236
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:25,743
Hyodo's testimony was right.

237
00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:27,843
We can't see his face.

238
00:16:27,844 --> 00:16:29,843
We don't know that it's Hyodo.

239
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:32,543
But the time is 7:20 pm.

240
00:16:32,544 --> 00:16:35,644
That's the same time Hyodo said.

241
00:16:43,144 --> 00:16:44,744
This is it.

242
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:48,743
This is the card.

243
00:16:48,744 --> 00:16:51,644
It's just like Hyodo testified.

244
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:59,143
You knew she had a pet camera

245
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:02,243
and dropped your card on purpose.

246
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:03,943
What are you talking about?

247
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:05,243
Don't play dumb!

248
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:08,043
You did it to fabricate your alibi!

249
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:10,743
You're not the thief in the video!

250
00:17:10,744 --> 00:17:13,743
It's your accomplice pretending to be you!

251
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:15,543
Accomplice?

252
00:17:15,544 --> 00:17:16,843
If I have an accomplice,

253
00:17:16,844 --> 00:17:19,943
why don't you bring them here?

254
00:17:19,944 --> 00:17:22,543
What?

255
00:17:22,544 --> 00:17:24,243
See?

256
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:27,843
It was impossible for me to kill Anna.

257
00:17:27,844 --> 00:17:31,043
But even if he didn't have an accomplice,

258
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:34,244
he still could've killed Ms. Anna.

259
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:37,743
Mr. Morishima, weren't you unconscious

260
00:17:37,744 --> 00:17:41,043
inside that locker the whole time?

261
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:42,643
Yeah.

262
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:47,243
If he left the boat while Mr. Morishima was unconscious

263
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:50,543
and sped to Ms. Anna's apartment,

264
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:55,043
he could've arrived by 7:20 pm.

265
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:56,643
That's it.

266
00:17:56,644 --> 00:17:59,243
If he broke into her apartment pretending to rob her,

267
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,043
deliberately dropped his card so the camera would see it

268
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:04,843
and then returned immediately by car,

269
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:08,743
he could've killed Ms. Anna by 8 pm.

270
00:18:08,744 --> 00:18:10,443
I see.

271
00:18:10,444 --> 00:18:12,243
Well, Hyodo?

272
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:15,844
Your alibi has broken down.

273
00:18:16,944 --> 00:18:19,444
Are you sure about that?

274
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:30,243
It's only possible if Mr. Morishima was actually unconscious.

275
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:32,443
What do you mean, Conan?

276
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,644
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:39,343
I wasn't actually unconscious the whole time.

278
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:40,344
-What? -What?

279
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:43,243
I actually regained consciousness

280
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:46,043
as soon as I was stuffed into the locker.

281
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:48,043
I was watching the masked man's back

282
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:51,043
from inside the locker.

283
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:55,343
I didn't know what he'd do if he noticed

284
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:57,643
so I pretended to be unconscious.

285
00:18:57,644 --> 00:19:01,443
So the culprit was on the ship the whole time?

286
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:04,243
Yes. I'm certain of it.

287
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,543
Why didn't you say anything?

288
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:08,143
I'm sorry.

289
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:11,443
If I'd raised the alarm then,

290
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:14,644
it's possible the president wouldn't have been shot.

291
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:20,044
I let the president die.

292
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:25,743
I'm surprised you knew.

293
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:28,443
Mr. Morishima had regained consciousness.

294
00:19:28,444 --> 00:19:32,643
Mr. Morishima's mouth was covered with tape,

295
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:34,944
but he wasn't blindfolded.

296
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,343
Maybe the culprit knew that.

297
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,243
Mr. Morishima would wake up immediately

298
00:19:42,244 --> 00:19:46,343
and that he'd stay quiet inside the locker.

299
00:19:46,344 --> 00:19:48,743
In other words, they planned to use Mr. Morishima

300
00:19:48,744 --> 00:19:51,243
as their alibi from the start.

301
00:19:51,244 --> 00:19:52,643
Most likely.

302
00:19:52,644 --> 00:19:55,243
If he planned all that,

303
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:58,943
it makes him all the more suspicious.

304
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:02,143
You're treating me like a suspect based on suspicion alone?

305
00:20:02,144 --> 00:20:04,644
There's no evidence of any of this!

306
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:09,043
Officer, his testimony has made things clear.

307
00:20:09,044 --> 00:20:12,943
The culprit who shot Anna never left the ship.

308
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:15,243
I'm the one who robbed her apartment

309
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:18,643
and it was someone else who shot Anna.

310
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:22,243
Officer, I'm admitting to a robbery.

311
00:20:22,244 --> 00:20:24,943
Why don't you arrest me already?

312
00:20:24,944 --> 00:20:28,343
We still need to conduct an investigation before we arrest you.

313
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:31,943
We'll question you again tomorrow.

314
00:20:31,944 --> 00:20:34,143
Really?

315
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:36,143
Fine.

316
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:39,644
Then I'm leaving for today.

317
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:44,444
Sally.

318
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,444
What?

319
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:54,343
See you later.

320
00:20:54,344 --> 00:20:56,343
Inspector, it's him.

321
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:59,743
He's the one who shot Ms. Anna.

322
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:01,643
Proof.

323
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:03,644
We need to find proof.

324
00:21:07,344 --> 00:21:10,444
Ms. Anna was shot with a shotgun...

325
00:21:11,544 --> 00:21:13,644
by the masked culprit.

326
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:29,344
And they're the one who did it.

327
00:23:43,644 --> 00:23:45,643
"Next Episode" -It was definitely Hyodo

328
00:23:45,644 --> 00:23:47,743
who killed Ms. Anna.

329
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:49,243
The question is...

330
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:52,243
You're certain that this is your gun?

331
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:54,343
That's definitely mine.

332
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:56,543
The wood is cracked.

333
00:23:56,544 --> 00:23:58,943
I'm not lying!

334
00:23:58,944 --> 00:24:01,743
They were going to kill me, weren't they?

335
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:04,244
You're accusing me of being an accomplice?

336
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,644
Sally!

337
