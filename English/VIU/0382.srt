1
00:00:21,484 --> 00:00:24,083
The answer lies behind the message.

2
00:00:24,084 --> 00:00:26,083
Who is to win? God only knows.

3
00:00:26,084 --> 00:00:27,483
He sees through the one and only truth.

4
00:00:27,484 --> 00:00:29,283
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

5
00:00:29,284 --> 00:00:31,384
His name is Detective Conan!

6
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:58,328
Somebody visited us to invite us to the final game of the high school

7
00:01:58,329 --> 00:01:59,628
baseball tournament and Takarazuka Revue show, all the way from Osaka.

8
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:02,328
It was Heiji and Kazuha.

9
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:05,628
However, after finding out that both events will be on the same day,

10
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:07,229
the people from Osaka started to have a fight.

11
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:12,528
In order to decide which one to watch, Pops comes up with a suggestion.

12
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:14,829
A deduction battle begins.

13
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:23,029
"The Deduction Battle (Part 2)"

14
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:25,928
Kazuha.

15
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:28,828
What's wrong, Kazuha?

16
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:32,429
I'm just confused. This dying message is killing me.

17
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:37,628
If we can't figure out what it means, we're going to lose this battle.

18
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:42,428
No Takarazuka show. I just don't want to lose.

19
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,629
Battle...

20
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:51,628
Come on, there are no winners or losers in deduction.

21
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,328
Because...

22
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:58,429
what we have to do is to find the one and only truth.

23
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:01,529
That's true.

24
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:04,828
Hey, Hattori.

25
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:06,728
You got it too, right?

26
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:09,228
The true meaning of the dying message.

27
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:11,129
Nope. Not at all.

28
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:17,628
How come we don't have the actual blocks that have the ink spots on them?

29
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:20,528
If these were the actual blocks, not the pictures,

30
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:22,528
we could've looked at them like this.

31
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:24,729
Maybe there was something hidden behind them.

32
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:30,628
Well, too bad we can't see the backside of the blocks

33
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:33,229
because these are pictures.

34
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:42,229
I see. This guy...

35
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:48,328
It seems that the president

36
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,828
was having a hard time putting the ink on the blocks, huh?

37
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:54,228
His hands were tied behind his back.

38
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:57,328
Plus, he had to read the characters on the blocks with his fingers

39
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,429
in order to choose the right ones, right?

40
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:03,928
Look at those blocks. Each of them has different characters

41
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:06,328
and also a picture of an animal on it.

42
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,828
I would be confused and pick the wrong block for sure.

43
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:12,828
If it wasn't blocks but pieces of Japanese chess,

44
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:14,328
it would be so much easier

45
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:16,628
because there's only one character on each backside of the piece.

46
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:18,328
Kudo.

47
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,128
Only one character on the backside?

48
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:25,428
That would be even harder, stupid.

49
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:27,728
The pieces are not big enough to see

50
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:32,028
whether it was the victim's dying message or not.

51
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:33,928
Are they?

52
00:04:33,929 --> 00:04:41,529
Yes. Maybe the president just dropped the pieces on the ink accidentally.

53
00:04:43,429 --> 00:04:46,029
Maybe the dying message is actually on the...

54
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:52,028
So you did find the motive to kill

55
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:54,328
from the four workers who found the victim.

56
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:55,628
Yes.

57
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,828
First, about the accountant, Nao Aiko.

58
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:00,528
She was the former wife of President Tsujiya.

59
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:03,928
She had an affair with another man and got divorced.

60
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,228
They were having problems with alimony.

61
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:08,728
Atsushi Hasami, the sales clerk.

62
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:11,328
He had been told by the victim that he would be fired

63
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:15,028
if this year's revenue goes below last year's.

64
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:18,428
The planner, Isao Nakagami had been told the same thing.

65
00:05:18,429 --> 00:05:21,028
Also, there had been a lot of conflict between him and the victim

66
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,228
because of the design of their new toys.

67
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,828
Lastly, the vice president, Hajime Iwatomi

68
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:28,528
was not having a fight or anything with the president.

69
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,728
But actually, he is supposed to be the next president

70
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:33,728
if anything happens to President Tsujiya.

71
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:36,729
So all of them have a decent motive for murder.

72
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:42,528
A, u, e, o, u, i.

73
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:45,828
There you go. You're almost there.

74
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:50,528
There had been a lot of conflict between the president and the workers.

75
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:52,928
I'm curious what kept this company going so long.

76
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:57,528
The workers had been drinking in Mr. Iwatomi's house,

77
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:00,628
complaining about their boss and stuff.

78
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:03,328
On June 29th, which was the day of the murder,

79
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,328
the three workers went to Mr. Iwatomi's house to drink,

80
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:07,628
and stayed over night.

81
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:10,628
On the next day, all four workers came to the office together

82
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:13,028
and found the dead president.

83
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:14,528
One more thing.

84
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:18,428
This may have nothing to with the case.

85
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:21,428
But each worker has a strange obsession.

86
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:23,128
Obsession?

87
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:26,428
Ms. Aiko gets cold easily so she has 50 pairs of gloves.

88
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:30,728
She brings at least three pairs when she goes fishing.

89
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:34,028
Mr. Hasami is a movie lover and has 30 sunglasses.

90
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:35,528
Those actually include the limited models

91
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,828
which some famous actors used to wear.

92
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:41,528
Mr. Nakagami has at least 40 hats.

93
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:45,928
He wears them when he goes to the turf, just for good luck.

94
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:50,328
Mr. Iwatomi was the victim's golf friend, had 30 pairs of white golf shoes.

95
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:52,228
These are all expensive brand shoes.

96
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:55,828
He polishes them all once a week.

97
00:06:55,829 --> 00:07:00,128
And lastly. The victim, President Tsujiya was obsessed with idols.

98
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,928
It seems he had been collecting a lot of idol goods.

99
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:08,628
I found a lot those idol goods in the president's room over there.

100
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,128
That! See the one on the desk?

101
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:15,028
Pens and pen stands with the idol's picture on them and stuff.

102
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:16,229
I see.

103
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:20,528
Hey, Kudo. Have you noticed it?

104
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:23,628
You mean the unnaturalness of the desk?

105
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:26,128
But it's not only that.

106
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:30,128
Right. There's one more thing that's kind of bugging me.

107
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:33,728
I suppose this calendar is also the president's stuff, right?

108
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:37,628
Yes. That calendar is actually his favourite,

109
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:40,829
so he kept it even after that month passed.

110
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:46,229
Hattori.

111
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:51,128
Did you buy it? The novel.

112
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:54,428
My mom also got me one first thing in the morning today.

113
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:57,328
Have you figured out something, Kazuha?

114
00:07:57,329 --> 00:07:58,728
Kazuha?

115
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,528
Sorry, Ran. I can't talk right now.

116
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:03,329
I think I'm just about to solve it.

117
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:10,228
What is it now? What time do you think it is?

118
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:13,728
Don't you tell me you are still suspicious about us?

119
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:15,028
Well...

120
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:19,428
I heard some money matters were involved in this murder.

121
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:24,228
It's all because of our vague alibis. We have no proof as to it.

122
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:27,628
But what can I do? I was really at the turf that day.

123
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:31,928
I was at a golf course, watching the final round of the tournament.

124
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:35,728
I was watching movies. Actually, three movies in a row.

125
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:39,728
I was out fishing. I just happened to go by myself.

126
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:40,729
All right.

127
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,928
So who found the dead body first?

128
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,228
Who is this boy?

129
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:48,029
Could you just tell me more about it, please?

130
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,628
It's me who found him first.

131
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:56,428
I was going to sit at my desk when I found him lying on the floor.

132
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:58,028
I screamed.

133
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:00,028
As we heard Mr. Iwatomi's scream,

134
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:03,528
we all came here and called the police.

135
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:04,829
Right.

136
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:10,628
Before I forget, is it your president who rips the pages off the calendar?

137
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:15,228
Yes. The president gets upset if we do it because we might ruin it.

138
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:17,428
So Mr. Tsujiya always rips it off.

139
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:21,128
And he keeps it in his room like some kind of precious treasure.

140
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:25,529
Was he also the one who wrote the schedule on the calendar?

141
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:32,328
We were all supposed to play some golf together next Sunday.

142
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:34,728
I can't believe this actually happened.

143
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:38,928
Anyway, we've got to go to look for something.

144
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:41,229
You guys do the talking, okay?

145
00:09:49,229 --> 00:09:51,628
All right. Let's do it.

146
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,428
Yes.

147
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:56,728
The fact the video camera was at a blind spot

148
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,628
from the victim's point of view,

149
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:01,228
and the unnaturally neat desk.

150
00:10:01,229 --> 00:10:05,828
The bloodstain on the leather coat the murderer was wearing.

151
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:08,528
The suspects' strange obsessions.

152
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,428
And the president's dying message.

153
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:13,828
Right.

154
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:16,528
Now, all we need is that thing.

155
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:19,228
The thing that connects the pieces of the mystery all together.

156
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:22,628
What? One of the suspects got a solid alibi?

157
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:26,828
Yes. I'm at the TV station, checking the footage.

158
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:28,328
I see him.

159
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:29,729
Clearly.

160
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:33,329
Kudo.

161
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:37,829
Ran.

162
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:40,528
I found it.

163
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:42,528
It's the June calendar.

164
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,028
There's a thin bloodstain, but I can still see it.

165
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:47,428
That must be it.

166
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:49,428
The murderer is...

167
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:50,729
I got it.

168
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:54,328
Ran, I think...

169
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:56,229
I got the answer.

170
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,715
Seriously? You really got the answer?

171
00:11:03,716 --> 00:11:08,315
The dying message the president left at the murder scene.

172
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:12,215
Yes. The four building blocks with the ink spots, right?

173
00:11:12,216 --> 00:11:15,915
That looked like a hidden secret code,

174
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,915
but it was simply indicating the murderer.

175
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,515
The murderer?

176
00:11:20,516 --> 00:11:24,515
I don't think there's any person that looks like a building block.

177
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,415
No! It's the name.

178
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,515
Name?

179
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:30,715
None of the four names are related to "o", "mo", "chi", "ya" though.

180
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:33,315
Heiji mentioned it earlier. Remember?

181
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:35,815
The victim might have just put the blocks on the ink,

182
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:39,115
and not because he wanted us to read what's with the ink spots.

183
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:42,115
In other words, the backside of the ink spotted character

184
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:44,615
is the true dying message.

185
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:48,615
I understand. But we can't see what behind those characters.

186
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:52,515
I can ask the forensic officers to bring them here.

187
00:11:52,516 --> 00:11:54,415
No, you don't have to do that.

188
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,815
Look.

189
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:58,815
The blocks of "o" character

190
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:02,115
would look like this if I were to unfold it.

191
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:04,315
U, e, o?

192
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:08,215
You all know what kind of character will be in the blank space, right?

193
00:12:08,216 --> 00:12:11,915
Just in case, I checked the blocks over there.

194
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,215
As I expected,

195
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:19,415
the characters are lined up in the correct order.

196
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,315
Ms. Aiko, am I right?

197
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:25,115
Yes. Each block contains five characters with the same consonant

198
00:12:25,116 --> 00:12:29,116
and an animal picture in the same order.

199
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:37,515
If you know which character is on which side, it is no longer a hustle.

200
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:39,915
The backside of "o" is "i".

201
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:44,415
Accordingly, "mo" is "mi" and "chi" is "to".

202
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:48,815
Right! So the real dying message is "i", "mi", "to"...

203
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:50,015
And what's the last one?

204
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:51,615
It doesn't make sense.

205
00:12:51,616 --> 00:12:57,815
According to Kazuha, the last block "ya" is supposed to be "yu".

206
00:12:57,816 --> 00:13:00,115
But I actually see "yo" on it.

207
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:02,615
That block is special.

208
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:06,416
Look. You see "wo" on the right side of "yo"?

209
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:12,415
That means this block consists of "ya", "yu", "yo", "wa", "wo" "n".

210
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:17,215
If we put those characters in the same order, the animal part will be "n".

211
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:18,815
That's it!

212
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:22,815
According to the same rule, "ya" is "wa".

213
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:24,715
So the dying message is

214
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:27,416
"i", "mi", "to", "wa", right?

215
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:31,115
-So that's... -Imiwato.

216
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:32,615
Iwamito...

217
00:13:32,616 --> 00:13:35,115
-Iwato. -Iwato.

218
00:13:35,116 --> 00:13:36,116
That's right.

219
00:13:36,117 --> 00:13:39,116
That's what the president wanted to tell us before he was killed.

220
00:13:41,116 --> 00:13:43,215
The vice-president, Mr. Iwatomi.

221
00:13:43,216 --> 00:13:45,315
It was your name.

222
00:13:45,316 --> 00:13:46,615
I see.

223
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:50,615
You wanted to kill your president and take over the company, didn't you?

224
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:52,215
No, I...

225
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:53,815
Kazuha, that was amazing!

226
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:56,115
You actually solve the case before Hattori.

227
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:58,615
We won this deduction battle!

228
00:13:58,616 --> 00:14:00,015
So that means...

229
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:03,315
We can go to the Takarazuka show.

230
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:04,915
Sorry, Kazuha.

231
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,816
Mr. Iwatomi is not the murderer.

232
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:11,515
I had a phone call from Chiba.

233
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:15,015
The 29th of last month around 5pm, when the murder occurred,

234
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:17,515
Mr. Iwatomi was in fact on TV.

235
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:19,515
-No way. -Why?

236
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:22,115
Don't ask me why.

237
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:23,915
You have a twin brother?

238
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,116
No, I don't.

239
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:32,115
Sorry to tell you this, but Kazuha's idea was wrong.

240
00:14:32,116 --> 00:14:33,116
Oh, no.

241
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:36,016
No. She was right.

242
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:40,315
The four blocks are really the dying message

243
00:14:40,316 --> 00:14:45,415
the president Tsujiya left before he was killed.

244
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,815
Heiji.

245
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:50,215
But Hattori, Mr. Iwatomi has an alibi.

246
00:14:50,216 --> 00:14:52,315
Of course he has an alibi.

247
00:14:52,316 --> 00:14:54,915
Because Mr. Iwatomi is not the murderer at all.

248
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,615
What?

249
00:14:56,616 --> 00:15:01,215
You just said that it was the real dying message, didn't you?

250
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:04,015
Yes. For sure, I did.

251
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:07,715
But I didn't say the message was correct, did I?

252
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:10,215
Hey, hey. What are you talking about?

253
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:11,715
Hey, don't you remember?

254
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:14,715
How did President Tsujiya leave a message on the blocks?

255
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:16,415
Try to remember that.

256
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:22,315
Well, I think he was tied down on the floor behind the desk.

257
00:15:22,316 --> 00:15:24,415
He picked the building blocks

258
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:28,015
and put them in the puddle of ink on the floor, something like that.

259
00:15:28,016 --> 00:15:29,016
You got that right.

260
00:15:29,017 --> 00:15:32,915
The problem is the ink stain that's on the president's back.

261
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,515
What's wrong with it?

262
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,915
He got that ink stain when he was fighting the murderer, right?

263
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,915
That's what I thought at first.

264
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,916
But I noticed the unnaturalness on this desk.

265
00:15:46,216 --> 00:15:47,516
Unnaturalness?

266
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:55,215
It's weird.

267
00:15:55,216 --> 00:15:58,416
The chair just hit it lightly, but the pen stand fell.

268
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:02,515
Well, the ink bottle fell off the desk because people were fighting

269
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:04,315
and hitting the desk hard, right?

270
00:16:04,316 --> 00:16:05,415
Right.

271
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,615
Then how come the pen stand did not fall during the fight?

272
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:10,415
That is certainly strange.

273
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,215
This just sounds like

274
00:16:13,216 --> 00:16:16,615
the murderer spilled the ink on the floor on purpose.

275
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:20,315
No way. Why would he do that?

276
00:16:20,316 --> 00:16:22,615
That's like he's giving the president

277
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:25,815
a chance to write something about him.

278
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:26,816
Maybe...

279
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:29,515
It was on purpose.

280
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:34,215
That's right. The murderer deliberately spilled the ink on the floor

281
00:16:34,216 --> 00:16:37,115
to compel the president to leave a dying message about him.

282
00:16:37,116 --> 00:16:41,115
But it's dangerous. The president could leave the murderer's name.

283
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:44,815
That's only if he saw the murderer's face.

284
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:48,815
Why don't you lie down on the floor like the president was?

285
00:16:48,816 --> 00:16:50,616
What? Okay.

286
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:56,515
Maybe you'll get to experience how the president felt.

287
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,316
How he felt?

288
00:17:04,216 --> 00:17:05,815
I got it! Shoes.

289
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,816
It's the shoes!

290
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,015
The murderer narrowed the victim's scope with this desk

291
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:12,915
and made him determine who he was only by looking at his shoes.

292
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:16,415
So, the murderer wore white shoes

293
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:20,715
to make him leave a fake dying message about the murderer.

294
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:26,415
That's why the video camera was set up in the victim's blind spot.

295
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,215
The murderer was watching the president on the monitor

296
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,615
to make sure that the president wrote the desired dying message.

297
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:33,215
And then, he killed the victim.

298
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:36,115
But who did it anyway?

299
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:37,515
Hey, look.

300
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:38,615
What?

301
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:42,015
I found this strange calendar in the president's room.

302
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:43,016
See?

303
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:46,916
I thought you might know what this is.

304
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:52,015
Well, it's got a little stain, but other than that...

305
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:54,815
Don't you get it?

306
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:58,416
It's been wiped off, but it's a bloodstain.

307
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:02,215
Also, don't you think it's strange

308
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:05,915
that the president was murdered on June 29th,

309
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:09,215
but the June calendar at the murder scene was already ripped off?

310
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:14,315
In fact, there's a schedule written down on the 30th of the June calendar.

311
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:18,815
Who in the world would do that without any reason?

312
00:18:18,816 --> 00:18:20,115
Hey...

313
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:25,615
The June calendar was ripped, because someone had to hide the bloodstain.

314
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:29,315
We got something that's got the same bloodstain on it.

315
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,415
The coat the murderer was wearing!

316
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,815
The bloodstain on the shoulder looked kind of rubbed.

317
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:39,115
That's why I made the four workers stand in front of the calendar.

318
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:40,715
Hey!

319
00:18:40,716 --> 00:18:42,315
The only person who is tall enough

320
00:18:42,316 --> 00:18:44,015
to touch the top of the calendar with his shoulders...

321
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:45,815
You moron.

322
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:47,415
It is you,

323
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,015
Mr. Hasami!

324
00:18:49,016 --> 00:18:51,215
No one else could do it.

325
00:18:51,216 --> 00:18:53,515
Good job.

326
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:56,815
When the president came back to the office,

327
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:59,715
you attacked him from behind with a golf club.

328
00:18:59,716 --> 00:19:03,015
Wearing Mr. Iwatomi's white shoes and setting up the video camera,

329
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:08,315
you made sure that the president left behind the fake message.

330
00:19:08,316 --> 00:19:12,615
You probably were relieved after killing the president,

331
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:15,516
and leaned against the wall.

332
00:19:16,516 --> 00:19:19,415
That's when you got the bloodstain on the calendar.

333
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,215
You didn't notice it until the next day.

334
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:23,215
That's why you didn't dump it right away.

335
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:28,215
In fact, it's easy to steal the white shoes from Mr. Iwatomi's house.

336
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:31,915
People came and drunk at Mr. Iwatomi's house so often.

337
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,015
You had a lot of chance to steal them.

338
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:36,915
But the height of his shoulders is not enough evidence

339
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,215
to accuse him for the murder.

340
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:42,015
Actually, the evidence are those shoes.

341
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:45,215
You were wearing Mr. Iwatomi's shoes until the president left the message.

342
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:47,915
It's quite a long while.

343
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,515
The smell of your feet are definitely on them.

344
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:53,715
The police dog will sense your smell right away, right?

345
00:19:53,716 --> 00:19:57,115
I guess you had a decent reason for wearing those shoes

346
00:19:57,116 --> 00:20:00,515
until they smelled of your feet.

347
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:03,516
You can tell us about it if you want.

348
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:08,115
I wanted to kill the president by framing Mr. Iwatomi up for the murder.

349
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:11,515
I wanted him out of the toy production.

350
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:13,215
That's all.

351
00:20:13,216 --> 00:20:14,815
Why me?

352
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:17,215
I don't think I ever mistreated you or anything.

353
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,715
It's not me that you mistreated.

354
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:21,115
It's the children.

355
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:24,115
The children who are going to be playing with the toy

356
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:27,215
that you and the president were trying to sell.

357
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:28,716
I don't get it.

358
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:31,915
Here, look at this building block.

359
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,815
See how the corner have been smoothed off.

360
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:39,315
But to cut down the cost, they told us not to do it.

361
00:20:39,316 --> 00:20:41,815
That includes not only the blocks but the other toys, too.

362
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:44,715
They certainly look more appealing and could be more profitable,

363
00:20:44,716 --> 00:20:47,115
but are dangerous for children.

364
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:49,015
I disagreed with the idea, but we were going to be fired

365
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:50,915
if we did not follow their plan.

366
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,415
But you didn't have to kill him.

367
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,515
This company is having a hard time.

368
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:57,016
Hard time?

369
00:20:58,616 --> 00:21:01,716
Guess what President Tsujiya said?

370
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:05,415
Iwatomi! You want money?

371
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:09,215
I got tons of it. I'm not lying, just look in the safe!

372
00:21:09,216 --> 00:21:11,115
-What? -He had money?

373
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:15,415
Yes. I have no idea what and how he did it though.

374
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,416
But it doesn't matter.

375
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:21,716
I just didn't want to see the poorly-made toys and deceive kids.

376
00:22:53,816 --> 00:22:56,715
You really got that trick. I'm impressed.

377
00:22:56,716 --> 00:22:59,415
It's because of the novel.

378
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:05,715
The title of the novel my mom got me gave me the idea of that trick.

379
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:08,115
You better thank your mom.

380
00:23:08,116 --> 00:23:10,915
You won this deduction battle because of it.

381
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,315
We can finally go to the Koshien Stadium.

382
00:23:13,316 --> 00:23:14,815
Congratulations, Heiji.

383
00:23:14,816 --> 00:23:17,116
Oh, shoot! I forgot.

384
00:23:18,216 --> 00:23:21,316
Now, I have to practice the boola boola.

385
00:23:22,616 --> 00:23:23,815
Kazuha, wait.

386
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:29,315
Kazuha, I can ask Hattori for you to go to the Takarazuka show.

387
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:32,215
You are the one who solved the mystery of the dying message.

388
00:23:32,216 --> 00:23:34,415
You are actually half the winner, right?

389
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,415
Forget it.

390
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,915
What I really wanted to see

391
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,416
wasn't the Takarazuka show or the baseball game.

392
00:23:43,516 --> 00:23:48,216
It was Heiji's smile that he shows when he solves a case.

393
00:23:50,216 --> 00:23:53,516
Where did I go wrong?

394
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:56,316
You stupid.

395
00:23:57,616 --> 00:23:59,415
"Next Episode."

396
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:00,916
It's the Koshien Stadium!

397
00:24:05,816 --> 00:24:09,515
What's going on? Why not come here and get it?

398
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:13,515
I guess that person doesn't care whether we catch him or not.

399
00:24:13,516 --> 00:24:14,715
Right.

400
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:19,115
He said he's going to die if we can't find that thing before the game ends!

401
00:24:19,116 --> 00:24:21,615
Maybe he's still around here.

402
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:27,516
Next Conan Special, "High School Ball Game, Invisible Summer Devil".

403
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,515
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:47,615
"Retired Number."

405
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,615
The next episode of Conan is a two hour special Christmas present!

406
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:51,315
We'll be at the Koshien Stadium. Of course, I'm the hero!

407
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:52,516
What? You are gonna be playing?
