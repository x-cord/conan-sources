1
00:00:00,656 --> 00:00:02,356
The president of a game company,

2
00:00:02,356 --> 00:00:06,056
Mr. Kazuyoshi Onda was shot to death.

3
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:07,756
"Ryosuke Oomine (24)" -And a man called Ryosuke Oomine

4
00:00:07,756 --> 00:00:10,056
emerged as the prime suspect.

5
00:00:10,056 --> 00:00:13,056
Oomine takes a girl hostage at the shopping mall

6
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,056
in order to flee.

7
00:00:16,343 --> 00:00:18,343
I, who just happened to be there

8
00:00:18,343 --> 00:00:21,243
successfully rescued the girl

9
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:24,643
but ended up as the culprit's hostage in her place.

10
00:00:24,643 --> 00:00:27,043
Oomine brushes the police away

11
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:29,943
and hides in the basement of a certain building.

12
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:34,643
I confirmed that Oomine didn't have a gun on him...

13
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:37,743
and attempt to escape.

14
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:42,943
We were suddenly fired at by someone with a gun in the dark.

15
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:45,443
Oomine, protected me from the gun fire,

16
00:00:45,443 --> 00:00:47,543
despite risking getting hurt himself.

17
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:50,743
Is he really a murderer?

18
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:54,443
There could be something more

19
00:00:54,443 --> 00:00:57,543
behind the President Onda murder case.

20
00:00:57,543 --> 00:01:00,843
When Detective Takagi almost spotted us,

21
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:03,643
Professor Agasa sped by as per our request.

22
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:06,643
Because of him, we were saved.

23
00:01:06,643 --> 00:01:10,843
Yes, I can't afford to let them arrest him now.

24
00:01:12,443 --> 00:01:15,943
Not until I get to reveal the truth

25
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,943
that is hidden.

26
00:01:22,243 --> 00:01:24,443
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

27
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:26,743
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

28
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:28,543
A queer kidnap case,

29
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:31,143
I, the hostage discloses who the real culprit is.

30
00:01:31,143 --> 00:01:32,743
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:34,443
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:36,443
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:17,243 --> 00:03:23,043
"Two Days with the Culprit (2nd Day)"

34
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:26,186
Conan!

35
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:27,786
Are you all right?

36
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:29,686
I'm worry.

37
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:31,186
Ran!

38
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:35,386
I'm glad. That you've come back safely, Conan.

39
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:39,686
You!

40
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:43,486
Ran, wait!

41
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:50,986
He may not be the culprit.

42
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:01,086
"Received Call: Oomine."

43
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:03,586
Go ahead and answer it.

44
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:06,486
Isn't that what you're here for?

45
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:09,486
It's me.

46
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:11,086
Oomine?

47
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:12,686
Who are you?

48
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,186
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

49
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:17,586
Kogoro Mouri?

50
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:20,386
-Put Kanayama on the phone! -Hey, don't move!

51
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,986
Yes, ma'am.

52
00:04:23,686 --> 00:04:26,986
Let me hear Conan's voice, first.

53
00:04:26,986 --> 00:04:29,286
Don't be ridiculous, you!

54
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:33,186
Conan is fine! You don't have to worry!

55
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:36,386
Ran, don't tell me you've been taken hostage, too!

56
00:04:36,386 --> 00:04:38,086
No.

57
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:40,186
Hurry up and put Kanayama on!

58
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:41,886
What going on?

59
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:44,486
Here, he says to put you on.

60
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:45,786
Okay.

61
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:46,786
"Kanayama Seiichi (24)" -Oomine.

62
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:50,086
"Game Creator" -You idiot! We're in big trouble,

63
00:04:50,086 --> 00:04:51,486
so answer the phone, will you?

64
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:52,986
Sorry, sorry.

65
00:04:52,986 --> 00:04:55,586
I'll give you the address, so bring a car over!

66
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,086
Ask Momoko to do it.

67
00:04:58,086 --> 00:04:59,886
Get the address.

68
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:04,386
The cops came because I was waiting for Momoko at the market.

69
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:05,486
Momoko?

70
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:07,686
Just bring a car, will you.

71
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:09,886
I'm getting out of Tokyo.

72
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:12,186
The address is...

73
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,986
Just tell him that it's Dr. Agasa's house.

74
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,786
Dr. Agasa's house?

75
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,986
Don't tell me that Dr. Agasa's being held hostage too?

76
00:05:21,986 --> 00:05:24,386
Okay, here goes.

77
00:05:24,386 --> 00:05:27,086
Momoko is the woman

78
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:30,486
that was talking on that a while ago?

79
00:05:30,486 --> 00:05:32,986
She's Onda's secretary.

80
00:05:32,986 --> 00:05:37,186
We used to drink a lot together, with Oomine, too.

81
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:42,186
Please go, Mr. Mouri.

82
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:44,386
I don't have to go, do I?

83
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:50,886
Did you have that pistol from before?

84
00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:54,386
I bought it on the internet.

85
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:57,886
I was told it was loaded with blank and yet...

86
00:05:57,886 --> 00:05:58,986
Blank?

87
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:03,286
A gun mania remodeled an old metal gun

88
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:04,786
and was selling it.

89
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:07,786
But it's not the kind you can really fire.

90
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:09,886
"Homemade Gun Sale" -The bullets are blank that look

91
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:11,486
just like real bullets.

92
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:13,686
So, I ordered 1 revolver

93
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:16,186
and three blank bullets.

94
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:19,886
I just took it with me to threaten Onda.

95
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:22,486
"Caution" -It even said that the bullets are blank...

96
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:25,186
"Do not fire at people." -on the instruction sheet.

97
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:35,086
But, it turned out to be real when you fired it?

98
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:36,086
Yes.

99
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:38,486
And what did you do with that pistol?

100
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:40,486
I threw it away.

101
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:45,486
I thought that I was in bad trouble.

102
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,686
I haven't heard any news

103
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:04,586
reporting that the gun was found though.

104
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:06,186
Why don't we go there?

105
00:07:06,186 --> 00:07:08,186
Don't be ridiculous!

106
00:07:08,186 --> 00:07:11,086
I'm getting out of here when the car comes!

107
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:15,986
Kanayama!

108
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:26,186
Dad!

109
00:07:30,086 --> 00:07:32,286
Renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri

110
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:36,286
has captured the murderer Ryosuke Oomine!

111
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:40,186
I sure hope it turns out that way.

112
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:44,386
Mr. Oomine may have been taken advantage of by someone.

113
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:47,086
Just what are you talking about, brat?

114
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:48,886
It seems that the bullet that was fired from Mr. Oomine's gun

115
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,686
was a blank.

116
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:55,286
We need to find the gun that he fired, right?

117
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:59,686
Come to think of it, the gun hasn't been found yet.

118
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:02,586
Okay, let's look for it!

119
00:08:02,586 --> 00:08:05,386
First let's try going to the building where you threw the gun away.

120
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:12,186
You heard the gun hit something after you threw it, right?

121
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:13,686
Right.

122
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:16,086
If so, it's most likely that

123
00:08:16,086 --> 00:08:17,886
it hit the wall of the building.

124
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:24,786
There it is.

125
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:26,586
This way!

126
00:08:29,586 --> 00:08:31,886
The scratch is still new.

127
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:36,186
There's probably no doubt that the gun hit here.

128
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:39,186
If it hit here, it wouldn't bounce too far, right?

129
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,986
Right.

130
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:43,486
Some parts are damp.

131
00:08:43,486 --> 00:08:45,986
Someone must've walked around.

132
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:50,586
Could it be that...

133
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:54,086
If someone tried to frame Mr. Oomine,

134
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:57,086
maybe the real culprit came to retrieve it?

135
00:08:57,086 --> 00:08:59,586
When you threw the gun away,

136
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:02,086
weren't they doing something at the building?

137
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:05,586
To think that I would be able to meet

138
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,786
the renowned detective Kogoro Mouri.

139
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:08,386
It's such an honor!

140
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:11,086
I'm sure glad that I work as a security guard!

141
00:09:11,086 --> 00:09:13,986
Oh, is that right? Lucky you, lucky you.

142
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,086
I actually want to become a detective myself.

143
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:19,086
I'll quit this job right away,

144
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:22,586
so would you please use me as your assistant, sir?

145
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:26,186
This is a device for wiping windows, isn't it?

146
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:29,386
Yeah, don't dare touch it, brat.

147
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:31,586
What's with that remark of yours, mister?

148
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:33,986
Oh, I'm sorry!

149
00:09:33,986 --> 00:09:38,286
Does this go up and down along the rail of the building?

150
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,186
Exactly, little mister.

151
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:42,786
Is it fully automatic?

152
00:09:42,786 --> 00:09:44,886
Exactly.

153
00:09:44,886 --> 00:09:48,586
Did you wipe the windows last night?

154
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:49,886
Yes, I did.

155
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:52,886
The windows over there by the corridor.

156
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:55,586
I do it at night

157
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:58,586
because if I do it in the day time, the soap drips

158
00:09:58,586 --> 00:10:00,586
and causes inconvenience to the tenants.

159
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:02,586
The reason for the wet ground

160
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:04,686
is the soap from the window wiping device.

161
00:10:13,286 --> 00:10:14,686
There it is.

162
00:10:14,686 --> 00:10:16,886
Detective Mouri, please.

163
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:18,286
Here it is!

164
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:23,186
When Mr. Oomine threw the gun,

165
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:26,086
the automatic window wiping device was operating.

166
00:10:29,886 --> 00:10:32,186
The gun that Mr. Oomine threw

167
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:35,986
fell right on the window wiping device that came right below it.

168
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:39,986
Then, together with the window wiping device

169
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:42,786
that came back to the roof

170
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:46,386
after it finished its session and fell here.

171
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:55,786
This is very well made

172
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:58,386
but it's a fake.

173
00:10:58,386 --> 00:11:01,186
Because there's gunpowder in the cartridge.

174
00:11:01,186 --> 00:11:04,886
Which means that if you fire it, a gunshot will sound,

175
00:11:04,886 --> 00:11:07,086
but the bullet will shatter from the impact.

176
00:11:07,086 --> 00:11:10,186
Then, why did President Onda die?

177
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:12,686
Isn't it because someone shot him?

178
00:11:12,686 --> 00:11:15,586
-What? -The real killer who was hiding somewhere

179
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:17,386
in the park...

180
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:26,886
fired his gun the instant...

181
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:31,686
Mr. Oomine fired the blank

182
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:34,686
and killed President Onda.

183
00:11:34,686 --> 00:11:36,586
I see.

184
00:11:36,586 --> 00:11:40,386
Then, there are three suspects for now.

185
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:43,286
Game creator, Seiichi Kanayama.

186
00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:47,686
The president's secretary, Momoko Uemiya

187
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:51,386
and vice president, Satoshi Kanda.

188
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:55,286
Kanayama was on bad terms with Onda because of money matters.

189
00:11:55,286 --> 00:11:58,986
Uemiya probably had relationship problems with him.

190
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:02,586
And Kanda is said to have been going through power harassment.

191
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:05,186
But, didn't President Onda have many problems

192
00:12:05,186 --> 00:12:07,986
regarding his work?

193
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:09,886
Oh, right.

194
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:13,386
I mean, stop being cheeky, you brat!

195
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:17,786
How did you find the website of the guy

196
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:19,986
that sold you the gun on the internet?

197
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:21,786
Well. You see...

198
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:24,186
What're you hiding? Be honest and spit it out!

199
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:26,486
It's Momoko.

200
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:28,086
What?

201
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:34,786
Momoko said that I should possess a gun or something

202
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:38,086
because Onda was a candidate for the Olympic games in Judo.

203
00:12:38,086 --> 00:12:40,986
Therefore, she told me about the gun mania website.

204
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:43,586
I see.

205
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:47,786
Keep out of this! Children's time is over.

206
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:56,586
Doc.

207
00:12:56,586 --> 00:12:58,486
I've got one more place

208
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,986
I want to go to.

209
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:07,086
Why is it you have so many spare keys?

210
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,686
When I came to Tokyo,

211
00:13:08,686 --> 00:13:11,486
I was working as security guard for this building.

212
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:14,086
I made the keys back then.

213
00:13:16,986 --> 00:13:18,786
At that time...

214
00:13:28,686 --> 00:13:31,086
What was that sound?

215
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:32,986
I see.

216
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:34,186
Hey!

217
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,186
So that's how it was.

218
00:13:51,186 --> 00:13:54,586
Hey, what're you doing, kid?

219
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:59,186
Who knew that you used to work as a security guard here?

220
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:04,286
Knayama, Momoko, and vice president, Mr. Kanda.

221
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:06,686
What kind of person is Mr. Kanda?

222
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:10,286
He looks after Kanayama a lot.

223
00:14:10,286 --> 00:14:12,486
"Satoshi Kanda (32)" -He used to take me drinking a lot

224
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,486
along with Kanayama.

225
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,886
He's kind person.

226
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:22,986
Have you ever acted on stage?

227
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:25,886
What kind of question is that, out of the blue?

228
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,270
"OnDack."

229
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,336
"President's Office."

230
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:37,552
Hey, we can't have you come in...

231
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:39,552
Mr. Mouri?

232
00:14:39,552 --> 00:14:42,552
I'd like to talk to the Inspector.

233
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:44,952
I heard from Mr. Kanayama

234
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:47,552
that you meet Oomine at Dr. Agasa's residence.

235
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:48,852
Yes, sir.

236
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:52,452
Inspector, Oomine is not the culprit.

237
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:54,952
The real culprit is someone else.

238
00:14:54,952 --> 00:14:56,752
What are you saying?

239
00:14:56,752 --> 00:15:00,252
Could you call Ms. Momoko Uemiya?

240
00:15:00,252 --> 00:15:03,452
"Momoko Uemiya (24), Onda's Secretary."

241
00:15:04,452 --> 00:15:06,852
So the actors have all lined up here.

242
00:15:06,852 --> 00:15:09,752
What do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

243
00:15:09,752 --> 00:15:11,952
Let me explain in order.

244
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,752
First, this case started with the trouble

245
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:18,352
between President Onda and Mr. Kanayama.

246
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:21,952
The game software that Mr. Kanayama made was a great hit,

247
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:24,452
and yet despite the big profit that was gained,

248
00:15:24,452 --> 00:15:26,752
the cause of the trouble was because.

249
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:31,452
President Onda didn't pay Mr. Kanayama much.

250
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:34,352
Mr. Kanayama who was outraged

251
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:38,252
bad mouthed President Onda to Mr. Oomine.

252
00:15:38,252 --> 00:15:39,952
After hearing about this, Oomine offered

253
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:42,652
to threaten President Onda.

254
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:46,052
Then, Momoko Uemiya comes along.

255
00:15:46,052 --> 00:15:49,352
Mr. Kanayama and Ms. Uemiya are colleagues at the same company,

256
00:15:49,352 --> 00:15:52,152
and they used to go with each other at one time.

257
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:56,152
Oomine was in love with Momoko.

258
00:15:56,152 --> 00:16:00,152
Are you're saying that I got him into this?

259
00:16:00,152 --> 00:16:01,852
Exactly.

260
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:03,652
Don't be ridiculous!

261
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:07,352
You told Oomine of the gun mania website

262
00:16:07,352 --> 00:16:08,752
that sold guns...

263
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:11,052
I got advertisement mail from that website,

264
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:13,552
that's why I told him about it,

265
00:16:13,552 --> 00:16:15,452
that's all there was to it.

266
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:17,152
Cut it out!

267
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:22,452
Oomine? Conan!

268
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:25,452
Don't move! I'm going to blow this kid up!

269
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:28,152
Please don't make a fuss because he'll shoot me!

270
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:32,152
Bastard! I could've showed everybody what I can do, and yet...

271
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:34,552
Gather by the wall! The wall!

272
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:38,252
Let me go!

273
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:47,852
Don't! It's dangerous!

274
00:16:58,252 --> 00:17:01,852
You're being to reckless, Mr. Kanda.

275
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:04,152
I... I guess I got carried away.

276
00:17:04,152 --> 00:17:07,552
Thanks to the brat, it's gotten out of hand.

277
00:17:14,252 --> 00:17:16,252
Oomine, resign yourself.

278
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:18,352
Wait, please!

279
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:21,852
I haven't finished talking yet.

280
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:23,352
Mr. Mouri?

281
00:17:23,352 --> 00:17:26,552
How far did I go?

282
00:17:26,552 --> 00:17:28,952
You were saying that Ms. Uemiya was a suspect.

283
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:30,752
That's not right!

284
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:32,052
What?

285
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,252
But, you just said so...

286
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,852
The important point is who will benefit most

287
00:17:35,852 --> 00:17:39,452
from President Onda dying.

288
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:42,952
I get no cash even if the president were to die.

289
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:44,652
It's not me, either.

290
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:46,552
After all, I reported to the police

291
00:17:46,552 --> 00:17:49,052
that I got a call from Mr. Oomine!

292
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:53,452
Then, the only one left is you.

293
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:56,152
What? Why're you looking at me?

294
00:17:56,152 --> 00:17:58,652
You're gallant, aren't you?

295
00:17:58,652 --> 00:18:00,452
Because you had the guts to pounce on Mr. Oomine

296
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:01,852
who is wanted for murder

297
00:18:01,852 --> 00:18:04,652
and possesses a gun on top of that.

298
00:18:04,652 --> 00:18:08,452
Well, I was desperate to save everyone.

299
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:09,852
Isn't it because you knew

300
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:12,952
that Oomine's gun was filled with blank?

301
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:16,452
That's because you're the one

302
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:19,852
who sold the blank bullets and gun to Mr. Oomine.

303
00:18:19,852 --> 00:18:22,152
The one who killed President Onda

304
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:25,252
is you, Mr. Kanda!

305
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:28,552
No way. What a crazy thing to say!

306
00:18:28,552 --> 00:18:33,152
President Onda power harassed you.

307
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:35,252
Isn't that right, Mr. Kanayama?

308
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:39,452
Mr. Kanda became the target of the president's bullying.

309
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:42,352
After finding out that Mr. Kanayama

310
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:44,352
had a grudge against the president,

311
00:18:44,352 --> 00:18:48,252
you schemed to take advantage of his fact.

312
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,852
If Mr. Onda disappears,

313
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:52,552
you'll become the president.

314
00:18:52,552 --> 00:18:55,052
As a gun mania, you remodeled the metal model gun

315
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,752
that you had hidden,

316
00:18:57,752 --> 00:19:00,352
made a website to sell the gun

317
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:03,452
and sent the mail address to Momoko.

318
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:04,852
Just as you intended,

319
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,352
Momoko sent the address of the website to Mr. Oomine.

320
00:19:08,352 --> 00:19:10,952
Mr. Oomine bought the remodeled gun

321
00:19:10,952 --> 00:19:13,052
and blank bullets from you.

322
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,752
As for the blank, you probably remodeled the bullets

323
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:19,852
that you secretly brought back from abroad.

324
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:24,052
And at the same time that Mr. Oomine shot the blank...

325
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:30,052
you fired a real bullet using the other remodeled gun that you made!

326
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:36,352
After that, you needed to retrieve Mr. Oomine's gun

327
00:19:36,352 --> 00:19:39,952
to hide the fact that his gun was loaded with blanks.

328
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:51,052
You desperately went to look for the gun

329
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:53,352
but you couldn't find it.

330
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:57,252
Where do you think it was?

331
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:06,352
It was on the automatic window wiping machine

332
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:10,952
and carried all the way up to the roof.

333
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:12,352
I see.

334
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:14,452
It's a great deduction.

335
00:20:14,452 --> 00:20:17,352
However, do you have proof?

336
00:20:17,352 --> 00:20:19,752
That I remodeled a gun

337
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,552
or even went to search for it.

338
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:24,252
If you went to search for the gun,

339
00:20:24,252 --> 00:20:26,252
the soil around the building

340
00:20:26,252 --> 00:20:28,052
and the soap from the window wiping machine

341
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:30,352
should be on your shoes.

342
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:33,552
And one more thing,

343
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:36,452
the culprit has a wounded right finger.

344
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:44,652
Mr. Oomine who took Conan hostage

345
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:47,952
was shot at in the basement of the building.

346
00:20:47,952 --> 00:20:49,452
But, remodeled guns

347
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:51,552
are not all that strong to begin with.

348
00:20:57,052 --> 00:20:58,452
Here, this.

349
00:20:58,452 --> 00:21:01,752
Oh, thank you.

350
00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:03,752
-There's blood on it. -Yes.

351
00:21:03,752 --> 00:21:05,452
If you check the blood,

352
00:21:05,452 --> 00:21:08,752
you'll find that it's vice president Kanda's.

353
00:21:21,152 --> 00:21:24,352
Compensate for what you did and re-do your life once again.

354
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,652
Sorry, that things had to turn out this way

355
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,552
just because of me.

356
00:21:29,552 --> 00:21:31,452
It's okay.

357
00:21:32,852 --> 00:21:34,652
I guess it's a good chance

358
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:37,452
to go straight!

359
00:21:37,452 --> 00:21:39,152
That's good.

360
00:21:39,152 --> 00:21:41,152
-Really? -Yep.

361
00:21:48,152 --> 00:21:49,252
What's the matter?

362
00:21:49,252 --> 00:21:51,752
The case has already been solved.

363
00:21:51,752 --> 00:21:53,552
Oh, good work.

364
00:21:53,552 --> 00:21:56,252
Oh, well...

365
00:23:20,552 --> 00:23:23,052
You must've been scared, Conan.

366
00:23:23,052 --> 00:23:24,752
No big deal.

367
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:26,452
Since you went through a frightening experience.

368
00:23:26,452 --> 00:23:29,752
I'll make something delicious for you to eat today.

369
00:23:29,752 --> 00:23:30,752
Thank you.

370
00:23:30,752 --> 00:23:33,152
Found the brat!

371
00:23:33,152 --> 00:23:36,652
Well, you really come in handy.

372
00:23:37,752 --> 00:23:39,352
If we go to along with an grade school kid,

373
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:42,152
we get to eat Miracle Mille Crepe at Patisserie Matsui

374
00:23:42,152 --> 00:23:44,552
for half price!

375
00:23:44,552 --> 00:23:45,852
I... I've got something to do,

376
00:23:45,852 --> 00:23:48,052
so if you will excuse me.

377
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,952
Hold it!

378
00:23:49,952 --> 00:23:53,252
I would sure like you to half price your crazy ideas.

379
00:23:53,252 --> 00:23:55,352
I can get points for this, too!

380
00:23:57,152 --> 00:24:00,152
"Next Episode" -Wow, fantastic!

381
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:02,452
The sushi's going around.

382
00:24:02,452 --> 00:24:03,952
Don't move!

383
00:24:03,952 --> 00:24:05,952
I'm going to tell the police later

384
00:24:05,952 --> 00:24:07,952
if any of you move from where you are.

385
00:24:07,952 --> 00:24:10,052
I thought that Mr. Mouri was the one

386
00:24:10,052 --> 00:24:12,152
attracting bad cases,

387
00:24:12,152 --> 00:24:14,252
but it could be you.

388
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:18,052
Not letting anybody pick up the poisoned dish.

389
00:24:18,052 --> 00:24:21,152
A method in which only the victim is targeted.

390
00:24:21,152 --> 00:24:27,852
Next Conan, "Rotating Sushi Mystery (Part 1)"

391
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:43,963
Next Conan's Hint:

392
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:46,163
"Clockwise."

393
00:24:46,163 --> 00:24:47,263
What is clockwise?

394
00:24:47,263 --> 00:24:49,063
Which way does it turn, right or left?

395
00:24:49,063 --> 00:24:50,763
Either which way.
