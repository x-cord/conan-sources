1
00:00:01,664 --> 00:00:03,063
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03,064 --> 00:00:04,863
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,363
A code like cell phone mail.

4
00:00:06,364 --> 00:00:08,963
Pops is pondering when a cat appears!

5
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:10,363
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,364 --> 00:00:11,963
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,964 --> 00:00:14,064
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:57,412
At 9:00 in the morning, I have to meet a client.

9
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:59,712
From 10:00 to after 1:00 in the afternoon,

10
00:01:59,713 --> 00:02:03,213
I'll have lunch at Poirot while enjoying a relaxing coffee time.

11
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:06,497
Then from 2:00, I get to watch the long awaited drama series

12
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:10,897
starring Yoko Okino while video taping it.

13
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:13,997
And I'll take consideration making deductions from the plot.

14
00:02:13,998 --> 00:02:15,397
No. Wait.

15
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:17,397
I'll quickly watch five previous episodes

16
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:19,097
while waiting for the client to arrive.

17
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:22,198
Not bad a plan since I can review the storyline.

18
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:26,297
Talk about being busy!

19
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:28,898
What a satisfying life I'm leading.

20
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:32,097
Hey.

21
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:33,597
Just what're you guys doing?

22
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:35,698
It's already time to go to school, isn't it?

23
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:38,698
Well...

24
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:40,998
What is it?

25
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:43,297
Are you hiding something from me?

26
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:45,798
Well, it's not something weird or anything.

27
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:51,598
What the... It's just a cat.

28
00:02:56,498 --> 00:02:57,498
What?

29
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:58,998
A cat?

30
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:04,598
A cat!

31
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:13,098
"Secret of the Russian Blue."

32
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:15,597
Hey, hey.

33
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:17,597
Don't tell me you picked up a stray.

34
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,197
Well, no.

35
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,997
It's Aunty Eri's cat.

36
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:22,697
Eri?

37
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:27,297
If I remember correctly, she had a black and brown cat.

38
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:30,697
It wasn't this strange mouse like gray colour, was it?

39
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:33,197
It's called a Russian Blue.

40
00:03:33,198 --> 00:03:36,798
It's known for its blue-gray fur and green eyes.

41
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:40,397
The cat she had before died a month ago,

42
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:42,997
so she got this cat from an acquaintance of hers.

43
00:03:42,998 --> 00:03:44,997
Her previous cat was pretty aged already.

44
00:03:44,998 --> 00:03:49,297
And why is that cat in my office?

45
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:52,897
Because mother came just a while ago and...

46
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:54,497
Sorry, Ran.

47
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:56,598
Will you watch this cat for three days?

48
00:03:58,098 --> 00:03:59,297
What's up?

49
00:03:59,298 --> 00:04:01,297
I have to fly on an afternoon flight to Okinawa

50
00:04:01,298 --> 00:04:03,797
where a client of mine is working.

51
00:04:03,798 --> 00:04:07,797
Ms. Kuriyama who was supposed to take care of him is bedridden with flu.

52
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:09,697
But...

53
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:12,797
I have nobody else I can ask but you right now, Ran.

54
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:14,497
Okay?

55
00:04:14,498 --> 00:04:16,098
Wait, Mom.

56
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:19,498
Take care of Goro for me, okay?

57
00:04:20,998 --> 00:04:22,897
That's the story.

58
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:24,997
Take care of the cat?

59
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,798
But while you guys are at school, I'm the one who has to watch it.

60
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:33,597
Good morning, Ran!

61
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:34,797
Sonoko!

62
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:37,397
We're going to be late, Ran.

63
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:39,897
Is there something I should know?

64
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:41,898
Sorry, I'll be right there.

65
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:44,597
Bye, Dad!

66
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:45,598
Hey!

67
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:48,098
Take care of Goro for me, Dad.

68
00:04:53,398 --> 00:04:54,797
I see.

69
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:55,897
But, Ran,

70
00:04:55,898 --> 00:04:58,997
wasn't the name of the previous cat she had also Goro?

71
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,097
Yeah.

72
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:04,297
I think mom likes that name and gave him the same name again.

73
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:07,398
She says she named it Goro because its always rolling around doing nothing.

74
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:10,898
But I think the real reason is...

75
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:13,397
Gosh.

76
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:17,297
Why must a great detective like me take care of a cat?

77
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:19,097
It's easy because its already toilet trained

78
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:23,297
and all you have to do is make sure it doesn't run outside.

79
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:25,197
You watch it then.

80
00:05:25,198 --> 00:05:27,597
You can play hooky today.

81
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:29,997
I give you permission to do so.

82
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:31,798
Give me permission, I mean...

83
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:36,798
I'm busy all day today.

84
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:38,997
Excuse me.

85
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,497
I'm the one who called you last night. My name is Kirishita.

86
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:44,497
What? I thought we agreed to meet at 9:00 over the phone.

87
00:05:44,498 --> 00:05:47,797
Moreover, I thought I was told your wife would be coming.

88
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:51,197
The thing is, my wife fell ill,

89
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:54,397
so I stopped by here on my way to work in her place

90
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:56,097
and brought my daughter's code with me.

91
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:57,198
A code?

92
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:01,197
This is indeed

93
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:02,497
a code.

94
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:04,097
Yes.

95
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:09,197
This is an e-mail that my daughter mistakenly sent to my cell phone.

96
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:10,897
I don't understand what it means

97
00:06:10,898 --> 00:06:14,397
and my daughter kept on telling me to erase it right away.

98
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:15,597
I've come to ask for your help

99
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:18,898
thinking that maybe it could be something that needs attention.

100
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:22,097
What is it?

101
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:23,697
Oh, well...

102
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:26,897
It just reminded me of "Speckled Cat Holmes".

103
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:29,498
You know, the cat that appears in Jiro Akagawa's novel.

104
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:35,197
Right.

105
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:37,497
In the first story of "Speckled Cat Holmes",

106
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,997
Holmes is sitting on someone's shoulder.

107
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:41,797
Which means if a Russian Blue is trained,

108
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:44,997
it can ride on a shoulder too, right?

109
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:47,097
-I see. -Yeah.

110
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:51,197
Hey, hurry and go to school!

111
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:52,198
Okay!

112
00:06:53,398 --> 00:06:56,397
I thought you told me to play hooky just a while ago.

113
00:06:56,398 --> 00:07:00,997
Well, this mail does seem to smell a bit dangerous.

114
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:03,297
So you think so too, Mr. Mouri?

115
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,797
Yes.

116
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:09,097
The most I can make out of it is the second line, "Kare" (He),

117
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:13,297
and the last part of the third line, "Tsukiatte" (Go with me).

118
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:14,797
That's right.

119
00:07:14,798 --> 00:07:18,097
My daughter is in the second year of high school,

120
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:20,997
but it seems that she's recently working part-time in secret.

121
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:23,897
I'm worried that maybe she's being deceived by some bad man somewhere

122
00:07:23,898 --> 00:07:25,897
and dishing money out to him.

123
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:29,297
The fact is that my wife fell ill because of this, too.

124
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:30,697
I see.

125
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:32,997
Second year of high school...

126
00:07:32,998 --> 00:07:37,097
It sure is an age surrounded by many dangers.

127
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:40,097
My daughter is also in her second year of high school.

128
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:44,197
And she seems to be concerned about this leery detective kid.

129
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:47,397
Hey, I told you to hurry up and go to school!

130
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:49,797
I forgot something.

131
00:07:49,798 --> 00:07:51,198
Gosh.

132
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:58,597
Maybe it's a code that is popular among young girls.

133
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:01,997
I thought so, too.

134
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:05,097
So I asked the daughter of one of my colleagues at work.

135
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:07,997
And, what did she say?

136
00:08:07,998 --> 00:08:08,998
Well...

137
00:08:11,898 --> 00:08:15,697
She chuckled as soon as she saw the mail.

138
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:18,397
Why don't you let her do as she likes?

139
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,697
That is what she said.

140
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:22,897
While smiling mischievously.

141
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:26,498
Maybe it's a dirty mail after all.

142
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:32,598
For the time being, please forward this mail to my cell phone.

143
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:35,697
All right.

144
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:38,197
I'll contact you as soon as I figure it out.

145
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:40,598
Thank you very much.

146
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:47,397
See you later, Goro.

147
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:48,898
Take care of Pops, okay?

148
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:59,498
I don't have the slightest idea, no matter how many times I look at it.

149
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:04,598
I guess I'll go wash my face and freshen up.

150
00:09:06,198 --> 00:09:08,698
He was in the bathroom.

151
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:16,397
Gosh, what a nuisance.

152
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:20,697
Well, if it's as smart as the speckled cat in the novel,

153
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:22,698
it's another story.

154
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,897
What the heck?

155
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:31,898
That cat has been sleeping on this towel!

156
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:34,897
Hey, you cat!

157
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:36,698
Just what do you think you're doing?

158
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:41,597
These are videos of Yoko's drama series!

159
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:46,097
If you scratch them, I won't forgive you!

160
00:09:46,098 --> 00:09:49,297
The second episode's not here.

161
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,498
Don't tell me you hid it somewhere?

162
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:59,798
Hey, this time it's a shoe?

163
00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:05,397
This is Conan's shoe.

164
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:07,697
Just where did you bring it from?

165
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:10,797
Listen. You need two shoes to form a pair.

166
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:13,897
They're of no use if they were separated.

167
00:10:13,898 --> 00:10:15,098
Remember that!

168
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:19,598
Gosh.

169
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:22,597
Sneaking in and bringing things without permission.

170
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:25,398
He is not Holmes, but Lupin.

171
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:29,597
I see, I see.

172
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:31,397
This letter that looks like an "O" with strand of hair on it

173
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:34,597
must be the Greek alphabet "S" (sigma)

174
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:37,897
This letter that looks like a distorted "V" is the Greek alphabet "nyu".

175
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:43,097
The letter that looks like the hiragana "te" is the Greek alphabet "tau".

176
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:47,697
Which means the letters that formed "please come with me"

177
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:50,097
are read as "Please come witauh me".

178
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:51,997
What's this?

179
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:54,697
The Greek alphabet may stand for the names of stars.

180
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:57,697
It may have something to do with stars.

181
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,298
I'm sure that there was a book on stars around here some place.

182
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,998
Darn it! Playing pranks again!

183
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:12,097
An English-Japanese Dictionary?

184
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:16,097
English-Japanese means translating English to Japanese.

185
00:11:16,098 --> 00:11:22,497
In this e-mail, the English alphabet that is used is only "W".

186
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:25,998
But if this "W" were to be forcibly changed to Japanese...

187
00:11:27,998 --> 00:11:29,997
I guess it could pass for the hiragana "n"!

188
00:11:29,998 --> 00:11:31,397
I see!

189
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:32,897
I wonder if she's using foreign letters

190
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:36,597
that look like Japanese hiragana and katakana just for fun?

191
00:11:36,598 --> 00:11:40,897
That's why instead of "tsukiatte", she used "tsukiatau".

192
00:11:40,898 --> 00:11:45,297
If so, I feel like I'll be able to read it.

193
00:11:45,298 --> 00:11:47,398
Good work, Goro.

194
00:11:48,598 --> 00:11:49,997
Wait.

195
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:51,897
Don't tell me this cat

196
00:11:51,898 --> 00:11:54,498
was trying to tell me all this?

197
00:12:02,884 --> 00:12:05,584
Could it be like in the novel?

198
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:08,683
Hey!

199
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:10,484
This is not a toy!

200
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:14,184
It's no more than a cat after all.

201
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:20,883
At any rate, she had purposely substituted

202
00:12:20,884 --> 00:12:23,483
foreign characters for hiragana and katakana.

203
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:28,183
And it's obvious that our young lady wrote this message in a playful way.

204
00:12:28,184 --> 00:12:30,383
I'll take that into consideration.

205
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:32,983
"W" equals the hiragana "n".

206
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:35,183
And "nu" equals the katakana "re".

207
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:37,983
"Tau" equals the hiragana "te".

208
00:12:37,984 --> 00:12:41,283
So, the symbol equal would stand for the katakana "ni"

209
00:12:41,284 --> 00:12:44,583
and the postal code symbol equals the katakana "de".

210
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:46,283
But...

211
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:49,283
"Ni-de-de-ku"?

212
00:12:49,284 --> 00:12:51,383
What on earth does it mean?

213
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:54,983
It seems that the "S" that comes after the "W" and before hiragana "tsu"

214
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:58,083
has to be solved before this can be read.

215
00:12:58,084 --> 00:13:01,783
But there's no such letter in hiragana or katakana.

216
00:13:01,784 --> 00:13:05,284
So I'll use a circle to mark the unknown symbols and go from there.

217
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:20,583
"Yo-nn-gen-en-reka-re-niteteku"

218
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:23,184
I wonder if this is some kind of code after all?

219
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:29,884
Hey!

220
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:40,484
Darn it.

221
00:13:43,484 --> 00:13:45,584
Hey, not again!

222
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,484
I told you not to come here.

223
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,383
It's already past 12:00!

224
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:59,383
It's less than two hours to Yoko's drama.

225
00:13:59,384 --> 00:14:03,083
I've got to solve the contents of this mail before then.

226
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:06,584
Otherwise, I won't be able to watch Yoko's drama in peace.

227
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:12,183
Wait. Come to think of it,

228
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:16,783
he was doing something among the video tapes a while ago, too.

229
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:20,283
Maybe he's trying to tell me something again.

230
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:21,783
The thing that bothers me now

231
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:24,483
is that the video tape for the second episode is gone.

232
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:27,483
Gone... Lacking?

233
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:28,583
Wait, wait.

234
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:32,683
Before that, he was sleeping on the towel in the bathroom.

235
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:34,984
And his cat hair got on all over my face.

236
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:38,783
I see!

237
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:40,483
Remove and lacking.

238
00:14:40,484 --> 00:14:45,083
Maybe these letters not only look like hiragana and katakana,

239
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:48,183
but are actually scribbles that young girls nowadays

240
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:51,884
use a lot in writing words to make them look cute?

241
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:57,783
In that case, the sigma must mean a certain hiragana or katakana

242
00:14:57,784 --> 00:15:00,583
but with missing or dropped parts.

243
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:03,683
If so, the letter I can think of is...

244
00:15:03,684 --> 00:15:05,684
The hiragana "no".

245
00:15:07,684 --> 00:15:09,783
Then this plus-minus sign

246
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:13,283
is the hiragana "chi".

247
00:15:13,284 --> 00:15:17,183
Which means the plus-minus, "W" and sigma are...

248
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:19,183
"Chi-chinno?"

249
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,783
What is this?

250
00:15:20,784 --> 00:15:23,383
No. If something were added to the right of the plus-minus sign,

251
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:26,383
it would turn out as the hiragana "chi",

252
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,783
but what if something was added to the left?

253
00:15:28,784 --> 00:15:31,183
It'll turn into "sa"!

254
00:15:31,184 --> 00:15:33,183
So if this is "sa",

255
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:35,683
then the plus-minus, "W", and sigma will be...

256
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,983
"Sa-n-no".

257
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:42,183
Could it be that it should go before someone's name?

258
00:15:42,184 --> 00:15:44,983
The problem is the arrow before the plus-minus.

259
00:15:44,984 --> 00:15:50,284
I've seen this arrow on Sonoko's New Year's postcard before.

260
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,983
What's with that arrow?

261
00:15:53,984 --> 00:15:55,683
Oh, this means...

262
00:15:55,684 --> 00:15:58,583
"Happy New Year!"

263
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:01,883
I see. The arrow is a dash.

264
00:16:01,884 --> 00:16:04,483
It's used when you want to make a long sound.

265
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:07,883
In that case, the name that goes before the plus-minus

266
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,683
should be Sato or Taro,

267
00:16:09,684 --> 00:16:11,883
a name that has a long sound at the end of it.

268
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:14,984
Okay! I'll solve this code all at once.

269
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:21,484
Darn it!

270
00:16:22,484 --> 00:16:25,283
"Please go with me".

271
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,983
"Ni-te-te-ku-no-tsu-ki-a-tte".

272
00:16:28,984 --> 00:16:31,383
It's almost readable but not quite.

273
00:16:31,384 --> 00:16:34,283
Names that start with "yo"

274
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,683
and end with a long sound are "Yo-jo" or "Yo-ichiro".

275
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:40,784
No matter how I look at it, it doesn't look that way.

276
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:46,483
Hey, you.

277
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:48,684
Stop playing with my shoe!

278
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:51,983
Shoe?

279
00:16:51,984 --> 00:16:53,583
Come to think of it,

280
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:56,383
he was playing with Conan's shoe.

281
00:16:56,384 --> 00:16:58,883
Moreover, with only one side.

282
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,383
Back then, I...

283
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:04,383
Listen. You need two shoes to form a pair.

284
00:17:04,384 --> 00:17:08,783
They're of no use if they're separated.

285
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:11,183
Two makes a pair.

286
00:17:11,184 --> 00:17:14,883
Spaces for two characters were being used to display one character.

287
00:17:14,884 --> 00:17:18,183
That is, "koto" means "words" and "en" means "extend" in the first row.

288
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:19,983
If written as one word, the kanji character "tan" will be (tanjo=birth).

289
00:17:19,984 --> 00:17:24,083
And the two postal marks in the third row form "gyou" or "to go".

290
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,283
Wait.

291
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:29,583
Then the first hiragana character is "yo",

292
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:31,383
and if you add on the missing parts,

293
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:35,483
that is the hiragana character "ku" that is on the side,

294
00:17:35,484 --> 00:17:37,683
it'll make the hiragana character "o".

295
00:17:37,684 --> 00:17:39,083
And for the following character,

296
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:44,283
if I pair the "L" with the mirrored version of the hiragana "tsu",

297
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:45,983
it becomes the hiragana "to".

298
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:49,683
The letter on the second line which looks like flattened katakana "fu"

299
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:51,283
and the little circle make the katakana "pu".

300
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:55,183
If I read the second line keeping all this in mind, I get "pu-re-ka-i-ni".

301
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:58,883
It means "buy birthday present"!

302
00:17:58,884 --> 00:18:01,183
All right, if I keep reading...

303
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:05,783
"Go with me to buy my father's birthday present."

304
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,883
It's pretty easy to read girlish writing.

305
00:18:08,884 --> 00:18:09,983
Girlish writing?

306
00:18:09,984 --> 00:18:11,683
Hey, Dad.

307
00:18:11,684 --> 00:18:15,083
I hope you didn't lay your hands on a young girl or something?

308
00:18:15,084 --> 00:18:16,383
Oh, no.

309
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:19,483
This is an e-mail that a client asked me to decipher for him.

310
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:23,283
Wait. Why are you all here?

311
00:18:23,284 --> 00:18:25,083
What about school?

312
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:26,583
We went.

313
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:28,483
Just what are you talking about, Pops?

314
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:29,784
It's already sundown.

315
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:34,483
Then, hurry up and make dinner!

316
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:35,783
Yes, sir.

317
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:37,084
Let's go, Ran.

318
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,583
I'm home.

319
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:40,683
Hi!

320
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:42,684
Oh, glasses kid.

321
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:45,283
Gosh.

322
00:18:45,284 --> 00:18:47,884
They snatch away all the good parts.

323
00:18:53,284 --> 00:18:56,284
Even though we solved it all by ourselves, right?

324
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:01,784
I guess I'll call the client right now.

325
00:19:18,384 --> 00:19:21,583
The bonito strategy worked out great.

326
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:25,083
I snuck bonito in places and on things that would serve as clues

327
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:26,583
and made the cat mess around in the area,

328
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:29,383
so that Pops would catch the hint.

329
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:32,083
It seems to have worked out well.

330
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:34,183
Hello, Mr. Kirishita?

331
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:37,483
I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri, whom you came to see early this morning.

332
00:19:37,484 --> 00:19:39,683
Then don't tell me that...

333
00:19:39,684 --> 00:19:42,383
Then did you solve the code of my daughter's e-mail?

334
00:19:42,384 --> 00:19:45,983
Yes, indeed I have.

335
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,284
Hey.

336
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:50,483
It's dangerous if you fall off!

337
00:19:50,484 --> 00:19:51,783
Dangerous?

338
00:19:51,784 --> 00:19:54,183
So it was a dangerous e-mail after all.

339
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:55,783
I mean, no...

340
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:59,683
She's nowhere close to danger. Rather, she's well brought up.

341
00:19:59,684 --> 00:20:01,583
Well brought up?

342
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:03,583
Hey, idiot! Stop pulling!

343
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:06,483
You're the one who's pulling and stalling the conversation, Mr. Mouri!

344
00:20:06,484 --> 00:20:07,983
I mean, no...

345
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:09,483
Please tell me quickly.

346
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:11,283
What are the contents of the mail?

347
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:13,583
No matter what the contents, I won't be surprised.

348
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:15,483
I'm fully prepared for what's to come!

349
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:17,883
If I tell my daughter about the contents and ask her about it,

350
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:21,883
I'm sure she will stop sneaking around and tell me what she's up to.

351
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:23,384
So, go on, please tell me.

352
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:27,884
Mr. Mouri, Mr. Mouri!

353
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,583
No, actually I couldn't solve it at all.

354
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:39,983
What? Just what are you getting at?

355
00:20:39,984 --> 00:20:44,183
Besides, I got a request for a big job,

356
00:20:44,184 --> 00:20:47,283
and will probably be tied up with that job for a while.

357
00:20:47,284 --> 00:20:49,983
So I'm calling to say that I'd like to decline this request from you.

358
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:51,583
No way.

359
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,383
But she is a fine young lady,

360
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:58,983
so I'd advise you not to worry and watch over her!

361
00:20:58,984 --> 00:21:00,983
How can you be so sure?

362
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:02,984
You've never even met her.

363
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:08,884
I know from my hunch as a detective.

364
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:12,584
Please give my regards to your daughter.

365
00:21:14,084 --> 00:21:18,084
Birthday presents should be kept a surprise after all.

366
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:26,984
That cat maybe didn't need my help.

367
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:57,683
Are you hungry?

368
00:22:57,684 --> 00:23:00,584
Then let's ask Ran to make dinner for you.

369
00:23:01,784 --> 00:23:02,883
Dinner?

370
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:04,384
Sundown?

371
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,283
Yoko's drama!

372
00:23:07,284 --> 00:23:09,284
I not only missed it, I didn't get to tape it either!

373
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:13,583
I forgot all about it because you keep going here and there.

374
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:15,383
Not only that, but you hid the video tape, too!

375
00:23:15,384 --> 00:23:18,483
-Well... -Hold it.

376
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:21,283
Just what do you think you're doing to my Goro?

377
00:23:21,284 --> 00:23:22,983
Dear.

378
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,383
Eri? Aren't you were supposed to be in Okinawa?

379
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:27,983
I was so worried about him,

380
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:33,883
I flew back early and plan to finish the rest of my work via phone and fax.

381
00:23:33,884 --> 00:23:35,283
Come, Goro.

382
00:23:35,284 --> 00:23:38,584
It's time to say goodbye to this scary man.

383
00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:42,483
You may both be "Goro", but what a difference.

384
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:43,983
What?

385
00:23:43,984 --> 00:23:48,683
Wasn't the other black and brown Goro you had also attached to you?

386
00:23:48,684 --> 00:23:51,184
You're so different when it comes to denseness, too.

387
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:55,383
Don't tell me that Goro...

388
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:57,783
stands for Kogoro's goro?

389
00:23:57,784 --> 00:24:00,683
"Next Episode" -A story behind it?

390
00:24:00,684 --> 00:24:02,283
Don't tell me that

391
00:24:02,284 --> 00:24:06,384
it's that villa where the murder of the bandaged man occurred?

392
00:24:17,584 --> 00:24:19,683
It's completely sealed.

393
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:21,284
There are no traces of nails being removed either.

394
00:24:22,384 --> 00:24:27,784
Next Conan, "Sealed Western-style Window (Part 1)"

395
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:45,783
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,283
"Key holder."

397
00:24:48,284 --> 00:24:49,883
The next episode will be at Sonoko's villa.

398
00:24:49,884 --> 00:24:52,584
It's been a long time since we last dealt with Gunma Prefectural Police.
