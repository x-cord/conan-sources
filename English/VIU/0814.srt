1
00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:04,263
I'm counting on you, Doc.

2
00:00:07,463 --> 00:00:09,563
Come on!

3
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:15,762
We got a winner!

4
00:00:15,763 --> 00:00:20,663
An invitation to the Hotel Beika West cake buffet!

5
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:28,163
Congratulations!

6
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,362
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

7
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:33,562
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

8
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:35,062
The remarks that are tweeted in the blog

9
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:37,062
are not as sweet as sweets.

10
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:38,662
He sees through the one and only truth.

11
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,462
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

12
00:00:40,463 --> 00:00:42,863
His name is Detective Conan!

13
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:31,302
"The Actress Blogger's Locked Room Case (Part 1)"

14
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:39,501
It sure looks delicious. Looks good.

15
00:02:39,502 --> 00:02:42,001
There are so many types of cake here.

16
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:45,501
Are you sure we get to eat all we want of all this?

17
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:48,301
Yeah, because it's a cake buffet after all!

18
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:50,301
You've sure got a lucky streak when it comes to

19
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:53,001
winning lotteries, don't you, Doc?

20
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:54,601
But we were actually

21
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:58,701
after the assorted first class sirloin pack though.

22
00:02:58,702 --> 00:03:01,001
What? Really?

23
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:03,202
Yeah...

24
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:07,801
Cake buffet?

25
00:03:07,802 --> 00:03:10,701
I'll bet Ran will be envious if she hears about it,

26
00:03:10,702 --> 00:03:12,802
so I guess I won't tell her.

27
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,601
Okay. Big catch.

28
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:19,001
Genta, you're taking too much.

29
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:20,802
Okay, here I go too, then.

30
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,601
What?

31
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:25,601
You're limited to only two, Doc.

32
00:03:25,602 --> 00:03:27,702
No.

33
00:03:29,202 --> 00:03:31,302
Okay, just two.

34
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:40,002
And?

35
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:43,502
How was that police detective?

36
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:48,101
The one you sent asking me if I remember seeing him, right?

37
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,001
The man with the scary looking face.

38
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:53,201
Oh. You mean Officer Kuroda of the 1st Investigation Section.

39
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:56,201
He seems to have been saying a lot of suspicious sounding things

40
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,601
but they seem to have all been things deliberately said

41
00:03:58,602 --> 00:04:00,301
to arrest the perp.

42
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:04,401
Well, it did bother me that he knew a lot about me though.

43
00:04:04,402 --> 00:04:06,101
He backs up deductions

44
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:08,301
by viewing the case from an unexpected point of view

45
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:10,401
that leads to clues that solve cases.

46
00:04:10,402 --> 00:04:13,202
He's Sleeping Kogoro's bag of wisdom.

47
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:17,201
That's the rumor going around at the police department.

48
00:04:17,202 --> 00:04:19,302
Conan Edogawa.

49
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:23,001
But since he's at Nagano Prefectural Police,

50
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:25,901
we rarely run into each other so...

51
00:04:25,902 --> 00:04:28,301
I guess there's really nothing to worry about.

52
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:30,601
Really? That's fine, then.

53
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:33,502
Dig in!

54
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:43,301
It's good!

55
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:45,901
It's really delicious!

56
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:49,001
Genta, you should eat a bit slower!

57
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:53,401
But, unless I hurry, they'll run out of cake!

58
00:04:53,402 --> 00:04:55,702
Are you still going to eat?

59
00:04:57,202 --> 00:04:59,501
Oh my god! What's this?

60
00:04:59,502 --> 00:05:01,402
A helicopter?

61
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,901
That's one of the Petite Falcons that are popular right now.

62
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:08,501
I wonder where it came flying from.

63
00:05:08,502 --> 00:05:09,801
I'm sorry!

64
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:11,901
Are you okay, sonny?

65
00:05:11,902 --> 00:05:13,901
Oh... yeah!

66
00:05:13,902 --> 00:05:15,201
I bought that toy

67
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:18,801
just a while ago at the toy shop in front of the hotel,

68
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:20,001
but as soon as I switched it on,

69
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:22,101
it flew off to where I didn't expect.

70
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:23,701
What? Could you be...

71
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:26,401
TV talent Ms. Saya Kitami?

72
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:29,401
Oh, you're the one who came out in "Gomera", right?

73
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:34,701
Oh! The one who had your blood sucked by the enemy monster!

74
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:37,101
"Saya Kitami (24), TV Talent" -Don't talk too loud

75
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:40,501
because it's a secret that I'm staying over at this hotel.

76
00:05:40,502 --> 00:05:42,401
After I go get you a new piece of cake,

77
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:44,801
I'll take a picture with you.

78
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,201
All right!

79
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:49,601
You're as unscrupulous as ever.

80
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:52,101
You deliberately do things like that and befriend children.

81
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,401
So, you're going to take picture with the children

82
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:55,101
and upload it on your blog

83
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:59,201
to raise your popularity ranking.

84
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:00,501
The title will be...

85
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:04,501
Right. "Together with the children I met at the cake buffet"

86
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:06,201
or something like that?

87
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:09,401
I don't intend to do anything like that.

88
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:13,701
Hey, aren't those two Kyona Shono and Saya Kitami?

89
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:17,401
No. I heard those two really don't get along.

90
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:18,402
Come to think of it,

91
00:06:18,403 --> 00:06:22,001
they were fighting over popularity ranking of their blog.

92
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:23,301
If I remember correctly, I think the losing side

93
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:25,201
was going to shave her hair off.

94
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:27,301
What? Shave her head?

95
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:28,702
No joke?

96
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:32,901
Well, I know I'm going to win though.

97
00:06:32,902 --> 00:06:35,801
You never know.

98
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:39,901
Oh, you haven't seen my blog?

99
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:44,201
I know what your secret is, you know.

100
00:06:44,202 --> 00:06:46,601
If you don't want me to expose it,

101
00:06:46,602 --> 00:06:49,301
hurry up and hoist the white flag.

102
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:51,601
Your hair's short to begin with,

103
00:06:51,602 --> 00:06:54,501
so shaving your head means nothing to you, does it?

104
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:56,501
No.

105
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:57,901
I'm going back to my room!

106
00:06:57,902 --> 00:07:02,101
Oh, but weren't you going to take a picture eating cake?

107
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:03,901
I don't want to have the same kind of picture she has.

108
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:05,201
That would be the pits.

109
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:08,101
Please go buy the stuff I asked you for!

110
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:09,801
Yes, ma'am.

111
00:07:09,802 --> 00:07:12,501
Are you Sakurako?

112
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:14,601
Conan?

113
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,801
What're you doing here?

114
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:19,801
You're a housekeeper, aren't you Sakurako?

115
00:07:19,802 --> 00:07:22,801
Oh, that's because her manager caught a cold.

116
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:25,101
We got word at our working place

117
00:07:25,102 --> 00:07:30,202
to take care of her until her manager recovers, you see.

118
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:36,601
But I wonder why they're staying at the same hotel.

119
00:07:36,602 --> 00:07:39,601
They don't seem to be getting along too well and yet...

120
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:42,001
Oh, that's because this hotel

121
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:43,701
will be used as the stage for a drama series

122
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:45,801
starting this spring,

123
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:48,701
and those two will act as double heroines.

124
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:49,901
I know.

125
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,901
The drama's called "Top Class", right?

126
00:07:51,902 --> 00:07:53,701
I guess it had a good reputation

127
00:07:53,702 --> 00:07:55,401
so they decided to make a sequel.

128
00:07:55,402 --> 00:07:56,701
Really?

129
00:07:56,702 --> 00:07:58,801
What kind of drama is it?

130
00:07:58,802 --> 00:08:00,901
It's a drama where women expose their true selves

131
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:03,201
and are out to get each other any way they can.

132
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:04,601
Would you like to see it?

133
00:08:04,602 --> 00:08:06,701
It seems pretty interesting.

134
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:08,001
Oh.

135
00:08:08,002 --> 00:08:10,402
I guess not.

136
00:08:11,202 --> 00:08:12,801
I'll see you then.

137
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:15,601
I've got to go shopping, you see.

138
00:08:15,602 --> 00:08:17,201
Excuse me.

139
00:08:17,202 --> 00:08:19,601
After you go deliver that to her,

140
00:08:19,602 --> 00:08:23,001
will you come to my room, room 504?

141
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,001
I have something I'd like to talk to you about concerning her.

142
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:27,901
Oh, all right.

143
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:29,502
See you later then.

144
00:08:40,702 --> 00:08:42,202
Hey, Conan.

145
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:45,001
What're you looking at from a while ago?

146
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:47,701
Kyona Shono's blog.

147
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:50,001
Come to think of it, she was saying something to the effect that

148
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:54,301
Saya Kitami's secret is posted on her blog.

149
00:08:54,302 --> 00:08:58,501
Yeah. That's why I've been looking from a while ago

150
00:08:58,502 --> 00:09:00,801
but she's only playing with a dog,

151
00:09:00,802 --> 00:09:04,201
introducing her favorite comics

152
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:06,101
or cooking.

153
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:09,401
There's no secret anywhere.

154
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:11,901
Hey! What's this?

155
00:09:11,902 --> 00:09:15,701
I told you to get a super fine bristled toothbrush!

156
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:18,701
I'm sorry. That's all they had.

157
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:21,101
I'll go look for another one and buy it right away!

158
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,501
Never mind already!

159
00:09:22,502 --> 00:09:26,801
Shooting starts at 6pm, so will you come wake me up at 5pm?

160
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:29,001
I'm going to take a snooze till then.

161
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,001
Yes, ma'am, I will!

162
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:33,701
Let me tell you that if anybody besides you come,

163
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:36,001
I won't open the door,

164
00:09:36,002 --> 00:09:38,301
so make sure you come wake me up at 5pm, okay?

165
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:39,701
Do you understand?

166
00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:41,202
Yes!

167
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:53,701
Room 504...

168
00:09:53,702 --> 00:09:56,302
I found it! Here it is!

169
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:01,602
A heart mark?

170
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,101
Ouch..

171
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:05,902
Oh, sorry.

172
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:08,601
Are you all right? I hope you're not hurt.

173
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:10,501
Yes, I'm fine.

174
00:10:10,502 --> 00:10:13,501
Oh, there's something posted on your door.

175
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:15,001
I wonder what it is.

176
00:10:15,002 --> 00:10:16,402
From a fan, maybe.

177
00:10:17,602 --> 00:10:20,001
What did you want to talk to me about?

178
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:21,401
Oh, that?

179
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:23,201
I could care less about it already.

180
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:25,701
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:25,702 --> 00:10:26,902
What?

182
00:10:29,502 --> 00:10:31,701
I really ate my heart out...

183
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:33,701
Next it's dinner.

184
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:34,702
Already?

185
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:37,401
You're eating too much, Genta.

186
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:39,101
This is big trouble!

187
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:41,101
Please open the door!

188
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:43,002
Yes, but...

189
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:45,801
Is something wrong, Sakurako?

190
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:47,401
Oh, Conan.

191
00:10:47,402 --> 00:10:49,801
No matter how many times a push the door bell,

192
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:52,401
Kyona won't come out of her room!

193
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,402
What?

194
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,501
That sounds really bad, no?

195
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:58,001
Saya.

196
00:10:58,002 --> 00:11:00,301
I have nothing to shoot today

197
00:11:00,302 --> 00:11:04,201
but Kyona will begin shooting in 30 minutes.

198
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:06,501
She needs time for make-up

199
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:08,901
so she needs to be at the site already.

200
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:12,401
So, please open the door right away with the master key!

201
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:13,702
Okay!

202
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,601
Kyona, what's wrong?

203
00:11:20,602 --> 00:11:22,902
Shooting's going to start!

204
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:28,401
Kyona? Kyona?

205
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:30,602
You're here, aren't you?

206
00:11:31,202 --> 00:11:32,402
Kyona...

207
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,400
What's the matter?

208
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,399
Please call an ambulance and the police!

209
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,700
What? Oh, all right!

210
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,999
What's this?

211
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,599
Conan, that's a card key, isn't it?

212
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,699
Yep.

213
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,899
But, that's strange.

214
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,399
This hotel isn't auto lock.

215
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,899
-What? -How did the perp lock this room?

216
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,900
It's a locked room murder.

217
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,700
What's this white stain?

218
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,599
Whipped cream?

219
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,899
Which means...

220
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,399
Who on earth...

221
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't tell me that the perp...

222
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,100
Who could've done something terrible like this?

223
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,800
Could it be...

224
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,700
That's right.

225
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,799
She asked me to come wake her up at 5pm

226
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,399
but, no matter how much I rang the doorbell, she didn't answer

227
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,199
so I went to the front desk to ask them to open the door

228
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,399
and had the bellboy open the door with the master key.

229
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,399
Then I found Kyona in this bedroom bleeding from her head

230
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,099
-and lying on the floor! -I see.

231
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,499
But, if I remember correctly Sakurako, weren't you a housekeeper?

232
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,099
Her manager came down with a cold,

233
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,299
so I was asked to take care of her until her manager recovered,

234
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,299
and accepted the job.

235
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,599
But, I didn't expect something like this happen again.

236
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,899
Maybe I'm cursed after all?

237
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,599
Oh, no.

238
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,999
If you ask me, more than you,

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,399
Conan, who is always with you when something comes up

240
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,800
is more like Death to me.

241
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,899
And? When did she die?

242
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,599
Between 4pm and 4.30pm.

243
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,499
The medical examiner said that

244
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,999
she was struck repeatedly with a thin pole or something.

245
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,299
But, is it true that

246
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,899
the card key of this non-auto lock door of this hotel

247
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,199
was found on the floor?

248
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,700
Yes.

249
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,699
If so, this is a locked room murder case.

250
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,699
But, it's strange!

251
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,499
Because Kyona said that

252
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,199
she won't open the door for anyone unless I come,

253
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,399
and asked me to wake her up.

254
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,899
I wonder why she opened the door.

255
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,199
No matter who came besides you, Sakurako?

256
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,099
Something's strange about the way she asked you to do it.

257
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,299
You think so too, don't you?

258
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,700
A stalker.

259
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,499
She was once attacked at a hotel

260
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,799
by a man who pretended to be a staff member in the past.

261
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,499
Since then she stopped letting anyone into her room

262
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,599
even if she knew that person, unless they had arrangements

263
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,399
to see her beforehand.

264
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,999
Oh, I've read that in a weekly magazine before too.

265
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,199
Show business people have to go through a lot, don't they?

266
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,199
By the way, you're also a TV talent?

267
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,499
She's Saya Kitami who was scheduled to act together

268
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,199
in the drama with Kyona.

269
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,099
This hotel is the stage for the drama,

270
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,899
so she's also staying at this hotel.

271
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,899
I heard at the front desk that Kyona wouldn't come out of her room

272
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,399
so I was worried and came here with Sakurako.

273
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,200
I had no idea that we'd find Kyona like this.

274
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,999
At any rate, we need to check this room in more detail,

275
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,199
so will all of you who discovered the corpse,

276
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,699
Saya, Sakurako and Conan

277
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,599
wait in Saya's room for now?

278
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,799
Yes, sir.

279
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,500
All right.

280
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,499
Saya, is it true that

281
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,099
Kyona was found murdered in her room?

282
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,299
Yes. The police are in her room right now.

283
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,199
Wait. Seriously?

284
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,299
Then, what about today's shooting?

285
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,300
Stupid!

286
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:55,499
There'll be no shooting, more so, the drama itself is gone, no more!

287
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,399
So, please tell my make-up artist, that she may leave.

288
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,099
What? Your make-up artist was here, Saya?

289
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,499
-What? -Of course!

290
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,399
Today the main shooting was the part

291
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,399
where Kyona and Saya meet each other again at the hotel!

292
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,599
Really?

293
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,699
Then why did you say that, Saya?

294
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,199
Say what?

295
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,699
Remember, you said that you had nothing to shoot today.

296
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,399
-What? -Just as if you knew that

297
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,100
today's shooting was going to be cancelled or something.

298
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,799
I mistakenly thought so...

299
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,899
Oh, you just made a mistake!

300
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,300
If so, it can't be helped!

301
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,699
She's the perp after all.

302
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,499
The question is the card key that was in the room.

303
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,099
If you were to lock the key from outside,

304
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,099
you could insert the key into the room from the space under the door.

305
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,199
But no matter how hard you push it,

306
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,399
you could never push it all the way inside the room where it was found.

307
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,799
Was that toy helicopter used?

308
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,499
How?

309
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,799
And how did she get into the room when Kyona insisted that

310
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,799
she wouldn't let anyone besides Sakurako come into her room?

311
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,199
It seems unlikely that she'd invite her in

312
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,399
since they were arguing earlier.

313
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,500
At any rate, I still don't have enough pieces to assemble this puzzle.

314
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,599
What?

315
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,399
This room is right under Kyona's room?

316
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,499
What?

317
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,399
Kyona's room was room 604.

318
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,800
Yes, it seems that way.

319
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,199
The layout of the room is practically the same too, isn't it?

320
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,499
Yes.

321
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,699
Come to think of it, what was it?

322
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,099
The thing that was on your door.

323
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,599
I guess it was just a prank by a fan.

324
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,799
What thing?

325
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,399
There was a strange envelope!

326
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,199
It was posted on the door of Saya's room.

327
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,199
What kind of envelope?

328
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,299
There was large black heart drawn on it.

329
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,799
I think it was posted on right under the door peek hole.

330
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,099
Would you two like something to drink?

331
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,599
I can make you something simple.

332
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,999
Oh, I'd like iced coffee, please.

333
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,899
I'll have black tea then.

334
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,000
Okay!

335
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,899
But, isn't it amazing

336
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,199
that they let you stay in a big room like this during your shoot?

337
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,799
Well, the drama plays a part in advertising this hotel,

338
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,299
so they offered us these special rooms

339
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,199
because we're the two heroines in the drama.

340
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,099
Well, but I guess this drama's going to be dropped

341
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,400
and we'll have to be leaving this hotel tomorrow though.

342
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,900
I guess.

343
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,599
Conan, what have you been looking at from some time ago?

344
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,399
Saya's blog.

345
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,699
What?

346
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,999
I was thinking that Saya's blog is so different from Kyona's.

347
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,499
Different?

348
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,499
Because in Kyona's blog, she's included in all her pictures,

349
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,099
but, there are practically no pictures of you on your blog, Saya.

350
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,499
Even though there's a few sometimes, it's really small.

351
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,199
Unlike Kyona, I'm not good at appealing to people in pictures.

352
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,500
If they want to see me, they can watch the drama, I guess I'd like to say.

353
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,599
Come to think of it, what did you do with that?

354
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,299
Do with what?

355
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,999
The Petite Falcon.

356
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,999
You were flying it at the cake buffet, weren't you?

357
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,899
Oh, that?

358
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,999
It wasn't flying right, so I disposed of it.

359
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,699
What? What a waste!

360
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,999
Now we can't fly it together.

361
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,600
Fly it together?

362
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,200
Oh, here they come!

363
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,699
My friends! Is it okay for them to come in?

364
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,499
Hello!

365
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,399
Here, I bought you the Petite Falcon!

366
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,899
Oh, thank you!

367
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,399
But it's really hard, you know!

368
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,499
It doesn't fly like you want it to!

369
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,999
You need a lot of technique to work it.

370
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,400
Let me try.

371
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,699
You're fantastic, just great!

372
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,500
Oh, come on, it's quite easy.

373
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,599
Oh no! It got stuck on the air conditioner.

374
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,600
I need a pole.

375
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,499
-Here you go! -Thank you!

376
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,099
If you fly it in the room, you may get it stuck some place again

377
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,499
so why don't you fly it some other place more spacious?

378
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,000
I guess so!

379
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,399
We'll go play outside, so tell the police that!

380
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,300
Hey.

381
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,999
And? How about it?

382
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,599
Did you figure out the locked room trick?

383
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,799
No, not yet.

384
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,099
But, I have an idea how the perp made it in the room

385
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,699
and the murder weapon!

386
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,499
What? Then are you saying that the TV talent is the perp after all?

387
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,699
Yeah, no mistake about it.

388
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,899
No.

389
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,099
She seems to be so kind.

390
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,399
The outward appearance and inside of a woman are different, you know.

391
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,099
Although the lady who was killed

392
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,599
seemed to have a foul mouth, was vulgar and rude,

393
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,799
if you look at her blog,

394
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,799
you'll see that she had a sensitive and meticulous side too.

395
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,099
What? How did you find something like that out?

396
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,699
The bottles of manicure were lined out in order by number,

397
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,099
despite it being a brand where you couldn't see the number

398
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,899
unless it was turned over.

399
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,199
What?

400
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Wait a sec. Then, that picture...

401
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,999
I see. So this is the secret that she found out about.

402
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,899
But, would a person commit murder just for something like this?

403
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,300
Wait a sec.

404
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,300
Wait.

405
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,499
In English, this would be?

406
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,500
I see, so that's the story.

407
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,900
I've figured out why she had to kill Ms. Kyona Shono.

408
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,200
What? Rice cooker?

409
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,099
I see. That's the story.

410
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,599
The perp didn't use what the function was actually for

411
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,499
and turned that room into a locked room.

412
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,499
If you look through that door hole,

413
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,399
you'll figure out how the perp got into the room.

414
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,799
I tell you.

415
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,499
Who is it this time?

416
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,599
What? Doc Agasa?

417
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,999
Next Conan,
