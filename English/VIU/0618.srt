1
00:00:01,797 --> 00:00:04,897
Hey, Ran.

2
00:00:04,897 --> 00:00:06,497
Ran?

3
00:00:06,497 --> 00:00:08,697
Hey!

4
00:00:08,697 --> 00:00:11,097
The tea's over flowing.

5
00:00:14,897 --> 00:00:18,697
That glasses brat seems to have caught a cold.

6
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:19,997
Huh?

7
00:00:21,597 --> 00:00:23,597
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

8
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:25,897
You must be true to yourself.

9
00:00:25,897 --> 00:00:27,297
It's been a long time since they last saw each other.

10
00:00:27,297 --> 00:00:29,597
So, the atmosphere between Ran and Shinichi is strangely awkward.

11
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,197
He sees through the one and only truth.

12
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,297
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

13
00:00:33,297 --> 00:00:35,397
His name is Detective Conan!

14
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:17,798
What lay waiting for us when we arrived in London

15
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:19,998
was a coded memo of what looked to be a forewarning

16
00:02:19,998 --> 00:02:22,998
of a massacre that was about to happen.

17
00:02:22,998 --> 00:02:28,098
Ran calls Shinichi to get help on deciphering the code.

18
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:29,398
But during the conversation,

19
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:31,298
I realized that the first sentence of the coded note

20
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:35,298
was referring to the famous clock tower, Big Ben,

21
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:38,898
and carelessly told her what I realized, in Shinichi's voice.

22
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:43,198
Since Ran firmly believed that Shinichi is also in London,

23
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:44,798
she persistently pursues me,

24
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,398
so I had no choice but to...

25
00:02:50,698 --> 00:02:56,398
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Satan)"

26
00:02:56,798 --> 00:02:59,898
From right about after he got the call from Ran last night,

27
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:02,298
he suddenly started shaking...

28
00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:07,398
Since he ran around the city of London all sweaty,

29
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:08,898
then got cold in the night wind,

30
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,398
maybe he caught a cold.

31
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,598
Oh boy. I mean we're going to be

32
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:14,998
leaving for Japan tomorrow night already, and then...

33
00:03:14,998 --> 00:03:16,898
Well, he drank his medicine

34
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:19,198
and his fever is coming down, too.

35
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,598
So if he sleeps a day, he'll be fine!

36
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:23,098
So...

37
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:25,498
Don't worry about me.

38
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:29,798
Ran and Pops, please decipher that code!

39
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:31,598
The seven sentences in that coded memo

40
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:37,398
is each probably some building somewhere or a place!

41
00:03:37,398 --> 00:03:39,398
How do you know?

42
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:43,698
Shinichi told me so.

43
00:03:43,698 --> 00:03:45,398
Shinichi did...

44
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:50,598
By the way, Shinichi was saying in front of Big Ben

45
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,998
that the first line that goes, "The loud ringing of the bell",

46
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:55,798
means the chime of Big Ben.

47
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:57,798
In front of Big Ben...

48
00:03:57,798 --> 00:04:01,198
You mean that detective kid is here in London?

49
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:04,298
I mean, you knew about it, eh?

50
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:07,898
If I knew, I wouldn't have made a gift list!

51
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:12,298
At any rate, just leave Conan to me.

52
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:16,998
Ran and Kogoro, go ahead and decipher the code, all right?

53
00:04:21,698 --> 00:04:23,898
We somehow managed to get through.

54
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:26,998
But I didn't think you'd go as far as to drink the antidote

55
00:04:26,998 --> 00:04:28,798
you were supposed to use for returning to Japan.

56
00:04:28,798 --> 00:04:30,998
I couldn't help it, could I?

57
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:33,098
If I didn't drink it, the fact that the boy Conan Edogawa

58
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:38,298
is the childhood form of Shinichi Kudo would've been exposed, right?

59
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:40,298
How do you intend to get back home?

60
00:04:40,298 --> 00:04:42,698
There is no more drug left, you know!

61
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:45,998
I can't have Ai bring it over to me either.

62
00:04:45,998 --> 00:04:48,098
Well, I guess I'll stay cooped up in my room

63
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:49,798
and think of something.

64
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:52,198
Huh? You're not going out?

65
00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:54,098
You were planning to meet with Ran and the others

66
00:04:54,098 --> 00:04:55,898
to decipher the code, weren't you?

67
00:04:55,898 --> 00:04:57,398
You gotta be kidding!

68
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:58,598
How can I risk walking outside

69
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,198
when I don't have the slightest idea

70
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:02,398
when my body will turn into Conan again!

71
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:07,098
Beside, I really can't face up to her right now.

72
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:09,898
More important, look at this.

73
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:12,198
-This morning's paper. -Huh?

74
00:05:12,198 --> 00:05:13,298
From the fingerprints that were detected

75
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:15,798
on the piece of paper with the code written on it,

76
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:18,698
they seemed to have come up with a suspect!

77
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:20,798
His name is Hades Sabara.

78
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:22,898
He's a serial killer on the run!

79
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:27,198
First, we've got to investigate on this guy.

80
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:29,998
But, if they've come up with a culprit,

81
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:31,598
I'm sure he'll soon be arrested.

82
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,098
Come on!

83
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:36,598
This guy deliberately left his fingerprints behind, you know?

84
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:38,098
Which means he's planning to do something,

85
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:40,298
despite risking being arrested!

86
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:45,298
If you say that the loud ringing bell is Big Ben,

87
00:05:45,298 --> 00:05:47,898
it's quite convincing.

88
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:51,298
But there can't possibly be buildings

89
00:05:51,298 --> 00:05:53,498
that look like eggs or pickles.

90
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:55,198
-Excuse me! -Yes?

91
00:05:55,198 --> 00:06:00,598
Is there an egg-shaped building here in London?

92
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:04,398
Oh yes, there's a city hall near the Tower Bridge.

93
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:05,898
It's there!

94
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:10,998
"London City Hall"

95
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:12,098
It's unbelievable that

96
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:14,698
there would be a building shaped like this.

97
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:16,998
Then, for the 3rd sentence that goes...

98
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:19,398
"Fill an empty stomach on a boiled egg

99
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:21,498
as cold as a corpse" would mean...

100
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:23,398
this City Hall here!

101
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:26,598
What are these words? A code?

102
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:30,598
Do they mean a name?

103
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,498
The doll's name is Mazarin Stone!

104
00:06:33,498 --> 00:06:35,398
Mazarin Stone...

105
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:37,198
Mazarin Stone!

106
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:39,298
Hi!

107
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,398
How did you get the doll?

108
00:06:41,398 --> 00:06:45,398
The doll? I found it there beside the bench,

109
00:06:45,398 --> 00:06:47,498
under the shrubs.

110
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:49,698
Can I see that?

111
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:51,598
You can keep it!

112
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,398
I've got plenty already!

113
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:56,298
-Goodbye! -Goodbye!

114
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:59,098
What's that?

115
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:02,398
It may have something to do with the code!

116
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:03,598
You see,

117
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,098
the culprit who was passing out the paper with the code

118
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:11,098
said, "If you can't solve it, ask Holmes", right?

119
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:14,598
If so, he may have scattered things

120
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:16,398
that have to do with Holmes near the places

121
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:19,298
indicated by the code, don't you think?

122
00:07:19,298 --> 00:07:21,998
Shinichi told me some time ago,

123
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:25,998
that "Mazarin Stone" is the titles of one of Holmes' story.

124
00:07:25,998 --> 00:07:30,698
Hey, I went out of my way to make you lunch,

125
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:33,098
but you haven't touched it at all!

126
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:36,298
Sorry, I was just checking on a case

127
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:38,598
that Inspector Megure told me to investigate.

128
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:40,498
Geez!

129
00:07:40,498 --> 00:07:41,998
Getting carried away making deductions

130
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:44,898
to point of forgetting that you're hungry.

131
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,398
You're going to starve to death one day!

132
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:51,698
In a story called Mazarin Stone, Holmes said,

133
00:07:51,698 --> 00:07:56,698
"The brain works better on an empty stomach!"

134
00:07:56,698 --> 00:07:59,098
Holmes again?

135
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:02,698
"I'm all brains, Watson."

136
00:08:03,698 --> 00:08:06,398
"The rest is just a continuation of add-on sentences!"

137
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:11,098
If only the top part of the sentences is important...

138
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:15,298
The head part is what is important.

139
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:19,098
Hey, just what're you doing?

140
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,498
Huh? Something's written!

141
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:22,798
What?

142
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:24,198
T.

143
00:08:24,198 --> 00:08:25,698
T?

144
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:27,598
I get it!

145
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,898
Some alphabets are hidden in the places indicated by the code,

146
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:32,998
and if connected the alphabets,

147
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:35,398
probably form words. What do you think?

148
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:39,398
But after the "egg" is the "pickle", right?

149
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:42,198
A thin, flat building that looks like a pickle

150
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:45,098
couldn't possibly exist.

151
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:49,298
But the code said "Bite on the whole pickle."

152
00:08:49,298 --> 00:08:51,798
So, it must be pickles before they are sliced.

153
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,298
Don't be silly!

154
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:57,798
Pickles are young cucumbers immersed in vinegar, you know!

155
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:00,898
There's no way that such a long, narrow, round building

156
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:02,798
could exist in this world, you see...

157
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:11,298
That must be the one!

158
00:09:11,298 --> 00:09:12,798
No way!

159
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:17,698
This Hades Sabara guy is really dangerous.

160
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:20,898
He seems to have started off as a serious office worker

161
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:22,898
but after his mother fell ill, of a rare disease,

162
00:09:22,898 --> 00:09:24,898
he went out and borrowed money from his acquaintances

163
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,298
to gather funds for his mother's surgery.

164
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:29,398
Then he invested the money into stocks and bookies,

165
00:09:29,398 --> 00:09:31,398
but lost everything.

166
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:34,198
Because of this, his mother couldn't undergo surgery,

167
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,598
and she passed away last year in July.

168
00:09:36,598 --> 00:09:40,698
He slaughtered one man after the other,

169
00:09:40,698 --> 00:09:42,598
not only his acquaintances

170
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:44,498
who kept hounding him for collection,

171
00:09:44,498 --> 00:09:48,998
but also the people who suggested that he invest in stocks.

172
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:51,198
On top of that, he blew up the hospitals

173
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:54,198
that refused to perform surgery on his mother one after the other,

174
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:56,798
which resulted in a large number of casualties.

175
00:09:56,798 --> 00:09:58,598
Blew up...

176
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,398
You mean he uses bombs, too?

177
00:10:00,398 --> 00:10:01,598
Yeah.

178
00:10:01,598 --> 00:10:03,798
While Hades was on the run,

179
00:10:03,798 --> 00:10:05,598
he ran into a woman named Hestia,

180
00:10:05,598 --> 00:10:08,898
a military outcast and expert on explosives.

181
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:11,498
She helped Hades carry out his revenge!

182
00:10:12,598 --> 00:10:14,498
As for that woman,

183
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:17,998
it says that she blew herself up

184
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:20,498
when the police found her at her hide-out.

185
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:22,798
But since her body seems to have blown to pieces...

186
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:24,798
You mean the body that turned up was of someone else,

187
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:27,498
and that she is still alive?

188
00:10:27,498 --> 00:10:28,698
Yeah.

189
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:31,698
But why is it that such a vicious criminal

190
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,898
still remains on the loose?

191
00:10:33,898 --> 00:10:35,498
It seems that he's gone through

192
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:37,198
repeated plastic surgeries while on the run.

193
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:41,498
Well, with this guy, you can never tell what he'll do.

194
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:43,798
After all, he may have a grudge

195
00:10:43,798 --> 00:10:45,698
against the entire country of Great Britain

196
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:49,498
which allows bookies to prey on anybody, in every way possible.

197
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:56,098
It's from Ran.

198
00:10:58,898 --> 00:11:01,298
Sorry. Answer it for me, will you?

199
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:05,298
Huh? It'll be strange if I answer that phone!

200
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,598
I mean, hurry up and answer it!

201
00:11:07,598 --> 00:11:11,298
She could've come up with something concerning the code!

202
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:12,698
True.

203
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,998
-Hello? -If you're there,

204
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:18,098
hurry up and answer the phone, stupid!

205
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:21,698
That's Ran's cell phone, isn't it?

206
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:24,598
Ran's all blushed and couldn't work up the courage to call you,

207
00:11:24,598 --> 00:11:27,698
so I've decided to personally call you myself!

208
00:11:27,698 --> 00:11:29,598
I mean, she also says that there's no one other than you

209
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:32,098
who knows about Sherlock Holmes the most!

210
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:33,798
About Holmes?

211
00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:36,698
Yeah! The "egg" in the 3rd line

212
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:39,198
refers to the egg-shaped City Hall.

213
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,098
The "pickle" in the 4th line refers to

214
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:42,898
a building called the Gherkins

215
00:11:42,898 --> 00:11:44,598
that is shaped like a young cucumber.

216
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:46,498
We've figured this out.

217
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:50,598
But the problem is, things having to do with Holmes

218
00:11:50,598 --> 00:11:52,098
are scattered near all these places.

219
00:11:52,098 --> 00:11:53,498
Like, what kind of things?

220
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:56,698
A doll was found by the City Hall, and on its chest...

221
00:11:56,698 --> 00:11:59,698
A something Stone was written...

222
00:12:01,798 --> 00:12:03,898
Mazarin Stone was written!

223
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:05,598
Since you once mentioned that

224
00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:07,298
there was a scene in that story where Holmes said

225
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:09,498
"all the sentences except the top part are add-ons",

226
00:12:09,498 --> 00:12:11,198
that's why I...

227
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,098
I pulled the head of the doll off

228
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:15,998
and found the letter "T"!

229
00:12:15,998 --> 00:12:17,598
I see.

230
00:12:17,598 --> 00:12:19,398
Taking into consideration Holmes' dialogues

231
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:21,798
that are in the story of that title...

232
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:25,198
they lead to key words that provide hints to solving the case.

233
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:28,698
Yep! I found a lot of strange scratched up pens on the ground,

234
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:31,798
near the building called the Gherkin too.

235
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:34,798
The words "Dancing Men" are written on the barrel of the pen.

236
00:12:34,798 --> 00:12:37,798
This is the title of another one of Holmes' story, isn't it?

237
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,698
Yeah. Dancing men.

238
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:43,898
So, I thought there may be something hidden here too

239
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:46,598
and took off the caps on the top and bottom part,

240
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:48,398
but found nothing.

241
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:51,298
Then, take the caps of the top and bottom

242
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:53,098
and try matching the two up!

243
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:55,698
The scratches will most likely match up in a certain place.

244
00:12:57,598 --> 00:13:00,598
I found it! It's the letter N!

245
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:02,798
But, how did you know?

246
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:06,298
He said so in the story!

247
00:13:06,298 --> 00:13:09,198
"Get rid of all the deductions part way,

248
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:12,898
and indicate only the starting point and the conclusion.

249
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:14,498
Though it may seem meretricious,

250
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:17,698
it will have a sufficiently surprising effect!"

251
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:21,698
I see! That's why the barrel in the middle

252
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:24,698
had to be taken away before matching top and bottom caps together!

253
00:13:24,698 --> 00:13:27,098
Then, maybe there's something near Big Ben

254
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,198
that was mentioned in the beginning too?

255
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:32,798
I thought so too and came here,

256
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:35,398
but I can't find anything.

257
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,898
There's a strange arrow drawn on the road

258
00:13:37,898 --> 00:13:41,498
in front of the gate of Big Ben that dad found, but...

259
00:13:41,498 --> 00:13:43,498
-An arrow? -Yep.

260
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:46,398
You know that there's a bridge right beside Big Ben, right?

261
00:13:46,398 --> 00:13:48,598
It seems to be pointing in that direction.

262
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:52,398
I get it!

263
00:13:54,498 --> 00:13:55,998
Part way across the bridge

264
00:13:55,998 --> 00:13:57,498
beside the drain with the lid removed,

265
00:13:57,498 --> 00:13:59,398
there was something written.

266
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:02,098
The Valley of Fear.

267
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:04,598
It's The Valley of Fear!

268
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:06,998
I found it! I found it, Shinichi!

269
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:09,798
Where is the keyword hidden?

270
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:11,598
The Valley of Fear...

271
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:13,798
It was a long story.

272
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:16,698
I wonder if any bridge came out in that story?

273
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:19,498
No, it doesn't necessarily have to be a bridge.

274
00:14:19,498 --> 00:14:23,398
A drain... river... water...

275
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:24,598
Water?

276
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,998
Don't you see anything in the river?

277
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:28,298
Huh?

278
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:31,798
"If something heavy is gone near the water,

279
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:36,498
there's no doubt that something was sunk into the water."

280
00:14:36,498 --> 00:14:38,598
This is Holmes' dialogue.

281
00:14:38,598 --> 00:14:42,198
That's why I think that there's something sunk into the Thames.

282
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:47,698
On the lamppost that is on the railing of the bridge...

283
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:49,598
There is a thin rope tied on,

284
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:52,298
and the tip of the rope is sunk into the river!

285
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:05,198
It's the alphabet "A"! "A" is carved on it!

286
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,398
So, the letters you found are T, N, and A.

287
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:09,998
Hey, Shinichi.

288
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:14,298
I think the next place is going to be something like a cake,

289
00:15:14,298 --> 00:15:16,398
but where should I go?

290
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:19,698
Talking on the phone is getting us nowhere!

291
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:22,398
You wait there, because I'll be right over!

292
00:15:25,943 --> 00:15:28,043
The phone will do just fine.

293
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:31,143
You see, we somehow managed to find

294
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:33,143
the 3 keywords up to now, too.

295
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:37,043
Huh? If that detective kid is here in London,

296
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:39,543
wouldn't it be faster if we got together

297
00:15:39,543 --> 00:15:41,243
and solved the code with him?

298
00:15:41,243 --> 00:15:45,943
Or, do you have a reason for not wanting him to come?

299
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:47,443
No, it's nothing like that!

300
00:15:47,443 --> 00:15:48,843
Oh?

301
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:51,043
You're the girl I ran into yesterday!

302
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:53,743
Minerva Grass!

303
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:56,843
Minerva Grass, that tennis player?

304
00:15:56,843 --> 00:15:58,943
Is it alright for you to be walking around outside?

305
00:15:58,943 --> 00:16:01,943
The finals for the ladies' single match is tomorrow, isn't it?

306
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:05,643
Yes. I'm taking a break from training right now.

307
00:16:05,643 --> 00:16:07,543
Are you all right?

308
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:09,743
The thing that was bothering you last night.

309
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:13,043
Don't tell me that he's your boyfriend?

310
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:15,143
He's my father.

311
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:18,543
Besides, I'm more concerned over the code right now.

312
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:20,043
Code?

313
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:22,843
Then, it's the same as my younger brother Apollo!

314
00:16:22,843 --> 00:16:24,843
My brother received a piece of paper from a strange man,

315
00:16:24,843 --> 00:16:26,243
and seems to have given that paper with codes written on it

316
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:28,543
to a boy who claimed to be Holmes' disciple.

317
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:30,743
Holmes' disciple?

318
00:16:30,743 --> 00:16:32,843
I think his name was Conan.

319
00:16:32,843 --> 00:16:34,043
I see!

320
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:37,243
The Apollo that Conan was talking about was you!

321
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:39,943
Huh? Do you know him?

322
00:16:39,943 --> 00:16:41,043
Yes.

323
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:44,343
But today's he's sleeping back at the hotel because of a cold.

324
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:47,843
Did you hear that? Shinichi!

325
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:49,943
I coincidentally ran into a boy named Apollo

326
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:53,743
that gave the paper with the code on it to Conan.

327
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:55,243
Shinichi?

328
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:57,043
Sorry.

329
00:16:57,043 --> 00:17:00,343
I've come up with an urgent matter,

330
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:03,643
and can't go over there.

331
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:05,243
Is that so?

332
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:08,643
Yeah. I just got mail from a client of another case

333
00:17:08,643 --> 00:17:11,843
who says he's coming over to see me now.

334
00:17:11,843 --> 00:17:14,343
Well, if it's urgent, it can't be helped.

335
00:17:14,343 --> 00:17:16,143
Well, I'll be at the hotel,

336
00:17:16,143 --> 00:17:18,343
so just call me anytime!

337
00:17:18,343 --> 00:17:19,943
The one sending out the code

338
00:17:19,943 --> 00:17:22,643
is a nefarious criminal called Hades Sabara,

339
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:25,543
we've got to decipher the code as soon as possible.

340
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:27,043
If that boy Apollo is with you,

341
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:28,643
have him go around with you!

342
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:31,243
Because I'm sure that he knows London more than you two do!

343
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:33,543
Okay, I got you!

344
00:17:34,643 --> 00:17:36,443
You know what, Apollo!

345
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:38,643
Will you come along and help us decipher the code?

346
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:40,443
Yep! Okay!

347
00:17:40,443 --> 00:17:42,543
I'll be at the hotel.

348
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:44,743
I've got a masseur coming.

349
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:47,743
Please take good care of him!

350
00:17:47,743 --> 00:17:49,143
Sure thing!

351
00:17:50,943 --> 00:17:54,243
But the next code is cake, isn't it?

352
00:17:54,243 --> 00:17:57,743
Is there a building in London that's shaped like that?

353
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,043
Cake?

354
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:00,643
Yep, I know where it is!

355
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:01,743
-Huh? -Huh?

356
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:07,943
Wow! It really looks like a wedding cake!

357
00:18:07,943 --> 00:18:09,943
Of course it looks just like one!

358
00:18:09,943 --> 00:18:11,843
The wedding cake is said to have been designed

359
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:14,543
after the shape of this church!

360
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:17,643
Even the name is St. Bride Church.

361
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:19,943
It really sounds like a joke.

362
00:18:19,943 --> 00:18:22,443
Apollo, I'm amazed you knew about it!

363
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:25,543
It's because big sis used to bring me here a lot.

364
00:18:25,543 --> 00:18:28,243
She says that she going to get married to Ales

365
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:29,943
one day at this church.

366
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,543
Who's Ales?

367
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,543
Big sis' ex-coach!

368
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:37,743
Daddy used to be Ales' coach before though!

369
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,843
Your father died in a traffic accident.

370
00:18:40,843 --> 00:18:44,643
Yep! On his way to watch Ales' match.

371
00:18:44,643 --> 00:18:48,443
Big sis was at home that day with mother because of a cold,

372
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:51,743
and I was still in mother's stomach back then.

373
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:53,243
That's why I heard that Ales...

374
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:54,843
suddenly retired from being a player

375
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:58,143
and became big sis' coach!

376
00:18:58,143 --> 00:19:01,343
Because it seems to have been daddy's dream

377
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:03,943
to make big sis a winner at the Wimbledon!

378
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,043
Then, his dream has been granted!

379
00:19:06,043 --> 00:19:07,443
Yep!

380
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:13,743
But Ales still blames himself for the death of daddy.

381
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:16,243
So, he got into a fight with big sis

382
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:18,343
and quit being her coach.

383
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:21,243
I know that Ales likes big sis too, and yet...

384
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,643
He's bluffing being strong saying stuff like, "In Tennis, love is zero.

385
00:19:23,643 --> 00:19:25,343
No matter how much you accumulate on zero,

386
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:29,143
all you get from it is defeat."

387
00:19:29,143 --> 00:19:31,943
In tennis, love is zero.

388
00:19:31,943 --> 00:19:34,843
I see. That's why she said what she did.

389
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:39,543
Then, you're troubled over love?

390
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:42,943
But I'm no longer troubled, though.

391
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:46,043
Love is zero.

392
00:19:46,043 --> 00:19:48,043
No matter how many zeros you accumulate,

393
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:50,043
the result is miserable defeat.

394
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:56,643
Rather, I completely forgot to tell her

395
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:58,543
what I was supposed to!

396
00:19:58,543 --> 00:20:01,443
Who are you going to tell what to?

397
00:20:01,443 --> 00:20:02,643
It's nothing.

398
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:05,043
Don't we have to look for it?

399
00:20:05,043 --> 00:20:08,443
Somewhere in this church there is a hidden keyword

400
00:20:08,443 --> 00:20:10,643
that has something to do with Holmes, right?

401
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,543
Right. We've got to look for it!

402
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:22,043
"A Scandal in Bohemia"

403
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:23,343
What?

404
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:25,643
You found paper on the ground around the church

405
00:20:25,643 --> 00:20:27,743
that was shaped like a wedding cake?

406
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:30,343
And? What's written on the paper?

407
00:20:30,343 --> 00:20:32,243
It's handwritten and reads...

408
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:35,443
"A Scandal in Bohemia."

409
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,743
A Scandal in Bohemia...

410
00:20:37,743 --> 00:20:40,543
is the story that Irene Adler appears in.

411
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:42,543
And, is there anything besides the title

412
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:44,143
that is written on that paper

413
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,943
or is there something strange about it?

414
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:48,443
The color of the paper is light pink

415
00:20:48,443 --> 00:20:51,643
and the words seem to be written in black ink.

416
00:20:51,643 --> 00:20:55,343
There's nothing else strange about it.

417
00:20:55,343 --> 00:20:57,843
The paper is thick and you can't see through it.

418
00:20:57,843 --> 00:21:00,043
You can't tell because you're just looking at it

419
00:21:00,043 --> 00:21:02,043
and not really scrutinizing it.

420
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:05,243
How rude! I am scrutinizing it!

421
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:06,343
No.

422
00:21:06,343 --> 00:21:07,943
That's the dialogue that

423
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:10,743
Holmes said to Watson in that story.

424
00:21:10,743 --> 00:21:12,043
There was a scene where Holmes

425
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:14,443
showed a letter of that color to Watson.

426
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:15,643
If I want to take a closer look at it,

427
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:17,943
I'll have to take it out of the plastic bag.

428
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,743
Huh? Is it in a plastic bag?

429
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:23,543
-Yep. -Then, take the paper out of the bag

430
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:25,143
and wet it with water!

431
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:28,443
The plastic bag is a hint that tells you to wet it!

432
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:36,643
The letters are fading because of the water.

433
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:39,643
Only the letter "S" is left clearly legible!

434
00:21:39,643 --> 00:21:40,843
It seems that only the letter "S"

435
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:42,943
is written with an oil based pen.

436
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:47,443
Yeah! The paper is thick in order to hide this!

437
00:21:47,443 --> 00:21:48,543
If the paper is thin,

438
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:50,743
only the letter that is written with an oil based pen will smear

439
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:53,643
and all the way to the back of the paper.

440
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:55,743
Which means...

441
00:21:55,743 --> 00:21:57,743
that the keyword for the St. Bride Church

442
00:21:57,743 --> 00:21:59,743
that is shaped like a cake is...

443
00:21:59,743 --> 00:22:01,043
"S"!

444
00:22:01,043 --> 00:22:03,643
The egg-shaped City Hall is...

445
00:22:03,643 --> 00:22:04,743
"T"!

446
00:22:04,743 --> 00:22:08,143
The pickle shaped building Gherkin is...

447
00:22:08,143 --> 00:22:09,543
"N"!

448
00:22:09,543 --> 00:22:12,343
And the loud ringing sound of Big Ben...

449
00:22:12,343 --> 00:22:13,643
"A"!

450
00:22:13,643 --> 00:22:17,143
In the coded sentences Big Ben comes out twice,

451
00:22:17,143 --> 00:22:19,443
so I guess we can say that the letter "A" will appear twice.

452
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:24,743
Satan!

453
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,743
It's the devil.

454
00:23:53,543 --> 00:23:55,143
"Next Episode" -A massacre...

455
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,943
may occur here in London, you know!

456
00:23:57,943 --> 00:24:00,843
Did you see anyone suspicious

457
00:24:00,843 --> 00:24:04,143
at the place where you found the coded sentences?

458
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,543
Come to think of it,

459
00:24:05,543 --> 00:24:08,243
there was a woman wearing sunglasses there.

460
00:24:08,243 --> 00:24:11,143
Maybe that guy Hades is planning to attach a bomb

461
00:24:11,143 --> 00:24:13,543
to a balloon and let go of it?

462
00:24:13,543 --> 00:24:16,243
See, look!

463
00:24:16,243 --> 00:24:17,843
No way?

464
00:24:17,843 --> 00:24:19,343
Next Conan,

465
00:24:19,343 --> 00:24:23,443
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Code Break)"
