1
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:04,034
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:04,034 --> 00:00:06,134
After the tears, comes the knife of the mountain crone.

3
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:07,834
The members of the Youth Detective Squad get lost.

4
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:09,134
In the mountains where a mountain crone is said to live.

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,734
Something's bound to happen tonight!

6
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:12,234
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:13,834
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:16,134
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:09,551
"Road Closed."

10
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,320
It's a dead end.

11
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,320
What? Not again...

12
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,420
The 17th time.

13
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,320
The roads around here are really difficult to make out.

14
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,820
There are many forked and dead end roads that aren't on the map...

15
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,120
I told you not to, didn't I?

16
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,420
When you said that you wanted to avoid traffic

17
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,320
and take a side road, Doc.

18
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,720
Traffic jams and heat

19
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,920
are the two worst conditions for aircooling engines.

20
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,120
Besides, I figured that even if we did get lost

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,520
using the navigation system of the cell phone would suffice.

22
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,720
You're saying that you didn't think

23
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,520
this area would be out of range?

24
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,220
Why don't you have a navigator equipped in your car?

25
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,720
If you had a navigator in your car,

26
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,320
it would tell us where to go and all.

27
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,520
I'm hungry.

28
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,520
My navigator is still in the developmental stage.

29
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,120
Once it's completed, it'll really be something.

30
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,420
It'll be one of the best around, full of functions.

31
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,420
If it's ever completed.

32
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,020
Either way, let's go back.

33
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,220
If we keep on going,

34
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,920
we may be able to get out of the out of service range

35
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,420
and meet cars or people on the way too.

36
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,720
Okay.

37
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,420
It's so hard to figure these places out.

38
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,920
Shoots, it's completely flat.

39
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,220
You didn't bring the spare tire, did you?

40
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,620
I just changed all the tires to new ones,

41
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,820
so I didn't think I'd end up with a flat.

42
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,620
More than that, I had to leave the spare tire behind

43
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,420
in order to load all the bags.

44
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,720
The sun's gone down and it's dark.

45
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,320
We don't even know where we are.

46
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,420
I guess we've got no choice but to sleep out here.

47
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,720
What...

48
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,620
What do you mean what?

49
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,120
We were planning to camp to begin with anyway.

50
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
We've got everything we need to camp outside.

51
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,720
But, isn't this mountain? Kind of creepy.

52
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,820
Like a ghost appearing, right?

53
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
Oh, yeah... the kind that comes out in the folklores of Japan.

54
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,320
Like cannibal witches and mountain crones...

55
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Mountain crones...

56
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,620
Hey, come off it...

57
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,520
There are no such things in real life.

58
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,520
Huh? But, a house that fits the image is in view over there.

59
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,820
Hey, don't tell me that it's...

60
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,020
The house of a mountain crone.

61
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,220
No joke!

62
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,720
Oh, come on, no way.

63
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,720
That's right. It looks pretty big too,

64
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,520
so let's go ask if they'll let us spend the night there.

65
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,220
Huh...

66
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,220
At that house...

67
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,820
But, it's strange.

68
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,120
Since no other light is in view elsewhere,

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,020
that house is the only one around here.

70
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,120
To think that there's only one big house like that

71
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,620
deep in the mountains like this...

72
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,820
True.

73
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,220
It's just as if the house is beckoning us to come.

74
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,920
Telling us to come over...

75
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,320
What...

76
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,720
At any rate, we've got to decide

77
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,220
whether we want to spend the night out here

78
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,420
or ask whether we'll be able to spend the night over at the house.

79
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,520
What shall we do?

80
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,020
I'm scared.

81
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,420
But to sleep out here is dangerous too.

82
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,820
Let's go! To the mountain crone's house!

83
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,420
Huh?

84
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,120
Haibara and Ayumi!

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,620
I'll protect both of you with my life!

86
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,820
Thank you.

87
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,820
I guess you're going to give yourself if she decides to eat me then?

88
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
I don't think so.

89
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,320
Besides, I think the mountain crone would prefer Genta than me

90
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,420
for he has more fat on him and looks more delicious.

91
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,820
You'll make good soup stock yourself.

92
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,820
Really stupid.

93
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,420
So everyone!

94
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,520
Each of you hold your own bags, all right?

95
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,020
Okay...

96
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,120
"The Sword of The Mountain Crone Part One."

97
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,220
Well, the house sure has a fine thatched roof.

98
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,120
It doesn't seem to be the house of a mountain crone, does it?

99
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,520
-Let's go. -See.

100
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,420
They say that mountain crones usually live in small shabby huts.

101
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,720
Yes, right, and they're always holding kitchen knives, right?

102
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,720
Yeah, a really big knife, right?

103
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,920
Well, is it...

104
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,620
this kind of knife?

105
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,120
There she is...

106
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,320
A mountain crone!

107
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,620
Do you live here, granny?

108
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,320
Yeah, I do. Who are you people?

109
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,920
Could you put us up for the night?

110
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,120
Our car tire went flat.

111
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,320
A flat? In a place like this?

112
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,520
We're sorry to have to ask you something like this out of the blue,

113
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,420
but we got lost on the way to the camping site.

114
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,120
We were at a loss what to do, when your house came into view.

115
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,020
Is that so? You should have said so earlier?

116
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,320
What's with that knife of yours?

117
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,920
I was cutting pickled vegetables in that hut

118
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,320
when I heard your voices.

119
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,520
So, I came out to see who would come to a place like this.

120
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,820
Then, I heard you talking of a mountain crone.

121
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,720
There are no other lights in view elsewhere

122
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,220
except for your house, granny.

123
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,520
This is the only house in this area.

124
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,120
All those who used to live here

125
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,820
have left for town already.

126
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,420
Well, I can't give you a decent welcome,

127
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,120
but if that's okay with you, come on inside.

128
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,620
Thank you very much.

129
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,820
Huh?

130
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,420
Is there somebody else living here with you?

131
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,820
No. I live here alone.

132
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,220
But, there is another pair of slippers out.

133
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,820
"Tanaka Iwae, age 74" -Those slippers are my grandson Shota's.

134
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,920
He left ten years ago saying that he wants to become a cook.

135
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,520
It's just been left as is, since he left.

136
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,920
You can go ahead and use them if you want.

137
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,720
There are a lot of slippers in this shoe cabinet too.

138
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,920
Oh, no, I didn't mean to make it sound that way...

139
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,620
-Huh? -Here you go, Ayumi and Haibara.

140
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,020
There's a pair for you too, Conan.

141
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,320
Thanks.

142
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,720
Huh?

143
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,820
I wonder who this person is?

144
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,820
I wonder...

145
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,720
That's Shota.

146
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,620
He's a heartless character that never once came to visit

147
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,920
nor sent any letters after leaving here ten years ago.

148
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,020
He seems to have become a skilled chef now

149
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,320
and sends me a lot of money every month.

150
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,220
But I haven't touched

151
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,620
a cent of that heartless guy's money.

152
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,820
Oh, goldfish!

153
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,620
It's my grandson's goldfish too.

154
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,720
The nerve of him to leave something so bothersome behind.

155
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,720
The goldfish is pretty big, isn't it?

156
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,620
It's been alive for more than ten years already, you see.

157
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,320
Are you going to make it fat, then eat it?

158
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,220
Genta, what's with you, all stuck on eating stuff?

159
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,320
You're no different from a mountain crone.

160
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,920
Right, Conan?

161
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,520
What's the matter, Tsuburaya?

162
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,520
Just now, someone was looking this way

163
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,820
from the gap in that door!

164
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,120
What?

165
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,720
Huh? Now, who would come to a place like this?

166
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,320
Hey, Conan!

167
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,020
Who are you?

168
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,720
What are you doing there?

169
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,720
Boy, do you live here?

170
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,720
Yes, they are...

171
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,820
Would you go call the person then?

172
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,920
What do you want?

173
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,220
We hate to trouble you.

174
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,420
"Akane Ouba, age 25" -We came to this mountains

175
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,620
to go on a forest retreat.

176
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,720
"Raito Adachi, age 29" -But, we got lost

177
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,620
and on top of that we ran out of gas.

178
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,920
"Fuga Kahara, age 28" -If it's okay with you,

179
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,820
could you let us spend the night here just tonight?

180
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,820
We're not bad people or anything like that.

181
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,720
I'm Fuga Kahara.

182
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,220
I'm Akane Ouba.

183
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,420
I'm Raito Adachi.

184
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,920
I work in the service industry in Tokyo.

185
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,520
And I'm his customer.

186
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,820
Please do let us stay for just one night, please?

187
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,120
I'll let you stay tonight.

188
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,620
Thanks.

189
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,720
However, don't you ever come back here again.

190
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,320
What a snob.

191
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,520
She seems to be in a bad mood.

192
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
I tell you...

193
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,920
I wouldn't spend the night here, if she begged me to.

194
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,220
-Come on... -Don't just stand there, you guys.

195
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,520
But sit down where you can!

196
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,020
Yes, madam.

197
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,620
Don't irk her any further. We really can't afford that to happen.

198
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,920
I tell you, it's all because you got lost, Fuga.

199
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,420
I'm so sorry, my lady.

200
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,620
Well, let's go inside.

201
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
Host?

202
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,120
Both of you are hosts?

203
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,720
Yeah. I'm Number two at the shop,

204
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,120
while Raito is Number One.

205
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,420
Thanks to our lady here who patronizes us.

206
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,420
Look...

207
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,720
Goldfish...

208
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,120
Don't you think they're really cute?

209
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,020
There're quite a lot of them.

210
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,520
Oh, it's a Tamasaba!

211
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
Tamasaba?

212
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,220
See, this one!

213
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,120
It has a body like goldfish, but the tail of a mackerel.

214
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,820
Out of all the 12,

215
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,520
this one's a goldfish you don't get to see very often.

216
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,020
Fuga, you're knowledgeable!

217
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,720
I used to have them before, that's why...

218
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,520
You erudite king.

219
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,420
I know about stones, you know.

220
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,020
The transparent one at the right end is a quartz

221
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,820
and the one beside it, the mottled one is isinglass.

222
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,020
The one on the front left, that shiny black one

223
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,920
is an obsidian that was used in the Jomon Period.

224
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,520
Amazing...

225
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,220
You're both super geniuses!

226
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,220
I think it's call knowledgeable

227
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,120
and not genius in this case.

228
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,620
She's got it all thought out.

229
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,120
She acts dumb like that and makes men feel good,

230
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,620
and as a result she gets pampered.

231
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,820
She's the type that drives men down the drain.

232
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,720
What? Are you serious?

233
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,320
Yes, I'm serious, dead serious.

234
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,520
Excuse me.

235
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,720
If it's okay with you,

236
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,120
would it be all right to use your kitchen?

237
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
The kitchen?

238
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,420
Well, since I was planning to cook curry with the children

239
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,320
at the camp site,

240
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,220
I brought the ingredients to make it along.

241
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,020
I'm hungry.

242
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,620
Since it's easy to make,

243
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,720
I thought I'd make it for them.

244
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,620
Men shouldn't stand in the kitchen!

245
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,020
Huh?

246
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,220
If you've got the ingredients,

247
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,420
I'll make the curry for you.

248
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,320
Thank you.

249
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
I'll help you!

250
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,820
Kids shouldn't worry about things like that.

251
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,020
Just stay put.

252
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,520
Okay.

253
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,520
I never cooked before.

254
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Fine. I can make curry without anyone's help.

255
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,720
I used to make it a lot for my grandson before.

256
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,120
Where are the ingredients?

257
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,620
In that bag over there.

258
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,820
What a big bag.

259
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,220
I was wondering what he'd brought along also.

260
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:52,217
Granny's curry was good.

261
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:55,505
As long as you get to eat, anything's delicious right, Genta?

262
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:56,725
It sure was good, though.

263
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,944
Yes.

264
00:12:58,038 --> 00:13:00,038
The children use the room to the right

265
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:02,238
at the end of the hall.

266
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:04,238
Okay...

267
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:05,838
Thank you very much.

268
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:09,838
And you men use the room at the end of the hall to the left.

269
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:11,538
You use this room!

270
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:12,538
What?

271
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:14,838
I want to stay in the same room as the two of them.

272
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:16,638
Men and women should not share the same room

273
00:13:16,638 --> 00:13:18,038
after the age of seven!

274
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:20,538
Huh? Just what kind of a spell is that?

275
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:23,238
What a thing for a young unmarried woman to say!

276
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:25,238
What loose conduct!

277
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,238
What does loose conduct mean?

278
00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:28,838
We're seven years old,

279
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:30,538
but is it alright for us to be in the same room?

280
00:13:30,538 --> 00:13:32,238
I'm not married either.

281
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:10,138
Huh?

282
00:14:10,138 --> 00:14:11,738
What's this sound?

283
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:21,438
The sound's coming from here.

284
00:14:21,438 --> 00:14:24,138
I'm sure that this was the kitchen.

285
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:32,638
Huh?

286
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:40,638
What's the matter, Mitsuhiko?

287
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:43,238
It still before 4am.

288
00:14:43,238 --> 00:14:45,338
Please run away.

289
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:46,338
Huh?

290
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:48,738
Hurry... get out of here.

291
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:51,338
Or else, we'll be killed.

292
00:14:54,138 --> 00:14:55,638
The voice just now...

293
00:14:55,638 --> 00:14:57,438
It... it's that lady, right?

294
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,038
It came from outside.

295
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:08,038
Hey, my lady...

296
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:09,738
What's the matter, Akane?

297
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:11,338
-Akane! -What's the matter?

298
00:15:11,338 --> 00:15:12,338
What's up?

299
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:15,638
Akane...

300
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:17,638
Call the ambulance and the police.

301
00:15:17,638 --> 00:15:20,638
-Okay, I got it. -Quick!

302
00:15:20,638 --> 00:15:23,238
Akane. Raito.

303
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:25,738
-Fuga? -Let's take her inside.

304
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:27,738
Oh... okay.

305
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:33,838
It's no use.

306
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:37,038
Her artery's been stabbed with a sharp weapon,

307
00:15:37,038 --> 00:15:38,438
and there's too much bleeding.

308
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,738
It's too late already.

309
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,238
Hey, kid,

310
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:42,338
don't say something you're not sure of...

311
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:43,438
Fuga.

312
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,438
I can't believe it.

313
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:57,638
A sharp weapon?

314
00:15:57,638 --> 00:16:01,938
Normally a dagger or a kitchen knife.

315
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:05,938
The problem is... who would want to kill her at this hour of the day,

316
00:16:05,938 --> 00:16:08,038
and with what kind of sharp weapon.

317
00:16:08,038 --> 00:16:09,638
Moreover, in a remote mountains like this.

318
00:16:09,638 --> 00:16:12,138
A knife in the remote mountains.

319
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,238
Don't tell me that...

320
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,638
Mountain crone...

321
00:16:15,638 --> 00:16:17,238
The police as well as the ambulance

322
00:16:17,238 --> 00:16:19,238
should be here in an hour or so.

323
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:21,338
Hey...

324
00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:23,638
What's the matter, Mitsuhiko?

325
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:25,138
Nothing...

326
00:16:25,138 --> 00:16:26,538
I hope you're not thinking

327
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:29,838
that I'm the mountain crone.

328
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:31,538
Oh, granny.

329
00:16:31,538 --> 00:16:33,838
Would you lend me your bathroom?

330
00:16:33,838 --> 00:16:35,738
Yeah, go ahead.

331
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:38,238
I really want to wash the blood off.

332
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:39,238
That...

333
00:16:39,238 --> 00:16:42,338
Oh, go out the sliding paper door, turn right at the stairs

334
00:16:42,338 --> 00:16:44,938
and go all the way to the end of the hall to go to the bathroom.

335
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,338
See, just beyond the kitchen.

336
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:49,438
Kitchen...

337
00:16:52,738 --> 00:16:55,438
So putting your story together.

338
00:16:55,438 --> 00:16:59,238
This morning at about 3.58am, you went out

339
00:16:59,238 --> 00:17:02,338
because you suddenly heard a scream from outside the house

340
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:05,938
and found this woman with her neck slashed, is that right?

341
00:17:05,938 --> 00:17:07,638
Yes.

342
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:12,838
The name of the victim is Ms. Akane Ouba, age 25.

343
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:15,338
She's the daughter of the president of a financial company?

344
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:17,938
Yes, that's right.

345
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:20,238
And according to what I hear...

346
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:22,738
When you all got here,

347
00:17:22,738 --> 00:17:26,438
there was another person who was already right beside her.

348
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:27,738
Oh, that's me.

349
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:29,838
Huh? Are you the one who killed her?

350
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:31,438
Oh, no.

351
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:34,738
I was on the first floor to go to the restroom

352
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:36,238
when I heard her scream.

353
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:40,538
That's why I got to her before everyone else did.

354
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:41,938
And when you got to her,

355
00:17:41,938 --> 00:17:44,338
did you see any suspicious person around?

356
00:17:44,338 --> 00:17:46,038
No, not that I recall.

357
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:48,138
It was sort of dark yet besides,

358
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:50,338
and above all, I was more concerned about her lying on the ground.

359
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,238
By the way, what's your name?

360
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:57,938
Huh... Raito Adachi.

361
00:17:57,938 --> 00:18:00,338
Mr. Raito Adachi.

362
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:01,938
And, you?

363
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:03,438
Fuga Kahara.

364
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:06,038
Mr. Fuga Kahara.

365
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:09,438
Huh? This house is the Yamada residence, isn't it?

366
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:10,938
It's Tanaka!

367
00:18:10,938 --> 00:18:12,838
This is the Tanaka residence.

368
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:16,538
I'm Iwae Tanaka, the one who called you.

369
00:18:16,538 --> 00:18:18,038
Oh, I'm sorry.

370
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:19,438
Right...

371
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:20,538
I've got your name down

372
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:23,938
as the one who reported the incident, right here.

373
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:26,138
Is he really all right?

374
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:30,638
I'm just wondering why a Mr. Adachi and Mr. Kahara

375
00:18:30,638 --> 00:18:32,838
is at the Tanaka residence?

376
00:18:32,838 --> 00:18:37,438
Also, how is everyone connected with the woman victim?

377
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:41,038
She's a customer of the shop where Fuga and I work at.

378
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,938
We're hosts who brought Akane

379
00:18:44,938 --> 00:18:46,638
who said she wanted to forest bathe

380
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:48,338
to the mountains here by car.

381
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:49,638
You're hosts?

382
00:18:49,638 --> 00:18:52,438
Yes, he got lost yesterday

383
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:54,838
and the car ran out of gas.

384
00:18:54,838 --> 00:18:57,538
So, we spent the night here last night

385
00:18:57,538 --> 00:18:59,938
at Mrs. Tanaka's house.

386
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,838
Where are the members of your family Mrs. Tanaka?

387
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:05,838
They're not here.

388
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:08,938
Ten years ago after my grandson left,

389
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:11,438
I've been living here alone.

390
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:15,338
And you folks just happened to be here...

391
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:17,538
Just like those men there.

392
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:20,538
We got lost on the way to the camping site,

393
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:22,738
and on top of that, we ended up with a flat tire.

394
00:19:22,738 --> 00:19:25,238
We asked granny to put us up for the night.

395
00:19:25,238 --> 00:19:28,138
A little before they did.

396
00:19:28,138 --> 00:19:29,938
Then it's the same as usual,

397
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:32,538
you've found yourself involved in a case?

398
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,638
Well, I guess so.

399
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:38,338
Ran out of gas and a flat tire.

400
00:19:40,838 --> 00:19:44,338
Let's see, Conan, was it?

401
00:19:44,338 --> 00:19:45,438
I'll be honest with you,

402
00:19:45,438 --> 00:19:47,438
but I'm sure that you should go and have yourself blessed.

403
00:19:47,438 --> 00:19:50,438
I just know that you're possessed by something that's not too good.

404
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:54,038
Do you have any idea who the culprit may be?

405
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:56,138
Well, not really.

406
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:58,838
Although it was raining at the time of the murder,

407
00:19:58,838 --> 00:20:00,438
there are no footprints around the house,

408
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:02,138
except for the front entrance area,

409
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:04,138
and no murder weapon has been found either.

410
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:08,038
On top of that, no suspicious person has been witnessed.

411
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:10,338
In other words, the killer, as well as the murder weapon

412
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:13,838
are probably in this house.

413
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:14,938
Huh?

414
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:17,738
Hey...

415
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:20,738
Don't tell me that you're suspecting us?

416
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:21,838
It can't be helped.

417
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:22,938
Huh?

418
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:26,038
Because we're the ones who brought her here.

419
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:27,738
-But... -Of course,

420
00:20:27,738 --> 00:20:30,738
it's not that I suspect just you two.

421
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:33,138
I will have to interrogate everyone here.

422
00:20:33,138 --> 00:20:36,038
One by one, about the incident.

423
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:38,538
Let me start with the one who first found her, Mr. Raito Adachi?

424
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,938
Yeah. That's the name that I use at the shop and...

425
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:42,738
You gotta be kidding!

426
00:20:42,738 --> 00:20:44,038
Interrogation without any proof,

427
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:46,138
and you're treating us like we're the killer?

428
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:50,138
It's not that I'm treating you like the killer.

429
00:20:50,138 --> 00:20:51,938
Hey... Fuga.

430
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:54,938
I'm not going to say a word unless you come up

431
00:20:54,938 --> 00:20:57,838
with some evidence or the murder weapon!

432
00:20:57,838 --> 00:21:00,838
That's fine but taking that kind of an attitude,

433
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:03,438
will give you a bad impression.

434
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:10,338
A saw, a knife, chopper and two kitchen knives.

435
00:21:10,338 --> 00:21:12,238
Dr. Agasa...

436
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,738
Why do you have so many things

437
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:15,938
that could be potential weapons?

438
00:21:15,938 --> 00:21:20,138
Most naturally because we came here to camp.

439
00:21:20,138 --> 00:21:21,638
You two...

440
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:24,438
really have nothing on you?

441
00:21:24,438 --> 00:21:27,838
No, you already checked our body a while ago too, didn't you?

442
00:21:30,138 --> 00:21:31,138
And in this house there are...

443
00:21:31,138 --> 00:21:34,938
three kitchen knives, a hoe, a sickle,

444
00:21:34,938 --> 00:21:37,038
an ax and a scissors.

445
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:38,838
Is this really everything?

446
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:40,538
The only other thing left

447
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:43,038
is my grandson's tool box in the shed.

448
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:45,738
I'm sure it's already rusty though.

449
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,038
That... that's a lie!

450
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:49,538
Huh? What did you just say?

451
00:21:49,538 --> 00:21:52,038
I... I saw her this morning.

452
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:54,438
I noticed a strange sound when going back

453
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,738
to my room from the restroom.

454
00:22:00,638 --> 00:22:03,038
I heard the sound coming from the kitchen,

455
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:04,138
so I took a peek...

456
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:09,038
And saw granny...

457
00:22:12,438 --> 00:22:14,238
here...

458
00:22:14,238 --> 00:22:16,238
sharpening a knife!

459
00:22:16,238 --> 00:22:18,338
Her hair was dishevelled!

460
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:21,038
It was a kitchen knife with a bright red handle!

461
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:22,838
She looked like an ogre!

462
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:56,738
"Next Episode" -But I saw for sure with my own eyes.

463
00:23:56,738 --> 00:23:58,738
Maybe you were just flustered at seeing me

464
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:00,738
who resembles a mountain crone

465
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:04,338
and saw an illusion of some kind?

466
00:24:04,338 --> 00:24:08,138
There's an inscription under the name of the maker of the knife...

467
00:24:08,138 --> 00:24:09,138
Shota?

468
00:24:09,138 --> 00:24:11,038
Last night the water of this aquarium

469
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:12,438
was filled to this water stain here,

470
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:14,438
but the water's decreased quite a lot!

471
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:17,738
I see, that's why the culprit used a hammer.

472
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:18,938
Next Conan!

473
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:23,138
"The Knife of the Mountain Crone Part Two."

474
00:24:38,938 --> 00:24:41,138
Next Conan's Hint:

475
00:24:41,138 --> 00:24:43,038
Goldfish Aquarium.

476
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:44,238
We encounter an incident involving a mountain crone in the mountains.

477
00:24:44,238 --> 00:24:45,238
Officer Yamamura appears and the case reaches a climax,

478
00:24:45,238 --> 00:24:46,238
just a step to being solved!

479
00:24:46,238 --> 00:24:48,038
This story is certainly full of mountain, heights and climax.
