1
00:00:00,922 --> 00:00:02,321
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,322 --> 00:00:04,221
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,222 --> 00:00:05,921
Open your mouth wide and say "Ah".

4
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:07,321
How will this quite amusing action

5
00:00:07,322 --> 00:00:08,921
play a role in today's case?

6
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:10,321
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,322 --> 00:00:12,021
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:14,422
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:08,635 --> 00:02:11,435
"Thistle butterflies."

10
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:34,735
"The Fatal Ah."

11
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:42,502
Please hurry up, Mr. Mouri. Can't you run faster?

12
00:02:42,503 --> 00:02:44,202
I'm doing my best.

13
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:47,002
Why don't you try to lose more weight, Ms. Nitta?

14
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:48,802
Huh, did you say something?

15
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:51,403
Maybe something's wrong with my hearing aid.

16
00:02:53,803 --> 00:02:56,303
Way back. The room at the very end.

17
00:03:15,803 --> 00:03:17,902
It is a remodeled gun.

18
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:21,102
He is a famous detective.

19
00:03:21,103 --> 00:03:24,502
He'll solve the case in the wink of an eye.

20
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:27,002
-A cold? -No, I'm okay.

21
00:03:27,003 --> 00:03:29,902
Watch out, because they say "Physician heal thyself."

22
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:32,702
Oh, come on, I am not a doctor.

23
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:35,802
I'm just a dentist's assistant, that's all.

24
00:03:35,803 --> 00:03:38,502
Well, let us continue.

25
00:03:38,503 --> 00:03:42,102
Ms. Nitta heard what sounded like a gun just before 3pm.

26
00:03:42,103 --> 00:03:44,502
To be exact, it was 2.45pm.

27
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:50,902
When I woke up from my daily nap, and Ms. Suzuki came.

28
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:52,202
A crust of bread?

29
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:56,402
Yes, I made sandwiches for today's lunch

30
00:03:56,403 --> 00:04:00,502
and happened to remember that you like to feed the carps in the pond.

31
00:04:00,503 --> 00:04:03,502
Thank you. I am going there today, too.

32
00:04:03,503 --> 00:04:05,002
I appreciate it.

33
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:06,302
Aren't you going to the dental clinic today?

34
00:04:06,303 --> 00:04:08,202
I took a day off.

35
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:11,102
Let's have a tea break after I come back.

36
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:12,903
I will be back after 3pm.

37
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,702
What is that sound?

38
00:04:15,703 --> 00:04:17,902
It came from Mr. Yamamoto's room.

39
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:19,602
Wasn't it the sound of a gun?

40
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:20,802
No way.

41
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,002
You are right.

42
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:24,403
It can't be in broad daylight in a place like this.

43
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:29,202
The carps must be starving and waiting for me.

44
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,402
See you later.

45
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,802
Afterwards, I returned a little bit before 3pm and...

46
00:04:33,803 --> 00:04:36,302
Has any change come over your neighbor since then?

47
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:38,003
No, nothing.

48
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:44,303
Hello, Mr. Nakanishi.

49
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:48,802
He used to live in your room.

50
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:50,002
Huh?

51
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:52,303
The door is left open.

52
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,702
It looks like a will.

53
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:09,302
I've heard that Mr. Nakanishi and Mr. Yamamoto were best friends.

54
00:05:09,303 --> 00:05:12,102
Even if Mr. Yamamoto did commit suicide,

55
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,902
isn't it strange that his best friend went home

56
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:16,702
without calling the police or the ambulance?

57
00:05:16,703 --> 00:05:19,002
You mean he left as if fleeing?

58
00:05:19,003 --> 00:05:21,702
That's right. I'm sure there's something to this.

59
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:25,302
He's got to be the killer no matter how you look at it.

60
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:28,502
He is surely a suspicious man.

61
00:05:28,503 --> 00:05:31,503
I will ask Inspector Megure to come.

62
00:05:32,003 --> 00:05:35,902
Ran asked me to buy some cakes and I'm on my way back,

63
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:38,802
I happened to see Ms. Nitta who was running to police,

64
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:39,803
That's why I am here.

65
00:05:39,804 --> 00:05:41,402
It is addressed to Mr. Nakanishi.

66
00:05:41,403 --> 00:05:43,202
It says he will commit suicide in apology

67
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:45,402
of not being able to return the money borrowed.

68
00:05:45,403 --> 00:05:49,002
But the will is typed with a word processor.

69
00:05:49,003 --> 00:05:52,502
We can't conclude that Mr. Yamamoto wrote it himself.

70
00:05:52,503 --> 00:05:54,602
What bothers me most...

71
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:56,702
Is despite having found the dead body of his childhood friend,

72
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:59,203
why did he just split without informing anyone about it?

73
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:01,302
Yes.

74
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:03,002
I didn't think such a thing would happen in broad daylight like this.

75
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:04,602
Back then I was...

76
00:06:04,603 --> 00:06:07,302
The intuition of an ex-police officer tells me that

77
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:10,002
the murderer was Nakanishi, who was Mr. Yamamoto's childhood friend.

78
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,802
The motive was money trouble between them.

79
00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:14,102
Mr. Mouri.

80
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:18,102
On the basis of the autopsy, we can't say it was murder.

81
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:22,402
The reason is that no trace of resistance was found at all.

82
00:06:22,403 --> 00:06:24,402
No resistance?

83
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:27,102
If a gun had been thrust into his mouth,

84
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,202
scars resulting from resistance

85
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:31,802
would've been left on his teeth or lips.

86
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:33,202
Since none were found,

87
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:37,202
we can't help believing that he opened his mouth voluntarily.

88
00:06:37,203 --> 00:06:39,103
Take a look at this, Inspector.

89
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:42,902
True, there are no traces of struggle.

90
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,702
You're probably right, but...

91
00:06:45,703 --> 00:06:49,302
The butterflies are called thistle butterflies, it says,

92
00:06:49,303 --> 00:06:50,402
and this plant is...

93
00:06:50,403 --> 00:06:52,302
We don't have time to be wasting with you.

94
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:54,403
Don't bother us. Get lost!

95
00:06:58,103 --> 00:07:00,302
Inspector, as the result of verification,

96
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:02,302
we found that Mr. Yamamoto had been arrested in the past

97
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:04,503
on charges of possessing a remodeled gun.

98
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:07,902
Ms. Suzuki, his next door neighbor, says that

99
00:07:07,903 --> 00:07:09,102
he would burst in rage

100
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:12,002
when there were complaints about the volume of his T.V.

101
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:14,602
and his only purpose in life seemed to be butterflies.

102
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:18,302
Inspector, I can't imagine that such an insensitive man

103
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:20,902
would kill himself over debts.

104
00:07:20,903 --> 00:07:22,302
Mr. Mouri.

105
00:07:22,303 --> 00:07:24,202
We don't understand this.

106
00:07:24,203 --> 00:07:27,102
It was about 2.45pm when Ms. Suzuki and Ms. Nittta

107
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:29,002
heard the sound of the gun.

108
00:07:29,003 --> 00:07:32,802
It was a little after 3pm, when Ms. Nitta saw Nakanishi.

109
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:35,302
Let's suppose that Nakanishi is the murderer.

110
00:07:35,303 --> 00:07:39,702
What was he doing during this period of 15 minutes?

111
00:07:39,703 --> 00:07:40,802
If he were the real murderer,

112
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:45,202
he would have left the scene as soon as he could.

113
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:48,902
Inspector, here is Mr. Nakanishi.

114
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:52,103
"Saburo Nakanishi (30), Yamamoto's childhood friend."

115
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:56,302
See? I came here at the promised time of 3pm.

116
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:57,802
When I entered his room,

117
00:07:57,803 --> 00:08:01,202
Yamamoto was already on the sofa, dead.

118
00:08:01,203 --> 00:08:03,402
You found his dead body,

119
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:06,002
but you're his childhood friend, aren't you?

120
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:09,002
Why didn't you immediately inform the police?

121
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:12,102
I loaned him money.

122
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:14,102
I was afraid that you might think I killed him

123
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:16,102
because of money trouble and ran away.

124
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:18,002
No, don't lie.

125
00:08:18,003 --> 00:08:21,402
In order not to leave your fingerprints and the gun power smoke behind,

126
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:23,202
you wrapped your gun with a towel.

127
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,902
Around 2.45pm,

128
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:27,602
you thrust your gun into Mr. Yamamoto's mouth

129
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:30,503
and shot him to make it look like suicide.

130
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:36,602
Two people heard the report of the gunfire.

131
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:37,902
Wait a second.

132
00:08:37,903 --> 00:08:42,002
How could I thrust the gun into Yamamoto's mouth?

133
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:44,002
Are you saying he just waited for the gun to be fired

134
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:45,602
with his mouth wide open?

135
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:49,802
Well, it's possible to think that you waited

136
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:52,902
for Mr. Yamamoto to yawn or something. Yes!

137
00:08:52,903 --> 00:08:55,602
He was in the midst of being pursued by collectors.

138
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,602
Do you think he had the composure to yawn with his mouth wide open

139
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,002
in a situation like that?

140
00:08:59,003 --> 00:09:01,302
I see your point, but...

141
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:04,002
What Mr. Nakanishi says is right.

142
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:07,002
It is unreasonable to say that this man did it.

143
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:09,702
Let me ask you one more thing.

144
00:09:09,703 --> 00:09:13,802
At the estimated time of Mr. Yamamoto's death around 2.45pm,

145
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,702
tell me where were you and what you were doing.

146
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:18,502
In the taxi coming here.

147
00:09:18,503 --> 00:09:20,402
What is the name of the taxi company?

148
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:24,502
I don't remember. It was a blue car.

149
00:09:24,503 --> 00:09:27,302
A picture of a dove or a mouse was painted on it.

150
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:28,603
I will check it.

151
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:37,302
He is just making useless efforts to buy time.

152
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:41,002
That man is sure unlucky to have to confront Mr. Mouri.

153
00:09:41,003 --> 00:09:43,102
He has no way out.

154
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:45,602
Mr. Mouri, I am going to have tea with Ms. Nitta.

155
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:47,502
If it's okay with you, please join us.

156
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,402
Thank you. Let's have the cake I bought.

157
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:53,402
Darn, I can't get money back.

158
00:09:53,403 --> 00:09:56,302
If Mr. Yamamoto had indeed killed himself,

159
00:09:56,303 --> 00:10:00,902
I wonder what he had in mind for the butterflies after his death.

160
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:03,402
He treasured the butterflies and raised them.

161
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:07,602
There must be something else I haven't noticed.

162
00:10:07,603 --> 00:10:09,503
What is it?

163
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:17,624
I am sorry to have kept you waiting.

164
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,825
Now, let's have the cake.

165
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:24,324
Strawberries.

166
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:25,924
Open your mouth, Conan.

167
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,525
Come on, say ah.

168
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:35,524
Mr. Mouri, forget about business.

169
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:38,524
Here, have a strawberry!

170
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:41,424
No, thanks. I am a grownup.

171
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:43,724
Well, if you insist.

172
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:46,124
Conan, don't say anything about this to Ran.

173
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,425
Here, open your mouth.

174
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,925
What a loose fish.

175
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:03,324
Shall I add some brandy to your tea?

176
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:05,125
Great.

177
00:11:06,825 --> 00:11:08,824
A little while more, a little while more,

178
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:10,324
and just how long do I have to wait?

179
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:13,825
My men are looking desperately for it now, too.

180
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:17,924
This is Mr. Yamamoto's consultation ticket.

181
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:20,424
I wonder what Mr. Mouri is going to use it for.

182
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:22,124
I guess he wants to find out

183
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,224
if Mr. Yamamoto was consulting a dentist.

184
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:28,924
And, if he was, which dentist.

185
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:30,624
Thank you.

186
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:34,225
Yes, Mr. Nobuo Yamamoto. Your patient.

187
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:37,324
It was cancelled?

188
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:40,324
I will send Conan over, as my messenger,

189
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,425
so please explain it to him.

190
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,124
"Beika Taxi Corp."

191
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,625
"Shinjuku Wireless. Taisho Taxi."

192
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:01,024
Officer Chiba.

193
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:04,224
Did you find out which taxi Mr. Nakanishi rode?

194
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:09,024
Not yet, or Nakanishi could be lying.

195
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:14,124
Well, Pops says he has something he wants you to look over.

196
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,624
Pops, wake up please, Pops.

197
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,324
One more? Okay.

198
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:23,224
I am sorry, he seemed to enjoy drinking a lot,

199
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:25,024
so I couldn't help offering him more and more.

200
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:27,324
Pops, wake up!

201
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:28,824
Can you help me?

202
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:31,724
No more? No more strawberries and no more...

203
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:35,724
What a pity, Inspector, talk about unlucky.

204
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:37,924
Just what are you talking about?

205
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,224
It's about time we leave.

206
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:42,524
Come on, get up.

207
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:44,924
Hey, just where are you taking me?

208
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:48,624
Till we find the taxi you took, you're a suspect.

209
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,224
Nonsense. I've got nothing to do with it!

210
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:53,624
You are a poor loser.

211
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:57,825
Why don't you resign and admit what you did?

212
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,124
That's what I'd like to say, but...

213
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:08,324
Inspector, though Mr. Yamamoto's death is due to homicide,

214
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:10,324
that man has nothing to do with it.

215
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:14,624
Mr. Yamamoto was killed under the pretense of suicide.

216
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,124
Pretense? Who did?

217
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,524
Any evidence?

218
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:22,624
As you see, Mr. Yamamoto loved butterflies.

219
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:26,824
He would've thought of what would happen to his butterflies if he died,

220
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:30,724
so he would've released them before he killed himself.

221
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:34,624
Again, that's where Mr. Yamamoto was sitting.

222
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,424
If he fires the gun from there,

223
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:39,924
the bullet would go through the glass case and shatter it.

224
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:43,424
At worst, it may harm the butterflies.

225
00:13:43,425 --> 00:13:47,124
He would never kill himself in a place like this.

226
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,724
True.

227
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:51,924
Mr. Yamamoto called the dental clinic

228
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:54,124
to cancel the appointment around 2.30pm.

229
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:58,124
In other words, he was killed between 2.30pm and 3pm

230
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,224
when Mr. Nakanishi found his body.

231
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:03,424
It was 2.45pm.

232
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,824
Some people must've surely heard the gunshot.

233
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,824
But, before that,

234
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:13,224
how did the killer manage to put the gun in Mr. Yamamoto's mouth?

235
00:14:13,225 --> 00:14:18,224
Mr. Yamamoto opened his mouth as the killer told him to.

236
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,624
Open his mouth like he was told to?

237
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,424
If he was a child, maybe, but he's an adult.

238
00:14:24,425 --> 00:14:28,524
There was a person who could manipulate him that far.

239
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:30,824
Who could it be?

240
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:34,124
Inspector, if someone told you to open your mouth wide,

241
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,524
who would you open it obediently for?

242
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:37,924
Obediently?

243
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:40,124
My wife, grandma...

244
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,224
Hey, open your mouth wide!

245
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:44,624
Open wide, ah...

246
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,625
A doctor!

247
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:47,324
That's right, a doctor.

248
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:50,624
Almost all dentists, in particular would say so.

249
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,824
A dentist is the murderer?

250
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,824
The dentist visited this room?

251
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:58,324
No. The person who came here was working at a dental clinic.

252
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:01,124
And, that person had met Mr. Yamamoto before

253
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,624
and knew about his debts.

254
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,524
Who is that person?

255
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:07,724
Ms. Yumi Suzuki.

256
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:11,724
You are working at Beika Dental Clinic as an assistant.

257
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:15,124
Mr. Yamamoto was seeing a dentist there.

258
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:18,424
I see thin lines on the skin behind your ears.

259
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:20,624
They must be traces of the rubber supporter of the masks

260
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,624
you have been wearing for years.

261
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,624
You told the clinic today that you had urgent business to take care

262
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,325
and took a day off.

263
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:29,924
You eavesdropped that.

264
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:33,324
Mr. Nakanishi was coming to collect his money at 3pm.

265
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:37,424
You decided to carry out your prearranged plan.

266
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:39,324
A prearranged plan?

267
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:43,124
You moved into this condominium about two months ago.

268
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,824
You moved in right after Mr. Yamamoto

269
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:48,824
started going to the clinic you were working at.

270
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:50,924
Your purpose was to pretend that you just happened to meet Mr. Yamamoto.

271
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:53,424
You wanted to approach him.

272
00:15:53,425 --> 00:15:58,024
And you exchanged words with Mr. Yamamoto as you had planned.

273
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:01,924
You found that Mr. Yamamoto was up to his ears in debt.

274
00:16:01,925 --> 00:16:04,424
Taking advantage of this, you wrote a scenario of

275
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:07,224
"a suicide caused by debts."

276
00:16:07,225 --> 00:16:09,024
On a weekday afternoon like today,

277
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:13,224
there are only a few residents in this condominium who are at home.

278
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:15,224
Perhaps, a little after 2.30pm,

279
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:19,325
Ms. Nitta removed her hearing aid and took her daily nap.

280
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,524
Today is your consultation day, isn't it?

281
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:27,124
Let me have a look at it.

282
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,124
I'll do it free of charge because you're my neighbor.

283
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,725
Hurry, let me in.

284
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,424
Yes. I have some business to attend to,

285
00:16:35,425 --> 00:16:38,125
so please cancel my appointment.

286
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,425
Drinks later, okay? It'll be over soon.

287
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,825
Let's begin, shall we?

288
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:15,324
Please close your eyes, since the lighting is too bright.

289
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,824
Here we go. Please open your mouth.

290
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:19,524
Ah.

291
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:21,525
It'll be over soon.

292
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:31,824
You set a tape recorder which had recorded

293
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:33,924
the sound of gunfire in advance,

294
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:37,324
and went out to see Ms. Nitta with some crumbs of bread.

295
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:41,724
At 2.45pm when Mr. Yamamoto is supposed to have died,

296
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:43,224
you were with Ms. Nitta.

297
00:17:43,225 --> 00:17:46,424
In short, you made an alibi for yourself.

298
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:49,924
Ms. Nitta went out to feed the carps.

299
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:51,925
You saw her off...

300
00:17:59,025 --> 00:18:02,424
And Mr. Yamamoto "died" at 2.45pm.

301
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:04,924
Furthermore, you deliberately planned to let Mr. Nakanishi

302
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:06,824
find his dead body at 3pm.

303
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:09,624
In short, it was a disguised suicide.

304
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,424
No, I didn't do it.

305
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:16,024
I do not have a reason for killing Mr. Yamamoto.

306
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:17,424
Yes, you do.

307
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:19,524
I have checked it, Ms. Suzuki.

308
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:24,924
Your husband had a traffic accident 10 years ago in his homeland, Gifu,

309
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:28,325
and is currently still unconscious in the hospital.

310
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:38,825
Oh, it's a Gifu butterfly.

311
00:18:56,925 --> 00:18:59,224
The driver was Mr. Nobuo Yamamoto.

312
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:01,524
He was distracted by butterflies and failed to keep his eyes on the road.

313
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:03,824
Moreover, he was drunk.

314
00:19:03,825 --> 00:19:06,724
Then, he happens to visit your clinic for dental treatment

315
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:08,024
and meet you again.

316
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:10,424
You decide to take revenge for what he did to your husband.

317
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:12,524
-Am I wrong? -You're wrong.

318
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:14,624
It's true that

319
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,524
Yamamoto took my husband's profession as a dentist away from him

320
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:20,024
and ruined his whole life.

321
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,124
But, I didn't kill him.

322
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,025
I've never been to this room either.

323
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:27,924
I seem to have caught a cold.

324
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:30,024
Please excuse me.

325
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:32,124
I would like to say, "Please take good care of yourself."

326
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,724
But Ms. Yumi, that isn't a cold.

327
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:38,224
Perhaps, it's hay fever.

328
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:39,724
Hay fever?

329
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:42,124
Yeah, hay fever caused by mugwort.

330
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,024
Hay fever caused by mugwort?

331
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:46,624
I found it in a book in this room.

332
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:50,024
It says a thistle butterfly lives on mugwort.

333
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:53,724
Mugwort is a favorite for the thistle butterfly.

334
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:57,824
But it can cause hay fever in human, it says.

335
00:19:57,825 --> 00:20:02,024
One more thing, your hair is a bit shiny.

336
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:04,824
It is probably the powder from the wings of butterflies.

337
00:20:04,825 --> 00:20:08,624
Mr. Mouri, I am living next door.

338
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,524
Mugwort powder might have flown and come to my room.

339
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:13,924
Some butterflies might have escaped and alighted on my body

340
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:15,424
although I didn't notice them.

341
00:20:15,425 --> 00:20:17,525
Conan, bring me that thing.

342
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,824
Do you know what is this?

343
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:30,324
Yes. It is a dental mirror to examine the inner side of teeth.

344
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:31,624
Though I knew it was a rude request,

345
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,224
I borrowed this from Beika Dental Clinic.

346
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:36,924
It has the initials of Beika Dental Clinic "BDC" on it

347
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:39,524
and they told me that it is special ordered.

348
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:42,524
Have you ever met a person who wanted to own it

349
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:45,424
or a person who went home with it?

350
00:20:45,425 --> 00:20:47,324
No. None.

351
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:51,324
Inspector, there is a coffee cup under the table.

352
00:20:51,325 --> 00:20:53,525
Please have a look.

353
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,624
It looks like an ordinary coffee to me.

354
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,724
What about it?

355
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:03,524
There is a stir stick inside.

356
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:05,925
The stick, please pull it out slowly.

357
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:20,825
Why is it here? Why?

358
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:34,524
You're the only one who could've brought

359
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:36,524
the dental mirror into this room.

360
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:38,225
What would you say?

361
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,724
Yamamoto came to our clinic.

362
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:48,224
Of course he had forgotten my face and name.

363
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:49,724
One thing I couldn't forgive him for

364
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,624
was that he drove drunk to our clinic,

365
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:57,824
despite promising never drink and drive again.

366
00:21:57,825 --> 00:22:00,924
He showed no apologetic signs for what he had done.

367
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:03,124
Thinking of it, made me feel sorry for my husband.

368
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,224
That's why I...

369
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:07,725
I am sorry.

370
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,324
"Mouri Detective Agency."

371
00:23:42,325 --> 00:23:45,824
You see, I must explain to you about the cake.

372
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:48,424
I didn't mean to lie to you, Ran.

373
00:23:48,425 --> 00:23:50,125
Please open the door.

374
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:53,024
Hey, she has turned off the switch.

375
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:56,024
Ran must have turned off her switch towards us too.

376
00:23:56,025 --> 00:23:58,125
Is this the karma for "ah"?

377
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:02,224
"Next Episode"

378
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:03,524
"I've grown tired of living."

379
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,024
A will?

380
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:08,324
Even if you lie, some sort of evidence will be left behind.

381
00:24:08,325 --> 00:24:10,025
I've found the evidence!

382
00:24:11,225 --> 00:24:15,124
The problem is, how can I prove this attempted scheme?

383
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,325
What can I do?

384
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:21,325
I can't let anything like this happen!

385
00:24:23,225 --> 00:24:24,624
Next Conan,

386
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:28,725
"Man Hindered by a Steel-Frame."

387
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,524
Next Conan's Hint:

388
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:49,124
"Amnesia."

389
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:50,524
Officer Chiba, do you remember today's murderer?

390
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:52,124
-Today's almond jelly? -No, murderer.

391
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,525
-Did I eat it? -What?
