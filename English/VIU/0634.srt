1
00:00:01,328 --> 00:00:03,028
Like the fog clears.

2
00:00:03,028 --> 00:00:05,128
Let's see through love and crime as well.

3
00:00:05,128 --> 00:00:06,728
A small restaurant with a taste of the Showa Era to it.

4
00:00:06,728 --> 00:00:08,728
An ingenious trick in a cramped place.

5
00:00:08,728 --> 00:00:10,428
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:12,228
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:14,528
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,396 --> 00:02:01,196
"Scene of the Crime is a Super Cramped Shop"

9
00:02:06,196 --> 00:02:09,096
Come in! We have special discounts!

10
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,296
Come in!

11
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,096
"Satsuki"

12
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,696
Geez.

13
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:17,196
The main race was really a throw off.

14
00:02:18,196 --> 00:02:20,196
I didn't make it.

15
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:21,696
With such a dark horse like that making goal,

16
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:25,196
there's no hope of winning.

17
00:02:25,196 --> 00:02:28,296
Are they all here for the Tohoto Derby too?

18
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:32,296
A lot of derby fans hang out here on Saturdays.

19
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:35,896
We come here directly after the race is over.

20
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:38,596
We talk about winning, losing and the like.

21
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:40,196
I see.

22
00:02:40,196 --> 00:02:45,096
Well, you see, same here.

23
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:47,996
Huh? May I see it?

24
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:50,596
Sure!

25
00:02:50,596 --> 00:02:53,096
Trifecta of 1, 2, 3...

26
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:55,796
This is today's long shot win!

27
00:02:55,796 --> 00:02:57,596
-What? -What?

28
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,696
Right!

29
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:04,896
My, sir, how wonderful.

30
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:10,196
So, I shall foot everybody's bill tonight!

31
00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:11,996
But this ticket...

32
00:03:11,996 --> 00:03:16,096
Ma'am! Give everyone a drink each to start!

33
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,896
My, my. You sure are generous, sir!

34
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:22,896
It's no big deal!

35
00:03:26,396 --> 00:03:28,896
What was that?

36
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:33,096
Oh, this?

37
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:35,696
It's something I devised.

38
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:37,496
This shop is so cramped

39
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:40,396
that using this makes moving around easier.

40
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:44,796
See!

41
00:03:44,796 --> 00:03:46,796
I see.

42
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:53,596
I sure wish I get to experience some kind of windfall, too.

43
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:57,096
I thought you were getting retirement pay soon?

44
00:03:57,096 --> 00:03:59,296
Retirement pay?

45
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:02,496
No, no, it's just chicken feed.

46
00:04:02,496 --> 00:04:04,496
Hey, hey.

47
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:08,696
Take me to Hawaii with that money, won't you?

48
00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:09,996
Come off it.

49
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:15,696
You're quite extravagant, aren't you, Mr. Richie?

50
00:04:15,696 --> 00:04:18,696
If you wish, would you like me to serve you more expensive liquor

51
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:22,696
than the cheap one you're drinking now?

52
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,096
No, thank you.

53
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:27,796
You go ahead to Shonan Hawaiian Center or something, okay?

54
00:04:27,796 --> 00:04:29,296
True.

55
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:34,296
Since I go to that hotel every year to do my recitals,

56
00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:36,196
so it may be a good idea!

57
00:04:36,196 --> 00:04:38,196
There you go!

58
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:40,196
Recitals?

59
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:45,396
I teach Japanese dancing.

60
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:59,596
Really, you get carried away every time you get drunk.

61
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:01,996
Since you're doing recitals,

62
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:05,996
I'm sure you're prospering with your classes too.

63
00:05:09,196 --> 00:05:10,796
No, no.

64
00:05:10,796 --> 00:05:15,996
She slipped at her recital, did a grand leg split and fell!

65
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:19,096
There's no way that a class with a teacher like that would prosper.

66
00:05:20,396 --> 00:05:23,696
Why do you remember such useless things?

67
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:25,496
Recitals my foot.

68
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:27,996
You don't know where you stand.

69
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:31,696
What did you just say? Try again!

70
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:35,696
Are you sure you want to talk to me like that?

71
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:39,296
Come, come, cool head.

72
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:45,596
It looks delicious.

73
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:46,696
Yes.

74
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:50,696
I just happened to come into this shop when I came here.

75
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:55,696
At present, she's like a mother and makes these dishes for me.

76
00:05:57,096 --> 00:05:59,996
He came to Tokyo wanting to be a cook

77
00:05:59,996 --> 00:06:02,196
for a high class Japanese restaurant.

78
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:05,696
But he couldn't make his dream come true, you see.

79
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:09,096
Are you still at the fish market I introduced you to?

80
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:11,696
Yes, thanks to you.

81
00:06:11,696 --> 00:06:14,496
You take care of people, don't you?

82
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:16,296
If one wants to be a fish vendor,

83
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:18,996
you've got to have an eye for fish, don't you?

84
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:21,796
Right, Mr. Shinohara?

85
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:26,296
Yes, I'm learning much!

86
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:29,896
I see. That's why he got a job at the fish market.

87
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:34,596
By the way, why are your slacks wet?

88
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:37,596
When I was walking down the alley a while ago...

89
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:41,496
The shop owner accidentally splash water from a bucket on him.

90
00:06:41,496 --> 00:06:44,096
Huh? How'd you know?

91
00:06:44,096 --> 00:06:45,996
You mean she did it again?

92
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:48,296
I mean, she doesn't care what method she uses.

93
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:51,596
She always does that to get those who feel generous

94
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:53,096
after winning the horse races to come to her shop.

95
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:56,596
You keep it up and one day the heavens are going to punish you.

96
00:06:56,596 --> 00:06:59,696
Stop talking stink about her!

97
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:02,496
She's the one who saved me when I came to Tokyo to work,

98
00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:06,496
but couldn't find anything and was at a loss what to do!

99
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:08,896
No need to get so upset.

100
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,996
I've been feeling a draft for a while now.

101
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:14,496
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:16,896
This place is made of wood and tin patched together

103
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:20,096
so wind blows in from this space.

104
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:23,796
I'm getting chilly too, so I'm going to the bathroom.

105
00:07:23,796 --> 00:07:25,896
Come on, come on,

106
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:27,696
the lady's going through!

107
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:30,096
I guess we've got no choice since the shop's so cramped.

108
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:33,596
"Satsuki"

109
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:36,696
Now that I've stood up,

110
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:39,896
I guess I'll go buy myself some cigarettes.

111
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:41,396
I've got to go to the automatic teller

112
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:43,296
to withdraw money before it closes.

113
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,596
I guess I'll go get a puff too.

114
00:07:55,396 --> 00:07:57,196
Cigarettes, cigarettes...

115
00:07:57,196 --> 00:07:59,196
Huh?

116
00:07:59,196 --> 00:08:01,096
Was it here?

117
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:16,996
Dad's recently drinking in this area.

118
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:23,496
It's a wonder how they can drink with so much smoke around.

119
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:25,396
Isn't that Pops?

120
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:28,596
Oh, right.

121
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:30,796
Taking a puff in a place like this?

122
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:34,396
Huh? What're you all doing?

123
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:36,796
So you've all come back.

124
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:47,496
Ma'am!

125
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,596
Ma'am, get a hold of yourself!

126
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,896
Ma'am!

127
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:53,717
What?

128
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:58,966
That's more or less and rough summary of what happened.

129
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:02,866
A stab through the chest is the cause of death.

130
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:04,466
The name Satsuki was carved on the handle of the knife

131
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:07,266
that is the murder weapon.

132
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:09,866
It seems that all the knives that the owner

133
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:13,166
used at this shop had the same name carved on the handles.

134
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,866
There were no signs of things being taken from the shop.

135
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:20,566
Robbery seems very unlikely.

136
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:23,966
And, what brings you here, Mr. Mouri?

137
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:26,866
Yes, sir. I won by a long shot,

138
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,066
so I was treating the customers here.

139
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:32,366
You seemed to be having a lot of fun.

140
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:35,266
No, not really.

141
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:38,766
And, when the crime occurred all of us including me,

142
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:40,766
were all outside the shop.

143
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:45,266
I see. Only the owner was in the shop alone.

144
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:47,266
And it's not possible to look inside from outside

145
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:49,766
since the window is smoked.

146
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:50,766
Yes.

147
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:56,366
So it means that only the customers knew she was alone.

148
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:59,166
So while everybody else was outside,

149
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:03,166
one of the customers killed her.

150
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:06,066
Okay, let's hear them out then.

151
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:11,066
What do you mean you want to hear us out?

152
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:12,566
Judging from the circumstances,

153
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:18,166
it's highly likely that one of you is the culprit.

154
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,466
Don't be ridiculous!

155
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:23,166
So, please tell us where and what you were doing

156
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:28,066
during the 5 minutes that the incident took place.

157
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,266
Come to think of it, back then...

158
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,066
After everyone came out of the shop,

159
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,266
Ms. Oogi didn't come out from the shop for a while.

160
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:41,066
Ms. Oogi could've been waiting for a chance

161
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:43,166
to be alone with the owner.

162
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,866
Why would I want to do something like that?

163
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:48,766
Don't tell me that you borrowed money from the owner

164
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:51,566
because your classroom was about to go broke?

165
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:53,066
How dare you!

166
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:54,366
The owner was rumored

167
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:56,666
for being mellow like Buddha when lending money,

168
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,966
but was said to turn into a devil

169
00:10:57,966 --> 00:11:01,166
when she came to collect what she lent back.

170
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,266
I see.

171
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:06,766
Is it true that you borrowed money from the owner?

172
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:07,966
Yes.

173
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:10,966
She's been bugging me almost every day recently

174
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:12,466
demanding to have her money back.

175
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:15,166
Just today too, when I was about to leave the shop,

176
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,566
she closed in on me demanding to have me pay her back right away.

177
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:21,766
So, you were outraged, took the knife on the counter and...

178
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:25,766
No! Our argument was getting nowhere, so I left!

179
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:29,466
But, since she ended up like that...

180
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:31,666
I found it hard to come out and say anything about it!

181
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,966
Huh?

182
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:36,566
The sleeve of this person is wet.

183
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:38,266
Huh?

184
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:39,466
I see!

185
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,766
If I remember correctly, you're left-handed, right?

186
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:44,166
You used your left hand when you drank wine,

187
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,966
used your fan

188
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:49,266
or put the thumb tack back on!

189
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:51,666
Isn't your sleeve wet because you went to the restroom

190
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,366
and washed off the blood that splattered on you

191
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:57,166
when you stabbed the owner?

192
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,966
The faucet of the restroom was broken

193
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:01,066
and water came gushing out, that's all!

194
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:04,966
Just to be sure, have forensics check for luminol reaction.

195
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:08,566
Yes, sir. Come this way, please.

196
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:13,366
By the way, Mr. Nakamura.

197
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,466
What is it?

198
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:19,166
After saying that you were going to buy cigarettes and left the shop,

199
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,166
you turned right at the forked alley.

200
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,466
By the way, when you returned,

201
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:27,466
you came from the opposite direction, right?

202
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:30,066
The cigarette vending machine here and yet,

203
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:33,666
why did you return from the opposite side?

204
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,866
That's because the cigarettes of the vending machine were sold out

205
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:39,066
so I went to the cigarette shop on the main road.

206
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,266
Inspector!

207
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:42,866
I found the owner's notebook.

208
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:45,866
There's a monthly deposit of 100,000 made

209
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,666
under the name of Nakamura.

210
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,666
That amount's too large to be just for drinking.

211
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,666
Can you explain what this money is for?

212
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,966
Well, that's...

213
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:59,466
The owner had a hold of something I didn't want anybody to know.

214
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:01,166
Secret?

215
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:04,466
She was blackmailing me saying that

216
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:07,766
she would disclose to my company that I embezzled money

217
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:12,066
and was spending it on horse racing.

218
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,566
But I didn't do it!

219
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:17,066
I really went to the cigarette shop on the main street!

220
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,166
By the way, Mr. Shinohara.

221
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,266
Yes?

222
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:26,266
In her notes here, your name is mentioned here and there

223
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:29,266
and things like mackerel and squids are written.

224
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,266
Can you explain this?

225
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:33,166
I'm working part-time at the fish market,

226
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,666
so I used to take orders from her off and on.

227
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,666
Isn't it a record of the orders?

228
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:41,766
What were you doing during the 5 minutes that you left the shop?

229
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:43,566
Since I didn't have any cash on me,

230
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:46,966
I went to withdraw money from the automatic teller nearby.

231
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:49,366
I've got the breakdown sheet with me, too.

232
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:51,866
Here it is.

233
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:54,366
There's no mistake about the time either.

234
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,466
After leaving the shop,

235
00:13:56,466 --> 00:13:59,366
Mr. Shinohara walked towards the main street.

236
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:01,266
The automatic teller is here,

237
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:04,366
so it would be impossible for him to sneak back to the shop.

238
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:08,666
Given that there are no inconsistencies on his ATM receipt...

239
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,766
It seems impossible for him to have killed her.

240
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:19,366
Pops said that he treated everybody.

241
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:24,066
All the knives that are inside the stand are Japanese knives.

242
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,366
This is...

243
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:31,766
Juice?

244
00:14:31,766 --> 00:14:34,266
If I remember correctly, the owner was a non-drinker.

245
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,066
Brandy glass.

246
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:42,466
It hasn't been used yet.

247
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,566
The brandy bottle.

248
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:17,766
I see. I got it.

249
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:19,566
The trick of this case.

250
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:26,566
Hey, hey. Snoozing off during investigations?

251
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:28,866
I guess I'll attach a compact speaker on him now then.

252
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:30,866
Conan!

253
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:33,666
Don't go off on your own.

254
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,466
-Okay. -Inspector Megure.

255
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:37,966
As a result of the test performed by forensics,

256
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:41,466
no luminol reaction was found on Mr. Oogi's clothes.

257
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:45,166
I also confirmed with the cigarette vendor on the main street

258
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,266
and he testified that Mr. Nakamura

259
00:15:47,266 --> 00:15:48,866
did in fact come to make the purchase.

260
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,666
I guess I don't have to use it today.

261
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:54,866
Okay, everyone.

262
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:57,866
We'd like to hear more in detail at the station.

263
00:15:57,866 --> 00:16:00,966
Inspector, you don't need to do that.

264
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:04,066
I will solve the case right here this minute.

265
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:05,066
-What? -What?

266
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,766
Mr. Mouri, did you figure out who the culprit is?

267
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,266
Yes!

268
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:12,366
The brandy glass that was placed on the cutting board

269
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:15,566
told me who the culprit is!

270
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:18,666
Huh? Brandy?

271
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,766
Please give me a glass too, Inspector!

272
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:24,266
Oh no! He woke up!

273
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:29,766
Are you all right?

274
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:31,466
I'm fine.

275
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:34,666
Please look on top the counter of the shop.

276
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:38,466
Mr. Oogi had wine.

277
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:40,066
Mr. Nakamura had Japanese sake.

278
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:44,566
I had beer and Mr. Shinohara had sour.

279
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:46,566
And on the cutting board,

280
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:48,866
there're the glass cup of juice that the owner was drinking

281
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:52,366
and a still unused brandy glass.

282
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:54,666
So, what about it?

283
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:59,366
Who on earth did she take the brandy out for?

284
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:00,866
There was no customer who ordered brandy

285
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:03,666
before we left the shop.

286
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,466
It sure is strange.

287
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:07,966
Please look at the very top of the shelf.

288
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:11,466
The brandy bottle on the shelf

289
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:13,866
has been moved a bit, hasn't it?

290
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,566
It's most likely that the culprit after leaving the shop,

291
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:19,866
called the owner

292
00:17:19,866 --> 00:17:24,666
and ordered the expensive brandy that was on the very top shelf.

293
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,066
He probably lied and told her that

294
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:28,766
I would be treating everyone to that expensive brandy or something.

295
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:31,266
In order for the shop owner who is short, to get the brandy bottle,

296
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:34,266
she would have to tiptoe placing her body

297
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:36,266
close against the shelf and the wall.

298
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:37,966
The culprit with all this in mind

299
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:40,666
stuck a knife through the space in the wall.

300
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,066
He stuck the knife from outside the shop?

301
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,266
In back of the shop,

302
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,266
there's a space under the eaves where one person can pass through.

303
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:53,566
And in the patched wall made of wooden boards

304
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:56,266
and tin plates there are narrow spaces.

305
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:58,766
The culprit made the phone call from under the eaves

306
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:01,366
and lured the owner to come over to the wall.

307
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:04,866
Then, he stuck the knife through the space and killed her.

308
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:09,666
He probably stole the knife beforehand from the shop.

309
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:12,966
But when I found the owner,

310
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:16,366
she was facing the front of the counter face down.

311
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:18,966
Right. If she was stabbed near the wall,

312
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:20,866
she wouldn't fall that way, would she?

313
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:25,766
The chair that the owner was using was a chair that spins

314
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:28,166
in a cramped shop.

315
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,766
Ironically, just as the shop owner fell,

316
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:32,466
the chair spun round.

317
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:35,866
That's why she fell facing forward.

318
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:40,066
But a knife has a handle,

319
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:43,866
so I don't think it'll go through the space in the wall.

320
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:45,566
How about it, Officer Takagi?

321
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:48,766
Yes, sir. The handle would get stuck.

322
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:51,966
What is there was no handle on the knife?

323
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:53,366
What?

324
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,866
The handles of western knives

325
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:58,166
used to prepare western food are stuck together using screws.

326
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:01,366
But the handles of Japanese knives are easily removable

327
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:03,466
because all that needs to be done is to stick the blade into the handle.

328
00:19:04,366 --> 00:19:06,966
Inspector! It's just as Mr. Mouri says.

329
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:08,966
Which means...

330
00:19:08,966 --> 00:19:11,566
The culprit wanted us to find the body,

331
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:15,666
while he went into the counter under the pretense of being worried.

332
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:19,266
Then he put the handle back onto the blade

333
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:22,166
and carried the owner up.

334
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,566
No way...

335
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:25,266
No joke?

336
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:26,766
Yes.

337
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,066
The only one who could've carried out

338
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,166
the trick of using the removable handle of the knife

339
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,066
was the one who was the first to run over to her.

340
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:36,166
It's you, Mr. Shinohara.

341
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,366
But I was over at the automatic teller machine.

342
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:41,766
Right, he has an alibi.

343
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:43,266
No.

344
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,666
If he were to commit the crime from the back of the shop,

345
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,066
the automatic teller machine is quite close.

346
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:50,166
It wouldn't serve as alibi.

347
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,966
Being that he wanted to become a cook

348
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:53,866
for a high class Japanese restaurant...

349
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:55,366
He would've known that

350
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:57,766
the handle of the Japanese knife was removable.

351
00:19:57,766 --> 00:20:00,966
Do you have definite proof that I did it?

352
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,266
The envelope that you had

353
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:03,966
the paper of transaction details on that you showed us

354
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:06,266
was soiled, wasn't it?

355
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:11,566
That's rust from steel, isn't it?

356
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:12,766
When you committed the crime,

357
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:15,766
you were probably holding the blade without the handle on it

358
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:18,366
with a handkerchief wrapped around it.

359
00:20:18,366 --> 00:20:21,966
Therefore, the steel rust from the steel adhered to your handkerchief.

360
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:25,066
Unaware of this, you put the handkerchief

361
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:27,266
in the same pocket that the envelope was inside,

362
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:30,166
so the steel rust rubbed off on the envelope.

363
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,766
If we check the rust of the tin and that on the envelope,

364
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:35,566
I'm sure they will match.

365
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:39,366
But, why?

366
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:41,666
Wasn't she the one who helped you?

367
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,366
Wrong!

368
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:44,966
The reason she put on a nice front

369
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:46,866
and introduced me to the fish market

370
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:50,266
was to make me steal stuff from there!

371
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:51,966
What?

372
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:55,866
At first, all she demanded was damaged or left-over stuff.

373
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:58,766
But her demands started escalating.

374
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:00,866
And recently, she would constantly bug me to get her

375
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:04,066
expensive things such as sea urchins, salmon roe, etc.

376
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:06,166
I couldn't take it anymore!

377
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,466
And when I told her I was quitting the job...

378
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:13,066
If you quit, I'm going to report everything you did till now.

379
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:16,666
If I do that, you'll be jailed for theft.

380
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,966
But you're the one who told me to do it.

381
00:21:18,966 --> 00:21:20,466
Well...

382
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:25,566
Just where do you have proof that I told you to it?

383
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:27,766
You're the only one who'll be arrested.

384
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:31,166
Well, you probably can't become a Japanese cook either,

385
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,666
so maybe it's not all that bad, is it?

386
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:34,766
I just couldn't give up my dream

387
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:36,866
of becoming a cook of Japanese cuisine.

388
00:21:36,866 --> 00:21:38,166
That's why!

389
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,466
But you used the knife that is supposed to be

390
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,066
the life of a cook of Japanese cuisine

391
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:45,266
to commit murder.

392
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:47,266
I don't think you're qualified

393
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:50,666
to be a cook of Japanese cuisine anymore, are you?

394
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:58,366
"Satsuki"

395
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,066
Huh?

396
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,466
Come to think of it,

397
00:23:27,466 --> 00:23:30,166
didn't Dad say he won by a long shot?

398
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:33,666
Huh? These horse racing tickets are all 100 yen.

399
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,566
Even if I won by a long shot,

400
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:39,466
it's not much being that the tickets are all 100 yen.

401
00:23:39,466 --> 00:23:41,066
And yet, I showed off and treated everybody,

402
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:43,066
now it's going to take me a long time to earn what I spent.

403
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:45,166
-What? -Forgive me!

404
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:48,966
-I won't forgive you! Wait up! -Pretty please!

405
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,366
I don't think it'll take too long to get him.
