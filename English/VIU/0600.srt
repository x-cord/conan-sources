00:00:01,164 --> 00:00:03,864
Dear Mr. Kogoro Mouri,

2
00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:05,164
I respect you as a famed detective

3
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:07,764
and would like to ask you something.

4
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:11,764
11 years ago, I was indicted for murder.

5
00:00:11,764 --> 00:00:13,764
Please prove my innocence

6
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:17,064
and clear my name for me with your great deduction.

7
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:20,764
I will talk the details over with you on December 19th,

8
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:22,264
at Kora Inn in Kuchibashi Village,

9
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:25,964
Gunma prefecture, near the site the murder.

10
00:00:25,964 --> 00:00:28,164
Mika Tatezato.

11
00:00:28,164 --> 00:00:32,764
I mean, is that person trying to meet with you, dad,

12
00:00:32,764 --> 00:00:34,964
while that person is still on the run as a murderer?

13
00:00:34,964 --> 00:00:37,464
Yeah. It could be.

14
00:00:37,464 --> 00:00:39,564
It could be?

15
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:41,564
Is it really going to be alright for you to see her?

16
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:45,164
Right! Let's contact the police first.

17
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:46,564
I thought so too.

18
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:49,464
So I had Yamamura of Gunma prefectural police check for me,

19
00:00:49,464 --> 00:00:54,764
but was told that no murder committed near that inn 11 years ago.

20
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:58,464
There seems to be no fugitive by the name Mika Tatezato either.

21
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:05,664
Yamamura said he thinks it's a bad prank.

22
00:01:05,664 --> 00:01:07,664
Then why'd you come?

23
00:01:07,664 --> 00:01:10,064
I had no other choice, did I?

24
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:12,664
Since I ate using the cash that was in the envelope

25
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:14,564
together with the letter.

26
00:01:14,564 --> 00:01:16,864
You use it to eat...

27
00:01:16,864 --> 00:01:19,564
Don't tell me, you mean yesterday's Chinese cuisine?

28
00:01:19,564 --> 00:01:20,964
Come to think of it,

29
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:25,664
Pops was ordering a whole lot of expensive food and drinks.

30
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:26,764
Well...

31
00:01:26,764 --> 00:01:30,064
I'm just going to go check if it's really a prank or not!

32
00:01:50,564 --> 00:01:52,464
Brooding over passing seasons

33
00:01:52,464 --> 00:01:54,264
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

34
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:56,164
Today's the 600th time that we've been aired on TV.

35
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:58,464
The green legend, curse of the water sprite?

36
00:01:58,464 --> 00:02:00,064
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,864
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:04,064
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

39
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:33,017
"The Water Sprite's Dream (Part 1)"

40
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:49,038
You idiot!

41
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:52,238
-Watch out! -I'm sorry!

42
00:03:52,238 --> 00:03:55,138
Are you people by chance going to the Kora Inn?

43
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:58,338
Yes! That's right.

44
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,338
If so, could you give me a lift?

45
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:02,938
I've got reservations at that inn too today.

46
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:06,938
Yeah, I don't mind.

47
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:08,938
Thank you very much.

48
00:04:12,738 --> 00:04:15,238
Well, you're a life-saver!

49
00:04:15,238 --> 00:04:18,038
I thought of walking from the station,

50
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:20,038
but I ran out of breath part way.

51
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:22,638
Could you by chance be Mr. Tatezato?

52
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:27,338
"Rokuro Tokubi (42)" -No. My name is Rokuro Tokubi.

53
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:36,438
But, I think it's pretty far from the station.

54
00:04:36,438 --> 00:04:41,538
Yes. I used to be an elementary school teacher near here before,

55
00:04:41,538 --> 00:04:45,438
and used to like to walk around here looking at the scenery.

56
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:48,938
But, I don't seem to be able to walk like I did before.

57
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:51,738
Well, but that school is closed now

58
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:53,438
and I quit my job as a teacher.

59
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:55,638
Now, I'm an unknown artist.

60
00:04:55,638 --> 00:04:56,638
That's right!

61
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:58,538
Since I've already got you to give me a lift,

62
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:02,138
could I ask you to stop over at a grave site?

63
00:05:02,138 --> 00:05:04,638
What? Grave site?

64
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:08,838
I see...

65
00:05:08,838 --> 00:05:11,938
A child got drifted away and drowned?

66
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:12,938
Yes.

67
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:16,638
The boy who died was named Tatsuhiko Numayama,

68
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:20,238
and he seems to have drifted all the way to the reservoir downstream.

69
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:22,438
Does that have something to do with a murder

70
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:25,138
that was committed 11 years ago?

71
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:27,838
It wasn't murder, it was an accident!

72
00:05:27,838 --> 00:05:30,938
He seems to have been playing at the river despite heavy rainfall

73
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:32,838
and seems to have been taken away by the current.

74
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:35,838
But, I think that was about 10 years ago.

75
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,838
Mr. Tokubi.

76
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:43,438
It's you, Araiwa, right?

77
00:05:43,438 --> 00:05:46,138
Did you come to pay homage to the grave too?

78
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,138
Yes.

79
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:51,038
"Kazuki Araiwa (21)" -Today is Tatsuhiko's memorial day.

80
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,438
But, this sure is a shabby tombstone.

81
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,638
No, the real tomb is elsewhere.

82
00:05:57,638 --> 00:06:00,838
This is a tombstone that the classmates

83
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:03,638
made for Tatsuhiko when he passed away.

84
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:07,938
In place of his bones, we buried things in memory of him.

85
00:06:07,938 --> 00:06:12,238
Of course, I went to pay homage to his real grave too.

86
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,538
But, why here?

87
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:21,138
Because he died taken away by the current of this river in back.

88
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:23,838
On this day, 11 years ago.

89
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:27,038
11... 11 years ago?

90
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,738
This have to do with the murder written in the letter, after all?

91
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:32,438
Letter?

92
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:35,738
How did you know that he was taken by the current of this river?

93
00:06:35,738 --> 00:06:39,838
He was found in the reservoir downstream, right?

94
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:41,938
His shoe was found.

95
00:06:41,938 --> 00:06:44,338
Tatsuhiko's shoe that was stuck between the rocks

96
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:46,338
at the bottom of the river.

97
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:50,338
So, the police concluded that Tatsuhiko,

98
00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:52,738
who was playing at the river, got his foot stuck.

99
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:54,438
In the meantime, it began to rain harder

100
00:06:54,438 --> 00:06:59,538
and he was carried away in a flash flood.

101
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:03,538
But to play at the river in December...

102
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:08,438
I wonder about where in the river that shoe was found.

103
00:07:08,438 --> 00:07:11,838
Over there, where the rock is sticking out.

104
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:13,838
Just about here I think it was.

105
00:07:13,838 --> 00:07:16,838
Is that shoe in some place right now?

106
00:07:16,838 --> 00:07:19,238
About that, we buried it in the grave.

107
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,738
I think you can take a look at it if you dig it out.

108
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:28,538
-Hey! -No!

109
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:29,738
We're fine!

110
00:07:29,738 --> 00:07:31,538
Because it's shallow.

111
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,838
My painting tools somehow made it okay,

112
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:41,538
but I can't use this sketchbook anymore.

113
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:46,038
These incense are useless too.

114
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:49,138
As for me, my bag is made of vinyl

115
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:51,738
so almost nothing got wet.

116
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,438
The cap of my PET bottle was closed tightly,

117
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:56,338
and my change of clothes and pillow are also fine.

118
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:58,038
Hey!

119
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:00,438
Just what're you guys doing?

120
00:08:02,738 --> 00:08:06,438
You guys look familiar?

121
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:08,738
I'm Tatsuhiko's friend

122
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,038
and I came to pay homage to his grave.

123
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:12,838
Pay homage to his grave?

124
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:15,238
What the heck's this grave worth?

125
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:21,038
"Banzo Numayama (51)" -Listen! My son died 11 years ago!

126
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,138
Forget it already!

127
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,238
Son?

128
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:32,138
So, he's the late Tatsuhiko's father.

129
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:35,238
Yes. He's the owner of the inn

130
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:36,938
that we're headed for as well.

131
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:38,038
-What? -What?

132
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:42,138
But, why was the owner of the inn in a place like that?

133
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:44,738
I think he was on guard watching.

134
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:47,338
-What? -On guard watching?

135
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:50,438
That inn is on a highland.

136
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:52,438
And it seems if you use binoculars

137
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:56,638
and look out the small window of the attic, you get a panoramic view.

138
00:08:56,638 --> 00:08:59,438
"Kora Inn" -What? She's not here?

139
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:03,638
Are you sure that a person named Mika Tatezato is not staying here?

140
00:09:03,638 --> 00:09:07,338
I'm supposed to meet that person here early tomorrow morning.

141
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,338
There's no such person...

142
00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:13,538
How about about a murder case that occurred 11 years ago?

143
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:15,738
-I've no idea... -You've no idea?

144
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:18,638
There was.

145
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:20,338
"Bosuke Nohira (45)" -But the story is

146
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:23,738
that the culprit is a water sprite, though.

147
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:25,738
Water sprite?

148
00:09:25,738 --> 00:09:28,338
Yes.

149
00:09:28,338 --> 00:09:32,138
In this area, deep-rooted legends of the water sprite remain.

150
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:34,738
About 12 to 13 years ago,

151
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:37,938
people saying they saw water sprites appeared,

152
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:41,838
TV crews and magazine reporters came here for the scoop.

153
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:44,638
Immediately afterwards, a kid drowned in the river.

154
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:48,038
And people began clamouring that it was the work of a water sprite.

155
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:51,938
But after that, there were no more eye-witness reports of water sprites

156
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:55,638
and virtually no one comes to this shabby place anymore.

157
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:58,438
Wait!

158
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:02,038
The name on this letter Mika Tatezato.

159
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:03,738
If you split the kanji characters "tate", "zato",

160
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:07,738
"mi", "ka" and rearrange them...

161
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:09,338
"Water Sprite"

162
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:12,938
Wouldn't it form the kanji character for "water sprite"?

163
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:14,738
I'm sure that's what it is!

164
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:17,338
The water sprite called dad,

165
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:19,938
the detective here to prove its innocence and clear its name!

166
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:21,938
Everyone is being thrown

167
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:24,938
into panic by senseless superstition!

168
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:28,538
If you insist on continuing to talk about non-existent ghosts,

169
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:30,838
I'm kicking you out of this inn!

170
00:10:33,538 --> 00:10:35,738
Are you really sure?

171
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:38,438
That you dropped your cell phone near that river.

172
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,738
When we were at the river I got mail from Sonoko

173
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:42,938
and I was texting her back.

174
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:45,438
That's when the two men fell into the river,

175
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:48,338
I probably dropped it then...

176
00:10:48,338 --> 00:10:51,238
Couldn't we do this tomorrow?

177
00:10:51,238 --> 00:10:54,338
I thought so too, but Conan...

178
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:55,838
If the battery of the cell phone dies,

179
00:10:55,838 --> 00:10:58,738
we won't be able to hear the ring tone

180
00:10:58,738 --> 00:11:01,338
and won't be able to locate it, right?

181
00:11:03,638 --> 00:11:06,338
I think it was around here.

182
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:08,338
Let's split up and look for it!

183
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:13,738
-Hey! Are you calling? -Yep!

184
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:21,238
I found it!

185
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:30,938
What? What's that noise?

186
00:11:40,238 --> 00:11:41,838
Hey, what's wrong?

187
00:11:41,838 --> 00:11:44,338
Water sprite!

188
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:46,338
What? Water sprite?

189
00:11:49,238 --> 00:11:52,238
There's no such thing around!

190
00:11:52,238 --> 00:11:54,138
I saw one a while ago!

191
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:57,838
It stood up in the river and looked this way.

192
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:03,438
You found your cell phone!

193
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:04,838
Yes.

194
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:10,838
It's started raining!

195
00:12:10,838 --> 00:12:12,138
Let's go back.

196
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:14,038
I guess so.

197
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,538
"Kora Inn"

198
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:23,738
What? You saw the water sprite?

199
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:28,338
Yes. My daughter says that it was there at that river last night.

200
00:12:28,338 --> 00:12:32,338
Well, I think she mistook a branch or something for it though.

201
00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:35,538
I tell you it was really there!

202
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:39,638
Maybe that was a ghost...

203
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:40,638
Ghost?

204
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:44,238
I think you should cut out the talk about the water sprite.

205
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:47,638
Otherwise, that man's going to come shouting again.

206
00:12:49,338 --> 00:12:50,838
Here he comes!

207
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,738
Bad news!

208
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:55,438
The owner...

209
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:56,438
-What? -What?

210
00:12:57,538 --> 00:13:02,138
The dead body was lying on the floor of the dimly lit attic.

211
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:04,938
As if possessed by the water sprite,

212
00:13:04,938 --> 00:13:07,938
and dragged to the bottom of the reservoir,

213
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:11,738
covered in a rancid liquid that stung our noses.

214
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:15,738
Clenching his deceased son's belongings to his chest.

215
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:24,114
"Kora Inn" -What?

216
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:25,514
Drowned to death?

217
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:29,014
Yes, that's what the coroner said.

218
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:31,214
And that judging from the water that was on the victim

219
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:33,314
as well as the type of water that was found in his body,

220
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:36,814
he says that somebody must've drowned him

221
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:40,614
in a contaminated swamp or something somewhere,

222
00:13:40,614 --> 00:13:43,114
and later brought over here!

223
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,814
Come to think of it, he did smell of stench.

224
00:13:45,814 --> 00:13:47,614
-Yeah. -But,

225
00:13:47,614 --> 00:13:51,214
it seems as if the culprit brought that smelly water over here, though.

226
00:13:51,214 --> 00:13:53,214
-What? -What?

227
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:56,014
See! This water dipper...

228
00:13:56,014 --> 00:13:58,014
Smells the same!

229
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:00,814
I see.

230
00:14:00,814 --> 00:14:02,714
The culprit scooped smelling water

231
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:05,114
and poured into this water dipper,

232
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:09,714
then, he sunk Mr. Numayama's face in it and drowned him.

233
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:12,814
Then, in the end the culprit poured that water over the dead body.

234
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:16,014
But, I wonder why Mr. Numayama was in a place like this?

235
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:18,614
It seems to have been a daily routine for him.

236
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:21,714
The clerk of the inn said that every morning after getting up,

237
00:14:21,714 --> 00:14:27,214
he would come here and guard the river from the window,

238
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:29,514
with those binoculars.

239
00:14:29,514 --> 00:14:31,614
But, for what?

240
00:14:31,614 --> 00:14:34,914
I think it's because his son was carried away

241
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:38,114
by the current of that river and died.

242
00:14:38,114 --> 00:14:41,614
So, he didn't want the same thing that happened again,

243
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,514
so he kept watch over from here.

244
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:46,914
Let's see...

245
00:14:46,914 --> 00:14:50,114
It's true, it's in view!

246
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:54,014
But, if he was thinking of his son,

247
00:14:54,014 --> 00:14:57,814
he didn't have to kick the tombstone that his friends made for him.

248
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,914
I hear it's not the 1st or 2nd time he's done that.

249
00:15:00,914 --> 00:15:04,014
Maybe there's something.

250
00:15:04,014 --> 00:15:06,414
Near that river.

251
00:15:06,414 --> 00:15:09,114
It seems that he used to walk around that area

252
00:15:09,114 --> 00:15:12,314
after everybody hit the sack.

253
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:17,014
But the only thing there is the tombstone his friends made.

254
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:21,014
By the way, the shoe that is near the dead body

255
00:15:21,014 --> 00:15:23,514
is Tatsuhiko's shoe, right?

256
00:15:23,514 --> 00:15:26,714
But, I thought you said it was buried under his tombstone?

257
00:15:26,714 --> 00:15:27,814
Yeah.

258
00:15:27,814 --> 00:15:30,514
Then, I wonder if the culprit dug it back up?

259
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:33,214
No, the shoe that was buried was only the right shoe

260
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:35,614
that was stuck between the rocks at the bottom of the river.

261
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:38,514
That looks like the left shoe, though.

262
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:40,314
Then maybe it's the shoe that Tatsuhiko was wearing

263
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,614
when he was carried away by the river

264
00:15:42,614 --> 00:15:46,714
and found at the reservoir?

265
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:48,114
So one side of his shoe came off,

266
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,014
but he was found wearing the other side.

267
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:52,814
No, it seems that the only thing he was wearing

268
00:15:52,814 --> 00:15:55,514
when he was found was his swimming trunks!

269
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:57,614
Only his swimming trunks?

270
00:15:57,614 --> 00:15:59,714
You mean in this cold?

271
00:15:59,714 --> 00:16:03,314
So, maybe he was trying to cold-weather swimming or something.

272
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:05,914
I get it! It's that reservoir!

273
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:09,314
The stink water that was poured over Mr. Numayama,

274
00:16:09,314 --> 00:16:11,714
smelled the same as the water of the reservoir

275
00:16:11,714 --> 00:16:13,714
that Tatsuhiko's dead body was found floating in!

276
00:16:13,714 --> 00:16:18,214
That reservoir turned into an illegal trash dumping site.

277
00:16:18,214 --> 00:16:21,114
From the stench and eerie sight of it,

278
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:24,814
it seems that the villagers named it...

279
00:16:24,814 --> 00:16:26,714
The habitat of the water sprite,

280
00:16:26,714 --> 00:16:29,914
Hell Swamp!

281
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:32,114
Hell... Hell Swamp?

282
00:16:32,114 --> 00:16:35,614
Then... Then, this case has something to do

283
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:39,614
with the water sprite after all?

284
00:16:39,614 --> 00:16:42,314
You know what, Ran.

285
00:16:42,314 --> 00:16:45,814
In this day and age when people are talking of traveling to space,

286
00:16:45,814 --> 00:16:49,114
no such things as water sprites exist!

287
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:52,514
But... last night I...

288
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:57,814
And? Where is that reservoir?

289
00:16:57,814 --> 00:17:01,214
About 10 kilometers downstream from here.

290
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:03,414
Then let's have the forensics go over there,

291
00:17:03,414 --> 00:17:05,114
and compare the water in the reservoir

292
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:08,314
and the water that was on the dead body!

293
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:12,414
I think you should also check everybody's belongings.

294
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:15,514
Because if the culprit out that smelly water

295
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:18,114
into this dipper and enters the inn, it'll be conspicuous,

296
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:20,314
and the smell would catch everyone's attention.

297
00:17:20,314 --> 00:17:23,714
I see. In order to bring that water here,

298
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:27,914
it'd have to put it in an airtight container.

299
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:31,914
Moreover, the stairs that lead to the attic

300
00:17:31,914 --> 00:17:33,814
is behind the restroom.

301
00:17:33,814 --> 00:17:35,814
Pretending to go to the restroom,

302
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:39,614
anyone can enter with ease.

303
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:43,514
In other words, anybody at this inn,

304
00:17:43,514 --> 00:17:46,114
as long as he gets to bring the smelly water here,

305
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:48,014
could've committed the murder.

306
00:17:48,014 --> 00:17:49,014
Yamamura!

307
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:51,314
What's the estimated time of death of the victim?

308
00:17:51,314 --> 00:17:52,714
Yes, sir!

309
00:17:54,014 --> 00:17:57,814
I hear it was between 6:00 to 7:00 this morning!

310
00:17:57,814 --> 00:18:02,514
Okay! Check the alibis of everyone at the inn!

311
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,914
I'll go to the rooms of those spending the night here

312
00:18:04,914 --> 00:18:08,014
and check if there are any suspicious containers!

313
00:18:08,014 --> 00:18:10,814
Yes, sir!

314
00:18:10,814 --> 00:18:14,414
I think that's supposed to be my job.

315
00:18:14,414 --> 00:18:17,714
I mean I wasn't promoted to inspector for nothing, you know.

316
00:18:17,714 --> 00:18:18,814
"Chrysanthemum room"

317
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:22,614
The only airtight containers

318
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:24,314
that I could keep water in are these.

319
00:18:24,314 --> 00:18:27,414
The big bottle for color ink holds 60 ml.

320
00:18:27,414 --> 00:18:30,614
The small bottle holds 15 ml.

321
00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:33,914
But both bottles are quite filled to the top with ink.

322
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:35,514
Even the white container,

323
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,714
is filled more than half way with paint,

324
00:18:37,714 --> 00:18:40,614
so the only empty bottle would be this water container.

325
00:18:42,014 --> 00:18:44,014
100 ml.

326
00:18:44,014 --> 00:18:47,514
Isn't enough to drown a person.

327
00:18:47,514 --> 00:18:49,214
I think so too.

328
00:18:49,214 --> 00:18:52,814
Maybe you have other containers hidden somewhere?

329
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:54,714
I don't think so!

330
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:56,314
Yesterday after he fell into the river,

331
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:59,714
he spread out his belongings and checked them,

332
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:02,114
but didn't have any containers other than these.

333
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:06,214
But why do you have so many tools for painting with you?

334
00:19:06,214 --> 00:19:09,514
-He's an artist. -Really?

335
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:11,614
He seems to previously have been a teacher

336
00:19:11,614 --> 00:19:14,514
at the elementary school that Tatsuhiko went to, though.

337
00:19:14,514 --> 00:19:16,814
That's why I decided to spend the night here,

338
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:19,414
since I came to offer incense to Tatsuhiko's Buddhist altar.

339
00:19:19,414 --> 00:19:20,514
And?

340
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:23,214
At the time of the crime this morning between 6:00 and 7:00

341
00:19:23,214 --> 00:19:24,814
where were you and what were you doing?

342
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:26,914
I was asleep in my room.

343
00:19:26,914 --> 00:19:29,614
Until a person of this inn came

344
00:19:29,614 --> 00:19:31,514
to tell me that breakfast was ready.

345
00:19:33,614 --> 00:19:34,614
"Cherry Blossom room"

346
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:37,714
Then, you also came to offer incense to Tatsuhiko's altar?

347
00:19:37,714 --> 00:19:41,414
Yes, sir! I used to come with everybody else in the past

348
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,214
but, now, only I do.

349
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:46,914
Then, where and what were you doing

350
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:48,314
between 6:00 and 7:00 this morning?

351
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:52,014
I got up at 6:30 am and was taking a bath.

352
00:19:52,014 --> 00:19:54,214
I was all alone, though.

353
00:19:55,814 --> 00:19:57,114
The containers that you can put water inside

354
00:19:57,114 --> 00:20:01,214
are these two 500 ml bottles,

355
00:20:01,214 --> 00:20:03,314
but one is still unopened

356
00:20:03,314 --> 00:20:07,214
and the other one is still more than half filled.

357
00:20:08,814 --> 00:20:11,114
What's this?

358
00:20:11,114 --> 00:20:13,314
That's a water pillow.

359
00:20:13,314 --> 00:20:17,214
You put water inside it and inflate it.

360
00:20:17,214 --> 00:20:19,914
I can't sleep with any other pillow.

361
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:22,714
I get it! A water pillow!

362
00:20:22,714 --> 00:20:25,114
You filled this up with the smelly water

363
00:20:25,114 --> 00:20:27,314
from the reservoir and brought it here!

364
00:20:27,314 --> 00:20:31,614
As proof of that there's no water in here now!

365
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:35,714
I drained the water out when I went to take a bath because I'm leaving.

366
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:39,014
I think he's telling the truth.

367
00:20:39,014 --> 00:20:40,914
Because he too, after falling into the river,

368
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:45,814
he spread his belongings out, but that pillow was deflated flat.

369
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:50,514
But, he could've secretly gone to get the water, right?

370
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:53,514
Well, I guess he could.

371
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,414
"Plum room" -A camera, a camera stand,

372
00:20:57,414 --> 00:21:00,214
an IC recorder, and a laptop computer.

373
00:21:00,214 --> 00:21:01,814
Who are you?

374
00:21:01,814 --> 00:21:03,714
A journalist!

375
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:07,514
I pursue ghostly legends that exist in various districts.

376
00:21:07,514 --> 00:21:11,214
So, you came here because you heard about the water sprite?

377
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:15,114
Yes, I wasn't able to gather much material though.

378
00:21:15,114 --> 00:21:18,014
But, how unusual.

379
00:21:18,014 --> 00:21:19,514
That you're carrying around a camera

380
00:21:19,514 --> 00:21:21,414
that uses film instead of a digital camera.

381
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:24,314
I used to be a cameraman before, that's why.

382
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:27,314
I just can't come to like digital cameras.

383
00:21:27,314 --> 00:21:30,114
Well, with this many film cases

384
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:32,114
I guess you could fill quite an amount of

385
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:34,014
the water in question.

386
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:36,414
Hey! Didn't I tell you a while ago

387
00:21:36,414 --> 00:21:39,214
that I was talking to the editor in charge all the way

388
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,014
from 6:00 am in the morning till a little past 7:00 am!

389
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:43,514
Isn't that quite too long?

390
00:21:43,514 --> 00:21:46,714
Talking for more than an hour from that early in the morning?

391
00:21:46,714 --> 00:21:48,914
I was discussing the matter

392
00:21:48,914 --> 00:21:50,714
because I couldn't gather stories on the water sprite!

393
00:21:50,714 --> 00:21:54,014
The printing deadline is near and my camera broke too.

394
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:56,714
What? Your camera broke?

395
00:21:56,714 --> 00:21:58,614
It got soaked in the rain!

396
00:21:58,614 --> 00:22:02,014
It suddenly raining last night when I was taking pictures outside.

397
00:22:05,314 --> 00:22:08,214
On top of that, you caught a cold?

398
00:22:08,214 --> 00:22:11,714
Yeah. I had a slight cold to begin with,

399
00:22:11,714 --> 00:22:14,014
but it got worse.

400
00:22:17,414 --> 00:22:21,214
The foul smelling water that drowned Mr. Banzo Numayama.

401
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,114
If it was the water from the reservoir

402
00:22:24,114 --> 00:22:26,814
where Tatsuhiko's body was found,

403
00:22:26,814 --> 00:22:28,014
it can be assumed that

404
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:32,514
this incident occurred because of Tatsuhiko's death.

405
00:22:32,514 --> 00:22:34,914
What on earth is the culprit's purpose for wanting to make it look

406
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:37,614
as if it were the curse of the water sprite?

407
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:01,714
A water sprite again?

408
00:24:01,714 --> 00:24:04,114
It is! It's really true!

409
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,414
This is indeed...

410
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,814
An alien!

411
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:13,414
I see.

412
00:24:13,414 --> 00:24:16,314
So it was tightly put into smaller containers.

413
00:24:16,314 --> 00:24:20,214
I shall disclose the truth of the case to you!

414
00:24:20,214 --> 00:24:24,114
Over the name of the inspector of the Gunma Prefectural Police!

415
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:25,614
Next Conan,

416
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:29,714
"The Water Sprite's Dream (Part 2)"

417
00:24:45,014 --> 00:24:47,214
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:47,214 --> 00:24:49,514
"The color green"

419
00:24:49,514 --> 00:24:50,914
I swear I saw a water sprite!

420
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:52,314
I understand, water spout...

421
00:24:52,314 --> 00:24:54,714
-You're not taking me seriously, are you? -No. I'm not.
