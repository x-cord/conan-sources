1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:00,992
"Yotsubishi Bank."

2
00:00:01,031 --> 00:00:05,605
A fake bomb threat made to a bank caused a panic.

3
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:11,305
Genta, Sumito Kagura, and others were injured as collateral damage.

4
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:15,205
According to his friends, Go Kochiyama and Haruka Ibe,

5
00:00:15,206 --> 00:00:19,206
Kagura also suffered collateral damage half a month earlier.

6
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:26,305
It's hard to believe two incidents in half a month is a coincidence.

7
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:27,605
After getting a taste for the compensation he received

8
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:30,105
after the first incident,

9
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:32,305
perhaps he caused the panic himself

10
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:35,505
in order to receive more money.

11
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:37,405
We suspected Kagura

12
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:39,905
and even discovered testimony backing it up.

13
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,106
But just as we were setting out to find conclusive evidence...

14
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:49,106
Kikuhide Otsubo, another one of the victims, was murdered.

15
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:55,405
It's possible Edogawa is right,

16
00:00:55,406 --> 00:00:59,205
and Otsubo learned a grave secret about yesterday's incident

17
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:02,105
and was killed for it.

18
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:04,705
What? Wouldn't that mean

19
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:07,905
that Otsubo was killed by Kagura?

20
00:01:07,906 --> 00:01:09,905
-Huh? -What?

21
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:12,006
It makes sense, but...

22
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,605
There's something...

23
00:01:15,606 --> 00:01:18,205
You guys keep talking about evidence,

24
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:22,205
but even without it, I'll put the screws on him until he confesses!

25
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:24,006
-Genta! -Hey!

26
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:26,805
What should we do, Conan?

27
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:28,705
That might work.

28
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:29,706
What?

29
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:31,605
We won't give him a hard time,

30
00:01:31,606 --> 00:01:36,105
but we might be able to pick something up by going directly to Kagura.

31
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:39,505
He might reveal something about himself.

32
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:43,506
Yeah. Let's go talk to Kagura.

33
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,705
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

34
00:01:48,706 --> 00:01:50,705
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

35
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:52,405
Adults with impure motives!

36
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:54,305
What are their unseen true intentions?

37
00:01:54,306 --> 00:01:55,905
He sees through the one and only truth.

38
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:57,805
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

39
00:01:57,806 --> 00:02:00,106
His name is Detective Conan!

40
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:47,109
"The Cost of Likes (Part 2)"

41
00:03:53,418 --> 00:03:54,817
"Sumito Kagura (26)" -You're already here?

42
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,017
On the phone you said this afternoon.

43
00:03:57,018 --> 00:04:00,617
Oh, it's you kids.

44
00:04:00,618 --> 00:04:02,017
We need to talk.

45
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:03,417
What?

46
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:06,817
I don't know what it's about, but we can talk on the way.

47
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:10,117
My payday was yesterday,

48
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:13,018
but I never withdrew the money because of the commotion.

49
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:18,517
Murdered?

50
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:20,117
Otsubo was?

51
00:04:20,118 --> 00:04:22,318
You already know all about that, don't you?

52
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:25,318
Why would I?

53
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,817
By the way, Kagura,

54
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:30,517
didn't you previously tell your acting company

55
00:04:30,518 --> 00:04:34,717
that you hoped to suffer collateral damage again

56
00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:36,417
so you'd receive more money?

57
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:39,117
-Who said that? -You did!

58
00:04:39,118 --> 00:04:43,717
I've never said anything that audacious.

59
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:44,718
Hey!

60
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:45,918
Wait.

61
00:04:47,618 --> 00:04:50,117
That felt a little strange.

62
00:04:50,118 --> 00:04:53,317
He doesn't seem to be lying.

63
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:54,617
Don't let him fool you!

64
00:04:54,618 --> 00:04:56,918
He's an actor!

65
00:04:58,418 --> 00:05:03,717
You're sure he said "some more tasty collateral damage", right?

66
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:04,917
You're doubting us?

67
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:07,017
And our detective skills?

68
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:09,217
"Chonenten."

69
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:12,517
Kagura clearly said it, right?

70
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:15,017
"Chiichiro Dewa (30)" -Yeah. That's what I heard.

71
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:16,717
You heard?

72
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:21,017
You didn't hear it directly from Kagura?

73
00:05:21,018 --> 00:05:24,117
Oh, not directly.

74
00:05:24,118 --> 00:05:26,517
I heard it from him.

75
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:28,817
Didn't Kagura say

76
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:32,817
he hoped to suffer more collateral damage so he'd get paid again?

77
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:35,417
Yeah, apparently.

78
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,017
Apparently?

79
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:38,617
So apparently, you heard it, too.

80
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:41,317
It's all starting to sound suspicious.

81
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:43,917
Then who told you?

82
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:45,417
Kochiyama.

83
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:46,818
Not that you'd know him.

84
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:50,317
That Kochiyama?

85
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:52,617
Hey.

86
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,217
We saw her yesterday, too.

87
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:56,117
She's a witness!

88
00:05:56,118 --> 00:05:57,817
Didn't you say yesterday

89
00:05:57,818 --> 00:06:01,617
that Kagura hoped to suffer more collateral damage?

90
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:05,017
That's what I heard from Kochiyama.

91
00:06:05,018 --> 00:06:06,217
-Wait. -Wait.

92
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:08,017
Her, too?

93
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:11,817
It sounds like Kochiyama is the source of everything.

94
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:15,017
Kochiyama is Kagura's friend, right?

95
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:17,117
Do you guys know him, too?

96
00:06:17,118 --> 00:06:19,617
We acted together in college.

97
00:06:19,618 --> 00:06:21,917
He started working after graduation,

98
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,217
but we still hang out.

99
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,018
He even comes here sometimes.

100
00:06:28,018 --> 00:06:30,517
So he's a former actor, too.

101
00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:32,417
Oh, right. That might've been a lie.

102
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:33,917
A lie?

103
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,917
Kochiyama might've spread the rumor on purpose.

104
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:40,717
If Haruka thought Kagura were good for nothing,

105
00:06:40,718 --> 00:06:43,817
she might go to him instead.

106
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:45,117
It's possible.

107
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:46,118
Yeah.

108
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:48,517
I wouldn't put it past him.

109
00:06:48,518 --> 00:06:50,117
What does that mean?

110
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,717
Isn't that the lady who was with them yesterday?

111
00:06:53,718 --> 00:06:57,018
So they're not just three best friends after all.

112
00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:02,717
In any case,

113
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:05,317
we'll know if Kagura actually said that or not

114
00:07:05,318 --> 00:07:08,617
if we ask Kochiyama.

115
00:07:08,618 --> 00:07:14,017
Yes, but even if he did, that's not conclusive.

116
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:17,217
What we need is conclusive evidence.

117
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:19,617
What would that be?

118
00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:21,217
Are there any clues?

119
00:07:21,218 --> 00:07:22,518
I knew it.

120
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:26,817
"How can this be a coincidence?" -Isn't that Kochiyama's post?

121
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:31,917
And the murdered Otsubo was following Kagura.

122
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,718
If he was following him, then...

123
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:35,918
Could it be...

124
00:07:37,018 --> 00:07:38,217
What is it?

125
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:40,518
But then why would he...

126
00:07:42,618 --> 00:07:43,618
Conan...

127
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:46,618
Where can we find her?

128
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,117
"Haruka Ibe."

129
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:50,418
This woman.

130
00:07:56,618 --> 00:07:59,518
"Go Kochiyama (26)"

131
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:02,517
A love triangle?

132
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:05,717
Between Kagura, Kochiyama, and me?

133
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,718
"Haruka Ibe (24)"

134
00:08:09,318 --> 00:08:13,017
No, no way. Absolutely not.

135
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:16,417
But the acting company mentioned something about one.

136
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:20,717
I was originally a fan of Kagura the actor.

137
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:26,317
I joined the company a year ago because I wanted to act with him.

138
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:30,318
Kagura introduced me to Kochiyama shortly after that.

139
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:33,517
This is Kochiyama.

140
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:37,117
I've been stuck with this idiot since college.

141
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:39,217
I'm the idiot.

142
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,317
What are you doing?

143
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:43,217
I'm Haruka Ibe.

144
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:45,518
We became close right away.

145
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:47,917
Here it comes, Kagura!

146
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:48,918
Bring it on!

147
00:08:57,118 --> 00:09:00,517
Kagura and Kochiyama were so close.

148
00:09:00,518 --> 00:09:02,217
I was jealous.

149
00:09:02,218 --> 00:09:04,317
He's a tough one! Back me up, Haruka!

150
00:09:04,318 --> 00:09:05,318
Got it!

151
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:10,818
Two on one? That's not fair!

152
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:18,218
I was so happy that they allowed me to join them.

153
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:24,218
There's nothing romantic about our relationship.

154
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:30,217
Sorry. I'd better head back.

155
00:09:30,218 --> 00:09:31,917
Later.

156
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:35,117
Even if she's not aware of it...

157
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:37,517
Right?

158
00:09:37,518 --> 00:09:41,317
Well, we can guess how they feel about her.

159
00:09:41,318 --> 00:09:42,617
But what about it?

160
00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:45,717
What did we come to confirm?

161
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:52,318
What's behind the bomb threat and Otsubo's case.

162
00:09:57,418 --> 00:09:59,817
If you think of that way, it explains everything.

163
00:09:59,818 --> 00:10:02,518
And if I'm right, then...

164
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:05,518
Thank you.

165
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:14,417
We investigated the connection between the bomb threat

166
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:18,117
and Kikuhide Otsubo's murder,

167
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,017
but we haven't found anything yet.

168
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:23,517
You've found clues

169
00:10:23,518 --> 00:10:27,418
to the identity of the culprit who made the bomb threat, right?

170
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:31,917
No, not at all.

171
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:32,918
You haven't?

172
00:10:34,418 --> 00:10:36,817
We heard a cleaning person was spotted

173
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:38,817
at the public phone in question

174
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:43,117
just before and after the call was made to the bank.

175
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:44,617
According to the cleaning company,

176
00:10:44,618 --> 00:10:47,317
no one was working around then,

177
00:10:47,318 --> 00:10:50,217
so that must have been the culprit.

178
00:10:50,218 --> 00:10:54,917
But we don't have any clues to their identity.

179
00:10:54,918 --> 00:10:58,517
Sounds like your reasoning was wrong.

180
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:00,417
-Yeah. -Yeah.

181
00:11:00,418 --> 00:11:02,617
If they didn't leave any clues,

182
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:06,017
then the plan doesn't work.

183
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:07,018
What plan?

184
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:09,817
Inspector.

185
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:10,917
Yes.

186
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:12,118
What?

187
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:18,117
We received an anonymous call.

188
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:19,517
Last night around eight,

189
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:24,517
someone was seen fleeing the scene of Otsubo's murder.

190
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,817
Around the time of the murder?

191
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:26,818
Yeah.

192
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:30,217
Apparently the caller asked if the suspicious figure

193
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:32,817
might've been the unlucky man who's been seen online recently,

194
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,717
but we have no idea who they meant.

195
00:11:35,718 --> 00:11:38,017
They must mean Kagura.

196
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:39,518
I knew it was him.

197
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:42,417
So that's how it is.

198
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:45,017
Their plan's not over yet.

199
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:49,417
If their ultimate goal lies beyond what I thought...

200
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,117
-Could it be... -Yeah.

201
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:55,318
That explains why there weren't any clues left in the public phone.

202
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:58,017
-What do you mean? -What do you mean?

203
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:00,817
Which means we'd better hurry!

204
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:02,217
Come with me!

205
00:12:02,218 --> 00:12:03,817
Hurry!

206
00:12:03,818 --> 00:12:05,117
Us, too!

207
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:06,518
-Let's go! -Yeah!

208
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,497
To bad luck and audacity.

209
00:12:23,498 --> 00:12:26,598
And the nerve to use me for likes again.

210
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,498
Wait!

211
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:35,197
We're the police.

212
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:36,997
We're coming in.

213
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:38,397
You kids?

214
00:12:38,398 --> 00:12:39,997
The police?

215
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:44,097
I don't think you should be drinking while you're injured.

216
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:45,098
Or...

217
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:52,097
Would you care to drink like this instead, Kagura and Kochiyama?

218
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:53,098
What?

219
00:12:57,298 --> 00:13:02,697
It wasn't a coincidence that Kagura suffered collateral damage yesterday.

220
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,797
He was set up by the culprit.

221
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:07,297
Isn't that right,

222
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:08,598
Kochiyama?

223
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:13,197
What do you mean?

224
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:17,197
Yesterday, the 25th, was your payday.

225
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:22,097
You were sure to go to that bank to withdraw the money.

226
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:26,297
And since you're friends, so naturally Kochiyama would knew that.

227
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:28,397
He disguised himself as a cleaning person

228
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:30,697
and waited for you to arrive.

229
00:13:30,698 --> 00:13:34,498
Just when you arrived in front of the bank...

230
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:39,298
Several bombs have been placed around your bank.

231
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:44,997
Why would Kochiyama do that?

232
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:49,597
Kagura, half a month ago, you received monetary compensation

233
00:13:49,598 --> 00:13:52,197
when you were injured by an unexploded bomb, right?

234
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,797
You got a taste for that money,

235
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:57,297
so you caused the panic yourself

236
00:13:57,298 --> 00:13:59,997
and pretended to be a victim in order to receive more money.

237
00:13:59,998 --> 00:14:02,897
That's what he wanted people to think.

238
00:14:02,898 --> 00:14:05,797
I didn't do anything like that.

239
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:09,098
You even dropped hints in advance to his friends.

240
00:14:13,398 --> 00:14:17,097
I heard Kagura say

241
00:14:17,098 --> 00:14:20,397
that he hoped to suffer more tasty collateral damage

242
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:22,897
so he could receive more compensation.

243
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:23,898
Like that.

244
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:26,497
I never said that.

245
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,398
He put another plan in motion yesterday.

246
00:14:30,498 --> 00:14:34,097
He didn't make this post to earn likes,

247
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:37,897
but to frame you as the culprit.

248
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:39,297
Why?

249
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:43,897
Kochiyama's comment posted under the handle Tanuki Ponkichi emphasizes

250
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:46,797
that it's hard to imagine it was a coincidence

251
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:50,497
that you experienced two similar incidents in half a month.

252
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:55,397
That's what made us suspect Kagura did it for the money.

253
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:58,097
We totally fell for it.

254
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,497
Just like he wanted.

255
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:01,697
Not that!

256
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:05,098
I'm asking why Kochiyama would try to frame me!

257
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:10,097
If he just wanted to frame you,

258
00:15:10,098 --> 00:15:14,497
he would've left clues pointing to you.

259
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,597
But there weren't any.

260
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:17,897
None at all.

261
00:15:17,898 --> 00:15:19,697
Why?

262
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:24,097
Because leaving evidence would cause the police to arrest Kagura,

263
00:15:24,098 --> 00:15:27,698
preventing him from reaching his ultimate goal, right?

264
00:15:29,098 --> 00:15:32,198
And you meant to try for that goal last night, didn't you?

265
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,697
Let's have a drink tonight to cleanse you of this evil.

266
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:39,197
You'll be at your apartment, right?

267
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,497
But it didn't go as planned when Kikuhide Otsubo arrived.

268
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:46,797
-Otsubo? -Yeah.

269
00:15:46,798 --> 00:15:51,297
His life's purpose was earning likes on interesting posts.

270
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:53,197
He was secretly following you for potential material

271
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,797
since you're so unlucky.

272
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:58,197
Me?

273
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:01,197
Otsubo also viewed Tanuki Ponkichi as his rival

274
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,297
because he kept making interesting posts.

275
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:07,697
When that man appeared before him,

276
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:10,997
Otsubo decided to follow Kochiyama instead.

277
00:16:10,998 --> 00:16:16,697
He hoped to stumble upon interesting material if he did.

278
00:16:16,698 --> 00:16:20,697
But something made Otsubo realize

279
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:23,197
that you were the one who made the bomb threat.

280
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:24,198
No, I...

281
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:26,897
So you silenced him.

282
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:31,297
Shocked by the murder, you canceled your plans for last night.

283
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:33,397
Today, you anonymously called the police

284
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:36,297
so you could reach your ultimate goal.

285
00:16:36,298 --> 00:16:41,097
It might've been the unlucky man who's been seen online recently.

286
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:46,497
You were vague so the police wouldn't arrive immediately.

287
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:50,397
In other words, this was the story you came up with.

288
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:55,597
I successfully caused a commotion for money,

289
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,397
but Otsubo realized what I'd done,

290
00:16:58,398 --> 00:17:00,697
so I killed him.

291
00:17:00,698 --> 00:17:04,597
It's only a matter of time before I'm caught.

292
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:06,497
You planned to tell the police that's what he said,

293
00:17:06,498 --> 00:17:09,097
and when they responded to your call...

294
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:10,597
I don't understand!

295
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:12,297
I thought Kagura was just drinking a beer,

296
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:16,797
but then he suddenly started choking...

297
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:18,397
You planned to act

298
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:20,998
as if he killed himself out of desperation, didn't you?

299
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:25,297
You were going to kill me and make it look like a suicide?

300
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:26,398
Why?

301
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,798
Probably...

302
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:35,498
because of Haruka Ibe.

303
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,198
She has nothing to do with this!

304
00:17:40,698 --> 00:17:43,898
Based on your reaction, it sounds like he's right.

305
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,298
Haruka? What about her?

306
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,297
Haruka told us

307
00:17:57,298 --> 00:18:00,897
the three of you are very close,

308
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:03,997
but there's nothing romantic about your relationship.

309
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:05,997
That's exactly how it is!

310
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:10,398
But maybe it was different for Kochiyama.

311
00:18:13,598 --> 00:18:16,198
You have feelings for Haruka?

312
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:20,797
While having fun together,

313
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:27,697
Kochiyama secretly desired to make Haruka his own

314
00:18:27,698 --> 00:18:31,598
and for you to disappear.

315
00:18:33,398 --> 00:18:37,597
But the police would investigate if he simply murdered you,

316
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:40,197
so he thought to make it look like suicide.

317
00:18:40,198 --> 00:18:43,297
You needed a motive for that.

318
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:47,997
That's when you suffered collateral damage from the unexploded bomb

319
00:18:47,998 --> 00:18:50,298
and he came up with this plan.

320
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:54,197
Having gotten a taste for the monetary compensation,

321
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:57,397
this time you called a bomb threat into a bank and caused a panic,

322
00:18:57,398 --> 00:19:00,697
but things got out of control, so you took your own life.

323
00:19:00,698 --> 00:19:03,497
He wanted that to be your motive for suicide.

324
00:19:03,498 --> 00:19:07,098
In other words, his plan was already in motion when he took this picture.

325
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:10,998
Half a month ago...

326
00:19:11,998 --> 00:19:16,297
Otsubo probably didn't know about the plan,

327
00:19:16,298 --> 00:19:20,197
but he wanted to frame you for it, too.

328
00:19:20,198 --> 00:19:22,197
He went as far as to kill a person

329
00:19:22,198 --> 00:19:25,697
to strengthen your motive for suicide.

330
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,097
But everything I've said is speculation.

331
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:29,997
There's no evidence.

332
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:34,697
If we find poison in the glass Kagura was meant to drink from,

333
00:19:34,698 --> 00:19:38,597
the police will begin their investigation into this attempted murder.

334
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:41,798
Then everything will become clear.

335
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:52,197
The boy's right.

336
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:56,498
You admit to killing Kikuhide Otsubo?

337
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,698
Apparently he saw me.

338
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:03,997
He saw a cleaning person making a phone call.

339
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:06,698
He didn't think anything of it at the time though.

340
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:10,898
Hey.

341
00:20:11,898 --> 00:20:15,097
Aren't those clothes...

342
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:19,697
Are you the one who made that call?

343
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:21,998
I didn't think anyone was following me!

344
00:20:23,498 --> 00:20:27,097
You caused the commotion so you could post about it.

345
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:32,197
So Tanuki Ponkichi has been using underhanded techniques to earn likes.

346
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:37,197
He was confused about why I called, but...

347
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:39,697
I'll expose everything!

348
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:42,397
If he did that,

349
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:45,697
the plan I'd spent half a month on...

350
00:20:45,698 --> 00:20:47,098
So before he could...

351
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,998
I had to kill him!

352
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,998
Kochiyama?

353
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:15,798
Why are the police arresting you?

354
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:33,598
That idiot.

355
00:23:04,298 --> 00:23:06,697
But they were three best friends.

356
00:23:06,698 --> 00:23:09,598
It just means adults are complicated.

357
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,897
What is it, Genta?

358
00:23:13,898 --> 00:23:16,197
You look so serious.

359
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:19,497
I wonder how much compensation I'll receive.

360
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,897
What?

361
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:23,997
At least enough to buy a hundred broiled eels over rice, right?

362
00:23:23,998 --> 00:23:25,897
The simple-minded are terrifying.

363
00:23:25,898 --> 00:23:28,097
Was he better off not knowing?

364
00:23:28,098 --> 00:23:30,097
Genta, you're the worst!

365
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:32,297
You're the worst!

366
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:33,797
Hey, wait!

367
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:35,997
I'll share with you guys!

368
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,697
That's not what we're talking about!

369
00:23:37,698 --> 00:23:38,698
Don't follow us!

370
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:40,297
I'll throw in some eel liver soup, too!

371
00:23:40,298 --> 00:23:41,697
What's that?

372
00:23:41,698 --> 00:23:42,698
Gross!

373
00:23:43,698 --> 00:23:44,797
"Next Episode"

374
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,897
I killed them.

375
00:23:46,898 --> 00:23:52,597
Why were you suspected of running off with the ring?

376
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:53,997
It's all right.

377
00:23:53,998 --> 00:23:59,398
None of the staff believed you took the ring.

378
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:07,198
A fire? Could it be...

379
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:13,698
