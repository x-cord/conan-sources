1
00:00:09,107 --> 00:00:11,606
"Lost! Nyan (Male). Reward."

2
00:00:11,607 --> 00:00:13,806
Oh, Nyan.

3
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:16,006
You've lost so much weight.

4
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:18,607
-Thank you so much. -No problem.

5
00:00:21,507 --> 00:00:22,806
I tell you.

6
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:27,306
Why does a famed detective like me go around searching for lost cats?

7
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:31,106
Who cares, you got paid a good sum, right?

8
00:00:31,107 --> 00:00:33,006
Well, I guess so.

9
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:36,907
Then, let's go have something good to eat.

10
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:42,207
I see, so that's why you're tagging along.

11
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:46,006
Then since it's already past noon,

12
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:47,806
shall we go to a fast food restaurant?

13
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:50,106
Let's go some place better.

14
00:00:50,107 --> 00:00:52,706
Yeah, when I'm by myself.

15
00:00:52,707 --> 00:00:54,706
-Cheapskate. -Did you say something?

16
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:56,707
Nope, nothing.

17
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:00,906
It seems to have come from downstairs!

18
00:01:00,907 --> 00:01:01,907
Yeah.

19
00:01:09,107 --> 00:01:10,706
Is anything wrong?

20
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:12,806
The room's been ransacked

21
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:14,906
and there's blood on the floor too.

22
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:16,006
Did you go inside?

23
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:18,706
We're too scared to go in.

24
00:01:18,707 --> 00:01:20,106
Got it.

25
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:22,906
Then, you all stay here.

26
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:25,007
I'll go check things out.

27
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:40,806
No good, he's dead.

28
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:43,607
Excuse me, please call the police.

29
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:47,607
What? Where's the other lady?

30
00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:50,607
Saki!

31
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:04,607
-Saki! -Hold it!

32
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:08,807
Saki!

33
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:14,106
Saki!

34
00:02:14,107 --> 00:02:15,806
Open your eyes!

35
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:18,507
Miss, please back away.

36
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,007
No good.

37
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:24,407
No...

38
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:41,906
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

39
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:44,306
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

40
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:46,206
Two victims within the first two minutes.

41
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,406
The trick behind the case defies imagination.

42
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:50,106
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:52,206
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:54,607
His name is Detective Conan!

45
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:29,114
"The Socialite Couple's Secret"

46
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:39,932
I see.

47
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:43,032
You came to the front door, sensed something was wrong

48
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,132
and was about to call the police.

49
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:47,432
Then, he came.

50
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:49,332
Yes, that's right.

51
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:53,632
And then this kid and I went inside to check things out.

52
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:57,833
And we found a man dead in the living room.

53
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:02,532
Then, you found a woman dead in the bedroom,

54
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,632
and reported it to the police.

55
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:07,333
Yes, that's correct.

56
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:13,132
And? Why did you all come here to begin with?

57
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,732
"Yoshie Hayashi (62), Apartment Manager" - Since the two over there

58
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:19,532
said they wanted me to open this room, so I came to open it.

59
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:20,533
See.

60
00:05:20,534 --> 00:05:25,632
I was hired asked to pick up a package.

61
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:29,732
I promised Saki that I would go shopping with her.

62
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:33,232
And I came to get her because she didn't show up.

63
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,632
I see.

64
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:36,032
Inspector Megure.

65
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:39,232
Oh, good work, how is it?

66
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:42,232
All the neighbors are out,

67
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:46,732
and we haven't found any telling evidence.

68
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:52,032
Only valuables such as cash cards, bank books and jewelry are missing.

69
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,732
Judging from the messiness of this room,

70
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:57,732
it's highly likely that the room was broken into.

71
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,432
And has the victim been identified?

72
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:02,032
The man found dead in the living room

73
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:06,132
is Mr. Seiichi Maehara, age 32, a day trader.

74
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:09,232
In other words, he was a stock investor.

75
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,532
It seems that he was stabbed several times in his chest

76
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:13,632
with a sharp object

77
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:16,933
and died of excessive blood loss.

78
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,632
It seems he made a load from stock recently.

79
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:24,432
Tens of millions have been transferred to his bank account.

80
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:27,832
This has already been confirmed with the investment company.

81
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,932
Which means that the perp was after this money?

82
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,432
Most probably so.

83
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:36,133
And what about the woman in the bedroom?

84
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:40,332
She is Seiichi's wife, Mrs. Saki Maehara.

85
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,232
Age 29, a housewife.

86
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:45,632
The cause of her death is suffocation

87
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:47,832
from having her nose and mouth airways blocked.

88
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,232
What is the estimated time of death?

89
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:57,132
Mr. Maehara died around 11am and his wife around 12.30pm.

90
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,233
Inspector Megure.

91
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:04,032
Around 11am, someone who looked to be the perp was seen

92
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:06,732
going in through the entrance of the condo

93
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:08,832
on the security camera.

94
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,332
What?

95
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,633
This is a print out of that image.

96
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:18,832
With all this disguise, it's hard to make out the features.

97
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,832
Does this person look familiar to any of you?

98
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,332
No.

99
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,832
I see.

100
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,732
And, there's one more thing.

101
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:31,432
The security camera by the emergency stairs was broken.

102
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:33,132
The emergency stairs?

103
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,232
Yes.

104
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:38,132
Oh, it was broken two days ago.

105
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:40,532
It's a bad prank.

106
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:41,832
I see.

107
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,632
But, the footage of the person

108
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:47,432
entering and exiting the building is here,

109
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,833
so the damaged camera probably had nothing to do with this case.

110
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:55,232
I guess it'll be safe to say that this person is

111
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,932
somehow involved in the killing of Mr. and Mrs. Maehara.

112
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:02,432
Put out an APB and search for this individual!

113
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:03,433
Yes, sir!

114
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:27,532
There you are.

115
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:28,832
We're going home.

116
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,732
We're going home already?

117
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:33,232
All that's left to do is for the police to find the perp

118
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:35,032
and make the arrest.

119
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:37,032
My job as a detective is finished.

120
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,533
Okay.

121
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:43,732
So, Inspector, we'll be on our way then.

122
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,932
All right, thank you.

123
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:48,632
-Inspector Megure. -What's up?

124
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:51,433
The forensics found this.

125
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,832
This is...

126
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,132
There's blood on it

127
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:02,132
and I guess we could say it was used to commit the crime.

128
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:05,532
Officer Chiba, where was this found?

129
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:08,832
Well, it was in the trash bin of this condo.

130
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:09,833
What?

131
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:18,332
It's a lie! I can't believe something like that.

132
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,933
Well, please calm down.

133
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:25,432
We were contacted by officers that were asking around in that area,

134
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:28,032
and found that Saki had purchased

135
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:33,032
the clothes used in the robbery at a Do-It-Yourself store.

136
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:34,332
No...

137
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,032
It's hard to believe, is it?

138
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,032
Saki would never do something like that!

139
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:42,132
I understand you don't want to believe so,

140
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:45,032
however, from the inside of the knitted cap, some hair was collected

141
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:47,132
and it matched Saki's hair.

142
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,432
In other words, everything was a fake play.

143
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:51,132
It was a premeditated murder

144
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:56,132
that Saki had thought up taking advantage of the security camera.

145
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:59,932
So, now it's apparent why the security camera at the emergency stairs

146
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,432
-was broken too. -Yeah.

147
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,232
Just what do you mean?

148
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:07,432
After she disguised herself as the robber and went outside,

149
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:09,732
she disposed of the evidence in the trash bin.

150
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,232
In order to return to the apartment,

151
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:15,533
she needed to take the back road to avoid the security camera.

152
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:35,332
Then, why did she suffocate to death?

153
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,232
There was nothing odd about it,

154
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,732
so I guess we could conclude that it was an accident that occurred

155
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:43,133
when she tried to pretend that she was a victim.

156
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,532
She tied her own hands and feet,

157
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:50,032
and went inside the closet, but...

158
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:54,432
Because of the large amount of clothes, she was unable to breathe.

159
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:57,032
An unfortunate accident.

160
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,832
Rather the really unfortunate one was probably

161
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,832
the husband who ended up being killed by his wife, though...

162
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,332
Saki... this can't be true.

163
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,233
It's utterly unbelievable.

164
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:12,332
I guess you were all called here by her to become the first people

165
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,732
to discover the crime.

166
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:16,232
Me?

167
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,733
No...

168
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:37,633
Saki!

169
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,932
Saki!

170
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:44,633
Open your eyes!

171
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:49,032
Here again.

172
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:50,732
We're going home, I said.

173
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:54,133
We've missed out on eating lunch completely.

174
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,633
I'm starved!

175
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:04,232
All the expensive suits are going to be wrinkled.

176
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:06,832
No matter how you pretend to be on the surface,

177
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:11,333
people are what they really are in hidden places.

178
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:34,133
Hey, don't go snooping around!

179
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:37,033
Maybe...

180
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:50,618
Inspector Megure!

181
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:54,018
Inspector!

182
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:55,817
According to the report from forensics,

183
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:59,317
they found her fingerprints on the band

184
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:02,017
that was tied onto her corpse.

185
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:04,117
What about other fingerprints?

186
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:06,617
No other prints were found on that band.

187
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:10,917
There were fingerprints of Ms. Maiko Hori on the masking tape though.

188
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:12,317
It probably got there

189
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:15,617
because she tried to peel off the masking tape after finding the body.

190
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:17,217
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:19,617
I was so shocked.

192
00:13:19,618 --> 00:13:24,117
It's obvious that she tied herself.

193
00:13:24,118 --> 00:13:25,417
Oh, no...

194
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:28,917
May I leave already?

195
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:31,818
I still have deliveries to make.

196
00:13:32,518 --> 00:13:35,417
I've got work to do too.

197
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:39,417
Since we've concluded who the perp is, I guess it all right.

198
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,618
Excuse me then...

199
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:47,718
Mr. Mouri?

200
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:51,717
What? What seems to be the matter?

201
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:56,117
Please wait, the case hasn't been solved yet.

202
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:58,017
Just what're you talking about?

203
00:13:58,018 --> 00:14:00,917
-The case has been... -Something's odd.

204
00:14:00,918 --> 00:14:02,917
What is?

205
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:06,117
Although Officer Chiba found the murder weapon

206
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:10,517
that was used in this case in the trash bin of the condo.

207
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:13,617
Would the perp usually dispose of

208
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:15,717
such conclusive evidence

209
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:17,817
in such a place?

210
00:14:17,818 --> 00:14:21,017
Maybe the perp thought it could be retrieved immediately.

211
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:23,117
Today is Saturday.

212
00:14:23,118 --> 00:14:25,717
So the next trash is next week Monday.

213
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:28,917
Which means that the weapon would be left in the trash bin

214
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:30,817
for two days.

215
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:31,918
Yes.

216
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:35,417
I see.

217
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:37,417
So I thought

218
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,817
that it was probably just a temporary disposal place

219
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:44,717
and the perp was planning to move it somewhere else later.

220
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,817
But before the perp could move it,

221
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:50,217
the crime came to light?

222
00:14:50,218 --> 00:14:53,017
And the conclusion this leads us to is...

223
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:56,917
She had an accomplice.

224
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:58,317
What?

225
00:14:58,318 --> 00:15:01,017
Mr. Mouri, just exactly what do you mean?

226
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:02,817
I'm sure that she wants

227
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,317
to hide the evidence as soon as she possibly can.

228
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:07,917
But, according to her scenario,

229
00:15:07,918 --> 00:15:12,517
she is supposed to be shoved into the closet.

230
00:15:12,518 --> 00:15:17,917
If she was spotted disposing of the evidence someplace far away,

231
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,817
there would be discrepancies.

232
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,317
True.

233
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:25,017
That's why an accomplice to help her hide the evidence

234
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:27,217
was indispensible.

235
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,417
I see.

236
00:15:28,418 --> 00:15:30,117
But Mr. Mouri,

237
00:15:30,118 --> 00:15:34,217
the evidence was found in the trash bin of the condo.

238
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:35,517
That's right.

239
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:40,517
I guess some sort of trouble occurred between Saki and her accomplice.

240
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:43,917
That's why the evidence was left as is.

241
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:45,118
Which means...

242
00:15:46,118 --> 00:15:49,718
Saki was murdered by her accomplice.

243
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:57,117
Please look at masking tape that covered Saki's mouth.

244
00:15:57,118 --> 00:16:00,618
There are several lipstick marks all over it.

245
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:05,617
It's because Saki struggled when her accomplice

246
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:08,717
put the tape on her mouth.

247
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,317
If she covered her own mouth with it,

248
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:13,818
there would've been just one lipstick mark on it.

249
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:17,317
True.

250
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:18,517
Yeah.

251
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:21,718
Moreover, please take a good look at the closet.

252
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:26,317
There looks to be nothing in particular.

253
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:30,017
There are too many clothes relative to the volume of the closet.

254
00:16:30,018 --> 00:16:33,117
All the expensive suits will become wrinkle

255
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,718
and no good this way.

256
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:38,817
I see.

257
00:16:38,818 --> 00:16:42,117
Not only that, even the T-shirts

258
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:45,717
that would normally be put away in drawers are hung in the closet.

259
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:48,917
But doesn't that vary from household to household?

260
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:53,017
Some people hang T-shirts on hangers, you know.

261
00:16:53,018 --> 00:16:55,317
Well, I guess so...

262
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:59,917
If you look at the T-shirts as well as some of the other clothes,

263
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:04,417
you can see that some are dirty, some are wrinkled,

264
00:17:04,418 --> 00:17:06,817
some have been in the chest or worn

265
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,618
but despite of this are hung on the rack.

266
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:12,717
Mr. Mouri's right.

267
00:17:12,718 --> 00:17:15,017
This clothes have been worn several times.

268
00:17:15,018 --> 00:17:16,417
The others...

269
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:17,918
Smell like cigarette.

270
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:35,617
And this had been folded.

271
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:39,017
In other words, the accomplice tried to make the scene

272
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:41,517
look as if it were an accident.

273
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,617
Then, who is the perp?

274
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:46,517
Ms. Maiko.

275
00:17:46,518 --> 00:17:49,117
Why did you run over to Saki without listening to me

276
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:50,817
when I tried to stop you?

277
00:17:50,818 --> 00:17:51,917
What?

278
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:54,617
That's because I was worried about Saki.

279
00:17:54,618 --> 00:17:56,517
Really?

280
00:17:56,518 --> 00:17:58,317
Yes!

281
00:17:58,318 --> 00:18:01,117
Isn't it actually because you needed to be the one

282
00:18:01,118 --> 00:18:03,517
who discovered the corpse first?

283
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:05,017
What?

284
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:07,917
Mr. Mouri, just what are you getting at?

285
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:10,017
She was the first discoverer

286
00:18:10,018 --> 00:18:13,817
in order to hide the fact that her prints were on the evidence.

287
00:18:13,818 --> 00:18:15,617
Isn't that right?

288
00:18:15,618 --> 00:18:19,217
Oh, the fingerprints that are on the masking tape.

289
00:18:19,218 --> 00:18:20,717
-Oh. -That!

290
00:18:20,718 --> 00:18:23,217
You're just making things up!

291
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:26,317
I was really worried about Saki.

292
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:28,517
You still won't confess?

293
00:18:28,518 --> 00:18:32,118
Then, will you please show us what is inside you bag?

294
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:35,517
Why do you want to look into my bag?

295
00:18:35,518 --> 00:18:39,117
Saki tried to hide her valuables somewhere.

296
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,517
But as you can see from the fact

297
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:43,017
that she threw the evidence into the trash bin,

298
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:45,618
she could only have thrown them away nearby.

299
00:18:46,518 --> 00:18:49,617
If the police haven't found it yet,

300
00:18:49,618 --> 00:18:53,917
it is highly probable that the accomplice took off with it.

301
00:18:53,918 --> 00:18:56,718
Will you please show me the contents of your bag?

302
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:11,218
This is...

303
00:19:18,618 --> 00:19:20,918
Maiko, why?

304
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:26,918
I went to Saki's room from the emergency stairs.

305
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,418
You're late!

306
00:19:34,218 --> 00:19:35,717
All you have to do is

307
00:19:35,718 --> 00:19:38,418
keep listening to what I tell you to do like usual!

308
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:44,818
Are you scared?

309
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,617
You can't back out anymore, understand?

310
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:52,717
It's like you killed my husband, see.

311
00:19:52,718 --> 00:19:54,217
No...

312
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:57,818
But, that's what accomplice are, right?

313
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,417
The evidence is in the trash bin.

314
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:07,318
Get rid of it.

315
00:20:46,318 --> 00:20:49,117
It was about time that the courier was scheduled to come

316
00:20:49,118 --> 00:20:51,817
so I rushed outside.

317
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:56,017
I didn't have time to move the evidence from the trash bin.

318
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:57,617
Even if the evidence were discovered,

319
00:20:57,618 --> 00:21:00,617
everybody would've thought that Saki committed the crime.

320
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:02,617
You thought so, didn't you?

321
00:21:02,618 --> 00:21:04,217
Yes.

322
00:21:04,218 --> 00:21:06,617
She told me that she would give me some insurance money and besides,

323
00:21:06,618 --> 00:21:11,517
she's always taken care of me since our high school days.

324
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:14,217
But, I got scared.

325
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:18,018
I thought I'd have to do as she said for the rest of my life.

326
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:29,318
I wanted to pull free from her.

327
00:22:57,718 --> 00:23:00,618
"Family restaurant"

328
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:08,917
Are you going to be okay eating like that, Pops?

329
00:23:08,918 --> 00:23:10,017
Idiot!

330
00:23:10,018 --> 00:23:12,517
I missed out on lunch, you know.

331
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:14,818
And besides, as to the money...

332
00:23:17,718 --> 00:23:19,417
What?

333
00:23:19,418 --> 00:23:23,217
It's gone!

334
00:23:23,218 --> 00:23:24,617
What's the matter?

335
00:23:24,618 --> 00:23:29,317
I must've dropped the envelope with the money.

336
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:31,117
What?

337
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,018
What shall I do?

338
00:23:35,518 --> 00:23:39,117
Next it's time to look for the envelope, Pops.

339
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,318
I wanted that reward.

00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:44,317
"Next Episode"

341
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:46,618
A murder motivated by hatred.

342
00:23:49,918 --> 00:23:51,918
What did you come here for?

343
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:57,117
He was dreadfully obnoxious.

344
00:23:57,118 --> 00:24:00,517
Everybody in the neighborhood had a murder motive against him.

345
00:24:00,518 --> 00:24:03,117
-What? -Off the point?

346
00:24:03,118 --> 00:24:06,618
I guess this is one of those ABC murder cases.

347
00:24:07,418 --> 00:24:08,717
Next Conan,

348
00:24:08,718 --> 00:24:12,618
