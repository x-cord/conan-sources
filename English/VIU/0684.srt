1
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:38,876
"If you can kill me, go ahead and try. I'll be waiting inside the room."

2
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:40,876
"I'll be end up killing you, though. -From Daisaku Katsumoto"

3
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:43,576
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

4
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,676
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

5
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:47,576
The text mail that was transmitted simultaneously before the deadly fall

6
00:00:47,576 --> 00:00:49,576
was it a trick to hide the traces of a crime?

7
00:00:49,576 --> 00:00:51,176
He sees through the one and only truth.

8
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,076
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

9
00:00:53,076 --> 00:00:55,776
His name is Detective Conan!

10
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:41,206
"Foam, Steam, and Smoke (Part 1)"

11
00:02:41,206 --> 00:02:42,306
"Mouri Detective Agency"

12
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:43,806
I'm sorry, Conan.

13
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:46,306
It seems dad can't use the car.

14
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:48,406
It seems he was drinking till 5 this morning

15
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:50,706
and he's still sleeping.

16
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:54,006
I'm sorry, but, can you and Ai go there by train?

17
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:56,006
Yes, okay.

18
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:57,306
Be careful, okay?

19
00:02:57,306 --> 00:02:59,006
Yes.

20
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:00,806
Come to think of it,

21
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,406
when I got up, pops wasn't in bed.

22
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:08,306
It seems like you couldn't get Kogoro to drive us over.

23
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:10,806
Darn. It's already 07:00 am.

24
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:12,206
Even if we walk back to the bus stop from now,

25
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:15,006
the ski bus, Dr. Agasa and the others are on would've left already.

26
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:16,806
I told you so.

27
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:19,006
I'm the one who forgot something,

28
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:21,506
so I, alone should've come back.

29
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:22,706
You idiot.

30
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:24,506
I came back with you

31
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:26,206
because there's danger of kidnap

32
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,906
for a child to be walking around alone, you know!

33
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:29,806
I'm no kid.

34
00:03:29,806 --> 00:03:32,406
Outwardly, you look like nothing but a kid!

35
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:34,206
But, just what do you plan to do?

36
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:37,106
We could go there by train

37
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:39,406
but we'd have to spend a lot of time transferring trains

38
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:41,506
and by the time we get there it'll be sundown.

39
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:45,206
It can't be helped we've got no other choice.

40
00:03:45,206 --> 00:03:46,306
We do.

41
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:50,606
We could have Subaru drive us over.

42
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,506
But, you don't mind?

43
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:54,806
No, why would I?

44
00:03:54,806 --> 00:03:57,206
He always looks like he has a lot of time on his hands.

45
00:03:57,206 --> 00:03:59,306
Oh, no, I mean you.

46
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,806
You kept saying you don't like him.

47
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:04,806
I can't keep lingering on my likes and dislikes forever.

48
00:04:04,806 --> 00:04:06,506
I'm no kid.

49
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:09,306
I'm telling you, that outwardly you're nothing but a kid...

50
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:12,706
But in this case, how you look on the outside has nothing to do with it.

51
00:04:12,706 --> 00:04:14,506
Besides, he...

52
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:16,106
maybe...

53
00:04:21,306 --> 00:04:22,506
Yes, yes...

54
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:25,106
"Daisaku Katsumoto" -How boisterous from early morning.

55
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:28,206
It's you.

56
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:30,706
You really came.

57
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:33,606
So, come in, will you I'll hear you out.

58
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,906
It's probably some boring talking anyway, so...

59
00:04:40,606 --> 00:04:42,406
You're all going skiing together?

60
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:43,806
How lucky.

61
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:47,506
If I'm going either way, I guess I'll take a slide too.

62
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:50,206
I haven't moved my body for some time besides.

63
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:54,906
Oh, my, is there any reason why you need to keep your body in shape?

64
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:56,406
Well, of course.

65
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:59,606
Because I'd like to make a good impression on women.

66
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:06,006
Officer Takagi!

67
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:10,006
-Conan. -Staking out?

68
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:13,506
Sort of I just changed shifts with Chiba.

69
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:17,206
But, I'm glad you got back to work faster than expected.

70
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:18,606
Yes.

71
00:05:18,606 --> 00:05:21,606
But I still dream about it even now.

72
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:26,106
Well, the minute I fall off the board,

73
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:27,906
I get up though.

74
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:30,506
I always make it a point to tell myself.

75
00:05:30,506 --> 00:05:33,206
Don't worry. You haven't fallen. You haven't fallen.

76
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:34,906
He fell!

77
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:36,206
Somebody fell!

78
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:39,506
On the other side of the road?

79
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,106
Officer Takagi, go for it!

80
00:05:42,106 --> 00:05:43,406
Let's go to the site.

81
00:05:43,406 --> 00:05:44,906
Come on, hurry.

82
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:46,506
Yes.

83
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:51,506
I saw.

84
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:52,806
Wow!

85
00:05:52,806 --> 00:05:54,006
Excuse me!

86
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,306
Police.

87
00:05:57,306 --> 00:05:58,906
What happened here?

88
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:06,006
This is...

89
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:08,606
I passed by while I was jogging

90
00:06:08,606 --> 00:06:11,206
and suddenly he came falling from above.

91
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:13,306
I saw it too.

92
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,106
This happens to be my dog's walking course.

93
00:06:16,106 --> 00:06:18,806
I wonder if he fell from this condo.

94
00:06:18,806 --> 00:06:21,906
Does anyone know who he is?

95
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:28,006
He's got a cell phone in his chest pocket.

96
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,006
True.

97
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:36,906
He sent out a strange text mail just before he fell.

98
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:41,706
Moreover, he seems to have simultaneously sent mail to several people.

99
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:44,506
Then why don't you try sending it again?

100
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:46,506
Oh, hey!

101
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:56,006
It seems he sent it to those three.

102
00:06:56,006 --> 00:07:00,106
Which means they know this person who fell, right?

103
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:03,006
Why didn't they say anything, then?

104
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,406
"Keisuke Ogino (34)" -Oh, well...

105
00:07:04,406 --> 00:07:07,706
I heard a loud sound and dashed out of my room.

106
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:10,106
I didn't have time to confirm his face or anything.

107
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:12,206
"Kaori Tsukihara (28)" -Same here.

108
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:16,906
His voice was so loud that I spilled the coffee I was drinking.

109
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:19,806
"Kazutomo Sodezaki (31)" -I heard his voice and came too.

110
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:23,306
If the person who fell was the one who sent me mail,

111
00:07:23,306 --> 00:07:25,506
he could be President Katsumoto?

112
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:27,706
-No. -No joke?

113
00:07:27,706 --> 00:07:31,106
Is he the president?

114
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:34,406
Yes, he's the president as well as the editor

115
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:37,006
for Katsumoto publishing company, Daisaku Katsumoto.

116
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:38,606
You know, the magazine "Weekly Great"

117
00:07:38,606 --> 00:07:40,706
that's been selling quite well recently.

118
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:44,706
Yes, the one who writes gossips of talents and such.

119
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:49,006
Both the president and the employees are living in the same condo?

120
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:50,106
It's a coincidence.

121
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:52,006
It's near the company too.

122
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:55,206
I was just thinking of moving out soon, though.

123
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:57,806
I'm a free-lancer and not an employee.

124
00:07:57,806 --> 00:08:00,206
Well, but we live on the 3rd floor

125
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:02,406
and the president lives on the 26th.

126
00:08:02,406 --> 00:08:03,806
I see.

127
00:08:03,806 --> 00:08:07,806
Then, may I ask you to please come to the station with me?

128
00:08:07,806 --> 00:08:11,106
I've got a lot of things that I'd like to ask you.

129
00:08:11,106 --> 00:08:12,906
Hey, hold it.

130
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:15,006
Are you suspecting us?

131
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:16,206
I told you, didn't I?

132
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:18,706
That I was in my room till just a while ago.

133
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,506
Is there anyone who can verify that for you?

134
00:08:22,906 --> 00:08:24,406
I don't think there is.

135
00:08:24,406 --> 00:08:26,606
Because all three of us, live alone.

136
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:31,806
Then, why don't we go to the rooms of the three now?

137
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:34,006
It's only been less than 4 minutes

138
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:36,106
since we heard the voice say, "He fell!" you see!

139
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:41,206
We might find something, right?

140
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:49,306
I wonder if anything can be found by checking the rooms?

141
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:51,706
Judging from the corpse,

142
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:54,306
he seems to have fallen from quite a high place.

143
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:56,306
If this is murder,

144
00:08:56,306 --> 00:09:00,306
the culprit probably pushed this man out from his room

145
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,406
and rushed over down here.

146
00:09:03,406 --> 00:09:06,506
If traces of you having been in your room till a while ago, are found,

147
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:08,806
you'll be taken off the suspect's list.

148
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:11,406
You're being asked to show your rooms right now,

149
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:15,006
because Officer Takagi happened to be at the scene.

150
00:09:15,006 --> 00:09:18,506
The culprit couldn't have known this,

151
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:20,406
so he wouldn't have had to go through the trouble

152
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:21,506
of going back into his room

153
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:26,006
to make it look as though he had been there all the while.

154
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:29,506
You sure know a lot when it comes to murder, don't you?

155
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:32,706
Yes, I'm a Sherlockian.

156
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,306
But, I'm not interested in the killing,

157
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:37,406
I'm only interested in, solving the mystery part.

158
00:09:37,406 --> 00:09:38,906
Is that so...

159
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:45,906
Okay, will Ms. Kaori and Mr. Sodesaki stand

160
00:09:45,906 --> 00:09:48,206
and wait here with the door open?

161
00:09:48,206 --> 00:09:49,206
-Yes. -Yes.

162
00:09:58,106 --> 00:10:00,206
What is it? That package?

163
00:10:00,206 --> 00:10:02,306
It's a package with return gifts from a funeral

164
00:10:02,306 --> 00:10:04,306
that I attended the other day.

165
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:09,406
And? What's the proof that you were here till just a while ago?

166
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:13,806
See, the TV is on.

167
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:17,406
Well, I don't think that it will be enough to...

168
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:20,506
How about this?

169
00:10:20,506 --> 00:10:23,706
There's still this much beer foam left here.

170
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,306
It's because I was drinking beer

171
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:27,106
and watching TV till just a while ago.

172
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:28,806
I see.

173
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:32,106
Proof that I was in this room till a while ago.

174
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:33,506
I wonder if I can find something.

175
00:10:36,006 --> 00:10:39,606
You went to the same funeral as Mr. Ogino too, didn't you?

176
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:43,606
Yes. All three of us went.

177
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:45,906
The president didn't come though.

178
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:48,406
This coffee?

179
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:53,006
That's the coffee I was drinking before I left the room.

180
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:56,106
I can't start my day without my morning coffee.

181
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:59,206
Then, this will for the time being, serve as proof.

182
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:01,906
There still some steam rising from it too.

183
00:11:03,906 --> 00:11:05,506
Officer, hurry, hurry!

184
00:11:05,506 --> 00:11:07,106
Hurry and look officer!

185
00:11:07,106 --> 00:11:08,906
Please calm down.

186
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:12,206
After I heard about the steam of Ms. Tsukihara's coffee a while ago,

187
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:13,806
I happened to remember.

188
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:19,006
No good. They're all snuffed out.

189
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:22,506
I left the cigarette standing in the ashtray when I left the room,

190
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:26,106
so I thought it'd still be lit, but...

191
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:27,606
Please look, see.

192
00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:29,906
The smoke's still rising, isn't it?

193
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:32,506
This is proof that I was here till just a while ago.

194
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:34,306
True.

195
00:11:35,606 --> 00:11:39,206
Which means that none of you three went to the president's room?

196
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:40,206
No.

197
00:11:40,206 --> 00:11:41,606
Of course not.

198
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:44,106
We've been saying so all this time, haven't we?

199
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:47,306
The things that will serve as proof of the alibis are...

200
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:51,606
foam, steam, and smoke.

201
00:11:53,527 --> 00:11:56,527
Foam, steam, and smoke?

202
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:58,327
Are you telling me that such intangible things

203
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:00,127
are going to serve as alibis?

204
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,327
Oh, yes.

205
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:03,627
Please let me explain it to you in chronological order.

206
00:12:03,627 --> 00:12:07,027
At about 07:30 am, when I changed shifts staking out

207
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,927
and was on my way back to the station,

208
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:11,627
I heard somebody shout, "A man fell!",

209
00:12:11,627 --> 00:12:14,127
and came running up to this condo.

210
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:17,127
Then, I see a man dressed in PJs and a gown on the ground.

211
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:18,827
From the testimony of the eye-witness,

212
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:23,227
I found that the man had fallen from the top floor of the condo.

213
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:25,927
A cell phone was in the pocket of the man so,

214
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:27,227
I checked it

215
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:29,827
and found that at 07:25 am, just before he fell,

216
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:33,227
he simultaneously sent several people text mail.

217
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:36,027
Then, when I tried re-sending the mail...

218
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:40,427
I see.

219
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:44,927
So, these three received a provoking mail

220
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,427
as if to encourage committing the murder.

221
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:48,627
Yes.

222
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:49,827
We found that the man who fell,

223
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:52,827
was company president Mr. Daisaku Katsumoto,

224
00:12:52,827 --> 00:12:55,527
who worked with the three.

225
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:57,727
Since the contents of the mail were as such,

226
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,227
I was going to ask the three to come voluntarily

227
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:03,427
to the station for interrogation,

228
00:13:03,427 --> 00:13:05,027
but, after the suggestion that going to their room right away

229
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:06,827
may show evidence of them having been in the room

230
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,127
till just before the incident.

231
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:11,327
You went to the rooms of the three

232
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:12,827
and were shown the foam of the beer,

233
00:13:12,827 --> 00:13:15,027
the steam in the coffee cup

234
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,527
and the smoke from the cigarette,

235
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:18,327
is that the story?

236
00:13:18,327 --> 00:13:19,827
Yes, sir.

237
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:22,127
If one of the three were the culprit that pushed...

238
00:13:22,127 --> 00:13:25,127
President Katsumoto from the condo,

239
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:27,727
and that person was mixed among the spectators

240
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:29,827
that person would've come here right away

241
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:31,927
without going anywhere else.

242
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:35,627
After all, the sooner that person's witnessed here, the better,

243
00:13:35,627 --> 00:13:37,827
because when questioned later,

244
00:13:37,827 --> 00:13:40,227
the person can insist that he heard the commotion

245
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:41,527
and rushed down here right away.

246
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:44,327
But as for the foam, steam, and smoke,

247
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:45,927
you're the only one who saw them, right?

248
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:47,927
I took a picture of them too.

249
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,727
I took it with my cell phone camera, though.

250
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:53,527
Conan?

251
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:55,627
I coincidentally happened to run into Conan

252
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,827
and the others on the street in their car,

253
00:13:57,827 --> 00:14:01,927
when I heard the voice shouting that somebody fell.

254
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:05,627
And, you mean you took Conan

255
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:08,327
to the room of someone who could possibly be a murderer?

256
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:12,327
Yes, because Conan's the one who said

257
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:13,627
that we should immediately go to the rooms.

258
00:14:13,627 --> 00:14:15,227
But...

259
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:17,327
See, look.

260
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:20,327
This is Mr. Ogino's beer foam.

261
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:23,127
This is the steam from Ms. Tsukihara's coffee cup.

262
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:26,227
Since it's hard to see in a photo, I took a video of this one only.

263
00:14:26,227 --> 00:14:30,227
And, this is the smoke from Mr. Sodesaki's cigarette.

264
00:14:30,227 --> 00:14:32,827
To make it easy to tell who's room it was,

265
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:34,127
I had each resident of the room hold the thing up

266
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:35,627
before taking the picture.

267
00:14:35,627 --> 00:14:37,027
Where were the two remaining people

268
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:38,427
when the picture was being taken?

269
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:41,427
I had them wait right outside the entrance with the door open.

270
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:46,027
Therefore, they didn't have time to go back to their rooms

271
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:48,427
and change anything.

272
00:14:49,427 --> 00:14:52,827
And? Are you sure that President Katsumoto fell off

273
00:14:52,827 --> 00:14:57,927
from the veranda of his room that's on the 26th floor of this condo?

274
00:14:57,927 --> 00:14:59,027
Yes, sir.

275
00:14:59,027 --> 00:15:03,127
The front door as well as the veranda window were left opened.

276
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:05,327
Right after the president sent the mail in question out,

277
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:09,327
he seems to have called the renovators too.

278
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:11,727
-Renovators? -Yes, sir

279
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:12,927
It seems that the carpet

280
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:15,127
that the president ordered and was installed last night,

281
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:17,927
was not what he ordered.

282
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:22,327
It seems that he actually measured the fluffiness of the carpet

283
00:15:22,327 --> 00:15:24,927
while on the phone and complained.

284
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,427
While he was on the phone,

285
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,927
the door bell seems to have rung,

286
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,827
and he hung up saying that he would call back later.

287
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:36,427
President Katsumoto was in his room until right before he fell

288
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:39,127
and it seems safe to say that the person who came to visit him

289
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:40,827
is the culprit.

290
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:43,527
By the way, how long does it take

291
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:46,227
to get from their room to the president's?

292
00:15:46,227 --> 00:15:48,827
Since all three of them live on the 3rd floor,

293
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:52,327
to get to the president's room that is 23 floors above,

294
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:55,427
it would take about 7 minutes to go and come back.

295
00:15:55,427 --> 00:15:58,727
I actually used the stairs and tried it out myself,

296
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:00,227
so there's no mistake about it.

297
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:01,827
You used the stairs?

298
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,127
You didn't use the elevator?

299
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:07,127
There's a surveillance camera in the elevator,

300
00:16:07,127 --> 00:16:09,927
and when I had them show me the image on the camera in the control room,

301
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,527
at the time President Katsumoto fell, around 07:30 am,

302
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:16,427
the images of the three weren't found.

303
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:19,727
Therefore, if one of them is the culprit,

304
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:22,927
I thought they took the stairs that had no camera.

305
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:24,227
I see.

306
00:16:24,227 --> 00:16:26,827
The culprit rang the door bell of the president's room,

307
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:30,427
and after being invited in, pushed him off.

308
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:33,227
If you calculate the time it would take to get out of the room

309
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:34,227
and run to the first floor,

310
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,327
and you add the time it took you to enter

311
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:37,827
the rooms of the three after the incident...

312
00:16:37,827 --> 00:16:40,627
If anyone among the three is the culprit,

313
00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:43,027
it would mean that the person would've had to leave his room empty

314
00:16:43,027 --> 00:16:44,127
for more than 10 minutes.

315
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:45,327
Yes, sir.

316
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:46,627
If left behind for that long,

317
00:16:46,627 --> 00:16:50,427
I figured that the foam, steam, and smoke would've been long gone.

318
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,227
I see.

319
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:56,127
But why did the president send you all a mail like that?

320
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:57,527
Because of the lawsuit.

321
00:16:57,527 --> 00:17:01,227
All three of us were planning to sue that president.

322
00:17:01,227 --> 00:17:03,427
At the beginning of next month.

323
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:04,627
Sue?

324
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:06,227
You know about it, don't you?

325
00:17:06,227 --> 00:17:09,527
The incident about the popular actress who jumped to her death last week.

326
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:13,327
Yes. If I remember correctly, she committed suicide

327
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:15,227
because her kiss scene with her "dangerous" lover

328
00:17:15,227 --> 00:17:17,927
made the headlines, right?

329
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:20,427
I'm the one who took the picture.

330
00:17:20,427 --> 00:17:22,727
I'm the one who wrote the article.

331
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:26,327
And, I'm supposedly the one who edited it

332
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:28,727
and put it in the Weekly Magazine Great.

333
00:17:28,727 --> 00:17:29,927
Supposedly?

334
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:33,827
Yes. Because the picture as well as the article are lies.

335
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:39,927
That picture was taken right before they hugged each other.

336
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:42,027
They weren't kissing or anything.

337
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,027
The background of her boyfriend in the photo,

338
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:46,027
that's written in the article, is full of baloney.

339
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:47,927
He happens to be a stunt man,

340
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:49,827
and the wound on his face is one that he got

341
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:51,027
from shooting a film that day.

342
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:55,527
But, she was engaged with a young Diet member, wasn't she?

343
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:57,627
In spite of that, if she was in somebody else's arms,

344
00:17:57,627 --> 00:18:00,027
it's not all baloney, is it?

345
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:02,027
That's wrong too.

346
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:04,527
He was her half younger brother, from her father's side,

347
00:18:04,527 --> 00:18:08,227
and was only hugging him telling him that she was getting married.

348
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:10,427
But, why, then?

349
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:12,827
We found all this out before we put it on the magazine

350
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:14,827
and was going to trash it.

351
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,527
But, that President Katsumoto re-wrote it without permission,

352
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:18,927
and put it in the magazine.

353
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:20,127
He wrote up a headline,

354
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:22,027
"Popular Actress, Plays Dangerous Love Till Late

355
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:24,127
on the Night Before her Wedding"!

356
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,727
Since the day that magazine was to go out on the market,

357
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:30,827
was the day before her coming wedding with the groom-to-be Diet member,

358
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:32,827
the magazine sold fast, but...

359
00:18:32,827 --> 00:18:37,627
Her younger brother was attacked by a fanatic fan of hers

360
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:40,727
and is in the hospital even now, unconscious and in critical condition.

361
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:42,827
Her marriage, most naturally shattered to pieces,

362
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:46,827
and losing all hope, she chose suicide as a way out.

363
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,227
But, if she told him the truth right away,

364
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:53,327
it would've become obvious that everything was a lie, no?

365
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:55,227
She couldn't come out and tell him

366
00:18:55,227 --> 00:18:59,527
because her younger brother was the child of her father's mistress.

367
00:18:59,527 --> 00:19:02,427
But, I'm sure that the president wrote the article

368
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:04,027
because he saw through everything.

369
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:05,827
But, it's totally unforgivable for him

370
00:19:05,827 --> 00:19:10,127
to use our names without permission and make up an article.

371
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:15,627
That's why all three of us sent that guy our signed mail last night.

372
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:17,527
We wrote that we had proof that he made that article up,

373
00:19:17,527 --> 00:19:20,427
so to be ready to take the consequences.

374
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:24,427
That we would keep on filing action against him until he's no more.

375
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:25,927
I see.

376
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:28,427
So the president saw that mail this morning

377
00:19:28,427 --> 00:19:31,427
and sent you all the mail that he did.

378
00:19:31,427 --> 00:19:36,227
Then, the funeral package that was found in the rooms of you three was...

379
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:37,327
Yes.

380
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:40,027
It's the return gift that we received

381
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:41,327
after attending that actress's funeral.

382
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:44,327
Well, but we all kept our names hidden

383
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:45,927
and attended her funeral under the pretense

384
00:19:45,927 --> 00:19:49,227
of being people who were involved with her production company

385
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:51,227
If that article is the motive,

386
00:19:51,227 --> 00:19:53,327
shouldn't we include the bereaved family of the deceased actress

387
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:55,427
in the list of suspects too?

388
00:19:56,627 --> 00:20:01,127
But, the murder occurred right after the mail was sent.

389
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:02,627
It doesn't seem right

390
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:04,927
to take these three completely off the list of suspects.

391
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:06,527
That's true.

392
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,627
The timing is too good for it to be a coincidence.

393
00:20:09,627 --> 00:20:11,827
But the foam, steam, and smoke are proof

394
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:15,027
that they didn't do it.

395
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:18,127
I thought that we would find something

396
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:21,727
if we entered the room before any trick could be set up but...

397
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:23,627
Or is there a way?

398
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:26,127
A method, to set something up on the spot.

399
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:30,827
Yes, hello.

400
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:32,427
Conan?

401
00:20:32,427 --> 00:20:35,027
About when do you think you'll be arriving here?

402
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:37,827
We've started skiing already.

403
00:20:37,827 --> 00:20:40,127
Call us when you get here, okay?

404
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:41,827
We'll be waiting for you, okay!

405
00:20:41,827 --> 00:20:42,827
Sorry.

406
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:44,827
I got caught up in a case here,

407
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,327
so I don't think I'll be able to go there.

408
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:48,527
What? No joke!

409
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:51,427
Conan says he can't come because of a criminal case.

410
00:20:51,427 --> 00:20:53,627
You mean Ai can't either?

411
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,927
I guess not.

412
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:57,127
Why don't you just let somebody else handle the case?

413
00:20:57,127 --> 00:21:00,827
All our breaths are super white here, and it feels really good.

414
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:03,227
Breath is white?

415
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:05,827
Sorry. I'll call you again later.

416
00:21:05,827 --> 00:21:07,527
Conan?

417
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:08,727
He hung up.

418
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,027
Inspector Megure.

419
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:14,627
Why don't we experiment while we're at it?

420
00:21:14,627 --> 00:21:16,027
Experiment?

421
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:19,827
Yes, an experiment with foam, steam, and smoke.

422
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:47,427
So...

423
00:22:47,427 --> 00:22:50,227
I wonder what he's planning to do now?

424
00:22:50,227 --> 00:22:51,327
What about?

425
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:53,027
Skiing.

426
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:55,327
Aren't Dr. Agasa and the others waiting?

427
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:58,127
He's probably going to cancel going.

428
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,427
The phone call that he got a while ago

429
00:23:00,427 --> 00:23:01,927
was probably from the children.

430
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:04,427
He probably said something like,

431
00:23:04,427 --> 00:23:06,227
"I can't go because of a criminal case",

432
00:23:06,227 --> 00:23:07,927
or something to that effect, and cancelled.

433
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:09,627
Like always.

434
00:23:09,627 --> 00:23:11,127
I see.

435
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:12,927
That's too bad.

436
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:15,727
So, you can go on home if you want to already.

437
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,127
You don't have to drive us anywhere anymore.

438
00:23:18,127 --> 00:23:21,927
No, I'm concerned how the case is coming along too.

439
00:23:21,927 --> 00:23:25,327
Besides, I couldn't possibly leave a fragile little lady all by herself

440
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:26,527
and leave.

441
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:30,827
Because a murderer may be hanging around somewhere too.

442
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:33,127
You sure are an unreliable knight.

443
00:23:34,227 --> 00:23:36,327
You're a tough one, aren't you?

444
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:41,927
I'll protect you over my dead body, princess.

445
00:23:52,827 --> 00:23:54,327
I wonder if this the first time...

446
00:23:54,327 --> 00:23:57,427
that I've been with you, just the two of us.

447
00:23:57,427 --> 00:24:00,027
What shall we do about those three, inspector?

448
00:24:01,627 --> 00:24:04,227
They all have enough motive,

449
00:24:04,227 --> 00:24:07,527
I guess we'll have them interrogated a bit longer.

450
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:09,727
Because we'll find out if we stay here...

451
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:12,027
who the culprit is.

452
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:18,327
Next Conan,

453
00:24:18,327 --> 00:24:22,327
"Foam, Steam, and Smoke (Part 2)".
