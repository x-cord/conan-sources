1
00:00:00,828 --> 00:00:07,228
Tohru Amuro, who got to know since the DNA case some days ago

2
00:00:07,228 --> 00:00:14,328
claimed Raita Nanba, Pops' friend as being the culprit,

3
00:00:14,328 --> 00:00:15,628
but Pops on the contrary,

4
00:00:15,628 --> 00:00:20,728
proves that this was not homicide, but a suicide case.

5
00:00:20,728 --> 00:00:24,328
Amuro, who is deeply impressed by Pops' deduction

6
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:25,628
decides to part-time at Poirot

7
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:28,228
that is located below the detective agency,

8
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:32,328
and learn detective work under Pops.

9
00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:36,928
The vivid colored memories of summer.

10
00:00:36,928 --> 00:00:38,928
Solve mysteries all season round.

11
00:00:38,928 --> 00:00:40,728
Going to and fro the detective agency.

12
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:43,028
An unbelievable occurrence in the wink of an eye.

13
00:00:43,028 --> 00:00:44,728
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:46,728
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:00:46,728 --> 00:00:48,828
His name is Detective Conan.

16
00:02:28,323 --> 00:02:33,923
"Nocturne of the Detectives (The Case)"

17
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:37,266
This is the image of the three bank robbers

18
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:40,766
that has been publicized this time.

19
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:44,066
Now, these three are still on the run and...

20
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:48,466
I tell you, all they've been airing since this morning is this news.

21
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:50,066
It can't be helped.

22
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:53,466
It's only been less than a week since the incident occurred, and moreover,

23
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:56,866
it seems that one banker was shot to death too.

24
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:59,766
If I remember correctly, the guy was killed because he tried to be cool

25
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:01,966
and went up against the robbers or something.

26
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:04,966
I don't think he went against the robbers.

27
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:08,566
According to one of the customers who was at the bank at that time,

28
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:12,366
he raised his hands like this and said, "Okay, cut it out already"

29
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,866
and tried to calm the robbers down.

30
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:18,566
But, it's all the same if he did what he did and got the robbers angry,

31
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,966
then got shot to death.

32
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:24,666
But, you sure can't do bad things, can you?

33
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,066
After all, the 200 million yen

34
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:30,166
that was just brought in from the main bank were all new bills,

35
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,366
so the numbers on the bills were clearly identifiable.

36
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:37,366
Yeah, they got a bunch of money they can't use.

37
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:41,466
So it's just a matter of time until the robbers get caught.

38
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:45,266
I mean, how come you're here?

39
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,466
I came to bring you, Mr. Mouri,

40
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:49,966
the one who's taking care of me, sandwiches for lunch.

41
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:52,966
Of course it's on me.

42
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,366
You mean there's some for us too?

43
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:56,666
Well, of course!

44
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,366
Thank you very much.

45
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:02,266
No problem, if for Mouri Sensei, this is nothing.

46
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:05,666
What a carefree character.

47
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:09,666
And, the client that's coming today, what kind of case is it?

48
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,566
What? Why do you know about it?

49
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:14,466
Of course I know about it.

50
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:17,166
Well, on holiday afternoons you usually spend your time

51
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,266
slacking off with a horse racing newspaper in hand.

52
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:24,966
But today, you're clean shaven and wearing a necktie.

53
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:28,466
It's as if you're waiting for someone to come over.

54
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:30,966
Just as expected of you, Mr. Amuro.

55
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:34,366
At this rate, there's no need to practice your skills under Dad.

56
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:39,266
Oh, no. This is all thanks to teachings from Mr. Mouri.

57
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:41,966
You're doing quite well, Amuro.

58
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:44,766
Thank you very much.

59
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:51,066
Moreover, Yoko Okino's supposed to be on air now.

60
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:52,766
Despite this, you're not watching it,

61
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:55,566
and seem to be straining your nerves,

62
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:58,566
so it must be some great case that you've got on your hands.

63
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:05,366
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go, Yoko!

64
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:08,966
This is...

65
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,866
He changed the time he was supposed to meet the client

66
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:13,266
just so that he could watch this live.

67
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:16,366
Go! Yoko!

68
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:19,166
Pops is really carefree too.

69
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:24,766
Tune in next week for the goodwill soccer match.

70
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:33,366
So was I right about the client showing up soon?

71
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:35,466
Yeah.

72
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:39,166
But I don't know what kind of person's coming.

73
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:43,466
Because after all, this is the first client

74
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:45,566
who came through the internet requesting work to be done.

75
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:47,266
"Mouri Detective Agency"

76
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:50,366
So you set up your detective agency website?

77
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:51,966
Just as expected of you, Mouri Sensei.

78
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:53,666
You're capable of doing something like this too.

79
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,566
Well, sort of.

80
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:58,166
I thought that it was about time that we go

81
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,366
in keeping with the global world and turn to digital, you know.

82
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:05,266
Well, I'm the one who made the website, though.

83
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:10,066
All I have to do now is enter the password.

84
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:14,466
Conan, you're really something.

85
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:16,966
Doc taught me how to do it.

86
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:22,266
So, now that the live broadcast is over.

87
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:25,466
It's about time that the client gets here.

88
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,466
Mail?

89
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:31,066
Let see.

90
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:35,266
"I'm Kei Kashizuka who was scheduled to meet you there today,

91
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,566
but I would like to change the meeting place

92
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:40,766
to Restaurant Colombo because of personal reasons.

93
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:43,266
The restaurant is quite near from there,

94
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:46,066
and I'm sure that I can meet you on time.

95
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:49,366
I will be waiting to hear from you whether this is okay or not", it says.

96
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:51,566
Humbug.

97
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:52,866
Maybe I should just refuse.

98
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:56,666
No, Dad! It's a client, you know.

99
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,566
Besides, Conan and I haven't eaten lunch yet,

100
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:01,566
so we could eat at Colombo.

101
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:03,866
Okay, then. What about these sandwiches?

102
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:08,666
We'll keep this in the refrigerator and have it for dinner.

103
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:13,566
Sandwiches for dinner?

104
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,466
Dad, the ashes from your cigarette's going to fall.

105
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:19,966
Hey, Dad! Be careful, will you!

106
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:22,466
What if it catches fire?

107
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:25,866
Well, but thanks to someone slacking off in this house,

108
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:27,666
we're into hot water even without the help of fire, I guess!

109
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,966
Oh, nice play on words.

110
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:32,966
Then, will it be alright for me

111
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:36,566
to accompany you when you meet this client, Mouri Sensei?

112
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:39,366
My shift at Poirot today is till afternoon.

113
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:42,566
Oh, yeah, I don't mind.

114
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:45,766
If you're coming with me, pay tuition like you should!

115
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,266
Well, of course!

116
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:54,566
Okay, Mouri Sensei.

117
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:56,266
You go on ahead,

118
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:58,966
I'll go get my coat and meet you there.

119
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,466
"Colombo Restaurant"

120
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:10,366
The key of a coin locker?

121
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,366
Yeah. It seems that the key was found among

122
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,166
the belongings of the late older brother,

123
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,666
who passed away the other day.

124
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,066
Since the client couldn't figure out which locker the key was for,

125
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,066
he wants me to figure it out.

126
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,366
If it's for something important,

127
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:25,166
he wants to put it in the coffin of his brother, he says.

128
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,666
But can you figure it out?

129
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:31,166
Keys usually have the manufacturer's name and serial number on them,

130
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,166
so it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out,

131
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,966
if I can get a hold of the company

132
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:37,166
and ask them where they delivered the locker,

133
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,866
we'll get a general idea of where it is.

134
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:43,066
It much easier than I thought.

135
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:44,966
I guess.

136
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:50,166
Is that all there is to it, your client's request?

137
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,366
Yeah, and the client's offering me 300,000 yen for it,

138
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,666
so it's a great job, don't you think?

139
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,266
True.

140
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:59,266
If so, why say it's humbug?

141
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:12,666
The client is not here yet.

142
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,766
Yeah.

143
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:18,166
Maybe there's another restaurant by the name of Colombo near here?

144
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,466
No, there isn't.

145
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:23,066
You sent an okay mail back to the mail

146
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:25,466
that asked if you would agree to change the meeting place, right?

147
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:28,766
Yeah! I answered right away.

148
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:32,766
I'm repeatedly sending mail saying, "I'll be waiting for you there."

149
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:34,766
But, I'm getting no response.

150
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:36,066
I see.

151
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:39,466
The mail address of the mail I got last night,

152
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:43,066
and the mail I received a while ago is different.

153
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,066
What?

154
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:47,466
Maybe the client's cell phone is being charge

155
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:49,466
and so he had to borrow his friend's cell phone

156
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:52,066
to rush and send the text mail a while ago?

157
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:56,166
And that friend switched off the power of the cell phone or something?

158
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,566
Hey, I sent the okay mail

159
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:00,866
to the text mail I received a while ago, you know.

160
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,966
If so, then maybe he's still waiting

161
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:06,566
at the detective agency, the first meeting place,

162
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:08,866
unaware of the okay mail that came in.

163
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:11,666
Well, there's no one waiting there.

164
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,666
True.

165
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,466
I did send a mail, "I'll be right back"

166
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:18,166
to the first mail address, though.

167
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,566
Then, I'm sure he'll be answering you soon.

168
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:23,466
Why don't I get some tea and we'll wait while having tea?

169
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:26,666
Okay. Since I drank too much coffee at Colombo.

170
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,166
I've got to go to the restroom.

171
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:31,066
Oh, Ran, I'll help you make tea.

172
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:34,166
Thanks. Then can you get the teacups?

173
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,766
With pleasure.

174
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,966
Reply from the client!

175
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:47,266
He says he arrived at Colombo just now, so he'd like me to go there.

176
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:49,266
If so, we'd better rush over!

177
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:51,966
-Yeah. -I'll go with you,

178
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:53,066
so wait for me, will you!

179
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:56,366
I've got to go to the restroom first.

180
00:10:57,766 --> 00:11:00,266
Mail from the client again.

181
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:03,466
He says for all of us to rush over.

182
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:06,166
All of us? You mean us too?

183
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,266
Who else is there?

184
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:11,766
Then, let's all scoot back to Colombo together.

185
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:13,566
Come, come, everyone, let's hurry.

186
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:17,566
So! We'd better hurry or the client will get impatient.

187
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:20,866
Really, I mean, I think it'll suffice for just me to go and yet!

188
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:21,866
Well...

189
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:25,166
But, he's saying everybody, right?

190
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:30,066
Be quiet, everyone.

191
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:32,566
I'm sure this is how the story goes.

192
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:36,266
Someone who didn't want the client to see you,

193
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:39,366
lured you out using fake mail.

194
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,366
After the agency was emptied out, that certain someone set himself up

195
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:43,666
as an imposter as one of your employees,

196
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,066
and waited at the agency for the client to appear.

197
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,166
As proof of that.

198
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:53,566
There are traces of the lock being forced open on the keyhole of this door.

199
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:55,866
And, in the dish cabinet in the kitchen,

200
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:58,966
there was a slightly wet teacup.

201
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:00,666
Judging from your personality, Ran,

202
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,766
You would never put set dishes back into the cabinet

203
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:04,166
without wiping them, would you?

204
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,166
No.

205
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:11,166
Besides, the ashes that Pop's dropped on the table before we left

206
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,166
is wiped clean.

207
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:17,666
Isn't it because someone wiped it off while all of us were out?

208
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:21,266
In other words, these are traces of someone

209
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:24,866
having invited the client in, cleaned the table

210
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:27,566
and served tea.

211
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:30,966
Since the teacup was put back without being completely wiped,

212
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:33,666
it was still wet.

213
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,766
But why would someone do something like that?

214
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:39,166
Because all the client wanted, was to look for the coin locker.

215
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,166
Maybe something unthinkable is inside the locker?

216
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,266
I wonder about that.

217
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:44,866
Why don't we...

218
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,066
ask the person himself?

219
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:50,266
The person himself?

220
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:51,766
Don't tell me that...

221
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:54,166
You got a reply mail just as you were about

222
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,366
to go to the restroom, didn't you, Sensei?

223
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:59,766
And, just when Conan was about to go to the restroom too.

224
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:02,666
Moreover, on the floor of the restroom

225
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,566
there was a trace of something having been dragged along!

226
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:06,766
What?

227
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:08,666
Right.

228
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,566
Most probably that someone for some reason,

229
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:13,066
has the client with him

230
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:15,466
and is still here

231
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:18,466
hiding inside the restroom.

232
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,266
Don't tell me...

233
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,266
What?

234
00:13:33,585 --> 00:13:36,185
Then, is this what you're saying?

235
00:13:36,185 --> 00:13:40,085
Ms. Kei Kashizuka, you came here

236
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,585
to have Mr. Mouri investigate the coin locker case,

237
00:13:43,585 --> 00:13:46,585
but were welcomed in by someone who called himself Mr. Mouri's disciple,

238
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:48,685
and fainted after being attacked with a stun gun.

239
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:51,585
When you came to, you were tied up with masking tape

240
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:54,285
and shoved into the restroom.

241
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:55,885
Yes.

242
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:58,385
My boots including my shoelaces were removed

243
00:13:58,385 --> 00:14:00,785
so that I wouldn't be able to flee.

244
00:14:01,785 --> 00:14:04,885
After Mouri and the others came back,

245
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,985
the man who thought that they found you

246
00:14:06,985 --> 00:14:09,285
confined in the restroom, panicked,

247
00:14:09,285 --> 00:14:14,585
put the gun in his mouth and committed suicide?

248
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:15,685
Yes.

249
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:19,785
But, why did that man hide you in the restroom?

250
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:24,285
I was being questioned right through,

251
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:27,385
what locker this key was for?

252
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:30,485
He said he would kill me if I didn't tell him.

253
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:33,985
Inspector Megure.

254
00:14:33,985 --> 00:14:35,585
According to forensics,

255
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:38,085
virtually no traces of discharge residue

256
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,785
were found on her clothes or her body.

257
00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:43,785
In other words, that man committed suicide.

258
00:14:43,785 --> 00:14:47,285
Does that mean that Ms. Kashizuka's testimony is fact.

259
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:49,285
Yes, sir, it's most likely.

260
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:50,385
Okay!

261
00:14:50,385 --> 00:14:53,285
First of all, let's find where the locker is located

262
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:55,585
and find out what the guy who committed suicide was after.

263
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:57,285
Yes, sir!

264
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:07,285
However, I don't understand.

265
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:12,085
Why did this man bring Ms. Kashizuka in here?

266
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:13,785
All he wanted to do was to ask her

267
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:17,885
where the locker of this key was, wasn't it?

268
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:19,485
That's right.

269
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,385
He could've threatened her using a gun,

270
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:25,185
moved somewhere else and interrogate her,

271
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,285
but instead he passed her out using a stun gun,

272
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:28,285
and tied her up with masking tape.

273
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:33,285
This could mean that he was planning to stay confined here for a while.

274
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:37,485
And of all things, he kills himself with his gun.

275
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:39,785
Well, it could be that he resigned himself

276
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:45,085
because I, Kogoro Mouri came back earlier than he expected.

277
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:49,385
You're not the one who realized that though.

278
00:15:49,385 --> 00:15:52,685
He seemed really freaked out.

279
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,185
He was saying that he'd be in big trouble

280
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:56,885
if he couldn't find the coin locker as soon as possible.

281
00:15:56,885 --> 00:15:58,885
But, Ms. Kashizuka,

282
00:15:58,885 --> 00:16:02,885
is it really true that you've never seen that man before?

283
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:04,885
No, sir. Not at all.

284
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:06,885
If that guy was after the key

285
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:10,085
that was among your older brother's belongings,

286
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:13,685
it's highly probable that he could've been an acquaintance of your brother.

287
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:17,885
I haven't met any of my older brother's friends, you see.

288
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:22,985
By the way, why did your older brother pass away?

289
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:27,485
What was the cause of your older brother's death?

290
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:29,785
What was the cause of your brother's death?

291
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:34,085
Oh, yes. He died of an accident four days ago.

292
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:37,185
This is my older brother.

293
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:41,385
You have his picture as a standby display on your cell phone.

294
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:44,785
This man. He looks familiar.

295
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:48,685
Talking about cell phones.

296
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:52,585
The cell phone of this guy that committed suicide is weird.

297
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:53,585
Weird?

298
00:16:53,585 --> 00:16:55,685
The mail that he sent to Mr. Mouri,

299
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:57,385
feigning to be Ms. Kashizuka

300
00:16:57,385 --> 00:17:01,585
asking to change the place of meeting is in the mail sent history,

301
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:03,985
but there are no other mails at all.

302
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:09,985
Oh, that man. As to the mails

303
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:12,785
after that mail he was using my cell phone.

304
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:13,985
But, even so being that,

305
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:17,285
that is all that's left of received and sent mails is.

306
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:19,285
The address book is also completely blank,

307
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:22,285
despite it not looking to be such a new model.

308
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:25,785
Maybe he bought an old model cell phone at a cheap price?

309
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:27,885
It practically has no scratches or anything on it either.

310
00:17:27,885 --> 00:17:30,585
Besides, the loose change and wallet

311
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:34,385
that were in his pocket along with the cell phone also bother me.

312
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:36,085
Loose change and wallet?

313
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:38,185
The loose change was in his inner pocket of his jacket

314
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:40,185
top along with the key of the locker he took from Ms. Kashizuka,

315
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:45,885
together with the stun gun, cigarette and lighter,

316
00:17:45,885 --> 00:17:48,785
but the total amount of loose change added up to almost 5,000 yen.

317
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:50,685
5,000 yen?

318
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:53,685
With so much, wouldn't it jingle noisily and be heavy too?

319
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:54,885
Yeah.

320
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:57,885
Moreover, in his wallet there were two 10,000 yen bills,

321
00:17:57,885 --> 00:18:00,285
five 5,000 yen bills.

322
00:18:00,285 --> 00:18:03,085
And of all things, there were forty-seven 1,000 yen bills.

323
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:04,885
Don't you think that's weird?

324
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:06,285
True.

325
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,385
Uh, excuse me.

326
00:18:08,385 --> 00:18:09,785
If it's okay with you,

327
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:13,685
could you please show me the things that were in his pocket?

328
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:16,285
You want to see them too, don't you, Pops?

329
00:18:16,285 --> 00:18:18,085
Yeah, I guess so.

330
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:20,385
Well, go ahead.

331
00:18:20,385 --> 00:18:23,785
I'm sorry to trouble you, Inspector.

332
00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:30,885
So, this is all of it.

333
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:34,185
He had this many things inside his pocket?

334
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:35,485
Yeah.

335
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:37,285
Since Officer Takagi is checking

336
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:41,185
on the key of the locker in question just yet, it isn't here.

337
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:44,385
Come to think of it, Ms. Kashizuka.

338
00:18:44,385 --> 00:18:45,385
Yes?

339
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:47,685
Out of the two towels that were found

340
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:49,385
by the feet of the dead body in the toilet,

341
00:18:49,385 --> 00:18:52,985
the tip of one of them seem to have been wet.

342
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:54,885
Do you know why?

343
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:58,085
I have no idea. I was scared

344
00:18:58,085 --> 00:18:59,985
and looking down all the while, you see.

345
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:03,585
And as to the boot that was under the towel,

346
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:06,585
there was a knot at the tip of the shoelace of the boot,

347
00:19:06,585 --> 00:19:08,885
and it was hooked onto the boot.

348
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:13,585
Oh, that's my habit since I was a child.

349
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,985
When washing cloth sneakers, and drying them,

350
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:18,085
if the strings are knotted that way,

351
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:20,685
my brother used to tell me they'd be easier to hang.

352
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:25,185
Of course I don't wash boots, but I still have that habit.

353
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:29,085
And, my brother's not here anymore either.

354
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:35,085
Inspector. Shall we call it a day?

355
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:37,485
After all, it hasn't been long since she's lost her older brother, besides,

356
00:19:37,485 --> 00:19:41,685
a man she doesn't even know committed suicide right before her eyes.

357
00:19:42,985 --> 00:19:46,685
Okay then, I would like you to come in for interrogation tomorrow,

358
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,885
so would you please leave your contact number and address behind?

359
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:53,585
Yes, sir. I'll write it on something.

360
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:57,585
If possible I would like you to show me some sort of identification.

361
00:19:57,585 --> 00:20:00,485
Since I'm a new college grad and in the process of looking for a job,

362
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:02,185
I don't have a name card.

363
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:05,185
But if I go home, I have my health insurance card.

364
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:07,585
Okay, will you bring it with you tomorrow, then?

365
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:09,085
All right.

366
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:13,485
Uh, if you're going home, shall I give you a lift?

367
00:20:13,485 --> 00:20:16,185
My car is parked at a parking lot nearby.

368
00:20:16,185 --> 00:20:18,785
Maybe that man's friends

369
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:22,485
could be ambushing you near your house too.

370
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:24,485
Thank you so much.

371
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:27,885
No problem, no need to thank me.

372
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:31,785
By the way, why is he here?

373
00:20:31,785 --> 00:20:36,185
Well, Amuro here has become my first disciple, you see!

374
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:38,485
Disciple?

375
00:20:40,485 --> 00:20:41,485
I tell you, really.

376
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:46,185
You mean another detective's been added around you again.

377
00:20:46,185 --> 00:20:47,885
Again?

378
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:51,385
Yeah. There are others besides you.

379
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:53,185
A young woman detective

380
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,185
who's been going around the crime scenes together

381
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:58,685
with Mr. Mouri recently.

382
00:20:58,685 --> 00:21:01,685
A young woman detective.

383
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:06,585
I would really like to see her.

384
00:22:29,385 --> 00:22:32,685
Ms. Kashizuka, is this the road?

385
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,085
Yes.

386
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:36,185
Come to think of it.

387
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:39,285
This car is the same as Officer Sato's, except a different color, isn't it?

388
00:22:39,285 --> 00:22:42,185
By the way, why are you guys riding together?

389
00:22:42,185 --> 00:22:43,585
It's cramped in here!

390
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:44,985
I'm sorry.

391
00:22:44,985 --> 00:22:48,785
This car isn't made to seat 3 people in the backseat, you see.

392
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,885
It's okay.

393
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:53,685
Why are you riding with us, Dad?

394
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:56,385
I was worried about Ms. Kei, that's why.

395
00:22:56,385 --> 00:22:58,685
I don't feel comfortable staying back at the agency with Conan,

396
00:22:58,685 --> 00:23:00,985
where a person just committed suicide.

397
00:23:00,985 --> 00:23:04,285
Then, why didn't you go over to Eri's?

398
00:23:04,285 --> 00:23:05,285
Come of it!

399
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:08,385
You came along just because Ms. Kashizuka is pretty!

400
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:11,285
That man.

401
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:13,785
I wonder if he really committed suicide.

402
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:17,185
But, there seems to have been no gun discharge residue

403
00:23:17,185 --> 00:23:21,885
detected from Ms. Kashizuka's body

404
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:25,085
and what's even stranger is his cell phone.

405
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:27,085
Why was everything, except the mail that was sent to Pops

406
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:31,385
the received or sent history, including the address book all blank?

407
00:23:31,385 --> 00:23:33,385
Besides, the things that were left back in his pocket

408
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:36,585
the loose change and bills that were in his wallet.

409
00:23:36,585 --> 00:23:41,685
Why did he have to carry around so many bills and change?

410
00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:45,085
One more thing.

411
00:23:45,085 --> 00:23:48,485
She's probably lying.

412
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:54,785
"Next Episode" -Please, I can't hold it anymore!

413
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:58,085
This smell...

414
00:23:58,085 --> 00:24:00,285
Don't tell me...

415
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:03,685
More than that, how about it? Fruit juice that I buy.

416
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:06,585
Yep. It's very good.

417
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,785
Are you coming too, Masumi?

418
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,085
Yeah.

419
00:24:16,785 --> 00:24:18,185
Next Conan,

420
00:24:18,185 --> 00:24:22,285
"The Nocturne of the Detectives (Kidnap)"
