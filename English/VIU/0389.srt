1
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,779
Deduction in Sakurajima!

2
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,679
Hand-made liquor brings about a sad result.

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,779
Pops is drunk but the case is solved!

4
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,179
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,979
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,180
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54,696 --> 00:01:58,695
We accompanied Pops and came to Kagoshima,

8
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:02,496
and visited the Takakuma Brewery, the maker of distilled spirits.

9
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:08,195
The crime occurred just as we were enjoying going sightseeing

10
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:11,196
guided by Fumiko, the wife of the president of the brewery.

11
00:02:12,996 --> 00:02:15,295
The managing director Shinsuke Tatsumura

12
00:02:15,296 --> 00:02:18,195
is taken away from his home by someone.

13
00:02:18,196 --> 00:02:20,095
Two days later,

14
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:21,296
his dead body is found!

15
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:24,996
What? The killer is among us?

16
00:02:27,296 --> 00:02:31,195
We can't find anybody who had a grudge against Mr. Tatsumura

17
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:34,595
other than the people of this brewery.

18
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:36,695
I'll bet Mrs. Shiraishi is in agony,

19
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:39,396
being that everyone close to her is being suspected.

20
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:44,095
But...

21
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:48,196
I'm sure the killer is among the people here.

22
00:02:51,396 --> 00:02:56,396
"Kogoro Drunk Over Satsuma (Part 2)"

23
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:03,695
How was it, after listening to each one's story?

24
00:03:03,696 --> 00:03:05,195
Nothing gained.

25
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:08,195
Everyone has a motive and each person's alibi is not definite...

26
00:03:08,196 --> 00:03:10,995
And yet, we don't have enough to go on to arrest anyone either.

27
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:13,496
Don't you? There are two things to go on...

28
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:16,895
Why did the killer go trough the trouble

29
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,995
of taking his corpse out of the house.

30
00:03:19,996 --> 00:03:22,195
Moreover, why did the killer notify the police

31
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:24,295
of his whereabouts two days later?

32
00:03:24,296 --> 00:03:26,895
If only both mysteries can be figured out...

33
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:28,395
Dad!

34
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:31,195
That's for being sassy saying something so obvious.

35
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:33,796
Why don't you hurry up and solve the mystery then?

36
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:37,095
Mr. Mouri, you're going to ask us questions again.

37
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:38,395
"Satoshi Shiraishi (30)" -tomorrow, aren't you?

38
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:40,195
"Takakuma Brewery Owner" -Yes, from morning...

39
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:41,995
If it's okay with you, please spend the night at our home.

40
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:44,195
Ms. Maezono says she'll do so

41
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:46,195
because going back and forth is too much trouble.

42
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:48,495
That'll be a great help. I'd sure love to...

43
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:49,595
Okay.

44
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,595
He's not the killer.

45
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:54,995
If he were, he wouldn't let a detective spend the night at his house.

46
00:03:54,996 --> 00:03:56,795
The ones who look most unsuspicious

47
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:58,895
are the ones who are most suspicious.

48
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:01,596
Talk about suspecting anything and everything.

49
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:04,495
This is no laughing matter,

50
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:06,396
I don't have the slightest idea either.

51
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:13,895
"Takakuma Brewery."

52
00:04:13,896 --> 00:04:15,695
Two mysteries...

53
00:04:15,696 --> 00:04:18,095
I'm sure there is an answer...

54
00:04:18,096 --> 00:04:20,996
a reason why the killer had to do both.

55
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,895
Good morning!

56
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:26,295
Good morning.

57
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:29,395
It seems that everyone is already here and working.

58
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:33,895
I see. Making sake starts from early in the morning.

59
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:35,995
My husband gets up at 04:30 am

60
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:37,795
and goes into the storeroom at 05:00 am.

61
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:40,495
It sure is hard work.

62
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:43,195
Sake is a "living creature."

63
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:45,095
Once you start preparing it,

64
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:47,895
you cannot take your eyes off it.

65
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:49,395
"Fumiko Shiraishi (27)" -That's why you can't do something.

66
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:52,095
"Satoshi's wife" -like leave the brewery to go kill someone.

67
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:54,795
You can't do something like that, can you?

68
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:56,595
I came to tell you that breakfast is ready.

69
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,395
-Thank you. -Thank you.

70
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:00,395
Anytime you're ready is fine.

71
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:04,895
"The workers who love sake making would never leave the brewery."

72
00:05:04,896 --> 00:05:06,496
If that's true...

73
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:12,895
Dad, what're you laughing about?

74
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,995
I figured out the mystery, both of them.

75
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:17,895
Really?

76
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:21,296
The killer is Hitomi Maezono!

77
00:05:23,996 --> 00:05:26,295
Why do you say it's her?

78
00:05:26,296 --> 00:05:29,396
"Hitomi Maezono (25)" -Because she's the only woman among the suspects.

79
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,095
The first mystery,

80
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:36,795
why did she go through the trouble of carrying the corpse out of the house?

81
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:39,595
Mr. Tatsumura is has a stout physique,

82
00:05:39,596 --> 00:05:43,795
so everybody would think that it is impossible for a woman to carry him.

83
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:44,995
That is, it would make people think

84
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:46,595
that a woman couldn't possibly be the killer.

85
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,896
It was a scheme to deceive others.

86
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:52,695
Then, what about the second mystery?

87
00:05:52,696 --> 00:05:55,795
"Why did she notify the police of his whereabouts?"

88
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:57,295
Why else?

89
00:05:57,296 --> 00:06:00,195
She wanted the dead to rest in peace as soon as possible.

90
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:02,795
Her kind womanly side took over.

91
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:06,796
Therefore, the killer is none other than and can only be Hitomi Maezono.

92
00:06:10,896 --> 00:06:13,095
I wish Officer Shinfuku would hurry over here.

93
00:06:13,096 --> 00:06:16,395
-I'll let him in on my perfect deduction... -But, Pops...

94
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:19,195
-What? -You said it's impossible for a woman to carry him,

95
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:21,696
and yet Ms. Maezono did so?

96
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:25,495
If it's impossible, I don't think she can.

97
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:31,595
Well, that's, you see, she may not look it but she's extremely strong.

98
00:06:31,596 --> 00:06:34,296
I'm sure she's lifting weights or something.

99
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,596
Go take a peek in her room.

100
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:44,595
I'm sure she's got a super muscular body.

101
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:45,795
Don't worry, even if you take a peek,

102
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:47,695
since you're a child, she'll overlook it.

103
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:50,295
No darn way!

104
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:52,895
Help me out at work a little, kid!

105
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:55,395
Come on, how can you even think of making a child take a peek!

106
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:59,196
No, well, I'm talking in terms of pure detective work.

107
00:07:00,196 --> 00:07:01,796
Give me a break.

108
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:04,595
"Seiichi Orita (60)" -No, it's not that I'm slacking off.

109
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:07,395
I'm taking a break, because we're changing shifts.

110
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:10,396
At this age we can't help but get exhausted.

111
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:14,796
How nostalgic thinking about times back then.

112
00:07:17,996 --> 00:07:19,395
Is that you, sir?

113
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:21,195
20 years ago.

114
00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:22,795
With Mr. Tatsumura,

115
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:24,295
and the person in the middle is the previous president,

116
00:07:24,296 --> 00:07:26,195
who died last year.

117
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,295
And who are those children?

118
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:30,395
The current president.

119
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:32,795
He has a younger sister.

120
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:36,995
She's not his younger sister, but it's Fumiko, the president's wife.

121
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:38,795
They were childhood friends.

122
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:42,195
See, this guy next to me is her Dad.

123
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:45,196
We used to work here together.

124
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:54,595
The previous president only had one son.

125
00:07:54,596 --> 00:07:58,596
So, he took care of her as if she were his own daughter.

126
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:03,595
Fumiko's father was also a very experienced worker

127
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:05,995
but poor thing, he died of an illness

128
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:08,096
soon after Fumiko entered junior high school.

129
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:14,195
But the previous president was not one to abandon the bereaved family.

130
00:08:14,196 --> 00:08:17,495
He encouraged them and continued to help them out making a living.

131
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,995
He made sure Fumiko graduated from college.

132
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:22,695
He even helped her go through nursing school.

133
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:24,795
The previous president was a life-saver

134
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,496
for Fumiko and her mother, wasn't he?

135
00:08:27,496 --> 00:08:29,195
Come to think of it...

136
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:35,095
Weren't you a nurse at the Chuo Hospital before?

137
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:37,995
Yes. I was, until 5 years ago when I got married.

138
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:40,295
She used to be a nurse before, right?

139
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:42,295
Yes. That's why she used her connections of the past

140
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:45,895
to get the managing director Tatsumura an appointment at Chuo Hospital.

141
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:47,095
An appointment?

142
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:49,595
For a physical exam.

143
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,895
He mentioned something like that the other day.

144
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:54,595
I'm so sorry that I'm late.

145
00:08:54,596 --> 00:09:00,395
You see, the physical exam took longer than I expected...

146
00:09:00,396 --> 00:09:02,895
If she knew the day before that something like that would happen to him,

147
00:09:02,896 --> 00:09:05,795
I think Fumiko wouldn't have recommended him to get a physical.

148
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,095
You mean Mrs. Shiraishi is the one who recommended

149
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:09,395
the physical exam to Mr. Tatsumura?

150
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:12,095
There is a physical exam every year,

151
00:09:12,096 --> 00:09:15,195
but the managing director never underwent one.

152
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:18,295
However, she kept insisting he get one because he was working too hard.

153
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:21,795
And, he was murdered the following day.

154
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:24,195
A physical exam?

155
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,295
Don't tell me that?

156
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:27,295
Is anything the matter?

157
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:28,296
No, not really.

158
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:30,595
Okay, I guess I'll go back to work then.

159
00:09:30,596 --> 00:09:34,595
I need to get things done before the police come and questioning me again.

160
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:35,896
See you, sonny.

161
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:39,995
It's not impossible.

162
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,695
Rather, if that method was used,

163
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:45,395
the two mysteries will also be solved.

164
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:46,896
But, I have no proof.

165
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:50,295
Sakurajima.

166
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:52,095
If I remember correctly, back then...

167
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:53,096
That's right!

168
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:54,096
"Kagoshima North Police Station."

169
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:55,395
Mr. Mouri.

170
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:58,196
I was just thinking of heading that way...

171
00:09:59,396 --> 00:10:02,195
I have a favor to ask you before you do...

172
00:10:02,196 --> 00:10:06,095
Yes, I would like you to check Mr. Tatsumura's corpse for me.

173
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:08,796
No, what I want to know is whether on the clothes he was wearing...

174
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:17,095
Come on, show your super muscle physique!

175
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:18,695
Just what do you think you're looking at?

176
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:20,595
Officer Shinfuku and the others have arrived!

177
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:21,596
Yes, ma'am!

178
00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:25,095
Goodness.

179
00:10:25,096 --> 00:10:26,795
Getting right to the point,

180
00:10:26,796 --> 00:10:29,495
the stuff was not found on his clothes at all.

181
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:30,596
What's this about?

182
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:34,195
All right. This is it...

183
00:10:34,196 --> 00:10:36,795
You know, what you asked us to do a while ago...

184
00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:40,195
Oh, no, Dad. You mean you asked a favor and forgot what you asked?

185
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:45,595
Oh, that stuff. Oh, so nothing was on at all...

186
00:10:45,596 --> 00:10:48,095
He's really good at playing along.

187
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:49,495
And, who is it?

188
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:50,795
Who is what?

189
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:52,795
Didn't you say that you knew on the phone?

190
00:10:52,796 --> 00:10:55,995
And you said you would reveal who the perpetrator when we are here.

191
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:57,795
Who is the killer?

192
00:10:57,796 --> 00:10:59,695
Did you really say something like that?

193
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:00,996
I feel like I sort of did.

194
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:04,195
You see, the killer is...

195
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,495
a woman.

196
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:06,895
-Hitomi Maezono. -Hitomi Maezono.

197
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:08,095
Dad!

198
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:10,095
My reason for coming to that conclusion is...

199
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:13,295
Pops, this is your chance to show everyone your real ability.

200
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:14,396
I guess so.

201
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:28,295
This Managing Director Tatsumura's homicide case...

202
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:30,696
Who is the killer?

203
00:11:31,796 --> 00:11:33,295
The real killer is...

204
00:11:33,296 --> 00:11:34,896
Sakurajima?

205
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:40,495
Is something wrong with the mountain?

206
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:42,096
No, nothing in particular.

207
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:50,896
Officer Shinfuku!

208
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:56,396
Is this the famous Sleeping Kogoro?

209
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:06,014
What is it, Conan?

210
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,714
He's gone. Conan?

211
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:13,814
He probably went outside thinking that Sakurajima erupted or something.

212
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:17,414
Mr. Orita, this is the famous Sleeping Kogoro.

213
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:19,714
Excuse me, I'd like to take a picture.

214
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:21,014
Quiet!

215
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:23,614
In preparation for killing Mr. Tatsumura,

216
00:12:23,615 --> 00:12:26,115
the killer also schemed an alibi trick.

217
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:31,914
-Alibi trick? -Alibi trick?

218
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:34,514
I had an idea of what the trick is,

219
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:37,014
but I needed proof.

220
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:39,714
And that's why I asked you to do me that favor.

221
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:41,814
The "ashes" of Sakurajima, you mean?

222
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:45,115
Yes, if there was any found on the clothes Mr. Tatsumura was wearing...

223
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:48,814
There was none whatsoever on his clothes.

224
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:50,014
However, I already checked

225
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:54,214
with the Kagoshima District Weather Station a while ago

226
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:55,614
and found that on the day of the incident,

227
00:12:55,615 --> 00:12:58,914
in the Kagoshima city area where Mr. Tatsumura's house is,

228
00:12:58,915 --> 00:13:01,314
ashes were falling all the way through,

229
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:03,415
from around noon to midnight.

230
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:09,314
Doesn't something feel sandy?

231
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:10,414
Now that you mentioned it...

232
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,715
It's probably the ashes.

233
00:13:13,715 --> 00:13:16,114
Yes, ashes were falling back then.

234
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:17,814
Isn't it odd?

235
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:21,614
We arrived at his house at 6:00 in the evening.

236
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:27,214
If Mr. Tatsumura was killed and carried out just about that time,

237
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:31,615
it's only natural that ashes would have been on his clothes too.

238
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:38,214
But, there were no ashes on his clothes at all.

239
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:43,514
In other words, Mr. Tatsumura did not leave home at 6:00 sundown,

240
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:45,414
but before the ashes came falling

241
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:48,014
that is some time in the morning.

242
00:13:48,015 --> 00:13:49,414
I see.

243
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:51,314
No, but then...

244
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:53,215
Yes, there's a discrepancy.

245
00:13:57,015 --> 00:13:58,115
It's blood.

246
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:04,515
I wonder what that blood stain was, Mrs. Shiraishi.

247
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,214
I was mistaken about one thing.

248
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:18,614
The reason you went out of your way, that day to take us sightseeing...

249
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:21,514
I thought it was because Mr. Tatsumura asked me

250
00:14:21,515 --> 00:14:24,414
to pose for advertisement of your product...

251
00:14:24,415 --> 00:14:29,914
Mr. Mouri, please refuse what Mr. Tatsuma asked you to do yesterday.

252
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:31,114
I thought that you showed us around

253
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:32,715
because you wanted me to refuse his offer.

254
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:35,014
It wasn't?

255
00:14:35,015 --> 00:14:38,114
You did so to establish your alibi

256
00:14:38,115 --> 00:14:42,614
and to set us up as witnesses to testify that Mr. Tatsumura was killed

257
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:46,815
just before we arrived at his house.

258
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:49,514
Am I not right,

259
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:50,715
Mrs. Shiraishi.

260
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:53,415
No way...

261
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:56,514
Mr. Mouri.

262
00:14:56,515 --> 00:14:59,614
I said a while ago that the real killer is a woman.

263
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:02,415
-A woman... -You're referring to Ms. Maezono?

264
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:07,115
I'm talking about Mrs. Fumiko Shiraishi.

265
00:15:09,815 --> 00:15:12,614
You offered from your side to take us sightseeing.

266
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:14,414
That morning you...

267
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:18,915
made up some excuse and summoned Mr. Tatsumura out to the park.

268
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:24,015
Mrs. Shiraishi.

269
00:15:26,215 --> 00:15:27,215
Mrs. Shiraishi.

270
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:30,414
She probably said something like, "I'd like to talk to you,"

271
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:33,214
and made him get in the car once more

272
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:35,015
and put him to sleep...

273
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:38,814
Getting anesthesia ready

274
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:41,614
and getting blood samples were easy for you to do

275
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:44,714
for you were a nurse before.

276
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:47,714
Then, after that you came to pick us up at the hotel.

277
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:49,314
"Shiroyama Grand Hotel."

278
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,314
-Good morning. -Good morning.

279
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:53,714
Good morning.

280
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:57,414
You spent the whole day with us

281
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:00,715
and cleverly lead us to Mr. Tatsumura's house.

282
00:16:02,115 --> 00:16:03,514
It's open.

283
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:05,514
I'll go check inside.

284
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:08,015
Mr. Tatsumura, this is Fumiko.

285
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:13,415
And, you carried out what you schemed in the living room...

286
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,314
Mr. Mouri!

287
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,315
Mrs. Shiraishi!

288
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:27,614
What's the matter?

289
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:30,114
Out of the two mysteries one of them,

290
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,914
why did the killer go out of the way to carry the corpse out, rather...

291
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:35,314
you didn't carry him out.

292
00:16:35,315 --> 00:16:39,614
There was no corpse in that house to begin.

293
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:41,915
But the lights in the house were on, weren't they?

294
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:47,214
Before you came to pick us up,

295
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,514
you borrowed the keys from Mr. Tatsumura who was asleep

296
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:52,714
went into his house, turned on the lights

297
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:56,415
as well as unlock the front entrance door at that time.

298
00:16:58,215 --> 00:17:00,514
So, that's the story...

299
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:01,814
Hold on a second!

300
00:17:01,815 --> 00:17:04,414
Now for the second mystery...

301
00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:06,115
Wait, Wait a minute, I said.

302
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:12,214
What you're saying is strange. It's totally strange.

303
00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:14,814
You seem to want to insist that Fumiko is the killer,

304
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:18,814
but she was with you all day that day.

305
00:17:18,815 --> 00:17:21,514
There's no way she could've done it.

306
00:17:21,515 --> 00:17:24,115
When on earth could she have done it?

307
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:28,914
Right, Dad, when?

308
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,815
Right after the you know what, right Mrs. Shiraishi?

309
00:17:36,415 --> 00:17:39,914
I'm sorry to have gotten you involved in something bothersome like this.

310
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:42,914
After you dropped us off at the hotel...

311
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:44,915
That's when.

312
00:17:57,415 --> 00:17:59,314
You got a bronze statue

313
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:03,115
just like the one at Mr. Tatsumura's house beforehand.

314
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:26,215
In other words, this case occurred after the police began investigation.

315
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:29,514
It was a blind spot.

316
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:30,714
It can't be helped.

317
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:35,114
No one ordinarily checks for alibis after the investigation starts.

318
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:40,014
You tried to make us think that the estimated time of the murder

319
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:42,914
was just before we arrived at Mr. Tatsumura's residence.

320
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:46,314
Doing so would give you a perfect alibi.

321
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:50,015
Because after all you were with us right through.

322
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:52,314
The second mystery...

323
00:18:52,315 --> 00:18:54,414
Why did the killer notify the police

324
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:57,514
of the whereabouts of the corpse two days later?

325
00:18:57,515 --> 00:18:59,314
Two days having past,

326
00:18:59,315 --> 00:19:01,214
it's hard to determine an accurate estimate,

327
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:03,214
but there seems to be no doubt that the time of death

328
00:19:03,215 --> 00:19:04,414
is between sundown to night that day.

329
00:19:04,415 --> 00:19:06,414
If the corpse was discovered immediately,

330
00:19:06,415 --> 00:19:09,614
the estimated time of death would come out accurately.

331
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,914
On the other hand, if the corpse is left as is for many days,

332
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:13,814
it would be impossible to figure it out.

333
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:17,514
Either way, would make meaningless the alibi that is perfect.

334
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:22,214
That's why it was best for the corpse to be found two days later.

335
00:19:22,215 --> 00:19:25,814
Mr. Mouri, when and how did you figure out I committed the murder?

336
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:27,314
On the day before the incident,

337
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:32,014
you recommended Mr. Tatsumura to go get a physical exam, didn't you?

338
00:19:32,015 --> 00:19:33,514
That...

339
00:19:33,515 --> 00:19:35,014
What do you mean?

340
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:39,014
If you take a blood sample, the trace of the needle would be left behind,

341
00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:42,114
and that would bring about suspicion during the autopsy.

342
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:46,114
But, if he gets a physical the day before,

343
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:49,314
blood samples would naturally be taken.

344
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:52,014
In other words, she injected him in the exact same place

345
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:53,715
that he was injected the day before.

346
00:19:54,915 --> 00:19:56,214
I see.

347
00:19:56,215 --> 00:19:58,314
But, why...

348
00:19:58,315 --> 00:20:01,014
Why did you kill Mr. Tatsumura?

349
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:03,314
I was scared.

350
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:06,214
I thought that if he kept on staying at this brewery,

351
00:20:06,215 --> 00:20:09,514
one day someone would be influenced by him

352
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:11,414
and stop making sake the old way,

353
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:14,114
as a result dropping the quality of our sake.

354
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:16,014
That someone who was concerned only about making money

355
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,414
would one day come along.

356
00:20:18,415 --> 00:20:19,814
No way, Mrs. Shiraishi.

357
00:20:19,815 --> 00:20:22,614
Not among anyone of us, never!

358
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:24,114
Maybe now...

359
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:27,614
But, people change when various things happen.

360
00:20:27,615 --> 00:20:31,314
Mr. Tatsumura... changed too, didn't he?

361
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:34,014
I'm to blame. I'm... to blame for all this...

362
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:36,314
I should've fired him.

363
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:39,114
Not being able to get rid of somebody who saved the brewery

364
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:42,414
is one of your good points. It's okay.

365
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:45,415
But, why... why did you...

366
00:20:46,915 --> 00:20:49,414
I just wanted to look good.

367
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:53,114
I wanted to say, I'm the one who saved this brewery.

368
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:57,514
Of course she is not be forgiven for killing someone.

369
00:20:57,515 --> 00:21:04,014
But, she did what she did wanting to repay your father for his kindness.

370
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:06,314
To father...

371
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:08,614
One who never forgets a kindness received.

372
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:13,215
Your wife is just like you, a woman of Satsuma for sure.

373
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:19,415
Fumiko.

374
00:21:20,415 --> 00:21:22,115
Of course we're alike.

375
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,815
We're husband and wife.

376
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:38,214
Don't bother seeing me off.

377
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:40,714
You have to hurry back to the brewery.

378
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:42,214
Mrs. Shiraishi...

379
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:43,814
Fumiko...

380
00:21:43,815 --> 00:21:46,314
There are people throughout Japan

381
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:47,915
who are waiting for the sake that you make.

382
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:50,214
I'll wait for you too.

383
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:51,914
I'll wait till you come back

384
00:21:51,915 --> 00:21:53,715
while continuing to make genuine sake.

385
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:58,815
A case was thus, closed.

386
00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:36,214
They don't have it here after all, the Takakuma.

387
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,714
Takakuma, Takakuma...

388
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:40,415
Who cares, I'll just get anything that's around!

389
00:23:42,415 --> 00:23:44,914
You're still buying?

390
00:23:44,915 --> 00:23:48,215
It's more quantity than quality after all...

391
00:23:49,215 --> 00:23:51,815
Black vinegar is good for the health.

392
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:55,315
Like father like daughter, really...

393
00:23:57,515 --> 00:24:00,415
"Next Episode."

394
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:10,414
Good morning.

395
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,315
Is there anything on my face?

396
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:17,115
We saw a suspicious looking person on our way to school.

397
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:21,814
Officer Sato.

398
00:24:21,815 --> 00:24:23,314
Next Conan,

399
00:24:23,315 --> 00:24:27,515
"Love Story at Police Headquarters 6 (Part 1)"

400
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,814
Next Conan's Hint:

401
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:47,415
"The news."

402
00:24:48,215 --> 00:24:49,914
The next episode is Love Story 6?

403
00:24:49,915 --> 00:24:51,014
I think this will continue till the 100th episode.

404
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:52,415
I feel sorry for the two.
