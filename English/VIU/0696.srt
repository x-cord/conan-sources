1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:03,075
This way, this way!

2
00:00:03,075 --> 00:00:05,375
We've got a grave case!

3
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:08,275
We need your help, Detective Mouri!

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:09,475
I mean,

5
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:12,975
why do I have to keep kids company from so early in the morning.

6
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:15,375
You're the one who accepted the request, didn't you, Dad?

7
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:20,375
I didn't know that Yoko was going to be on this morning's Wide Show!

8
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,575
Everybody's so energetic from morning.

9
00:00:22,575 --> 00:00:24,175
You can say that again.

10
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:26,975
Aim for a 100% solution.

11
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:29,175
Clear all mysteries and codes.

12
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:30,875
In flower gardens usually seen at district centers.

13
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,875
A twisted trick of a person who plunges to death.

14
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,575
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:36,475
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:39,075
His name is Detective Conan.

17
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:25,467
"Flower Garden Vandalism Conspiracy"

18
00:02:27,954 --> 00:02:30,654
Beikacho district center?

19
00:02:30,654 --> 00:02:34,054
Yeah, it's a facility where the local people can enjoy sports

20
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:37,354
or spend their time freely doing what they want.

21
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:40,554
At any rate, I don't smell anything fishy here.

22
00:02:41,554 --> 00:02:43,254
Over here!

23
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:44,754
"Children's Flowerbed"

24
00:02:47,854 --> 00:02:49,154
Isn't this terrible?

25
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:53,054
It's all messed up like a whirlwind went by or something!

26
00:02:53,054 --> 00:02:56,354
The children all take care of this flower garden

27
00:02:56,354 --> 00:03:00,854
from giving water to growing the flowers and plants.

28
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:04,654
And yet now days every morning it's always messed up like this.

29
00:03:04,654 --> 00:03:06,754
Talk about nasty!

30
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:09,054
So, Mr. Mouri, please catch the culprit.

31
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:12,454
Discuss it with your teacher or mother.

32
00:03:12,454 --> 00:03:13,854
Dad!

33
00:03:13,854 --> 00:03:17,254
So, I guess it's impossible to ask Detective Mouri

34
00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:18,454
to handle this case after all.

35
00:03:18,454 --> 00:03:22,554
And yet, when we called him a while ago, he said, "Leave it to me".

36
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:23,854
Right, Genta?

37
00:03:23,854 --> 00:03:25,754
What's the matter?

38
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:28,354
Strange.

39
00:03:28,354 --> 00:03:29,654
What's wrong?

40
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:32,454
The brick that I made is gone.

41
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:35,554
It was around here somewhere before.

42
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:37,554
Maybe the one who vandalized this garden,

43
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:39,254
carelessly stepped on it or something and cracked it?

44
00:03:39,254 --> 00:03:41,654
Darn! What a rat!

45
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,754
Let's nab the one who's messing up the flower garden with our own hands!

46
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:46,554
Let's catch him!

47
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:47,654
Yes!

48
00:03:47,654 --> 00:03:49,654
No, children can't possibly handle it alone.

49
00:03:49,654 --> 00:03:51,954
The one who's messing up the flower garden is doing so at night,

50
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:53,654
so there has to be an adult around.

51
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:58,454
Come on, Dad! Promise made is to be kept!

52
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:02,054
So, here comes the great detective.

53
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:05,054
I'm in no mood to babysit.

54
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:07,954
You've all come?

55
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:14,154
Who's that beauty?

56
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:18,154
Good morning, Ms. Yamazaki and Saki!

57
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:19,254
"Toshiko Yamazaki (43), Town Centre Staff Member"

58
00:04:19,254 --> 00:04:22,854
It sure is upsetting to see it messed up like this every morning.

59
00:04:22,854 --> 00:04:25,954
Are you an employee at this center, Miss?

60
00:04:25,954 --> 00:04:29,654
"Saki Okamura (24), Town Centre Staff Member" -Yes, and who are you?

61
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:33,354
Yes, I am the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri,

62
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:36,754
who has been asked to investigate the flower garden vandalism.

63
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,954
You're a detective?

64
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:40,954
Hey! Stop dilly-dallying

65
00:04:40,954 --> 00:04:43,054
and hurry up and clean up!

66
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:44,254
Yes, ma'am!

67
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:45,954
If you will excuse me.

68
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:52,654
Thank you for your patronage.

69
00:04:52,654 --> 00:04:55,454
Oh. You're doing it all wrong.

70
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:57,654
"Ryunosuke Okuda (57)" -When amateurs do the flower garden,

71
00:04:57,654 --> 00:04:59,454
"Flower Shop Owner" -they really spoil it.

72
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:01,154
We did ask you to deliver things,

73
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:03,754
but we never asked you to put in your two cents!

74
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:06,154
I wish you would leave fixing the garden to we professionals.

75
00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:08,454
I'll keep the price down.

76
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:12,454
Young plants, fertilizers and the manual labor

77
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:14,354
it takes for fixing up, everything included.

78
00:05:14,354 --> 00:05:16,654
I said, we don't need your two cents talk.

79
00:05:16,654 --> 00:05:17,754
I tell you, people are all only interested

80
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:21,154
in ripping money off from each other.

81
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,154
People are all?

82
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:26,954
Then, with discount and all, how's this?

83
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:31,054
I'm sorry, as you can see, Ms. Yamazaki isn't interested.

84
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:32,954
You stay out of it!

85
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:35,554
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

86
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:39,354
Shut up! This property was originally mine,

87
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:41,354
so it's up to me what I want to do with it!

88
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:43,854
Miss, are you all right?

89
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:46,554
Yes, I'm fine.

90
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,954
I, the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri,

91
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:51,154
won't let anyone who gets violent

92
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:52,954
with beautiful ladies get away with it.

93
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:55,554
A detective?

94
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:04,254
So then, the one who's messing up the flower garden

95
00:06:04,254 --> 00:06:06,654
does so between the time

96
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:08,954
after the employees leave at sundown and the following morning.

97
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:11,354
Since when has this started happening?

98
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:12,954
It's the 3rd day already.

99
00:06:12,954 --> 00:06:16,254
I'm sorry, I'm so busy in the morning.

100
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:18,754
So, that's it for playing detective!

101
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,054
By the way,

102
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:24,054
do you know of anyone who may want to harass the district center?

103
00:06:24,054 --> 00:06:26,054
Maybe just one.

104
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:29,354
Oh, you mean him?

105
00:06:32,254 --> 00:06:36,154
Go! It's time for children to go to school!

106
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:37,154
"Workshop"

107
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:40,254
The brick of the flower garden. Did you make it here?

108
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:44,254
Yes. Each is of different size and shape

109
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:47,654
because the children all baked it themselves.

110
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:49,154
The one who's messing up the flower garden

111
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:52,754
is stomping all over the hearts of the children.

112
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:53,754
I'm sure that the culprit will come

113
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:55,354
and mess up the flower garden tonight again.

114
00:06:55,354 --> 00:06:58,254
What happens three times will happen for the fourth time!

115
00:06:58,254 --> 00:07:00,754
Let's go on night patrol with Mr. Mouri

116
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,554
and nab the culprit!

117
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:10,154
They're really all out to go for it.

118
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:12,154
I see, is that right?

119
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:14,354
Your parents run a cafe.

120
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:17,254
I pass by that area a lot too.

121
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:19,254
Please do stop by one day.

122
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:21,154
I can at least serve you beer.

123
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:22,554
Really?

124
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:25,454
Why should it be one day? I'll go tonight!

125
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:26,554
Tonight?

126
00:07:26,554 --> 00:07:29,054
Geez, cut out the intimate act!

127
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:31,654
Uncle Kogoro.

128
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:33,854
We want to go on night patrol

129
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,754
to catch the one who's messing up the flower garden.

130
00:07:36,754 --> 00:07:38,254
Is 20:00 okay?

131
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:40,954
Okay, okay.

132
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:43,954
You're really reliable, aren't you?

133
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:45,854
Yes, I am, as you can see.

134
00:07:45,854 --> 00:07:48,154
I guess it's embedded in the character of a detective

135
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:50,454
to punish the strong and help the weak.

136
00:07:53,654 --> 00:07:58,054
Come on, you people, I shall see you to school!

137
00:07:58,054 --> 00:08:00,354
I'll be waiting for you tonight then.

138
00:08:01,354 --> 00:08:02,654
That's right.

139
00:08:02,654 --> 00:08:04,754
Wait a minute, Ayumi.

140
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:06,554
Here, it's for you.

141
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:08,654
It's what I promised to give you last time.

142
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,454
It blooms at night. I took it from my garden.

143
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:15,354
Wow, super. Thank you very much.

144
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:18,554
I've got one more, so here's one for you too.

145
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:20,554
Thank you very much.

146
00:08:25,654 --> 00:08:27,554
Here's another serving.

147
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:30,554
Thank you, Saki.

148
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:32,754
Welcome.

149
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:34,154
My.

150
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:38,254
You're...

151
00:08:38,254 --> 00:08:40,254
Since my mother's taking a trip now,

152
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:42,154
I'm part-timing here at night.

153
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,354
This is a nice shop.

154
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:46,654
It's your parent's home.

155
00:08:46,654 --> 00:08:50,554
Yes, they live on the 2nd floor up.

156
00:08:50,554 --> 00:08:52,154
Would you like something to drink?

157
00:08:52,154 --> 00:08:56,154
Thank you, but I'm sorry, we just came to get Dad.

158
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:59,854
You promised Ayumi and the others at 20:00, don't you, Dad?

159
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:03,454
How can I go home without drinking Saki's beer!

160
00:09:03,454 --> 00:09:06,154
He's not going to budge an inch.

161
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:10,354
I'm sorry, I made him drink so much.

162
00:09:10,354 --> 00:09:12,554
Geez.

163
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,254
We're late because of Pops.

164
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:22,354
It's already 22:00. Maybe the culprit's left already.

165
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:25,754
I wonder if the children's flower garden is okay?

166
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:29,654
The flowers.

167
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,154
What's the matter?

168
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:42,754
She is employee, Ms. Yamazaki.

169
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:45,454
Ran, call the ambulance and the police!

170
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:46,954
Okay!

171
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:52,254
Conan, look at that.

172
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:57,754
This flower petal.

173
00:09:57,754 --> 00:10:00,654
Pops! Somebody fled!

174
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:03,954
You're not getting away!

175
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:15,754
Caught him...

176
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:16,954
It's him!

177
00:10:16,954 --> 00:10:19,154
He is from the flower shop!

178
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:30,563
The victim is an employee of the district center, Ms. Toshiko Yamazaki.

179
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,463
The estimated time of death is around 20:00.

180
00:10:34,463 --> 00:10:37,163
Although she had bruises all over her body, the direct cause of death

181
00:10:37,163 --> 00:10:41,863
seems to be the impact of hitting her head on the brick.

182
00:10:41,863 --> 00:10:45,663
The wound on her head matched the brick that was beside her.

183
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:47,763
The brick is said to be one that the children baked on their own

184
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:49,763
and can only be found here.

185
00:10:49,763 --> 00:10:51,163
The person who found the body was...

186
00:10:51,163 --> 00:10:54,463
Children shouldn't be walking around so late at night like this.

187
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:56,663
We were going after the one who was messing up the flower garden!

188
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:59,563
Mr. Mouri, chaperoned us!

189
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:01,963
Okay, okay.

190
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:04,263
And, who is he?

191
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,963
He's Mr. Okuda who owns a flower shop nearby.

192
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:10,963
When the body was found, he was hiding, then fled,

193
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,663
so we nabbed him.

194
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:17,763
That man hates our district center.

195
00:11:17,763 --> 00:11:18,763
You are?

196
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:21,363
A colleague of Ms. Yamazaki who passed away.

197
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:26,063
That man used to be a florist here until a year ago,

198
00:11:26,063 --> 00:11:29,063
but he evicted when the district center was built.

199
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,763
He still has a grudge against that even now

200
00:11:30,763 --> 00:11:32,763
and comes to mess the flower garden up every night.

201
00:11:32,763 --> 00:11:35,663
Right. Since my shop was forced out of here,

202
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:38,263
my business stopped going well.

203
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:40,763
It's only natural that I get pissed, right?

204
00:11:40,763 --> 00:11:43,763
I did mess the flower garden up.

205
00:11:43,763 --> 00:11:47,863
But, when I came today, the flower garden was already a mess,

206
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:50,263
and that woman was lying on the ground.

207
00:11:51,263 --> 00:11:53,463
Inspector!

208
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,063
From the circumstances, Ms. Yamazaki probably

209
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:59,863
fell from around there of the emergency stairs.

210
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:02,363
Yes. According to forensics,

211
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:04,963
on the 3rd floor landing of the emergency stairs

212
00:12:04,963 --> 00:12:07,963
there were traces of struggle seen from the shoe prints

213
00:12:07,963 --> 00:12:11,163
of Ms. Yamazaki and Mr. Okuda's gardening boots.

214
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,063
I got it, Inspector.

215
00:12:13,063 --> 00:12:15,363
In other words, at 20:00.

216
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:19,363
Mr. Okuda at that landing, got into an argument with Ms. Yamazaki

217
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,263
and after struggling with each other, pushed her off.

218
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:24,663
At that time, he was scared and fled,

219
00:12:24,663 --> 00:12:27,863
but came back around 22:00 to check things out

220
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:31,463
and ran into us who came on night patrol.

221
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:32,563
No!

222
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:36,363
That's the only place in the center where smoking is allowed,

223
00:12:36,363 --> 00:12:38,763
so I took a puff there when I arrived in the morning.

224
00:12:38,763 --> 00:12:41,363
Then, that woman came to chase me out,

225
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:44,363
and we got into a small brawl.

226
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,263
And? How about 20:00?

227
00:12:47,263 --> 00:12:50,763
Could you tell me where and what you were doing?

228
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:54,063
At that time, I went to deliver bouquets,

229
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:57,463
but maybe it was a prank. The address wasn't correct.

230
00:12:57,463 --> 00:13:00,163
I was driving around the night road on my compact truck.

231
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:01,763
Was anybody with you

232
00:13:01,763 --> 00:13:03,363
or can somebody verify that for you?

233
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:04,463
No.

234
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:07,663
I see, so you have no alibi.

235
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:10,263
At any rate, please come to the station.

236
00:13:10,263 --> 00:13:11,263
Hey!

237
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:12,763
Yes, sir!

238
00:13:13,763 --> 00:13:18,063
I didn't do anything. It's some kind of mistake!

239
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,663
But,

240
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:23,663
what on earth did Ms. Yamazaki come to do here at 8:00 at night?

241
00:13:23,663 --> 00:13:27,963
I think Ms. Yamazaki came to look for this.

242
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:29,863
I'm in charge of accounting,

243
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:32,263
but the books didn't balance out lately.

244
00:13:32,263 --> 00:13:34,863
It seems the operating fees are being embezzled.

245
00:13:34,863 --> 00:13:35,963
Embezzled?

246
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:37,063
Yes.

247
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:39,863
Ms. Yamazaki is probably the one who embezzled he money.

248
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:41,463
I think she realized that I was checking into it

249
00:13:41,463 --> 00:13:44,863
and came to the center at night to hide the evidence.

250
00:13:44,863 --> 00:13:47,863
But, I hid the accounting books, so...

251
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:51,063
I see! So, she ran into Mr. Okuda then,

252
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,863
and was pushed off from the emergency stairs, eh?

253
00:13:54,863 --> 00:13:56,763
The story fits right in.

254
00:13:56,763 --> 00:13:58,363
Just as expected of the famed detective.

255
00:13:58,363 --> 00:13:59,963
What a wonderful deduction.

256
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:03,563
Well, I can do this hands down.

257
00:14:08,563 --> 00:14:12,563
It seems you're not convinced about the suspect being arrested.

258
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:14,263
Look.

259
00:14:15,763 --> 00:14:17,563
What's that line?

260
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:20,063
It looks like a string or something was dragged along.

261
00:14:20,063 --> 00:14:22,663
Ms. Yamazaki's shoestring probably came off

262
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:25,163
when they got into a struggle.

263
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:27,063
But, isn't that strange?

264
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:31,263
Yeah. The shoestring of the corpse was tied nicely.

265
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:34,563
Which means...

266
00:14:37,863 --> 00:14:39,463
Officer Takagi.

267
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:42,963
What about the flower petal that was on the clothes of the corpse?

268
00:14:42,963 --> 00:14:44,963
You mean this?

269
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:47,163
She fell onto the flower garden after all, you see.

270
00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:50,763
It's not strange that a flower petal would be found on her clothes but...

271
00:14:50,763 --> 00:14:52,763
Have the forensic check it anyway!

272
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:54,063
Yes, sir!

273
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:02,563
It seems that the flower petal is not from this flower garden, is it?

274
00:15:02,563 --> 00:15:03,663
No.

275
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:07,863
And besides, the color was lighter than when it was first found.

276
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:09,863
Maybe?

277
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:14,363
Is this the bag you received today?

278
00:15:15,863 --> 00:15:17,263
Right.

279
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:20,363
I see. So, that's the story!

280
00:15:20,363 --> 00:15:22,763
But, I don't have the evidence necessary.

281
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:25,663
But, it's good that the culprit was arrested.

282
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:26,963
That's right.

283
00:15:26,963 --> 00:15:29,663
Moreover, the flower garden won't be vandalized again.

284
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,763
It's not good at all!

285
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:35,963
It hasn't been solved where my brick disappeared to!

286
00:15:37,163 --> 00:15:40,663
The evidence should most likely still be there.

287
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:53,763
Hiding evidence, eh?

288
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:57,163
So, you were the real culprit after all.

289
00:15:57,163 --> 00:16:00,663
Well, I was almost deceived.

290
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:04,263
A corpse full of bruises.

291
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,663
The brick that was next to it.

292
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:08,663
No matter how you look at it,

293
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:10,663
Ms. Yamazaki looked to have fallen to her death

294
00:16:10,663 --> 00:16:12,763
from the emergency stairs, you see.

295
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,563
On the landing of the stairs,

296
00:16:14,563 --> 00:16:18,063
the shoeprints of Ms. Yamazaki and Mr. Okuda were found.

297
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:21,563
The way it is, it could only look as if Mr. Okuda

298
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,163
who had a grudge against the district center

299
00:16:23,163 --> 00:16:24,963
pushed Ms. Yamazaki to her death.

300
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:29,063
You tried to frame Mr. Okuda who had no alibi up as the culprit,

301
00:16:29,063 --> 00:16:31,363
but made two small mistakes.

302
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:35,363
The first is the victim's shoelaces.

303
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:36,863
On the landing of the stairs,

304
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,263
other than the shoeprints of Ms. Yamazaki and Mr. Okuda,

305
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:42,763
there were traces of a string being dragged.

306
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:45,563
Most likely, when the two got into a struggle,

307
00:16:45,563 --> 00:16:48,763
Ms. Yamazaki's shoestring untied.

308
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:49,963
But,

309
00:16:49,963 --> 00:16:54,063
The shoestring of the corpse that was lying in the flower garden was tied.

310
00:16:54,063 --> 00:17:00,263
Which means that Ms. Yamazaki didn't fall then.

311
00:17:00,263 --> 00:17:02,963
Ah, the flowers that are in bloom on the counter

312
00:17:02,963 --> 00:17:05,063
and the yard are beautiful.

313
00:17:05,063 --> 00:17:09,063
The flower that blooms so late at night, is it an evening primrose?

314
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:12,263
Even primroses are white when they bloom at sundown,

315
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:16,763
but are said to gradually turn pink deeper into the night it gets.

316
00:17:16,763 --> 00:17:20,763
The evening primrose was the other mistake you made.

317
00:17:20,763 --> 00:17:23,463
Evening primroses bloom only at night,

318
00:17:23,463 --> 00:17:26,163
so they are not grown in the children's flower garden.

319
00:17:26,163 --> 00:17:27,463
Despite, this,

320
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,763
the petal of this flower was found stuck to the back of the corpse.

321
00:17:35,563 --> 00:17:41,063
The fragrance of the evening primrose lead me to you, the real culprit.

322
00:17:41,063 --> 00:17:43,263
Isn't that right, Ms. Okamura?

323
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:46,763
I have no idea what you are talking about.

324
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:50,063
As for the shoestring maybe somebody tied it for her?

325
00:17:50,063 --> 00:17:53,063
Evening primroses can be found anywhere too, can't they?

326
00:17:53,063 --> 00:17:57,063
Even the police say that the culprit is that garden vandalist man.

327
00:17:57,063 --> 00:18:02,063
Right, everyone knew that Mr. Okuda was the vandalist.

328
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:03,863
He was in need of money,

329
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:06,563
so messed up gardens in order to sell young plants or bulbs.

330
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:09,763
And was trying to get jobs to fix the gardens.

331
00:18:09,763 --> 00:18:14,863
So you schemed to frame Mr. Okuda up.

332
00:18:14,863 --> 00:18:18,463
You witnessed Ms. Yamazaki and Mr. Okuda fighting with each other

333
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:23,363
on the landing in the morning, and decided to create a crime scene there.

334
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:25,863
And in order to get rid of Mr. Okuda's alibi,

335
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:28,163
you put in an order giving him false address

336
00:18:28,163 --> 00:18:30,463
to make a delivery at 20:00.

337
00:18:30,463 --> 00:18:32,163
What do you think you're saying?

338
00:18:32,163 --> 00:18:35,463
Ms. Yamazaki died at 20:00, right?

339
00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:38,863
At that time, I was part-timing at this shop,

340
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:42,063
and didn't go out anywhere between the hours of 19:00 to 21:30.

341
00:18:42,063 --> 00:18:45,163
You should know because you were with me right through.

342
00:18:45,163 --> 00:18:47,963
It's true that it's more than 5 kilometers from this shop

343
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:49,463
to the district center.

344
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:53,063
And it would at least take 10 minutes even to go and come back by car.

345
00:18:54,663 --> 00:18:56,563
That's an interesting deduction,

346
00:18:56,563 --> 00:18:59,563
but the most important part seems to be missing.

347
00:18:59,563 --> 00:19:01,463
When Ms. Yamazaki fell to her death,

348
00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:04,663
I wasn't able to be there.

349
00:19:04,663 --> 00:19:08,063
The key is the brick.

350
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:11,063
You took advantage of the vandalism case that started 3 days ago,

351
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:16,263
and started removing bricks from the garden without anyone noticing.

352
00:19:16,263 --> 00:19:19,563
And you lined it out on the garden of this cafe.

353
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,563
Ms. Yamazaki was not killed at the district center,

354
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:30,063
but rather, in this yard.

355
00:19:30,063 --> 00:19:32,663
So, your alibi is not valid anymore.

356
00:19:32,663 --> 00:19:37,763
In other words, this was a trick to fake the site of the crime!

357
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:41,463
Before opening the shop, you called Ms. Yamazaki over here,

358
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:44,563
put her to sleep after making her sniff a drug upstairs

359
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:48,563
and worked from 19:00 to 21:30 at the cafe on the 1st floor

360
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,763
and established your alibi.

361
00:19:50,763 --> 00:19:52,063
Part way through your part time work,

362
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:53,463
you left the shop for just 5 minutes around 20:00,

363
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:56,263
saying you had to use the restroom.

364
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:59,263
You put on the shoes of Ms. Yamazaki who was sleeping,

365
00:19:59,263 --> 00:20:02,563
and pushed her off the 3rd floor window

366
00:20:02,563 --> 00:20:05,463
onto the bricks that are lined out in the yard, and killed her.

367
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:06,663
At that time,

368
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:10,363
the petal of the evening primrose attached to the corpse's clothes.

369
00:20:10,363 --> 00:20:14,063
After that, you hid the body into the trunk of your car,

370
00:20:14,063 --> 00:20:15,763
and after closing the shop,

371
00:20:15,763 --> 00:20:19,863
you carried the body to the district center by car.

372
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:23,063
In the morning after hearing the conversation between Ayumi and I,

373
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:26,163
you knew that we were going on night patrol.

374
00:20:26,163 --> 00:20:28,263
So, you decided to go there before us, to set it up

375
00:20:28,263 --> 00:20:30,363
so that we would be the first to discover the corpse.

376
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:34,063
You probably thought that you'd have an immovable alibi.

377
00:20:34,063 --> 00:20:35,763
Listening to you talk for a while,

378
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:38,763
isn't everything you said till now a nothing more than your imagination?

379
00:20:38,763 --> 00:20:41,463
Do you have proof that I'm the culprit?

380
00:20:41,463 --> 00:20:43,863
The bricks that you took from the center

381
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:45,663
should still be in your yard.

382
00:20:45,663 --> 00:20:47,263
Hey, Conan!

383
00:20:47,263 --> 00:20:49,163
Yes!

384
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:55,363
Oh! Just as you said, Pops, there are a lot of bricks!

385
00:20:55,363 --> 00:20:57,563
After transporting the corpse,

386
00:20:57,563 --> 00:21:00,463
you were called right away for interrogation,

387
00:21:00,463 --> 00:21:04,463
so you wouldn't have had anytime to clean up your yard.

388
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,763
If we check the bricks,

389
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:11,363
a trace that Ms. Yamazaki was killed here should be detected.

390
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:16,363
This is just my deduction.

391
00:21:16,363 --> 00:21:19,863
You're the one who embezzled the management money, no?

392
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:22,263
Ms. Yamazaki who started looking into the embezzlement

393
00:21:22,263 --> 00:21:24,963
became a burden to you.

394
00:21:24,963 --> 00:21:28,363
That's right. I was in debt

395
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:30,663
and although I part-timed at my mother's cafe at night,

396
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:32,363
I still couldn't pay up

397
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:35,663
and stole money from the center.

398
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:37,563
Yamazaki who realized this

399
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:41,063
threatened to fire me.

400
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:46,463
That's why I... That woman...

401
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:15,763
My brick! I'm glad it's okay!

402
00:23:15,763 --> 00:23:18,363
The brick that Genta baked...

403
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,463
Where? Where? What kind is it?

404
00:23:20,463 --> 00:23:22,163
This.

405
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:26,363
-What? -Don't tell me this is...

406
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,063
Oh, you got it?

407
00:23:28,063 --> 00:23:31,063
Right! Eels over rice!

408
00:23:31,063 --> 00:23:34,363
-Not again. -Again?

409
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:36,563
Your feeling for eels over rice

410
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:38,963
is strong as any brick could be.

411
00:23:40,763 --> 00:23:44,563
"Next Episode" -My older sister would never commit suicide!

412
00:23:44,563 --> 00:23:46,463
You saw it yourself

413
00:23:46,463 --> 00:23:49,163
and yet why do you think she didn't?

414
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:50,663
But, something's funny.

415
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:53,063
For two people like that to be in the same school.

416
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:57,263
That's why I just can't believe that it was suicide!

417
00:23:57,263 --> 00:23:58,963
Well, in other words,

418
00:23:58,963 --> 00:24:02,863
it's to convince that girl and make her give up.

419
00:24:02,863 --> 00:24:05,263
This is also the duty of a great detective.

420
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:06,763
Next Conan,

421
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:10,863
"Girl's Academy's Window"

422
00:24:26,663 --> 00:24:28,863
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:28,863 --> 00:24:31,163
"Step ladder"

424
00:24:31,163 --> 00:24:33,563
Hey, wait up! I'm going to the next case!

425
00:24:33,563 --> 00:24:35,763
Pops, you're too attracted to the title of next week's episode.
