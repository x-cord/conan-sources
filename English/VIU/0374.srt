1
00:00:21,444 --> 00:00:23,143
Today, we're all going out to look at the stars.

2
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:24,643
We go out looking for a comet and discover a skeleton instead.

3
00:00:24,644 --> 00:00:26,343
Solve the mystery of the scattered cigarettes!

4
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:27,843
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:29,443
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:31,244
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,544
Abnormality observation?

8
00:01:57,545 --> 00:01:59,744
No, Genta.

9
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,244
Astronomical observation, astronomical observation.

10
00:02:03,245 --> 00:02:07,144
Dr. Agasa, are we going to go watch stars from now?

11
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:11,944
Yeah, I found a nice pension in the mountains of Gunma.

12
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:14,344
But why are you going outside to watch stars

13
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:16,544
at a cold time like this?

14
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:18,844
It's good because it's cold.

15
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:20,644
The colder it is, the cleaner the air,

16
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:22,444
and the better it is to watch the stars.

17
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:24,544
Beside, tonight is the new moon.

18
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:25,744
In other words,

19
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,944
it's just the night to carry out an astronomical observation.

20
00:02:27,945 --> 00:02:33,244
But, isn't it going to be boring just looking at the stars?

21
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:35,244
Come on, don't say that.

22
00:02:35,245 --> 00:02:37,244
You can study the stars,

23
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:40,444
and we may by chance discover a new stars.

24
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:43,044
If we do, it may be named after us.

25
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:46,144
-What? Our names! -What? Our names!

26
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:47,444
A star...

27
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:49,644
We can name it after ourselves?

28
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:50,845
Yes, right.

29
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:54,144
Of course that's impossible

30
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:55,444
when it comes to asteroids in

31
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:57,244
which the orbit has to be observed repeatedly

32
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:59,044
and verified though.

33
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,844
But there is a possibility

34
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:02,844
if the star is a comet that only requires to be found.

35
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:06,844
How about calling it Beika Youth Detective Squad Comet?

36
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:07,944
Sounds nice.

37
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:10,644
-Nice, isn't it? -Nope.

38
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:14,544
The only star you can give a name of your choice to is to asteroids.

39
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:17,144
Comets are named after the surnames of their discoverers,

40
00:03:17,145 --> 00:03:19,144
and moreover, the surnames of only the three people

41
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:21,244
who submitted their names the earliest can be given to the star.

42
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:25,244
Right, if a comet is found at the same time all over the world,

43
00:03:25,245 --> 00:03:28,544
it's possible that your name will be mixed with a foreign name.

44
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:32,544
Three people, me, and...

45
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,544
For example, Kobayashi, Burger, Millon.

46
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:38,444
So, if we find a comet

47
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:40,444
and apply for it quickly,

48
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:45,144
it could be Yoshida Tsuburaya Haibara comet, right?

49
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:46,544
Yeah, right?

50
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:48,444
Yes, well...

51
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:52,544
Yoshida, Tsuburaya, Haibara?

52
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:55,044
How come my name's not there?

53
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:57,144
Include Conan's name too.

54
00:03:57,145 --> 00:04:01,144
But it's only up to three names.

55
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:03,144
Conan, don't you?

56
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:05,745
Just what are you doing, Conan?

57
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:08,744
That man. He's the sports reporter, Masaharu Motoyama,

58
00:04:08,745 --> 00:04:11,144
the one that killed the professional baseball player Mr. Nose,

59
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:14,044
last time in Okinawa, right?

60
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,044
You were there at the time of the incident too, weren't you, Conan?

61
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:19,944
Yeah. I was bothered about something so...

62
00:04:19,945 --> 00:04:20,945
"Sports reporter, Masaharu Motoyama."

63
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:22,744
Bothered about what?

64
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:25,344
Well, it's not such a big deal but...

65
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:28,344
I was just wondering who he would call on his cell phone

66
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:31,544
during an interrogation session.

67
00:04:31,545 --> 00:04:33,744
The police already would've contacted

68
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:38,044
the late Mr. Nose's parents and family so...

69
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:41,144
I think it's Mr. Motoyama's personal acquaintance.

70
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:45,844
Darn! I should've directly asked him who he called.

71
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:47,744
Maybe...

72
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,744
it was baseball player Kobayashi?

73
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:54,044
The one who entered the team at the same time as Mr. Motoyama.

74
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:58,044
They were on an off-season travel program together, all three of them,

75
00:04:58,045 --> 00:04:59,944
and seemed to get along well together.

76
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:03,844
There's a possibility he informed him of the death of his best friend.

77
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,944
He seems to have succeeded his parents' Japanese inn

78
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:08,544
after he retired four years ago.

79
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:12,744
If I remember correctly, it was in a place called Kurayoshi in Tottori.

80
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,444
I saw it when it was introduced on TV once,

81
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:17,844
but it looked to be a nice inn.

82
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:19,345
I see.

83
00:05:20,645 --> 00:05:24,245
It seems to have nothing to do with the men in black.

84
00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:29,844
Kurayoshi.

85
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:32,445
Shinichi, don't tell me that you're...

86
00:05:39,645 --> 00:05:44,745
"Stars, a Cigarette and a Code (Part 1)"

87
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,044
Mr. Agasa, right? We've been waiting for you.

88
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:50,144
Please sign your name on our guest list.

89
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:51,944
All right.

90
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:53,844
Hiroshi Agasa.

91
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:55,544
Where is he?

92
00:05:55,545 --> 00:05:56,644
"Etsuko Nonomiya (28), Guest."

93
00:05:56,645 --> 00:05:59,945
He told you to come here too, didn't he?

94
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:02,844
Please tell me.

95
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,844
I want to apologize to him.

96
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:06,944
Where is Asao?

97
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,344
Asao, who is he?

98
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:09,644
Don't play dumb with me!

99
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:11,744
A man wearing the same ring that's a pair with this one!

100
00:06:11,745 --> 00:06:13,144
Asao Kono!

101
00:06:13,145 --> 00:06:16,444
You got an invitation card from him to, didn't you?

102
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:18,444
Ms. Nonomiya.

103
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,944
Invitation card?

104
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:24,944
Oh, no, you see, this is our first visit here.

105
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:27,144
Oh, really?

106
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:28,545
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:32,044
Was that a surprise...

108
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:34,144
I'm so sorry.

109
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,744
Who is she?

110
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:37,644
"Amatsuchi (34), Pension Owner" -Her name is Etsuko Nonomiya

111
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:40,844
and she's an under classman of the university that I went to.

112
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:42,144
The man, Kono that she was referring to

113
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:44,044
was also an underclassman of my university.

114
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:46,044
They were engaged.

115
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:49,844
They used to come and stay over here a lot together in the past,

116
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:53,044
but after they had a big fight here a year ago,

117
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:56,044
he stopped coming all together.

118
00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:58,044
Then last week, she seems to have received

119
00:06:58,045 --> 00:07:01,544
an invitation card asking her to come here

120
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:04,144
and she's been waiting here for the past three days.

121
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:06,744
Since he hasn't shown up at all,

122
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:09,044
she's been that way drinking from day time.

123
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:12,444
But, why would she think that I, who she hasn't even met before

124
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:15,044
would also get an invitation card?

125
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:17,144
It's only natural.

126
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,144
"Mikami, Futagawa" -Because we who don't even know him all that well,

127
00:07:20,145 --> 00:07:24,344
got an invitation card from that guy called Kono.

128
00:07:24,345 --> 00:07:29,444
Well, we met him once over here a year ago that day.

129
00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:31,944
Being that the subject in the invitation card was what it is,

130
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:33,444
we decided to at least come here.

131
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:36,944
May I see the invitation card?

132
00:07:36,945 --> 00:07:38,944
Yeah, here.

133
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:40,145
Thank you.

134
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:45,344
As a result of my one year observation,

135
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:48,944
I have come up with a discovery that would shake the basis of astronomy.

136
00:07:48,945 --> 00:07:51,144
I would like your opinion on the matter,

137
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:53,644
so please come to Pension Amatsuchi.

138
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:56,544
Of course I will foot the room charges.

139
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:58,144
If you can't come, it can't be helped,

140
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:02,744
but please make an effort to be there, Asao Kono.

141
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:05,344
Well, judging from the fact that he's not here,

142
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:08,844
despite two days already gone by it seems to have been a prank.

143
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:11,844
Shall we head back then, editor?

144
00:08:11,845 --> 00:08:13,444
Editor?

145
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:17,844
Yeah, we're writing an astronomical magazine called "Space Sunday".

146
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:21,245
And, Mr. Mikami here is the editor.

147
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,144
He's no ordinary editor, either.

148
00:08:25,145 --> 00:08:26,344
Oh, come on.

149
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:27,944
No big deal.

150
00:08:27,945 --> 00:08:32,544
What do you mean by his no ordinary editor?

151
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,644
Well, he discovered a new comet,

152
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:39,444
and is a great man who a star is named after.

153
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:40,744
-You... -You discovered one?

154
00:08:40,745 --> 00:08:42,144
Where did you find it?

155
00:08:42,145 --> 00:08:43,844
Tell us where too.

156
00:08:43,845 --> 00:08:46,344
Well, where that's not an easy question.

157
00:08:46,345 --> 00:08:48,545
Over there? Over here?

158
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:52,544
Then I suggest you climb up the road in back

159
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:53,845
of the pension to the hill beyond.

160
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,744
It's a scenic viewpoint,

161
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,144
and just great for viewing stars.

162
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:03,344
If you want, I'll lend you a telescope too.

163
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:04,845
For 5000 yen.

164
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,244
You're charging us for it.

165
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:11,344
-Be careful. -Okay!

166
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:14,744
All right. We'll find our star for sure!

167
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:16,045
Aye!

168
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:18,844
Hopeless amateurs.

169
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:21,844
Don't they know it's not that easy to find.

170
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:23,145
Right, editor?

171
00:09:24,145 --> 00:09:26,944
No, who knows.

172
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:28,744
No matter how knowledgeable you are,

173
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:31,944
whether you can find a star or not depends on luck.

174
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:35,344
If you're lucky, you can find one.

175
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:37,644
Right, editor?

176
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:40,044
Won't you find him for me with your luck

177
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:42,144
of having found a star?

178
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:44,144
The guy who was obsessed by stars

179
00:09:44,145 --> 00:09:46,844
and disappeared into the darkness of space.

180
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:49,745
My precious partner.

181
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:56,544
It sure is kind of far.

182
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:58,944
Come on, Dr. Agasa. Hang in there.

183
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:00,445
Hurry, hurry.

184
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:07,145
Isn't that the hill?

185
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:10,744
It's more a cliff than a hill.

186
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:13,944
You mean we're going to climb way up there?

187
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:16,044
Let's take a break.

188
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:18,944
Hey, let's climb up there before sundown.

189
00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:21,344
Treat the aged with kindness.

190
00:10:21,345 --> 00:10:25,544
You're usually telling me not to treat you like the aged.

191
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:27,744
Shall we rest about ten minutes then?

192
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:29,244
Agreed!

193
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:31,645
Darn, come on, man.

194
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:40,544
A rock, rock...

195
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:43,745
But, don't you think that invitation was sort of strange?

196
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,544
Would somebody write something like,

197
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:49,244
"If you can't come, it can't be helped"?

198
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:50,844
True.

199
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:52,544
There must've been some urgent reason

200
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:55,445
he wanted everyone to come here.

201
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:58,545
I found one!

202
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,544
What's up, Ayumi?

203
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:12,744
A skull?

204
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:14,444
No joke?

205
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,744
Why is a skull in a place like this?

206
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:19,344
There are some more scattered here.

207
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,544
What?

208
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:24,844
The lower jaw, the upper forelimb, and the thighbone.

209
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:26,544
Where's the body itself?

210
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:27,545
Over there?

211
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:31,345
What on earth?

212
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:36,144
The person probably fell from that cliff!

213
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:37,744
Yes, probably.

214
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:40,044
These are most likely

215
00:11:40,045 --> 00:11:42,244
the bones of someone who fell quite some time ago.

216
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:45,344
The bones may have scattered due to animals, rain and the wind.

217
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:46,444
No.

218
00:11:46,445 --> 00:11:48,544
This is a homicide case,

219
00:11:48,545 --> 00:11:50,244
and an extremely heinous one too.

220
00:11:50,245 --> 00:11:51,544
-What? -What?

221
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,644
Look, lime.

222
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:57,644
Lime has the quality of giving off heat after sucking up liquid.

223
00:11:57,645 --> 00:12:00,144
When lime is scattered around the corpse and the nearby area,

224
00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:03,544
it has the quality of giving off heat after being wet by rain

225
00:12:03,545 --> 00:12:06,944
and as a result, the pace at which the body rots is quickened.

226
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:10,444
Therefore, the body skeletonizes in a very short time.

227
00:12:10,445 --> 00:12:12,944
Maybe this skeleton is the Mr. Kono

228
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:16,044
that everybody was talking about back at the inn?

229
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:20,644
-No way. -But, he sent everybody the invitation card, didn't he?

230
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:24,044
-It could be the man called Kono. -What?

231
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:27,644
A ring and a cigarette case is under the rock.

232
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:29,844
The letters carved on the ring are,

233
00:12:29,845 --> 00:12:32,644
ETSUKO to ASAO.

234
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:35,344
It's most likely that Mr. Kono left these here,

235
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:39,544
before the killer came back down here, after pushing him off the cliff.

236
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:42,644
He left these here most probably as evidence that he was killed.

237
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:45,844
But, maybe the killer left them here deliberately.

238
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:47,244
If so, I think he'd leave it on Mr. Kono's finger

239
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:48,544
after stripping him naked.

240
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:52,144
Why would a killer who attempts to hide the identity of his victim

241
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:55,144
deliberately hide something like that under a rock.

242
00:12:55,145 --> 00:12:56,744
Will somebody lend me a handkerchief?

243
00:12:56,745 --> 00:12:58,444
Okay.

244
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,144
-Yes. -Thank you.

245
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:03,244
Then, what's this cigarette box?

246
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:05,444
If my deduction is correct,

247
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:06,945
this is probably...

248
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:14,344
All there is in here are cigarettes.

249
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:16,744
Just as I thought.

250
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:18,844
Don't tell me that...

251
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:22,344
Yeah, this is what Mr. Kono left behind.

252
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:23,944
It's a dying message.

253
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:26,645
Dying message?

254
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,233
What about this cigarette?

255
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:35,757
Yeah, It's very likely that the man called Asao Kono left clues

256
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:39,057
about who the killer before he was killed.

257
00:13:39,058 --> 00:13:44,357
But, isn't it just that two cigarettes out of six are torn?

258
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:46,757
Watch closely.

259
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:50,557
The two short cigarettes have filters on them, don't they?

260
00:13:50,558 --> 00:13:52,357
It goes to show that the cigarettes were deliberately torn short

261
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:54,957
and put into the cigarette box.

262
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,057
And besides, look.

263
00:13:56,058 --> 00:14:00,157
If you take a close look under the rock where the cigarette box was hidden,

264
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:02,757
it's pretty rotted. But the rest of the cigarettes

265
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,457
and the cigarettes that were torn apart then are disposed of, right?

266
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,157
In other words, Mr. Kono who left this behind

267
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:10,757
wants us to look at only the four long cigarettes

268
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:14,058
and two short cigarettes he put into the cigarette box.

269
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:18,257
We've got to go back and tell the people at the pension about this...

270
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:20,057
Hold it, Dr. Agasa.

271
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:22,157
It's not a good idea to tell the people of the pension about this.

272
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:23,257
Call the police first.

273
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:24,957
What? Why?

274
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,957
-Can't you tell? -What?

275
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,657
The guests at the pension right now are all people who have come

276
00:14:30,658 --> 00:14:32,157
because they received invitation cards from Mr. Kono.

277
00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:34,757
If these bones are really Mr. Kono's,

278
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:39,057
it's obvious that someone else sent them, right?

279
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:43,357
Moreover one year ago when Mr. Kono disappeared from the pension,

280
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:46,957
the people gathered now were also here back then.

281
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,757
If the reason these bones are scattered

282
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:51,757
are not because of rain, wind or animals,

283
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,857
but was scattered here deliberately by someone.

284
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:56,357
Yeah.

285
00:14:56,358 --> 00:14:58,357
The one who sent out the invitation cards is probably hoping

286
00:14:58,358 --> 00:15:01,257
that someone would find Mr. Kono's bones

287
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:05,057
and planning some evil scheme.

288
00:15:05,058 --> 00:15:07,657
What is that evil scheme?

289
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,057
Beats me.

290
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,657
At any rate, call the police.

291
00:15:10,658 --> 00:15:13,057
Hurry and contact them and have them come here.

292
00:15:13,058 --> 00:15:14,257
What's up, Dr. Agasa?

293
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:15,857
Oh, well,

294
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:17,857
it seems that this area is outside the service area

295
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:20,457
and I can't call.

296
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,057
We've got no choice then,

297
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:23,357
but to go back to the pension

298
00:15:23,358 --> 00:15:26,857
and call the police secretly.

299
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:28,357
The police?

300
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:30,057
What seems to be the matter?

301
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:33,458
Mr. Amatsuchi? What brings you here?

302
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,257
I recalled forgetting to put the heavy weight

303
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:38,358
of the telescope in the bag.

304
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:40,757
Oh, no.

305
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:42,757
-By the way, what seems to be the matter? -Oh, nothing...

306
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:45,857
-What the matter? -Nothing...

307
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:47,358
Did you find something strange?

308
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:49,758
Bones?

309
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:54,457
-Wait! -Oh no.

310
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:58,357
What? You found Asao's bones in the forest?

311
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:01,257
But, all you found were the bones, right?

312
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:03,757
Who knows if they're really Asao's or not?

313
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:06,757
Well, we found this beside the bones.

314
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:11,357
The pair ring carved with your initials that you gave him.

315
00:16:11,358 --> 00:16:15,657
But it could be that the Asao Kono killed somebody

316
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:18,457
and deliberately put the ring there.

317
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,957
But the ring was found...

318
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,358
Did Mr. Kono have a cavity?

319
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:29,357
His upper tooth to the right, the 2nd one from the molar.

320
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:31,558
His upper molar?

321
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:37,658
If so, those bones aren't Asao!

322
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:41,457
He did have a cavity all right,

323
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,757
but it was his front lower tooth.

324
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:45,757
-No! -Then, it's him after all.

325
00:16:45,758 --> 00:16:47,457
No doubt about it.

326
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,357
Hey, what do you mean?

327
00:16:50,358 --> 00:16:53,757
I'm sorry to say that the dental treatment was done

328
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:55,957
on the lower jaw central incisor.

329
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,957
In other words, it's exactly where you say it was.

330
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,357
He's lower front tooth had a cavity.

331
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:03,557
He deliberately said something else

332
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:08,457
so that you wouldn't just agree to what he said.

333
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,057
I'm sorry.

334
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:12,557
Oh no.

335
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:16,558
Which means that Asao is, Asao is...

336
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:22,657
At any rate, let's hurry and call the police.

337
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:26,058
But the phone doesn't seem working right.

338
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:30,857
This phone is only connected to an electric cord

339
00:17:30,858 --> 00:17:33,158
and doesn't have a module cable.

340
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:36,557
What?

341
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,657
Strange, I used this phone just a while ago.

342
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:43,257
Do you have any other phones or a spare cable?

343
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:45,057
This is the only phone

344
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:47,757
and I haven't bought any spare cables.

345
00:17:47,758 --> 00:17:50,457
Then, we can't call the police.

346
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,757
You have got to be kidding.

347
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:54,257
I'm going home by car.

348
00:17:54,258 --> 00:17:55,557
But, editor...

349
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:00,557
I don't think that's possible either.

350
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:01,558
What?

351
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,557
I just went outside and checked,

352
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:07,957
but it seems all the cars that are parked here have flat tires.

353
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:11,857
Somebody probably loosened the air valve and deflated the tires.

354
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,257
So that no one could use the cars,

355
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:16,557
in order to keep everyone confined here.

356
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:18,658
That's absurd.

357
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:23,757
Hey, don't tell me this has something to do with the guy Kono?

358
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:25,857
-I'm sure it does. -For sure.

359
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:28,257
Because that was homi...

360
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:30,557
Come to think of it, when I found the bones,

361
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:32,957
you guys were watching, right?

362
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,157
You saw the four long cigarettes and two short cigarettes

363
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,357
on the handkerchief, didn't you?

364
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:41,558
Hey! Isn't that a dying message?

365
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:45,257
No, I wouldn't say it was...

366
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:49,657
No. That's no dying message.

367
00:18:49,658 --> 00:18:51,757
I'm sure that...

368
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:59,657
Asao is just pretending to be dead to trouble me.

369
00:18:59,658 --> 00:19:02,057
-He's so cute. -Anyway, let's all stay in our rooms tonight

370
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,357
and not go out.

371
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:06,357
I think it's best to wait until daybreak.

372
00:19:06,358 --> 00:19:07,358
Yes.

373
00:19:28,758 --> 00:19:30,957
There are a total of six cigarettes,

374
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,457
four long ones and two short ones.

375
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,557
If the name is Futagawa, there is one extra match

376
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:38,357
and if the name is Amatsuchi, one more match stick is needed.

377
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:39,957
As for Ms. Nonomiya and Mr. Mikami,

378
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,257
their characters cannot be displayed with six matches.

379
00:19:42,258 --> 00:19:44,357
What if you write it in katakana?

380
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:45,857
That's impossible too.

381
00:19:45,858 --> 00:19:48,057
Futagawa would require 14 match sticks

382
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:52,157
and Amatsuchi 12, eight for Nonomiya

383
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:55,657
and for Mikami, nine matches would be necessary.

384
00:19:55,658 --> 00:19:57,857
What if you try their initials?

385
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:02,358
Like for Haibara Ai, it would be "HA", that's exactly six matches.

386
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:07,458
Then, are you saying that you're the killer?

387
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:11,057
Like I said, it's just an example.

388
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:14,057
Oh, an example.

389
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:16,957
Come to think of it Tsuburaya Mitsuhiko, TM

390
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,957
and Yoshida Ayumi, YA are also six matches.

391
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,457
True.

392
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,458
Kojima Genta is...

393
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,457
How romantic to think that only the three of us require six match sticks.

394
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:33,257
I'm Agasa Hiroshi, AH and can be displayed with six matches too.

395
00:20:33,258 --> 00:20:36,057
Wow, what a coincidence?

396
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:37,257
Hey.

397
00:20:37,258 --> 00:20:41,258
You just may be right about it being initials.

398
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,257
What? The killer is Mr. Futagawa?

399
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:49,358
Yeah. If those cigarettes really stand for initials...

400
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:52,657
Mr. Amatsuchi Ryoji is AR,

401
00:20:52,658 --> 00:20:55,157
Nonomiya Etsuko is NE,

402
00:20:55,158 --> 00:20:57,857
Mikami Heihachi is MH.

403
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:01,857
Only Futagawa Hajime, FH can be created with six matches, right?

404
00:21:01,858 --> 00:21:05,257
But, I wonder if it's a good idea to go see Mr. Futagawa in person.

405
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:08,658
Don't worry, I'm just going to throw him a catch question.

406
00:21:12,158 --> 00:21:14,458
Mr. Futagawa's not here.

407
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,157
The cigarette filter is still damp.

408
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:22,458
Not too long has passed yet since he left the room.

409
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:25,558
Somebody's walking outside.

410
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:28,757
That's Ms. Nonomiya?

411
00:21:28,758 --> 00:21:31,057
Oh no, not only Mr, Futagawa

412
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:33,957
but Mr. Mikami and Mr. Amatsuchi are nowhere in sight either.

413
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,657
Darn. I told them not to go outside.

414
00:21:36,658 --> 00:21:40,157
Mitsuhiko, Ayumi and I will go get Ms. Nonomiya back.

415
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:43,257
Dr. Agasa, Ai and Genta, go and look for the other three.

416
00:21:43,258 --> 00:21:45,257
Okay.

417
00:21:45,258 --> 00:21:46,657
Ms. Nonomiya!

418
00:21:46,658 --> 00:21:48,157
Where are you?

419
00:21:48,158 --> 00:21:50,457
Ms. Nonomiya!

420
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:55,857
That's the road that leads to the place we found the skeleton, right?

421
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:58,257
Then, maybe she went there to confirm

422
00:21:58,258 --> 00:22:00,257
if the bones were really Mr. Kono's.

423
00:22:00,258 --> 00:22:01,658
Oh no.

424
00:22:03,158 --> 00:22:04,358
What was that sound?

425
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,158
Mr. Futagawa?

426
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:11,757
No good. His neck is broken.

427
00:22:11,758 --> 00:22:12,758
-What? -What?

428
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,058
He's not breathing anymore.

429
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:17,257
He's holding something.

430
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:18,658
A cigarette case?

431
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:24,257
The same dying message again?

432
00:22:24,258 --> 00:22:26,357
No, this time...

433
00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:28,458
there's one more.

434
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:01,357
"Next Episode" -Hey, easy on the stuff and don't mess things up too much.

435
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:04,857
Oh, you brought a telescope with you, sir?

436
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:06,457
How long are you going to keep searching?

437
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,357
The only thing that could serve as a murder weapon

438
00:24:08,358 --> 00:24:10,058
would be this umbrella.

439
00:24:11,258 --> 00:24:13,657
Okay, the only one left is Mr. Amatsuchi,

440
00:24:13,658 --> 00:24:15,157
it's your turn.

441
00:24:15,158 --> 00:24:17,857
I saw him checking the guest list closely.

442
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:19,857
Over and over again.

443
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,757
Wrong.

444
00:24:21,758 --> 00:24:23,257
Next Conan,

445
00:24:23,258 --> 00:24:27,258
"Stars, a Cigarette and a Code (Part 2)"

446
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:45,457
Next Conan's Hint:

447
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:47,357
"Initial."

448
00:24:47,358 --> 00:24:48,557
Next week, the case will be solved.

449
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:50,558
The highlight is my super acting skills.
