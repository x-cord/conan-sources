1
00:00:00,656 --> 00:00:02,455
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,456 --> 00:00:04,255
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,256 --> 00:00:06,055
Today, we're on the set of a drama.

4
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:08,055
The members of the cast are human, too!

5
00:00:08,056 --> 00:00:09,655
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:11,555
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,556 --> 00:00:13,656
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,846 --> 00:02:00,945
Good evening, everyone.

9
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:03,945
I am Detective Kogoro Mouri.

10
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:07,946
The stage for today is this remote western style building.

11
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,146
A mystery entangled with love and hate.

12
00:02:14,146 --> 00:02:17,745
The focal point of this case is "colour".

13
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:19,845
When people go shopping,

14
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:24,846
they tend to unconsciously select the colour they like...

15
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:29,845
Even at the scene of a crime.

16
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:33,145
Let's meet again at the end of the show.

17
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:35,346
This was Kogoro Mouri.

18
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:39,646
Okay, cut!

19
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:44,446
Fantastic! Mr. Mouri, you were just great.

20
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:49,745
Dad, you were really awesome.

21
00:02:49,746 --> 00:02:51,145
Oh, really?

22
00:02:51,146 --> 00:02:54,546
You could've cut out that wink at the end of the scene, though.

23
00:02:56,246 --> 00:03:02,046
"Invisible Suspect (Part 1)"

24
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:08,545
Well, thank you very much. You were really a great help!

25
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:12,345
The popular actor who always does the opening prologue for this drama

26
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:14,745
caught a nasty cold.

27
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:16,645
You don't have to use me just as a pinch-hitter,

28
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:18,945
do feel free to call on me anytime!

29
00:03:18,946 --> 00:03:21,045
If it's okay with you, I don't mind acting

30
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:23,845
in this detective drama as a special guest or something either.

31
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:25,245
Well, not really.

32
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,446
That's impossible, Mr. Detective.

33
00:03:28,446 --> 00:03:32,145
Because in this story...

34
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:35,645
There are only the widowed mistress, her daughter the shrew,

35
00:03:35,646 --> 00:03:37,446
their decrepit butler...

36
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:43,045
"Yoshiki Kazami (28)" -and aside from the daughter's murdered husband

37
00:03:43,046 --> 00:03:46,545
and my role as a detective, there are only these five characters.

38
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:50,545
Hey, what's with that shrew bit?

39
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:51,945
"Kasumi Namihara (26)" -I'm supposed to be a character

40
00:03:51,946 --> 00:03:54,145
that slightly like flashy things. That's about all, isn't it?

41
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:56,545
The character turns out a shrew because you're the one playing the role.

42
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:58,345
What did you just say?

43
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:00,645
By the way, Kazami,

44
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:03,045
"Akira Nagumo (60)" -I didn't like you remark, "decrepit" either.

45
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:06,345
I just turned 60.

46
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,045
I wasn't referring to your age.

47
00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:11,045
I meant that your acting is decrepit.

48
00:04:11,046 --> 00:04:12,645
What?

49
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:15,146
I hear that you were a great actor some time in the past, though.

50
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:18,045
Now, now.

51
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:20,945
Cool it, Dad.

52
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:23,945
"Nobuharu Nagumo (31)" -Let's not quarrel just before shooting the drama.

53
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:25,546
Mr. Kazami, please calm down.

54
00:04:27,546 --> 00:04:30,446
Ms. Ujo sure is late, though.

55
00:04:31,846 --> 00:04:34,945
Are you referring to that Ms. Ujo...

56
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:38,745
The one who used to be the number one comforting actress, Ruri Ujo?

57
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:41,345
Huh? Yes.

58
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:44,445
You mean, I get to see Ms. Ujo in person?

59
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:46,645
Huh? Get to see her in person?

60
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:50,345
She's the one who named you to substitute to do the opening prologue.

61
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:51,446
What?

62
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:55,346
I don't know if she's some former healer type actress...

63
00:04:56,846 --> 00:05:01,145
I sure wouldn't want to be healed by an old maid like her.

64
00:05:01,146 --> 00:05:04,445
Oh, my. I wouldn't want that either.

65
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:07,845
You're no more than a failure of an idol kid.

66
00:05:07,846 --> 00:05:11,046
"Ruri Ujo (37)" -who smells like piss.

67
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:15,845
You're really her!

68
00:05:15,846 --> 00:05:19,545
You're even prettier than on TV!

69
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:21,845
Well, hello.

70
00:05:21,846 --> 00:05:24,245
How do you do? I'm Kogoro Mouri.

71
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:26,745
I hear that you're the one who named me to take this job?

72
00:05:26,746 --> 00:05:28,945
I don't think it's the fist time we're meeting, is it?

73
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:32,245
Really? Have we met somewhere before?

74
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:33,445
Oh, come on.

75
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:36,746
Doesn't this mole under my lips remind you either?

76
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:39,645
Kogoro!

77
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:41,446
Mole?

78
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:51,245
Ruri Doigaki?

79
00:05:51,246 --> 00:05:53,045
Bull's eye!

80
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:56,645
Rurippe? Long time no see!

81
00:05:56,646 --> 00:05:57,745
You can say that again!

82
00:05:57,746 --> 00:05:59,445
We haven't seen each other since junior high school!

83
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:03,245
Huh? Don't tell me they know each other?

84
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:04,446
No kidding.

85
00:06:05,046 --> 00:06:07,645
I had no idea whatsoever!

86
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:09,345
Your last name is different, too.

87
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:13,645
And besides, back then you were wearing glasses with super thick lens.

88
00:06:13,646 --> 00:06:16,545
Well? I turned out to be pretty foxy, don't you think?

89
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:18,246
You did, you sure did.

90
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:21,845
But why haven't you gotten married yet?

91
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:22,945
Being as beautiful as you are,

92
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:25,345
I'm sure you've got a multitude of guys to pick from.

93
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:26,645
Don't be silly.

94
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:30,146
It's because one-sidedly in love with you all these years, why else?

95
00:06:32,446 --> 00:06:35,345
Please stop joking with him.

96
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:36,846
Because he's bound to take you seriously.

97
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:39,345
Oh, my. Who is she?

98
00:06:39,346 --> 00:06:42,745
She is just some girl who lives in the neighborhood.

99
00:06:42,746 --> 00:06:44,645
I am his daughter, Ran!

100
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:47,246
Oh, my. Then, she's Eri's daughter?

101
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:50,345
Do you know my mother?

102
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:51,745
Yes.

103
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:55,245
I was with her all the way from kindergarten to junior high school.

104
00:06:55,246 --> 00:06:57,646
But it still is sure a mystery.

105
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:01,845
As to why Eri, the smartest girl in school

106
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:04,745
and Kogoro, the most mischievous boy

107
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:06,745
fell so lovey-dovey in love as they did

108
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:09,245
and finally ended up marrying each other.

109
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:11,245
Very true.

110
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:14,546
You mean they were in love with each other for that long?

111
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:16,446
Hey...

112
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:17,945
Yes!

113
00:07:17,946 --> 00:07:21,245
Eri who always kept her cool would really get upset

114
00:07:21,246 --> 00:07:23,745
and go all out when her counterpart was Kogoro!

115
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:27,945
So, we all took it to be a lover's quarrel.

116
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:29,446
And they were constantly being teased.

117
00:07:30,846 --> 00:07:33,245
They're still quarreling to this day.

118
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,845
What a surprise though.

119
00:07:34,846 --> 00:07:38,646
That the Kogoro that I used to know is now a renown detective.

120
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:46,745
Okay, let's start camera rehearsal for scene 134!

121
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:49,146
Ready, start!

122
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:55,445
The corpse in front of the fireplace is covered with a gray tablecloth.

123
00:07:55,446 --> 00:08:00,445
And the victim's black coat is hanging on over the chair of that table.

124
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,845
Near the corpse, on the floor

125
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:06,645
is the murder weapon,

126
00:08:06,646 --> 00:08:09,146
a golf club with a white head cover on it.

127
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:14,845
I guess we can say that the case has already been solved.

128
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:17,345
Don't keep us in suspense, just spit it out!

129
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:19,645
Come on, tell us who it is.

130
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:22,945
Who on earth is the killer?

131
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:27,645
I was actually supposed to explain what went on, but...

132
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:28,845
Hey.

133
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:30,745
There's no such dialogue in the script.

134
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:32,746
Tonight, Detective Mouri...

135
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,845
Let's have you solve the case.

136
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:37,145
Huh?

137
00:08:37,146 --> 00:08:41,646
First, tell us why the killer covered the corpse with a tablecloth.

138
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:44,146
That's probably because...

139
00:08:44,846 --> 00:08:49,345
Because the killer loved the victim.

140
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:51,145
That's why the killer didn't want to leave the corpse there

141
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:53,045
without doing anything about it.

142
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:56,245
But the coat was on the chair, you know.

143
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:58,745
Why did the killer go to the trouble of using the tablecloth?

144
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,745
The reason is...

145
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:05,845
because the gray tablecloth seemed to be warmer than the black coat.

146
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:06,846
Huh?

147
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:11,046
Hey, don't tell me that you're serious about what you just said.

148
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:13,345
Give me a break.

149
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:16,645
You were dropping hints in the opening prologue yourself.

150
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:20,645
Why does gray seem warmer than black?

151
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:22,946
Huh? Don't you think so?

152
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:27,445
Your friend's not all that great either, is he?

153
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:30,145
Dad, talk seriously.

154
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:33,245
Come on. Get serious, Kogoro!

155
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:36,746
No way! This is as far as this old man goes.

156
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:43,745
Gosh.

157
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:45,345
He has appeared!

158
00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:47,545
The Sleeping Kogoro!

159
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,445
Excuse me.

160
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:51,645
Since the deduction was so simple,

161
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:53,245
I sort of felt like playing a bit of a prank.

162
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:54,545
What?

163
00:09:54,546 --> 00:09:56,545
It wasn't that the killer

164
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:59,445
wanted to cover the corpse with the gray tablecloth,

165
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:02,845
the killer didn't want to cover the corpse with the black coat.

166
00:10:02,846 --> 00:10:06,045
Because the killer likes the colour black.

167
00:10:06,046 --> 00:10:10,545
It's most likely that the killer subconsciously thought

168
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:12,945
that using a favorite colour at the scene of the murder

169
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,446
may bring on suspicion.

170
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:18,745
See, please take a good look at the golf bag

171
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:21,345
that is left standing against the fireplace.

172
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:27,045
Only the club with the black head cover is sticking out, right?

173
00:10:27,046 --> 00:10:29,345
This is because the killer was going to use the club with the black cover

174
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:30,945
as the murder weapon,

175
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:32,645
but decided against it while pulling it out.

176
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:34,745
It's an evidence that the killer decided to use the white ones instead.

177
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:37,445
Furthermore, taking into consideration that the furniture in this room

178
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:39,645
as well as the curtains are all coordinated with the colour black,

179
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:42,445
shows that the owner of this house

180
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:46,145
that is the killer is wearing a black dress.

181
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,845
Rurippe, it's the role you're playing,

182
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:50,846
who is the mistress of this house.

183
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:56,246
Don't you agree?

184
00:10:59,046 --> 00:11:02,646
Amazing! Just as expected of the Sleeping Kogoro.

185
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:05,846
He hit the bull's eye.

186
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:11,146
Just as rumor has it, you didn't let us down, Kogoro.

187
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,945
Gosh. Why didn't you start off seriously to begin with?

188
00:11:15,946 --> 00:11:19,045
The real thing is distinguished after all.

189
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,845
Corpses aren't supposed to move!

190
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,046
Hey!

191
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:26,046
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

192
00:11:27,346 --> 00:11:29,246
Are you okay, Nobuharu?

193
00:11:30,446 --> 00:11:31,645
Kasumi?

194
00:11:31,646 --> 00:11:34,945
So, after that playwright, you're switching over to that guy?

195
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:36,945
Huh?

196
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,945
This was still supposed to be off the records, right?

197
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:42,545
Hey, you! Enough is enough!

198
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:46,545
Are you sure want to talk to me like that, old fart?

199
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:52,645
I know about you secretly seeing a young lover night after night.

200
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:53,646
What?

201
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:58,745
I'm not really sure who or where that lady is yet,

202
00:11:58,746 --> 00:12:01,545
but I sort of have an idea.

203
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:04,445
I do have an idea.

204
00:12:04,446 --> 00:12:06,146
Let me go!

205
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:14,145
What's with that look on your faces, you guys?

206
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:15,545
I could make this drama go down the drain

207
00:12:15,546 --> 00:12:18,145
if you want it that way, you know?

208
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:20,045
What a bummer.

209
00:12:20,046 --> 00:12:22,645
I'm going to go take a nap in the room until I feel more up to it,

210
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:25,046
so go ahead and film the scenes that I don't appear in.

211
00:12:41,773 --> 00:12:43,672
What's with that guy?

212
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:45,772
He's the oldest son of the owner of the newspaper agency

213
00:12:45,773 --> 00:12:47,572
that is the main sponsor for this drama.

214
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:49,172
I see.

215
00:12:49,173 --> 00:12:52,172
That's why he knows so much of what's going on behind the scenes.

216
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:53,472
Yes.

217
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:56,772
And to make things worse, his obnoxious character

218
00:12:56,773 --> 00:12:58,772
seems to be getting high ratings among the viewers.

219
00:12:58,773 --> 00:13:01,172
To be honest, I really don't want to act on a program

220
00:13:01,173 --> 00:13:04,272
where he's the star of the show, but I have no choice.

221
00:13:04,273 --> 00:13:06,872
Because my office says I should since the rating is high.

222
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:08,672
Well, it doesn't bother me much

223
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:11,073
now that I got to see you after so long, Kogoro.

224
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:16,372
Okay. Why don't we take a 30 minute break?

225
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:18,372
And start shooting again after refreshing our feelings a bit!

226
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:19,673
Yes, sir...

227
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:21,873
What?

228
00:13:21,874 --> 00:13:24,272
Fighting over sauce and shoyu?

229
00:13:24,273 --> 00:13:26,472
You mean Mom and Dad?

230
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,572
That's right.

231
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,172
They got into a great battle during home economics class

232
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:31,972
in elementary school over whether sauce or shoyu

233
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:33,572
should be used on sunny side up.

234
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:35,172
Eri insisted that sauce should be used

235
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:36,872
because sunny side up is a western style dish,

236
00:13:36,873 --> 00:13:40,273
but Kogoro insisted that the Japanese should use shoyu.

237
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,772
It puzzles me even more.

238
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:47,072
So, why'd they get married?

239
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:50,572
But the order in which they ate what was made

240
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:52,672
was exactly the same,

241
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:54,872
so the entire class burst out laughing.

242
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:59,172
Next, they get into a fight saying, "Stop copying me!"

243
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:03,172
It's really hard to tell whether they get along or not.

244
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:05,772
Never mind about the past already.

245
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:08,472
No. Please tell me more about it!

246
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,673
Hey.

247
00:14:13,273 --> 00:14:15,773
Huh? What is it?

248
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:21,172
Snow.

249
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:23,473
See, it's snowing.

250
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:29,072
They did say that it may snow today on the weather forecast.

251
00:14:29,073 --> 00:14:32,472
Hey, why don't we all go outside and watch the snow?

252
00:14:32,473 --> 00:14:36,272
But we've only got five minutes of break time left.

253
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:38,572
Who cares if it's only five minutes?

254
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,272
It's the first snowfall this year, you know!

255
00:14:40,273 --> 00:14:41,472
I guess so.

256
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:43,073
Come on, let's hurry.

257
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:51,572
I love it when it snows after all.

258
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:53,172
Right, Conan?

259
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:56,172
What seems to be the matter?

260
00:14:56,173 --> 00:14:58,672
I don't see Ruri around.

261
00:14:58,673 --> 00:15:00,172
Huh?

262
00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:01,972
Where's Ruri?

263
00:15:01,973 --> 00:15:03,272
Huh?

264
00:15:03,273 --> 00:15:06,473
I thought I came out together with her.

265
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:10,572
Rurippe?

266
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:11,773
Darn it!

267
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:18,073
Rurippe?

268
00:15:18,973 --> 00:15:20,273
Rurippe?

269
00:15:33,373 --> 00:15:34,573
Kogoro.

270
00:15:37,173 --> 00:15:40,872
No good, his pupils are completely dilated.

271
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,672
He's already dead.

272
00:15:42,673 --> 00:15:45,572
Ran, call the police.

273
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:47,872
Okay.

274
00:15:47,873 --> 00:15:49,872
But who did it?

275
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:52,472
Who could've done something so ruthless like this?

276
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,472
Beats me.

277
00:15:54,473 --> 00:15:57,772
He was the type to make enemies so...

278
00:15:57,773 --> 00:15:59,672
But in cases like this

279
00:15:59,673 --> 00:16:02,072
isn't the first one to be suspected

280
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:03,272
is the one who first found the body?

281
00:16:03,273 --> 00:16:04,473
Huh?

282
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:07,972
No, I didn't do it.

283
00:16:07,973 --> 00:16:09,572
When I came to this room,

284
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:11,972
he was already smeared with blood!

285
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:15,072
It's true. Please believe me, Kogoro.

286
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:16,673
Yes, I believe you.

287
00:16:28,273 --> 00:16:30,172
We won't be fooled by your crying and all!

288
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:33,272
An actress' tears is one of her weapons.

289
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:35,172
Hey, Kasumi.

290
00:16:35,173 --> 00:16:36,672
But if things go as is,

291
00:16:36,673 --> 00:16:39,172
we may also be suspected of homicide, you know?

292
00:16:39,173 --> 00:16:41,273
Everything will be fine. We'll be okay.

293
00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:47,072
The victim is Mr. Yoshiki Kazami, age 28.

294
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,472
The cause of death is loss of blood due to damage

295
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:50,773
to the carotid artery.

296
00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:55,972
He was probably attacked while asleep on this sofa here

297
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,572
and slashed in the throat or something.

298
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:00,272
The estimated time of death

299
00:17:00,273 --> 00:17:04,972
is between 7:50 pm when the victim came here to take a nap

300
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:08,372
to the time he was found dead at 8:20 pm.

301
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:09,872
A period of 30 minutes.

302
00:17:09,873 --> 00:17:12,173
I think it was shorter.

303
00:17:13,373 --> 00:17:17,772
Because when we were looking around this house

304
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:20,972
and came into this room on the way, he was snoring away and sleeping.

305
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,272
Hey, Conan!

306
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:27,173
That was just around 8:00 pm. Isn't that right, Ran?

307
00:17:27,873 --> 00:17:30,572
Yes. Because Dad looked at his watch

308
00:17:30,573 --> 00:17:33,172
saying that he was fast asleep in 10 minutes.

309
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:35,872
Ran and Conan!

310
00:17:35,873 --> 00:17:37,473
Which means that...

311
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:41,773
Mr. Mouri!

312
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:44,972
So, you're here after all.

313
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:49,172
Thank you for looking after my younger brother the other day.

314
00:17:49,173 --> 00:17:50,772
Oh, no.

315
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:52,273
That was really no big deal.

316
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,672
Kogoro, do you know him?

317
00:17:56,673 --> 00:17:58,272
Yes.

318
00:17:58,273 --> 00:17:59,872
How do you do?

319
00:17:59,873 --> 00:18:03,172
I'm Inspector Yokomizo from the Shizuoka Prefectural Police.

320
00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:05,872
I've finally got to meet you, Mrs. Mouri!

321
00:18:05,873 --> 00:18:07,072
Huh?

322
00:18:07,073 --> 00:18:10,072
Am I wrong?

323
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:11,172
No.

324
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,872
Well, I guess you're wrong. But then again maybe not.

325
00:18:14,873 --> 00:18:16,373
Wrong!

326
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:19,972
I'm only joking. It's a just a joke.

327
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:23,072
Huh? Don't tell me that you're...

328
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:25,873
Ruri Ujo, the actress?

329
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:27,873
Yes.

330
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:30,672
Huh? And you're...

331
00:18:30,673 --> 00:18:33,672
You and you, too.

332
00:18:33,673 --> 00:18:36,072
What's going on here?

333
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,672
Why are there so many actors and actresses here?

334
00:18:38,673 --> 00:18:41,872
It's just as if you're shooting a drama or something here.

335
00:18:41,873 --> 00:18:44,473
That's what we're doing here.

336
00:18:46,173 --> 00:18:48,572
So, this is how it goes?

337
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:50,372
You're shooting a detective story here at this European style building

338
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:53,272
out in the rural side of Mountain Fuji

339
00:18:53,273 --> 00:18:57,072
when a real homicide happened to occur.

340
00:18:57,073 --> 00:19:00,472
So, this is indeed a case of the biter being bitten.

341
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,872
Well, I guess so.

342
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:05,472
And? In the 20 minutes after 8 pm,

343
00:19:05,473 --> 00:19:07,972
when the murder is thought to have been committed,

344
00:19:07,973 --> 00:19:10,672
the shooting was stopped so everyone could take a break.

345
00:19:10,673 --> 00:19:14,072
And all you staff members stayed in groups of more than two people,

346
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:15,972
so all of you have an alibi.

347
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:20,172
The ones without an alibi are Ms. Ruri Ujo, who found the corpse

348
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:22,072
and each of the actors and actresses who went back

349
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:25,072
to their respective rooms to check the dialogue in the script.

350
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:27,272
Which is Ms. Kasumi Namihara.

351
00:19:27,273 --> 00:19:29,372
Mr. Akira Nagumo,

352
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:31,872
and Mr. Nobuharu Nagumo,

353
00:19:31,873 --> 00:19:34,273
the four of you.

354
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:36,572
Ms. Ujo.

355
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:39,472
Please explain how things were when you discovered the corpse.

356
00:19:39,473 --> 00:19:40,572
Yes, sir.

357
00:19:40,573 --> 00:19:43,472
Since we decided to take a break, Kogoro here...

358
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,372
No. Mr. Mouri and everybody else including myself

359
00:19:45,373 --> 00:19:48,272
went looking around inside the building.

360
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:50,772
Then, we noticed that it began to snow.

361
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,172
So, we invited the staff to come along

362
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:54,473
and went outside to look at the snow.

363
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:58,272
Since the snow was so beautiful,

364
00:19:58,273 --> 00:20:00,372
I wanted Mr. Kazami to take a look at it, too.

365
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:02,072
So, I came over to this room.

366
00:20:02,073 --> 00:20:03,772
Besides, he was sulky

367
00:20:03,773 --> 00:20:06,072
after going through what he did during the shooting, too.

368
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:08,572
But when I opened the door,

369
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:10,873
he was lying on the floor smeared with blood.

370
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:15,672
I thought he was joking and shook him,

371
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,872
but he didn't answer.

372
00:20:17,873 --> 00:20:21,672
That's when I finally realized that he was dead and screamed.

373
00:20:21,673 --> 00:20:23,272
I see.

374
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:27,672
So, the three of you heard her scream and ran over here.

375
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:28,772
Yes.

376
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:30,172
That's right.

377
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:33,172
Okay. Will the four of you

378
00:20:33,173 --> 00:20:36,372
go to the other room and go through a body check?

379
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:39,072
Huh? Why?

380
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:41,372
We can't find it.

381
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,172
It isn't anywhere in this building.

382
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:47,672
We haven't found the approximately 10 centimeter long blade

383
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:49,173
that was used to slit Kazami's throat.

384
00:20:55,873 --> 00:20:57,672
Inspector Yokomizo!

385
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,772
How about it?

386
00:20:58,773 --> 00:21:00,572
Did you find the weapon?

387
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:04,672
Well, all four of them had nothing like that on them.

388
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:06,472
We also checked the staff's belongings,

389
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:10,072
and the other rooms from one end to the other.

390
00:21:10,073 --> 00:21:11,772
But things that could've been used as the murder weapon

391
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:13,572
were only the knife in the kitchen,

392
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,572
a small knife for cutting fruit,

393
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:19,173
and a cutter knife that was found in the tool box of the staff.

394
00:21:20,573 --> 00:21:23,973
We found no luminol reaction from any of those things.

395
00:21:25,873 --> 00:21:27,472
All the victim had on him

396
00:21:27,473 --> 00:21:30,573
was this pack of cigarettes, this lighter, and his wallet.

397
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:32,472
We're searching inside the drains

398
00:21:32,473 --> 00:21:35,972
and around the building with a metal detector,

399
00:21:35,973 --> 00:21:38,172
but we haven't got any report that anything was found yet.

400
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,372
Darn it.

401
00:21:39,373 --> 00:21:41,872
Even though we've already found the golf club and coat

402
00:21:41,873 --> 00:21:45,373
that the killer might have used to commit the murder...

403
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:49,172
why can't we find the murder weapon?

404
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:51,172
Moreover, the glove and the coat

405
00:21:51,173 --> 00:21:52,872
are props that are used when filming dramas,

406
00:21:52,873 --> 00:21:55,272
but it seems that nobody was in the room

407
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,873
where these things were during break time.

408
00:21:58,473 --> 00:22:02,172
Which means that anybody could've taken it with considerable ease.

409
00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:05,172
And? Where are the four suspects now?

410
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:08,473
I have them waiting in the room together with Mr. Mouri.

411
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:14,303
If the killer is among them,

412
00:22:14,304 --> 00:22:16,403
it would be impossible to get rid of the murder weapon

413
00:22:16,404 --> 00:22:19,803
by taking it somewhere far away in such a short time.

414
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:21,504
And yet, why?

415
00:22:23,704 --> 00:22:26,104
Why can't the murder weapon be found?

416
00:23:59,804 --> 00:24:02,903
"Next Episode" -Something's not right.

417
00:24:02,904 --> 00:24:06,203
I can't figure out why Ruri suddenly invites everyone to go outside

418
00:24:06,204 --> 00:24:08,504
after seeing the snow through the window.

419
00:24:10,904 --> 00:24:12,204
Oh, no!

420
00:24:13,404 --> 00:24:14,503
That brat!

421
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:17,103
He's roaming around the scene of the crime again.

422
00:24:17,104 --> 00:24:18,504
Hey!

423
00:24:21,004 --> 00:24:23,803
I see! I got it!

424
00:24:23,804 --> 00:24:29,804
