1
00:00:21,117 --> 00:00:22,916
In today's case, the suspect is a police officer's friend.

2
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:24,316
How far will the love of the two go

3
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:26,016
after overcoming the obstacle filled scene?

4
00:00:26,017 --> 00:00:27,516
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,517 --> 00:00:29,316
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:31,217
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:56,048
Hearing that he would be dispatched to Tottori

8
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,848
to work on a joint investigation project,

9
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:00,748
Officer Takagi is flustered.

10
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:03,948
Despite the fact that they may have to be separated for three years,

11
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:07,148
Officer Sato remains the same as always.

12
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:08,448
While all this is going on,

13
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,248
we happen to witness the suspect of a homicide case.

14
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:13,548
And...

15
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:16,448
"Yui Shimura" -You're the one who stabbed Hirotoshi, aren't you?

16
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:18,948
What? Me? Commit murder?

17
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:21,248
"Akira Kato" -Just what are you talking about? Out of the blue like that.

18
00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:24,048
What's going on? Cut out the noise.

19
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:25,248
What?

20
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:28,148
-What? -Officer Chiba?

21
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:31,049
This is interesting.

22
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:38,849
"Love Story at Police Headquarters 6 (Part 2)"

23
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:41,448
Hey, Chiba! Come here.

24
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:43,048
Oh, yes, sir.

25
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:44,249
What is it?

26
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:51,749
Chiba!

27
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:58,048
Hey! Chiba! Is it true?

28
00:02:58,049 --> 00:02:59,748
What you said about being with that man

29
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:01,648
and watching TV with him during the time of the crime?

30
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:04,148
You're not lying, are you?

31
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:07,849
Chiba! I'm asking if you swear by this Cherry Blossom crest!

32
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:11,949
Yes, sir! I swear!

33
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:16,949
I see.

34
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:19,449
Sorry.

35
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:23,549
-Chiba. -Yes, sir.

36
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:28,349
Being a police officer is a crummy job.

37
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:35,848
Think...

38
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,848
Hurry, the continuation...

39
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,848
Next it's finally episode four!

40
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:43,148
Yaiba's archrival the Potato Baron appears!

41
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:47,049
"The Conspiracy of the Potato Baron!"

42
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:54,049
Come to think of it. If I remember correctly...

43
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,848
No doubt about it!

44
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:23,048
The killer is Mr. Kato after all!

45
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:27,348
He deceived Officer Chiba and used him to establish his alibi.

46
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:30,549
He twisted the passage of time with blood smeared hands.

47
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:34,948
I can't find a thing.

48
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:37,048
Neither can I find the gray parka nor the black knapsack

49
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:39,049
that the suspicious looking man had on him.

50
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:42,248
How is it over there?

51
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,148
Nothing here.

52
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:45,848
How about over there?

53
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:48,848
Nothing anywhere.

54
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:51,048
It doesn't seem to be around.

55
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:52,148
I guess not.

56
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:53,549
Not here, anyways.

57
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:59,048
I guess Mr. Kato who is freeloading here with you

58
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,348
is not a suspect after all.

59
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:03,248
Yeah.

60
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:05,848
Then, who on earth is it?

61
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:07,848
The man that looked like Mr. Kato

62
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,448
that the children saw near the crime scene.

63
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:14,448
He was probably another man who looked very much like him!

64
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:16,848
Because during the time of the crime,

65
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,748
Mr. Kato has an alibi that he was here watching "Morning Live Seven"

66
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:21,549
with Officer Chiba.

67
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:28,648
Okay, we'll leave for now!

68
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:31,948
We've got to send the children home too.

69
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:34,849
Anyway, that's enough for today.

70
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,348
Gosh.

71
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:42,748
Inspector Megure told me to learn something from this veteran officer.

72
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:44,649
But at this rate...

73
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:47,648
Hey, Officer Chiba.

74
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:48,848
Officer Chiba!

75
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,948
Oh, yes!

76
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,248
Will you go get Mr. Kato who's waiting in the police car?

77
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:56,948
We can't go home without telling him goodbye.

78
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:58,349
I'll go get him!

79
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,048
So, we've got to start all over again.

80
00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:09,048
I hope it won't take too long.

81
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:10,748
Take too long?

82
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:13,648
Wait. If it takes long for this case to be solved...

83
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:17,548
Maybe I won't have to be dispatched to Tottori for the joint investigation

84
00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:20,748
and stay here with Officer Sato.

85
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:22,848
You idiot! Just what's wrong with you?

86
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,448
I'm a police officer,

87
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,548
so I've got to solve the case as soon as possible.

88
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:29,148
Hey, this is no time to be absorbed in your thoughts.

89
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:30,648
Don't worry.

90
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:34,748
I'll make sure I get this case solved before leaving for Tottori.

91
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:36,348
Yes, sir.

92
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:37,548
Well, if it's going to take long,

93
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:40,048
just have someone else to take over the case.

94
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:41,348
It's as simple as that.

95
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:42,848
That's right.

96
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:44,248
Everything will be fine.

97
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:45,848
What?

98
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:48,549
Everything will be fine, Officer Takagi.

99
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:54,749
I don't think'll take that long.

100
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:00,348
I've been telling you, haven't I?

101
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:03,148
During the time of the crime from 7 am to 7:30 am,

102
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:05,548
I was watching TV together with Chiba in the living room!

103
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:07,048
Come...

104
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:09,348
Excuse me, Mr. Kato!

105
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:12,549
What was that program you were watching?

106
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:16,348
Like I said, "Morning Live Seven"!

107
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:17,549
Which one?

108
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:22,548
Which one but the one aired on Nichiuri TV from 7 am?

109
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:23,948
But...

110
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,248
See.

111
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:27,348
"Morning Live Seven" is also playing on cable TV

112
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:29,848
from 9 am in the morning too.

113
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,849
"Morning Live Seven."

114
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:34,449
True.

115
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:37,148
Which means...

116
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:41,348
even if it were to take an hour and a half by car from here.

117
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:44,848
He could've killed Mr. Nakamoto at a little after 7 am,

118
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:48,148
come back here, wake Officer Chiba up at 9 am

119
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:51,748
and watch "Morning Live Seven" playing on cable TV together,

120
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:54,149
it seems possible for him to establish a fake alibi.

121
00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:00,248
Chiba you said that you both drank last night

122
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:02,348
and you fell asleep in the living room, right?

123
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,448
Yes.

124
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,748
Officer Sato.

125
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:07,448
If he made Chiba drink to make him groggy in the morning,

126
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:10,248
and if Chiba who was awakened in the morning still half asleep.

127
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:13,148
He probably wouldn't have realized it if it were the cable TV program.

128
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:15,548
Wait a minute!

129
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:18,348
I could've been half asleep

130
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:20,448
but you can't trick the video, can you?

131
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:23,848
The video I recorded this morning of "Morning Live Seven" cooking corner

132
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:27,148
had the time and everything recorded too, didn't it?

133
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:29,848
If it's the "Morning Live Seven" that played on cable TV

134
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:32,048
the time wouldn't be displayed!

135
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,948
It's aired two hours later, you know.

136
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:36,148
That's true too.

137
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,848
Besides, after watching Morning Live till 8 am,

138
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:40,548
we watched a six hours video.

139
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:43,748
And like I was saying he was with me all the time

140
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:45,748
while we watched the live baseball broadcast from 2 pm,

141
00:08:45,749 --> 00:08:49,248
when Officer Chosuke and all of you came part way through the game.

142
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:50,348
The only time I wasn't with him was

143
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:53,248
when I went to take a bath for about 30 minutes.

144
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:55,048
It would've been impossible for him

145
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:58,448
to even make it to the crime scene that would've taken

146
00:08:58,449 --> 00:08:59,848
more than an hour by car.

147
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:02,948
Well, I took a bath after watching the video halfway,

148
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:04,848
I think it was about 11 am

149
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:08,448
so I think it would be impossible for him to commit the crime.

150
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:09,649
But...

151
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:15,148
There's a lot you can do with 30 minutes.

152
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:17,048
You can make coffee,

153
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:19,348
Watch TV.

154
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:21,748
Dub videos.

155
00:09:21,749 --> 00:09:23,549
Dubbing?

156
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:28,349
Right! Dubbing videos.

157
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,998
I see!

158
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:37,698
If he had set the timer to record "Morning Live Seven" before going out,

159
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:40,698
he could've dubbed it over the cable TV program

160
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:42,698
that Officer Chiba recorded!

161
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:46,798
Moreover, what he taped was "Yoko Okino's Four-minute Cooking"!

162
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,698
Since there are two decks so 30 minutes would be more than enough!

163
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:53,398
But if there's no time display,

164
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,298
I think I would have noticed when I recorded the program.

165
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:58,898
Oh, I wonder about that?

166
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:03,498
Those memo stickers that are stuck all over the TV.

167
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:08,298
If you're used to seeing those memos on the set all the time,

168
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:11,098
even if you can't see the time display on the upper left,

169
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:13,198
you would just figure

170
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:15,398
that's the reason why you can't see the time,

171
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,598
and it wouldn't even bother you, right?

172
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:18,599
You seem to have known that

173
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,398
the cooking corner was after the weather forecast

174
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,398
so you don't have to see the time to record it.

175
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,398
And, you also mentioned that the flash news about Hide

176
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,298
was displayed on the screen during "Morning Live Seven", right?

177
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,299
Yeah.

178
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,498
If the program that you were watching was really

179
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:39,698
the news variety program from 7 am,

180
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:43,198
I think they would have talked about that news during the program.

181
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:44,998
In other words, even if it's a live program if it's a recording,

182
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:48,598
new news coverage is impossible?

183
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:49,599
Chiba!

184
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,998
You said that the news on the video

185
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:53,398
wasn't mentioned in the program, right?

186
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,198
Yeah.

187
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:57,598
I think that sort of news was on display

188
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,998
when Chiba left to go to the restroom.

189
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:02,398
But, don't forget.

190
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,998
We were watching the Masked Yaiba video from 8 am for six hours!

191
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:10,798
If you include the time that Chiba was taking a bath,

192
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,198
it's six and a half hours!

193
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:14,298
If we were watching "Morning Live Seven"

194
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,398
on cable TV from 9 am to 10 am,

195
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,998
then we would've finished watching the video at 4 pm or 4:30 pm.

196
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:24,098
The live baseball broadcast was until 4 pm so it would've been finished,

197
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:28,398
and you all came here a little before 4 pm, right?

198
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,998
Now that he mentions it, that's true.

199
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:32,498
So, I wouldn't have had the time.

200
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:37,098
What time did you begin watching the Masked Yaiba video?

201
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:39,598
So, like I've been telling you! At 8 am in the morning!

202
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,999
Not you, but them!

203
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:47,298
A little before we began searching this room so...

204
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:48,998
About 4:10 pm.

205
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,298
Which means about two hours have passed since they started watching.

206
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:53,398
Right.

207
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,998
Hey, you guys.

208
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,698
What episode are you watching now?

209
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:59,399
Here goes! Secret technique Yaiba Thunder God Fist!

210
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:05,998
Hey! Tell me what episode you're watching!

211
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:08,098
The last scene of episode six!

212
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:09,598
This is the good part, you know?

213
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,398
Stop bugging us, Conan!

214
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,399
Episode six?

215
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,998
What is the meaning of this?

216
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:16,598
If the episodes are 30 minutes long,

217
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:19,098
three hours should've gone by.

218
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:20,898
-Tomorrow is another day! -Mitsuhiko!

219
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:22,298
-Go, our hero! -Hurry! The continuation!

220
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:23,299
-Masked Yaiba! -Yes, yes!

221
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,998
The next one is...

222
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:27,898
I see! The commercials!

223
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,698
It's not only the commercials...

224
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:32,798
They can't wait to watch the next episode

225
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,998
that they're skipping the opening theme song as well as the end,

226
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:39,798
preview of the next episode and the summary of the previous episode.

227
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:43,399
So, it only takes them a little more than 20 minutes to watch an episode.

228
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:46,998
Were you doing that too, Chiba?

229
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,398
Yeah. Probably.

230
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:52,698
Then, watching 12 episodes would be 240 minutes.

231
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:54,898
That's only four hours!

232
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,998
I see.

233
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:58,398
Between 9 am to 10 am,

234
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,498
if programs that were two hours delayed

235
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:04,298
followed by that video was shown to Chiba,

236
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:05,698
the discrepancy in time would be compensated,

237
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:09,798
and you'd make it for the live baseball broadcast at 2 pm.

238
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:12,598
Very smart, sonny.

239
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:15,698
Moreover, since Chiba took a bath part way,

240
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:18,498
his concept of time could've been thrown off a bit.

241
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:22,998
Even if he were to watch the baseball game from after it started,

242
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,798
he wouldn't be able to tell how much time passed,

243
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,198
so, time can be connected very conveniently!

244
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:28,598
But Chiba went to the restroom

245
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,598
and to the kitchen to get drinks too!

246
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:32,498
Didn't you look at the clock then?

247
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:36,998
Yeah. I didn't think there was anything odd going on though.

248
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:38,999
So, he must've rigged it, right?

249
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,898
Rigged?

250
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,198
The clock?

251
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,798
He rigged the clock two hours backwards before waking Officer Chiba up.

252
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,598
He moved the hands of the clock here in the living room and the kitchen.

253
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:54,398
While Officer Chiba was absorbed in watching the video,

254
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,298
Mr. Kato slowly moved the clock back to the original time, right?

255
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:59,298
I see.

256
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:02,998
The living room clock is opposite the TV,

257
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:04,498
and as for the clock in the kitchen,

258
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:06,598
if you close the door you can't see a thing,

259
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,998
so it'll be easy to move the hands of the clock!

260
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:11,898
But there are clocks in the bedroom and the front entrance too.

261
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:14,998
Officer Chiba fell asleep in this living room last night.

262
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:19,498
And when he took a bath, his change of clothes are here

263
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:21,498
so the clock in the bedroom was probably left untouched,

264
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:24,098
thinking that Officer Chiba wouldn't go there anyway.

265
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:25,798
Then, what about the clock at the front entrance?

266
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,298
He can't touch the clock at the front entrance!

267
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,898
When the courier comes at the specified time,

268
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,298
and the time on the clock is not right, it'll be odd!

269
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:35,498
I see.

270
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,898
I'm pretty sure that Mr. Kato made sure that

271
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:39,498
when somebody came to the door,

272
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:44,198
he would answer it in place of Officer Chiba.

273
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:48,098
Come to think of it, when we got here you...

274
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:50,898
Hey, kid! Where do you have such proof?

275
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,998
Why don't you ask Officer Chiba, then?

276
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:55,099
What?

277
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,598
Kato.

278
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:02,698
The clocks in this house were all set five minutes early.

279
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,599
So that I wouldn't over sleep.

280
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:07,898
I just went to check

281
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:10,398
but only the clock in the living room and the kitchen

282
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,799
had been returned to the original time by someone.

283
00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:18,698
Kato! You're the only one who could've...

284
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:20,398
You gotta be kidding!

285
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,398
I'm called a killer just because your clocks were delayed!

286
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,698
If you suspect me, show me proof that I killed the guy!

287
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:31,998
I'm sure that it can be found on the way here.

288
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,898
It's been found!

289
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:36,099
Just now.

290
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:39,598
Between the scene of the crime and here,

291
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:41,398
at the bottom of the Teimuzu River,

292
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,398
the black knapsack was found with a weight tied on it.

293
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,598
Inside it were a blood smeared shirt and slacks

294
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:50,398
as well as a parka smeared with blood on the inside,

295
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,798
which he seems to have been wearing on top of shirt.

296
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:57,198
Moreover, here and there on the knapsack,

297
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,198
there seemed to be blackened red fingerprints

298
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:03,498
which probably got on there when he took off his shirt

299
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:06,398
that was splattered with the blood of the victim.

300
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,299
And, of course, you know who those fingerprints belong to, don't you?

301
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,398
Well, it seems that the car you rented last night

302
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,798
was also found at a nearby parking lot,

303
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:22,198
so we'll check it out later too.

304
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:23,898
That's a problem.

305
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,198
As for those red fingerprints,

306
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,698
I was going to wipe them off clean later,

307
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:30,898
that they're still all over the car.

308
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,598
So, it was you, after all!

309
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:35,398
You used me?

310
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,298
You deceived me to establish your alibi.

311
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:41,098
Yeah. I figured since you're a cop,

312
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:44,098
the police would believe your testimony.

313
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:45,898
Kato, how dare you!

314
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,298
Sorry. I couldn't think of any other way

315
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:53,198
to let out my anger of having my girl taken away.

316
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,098
I knew that my girl's feelings for me had faded

317
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:58,698
while I was abroad on my business trip

318
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:00,298
so I wasn't all that shocked

319
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,498
when I heard that she was getting married to Nakamoto.

320
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:06,098
But, I couldn't take it when I went to give him a piece of my mind

321
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:08,498
and I was shown the letters and postcards that I had sent.

322
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:12,298
He had the nerve to say, "What a push over",

323
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,598
while grinning as he threw them at me.

324
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,898
All the postcards and unopened letters

325
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:19,198
that I had written while I was abroad.

326
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,398
So, he probably kept them from her even

327
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:23,898
before she could read them.

328
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:29,198
That's what made me lose my temper.

329
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,398
I was so furious

330
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:32,798
that I didn't even notice all the clocks here

331
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,298
were set five minutes earlier.

332
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:39,898
The sneakers that you saw inside the shoe cabinet?

333
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:41,098
Yeah.

334
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:43,798
The seams of the shoe strings were damp

335
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,098
while all the other shoes were clean and dry.

336
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,798
Wouldn't you think it's strange?

337
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,898
If he washed it, he would've removed the shoe strings at least, right?

338
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:55,298
So, that's how you figured the killer was Mr. Kato!

339
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:57,698
That he hastily dried his shoes with a dryer

340
00:17:57,699 --> 00:18:01,898
after he washed the mud from the rain off his shoes.

341
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:02,899
Right!

342
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,098
And after that I dispatched investigators to places

343
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:07,898
between here and the scene of the crime

344
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:11,098
where he may have thrown the black knapsack away.

345
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:12,998
I did it all after I confirmed that Chiba wasn't lying

346
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:15,898
to protect his friend.

347
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:17,598
I didn't want to think that way,

348
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,098
but if Chiba were an accomplice,

349
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,698
they would've thrown the stuff away somewhere farther.

350
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:24,399
What do you mean?

351
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:29,698
Then you suspected Officer Chiba too?

352
00:18:29,699 --> 00:18:30,998
Yeah!

353
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:33,998
A police officer is a crummy job

354
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:37,998
where you have to suspect even the nicest people.

355
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:39,298
I'll bet Officer Chiba who is facing that man

356
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,398
in the interrogation room right now

357
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:44,099
is taking the blow right now.

358
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,998
See you.

359
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:50,098
I'll leave the rest up to you.

360
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:53,099
Yes, sir. We'll take the children home.

361
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,298
I get to sit in the front seat!

362
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,798
What again? That's not fair!

363
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,098
Genta! You should let us sit in the passenger's seat sometimes too!

364
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:11,498
Come... Don't fight and hurry inside!

365
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:12,998
Okay, it's stone-paper-scissors!

366
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:14,398
Conan, come here please!

367
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:15,399
Never mind him!

368
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,398
Right!

369
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:18,798
Police officer.

370
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,298
A police officer is a crummy job

371
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:23,198
where you have to suspect even the nicest people.

372
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:25,998
Officer Sato, aren't you going to doubt me?

373
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,898
I'm going to Tottori, you know?

374
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:34,198
I might be hit on by some cute co-worker.

375
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:35,898
If you really like me...

376
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:39,098
If you even have a tinge of feeling for me.

377
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:41,098
Hey! Come on, get in.

378
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:44,599
You could at least show a tinge of anxiety or something.

379
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,698
Officer Sato.

380
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:56,698
Who is it? Who's the one that played a prank like this?

381
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:58,398
-How terrible! -Gosh.

382
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:01,898
This is a challenge to the police!

383
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:04,599
Oh, no, that's what Officer Sato did herself.

384
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,698
What?

385
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:10,298
You mean she's a bit concerned?

386
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:11,698
No way.

387
00:20:11,699 --> 00:20:13,999
You won't, right?

388
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:19,998
Cheat on me...

389
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:22,799
What? Of course not.

390
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,298
Even if a super cute mini skirt police woman

391
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:29,498
or a sexy actress comes to the station as one day chief of police?

392
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:30,799
You really won't?

393
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,099
Officer Sato.

394
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:44,098
I'll go over there and become a fine police officer!

395
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:45,298
So...

396
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:49,398
So, before I go...

397
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:54,398
Please...

398
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,498
Engage...

399
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:57,898
Where are you going?

400
00:20:57,899 --> 00:20:58,999
What?

401
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:02,798
Inspector Megure.

402
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,799
Sergeant Matsumoto.

403
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,299
What?

404
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:40,998
What?

405
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:44,198
Officer Chosuke's going to Tottori?

406
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:45,698
Not me?

407
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,198
You idiot!

408
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,998
We can't dispatch a greenhorn like you to another prefecture!

409
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:53,398
He's going as a representative of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police after all.

410
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:56,498
But Inspector, didn't you called me at home this morning?

411
00:22:56,499 --> 00:22:59,998
Sorry! His name is Chosuke Takagi!

412
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:02,799
Since you both have the same last name, I made a mistake.

413
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:07,398
Officer Chosuke's last name is Takagi?

414
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:08,999
Gosh... That Yumi!

415
00:23:13,699 --> 00:23:17,398
Oh, no? I wonder if somebody's talking about me?

416
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:19,598
Take care of the children, okay?

417
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,798
Be careful taking them home!

418
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,299
Yes, sir.

419
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:26,098
And?

420
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:27,298
Do what with you?

421
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:30,498
Oh, well, you see.

422
00:23:30,499 --> 00:23:33,599
Please be...

423
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:41,898
Right!

424
00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:43,398
Before heading home, let's go to Karaoke.

425
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:44,798
Oh, sounds good!

426
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,799
Karaoke?

427
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,998
Aye!

428
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:48,099
Let's! Let's!

429
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:51,198
-"Masked Yaiba" -"Masked Yaiba".

430
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:52,599
Would you like something to drink?

431
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:54,999
What a day.

432
00:23:57,699 --> 00:24:00,598
"Next Episode" -What on earth was he waiting for?

433
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:02,198
What?

434
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:04,898
-What? -What? 110 cm?

435
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:07,298
Isn't that the height of a child?

436
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:12,098
But, how could he do something like that?

437
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:14,098
The thing that you waited for five hours

438
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:16,798
in Mr. Kitamura's president's room

439
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:17,799
was...

440
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:27,799
Next Conan, "Mysterious 20 cm Height Discrepancy".

441
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,198
Next Conan's Hint:

442
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:47,798
"Chandelier."

443
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:48,799
The next episode has to do with height.

444
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,599
In our case, it's more a problem of discrepancy of weight than height.
