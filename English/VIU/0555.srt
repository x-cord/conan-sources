1
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:04,283
Ran's whereabouts became unknown at Kinosaki hot spring

2
00:00:04,283 --> 00:00:07,483
that we went to treat my foot that I sprained.

3
00:00:07,483 --> 00:00:08,683
"Koichi Yumoto (28), Freelance Writer."

4
00:00:08,683 --> 00:00:10,683
From the pictures that Mitsuhiko and the others took,

5
00:00:10,683 --> 00:00:14,621
we were able to figure out that Ran was accompanying a little girl.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,260
In that same picture, there was a silhouette of

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,460
a suspicious looking figure following their tracks too.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,360
We are told by Heiji Hattori who we coincidentally run into

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,860
that the girl is Haruna Tabuse

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,560
that he had been asked to search for.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,260
"Haruna Tabuse (8), daughter of the president of a restaurant franchise."

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,260
The day before, a sculpture called...

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,460
"Shuhei Tabuse (42)" -the "Rainbow Child" was stolen

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,760
from the art museum that Haruna's father owns,

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,060
and Haruna disappeared along with it.

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,560
We learn from Dolphin Trainer Yui, an acquaintance of Haruna,

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,260
that the sculptor of the "Rainbow Child"

18
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,260
is actually Haruna's mother who is living apart from her now.

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,260
Using the letter from her mother as a clue,

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,860
we pursued our search for the two girls.

21
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,460
But, at about the same time...

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,860
Miss!

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,260
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

Click Conan on Saturday at 18:00.

Ran's whereabouts and the truth of the case.

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,560
There's a great deduction tag with Heiji.

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,060
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,860
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,260
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

"Stork Mystery Tour (Pursuing Haruna)"

31
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:11,591
"Toyooka Central Hospital."

32
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:24,691
At the ropeway station at the top of the mountain,

33
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:28,891
Heiji and Pops discover Haruna who is unconscious

34
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:31,091
but Ran was nowhere in sight,

35
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,991
nor was the suspicious man found.

36
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,491
Sorry, Ran.

37
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:39,091
If I could only move the way I wanted to...

38
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:41,791
We went to the police over here just in case.

39
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,391
Mr. Tabuse and the others went to the hospital.

40
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,691
I see.

41
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:47,091
I'm sorry this happened despite me being there.

42
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:51,291
Don't be. I should've realized earlier myself.

43
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,791
The reason Haruna didn't go to

44
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,291
the Kinosaki Literary Art Museum was probably

45
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,191
because of the letter from her mother that had written,

46
00:03:59,191 --> 00:04:03,191
"I ran into my best friend at Kinosaki Literary Art Museum,"

47
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:06,291
but she couldn't read the words "Kinosaki Literary Art Museum".

48
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,291
But she was able to read the word "straw".

49
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,491
So she used that as a hint

50
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:13,691
and headed for the Kinosaki Traditional Straw Craft Museum.

51
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:16,691
She went to the ropeway station at the top of the mountain

52
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,691
for the same reason too.

53
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,991
Haruna could only read the word "station"

54
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:23,291
of the "Kinosaki Hot Spring Station" that was written.

55
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,591
So she put the work "mountain" that was written nearby together,

56
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:29,391
and thought it read mountain top station.

57
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:31,891
We were staking out at Kinosaki Hot Spring Station,

58
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:35,191
so were late getting to the mountain top station.

59
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:39,491
I tell you children do things that you can't figure out.

60
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:43,491
Heiji, nothing was in Haruna's knapsack was there?

61
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,091
No, but it's hard to believe that

62
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:48,291
the culprit got hold of the "Rainbow Child" either.

63
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,891
Yeah. If so, he wouldn't have had to kidnap Ran.

64
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,791
Haruna probably hid the "Rainbow Child" somewhere.

65
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,991
So, it's most likely that Haruna's the one

66
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,691
who took the "Rainbow Child" from the museum.

67
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:05,191
"Toyooka Central Hospital."

68
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:08,991
"Natsuho Handa (35), sculptor and Haruna's mother."

69
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,991
What brings you here?

70
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:15,791
I'm good friends with the hospital head here,

71
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,391
so he let me know.

72
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:18,991
How's Haruna?

73
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,191
I took the "Rainbow Child"?

74
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:23,691
Don't be ridiculous!

75
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,591
I would never do something like that!

76
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,891
Please be quiet.

77
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:30,591
This is a hospital, you know.

78
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,291
Where were you all this time?

79
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,091
At Michiko's...

80
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:39,591
Mother.

81
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:42,491
At any rate, I want the "Rainbow Child" back!

82
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:44,891
That belongs to our art museum!

83
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:48,191
I just told you I didn't take it!

84
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:50,091
Please cut it out!

85
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:53,391
Shut up! It's none of your business!

86
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:54,791
It sure is my business!

87
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:58,291
My daughter got messed up in this too, you know?

88
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,791
Just what do you mean?

89
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:03,391
Would you tell me a little about what happened?

90
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,591
It can't be...

91
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:12,391
Shoots!

92
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:21,891
Please! Wait, Haruna!

93
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:24,091
Gee, you still insist on following me?

94
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:26,491
I switched off the phone like you told me too,

95
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:28,691
and won't tell anybody about you.

96
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:30,391
I'll take you home,

97
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:33,091
so let's go home to where your mom and dad are.

98
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:35,691
There's nobody at home.

99
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:36,991
Huh?

100
00:06:36,991 --> 00:06:40,591
Mother got divorced and left leaving me behind!

101
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:45,291
Dad is all work day after day too

102
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,191
and probably doesn't care at all about me.

103
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:50,891
I see. As for me,

104
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:53,691
my mother and father has been living away from each other

105
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:56,591
-since I was little, you see. -Huh?

106
00:06:56,591 --> 00:07:01,491
I think I kind of understand a little of how you feel, Haruna.

107
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:03,491
So...

108
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:06,091
So, if you don't do as I say,

109
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:08,391
this lady here is going to get it.

110
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:11,291
Ran.

111
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,591
Bingo! Haruna's moving!

112
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:21,591
Okay! Heiji, I'm counting on you, so don't lose her!

113
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:24,991
If the culprit kidnapped Ran

114
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:27,391
because he couldn't get hold of the "Rainbow Child",

115
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:30,691
Haruna will sure move just as the culprit tells her to!

116
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:32,691
Just as we deduced!

117
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:37,291
She seems to have seen us!

118
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,791
Driver.

119
00:07:51,391 --> 00:07:53,291
It's starting to look like work for we,

120
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,191
the Youth Detective Squad, isn't it?

121
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,991
We'll rescue Ran!

122
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:01,891
Huh?

123
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:04,291
My badge is gone! I don't have it!

124
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,191
Maybe you dropped it at the hot spring?

125
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:07,991
What? Oh, no!

126
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:13,691
Somebody... Somebody help me!

127
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,391
This... Ayumi dropped it.

128
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:27,091
The Youth Detective Squad badge.

129
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:33,191
-My badge... -Who is it from?

130
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:34,791
It's Conan?

131
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,691
Maybe it's my badge?

132
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:40,491
Wait!

133
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:42,191
I hear something.

134
00:08:42,191 --> 00:08:45,091
The sound of drums is heard from the badge?

135
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,891
Maybe it's Ran.

136
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:50,591
Right! If I remember correctly...

137
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,591
13:00... This is it!

138
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:58,391
Mirage!

139
00:08:58,391 --> 00:09:02,191
"Mirage" -They sound the drums to tell time at 13:00!

140
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:05,691
Ran is probably in Izushi!

141
00:09:05,691 --> 00:09:07,591
"Izushi."

142
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,591
Mother and child stone statue?

143
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:55,491
Haruna went to pray there?

144
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:58,991
Yeah, I don't know what you really call it,

145
00:09:58,991 --> 00:10:01,191
but it's a shabby looking old stone statue

146
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:04,591
and it's carrying a baby in its arms.

147
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:06,491
At Kinosaki, Haruna was praying to

148
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:08,291
the goddess of child birth and children.

149
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:14,391
And at the mountain top ropeway station

150
00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:16,491
is the Benevolent Mother Guyanin.

151
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:20,091
And this time, it's the stone statue of mother and child.

152
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:21,891
Could it be that...

153
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:27,591
It seems that you're thinking the same thing I am too, Kudo.

154
00:10:27,591 --> 00:10:31,691
Yeah. Then Haruna's purpose is...

155
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:34,291
Just what're they talking about?

156
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:38,891
"Sukyo Temple."

157
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:44,791
"Izushi Meiji Museum."

158
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,391
"Izushi Chief Retainer's House."

159
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:58,891
"Playhouse."

160
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:08,691
Shoots!

161
00:11:08,691 --> 00:11:10,691
-Go around the back! -Okay!

162
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:12,391
You lost her?

163
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:15,391
What? Just what do you guys think you're doing?

164
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:17,591
Pops, calm down!

165
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,991
Those stone stairs were really tough as expected, weren't they?

166
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:26,191
Really!

167
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:28,691
My calves are all swollen.

168
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:31,291
I wonder how many steps those stairs have?

169
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,791
Hey, look, look.

170
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:37,191
It says the place we just went to is called "Gonbei-san"!

171
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:38,491
Gonbei?

172
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:39,991
How interesting.

173
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,391
Gonbei-san?

174
00:11:41,391 --> 00:11:44,091
What is it? Do you hear something?

175
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:47,591
Do you want to go to Gonbei-san?

176
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:51,091
-Driver, do you know Gonbei-san? -Yes.

177
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:54,291
-Please take us there! -Sure.

178
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,691
Ran, hang on!

179
00:12:01,591 --> 00:12:04,391
I see! This is it!

180
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:08,391
I've finally figured out the truth of this case!

181
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,970
"Izushi Castle Ruins"

182
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,170
I can't go any farther.

183
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,870
I'm starved and can't move.

184
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,370
You two are have no guts!

185
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,070
"Kannoden."

186
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,570
This is Kannoden!

187
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,670
Why is this called Gonbei-san?

188
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,870
That's because this Kannoden is dedicated to

189
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:41,570
an ancient Izushi feudal lord named Gonbei Hidehisa.

190
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,070
That's why it's called Gonbei-san.

191
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,570
Maybe that detective agency daughter is somewhere nearby.

192
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,270
Shoots!

193
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,770
What's with her?

194
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,270
It's those women again?

195
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,770
What is it?

196
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,370
Move out of the way, please!

197
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,070
-Move out of the way! -Just what do you think you're doing?

198
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,670
Get in!

199
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,270
-Where's Ran? -Hurry!

200
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,170
He got away!

201
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,170
After that car!

202
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,470
Move! Move out of the way, please!

203
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,870
I've got no choice but to go!

204
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,070
Hey!

205
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,670
I won't let you get away!

206
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,970
Where's the brat...

207
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,170
Where'd he go?

208
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,470
"Michiko Sagara (35), straw craft craftsman."

209
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,070
Aunty!

210
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,770
Haruna?

211
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,770
Aunty!

212
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,070
You've got the thing that mother asked you to keep for her, right?

213
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,270
From Natsuho?

214
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,170
You mean this?

215
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,270
I finally found it!

216
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,270
-Were you looking for this? -Yep!

217
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,570
What's that?

218
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,170
I told you to take me where the "Rainbow Child" was!

219
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,870
Just who are you?

220
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,370
You can't separate them!

221
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,370
If you're going to take it away,

222
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,570
I want you to take this one with it, too!

223
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,870
What is she talking about?

224
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,170
Exactly what she just said.

225
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,570
You're...

226
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,770
Haruna, you were looking for it all this time, weren't you?

227
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,770
I'll bet it's a pair with the "Rainbow Child" statue?

228
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,770
Who are you?

229
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,770
Conan Edogawa.

230
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,370
A detective.

231
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,270
A detective? You've gotta be kidding!

232
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,170
Michiko, I'm taking a break...

233
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,870
Yui!

234
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,070
Wait!

235
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,770
I finally found you!

236
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,570
Sorry, we took a while.

237
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,670
Ran, are you okay?

238
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,070
Darn it! Let me go!

239
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:02,070
Let go! You brat! Let me go!

240
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,670
Conan!

241
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,670
Darn it!

242
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,770
Oh no!

243
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,870
Hold it!

244
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,970
Are you all right, Conan?

245
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,970
Yep. Ran, how about you?

246
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,670
Yep, I'm fine!

247
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,970
I guess you are.

248
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,770
Ran...

249
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,970
Dad!

250
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,870
Ran! Are you all right? You're not hurt, are you?

251
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,170
Yep.

252
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,970
I'm glad! I'm really glad!

253
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,770
Dad.

254
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,970
Don't cry.

255
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,070
What's going on?

256
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,270
Ko-chan?

257
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,870
Ko-chan, just what do you think you're doing?

258
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,770
I mean, I was looking for you all this time!

259
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,470
Hey! Say something, will you?

260
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,170
Ko-chan...

261
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,670
I'm very sorry!

262
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,670
I'm sorry for trouble he caused!

263
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,570
You're so stupid!

264
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,870
How can you do something like this,

265
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,270
be it that you have to pay back debts!

266
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,170
I'm sorry, Yui.

267
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,670
He may be stupid, but he's not a bad guy!

268
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:21,570
So, please let him go, just this time! Please!

269
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:25,170
Why'd you do something like this?

270
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,070
The fact is, I was asked to do this.

271
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,970
Mr. Mouri refused to let me have a close up interview with him,

272
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,270
and I was at a loss what to do.

273
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,370
That person you're talking about, isn't it Mr. Kamaike?

274
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,870
Huh? How do you know?

275
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,070
Mr. Kamaike? You mean the head of the museum?

276
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:50,170
Isn't it about time you come out? Mr. Kamaike!

277
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,870
I don't know what you're talking about.

278
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,470
Mr. Kamaike!

279
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:00,370
I had Mr. Yumoto write an article about the museum.

280
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,170
But I just happened to pass by here.

281
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,570
Mr. Kamaike.

282
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,170
The man in this picture isn't Mr. Yumoto!

283
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,170
Because Mr. Yumoto was doing a close up interview of Pops at that time.

284
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,970
This is you, right?

285
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,070
Stop making ridiculous stories up!

286
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,570
Mr. Kamaike, I'll bet you knew about it

287
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,970
from the materials in the reference museum or something.

288
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,370
That there was a statue of a mother

289
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,770
that was to paired with the "Rainbow Child."

290
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,970
And, also that Haruna was trying to bring together

291
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,370
the "Rainbow Child" statue with that of the mother statue.

292
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,170
So you deliberately made it easy for her to steal the statue

293
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,270
when you re-decorated the exhibited items.

294
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,870
You lured Haruna into stealing the "Rainbow Child" statue.

295
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,070
Then you followed Haruna

296
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,470
and found the statue of the mother.

297
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,470
But when Pops came together with Heiji,

298
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,370
you got flustered, right?

299
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,970
So, he tried to get you, Mr. Yumoto

300
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,570
to at least get a hold of the "Rainbow Children".

301
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,770
Right! But Haruna didn't have the "Rainbow Child".

302
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,370
And that's why I kidnapped that girl.

303
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,370
Will you cut it out?

304
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,270
Or, do you have some kind of evidence or something?

305
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,270
What's that stain on your slacks?

306
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,170
What about this?

307
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,270
Genta, you bumped into the man wearing sunglasses, right?

308
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,370
Yeah.

309
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,670
He's the one who spoiled my crab ice!

310
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,470
What about it?

311
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,670
Mitsuhiko, your badge is so dirty.

312
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,870
Yeah, the ice melted and spilled.

313
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,370
That stain, maybe it's...

314
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,170
What?

315
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,970
That's indeed the smell of my crab ice!

316
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,770
Perfect match!

317
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,070
In other words, it means that

318
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,570
you're the man wearing sunglasses that bumped into him!

319
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,370
Admit it already.

320
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,470
I embezzled money from the art museum and used it.

321
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,270
So I was planning to sell off the "Rainbow Child"

322
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,370
and the "Mother" statue that was still not made public

323
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,370
and get rid of the deficit!

324
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,370
The "Rainbow Child" statue was hidden

325
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,870
in the coin locker of Kinosaki Hot Spring Station

326
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,470
from the time Haruna had come to Kinosaki.

327
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,970
How nice!

328
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,670
It's fantastic!

329
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,570
You can say that again.

330
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,470
-How splendid! -Yep!

331
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,670
You go and tell her things you don't have to,

332
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,170
that's why she ends up doing something like this!

333
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,370
Speak for yourself.

334
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,170
You don't take care of her like you should, that's why...

335
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,270
What? You're to blame for leaving home capriciously!

336
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,170
That's because you never listen to what I have to say!

337
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,670
Please stop!

338
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,570
Don't you still see

339
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,370
why Haruna took the "Rainbow Child"?

340
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,170
She was lonely

341
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,070
because she was living away from her mother

342
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,870
and her father was busy with work everyday.

343
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,570
That's why she thought that by bringing the two statues together,

344
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,170
she could maybe bring her separated family back together again.

345
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,270
That's what she was thinking

346
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,870
while carrying the "Rainbow Child" around!

347
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,470
It's almost like...

348
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:25,470
Almost like a stork that brings along happiness.

349
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,470
Mommy! Daddy!

350
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,070
Haruna!

351
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,470
Haruna!

352
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,770
I'm sorry, Haruna!

353
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,170
Haruna!

354
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,370
Mommy...

355
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,270
Mommy!

356
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,370
Haruna, I'm sorry!

357
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,270
Daddy!

358
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,070
Daddy! Mommy!

359
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,170
Haruna.

360
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,070
"Misato Park of the Storks."

361
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,170
Hey, look! Daddy! Mommy!

362
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,370
They are so many of them!

363
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,770
I wish we'd be like that one day, too.

364
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,070
They're flying off!

365
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,570
"Next Episode."

366
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,170
No good! They won't make it!

367
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:07,670
The two cars we saw at the convenience store are both ruined.

368
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:11,370
The front part of this car is reinforced by a grill guard.

369
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:16,070
Come on, stop going here and there, Dad will scold you!

370
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,770
So, the case is closed!

371
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,070
I'm counting on you, Ran.

372
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:30,670
Next Conan, "The Intersection of Fear".

373
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:45,084
Next Conan's Hint:

374
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,984
"Rainbow."

375
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:48,884
What? It's going to be aired at 18:00 on Saturday?

376
00:24:48,884 --> 00:24:50,984
I mean, "rainbow".
