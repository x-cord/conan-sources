1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,400
One moment please.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,800
But, Haruka. It's amazing you got a hold of the ticket

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,600
for the Black Roses Live.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,400
It was a present from him.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,100
What? You mean that nameless guitarist?

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,400
Yep. The day is his birthday, you see!

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,800
And he says he wants me to celebrate it with him.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,400
I see. It's surprising how he came up with the cash.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,900
Thank you for waiting.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,800
I clicked at exactly 10:00 sharp, but couldn't get through.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,600
I'm sorry, Sonoko.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,400
See, I told you, didn't I?

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,900
That's it's going to be horrendous trying to get tickets

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,100
being that it's going to be their one and only Japan tour.

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,700
At times like this, the only way is

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,500
to go directly to the store and get in line.

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,000
Sonoko, don't tell me that that's...

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,200
2 arena seat tickets to the Black Roses Tokyo Live.

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,000
I had a tough time trying to get them, you know.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,100
It's gone!

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,100
I'm sure I put it in here.

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,100
Who is it? That stole my ticket?

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,700
Wrong! I got this ticket.

24
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,700
Thief!

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,200
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,200
are slashed by the light of deduction.

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,700
An incident occurs at a coffee shop.

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,400
Beware of rare tickets!

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,100
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,100
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,800
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:15,136
"The Platinum Ticket Commotion"

33
00:03:15,536 --> 00:03:16,836
"The next day"

34
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:19,436
I was taken to the police box on the corner after that

35
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:22,736
and until my innocence was proven, it took 3 hours! 3 hours!

36
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:29,636
But she have a note of her seat number on the ticket?

37
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:33,236
But she said it was one that her boyfriend got hold of from a friend,

38
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:35,136
so she had no record of it at all.

39
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:36,836
I tell you, really, it's so infuriating!

40
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:40,436
I got in line and stood overnight from Saturday.

41
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:42,436
Excuse me.

42
00:03:42,436 --> 00:03:45,236
I would like an XL size cafe latte,

43
00:03:45,236 --> 00:03:48,036
with an addition of vanilla ice cream and caramel syrup to go with it,

44
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:51,036
and chocolate chip topping with just a little ice.

45
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:54,536
An X large size cafe latte with vanilla ice cream,

46
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:57,336
caramel syrup and chocolate chip topping to go with it.

47
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:59,136
And you just want a little ice.

48
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:02,636
Hey, Sonoko. Hold it down a bit, girl.

49
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,336
It's okay. It's on the house today,

50
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:09,436
so order to your heart's content.

51
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:13,236
Welcome.

52
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:17,636
Conan, it's her.

53
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:21,636
The one who called us thief yesterday, Haruka Kona.

54
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:26,236
Excuse me. We're sorry about yesterday.

55
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:29,636
Please take a look at this!

56
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:33,936
Last night after this shop had closed,

57
00:04:33,936 --> 00:04:36,036
this ticket for the live was put on auction

58
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:38,636
from an internet auction site!

59
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:40,936
No joke! 50,000 yen per ticket?

60
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:44,036
The price sky-rocketed to 5 times the original in one night!

61
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:45,636
Not only the price,

62
00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:47,836
but also the handle name of the exhibitor.

63
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:49,736
Coffee Rumba?

64
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:52,336
It sure sounds like a name

65
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:54,636
that a coffee shop employee would use, don't you think?

66
00:04:54,636 --> 00:04:58,036
Don't tell me that one of our employees is the culprit?

67
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:00,236
Aren't you just kind of picking a fight?

68
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:02,336
At any rate, I'd like to talk to the people

69
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:05,836
who were at this shop last night.

70
00:05:05,836 --> 00:05:08,036
The people who were at the shop last night

71
00:05:08,036 --> 00:05:12,636
were me and Kosuda who was passing out cake freebies,

72
00:05:12,636 --> 00:05:16,336
and the cashier, Masako Moka.

73
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:20,036
Please call her over here, too!

74
00:05:22,436 --> 00:05:25,436
The fact is, she's hasn't shown up yet today.

75
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:33,836
No good.

76
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:36,436
She's not answering no matter how many times I call.

77
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,236
It seems that she hasn't attended her university classes either.

78
00:05:39,236 --> 00:05:40,836
Maybe something came up?

79
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:43,636
Is she your friend?

80
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:46,436
Yes, we're classmates at the university.

81
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:50,636
She was supposed to work the shift after me today.

82
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:54,436
True. She should've been here some time ago, already.

83
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:57,436
Shall I go check on her on my way home?

84
00:05:57,436 --> 00:05:59,736
-Will you do that? -Yes, sir.

85
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:02,036
Wait. If so, I'll go with you too.

86
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:04,236
We'll tag along with you too, then.

87
00:06:04,236 --> 00:06:06,636
-Right? -Yeah.

88
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:17,536
Masako.

89
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:20,336
Masako. Aren't you home?

90
00:06:23,336 --> 00:06:25,136
It's open.

91
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:29,236
Masako?

92
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,336
Conan!

93
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:49,936
No good. She's already dead.

94
00:06:49,936 --> 00:06:52,936
Ran, call the police, please.

95
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:54,636
Okay!

96
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:10,836
This is...

97
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:12,336
an auction site.

98
00:07:12,336 --> 00:07:14,536
Which means that it was her after all.

99
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:20,936
Manager!

100
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:23,036
What's the meaning of this?

101
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:25,136
You are?

102
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:26,936
I'm the store manager of the coffee shop

103
00:07:26,936 --> 00:07:31,136
that Ms. Moka works for, Jiro Kirima.

104
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:32,436
I see.

105
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:36,336
Please tell me what Ms. Moka was doing last night.

106
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:39,436
Yes, sir. Ms. Moka was working the late shift

107
00:07:39,436 --> 00:07:42,636
and they worked together until 21:00.

108
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:45,736
After quickly cleaning the shop,

109
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:48,036
we changed and left the shop.

110
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:50,636
I think at around 21:15.

111
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,836
It takes about 30 minutes from the shop to here,

112
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:58,836
so she probably got home at around 21:45.

113
00:07:58,836 --> 00:08:00,436
And 30 minutes later,

114
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:04,236
the ticket was placed on the auction site.

115
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:07,436
Inspector. According to Mr. Uruma who lives next door,

116
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:09,836
it seems that she was washing clothes

117
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:11,436
between 22:20 to 23:00 last night.

118
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:14,236
What?

119
00:08:14,236 --> 00:08:17,136
Does she always wash clothes at that time of day?

120
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:20,436
Yeah. She vacuums her room late at night

121
00:08:20,436 --> 00:08:22,436
as well as bring her boyfriend around, too.

122
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:24,636
She delays paying the rent a lot, too.

123
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:27,036
She was a sloppy woman.

124
00:08:27,036 --> 00:08:28,636
I see.

125
00:08:28,636 --> 00:08:30,136
If she had 40 minutes,

126
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:32,536
she would've finished washing clothes, no?

127
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:34,836
May I take a look?

128
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:36,436
No, Conan.

129
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:38,936
You shouldn't look in on women's clothes.

130
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,436
Okay.

131
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:46,236
Inspector, the wash is still in here after being wrung.

132
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:51,136
Moreover, from the fact that the bag was near the corpse on the floor,

133
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:53,836
it seems that the victim was planning to go out somewhere

134
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:55,836
while the washing machine was still running.

135
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,736
That's when she ran into the thief

136
00:08:57,736 --> 00:09:01,136
that broke into her place was killed.

137
00:09:01,136 --> 00:09:04,136
-But, isn't that strange? -Huh?

138
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:06,236
Because if the washing machine is running,

139
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:09,736
wouldn't it be natural to think that somebody's home?

140
00:09:09,736 --> 00:09:12,636
I see. That's true.

141
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,936
I'm sure that after running the washing machine,

142
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:19,536
she was planning to go to a convenience store nearby and left.

143
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:21,636
But she realized right away that she had forgotten something

144
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:23,136
and came home.

145
00:09:23,136 --> 00:09:25,636
That's where she ran into the culprit.

146
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,536
But, what did she forget?

147
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:33,436
Most probably the deposit slip

148
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:36,036
to pay for her gas bill that was on the table.

149
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:40,636
The payment deadline is last night.

150
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:43,636
It could be just as Conan had said.

151
00:09:43,636 --> 00:09:44,636
Yes.

152
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:47,436
The culprit, after murdering the victim

153
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:49,636
pulled the bills out of the wallet,

154
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:52,736
took the ticket and fled.

155
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:57,536
So, the culprit knew that the ticket was premium?

156
00:09:57,536 --> 00:10:01,236
Which means that you may have been in danger too, Sonoko.

157
00:10:01,236 --> 00:10:03,136
But if I were the thief,

158
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,236
I would go for the laptop first of all.

159
00:10:08,236 --> 00:10:11,136
And more so, Pops was saying

160
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:14,536
that professional thieves, in order to work effectively,

161
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:18,236
would open drawers in order from the bottom up.

162
00:10:18,236 --> 00:10:21,236
But these drawers aren't opened that way.

163
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:22,636
Then, it's also likely that

164
00:10:22,636 --> 00:10:25,636
the culprit tried to make it look like the work of a thief?

165
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:29,136
First of all, let's start by

166
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:30,936
checking on the acquaintances of the victim, shall we?

167
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:33,436
What? Ms. Moka's boyfriend?

168
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:36,836
Yes. Do you remember what kind of man he was?

169
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:41,736
The thing is, I've never met him personally.

170
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:45,936
Store manager.

171
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,936
I think it's better for you to tell the police the truth.

172
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:53,236
What the? What should I tell them, sonny?

173
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:57,036
You were the one going with the lady who died, right?

174
00:10:58,236 --> 00:11:01,636
Because on your cell phone, you had her name registered

175
00:11:01,636 --> 00:11:05,236
not by her full name, but as "Masa-chan."

176
00:11:07,036 --> 00:11:09,836
Besides even on the shift chart back at the shop,

177
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,936
both of you had days off on the same days, right?

178
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:16,336
I saw it.

179
00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:19,036
Is what he just said true?

180
00:11:21,036 --> 00:11:24,336
To be honest, I've been going with her since two months ago.

181
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:27,736
You have a spare key, don't you?

182
00:11:27,736 --> 00:11:30,036
Yes.

183
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:34,036
I see. If you have the spare key,

184
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:36,736
it would've been easy for you to enter the room

185
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:39,136
after confirming that she had gone out, wouldn't it?

186
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:40,836
No.

187
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:44,836
Then, please tell me what you were doing last night.

188
00:11:44,836 --> 00:11:48,136
Yesterday, after closing the shop,

189
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:50,436
I was placing orders for stationeries and odds and ends

190
00:11:50,436 --> 00:11:52,736
to be used at the shop, then left,

191
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:55,636
so it must've been around a little before 22:00.

192
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:57,736
It's true that if they were going with each other,

193
00:11:57,736 --> 00:12:01,036
they could've easily gotten into a fight over emotional differences.

194
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:05,636
Besides, Masako was trying to resell a customer's ticket.

195
00:12:06,236 --> 00:12:07,936
It's highly probable that she got into a fight

196
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,336
with Mr. Kirima who is the store manager.

197
00:12:11,336 --> 00:12:14,936
But what is it? Something just doesn't feel right.

198
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:21,436
And where and what were you doing between 22:20 and 23:00?

199
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:23,636
I see.

200
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:28,536
Sir. How come you remember so accurately

201
00:12:28,536 --> 00:12:31,736
the time that the washing machine was running?

202
00:12:31,736 --> 00:12:34,736
It was rattling and making a lot of noise.

203
00:12:34,736 --> 00:12:37,536
After about 5 minutes it stopped once,

204
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:40,336
so I thought the owner heard the noise and...

205
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:42,936
-It stopped once? -Yeah.

206
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,336
But after a while,

207
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:46,636
it started spinning making that loud noise again,

208
00:12:46,636 --> 00:12:48,336
that's why I remember.

209
00:12:53,736 --> 00:12:57,036
I see. That was the cause of the noise.

210
00:12:57,036 --> 00:13:00,036
But, why was only that?

211
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:05,336
This is...

212
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:10,736
I get it! So, that's the story!

213
00:13:12,598 --> 00:13:16,798
Gosh. The minute we take our eyes off of you, it's this.

214
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:18,198
Sonoko.

215
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,998
You're too young to be looking in on women's clothes yet!

216
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:24,998
I've got to tell Ran to educate you correctly!

217
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:33,398
Sonoko.

218
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:34,698
Sonoko?

219
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:37,298
How annoying. We know who the culprit is,

220
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:39,998
so why don't we get right to it and solve the case?

221
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:41,798
-What? -What?

222
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:44,998
The victim started washing clothes last night,

223
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:48,998
but didn't get around to taking out the laundry from the washing machine.

224
00:13:48,998 --> 00:13:50,698
So, we can assume that the incident happened

225
00:13:50,698 --> 00:13:52,598
during the time that the washing machine was running

226
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:56,998
which was between 22:20 to 23:00.

227
00:13:56,998 --> 00:13:59,798
But after scrutinizing this washing machine,

228
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:02,098
there's something queer about it.

229
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:03,898
Something queer?

230
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:07,298
Officer Sato, please turn the faucet on.

231
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:12,798
The faucet is shut off.

232
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:16,398
Exactly. The laundry hasn't been taken out

233
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:19,098
and yet the faucet is shut off.

234
00:14:19,098 --> 00:14:21,898
In other words, couldn't it be that someone stopped the water

235
00:14:21,898 --> 00:14:23,298
and drained the washing machine

236
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:26,398
in order to take something out of it?

237
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,398
What's that something?

238
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:32,198
Of course, the ticket for the Black Roses live.

239
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:35,398
But, why would it be in the washing machine?

240
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:37,098
Because the culprit was sure that

241
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:39,298
it would be in the pocket of the apron

242
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:42,198
that Masako took home from the shop.

243
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:43,598
The culprit last night,

244
00:14:43,598 --> 00:14:46,498
put the ticket that she stole from Haruka

245
00:14:46,498 --> 00:14:49,698
into her own apron pocket.

246
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:51,398
But, after closing time,

247
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:56,398
Masako mistakenly took that apron home thinking it was hers.

248
00:14:57,698 --> 00:15:01,698
That's why the culprit came to this room

249
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:05,098
to retrieve that ticket she had stolen.

250
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:06,298
Wait a minute!

251
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:09,298
It's just as if you're saying that I'm the culprit!

252
00:15:09,298 --> 00:15:12,598
But, aren't you? Ms. Kaori Kosuda?

253
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:18,298
You, who approached the apartment last night,

254
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:21,698
saw Masako throw the apron from the shop

255
00:15:21,698 --> 00:15:24,698
into the washing machine and run it.

256
00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:26,898
You were at a loss what to do.

257
00:15:26,898 --> 00:15:29,398
She eventually went shopping

258
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:31,798
while the washing machine was running.

259
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,998
You then stopped the water

260
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:36,998
and was about to take out your own apron,

261
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:40,198
but Masako who had forgotten something

262
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:43,198
came back right away.

263
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:45,398
After murdering Masako,

264
00:15:45,398 --> 00:15:47,498
in order to make it look as if a thief had broken in,

265
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:48,998
you messed the room up.

266
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:52,398
Then, in order to feign that the entire washing process had ended,

267
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:55,698
you set the washing machine to spin dry and left.

268
00:15:55,698 --> 00:15:57,298
Enough is enough!

269
00:15:57,298 --> 00:16:00,498
Who's going to believe something so ridiculous?

270
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:04,898
But you seem to have forgotten to open the faucet that you shut off.

271
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,498
Everything you're saying

272
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:09,298
is all a product of your imagination.

273
00:16:09,298 --> 00:16:11,498
Where on earth is the evidence?

274
00:16:11,498 --> 00:16:13,398
I've got proof.

275
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:15,798
It's the apron that you have with you!

276
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:17,198
Apron?

277
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:19,498
I get it. If it's just as Sonoko said

278
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:23,598
and Masako brought home Kaori's apron,

279
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:25,998
the apron that Kaori has right now

280
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:29,898
is indeed actually Masako's apron, right?

281
00:16:29,898 --> 00:16:31,798
I see.

282
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:36,998
You would recognize my apron, wouldn't you, Manager?

283
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,298
-Please confirm. -Yes.

284
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:45,398
Can you tell?

285
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:48,398
This is Ms. Kosuda's apron.

286
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:51,598
She just started working for us from last month,

287
00:16:51,598 --> 00:16:54,098
so her apron is still new.

288
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:55,898
So, now you know.

289
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:58,098
I'm not the culprit!

290
00:16:58,098 --> 00:17:00,698
Your deduction is wrong.

291
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:04,698
Mr. Uruma.

292
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:06,598
It seems that the washing machine last night

293
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:09,098
was especially noisy, wasn't it?

294
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:14,398
Yeah. Something hard must've been inside.

295
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:18,898
Officer Sato, please take a look inside the washing machine.

296
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:20,898
Okay.

297
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:22,998
So this is the apron in question.

298
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:28,498
What's up?

299
00:17:28,498 --> 00:17:30,398
There's a red marker inside.

300
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:31,498
What?

301
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:33,898
Right, a red marker.

302
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:35,798
It's a miscellaneous item of the shop

303
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:39,198
that's used to write in special orders.

304
00:17:39,198 --> 00:17:42,398
The shirt and towel that have been washed are pink

305
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:43,998
because although they were originally white,

306
00:17:43,998 --> 00:17:46,798
they were dyed by the ink of the red marker.

307
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,798
By the way, there's a dark smear on the pocket of the pants,

308
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:56,098
so it must've inadvertently been thrown into the washing machine.

309
00:17:57,198 --> 00:17:58,698
True.

310
00:17:58,698 --> 00:17:59,998
Inspector Megure.

311
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:03,998
Will you please take a look at Kaori's apron once again?

312
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:05,298
Okay.

313
00:18:05,298 --> 00:18:07,398
If my deduction is correct,

314
00:18:07,398 --> 00:18:11,498
I'm sure that apron is also dyed pink.

315
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:15,698
Too bad. The apron of Marine Coffee is black.

316
00:18:15,698 --> 00:18:17,598
It couldn't be dyed with a red marker.

317
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,398
-It's dyed. -Huh?

318
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,498
The washing instructions tab is dyed pink!

319
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:26,598
Kaori.

320
00:18:26,598 --> 00:18:28,198
After committing the murder,

321
00:18:28,198 --> 00:18:29,998
in order to leave no trace behind,

322
00:18:29,998 --> 00:18:32,898
you took your own apron out of the washing machine,

323
00:18:32,898 --> 00:18:35,698
and put Masako's apron inside it in place of yours.

324
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:39,098
Then you spun dried it with the other laundry.

325
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:41,498
That's why the washing instructions tab of the apron

326
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:44,798
that is inside the washing machine is white as it was originally.

327
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,798
And your apron's washing instructions tab is dyed pink.

328
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,998
No.

329
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:59,098
Ms. Kosuda. Why did you...

330
00:18:59,098 --> 00:19:03,898
That's because the ticket was originally what Kaori had bought.

331
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:06,798
Just what're you talking about?

332
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:08,698
It's what my boyfriend...

333
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:10,998
According to the shift chart that we saw a while ago at the shop,

334
00:19:10,998 --> 00:19:14,598
last Sunday when most of the employees were working,

335
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:18,098
only Kaori had taken a day off.

336
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:19,998
You took a day off

337
00:19:19,998 --> 00:19:23,898
to get in line overnight at the ticket shop, didn't you?

338
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:26,498
You did?

339
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:30,898
I just wanted to make my boyfriend happy.

340
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:35,298
To see him smiling on his birthday, the day of the live...

341
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:37,098
Your boyfriend?

342
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:38,798
Don't tell me...

343
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:40,698
He's a guitarist,

344
00:19:40,698 --> 00:19:43,898
although he's nameless.

345
00:19:43,898 --> 00:19:48,198
But he told me that he couldn't go because of work that day.

346
00:19:48,198 --> 00:19:51,798
So, that he was going to give the ticket

347
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:54,298
to an acquaintance at a record company.

348
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:58,698
A person at a record company? Me?

349
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,398
I realized it, just yesterday.

350
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:03,898
When you came to the shop.

351
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:06,498
What? You mean that nameless guitarist?

352
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:10,098
Yep. The day is his birthday, you see!

353
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:12,398
And he says he wants me to celebrate it with him.

354
00:20:12,398 --> 00:20:14,498
I didn't think that he would...

355
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:15,998
After thinking about it,

356
00:20:15,998 --> 00:20:19,198
I just couldn't not do anything about it.

357
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:20,898
On second thought,

358
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:23,598
Masako was watching all that.

359
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:28,298
Yes. It's all just as you've deduced.

360
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:34,498
After Masako left, I came here to retrieve the apron.

361
00:20:34,498 --> 00:20:37,598
But Masako saw me.

362
00:20:39,498 --> 00:20:41,498
You really surprised me, though.

363
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:42,598
To think that somebody as well-behaved as you

364
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:44,698
would steal something from a customer.

365
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:46,798
It's about time you wake up, don't you think?

366
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,598
You're just being used as a handy money-giving girlfriend!

367
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:51,698
No!

368
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:55,498
That guy doesn't give a hoot about you!

369
00:20:55,498 --> 00:20:59,398
Wrong! He told me that he loved me!

370
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:00,898
That he loved me.

371
00:21:00,898 --> 00:21:02,798
He loved me...

372
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:06,198
Masako.

373
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:13,798
When I snapped back to myself, I suddenly got scared.

374
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:14,998
That's why...

375
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:18,998
You tried to make it look to be the doing of a thief?

376
00:21:18,998 --> 00:21:21,598
But at the point, you tried to hide your crime

377
00:21:21,598 --> 00:21:23,798
and fabricated the site,

378
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:27,998
you turned into an even more ill-natured,

379
00:21:27,998 --> 00:21:30,798
cowardly liar than the guy who deceived you.

380
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,598
But the worst of them all

381
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:07,298
is the guitarist that deceived the two, right?

382
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:09,298
You can say that again.

383
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:11,998
I don't remember a thing, though.

384
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:15,198
If I were her, I would blast him with a punch.

385
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:23,798
Two-timing men are the pits!

386
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:34,898
Well, I guess he asked for it.

387
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:37,798
"Next Episode"

388
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:39,598
We the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

389
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,998
accompanied by Ran and Pops

390
00:23:41,998 --> 00:23:44,798
came to Kumamoto on a sightseeing tour.

391
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,198
I'm Justin.

392
00:23:46,198 --> 00:23:48,798
Justin Takamori.

393
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:51,098
The man just left Kumamon behind

394
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,898
and took the bag with him.

395
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,798
Report back to me as soon as the crowd of people subside!

396
00:23:58,198 --> 00:24:01,198
The culprit kidnapped the child and all!

397
00:24:01,198 --> 00:24:06,598
