1
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:25,588
Crap, it's 3:30.

2
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:28,029
I need to get home soon, or I'll miss out on my snack.

3
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:29,648
Your snack? Seriously?

4
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:31,529
Huh? What's going on?

5
00:00:32,019 --> 00:00:37,289
I believe the author Tawake Shintaro's mansion is around there.

6
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:40,098
Oh, the mystery writer.

7
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:42,358
Every book he publishes is a success.

8
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:44,139
It's no wonder he's got such a nice place.

9
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,529
Inspector?

10
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,708
You again?

11
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:52,849
If Division One is here, then...

12
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:53,999
That's right.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,599
The author Tawake Shintaro was found shot to death inside this residence.

14
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,099
What? Shot to death?

15
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:07,188
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

16
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:09,758
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

17
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,968
Shots are fired at a popular author!

18
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:14,038
The shady room is its own mystery!

19
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,618
Always determining the one truth

20
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:17,338
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

21
00:01:17,339 --> 00:01:20,079
his name is Detective Conan!

22
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,329
"The Novelist Known as the Demon King!"

23
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:11,148
The victim is Tawake Shintaro-san, 55 years old.

24
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,899
As you know, he was a mystery writer.

25
00:03:15,249 --> 00:03:18,619
The cause of death was blood loss from a gunshot wound to the abdomen.

26
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:23,519
We believe the weapon was this shotgun found on the floor near the body.

27
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:25,289
I see.

28
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:30,129
The victim was shot while sleeping on the sofa.

29
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,259
The windows of this study face north, so the lights were kept on even during the daytime.

30
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:41,358
A room doesn't get sunlight with north-facing windows.

31
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:46,389
According to forensics, the estimated time of death is around noon.

32
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:51,859
He was shot with that shotgun, right?

33
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:55,359
Most likely, since it was left on the floor there.

34
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:57,989
Let's review the case.

35
00:03:58,429 --> 00:04:03,318
While Tawake was sleeping on the sofa, the culprit entered the room,

36
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:08,079
killed him with a shotgun, dropped the murder weapon, and fled the scene.

37
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,119
Is that right?

38
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:15,068
Most likely. Since the glass door in the living room was partially open,

39
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:17,719
we believe the culprit entered and exited through there.

40
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:20,719
Take the body away for an autopsy.

41
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:27,349
We found no signs that the culprit searched the room, so we don't believe they were a thief.

42
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:29,509
Could the motive have been hatred?

43
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:35,729
What's this?

44
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,658
It's a bloodstain.

45
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:40,058
This must've splattered here when he was shot.

46
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:45,239
But since there's no blood on the curtains, that means they were open then, right?

47
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,369
Did the culprit take the time to close them?

48
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,839
If that's the case, then why did they do that?

49
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:58,478
They were probably trying to delay the discovery of the body.

50
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,839
It would give them more time to get away.

51
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:04,218
But who'd be looking in through this window?

52
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:05,009
Huh?

53
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,989
Isn't it visible from the next house over?

54
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,479
What's up with that house?

55
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,109
The weather's so nice, but all the shutters are closed.

56
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:21,378
Apparently the neighbors moved away last week. It's currently unoccupied.

57
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:22,739
It's empty, huh?

58
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:24,049
Inspector.

59
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:27,199
There's blood on this as well,

60
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:30,709
but there isn't a drop on the floor or wall around it.

61
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:35,838
Was that stand located elsewhere during the murder

62
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,589
and moved afterwards by the culprit?

63
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,089
Why would that be necessary?

64
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:45,719
Inspector Megure, I'm back from questioning the neighbors.

65
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:49,358
Nobody saw any suspicious persons.

66
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:51,159
Also, in the neighborhood...

67
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:55,219
There wasn't anyone who heard a gunshot.

68
00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:00,069
I'm not surprised no one heard anything with this racket.

69
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,238
The body was discovered by Tawake's apprentices, right?

70
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,159
We're having them wait in the living room.

71
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:10,019
Tawake Shintaro had apprentices, huh?

72
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:15,709
These four are Tawake-san's apprentices.

73
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:25,718
These two found the body.

74
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,498
I'm Akaike Naoya.

75
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:29,059
I'm Degawa Miyuki.

76
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:32,898
These two are apprentices as well.

77
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:35,189
They came as quickly as they could once we reached out to them.

78
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:37,528
I'm Bito Ryunosuke.

79
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:39,189
I'm Chigasaki Haruo.

80
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:43,949
We took turns on a daily rotation performing odd jobs for Tawake-sensei.

81
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:49,329
It was my turn today, so I'd been at the mansion since this morning.

82
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:52,668
You can leave for now, Akaike.

83
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:54,568
There's something I'd like you to do for me later.

84
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:56,329
Come back around three.

85
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:59,698
I've got something to tell you then, so bring Miyuki with you.

86
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,139
Yes, sir. See you later.

87
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:06,169
When the two of us returned...

88
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,708
We rushed to call the police.

89
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:18,809
Naturally, we haven't touched the crime scene.

90
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,319
Then it was the culprit who touched the curtains and stand.

91
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:27,319
By the way, Akaike-san, we should probably call them.

92
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:28,699
You're right.

93
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,269
If we don't call them soon, it'll cause trouble later.

94
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,449
Excuse me for a moment.

95
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,938
Who would it cause trouble for?

96
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:40,209
The dentist.

97
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:44,459
Akaike-san was told to make an appointment yesterday.

98
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,378
Damn molars.

99
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:49,199
Thank you.

100
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,139
I was able to make an appointment for tomorrow night at seven.

101
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:55,588
But now that he's dead...

102
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:59,628
I'd like to cancel the appointment I made yesterday.

103
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:00,359
Yes.

104
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,229
Tawake-san had bad teeth, huh?

105
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,239
The Demon King won't have to worry about cavities anymore.

106
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:10,619
Demon King?

107
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:14,369
Why did you call him the Demon King?

108
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:21,299
They'll find out as they continue their investigation.

109
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:28,179
Officer, to tell you the truth, Tawake-sensei was considered a brilliant hitmaker,

110
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:32,578
but there's no way he could've written more than ten books each year.

111
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:38,939
The books he published over the past few years were actually written by us.

112
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:40,439
What?

113
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:47,189
He'd make us write them and then make a few changes.

114
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,069
He barely wrote anything himself?

115
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,579
It was an open secret in the industry.

116
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,668
We were paid for our work,

117
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,958
but we didn't want to be ghostwriters.

118
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,079
But we couldn't defy him.

119
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:06,748
If you keep working for me, I'll help you debut when the time is right.

120
00:09:06,749 --> 00:09:11,079
But if you run away from me, I'll make sure you never debut!

121
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:17,218
In any case, his books are popular.

122
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:20,579
His influence in the publishing industry was absolute.

123
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,958
But he lied about helping us debut.

124
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,588
We jumped at the opportunity to apprentice with an author we admired,

125
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:28,899
but this place was like a labor camp.

126
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:30,889
So that's why you called him the Demon King.

127
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:34,779
All four of you had problems with Tawake-san.

128
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:39,659
The only way you could become independent was if he went away.

129
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:40,869
What?

130
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:44,249
In other words, you resented him.

131
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:46,879
You had motives for murder.

132
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:50,879
You're saying one of us killed him?

133
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,759
Inspector Megure, the forensics team is leaving.

134
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:56,788
We'll stay here a little longer.

135
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:58,778
He was shot using that?

136
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:00,309
That gun...

137
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:11,649
It's not inside the locker.

138
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:15,409
I knew it. That gun belonged to Tawake-sensei.

139
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:18,169
The weapon belonged to the victim?

140
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:26,169
He secretly stored his unlicensed gun here.

141
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,669
And you all knew about it.

142
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:31,618
I'm telling you, we're innocent.

143
00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:35,528
We know suspicion would fall on us if we used it.

144
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:37,929
There's no way we'd do something so foolish.

145
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:39,859
Yeah.

146
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:43,538
Perhaps that's exactly why you used it.

147
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:47,228
If you were the culprit, there's no way you'd use that gun.

148
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,729
You planned to use that excuse.

149
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:53,239
Once you start thinking that way, there's no end to it.

150
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,739
But won't suspicion be cleared once your alibis are verified?

151
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:59,369
That's true.

152
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:03,119
Then could you tell us where you were

153
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:06,169
and what you were doing around noon?

154
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:20,508
We were able to confirm Akaike-san's alibi.

155
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:23,289
We found several people to verify it.

156
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:28,588
However, we were unable to confirm Degawa-san, Bito-san,

157
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:30,359
and Chigasaki-san's alibis.

158
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:34,108
Of course you couldn't. We were writing.

159
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:35,099
Yeah.

160
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:35,859
Yeah.

161
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,989
For now, we've narrowed down four suspects to three.

162
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:41,029
Wait a minute! You mean...

163
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,068
Naturally, we're not assuming one of you is the culprit.

164
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:49,039
But without clear alibis...

165
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:53,998
Chigasaki, it's because of your stupid actions that the police suspect me.

166
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:57,549
What? But it's Miyuki who seems like she could've done it.

167
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:01,559
Bito-san is a hundred times more suspicious than I am.

168
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,779
Cut it out, guys. Don't point fingers at each other.

169
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:09,198
I know forced infighting when I see it.

170
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:12,359
Did the three of you scheme to kill Tawake together?

171
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:13,779
What?

172
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:17,159
Why is this happening?

173
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:20,178
Don't cry.

174
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:23,878
You're able to say that because you have an alibi.

175
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,448
You're responsible for this, Akaike-san.

176
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:32,138
You did nothing about the Demon King's tyranny even though you're the oldest.

177
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:33,039
That's right.

178
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,089
Yeah.

179
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:38,198
Got it.

180
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:42,528
The autopsy found sleeping pills in the body's system.

181
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,849
Sleeping pills?

182
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,599
The Demon King never took sleeping pills.

183
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,018
The culprit probably secretly fed them to him,

184
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,448
but why was it necessary to put him to sleep?

185
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:58,228
More importantly, if it was possible to feed him sleeping pills,

186
00:12:58,229 --> 00:13:00,989
then they should've been able to poison him, too.

187
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:02,368
You're right.

188
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:04,279
Poisoning him would've been easy.

189
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,828
But they shot him instead.

190
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,709
There must be some reason the culprit did that.

191
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,068
I see.

192
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:13,378
I suppose all four of them are mystery writers.

193
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:16,209
They're practically mystery-solving experts.

194
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,038
I know.

195
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:25,078
By using that gun, the culprit was trying to make it look like one of us was the culprit.

196
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,518
That must be it.

197
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,659
We've been set up!

198
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:32,699
But something's not right.

199
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:34,669
Hold on.

200
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:37,869
This curtain was opened and closed.

201
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:39,669
Could it be?

202
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,019
If that's the case, then...

203
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,469
It must've left some trace behind.

204
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:53,629
Tawake

205
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:18,838
A piece of aluminum foil.

206
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,609
They made it using this.

207
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:29,098
But how do I prove it?

208
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:31,279
Judging by the culprit's personality...

209
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:34,618
Is it possible that that was...

210
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:37,689
Shiga Dentist

211
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,688
I knew it.

212
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:43,728
That just leaves the weather.

213
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:46,248
It's supposed to be clear all day tomorrow, too.

214
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:47,639
That'll work.

215
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,858
The culprit must be one of the apprentices.

216
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:57,539
Which one of the three without an alibi is it?

217
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,859
Yeah, he said he figured out who the culprit is.

218
00:15:03,229 --> 00:15:04,468
Who is it?

219
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:07,739
Apparently the culprit will show up at the crime scene tomorrow,

220
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,869
around noon, the same time the murder happened.

221
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:14,249
What? The inspector said to leave for the day?

222
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:15,019
Yeah.

223
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,138
He asked us to come back tomorrow.

224
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:18,239
Huh?

225
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,009
The Next Day

226
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:32,158
Mori-kun, what did you mean when you said the culprit would show up?

227
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:32,769
What?

228
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:37,758
Does that mean everyone currently present is innocent?

229
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,149
Great!

230
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:42,069
Inspector, I came like you told me to—

231
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:47,538
I came like you told me to come, Inspector.

232
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:49,988
Thank you very much.

233
00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:52,428
It's the Sleeping Kogoro!

234
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:57,678
Everyone, we were distracted by the whodunnit

235
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:03,718
of who killed Tawake and overlooked something important:

236
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,088
The howdunnit.

237
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,719
How did the culprit kill Tawake?

238
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,148
What?

239
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:13,088
They put him to sleep using sleeping pills,

240
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:16,479
entered the room, and shot him to death.

241
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:19,928
First, Detective Takagi, remember what I told you this morning.

242
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:22,479
Yes, sir. Chiba.

243
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:23,719
Here.

244
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,398
That looks about right.

245
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,859
Thank you, Detective Chiba.

246
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:35,238
Next, the gun has been tied to the stand that was by the entrance of this room.

247
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:38,119
It's currently beside the chair I'm sitting in.

248
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:43,379
The gun has been loaded with a paint bullet instead of a live round.

249
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:46,898
We've set up everything according to your instructions.

250
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:48,608
Could this be?

251
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:51,008
It certainly seems that way.

252
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,548
It's not possible in this study.

253
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:55,719
After all, the windows face north.

254
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,049
Mister, I'm opening the curtains.

255
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,059
There.

256
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:01,689
What is that?

257
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:08,779
A mirror?

258
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:11,528
It's a concave mirror.

259
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:15,929
A handmade one made by wrapping a wooden frame with aluminum foil.

260
00:17:16,389 --> 00:17:20,209
I asked Professor Agasa to make it for me.

261
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:25,589
The culprit who shot Tawake should appear soon.

262
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:33,088
Could it be?

263
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:34,219
It really is.

264
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:35,599
Could it be?

265
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:47,649
The focused sunlight ignited the shell.

266
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:51,909
Yes. This phenomenon occasionally causes fires.

267
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:55,918
This trick has been used repeatedly in mysteries.

268
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,468
But this trick is normally made possibly by south-facing rooms...

269
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:03,818
Was pulled off in this north-facing study using a mirror.

270
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:04,669
Indeed.

271
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,049
The culprit used this method to kill Tawake.

272
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:12,878
Since the culprit didn't want anyone to notice the gunshot and look into the room,

273
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:16,549
they waited for this time of day when the sound would be drowned out.

274
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,738
They used the construction noises.

275
00:18:19,739 --> 00:18:22,238
That explains the sleeping pills, too.

276
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:27,319
They couldn't hit the victim if he moved, so they had to put him to sleep.

277
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,319
In order to conceal this method,

278
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:34,929
after committing the murder, the culprit moved the stand used to fix the gun in place.

279
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:39,358
In order to allow the focused sunlight into the room,

280
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,998
they had to leave the curtains open.

281
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:45,418
To keep their trick from being discovered,

282
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,199
the culprit closed them after committing the murder.

283
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:51,589
Any of the apprentices could have used this method.

284
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,539
Since it's such a famous trick, they all knew about it.

285
00:18:57,089 --> 00:19:00,348
However, the reason they used this method was because

286
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:04,498
by fabricating an alibi for Tawake's death,

287
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:06,599
they wouldn't be considered a suspect.

288
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:11,479
In other words, the person with an alibi is the culprit.

289
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:13,608
Which means...

290
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:14,908
Could it be?

291
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:16,359
It was Akaike-san?

292
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,369
But Mori-san...

293
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:22,078
It was your turn yesterday to perform odd jobs.

294
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,809
You secretly fed Tawake sleeping pills.

295
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:27,309
I feel so tired for some reason.

296
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:30,399
You can leave for the day, Akaike.

297
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:33,198
You took the gun out of the locker,

298
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:36,479
attached it to the stand, opened the curtains,

299
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,858
opened the shutters of the house next door,

300
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:43,249
set up the concave mirror, fabricated an alibi around noon,

301
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,889
and killed Tawake.

302
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:51,468
Then you returned to the crime scene to clean up your trick

303
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:53,948
and left the glass door in the living room slightly open

304
00:19:53,949 --> 00:19:56,149
so it would seem like the culprit entered through it.

305
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:04,299
You destroyed the concave mirror made of aluminum foil in the house next door

306
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:05,929
and closed the shutters.

307
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,938
You had Degawa Miyuki-san accompany you

308
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:11,488
and discovered the body first

309
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:16,419
so she could testify that you didn't touch the crime scene.

310
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,368
This is all speculation, Mori-san.

311
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:26,089
I borrowed the key from the real estate office so I could examine the house next door.

312
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:28,399
Apparently you did, too.

313
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:31,208
You claimed that Tawake was thinking about buying it

314
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:36,288
and wanted to take a look around inside and made a spare key.

315
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:38,279
That's speculation as well.

316
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:42,529
But you gave yourself away, Akaike-san.

317
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,539
I'm talking about the dentist appointment.

318
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:50,469
I confirmed with them that no appointment was ever made for Tawake.

319
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:53,419
When you made the appointment the other day...

320
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:56,728
I was able to make an appointment for tomorrow night at seven.

321
00:20:56,729 --> 00:21:00,679
...you were just pretending, like you did when you called to cancel yesterday.

322
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:04,679
I'd like to cancel the appointment I made yesterday. Yes.

323
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:06,349
You pretended to call.

324
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:11,189
It's because you knew there was no point in making an appointment.

325
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:12,528
That's right.

326
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:16,439
You knew beforehand that Tawake would die.

327
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,029
You knew something only the culprit would know.

328
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:28,858
Tawake-sensei had missed plenty of appointments until now.

329
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:31,658
If I made an appointment I knew would be canceled,

330
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:34,919
I would've caused trouble for them again.

331
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:38,898
That's why I decided to take down

332
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:43,328
the Demon King who caused nothing but problems for others myself.

333
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:48,648
I wanted to free the four of us.

334
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:50,548
I had to do it.

335
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:52,509
After all, I'm the oldest.

336
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:24,308
I'm disgusted by Tawake Shintaro, too.

337
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:26,668
I can't believe he was making his apprentices write his books.

338
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:32,048
He's like a detective who takes credit for someone else's mystery-solving.

339
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:33,919
There's no detective like that!

340
00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:37,628
Wait, what's happening? I feel a stinging pain in my chest.

341
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:39,169
Is he actually experiencing some guilt?

342
00:23:39,699 --> 00:23:41,848
It was a toothpick!

343
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:43,869
He doesn't feel guilty at all.

344
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:48,389
What?

345
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:51,478
We spotted Detective Chiba, so we decided to follow him.

346
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:52,768
You're on a stakeout, right?

347
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:54,139
We'll help.

348
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:58,649
How did you know the culprit lives in the apartment across the street?

349
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:00,649
Takagi-san.

350
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,778
They're all getting ready to go out.

351
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,739
Perhaps they're making a deal.

352
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:08,559
Huh? What are they doing?

353
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,779
The next episode of Conan is "Stakeout!"
