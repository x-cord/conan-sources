1
00:00:03,016 --> 00:00:08,615
"Funako Nakai (22)" -A person went missing yesterday!

2
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:12,216
It would make me extremely happy if you could find him.

3
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:17,515
I heard that yesterday and I refused.

4
00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:19,915
I'm busy, you see.

5
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,615
No offense.

6
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:25,215
But you look like you have a lot of time on your hands.

7
00:00:25,216 --> 00:00:26,516
What?

8
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:31,515
I don't believe I'm getting through to you.

9
00:00:31,516 --> 00:00:33,515
"Crime Plan" -So once again...

10
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:35,615
A "Crime Plan"?

11
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:38,615
I'm telling you that's a bunch of baloney.

12
00:00:38,616 --> 00:00:41,015
Besides, you're not even acquainted

13
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:43,615
with that guy's who's missing, right?

14
00:00:43,616 --> 00:00:45,115
Oh, well...

15
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:47,615
I just happened to run into him on the street and...

16
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:51,715
"The Mirage" -He was the split image of "Mr. Mirage"

17
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:56,115
a character that appears in the popular game for girls.

18
00:00:56,116 --> 00:00:58,715
So you followed him and snuck camera shots of him.

19
00:00:58,716 --> 00:01:00,716
Sort of.

20
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:06,115
Like I said, detectives don't go helping stalkers.

21
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:08,015
No one cares about your merge or whatever.

22
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:09,215
Go on home!

23
00:01:09,216 --> 00:01:11,616
It's Mr. Mirage.

24
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,315
Why don't you go to the police?

25
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:20,615
Your suggestion is more than sensible but I can't.

26
00:01:20,616 --> 00:01:22,316
I don't have much time left.

27
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,315
This could be my big break.

28
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:29,216
For this could be the birth of Detective Funachi!

29
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,015
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

30
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:35,015
Love and cases come from the same origin.

31
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:37,215
An odd client who calls herself "Funachi".

32
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:39,515
A mere missing person search leads to an unexpected case.

33
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,015
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:42,915
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,016
His name is Detective Conan.

36
00:03:25,977 --> 00:03:31,177
"The Starry-Eyed Girl's Confused Deduction."

37
00:03:40,877 --> 00:03:43,877
"Hikone."

38
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:51,076
Mr. Hikone. Are you there?

39
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:52,676
Mr. Hikone?

40
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:55,577
I, Funachi, can't go any farther than this.

41
00:03:56,777 --> 00:04:00,076
Mr. Hikone? Is that the name of the man who disappeared?

42
00:04:00,077 --> 00:04:03,776
You're the boy I just saw a while ago.

43
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,976
I'm Conan Edogawa.

44
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:07,776
I'm sorry. I haven't introduced myself.

45
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:10,476
I'm Funako Nakai.

46
00:04:10,477 --> 00:04:13,276
If it's okay with you, please call me Funachi.

47
00:04:13,277 --> 00:04:15,276
Miss Funachi.

48
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:16,776
No need for honorifics.

49
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:19,376
By the way, Funachi is the name of a heroine

50
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:22,476
that appears in a popular girly game who adores Mr. Mirage.

51
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:23,976
And I'm borrowing her name, you see.

52
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:26,676
There may be copyright issues and such,

53
00:04:26,677 --> 00:04:28,776
but I hope people understand that

54
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:30,376
it's only out of respect and inspiration that I do so.

55
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:34,476
Additionally, based on the game's world view and setting...

56
00:04:34,477 --> 00:04:36,876
I can't keep up.

57
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,876
And?

58
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:41,276
Since when has he been missing, Mr. Hikone?

59
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:43,976
The day before yesterday when I visited him in the afternoon,

60
00:04:43,977 --> 00:04:48,076
the door was unlocked and no one was in.

61
00:04:48,077 --> 00:04:50,576
I think nobody's been here since.

62
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:52,876
Two full days.

63
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:54,376
What's this?

64
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,176
The lock's been tampered with. Moreover, just recently.

65
00:04:57,177 --> 00:05:00,376
I, Funachi, had noticed that too.

66
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:02,277
I wonder if it's a burglar after all?

67
00:05:04,577 --> 00:05:06,476
"What are you?"

68
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:09,676
Where did tied up Mr. Mirage...

69
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:13,076
I mean Mr. Hikone disappear to?

70
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:14,176
Tied up?

71
00:05:14,177 --> 00:05:17,276
Oh, maybe?

72
00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:18,876
Please excuse me!

73
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:20,176
He's not here.

74
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:21,476
Not here.

75
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:22,776
Not here either.

76
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:23,976
He's not here!

77
00:05:23,977 --> 00:05:26,177
Which means...

78
00:05:28,677 --> 00:05:31,476
Hey, just what're you...

79
00:05:31,477 --> 00:05:33,476
Mr. Edogawa, please help me!

80
00:05:33,477 --> 00:05:36,376
Maybe Mr. Hikone is buried under here!

81
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,876
Mr. Edogawa?

82
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:40,176
You know what?

83
00:05:40,177 --> 00:05:46,376
This is the second floor so I don't think it's likely at all.

84
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:48,076
Right.

85
00:05:48,077 --> 00:05:50,876
Funachi, you goofed again.

86
00:05:50,877 --> 00:05:52,676
A fantasist.

87
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:55,376
Mr. Mirage.

88
00:05:55,377 --> 00:05:56,777
Stay here.

89
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:02,176
Hello.

90
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:04,877
"Takashi Kiyose (20), University Student."

91
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:08,276
-What? -Do you know where

92
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:10,576
your next door neighbor, Mr. Hikone, went?

93
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:12,476
No, I don't.

94
00:06:12,477 --> 00:06:14,976
But was that the name of my neighbor?

95
00:06:14,977 --> 00:06:18,676
Did you notice something different about him or around him?

96
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:21,077
No, not really.

97
00:06:23,377 --> 00:06:24,676
"Akio Nashida (40)" -Cut out the noise.

98
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:26,776
What's all the racket about?

99
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:28,876
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:28,877 --> 00:06:31,876
I'm looking for your neighbor, Mr. Hikone.

101
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:33,676
Hikone?

102
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:36,876
Don't know him!

103
00:06:36,877 --> 00:06:38,777
Wait...

104
00:06:42,377 --> 00:06:43,876
"Kiyose."

105
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:45,577
"Nashida."

106
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:54,677
Just what's going on?

107
00:06:56,277 --> 00:06:58,376
I was scared out of my wits for a moment.

108
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,876
Please close the door, Mr. Edogawa.

109
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:02,277
Okay.

110
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:11,176
What was that?

111
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:13,976
It felt like someone watching.

112
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:15,676
Is anything wrong?

113
00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:17,476
Oh, nope.

114
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:20,176
Funachi, you said you can't go to the police

115
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:21,676
and you don't have time.

116
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:24,076
Does that have something to do with that notebook?

117
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:29,076
Could it be that Mr. Edogawa, you're a detective too?

118
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:32,976
Yes. I always help Pops out.

119
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:33,977
In other words,

120
00:07:33,978 --> 00:07:37,276
my concerns over confidentiality have already been eliminated?

121
00:07:37,277 --> 00:07:40,976
-Yeah. -Please take a look at it, then.

122
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:43,676
This is Mr. Hikone's?

123
00:07:43,677 --> 00:07:46,576
Yes, I think it's handwritten.

124
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:49,676
"No, Funachi, not that!"

125
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,776
I scolded myself in this way.

126
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:53,876
But I was so worried about Mr. Hikone

127
00:07:53,877 --> 00:07:57,877
that I finally came in here yesterday and took it.

128
00:08:01,877 --> 00:08:03,077
This is?

129
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:13,276
So, once a month the jewelries are exchanged for more expensive ones.

130
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:15,976
The date is October 24th.

131
00:08:15,977 --> 00:08:17,276
It's today!

132
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:21,876
Today is indeed the day that the crime will be committed!

133
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:26,076
The way the jewelries will be delivered is also written in detail.

134
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:29,476
Don't tell me this is a real "Crime Plan"?

135
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:31,176
But no matter how hard I looked,

136
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:35,576
I couldn't find a jewelry store that matched the one in the notebook.

137
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:36,877
Wait a second.

138
00:08:40,177 --> 00:08:42,576
I wonder what Mr. Hikone is doing at this time...

139
00:08:42,577 --> 00:08:44,676
Wearing a mask and armed with a pistol.

140
00:08:44,677 --> 00:08:46,176
"Quiet, or I'll kill you!"

141
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:47,576
"The jewelry, hurry up!"

142
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:51,676
"Put the jewelry in this bag!" -Maybe he threaten the salesclerk this way.

143
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:55,476
What should I, Funachi, do?

144
00:08:55,477 --> 00:08:58,676
After taking a good look, isn't there something funny about this?

145
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:01,776
I'm stunned and lost at this point!

146
00:09:01,777 --> 00:09:03,476
Over here and over here too.

147
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,576
They're all reversed.

148
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:07,776
Reversed?

149
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:10,576
The door keys and the keys of the cases as well.

150
00:09:10,577 --> 00:09:14,076
They're useless this way.

151
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:15,176
I see!

152
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:19,476
Maybe the name of the store too?

153
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:20,876
Isigami.

154
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:22,776
I found it!

155
00:09:22,777 --> 00:09:25,576
Moreover, it's right near here.

156
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:28,076
Only a two to three minute walk from here!

157
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:31,076
-Really? -You're fantastic, Mr. Edogawa!

158
00:09:31,077 --> 00:09:34,876
Magnificent deduction and gathering of clues.

159
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:37,676
But, what shall we do?

160
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,076
Shall we make a call?

161
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:41,776
Or shall we go there?

162
00:09:41,777 --> 00:09:43,776
If I do that, I may run into Mr. Hikone

163
00:09:43,777 --> 00:09:45,777
when he's committing the robbery.

164
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:53,077
-Please don't, Mr. Hikone! -What is it? Something's not right.

165
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,277
That's...

166
00:09:58,377 --> 00:10:01,176

167
00:10:01,177 --> 00:10:03,277
Maybe.

168
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:09,677
Here it is!

169
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:15,077
But the most important thing isn't here.

170
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:19,376
No, rather, it was here.

171
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:21,076
Maybe?

172
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:22,077
"Tenbun Publishing."

173
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:26,376
"Tenbun Publishing."

174
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:27,876
Yes, hello?

175
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,876
This is Tenbun Publishing's Tenbun Monthly editorial department calling.

176
00:10:31,877 --> 00:10:33,976
I'd like to speak to Mr. Kazumasa Hikone, please.

177
00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:37,676
Well, he's not in at the moment.

178
00:10:37,677 --> 00:10:39,676
Oh, you must be his family.

179
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:43,676
Well, the novel "Crime Plan" he brought in the other day,

180
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,776
was evaluated at our editorial meeting

181
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:48,176
and we decided to publish it.

182
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:52,076
Will you please ask him to call us back?

183
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:54,976
The advent of a shocking truth!

184
00:10:54,977 --> 00:10:57,576
I will. Goodbye.

185
00:10:57,577 --> 00:11:00,976
Which means these are the papers he rewrote

186
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:04,776
and the things in the notebook are his interviews and research?

187
00:11:04,777 --> 00:11:06,876
Yes, I think so.

188
00:11:06,877 --> 00:11:12,076
In other words, everything is a coincidence, like always.

189
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:14,377
Like always, I, Funachi's...

190
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,076
Disappointment again.

191
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:22,276
Rather, what is it about Mr. Hikone's illusion as a novelist

192
00:11:22,277 --> 00:11:23,976
that can make me mistake his world for reality?

193
00:11:23,977 --> 00:11:26,476
It's what can be called God's territory.

194
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,676
I... I doubt that.

195
00:11:29,677 --> 00:11:32,476
Rather, there are too many questions unanswered.

196
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:34,576
Most importantly, it's that the whereabouts of Mr. Hikone

197
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,577
have been unknown for a full two days already.

198
00:11:41,177 --> 00:11:44,376
"Isigami Jewelry."

199
00:11:44,377 --> 00:11:47,276
Quiet or I'll kill you!

200
00:11:47,277 --> 00:11:49,477
Hurry, give me the jewelry!

201
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:00,707
Don't tell me?

202
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:03,706
Mr. Edogawa?

203
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:05,506
What do you mean by "don't tell me"?

204
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:09,507
Oh, no, it can't be?

205
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:20,707
Officer Takagi!

206
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,706
Conan?

207
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:25,306
A robbery?

208
00:12:25,307 --> 00:12:27,706
Well, sort of...

209
00:12:27,707 --> 00:12:31,406
Today's the jewelry renewal day, isn't it?

210
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:33,306
The robber who entered the basement broiler room

211
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:36,906
from the manhole of the sewer.

212
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:42,506
Stole all the jewelry that was just brought in, no?

213
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:44,507
How did you know?

214
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:48,206
Just as I thought.

215
00:12:48,207 --> 00:12:51,706
What I feared has come true.

216
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:55,006
Could this lie be real or could this reality be an illusion?

217
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,707
I, Funachi, can't figure it out.

218
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:03,107
Who is she?

219
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:12,306
We've just stationed officers in the sewers and all connected exits.

220
00:13:12,307 --> 00:13:15,006
That's exactly what the perpetrator would want you to do.

221
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:16,107
What?

222
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:20,406
He's going to make it look as if he's going out the same way he got in

223
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:22,406
but no, he's going to flee above ground.

224
00:13:22,407 --> 00:13:24,306
That's the plan.

225
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:25,906
Plan?

226
00:13:25,907 --> 00:13:27,606
Right.

227
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:28,707
See.

228
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,906
This is...

229
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:38,506
It's a toy gun.

230
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:41,106
It's just as planned too.

231
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:42,606
Come to think of it.

232
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:45,106
Funachi, show me the notebook once more.

233
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:46,507
Oh, here.

234
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:52,006
Here.

235
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:54,306
"I kill the crime planner somewhere nearby

236
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:57,306
and make everyone believe I fled far."

237
00:13:57,307 --> 00:13:59,506
"Then go back to everyday life."

238
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:02,106
"This indeed is the perfect crime."

239
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,606
I see!

240
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:06,806
Could it be that the perpetrator is someone else?

241
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:12,406
-What? -Oh my! My Mr. Mirage is doomed!

242
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:15,006
I, Funachi, will not be defeated!

243
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:17,906
Mr. Edogawa, let's capture the real perpetrator!

244
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:19,806
Hey, wait, where are you going?

245
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:21,906
I wonder where to?

246
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:23,306
This way, Funachi!

247
00:14:23,307 --> 00:14:25,006
Conan?

248
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:27,706
Officer Takagi, come with us too.

249
00:14:27,707 --> 00:14:29,507
Okay!

250
00:14:36,907 --> 00:14:39,406
What're you guys?

251
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:41,206
Mr. Nashida?

252
00:14:41,207 --> 00:14:43,606
Could you give us a minute?

253
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:44,706
Police?

254
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:47,306
What the heck did I do?

255
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:48,906
Hey, Funachi.

256
00:14:48,907 --> 00:14:51,707
How come the paper flew up back then?

257
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:55,106
It's a mystery.

258
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:57,906
A wind suddenly came blowing.

259
00:14:57,907 --> 00:15:01,406
But, the window of Mr. Hikone's room was closed, wasn't it?

260
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:05,407
That's why when we first opened the door, the paper didn't fly?

261
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:12,507
Maybe?

262
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:21,206
I found it!

263
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:24,507
The wind indeed blew in from there!

264
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:32,606
Mr. Nashida, you were watching Mr. Hikone writing his novel

265
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,206
from that space over there, weren't you?

266
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:39,706
Then you set your eyes on the computer that was here,

267
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:43,206
broke the lock, entered, and stole it.

268
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:45,606
What? Is it true?

269
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:47,206
You gotta be joking!

270
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,106
Why don't you search my room and all then!

271
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:51,006
If it's not in your room,

272
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:54,106
you probably pawned it off at a pawn.

273
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:57,406
If I'm not mistaken there's a pawn shop nearby, isn't there?

274
00:15:57,407 --> 00:15:59,506
I'll bet you have the pawn ticket and the cash

275
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:02,006
in your pocket right this moment?

276
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:04,507
Isn't that why you're in such a good mood?

277
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,606
Then, you read this "Crime Plan", carried it out,

278
00:16:10,607 --> 00:16:12,606
robbed the jewelry store

279
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:14,606
and even killed Hikone.

280
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,506
Wait! What?

281
00:16:16,507 --> 00:16:18,006
Cut out the joke!

282
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:20,406
Then, please tell us the whole truth.

283
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:23,806
Like I said. I did steal the computer

284
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,606
and pawned it off.

285
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:29,206
But when I went in, the door lock was already broken.

286
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:30,306
I hope you're telling the truth?

287
00:16:30,307 --> 00:16:31,606
I'm not lying!

288
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:35,506
I didn't rob any jewelry store. It's the truth!

289
00:16:35,507 --> 00:16:38,706
Funachi, the papers that flew in the air

290
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,907
when Mr. Nashida closed the door, was that the first time?

291
00:16:57,907 --> 00:17:00,206
There's one here too!

292
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:01,306
Right.

293
00:17:01,307 --> 00:17:05,606
The eyes I felt were watching back then were coming from both sides.

294
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,507
And the real perpetrator is...

295
00:17:22,707 --> 00:17:25,006
What on earth do you want?

296
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:27,506
Don't play dumb. I know you read it.

297
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:28,906
What?

298
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:33,006
Mr. Kiyose, may I talk to you for a while?

299
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:34,206
So, what?

300
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,406
So, if you peek in from there,

301
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:38,206
I'll bet you could see Mr. Hikone's back,

302
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:40,306
or rather, the computer screen?

303
00:17:40,307 --> 00:17:43,806
Then you decided to rob the jewelry store and broke into his house.

304
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:46,106
You carefully and meticulously read the "Crime Plan"

305
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,706
and committed the crime, didn't you?

306
00:17:47,707 --> 00:17:49,106
You gotta be joking!

307
00:17:49,107 --> 00:17:50,507
Where's the proof?

308
00:17:51,607 --> 00:17:52,906
You got so much mud on.

309
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:55,807
You should've kept your waders on right through.

310
00:17:58,107 --> 00:17:59,706
I got it!

311
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:01,706
If you also used the sewer when returning home,

312
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:04,706
you wouldn't have gotten mud on yourself.

313
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:07,306
You got it on because you returned above ground, right?

314
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:08,606
Above ground?

315
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:10,306
There are two parallel roads that you can take

316
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:12,706
to come from the jewelry store to here.

317
00:18:12,707 --> 00:18:15,906
We took one of those roads to make a round trip,

318
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:18,306
but we didn't run into you, Mr. Kiyose.

319
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:21,706
The other road that you took because it rained last night,

320
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:24,706
I believe had a lot of puddles.

321
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:26,507
What's this?

322
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,107
That's...

323
00:18:34,407 --> 00:18:35,906
It's a match!

324
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,806
When you broke the door lock,

325
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:40,706
it must've chipped off and flew into the closet.

326
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:42,706
All that needs to be accounted for now are the jewelry.

327
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:45,406
I'll get a search warrant right away and...

328
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:48,906
As to that, it's probably...

329
00:18:48,907 --> 00:18:52,006
Mr. Kiyose, that key for the coin locker

330
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,806
wasn't there a while ago, was it?

331
00:18:54,807 --> 00:18:58,006
I see! There was a station on the way here.

332
00:18:58,007 --> 00:19:00,507
You mean he put it in that coin locker?

333
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,406
I was fired from my part-time job.

334
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:07,606
Money. I wanted money!

335
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:11,106
But, that doesn't mean you can go and kill people, does it?

336
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:12,306
Don't be ridiculous!

337
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:14,706
I didn't kill anybody!

338
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:18,307
Then where could Mr. Hikone be?

339
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:24,406
Who are all you people?

340
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:26,306
No joke?

341
00:19:26,307 --> 00:19:28,307
So, he was fine after all.

342
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,306
Are you Mr. Hikone?

343
00:19:31,307 --> 00:19:32,606
Police?

344
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:34,206
How did you know he'd be all fine?

345
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:37,406
Because his room was clean.

346
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:40,406
I just didn't think it was possible that he was attacked here.

347
00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:43,106
If he were to be attacked outside,

348
00:19:43,107 --> 00:19:44,806
his keys would've been stolen,

349
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:47,506
and the room didn't have to be broken into, right?

350
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:49,006
In other words,

351
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:50,806
you're something Mr. Edogawa!

352
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:54,507
You're in God's realm! Rather, you're God!

353
00:21:20,707 --> 00:21:22,506
I see.

354
00:21:22,507 --> 00:21:25,706
I'm sorry to have caused you trouble.

355
00:21:25,707 --> 00:21:28,506
But, where were you for a full two days?

356
00:21:28,507 --> 00:21:30,806
I was fed up with my lack of talent,

357
00:21:30,807 --> 00:21:33,006
so I was wandering here and there.

358
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:37,506
I ran out of money so I had no choice but to come on home again.

359
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:39,306
I feel wretched.

360
00:21:39,307 --> 00:21:41,706
Writing's not my cup of tea. It's just a dream.

361
00:21:41,707 --> 00:21:44,806
I've had enough of illusions.

362
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:46,606
I'm going back to my hometown.

363
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:50,606
However, that illusion, rather that dream that you had

364
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:53,106
has become a reality.

365
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:55,706
You got a call from the publisher.

366
00:21:55,707 --> 00:22:00,006
They say that your "Crime Plan" is going to be published.

367
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:02,606
Yeah, right.

368
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:03,906
No. Really?

369
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:04,907
Yeah.

370
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:09,507
I did it!

371
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:15,907
You're Ms. Funachi?

372
00:22:18,307 --> 00:22:19,806
Do you know each other?

373
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:24,007
A while ago, I went to interview a game software store.

374
00:22:25,307 --> 00:22:27,006
Back then, she explained everything in more detail

375
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:29,507
than the salesclerk there, you see.

376
00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:34,906
You lied saying that you met him coincidentally on the street.

377
00:22:34,907 --> 00:22:36,106
I, Funachi, no...

378
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:40,106
I just thought he wouldn't remember me.

379
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:43,906
Therefore, based on my calm and objective discretion...

380
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:48,106
Could it be that you saved me?

381
00:22:48,107 --> 00:22:50,406
Are you from the police?

382
00:22:50,407 --> 00:22:51,606
What?

383
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:53,606
Or a detective?

384
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:56,006
I...

385
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,406
Thank you!

386
00:22:57,407 --> 00:23:00,406
How about going out to eat together as a token of my appreciation?

387
00:23:00,407 --> 00:23:03,806
May I write about you in my next novel?

388
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:06,007
Tell me more about yourself, Funachi!

389
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:11,606
Could this be what is called a happy ending, Funachi?

390
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:14,206
This was totally unexpected, you see!

391
00:23:14,207 --> 00:23:17,306
I'm sorry to have to turn you down but,

392
00:23:17,307 --> 00:23:18,906
To think that 2D will become 3D

393
00:23:18,907 --> 00:23:22,106
and Mr. Mirage will turn out to be the real thing.

394
00:23:22,107 --> 00:23:26,406
It's totally unbelievable for me!

395
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:28,006
Oh, wait, Funachi!

396
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:31,106
Funachi...

397
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:34,006
Wait!

398
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:36,006
How'd the case turn out?

399
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:41,707
The case gave birth to a detective of a girly game.

400
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:48,606
"Next Episode."

401
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:50,806
Messed up in a suicide?

402
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:53,206
You were called out here by someone you don't know?

403
00:23:53,207 --> 00:23:56,106
To come in front of this building at 8:00.

404
00:23:56,107 --> 00:23:58,406
Officer Takagi said that the point at which it was supposed to be dropped

405
00:23:58,407 --> 00:24:02,406
and the actual place it was dropped were not the same.

406
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,506
Don't tell me you're thinking of something absurd?

407
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:08,006
Something absurd?

408
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:13,407
