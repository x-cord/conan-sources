1
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:21,894
Tonight's stage is in Kagoshima.

2
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:23,894
Pops goes wild over a rare distilled spirit.

3
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:26,094
Rice malt is the aroma of human relationship.

4
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:27,494
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:29,094
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:31,295
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:52,657 --> 00:01:54,156
"Kagoshima Nichiuri TV" -Well, when one wants liquor the first thing

8
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:55,556
that comes to mind is beer.

9
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:58,757
Super cold beer drank in one gulp,

10
00:02:02,157 --> 00:02:05,256
there's nothing better than it.

11
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:07,956
What's so good about it, is of course the bitterness.

12
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:12,156
No, rather, what I want to ask you about is not beer.

13
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:15,956
I thought I was summoned to talk passionately about liquor?

14
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:17,056
"Yuka Tokuzumi, Kagoshima Nichiuri TV Announcer" -Yes, sir.

15
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:18,456
But about the most popular type of liquor

16
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:20,557
that is going around now.

17
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:27,156
Well, when it comes to the charm of wine,

18
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:29,056
-one cannot talk about it without mentioning -It's not wine... but...

19
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:30,256
the amount of polyphenol that it contains...

20
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:32,956
This is an important commemorative event for our program.

21
00:02:32,957 --> 00:02:35,156
"Yousuke Kondo, Shogo Yoshidome" -and what's with all the gibberish.

22
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:37,756
Well... we asked him to come because he is quite well known

23
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,056
and loves to drink.

24
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:40,756
I mean, it's so obvious when Kagoshima comes into the picture

25
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:43,056
and it's about liquor.

26
00:02:43,057 --> 00:02:45,856
The announcer's crying.

27
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:47,557
Dad, come on.

28
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:50,756
What's this threatening feeling I sense

29
00:02:50,757 --> 00:02:52,757
after coming all this way to Kagoshima?

30
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:55,256
Kagoshima...

31
00:02:55,257 --> 00:02:58,056
Drinking in Kagoshima brings to mind...

32
00:02:58,057 --> 00:02:59,856
"Distilled spirits."

33
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:01,157
Oh, no.

34
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:06,356
Well, beer is good.

35
00:03:06,357 --> 00:03:09,056
And wine is also good, but the fact is,

36
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:12,656
I like distilled spirits best.

37
00:03:12,657 --> 00:03:15,456
Actually, I didn't want any of you out there to realize,

38
00:03:15,457 --> 00:03:19,256
more than you already have, how delicious distilled spirits are.

39
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:21,856
That's why you went out of your way to talk about other liquors?

40
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:24,456
-Oh, so that's what it was! -Oh, so that's what it was!

41
00:03:24,457 --> 00:03:28,656
But, I, Kogoro Mouri can deceive you no longer.

42
00:03:28,657 --> 00:03:29,856
Among all the distilled spirits,

43
00:03:29,857 --> 00:03:33,856
this Kagoshima made genuine distilled spirit of Satsuma...

44
00:03:33,857 --> 00:03:36,356
is the best!

45
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:40,156
Viva! Kagoshima!

46
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:43,756
All right, Mr. Mouri! Good job.

47
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,057
We were right to invite him over, weren't we?

48
00:03:47,457 --> 00:03:49,457
He somehow made it through.

49
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:52,357
He's an expert at that for sure.

50
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:58,556
"Takakuma", you mean the rare spirit?

51
00:03:58,557 --> 00:04:01,156
Yes. Since the manufacturing of it is completely limited,

52
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,356
it is very hard to get a hold of and is the gem of all liquors.

53
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:07,456
You mean I get to drink that?

54
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:08,856
We asked the brewery and they answered,

55
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:11,656
"If for Mr. Mouri they'd be more than glad to."

56
00:04:11,657 --> 00:04:13,856
We'll cross the Gulf of Kagoshima on the ferry

57
00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:17,056
and go to a place right opposite it called "Tarumizu."

58
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:21,557
I get to drink it, the spirit of my dreams, the rare spirit "Takakuma."

59
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:27,456
It's nothing to cry over.

60
00:04:27,457 --> 00:04:33,257
This is how we ended up getting involved with that devastating case.

61
00:04:35,757 --> 00:04:40,857
"Kogoro Drunk Over Satsuma! (Part 1)"

62
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:44,956
Takakuma Sake Brewery, so this is where it's being made.

63
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:47,656
I thought it was going to be a much bigger place.

64
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:49,456
But, it's beautiful.

65
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:51,556
The sea is right in front too.

66
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,156
Mr. Mouri, here is the head of the family.

67
00:04:54,157 --> 00:04:57,356
I'm sorry to intrude on you suddenly like this.

68
00:04:57,357 --> 00:04:59,256
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

69
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,156
"Satoshi Shiraishi (30)" -Thank you so much for coming, I'm Shiraishi.

70
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:04,056
We've heard a lot about you.

71
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:05,856
"Fumiko Shiraishi (27)" -I'm Fumiko.

72
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:07,856
This is my daughter, Ran.

73
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:09,356
And he's a freeloader...

74
00:05:09,357 --> 00:05:11,356
Oh, come on, Dad.

75
00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:13,557
-He's Conan. -Hello.

76
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:18,556
I guess a sake brewery is no fun for you, is it, sonny?

77
00:05:18,557 --> 00:05:21,056
That's not true, right?

78
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:22,857
I like it very much.

79
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,857
That is Takayama.

80
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:30,656
I see, that's where you got the name of your brewery from.

81
00:05:30,657 --> 00:05:33,157
Please come this way to the office.

82
00:05:34,557 --> 00:05:36,156
Do come along.

83
00:05:36,157 --> 00:05:37,457
Thank you.

84
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,857
If you will excuse me...

85
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:48,357
How do you like the Takakuma?

86
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:54,956
It's delicious. There's no other word for it.

87
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:56,156
It's only sake.

88
00:05:56,157 --> 00:05:58,856
No, no, this is the gem of all sake.

89
00:05:58,857 --> 00:06:00,056
It's splendid.

90
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:05,257
But, it is our pride and joy to make that "mere sake."

91
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:09,656
Preparation for making sake

92
00:06:09,657 --> 00:06:12,856
starts with steaming the washed grains of rice.

93
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:14,657
Rice malt is then mixed in.

94
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:19,556
The rice malt mixture that is completed is put into a vase,

95
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:22,057
then water and yeast is added, and let stand to ferment.

96
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:25,556
Add steamed Statsuma potatoes into the mixture

97
00:06:25,557 --> 00:06:27,856
and ferment even more.

98
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:30,556
The temperature must be kept stable

99
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,656
and the contents must be stirred constantly with a stick

100
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:35,456
to prevent the propagation of unwanted bacteria.

101
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:36,856
Then, it is left to mature,

102
00:06:36,857 --> 00:06:40,357
which after, an appropriate amount of water is added,

103
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:43,456
and the process is finally complete.

104
00:06:43,457 --> 00:06:46,356
There are companies that are mass producing using machines,

105
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:48,957
but as for us, we have stuck to hand-making the sake.

106
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:52,156
Limited production,

107
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:54,356
may sound of the quite nice.

108
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:57,556
But the thing is we can't make more than we are now

109
00:06:57,557 --> 00:06:59,256
if we insist on making something genuine.

110
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:01,956
Right. The genuine made by hand.

111
00:07:01,957 --> 00:07:03,557
It's no wonder it's delicious.

112
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:06,956
Yes?

113
00:07:06,957 --> 00:07:08,956
I'm Maezono from Weekly Entertainment

114
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:11,456
that asked for an interview the other day.

115
00:07:11,457 --> 00:07:12,556
Interview?

116
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,856
No, I know nothing about it.

117
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:16,856
"Hitomi Maezono (25)" -I talked to a clerk.

118
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:18,357
"Journalist" -called Mr. Tatsumura.

119
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:25,957
What's the change over the moment the name Tatsumura was mentioned?

120
00:07:27,057 --> 00:07:30,756
I came here to film the preparation process.

121
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:31,856
The preparation process?

122
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:34,456
Did Mr. Tatsumura give you permission to do that?

123
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:37,256
"Seiichi Orita, Daisuke Kosugi" -Just what the heck is on his mind?

124
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,656
How can he make such a stupid promise on his own.

125
00:07:39,657 --> 00:07:43,556
I'm sorry to say that we cannot show anyone the preparation process.

126
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:45,956
You can't? But...

127
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:48,556
The greatest enemy for the sake making process

128
00:07:48,557 --> 00:07:50,756
is bacterial contamination from outside.

129
00:07:50,757 --> 00:07:53,056
So, no one other than the one who makes the sake

130
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:54,957
is allowed inside during the process.

131
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:57,256
I guess so.

132
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,956
It's true that people are carriers of various bacteria.

133
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:01,956
That's common sense.

134
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:07,656
I'm sorry, I took on the interview because I love distilled spirits,

135
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:09,956
but how ignorant of me.

136
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,956
We're not angry at you.

137
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:14,656
We're pissed at Manager Tatsumura.

138
00:08:14,657 --> 00:08:18,256
Hey, what's all the shouting about, Kosugi.

139
00:08:18,257 --> 00:08:19,756
-Mr. Tatsumura. -Mr. Tatsumura.

140
00:08:19,757 --> 00:08:21,856
"Shinsuke Tatsumura (45)" -Well, well, it sure looks like.

141
00:08:21,857 --> 00:08:23,556
"Takakuma Brewey Manager" -I'm not very welcome here?

142
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:25,756
Are you Ms. Maezono?

143
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:26,757
Yes.

144
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:29,356
I'm so sorry that I'm late.

145
00:08:29,357 --> 00:08:35,456
You see, the physical exam took longer than I expected...

146
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:38,256
I'm sure you're surprised at how small our brewery is.

147
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:39,856
Oh, sort of...

148
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:42,456
But, we're thinking of re-building it,

149
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:47,256
so that we can mechanize everything in order to mass produce.

150
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:48,756
You mean, Takakuma?

151
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:51,356
Mass produce...

152
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:53,856
Mr. Tatsumura, I've told you time and again

153
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:55,456
that we're not thinking of doing something like that.

154
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:58,856
Mass production will surely bring down the quality of its taste.

155
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:01,756
As you can see, we've got a stubborn president.

156
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:03,356
Distilled spirits is the "in" thing now.

157
00:09:03,357 --> 00:09:06,356
If we don't mass produce now and make big cash, what's in it for us.

158
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:10,857
I think it's not a very good idea to mass produce.

159
00:09:12,857 --> 00:09:16,856
I'll think about whether I really want to interview this situation.

160
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,756
Goodbye.

161
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:20,856
Wait, I figured it would have advertising benefits

162
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:23,156
and I was counting on it too.

163
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:26,856
Why don't you try to love the liquor of your brewery a little more?

164
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:27,857
You're not even thinking

165
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,256
about possibility of the taste of Takakuma being spoiled.

166
00:09:30,257 --> 00:09:31,957
I can't allow that!

167
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,056
Okay, shall we all go back to work too, then.

168
00:09:37,057 --> 00:09:40,256
Even if it's not brought in from the outside,

169
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:42,056
unwanted bacteria is already inside from some time in the past.

170
00:09:42,057 --> 00:09:44,656
Unwanted bacteria, talking about me.

171
00:09:44,657 --> 00:09:46,756
I tell you, you're all the same.

172
00:09:46,757 --> 00:09:51,256
I'm against mechanizing the making of hand-made sake too.

173
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,356
Who are you?

174
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:55,757
Thank you for everything today.

175
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,756
Wait up, if I remember correctly...

176
00:10:02,757 --> 00:10:06,656
That's right! You're the renown detective, Kogoro Mouri!

177
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:09,156
You're just the guy.

178
00:10:09,157 --> 00:10:10,956
Wait, please wait!

179
00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:14,856
An image character to advertise the product?

180
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:16,756
I was looking for someone

181
00:10:16,757 --> 00:10:19,756
who would match the image of our product.

182
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:21,956
If you agree to accept to do it,

183
00:10:21,957 --> 00:10:24,756
I'll send you as much sake as you want.

184
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,156
You mean that Takakuma?

185
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:28,156
Dad, don't tell me that you're going to?

186
00:10:28,157 --> 00:10:31,057
Well, but, you see...

187
00:10:32,057 --> 00:10:35,256
When it comes to sake, he's got super weak will power.

188
00:10:35,257 --> 00:10:38,756
That's right, I'll take you around tomorrow.

189
00:10:38,757 --> 00:10:40,256
It's my day off,

190
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:42,256
so I'll treat you to some place good to eat.

191
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:45,757
Please do accept my offer, okay, okay?

192
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:50,756
Mr. Mouri, let me do that for you.

193
00:10:50,757 --> 00:10:52,056
Mrs. Shiraishi.

194
00:10:52,057 --> 00:10:55,656
It's a token of my gratitude for you liking our sake so much.

195
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:57,957
Please let me take you around.

196
00:10:59,257 --> 00:11:02,156
Well, I guess a woman guide is more enjoyable.

197
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:04,756
I guess I'll leave it up to Mrs. Shiraishi then,

198
00:11:04,757 --> 00:11:07,956
and relax as I was planning to anyway.

199
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:10,857
Mr. Mouri, I'll be waiting for a good answer.

200
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:22,156
Dad!

201
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:24,757
Why didn't you refuse him flatly?

202
00:11:26,657 --> 00:11:29,657
It's Takamori Saigo, awesome!

203
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,756
Goodness, you always avoid things you can't handle.

204
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:37,356
But for some reason I don't like that man called Mr. Tatsumura.

205
00:11:37,357 --> 00:11:39,957
The others don't seem to like him much either.

206
00:11:41,757 --> 00:11:44,056
It is more than that.

207
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:46,156
He utterly despised.

208
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:50,557
But why do Mr. and Mrs. Shirashi keep him as a staff?

209
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,672
"Shiroyama Grand Hotel."

210
00:11:57,735 --> 00:12:00,434
The winds on Sakurajima are blowing quite strongly today.

211
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:04,934
They even forecast the direction of the wind in Kagoshima.

212
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:07,334
Oh, yeah.

213
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:09,634
I wonder for what, though?

214
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:10,935
Because ashes come falling.

215
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:15,135
-Good morning. -Good morning.

216
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,134
The ashes of Sakurajima ride the wind and fly,

217
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:21,134
so hanging the laundry out when the wind is blowing

218
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:22,435
would be a disaster, right?

219
00:12:23,435 --> 00:12:26,134
So that's why the direction of the wind is a problem.

220
00:12:26,135 --> 00:12:27,935
I wonder if ashes will come flying today too?

221
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:30,634
Nobody knows,

222
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:32,334
because the wind's capricious.

223
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,835
Wow, how'd they write it?

224
00:12:37,635 --> 00:12:39,634
-Mrs. Shiraishi? -Yes?

225
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:44,234
How come the man called Mr. Tatsumura doesn't get fired?

226
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:47,034
What the heck's the matter with you, brat?

227
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:48,334
Conan!

228
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,734
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:54,034
I guess even a child would think there's something strange about it.

230
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:57,034
But, we can't fire him

231
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:58,834
because we owe a lot to him from the past.

232
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:00,635
Owe a lot to him from the past?

233
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:05,434
Our brewery has a history.

234
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:08,834
But, we're a small brewery without a name to begin with,

235
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:11,834
so our product didn't sell too well...

236
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:16,234
If things were left as is, we would've been out of business long ago.

237
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:17,734
We somehow made it to where we are now,

238
00:13:17,735 --> 00:13:21,234
thanks to Mr. Tatsumura who is in charge of sales

239
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:22,935
going all out selling our products.

240
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:29,734
Still, we are unable to face up

241
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:31,334
to the major manufacturer's production ability

242
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:33,234
of low profit high sales way of business.

243
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:37,834
We were finally faced with going out of business 10 years ago,

244
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:41,134
that was 5 years before I got married.

245
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:43,834
Back then, my father-in-law, the predecessor, and my husband,

246
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:48,835
who was still an apprentice, came to a decision...

247
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:51,934
If this was to be it,

248
00:13:51,935 --> 00:13:53,834
they decided to do as they really wished to do.

249
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:55,434
And that was to be really particular about the ingredients

250
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,134
and the method the sake is made.

251
00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:59,134
They decided to close the Takakuma Brewery

252
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:02,034
only after they made the best liquor they could ever make.

253
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:04,034
And that's the Takakuma.

254
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:05,534
Yes. And,

255
00:14:05,535 --> 00:14:07,634
it was recognized as "genuine".

256
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:10,734
Everybody's waiting for the real thing.

257
00:14:10,735 --> 00:14:12,234
But, in winter of last year,

258
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:13,834
because of his long years of strain from worry,

259
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:15,034
the predecessor passed away...

260
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:19,734
Don't you forget what we decided on 10 years ago.

261
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:20,735
Yes, sir!

262
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:24,634
That's about when a change came about Mr. Tatsumura.

263
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:27,034
What? Mass production?

264
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:30,334
Customer's come asking for the brand name Takakuma.

265
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:33,434
They wouldn't know the difference if the quality of taste drops a little.

266
00:14:33,435 --> 00:14:35,634
Business! Business!

267
00:14:35,635 --> 00:14:37,034
What a thing to say.

268
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:39,734
Are you going to allow him to talk like that, president?

269
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:41,334
He's going to spoil our liquor.

270
00:14:41,335 --> 00:14:42,934
We'd better drive him out of here.

271
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:44,534
Dear.

272
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:49,534
I can't. We were rescued from going out of business thanks to him.

273
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:52,535
We're obliged to him and I will never forget that.

274
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,434
You sure are stubborn.

275
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:58,634
My husband is not really all that good at getting ahead.

276
00:14:58,635 --> 00:15:00,434
He never forgets what someone has done for him.

277
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:02,034
He sure is a man of Statsuma.

278
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,535
He's fantastic.

279
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:09,634
Mr. Mouri, please refuse what Mr. Tatsuma asked you to do yesterday.

280
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:11,734
If a famous person like you, Mr. Mouri

281
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:16,334
cooperates with advertising the product, he can't lose.

282
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:18,734
I'm sure that he will force his way through

283
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:21,334
to mechanizing the process and start mass production.

284
00:15:21,335 --> 00:15:23,034
I see.

285
00:15:23,035 --> 00:15:25,934
You decided to take over showing me around

286
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:28,734
to ask me not to listen to him.

287
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:30,134
I'm sorry.

288
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:33,034
Well, I was planning to refuse anyway!

289
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:35,334
Of course, from the very start...

290
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:37,035
Isn't it?

291
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:48,034
Mr. Tatsumura lives in Kagoshima city.

292
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:50,135
I'm glad, he seems to be home.

293
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:55,434
6:00 pm.

294
00:15:55,435 --> 00:15:57,434
Does Mr. Tatsumura have a family?

295
00:15:57,435 --> 00:16:00,435
No, he lives alone.

296
00:16:02,835 --> 00:16:04,035
It's open.

297
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:07,534
I'll go check inside.

298
00:16:07,535 --> 00:16:10,235
Mr. Tatsumura, this is Fumiko.

299
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:14,534
Doesn't something feel sandy?

300
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:16,434
Now that you mentioned it...

301
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,935
It's probably the ashes.

302
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:22,335
Oh no.

303
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:25,135
His car's not here.

304
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:28,535
Mrs. Shiraishi!

305
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:31,135
What's the matter?

306
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:36,635
This is...

307
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,334
It's blood.

308
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,135
Don't tell me it's... Mr. Tatsumura's?

309
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:57,634
I can imagine just about what happened.

310
00:16:57,635 --> 00:17:01,435
When Mr. Tatsumura was relaxing on his day off...

311
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:12,634
Judging from the circumstances,

312
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:14,935
this is a case of kidnapping.

313
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,934
And, when you all came here,

314
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:21,734
the fact that the lights were on

315
00:17:21,735 --> 00:17:25,234
means that he was taken away some time after sundown.

316
00:17:25,235 --> 00:17:27,534
I can give a more exact time.

317
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:31,934
When I confirmed the time, the blood stain wasn't dry yet.

318
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:33,234
That means the time of the murder

319
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:36,534
was right before 6:00 when we found him.

320
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:40,234
I see, Ohatakeyama, pursue the car on the double.

321
00:17:40,235 --> 00:17:41,235
Yes, sir!

322
00:17:42,735 --> 00:17:48,634
Weren't you a nurse at the Chuo Hospital before?

323
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:51,635
Yes. I was, until 5 years ago when I got married.

324
00:17:53,935 --> 00:17:56,934
So you are the nurse I saw back then.

325
00:17:56,935 --> 00:17:58,934
-Hurry up and get going! -Yes, sir!

326
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:00,835
"Shiroyama Grand Hotel"

327
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,735
I'm sorry I got you messed up in something bothersome.

328
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:11,534
You must be worried.

329
00:18:11,535 --> 00:18:13,534
He may have been a bit of trouble,

330
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:16,234
but after all Mr. Tatsumura did help you out so...

331
00:18:16,235 --> 00:18:17,634
If the kidnapper is after money,

332
00:18:17,635 --> 00:18:20,134
he'll surely call to demand ransom.

333
00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:22,235
When he does, we'll nail him...

334
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:27,735
However, there was no contact from the kidnapper the following day.

335
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:33,034
I wonder why the kidnapper's not making contact?

336
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:36,034
And, another day went by...

337
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:38,934
The prefectural police received an anonymous call,

338
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:42,935
saying that Mr. Tatsumura, would be found at Terayama Park in the city.

339
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:51,234
Mr. Tatsumura!

340
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:55,834
This is not a place where people would normally set foot in.

341
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:58,534
The caller was probably the killer.

342
00:18:58,535 --> 00:18:59,834
The voice seems to have been a made-up voice,

343
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:01,634
in which you could not make out the gender.

344
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:04,835
Kidnap and murder... what a guy.

345
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:07,734
Dead for two days?

346
00:19:07,735 --> 00:19:09,934
Yes, according to the result of the autopsy,

347
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:13,534
he was killed two days ago, that is on that day.

348
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,134
Two days having past,

349
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:18,634
it's hard to determine an accurate estimate,

350
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:20,034
but there seems to be no doubt that the time of death

351
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,934
is between sundown to night that day.

352
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:25,534
The cause of his death was from a blow to the back of his head

353
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:28,335
and he seems to have died instantly with one blow.

354
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,034
What?

355
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:33,834
The figurine that was on the floor of the living room,

356
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:37,334
the traces on the figurine and his head matched perfectly

357
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:39,234
and the blood stains that were found

358
00:19:39,235 --> 00:19:44,234
were Mr. Tatsumura's so it's no doubt that it is the murder weapon.

359
00:19:44,235 --> 00:19:45,734
Wait a minute.

360
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:47,734
If Mr. Tatsumura died instantly with one blow to his head,

361
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:49,834
it means that the killer didn't strike him

362
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:52,334
and pass him out,

363
00:19:52,335 --> 00:19:54,234
then take him away but...

364
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,934
killed him on the spot, took him away

365
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:58,835
and abandoned his car at the park, dead body and all.

366
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:03,734
Then, two days later today, the killer,

367
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,434
calls from his side to notify the police of Mr. Tatsumura's whereabouts.

368
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:07,234
That's the story.

369
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:09,034
There must be some reason why the killer

370
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:12,334
went out of the way to carry Mr. Tatsumura out of the house.

371
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:15,134
Moreover, the killer notified the police of Mr. Tatsumura's whereabouts.

372
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:17,334
But, why?

373
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:20,134
And, according the report by the forensic officers,

374
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,934
all the doors and windows of Mr. Tatsumura's house

375
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:25,935
had no traces of being forced opened.

376
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:29,434
Besides, the locks to his house were all special types

377
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:31,934
that spare keys could not be made.

378
00:20:31,935 --> 00:20:35,434
If so, how did the killer make it into the house?

379
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,435
There is only one way.

380
00:20:39,435 --> 00:20:41,935
That is, the killer and Mr. Tatsumura knew each other.

381
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,535
As to this case,

382
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:49,234
no cash had been stolen, so it is not a case of robbery.

383
00:20:49,235 --> 00:20:51,534
The only thing thinkable is a grudge.

384
00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:54,334
Somebody hated him enough to want to kill him.

385
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:56,634
And, moreover, it was someone who was around him.

386
00:20:56,635 --> 00:20:57,935
Which means...

387
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:03,235
What? The killer is among us?

388
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:09,634
We can't find anybody who had a grudge against Mr. Tatsumura

389
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,534
other than the people of this brewery.

390
00:21:12,535 --> 00:21:15,734
Then, why do I have to be suspected too?

391
00:21:15,735 --> 00:21:18,334
We know that you held ill feelings against Mr. Tatsumura

392
00:21:18,335 --> 00:21:20,234
from the information we got asking around.

393
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:21,734
No.

394
00:21:21,735 --> 00:21:26,734
Of course we had a grudge against him. We all did, but...

395
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:30,134
He was killed at sundown the day before yesterday, right?

396
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:34,435
Then, all of us here were in the brewery working.

397
00:21:36,135 --> 00:21:38,434
I thought I already told you

398
00:21:38,435 --> 00:21:39,835
that everyone was working and...

399
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:45,435
It could be that you're all matching your story up together too.

400
00:21:47,135 --> 00:21:48,934
And, Ms. Maezono,

401
00:21:48,935 --> 00:21:51,634
since you say that you were in your hotel room alone,

402
00:21:51,635 --> 00:21:53,635
your alibi hasn't been backed up yet.

403
00:21:55,535 --> 00:21:57,834
We don't want to suspect any of you,

404
00:21:57,835 --> 00:22:01,434
but what Officer Shinfuku is saying abides to logical reasoning.

405
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:02,634
Dad!

406
00:22:02,635 --> 00:22:06,734
It's true that no one here has a definite alibi.

407
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:10,235
And, everyone hates Mr. Tatsumura.

408
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:13,434
I'll bet Mrs. Shiraishi is in agony,

409
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:16,235
being that everyone close to her is being suspected.

410
00:22:19,635 --> 00:22:21,734
But...

411
00:22:21,735 --> 00:22:26,235
I'm sure the killer is among the people here.

412
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:57,334
"Next Episode" -Sake is a "living creature."

413
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:58,634
Once you start preparing it,

414
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:00,834
you can't take your eyes off it.

415
00:24:00,835 --> 00:24:02,934
That's why you can't do something

416
00:24:02,935 --> 00:24:04,834
like leave the brewery to go kill someone.

417
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:06,534
You can't do something like that, can you?

418
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:08,234
Getting right to the point,

419
00:24:08,235 --> 00:24:10,535
that stuff was not found on his clothes at all.

420
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:14,834
Well... so the killer is...

421
00:24:14,835 --> 00:24:18,234
Pops, this is your chance to show everyone your real ability.

422
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:19,634
I guess.

423
00:24:19,635 --> 00:24:21,034
Next Conan,

425
