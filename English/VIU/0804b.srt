1
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,129
Who is it?

2
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,529
Yes?

3
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,729
Mr. Hosoo. What's up, this early in the day?

4
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,529
Yes. What?

5
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,429
All right. I'll be right over.

6
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,829
What's the matter?

7
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,329
Was that call from Mr. Hosoo?

8
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,630
Yeah.

9
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,330
His secretary, Mr. Takahashi, committed suicide.

10
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,829
Mr. Mouri.

11
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,629
I asked him to come.

12
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,229
Why did Mr. Takahashi commit suicide?

13
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,930
We're not sure that it's suicide yet.

14
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,429
Excuse me.

15
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,829
Mr. Mouri.

16
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,829
I heard that you're not sure it's suicide yet.

17
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,329
Why?

18
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,829
This.

19
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,329
What's with that string?

20
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,229
It was wound around the electrical fan of the radiator.

21
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,429
And as you can see, it's severed like so.

22
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,829
And?

23
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,829
It was found around Mr. Takahashi's neck.

24
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,330
His neck...

25
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,829
How awful.

26
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,329
If the string hadn't snapped, this side would've...

27
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,329
From here, he passed it through the headrest of the driver's seat

28
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,929
and wound it around his neck.

29
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,329
The end was tied onto the steering wheel.

30
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,829
I see.

31
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,629
When the engine was started,

32
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,929
the string is wound and strangles him.

33
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,529
I'm surprised that he was able to push the starter switch.

34
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,529
I guess he wasn't choked right away.

35
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,530
What?

36
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:14,329
The electrical fan of the radiator

37
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,429
doesn't move right after the engine is started.

38
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,129
I see.

39
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,729
It takes time before the coolant heats up and the sensor to responds.

40
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,029
Yes, especially because it's cold now.

41
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,329
It takes time before the fan starts running.

42
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,929
Why? Why deliberately...

43
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,529
Is it from fear?

44
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,429
No, not so!

45
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,729
This is homicide!

46
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,329
I thought so.

47
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,529
You don't need time lag to commit suicide, do you?

48
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,429
We occasionally agree on things.

49
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,929
Either way, we've got to investigate the cause of death first.

50
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,129
If worse comes to worst,

51
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,729
we may find something strange in his stomach.

52
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,629
You mean something other than strangulation?

53
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,229
That case...

54
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,730
If I remember correctly, it had the two-faced mask inside.

55
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,929
Since when were you here?

56
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,429
I... I wonder since when.

57
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,929
Don't let me repeat myself!

58
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,929
This is not something a child should see.

59
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,729
Wasn't the mask in that case?

60
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,429
Are you listening or what?

61
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,130
I'm listening.

62
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,129
I'm not mistaken.

63
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,429
That case is the one that President Yabusaki...

64
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,830
I'll take this then.

65
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,029
It's the Kabukiza.

66
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,929
We work for the same company.

67
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,529
You can't, not now.

68
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,829
But...

69
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,129
Please cooperate.

70
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,730
Please.

71
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,729
"Yukari Shioji (32), HO Trading accounting secretary"

72
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,329
Miss.

73
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,930
Are you all right?

74
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,130
I'm fine, Sonny.

75
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,029
-Ms. Shioji. -President!

76
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,230
Mr. Takahashi... Is he really...

77
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,530
I see.

78
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,529
Inspector Shiratori, good morning.

79
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,229
Good morning, Conan.

80
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,329
Is the mask missing?

81
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,729
You're quickly informed as usual, aren't you?

82
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,229
"Takuzo Minowa (55), Security guard"

83
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,029
-What's the matter? -They took my fingerprints.

84
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,329
I wonder if they suspect me.

85
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,129
That's not it.

86
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,729
Because all the people who entered this room had their fingerprints taken.

87
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,629
He's right.

88
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,129
If prints other than yours are found,

89
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,929
it'll help move the investigation along.

90
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,629
I see.

91
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,129
I doubt they'll find anything this time, though.

92
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,429
No prints were detected?

93
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,029
No, it seems the perp wore vinyl gloves.

94
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,429
According to Mr. Tome,

95
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,029
the unevenness of the surface of the leather would've been left behind,

96
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,129
if it were leather.

97
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,929
Vinyl gloves?

98
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,029
The ordinary easy to get kind?

99
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,029
Was the mask found in there?

100
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,229
In Mr. Yabusaki's locker.

101
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,829
He, himself found it in there this morning.

102
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,429
May I ask you something, sir?

103
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,830
What is it?

104
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,229
From here to that staff entrance...

105
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,630
Great detective!

106
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,129
Ebizo.

107
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,030
Did you come up with anything?

108
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,529
About Mr. Takahashi...

109
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,629
Mr. Mouri says it's not suicide.

110
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,829
Yeah.

111
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,229
What was thought to be a case of theft turns out to be homicide.

112
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,529
Nothing's for sure yet,

113
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,629
but if it were suicide,

114
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,029
it's strange that the two-faced mask is missing from the case, right?

115
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,329
Right.

116
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,229
If Takahashi himself stole it,

117
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,229
it should be in there.

118
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,929
It's obvious that a third party took it,

119
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,129
either to sell it or to keep it for himself.

120
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,529
Someone who knows the value of the two-faced mask.

121
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,929
Someone who knew that it was inside the president's locker.

122
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,529
Doesn't that narrow things down quite a bit?

123
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,929
Yes.

124
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,129
Is something bothering you?

125
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,929
The locker was violently opened,

126
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,829
but the other locks are in tack.

127
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,029
-The other locks? -Yes.

128
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,429
Mr. Minowa went home last night at 23:30.

129
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,429
The entire building's security system was activated

130
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,429
and the front door was locked at the same time.

131
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,029
Although there are many people who have cards,

132
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,029
only Mr. Minowa and the receptionists

133
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,429
have keys to go on ahead.

134
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,729
Which means the perp is an expert at picking locks?

135
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,429
I guess so.

136
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,629
The perp broke in without even scratching the newest cylinder type and yet,

137
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,529
to break open a simple lock like that of the locker with a bar...

138
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,430
I see, it sure is weird.

139
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,929
Somebody who can get a hold of key of this place...

140
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,929
It seems that person also knows the position of the security cameras.

141
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,029
You figured something like that out too?

142
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:07,329
Oh, so you were searching for that route till just a while ago.

143
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,330
Yes.

144
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:11,229
There's a camera in here too, right?

145
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,229
Although security is tight around the backstage dressing rooms,

146
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,229
so long as I didn't use the elevator,

147
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,630
I was able to make into the locker room without being caught on camera.

148
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,529
I guess. You'd be able to.

149
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:29,329
Because there's nothing valuable in the rooms of the presidents.

150
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,230
Can you tell what this is?

151
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,229
What're these figures?

152
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:39,429
Mr. Minowa said that they're the PIN for the door outside.

153
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,929
He found it on the floor of that room.

154
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,829
Why didn't you give it to the police?

155
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,529
Can you have Mr. Mouri check on it?

156
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,729
I'm being suspected by the police, right?

157
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,529
They don't suspect him.

158
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,329
He was serious.

159
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,430
What?

160
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,129
-Look on the back. -The back?

161
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,729
It's the script from our previous performance.

162
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,029
This is a script.

163
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,829
We cut used scripts into memo paper.

164
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,829
Playwright Iwami does it.

165
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,130
-Your seatbelt. -Yes, sir.

166
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,730
-Let's go, buddy! -Buddy?

167
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:33,729
Great detective, is Iwami your prime suspect?

168
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,629
No, if he acted alone.

169
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,229
This case started

170
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,929
when someone tampered with the brakes of Mr. Hosoo's car.

171
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,729
Next was his secretary, Mr. Takahashi.

172
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,629
Again the car was tampered in a complicated way.

173
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:55,529
And if the small bar that was used to destroy the locker

174
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,629
was a wheel spanner that you'd find in an onboard toolkit...

175
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,329
I see.

176
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,029
The perp knows a lot about cars.

177
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,729
It's hard to believe that Mr. Iwami is the perp

178
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,929
because he doesn't have a driver's license.

179
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,729
When did you check whether Iwami had a license or not?

180
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,129
It wasn't me.

181
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,729
Pops Kogoro seems to have asked to check on it.

182
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,629
You say so,

183
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:24,630
but I'll bet you're the one solving the cases behind the scenes.

184
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,630
This is no laughing matter.

185
00:10:42,428 --> 00:10:45,428
"HO Trading Office"

186
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:53,327
"President's room" -Your bodyguard?

187
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:55,327
My car brakes were destroyed

188
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:57,727
and I was almost killed.

189
00:10:57,728 --> 00:11:01,727
And now my secretary, Takahashi, was really killed.

190
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:06,127
Suicide hasn't been ruled out yet.

191
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:09,427
He's not the type to commit suicide.

192
00:11:09,428 --> 00:11:11,227
Even when I chewed him out,

193
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:15,227
the following day he would act as if nothing had happened.

194
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:19,127
It's highly likely that they'd come after me again.

195
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:23,127
Okay, I understand. I accept.

196
00:11:23,128 --> 00:11:24,628
I'm glad!

197
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:27,627
Come in.

198
00:11:27,628 --> 00:11:29,328
Excuse me.

199
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:32,227
Good morning, President.

200
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:33,927
I've got two messages for you.

201
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:37,727
I've just been asked to serve as bodyguard for the president.

202
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:40,127
Mr. Kogoro Mouri, correct?

203
00:11:40,128 --> 00:11:44,127
Yes, I'm a great detective, you see.

204
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:46,127
What kind of shampoo do you use?

205
00:11:46,128 --> 00:11:48,127
I'd like to talk to the president in private.

206
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:49,227
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:50,527
We'll be done right away,

208
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:52,827
so please wait for me in the meeting area.

209
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:56,627
Who knows where they'd be targeting you from.

210
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:58,827
I'd like you to introduce me to a sniper

211
00:11:58,828 --> 00:12:00,427
that's such a sharp shooter.

212
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,727
What?

213
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:04,627
I'm only joking.

214
00:12:04,628 --> 00:12:05,927
And you are?

215
00:12:05,928 --> 00:12:07,727
Yukari Shioji.

216
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,928
I'm in charge of accounting.

217
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:18,127
She knew me.

218
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,827
Kaori Shioji.

219
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:23,128
She smelled nice.

220
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,527
"Poroit Hospital"

221
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:29,727
This is where they brought Iwami.

222
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:33,327
I'd like to talk to him where it's nice and quiet.

223
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:34,328
What do you mean?

224
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:36,927
Because you stand out, Ebizo.

225
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:38,727
How's this disguise?

226
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:40,327
No darn way!

227
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:42,127
Really?

228
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,927
Dr. Terajima...

229
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:47,027
Please return to the medical office.

230
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:48,327
I repeat.

231
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:50,427
Dr. Terajima, please return to...

232
00:12:50,428 --> 00:12:53,328
It's impossible to erase aura, I guess.

233
00:12:54,928 --> 00:12:57,627
-This floor? -Room 11.

234
00:12:57,628 --> 00:12:59,827
"Shinnosuke Iwami"

235
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:01,827
No! Mr. Iwami!

236
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:03,527
No, don't!

237
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:06,227
Somebody! Somebody, help!

238
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:07,528
Iwami!

239
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:10,028
What do you think you're doing?

240
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:13,728
You!

241
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,327
Just what is wrong with you, Iwami?

242
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:20,627
Ebizo...

243
00:13:20,628 --> 00:13:22,628
I'm sorry.

244
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:26,827
Are you all right, nurse?

245
00:13:26,828 --> 00:13:30,727
Yes. He sure is a hard patient to handle, really.

246
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:31,828
Huh?

247
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:35,527
Dr. Kikuchi.

248
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:37,227
Not again.

249
00:13:37,228 --> 00:13:38,828
Yes.

250
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:49,128
Maybe it's my fault.

251
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:55,427
I believed in his gift and chose him.

252
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:57,927
But maybe for him,

253
00:13:57,928 --> 00:14:01,928
it was nothing but pressure.

254
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:06,727
Ebizo.

255
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:09,628
I'll investigate on my own from here.

256
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:14,327
And, why?

257
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:17,527
It's tough having to doubt

258
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:19,328
the people you work with, isn't it?

259
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,828
And you're still just a child.

260
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:29,128
But you read people's minds.

261
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:32,328
You're Ebizo after all.

262
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:36,327
The doctor injected Mr. Iwami with a tranquilizer

263
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:38,727
and said that he's fine.

264
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:42,827
-Thank you very much. -You're very welcome.

265
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:44,327
What're you going to do from now?

266
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:46,127
I'll give you a lift.

267
00:14:46,128 --> 00:14:48,527
Thank you. But I'll be fine.

268
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:50,328
I go on my own from here.

269
00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:53,527
Okay.

270
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:55,227
I'll tell everybody to answer you honestly,

271
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,727
if you come to investigate on something.

272
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:02,527
Hang in there, little great detective.

273
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:03,928
I will.

274
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,660
"Poroit Hospital"

275
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,159
Did Mr. Iwami try to jump yesterday too?

276
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,659
How do you know?

277
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,459
Because when the doctor came into the room,

278
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,459
he said, "Not again".

279
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,260
Oh, I see.

280
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,359
It was when I went to check the IV at the wee hour of the night,

281
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,459
so maybe it was around 3:00.

282
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,059
You got to be joking!

283
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,360
I quit, you fool!

284
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,860
-Forget this play! -Mr. Iwami?

285
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,359
Look out!

286
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,259
Let go! Let me go!

287
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,960
No!

288
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,559
You mean he attempted suicide?

289
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,459
Well, it seems like he's kind of acting it out too,

290
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,360
but there are patients like that sometimes, so...

291
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,360
What're you sniffing around for?

292
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,859
What're you doing, sir?

293
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,659
I'm a cameraman.

294
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,259
My job is...

295
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,559
to record the next performance.

296
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,859
I've got nothing to do with it, do I?

297
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,159
You've already stuck your nose into this.

298
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,559
You may not get off that easily.

299
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,759
Sir, you're not a cameraman,

300
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,059
but rather a detective, right?

301
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,159
When you look at people through the viewfinder,

302
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,160
you can really clearly see them inside out.

303
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,359
That's why cameramen are paid well.

304
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,759
Before the police come to cover the objects with blue sheets,

305
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,759
I got this from the roof of a building nearby.

306
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
And this.

307
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,660
Nice eyes.

308
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,759
Did you find any will?

309
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,659
If this is concluded as suicide, the story ends here.

310
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,059
If it were suicide, it would've been done more simply.

311
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,859
You understand, don't you, kid?

312
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,059
Thanks.

313
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,759
Be careful.

314
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,659
Friend or foe. If you get them wrong,

315
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,360
it may cost you your life.

316
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,359
That cameraman...

317
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,960
Just what does he know?

318
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,460
This is too much.

319
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:05,059
Thank you for waiting.

320
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,559
Ms. Kaori Shiojiri.

321
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,359
It's Yukari Shioji.

322
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,759
I'd like to talk to you about Mr. Takahashi,

323
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,659
just the two of us.

324
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,259
Yes?

325
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,859
Mr. Mouri, I have to go to Ginza for a business negotiation,

326
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,759
so please come with me.

327
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,459
Of course.

328
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,959
Come, let's go, Kaori.

329
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,559
It's Yukari.

330
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,259
Ms. Shiojii has to stay here

331
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,659
because she's got accounting work to take care of.

332
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,959
No way.

333
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,759
Mr. Mouri.

334
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,460
Yes, sir!

335
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,059
I can't get a hold of Mr. Kaneko.

336
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,859
We've got a problem.

337
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,259
Mr. Kaneko? You mean the cameraman, right?

338
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,260
Yeah.

339
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:55,759
I met him at the hospital where Mr. Iwami's staying,

340
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,059
just a while ago.

341
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,760
-Really? -Thank you, Conan.

342
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,859
Is something wrong with Mr. Kaneko?

343
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,860
There are lots of bad rumors going around about him.

344
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
"Ran Mouri" -Ran?

345
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,459
What's the matter, Ran?

346
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,659
Where are you now?

347
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,759
You've got something more fun to do

348
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,059
than playing soccer with us?

349
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,259
Hey, wait.

350
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,459
Ran told us about it, you know?

351
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,959
That only you went to a sushi shop in Ichikawa.

352
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,159
That's Pops' comical story.

353
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,959
-You went to the sushi shop with Kanizo! -It's Ebizo!

354
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,860
Give it back to me!

355
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,360
I can't go home for a while yet.

356
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,559
What's the matter?

357
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,659
Did you give it to Mr. Mouri for me?

358
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,859
Yes, I'm going to give it to him from now.

359
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,859
Please do so, okay?

360
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,459
I can't sleep like this.

361
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,759
Oh, right.

362
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,059
Do you know Mr. Kaneko's cell phone number?

363
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,760
Pops Kogoro told me to ask you.

364
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,459
You answer the phone if it's me.

365
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,559
I answered because it was a number I wasn't familiar with.

366
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,459
Or rather you could call it a hunch.

367
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,759
I was so sure it was you.

368
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,959
Didn't the police call you too?

369
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,559
Detectives got to have a keen nose, you see.

370
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,759
I'd like to ask you a lot of questions as a detective.

371
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,559
For example?

372
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,459
I want to know how you took pictures of Mr. Takahashi when he died.

373
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,160
Sure, great detective.

374
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,260
Why would he be in a place like this?

375
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,660
Who is it?

376
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,360
Shoots!

377
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,559
"Next Episode" -The two-faced mask that we borrowed from Mr. Hosoo

378
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,059
had been stolen.

379
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,359
However,

380
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,559
I can't let that hold me back after I've come this far!

381
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,159
I'll need to turn this performance into a success no matter what!

382
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,859
The most unsuspicious one

383
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,359
is in fact the most suspicious.

384
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,459
Dad, big trouble!

385
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,359
What about the glasses kid?

386
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,759
He's missing?

387
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,059
Next Conan,

388
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,160
"Conan and Ebizo's Kabuki Juhachiban Mystery (Part 2)"

389
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,759
Next Conan's Hint:

390
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,659
"Jacket"

391
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,259
-We are... -All five of us...

392
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,760
Makes 30!
