1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:02,281
"Kudo."

2
00:00:03,281 --> 00:00:06,280
You can disguise the face and use a voice changer for the voice.

3
00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:07,980
Voice changer?

4
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:10,380
Open the roof.

5
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:11,880
What?

6
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:14,881
Akai, what?

7
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:18,280
-Five seconds. -What?

8
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:20,180
When you get there, hold the steering wheel steady

9
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:22,380
drive at fixed speed for five seconds.

10
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:25,481
I'll put an end to this ridiculous chase.

11
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,780
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

12
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:34,180
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

13
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:35,880
A sink or swim gamble.

14
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,980
Who'll be the first to get to the truth?

15
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:39,580
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,480
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:43,581
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:22,165 --> 00:02:27,365
"The Scarlet Truth."

19
00:02:39,565 --> 00:02:41,364
That boy...

20
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:43,164
You mean Conan?

21
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:44,264
Yeah.

22
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:47,564
In order for them to secure me with the least resistance

23
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:50,364
they would most likely try to capture either one of you

24
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:52,164
who has a deep connection with me.

25
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,564
To carry it out in secret,

26
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:58,364
they came while you were out driving and isolated from other FBI agents.

27
00:02:58,365 --> 00:03:02,964
Knowing that you were suspicious of whether I was dead or not,

28
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:04,864
he assumed that you'd be coming to Raiha Pass,

29
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:07,064
and he was definitely right about it.

30
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:08,764
Camel.

31
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:12,364
After you past the next right curve, it's a straight road for 200 m.

32
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:13,464
Roger!

33
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:15,564
After passing the right curve, I'll keep the steering wheel

34
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:17,264
and speed steady for five seconds!

35
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:18,265
Too reckless!

36
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,864
The tire's flat and the car's swerving, you know?

37
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:23,165
So you can't possibly aim the gun.

38
00:03:24,865 --> 00:03:26,864
No problem.

39
00:03:26,865 --> 00:03:29,664
As long as the movements are regular,

40
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:31,664
they can be calculated.

41
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:33,264
Shu.

42
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:34,565
Right curve!

43
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:37,565
I'm counting on you, Camel.

44
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:43,264
Straight!

45
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,664
Copy.

46
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:45,865
One.

47
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:48,465
Two.

48
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:51,465
Three.

49
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:53,965
Four.

50
00:04:13,765 --> 00:04:15,464
They don't seem to be coming after us.

51
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:17,664
Which means we shook them off.

52
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:19,364
Just as expected of you, Mr. Akai!

53
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:20,964
Camel.

54
00:04:20,965 --> 00:04:22,164
Go back.

55
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:23,964
-What? -Yes, sir!

56
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:26,265
Wait! You're kidding, right?

57
00:04:27,865 --> 00:04:30,964
What? Akai fired a gun?

58
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:32,864
And what about the chase?

59
00:04:32,865 --> 00:04:36,364
About that... Our cars kept stopping.

60
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:37,664
Who cares?

61
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:40,264
If there's a car that can move, go after them!

62
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:41,464
If we lose him now,

63
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:44,764
we don't know where he'll go next time.

64
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:47,264
Could you keep the noise down a bit?

65
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:51,364
The owner of this house has just been awarded a great prize

66
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:54,064
and is about to make a speech right now.

67
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:56,565
I've never met him though.

68
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,064
Thank you.

69
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:03,564
I'm Yusaku Kudo, who he just introduced.

70
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:08,364
I was able to receive this award thanks to everyone

71
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:12,564
who turned a new scriptwriter's screenplay into a superb movie.

72
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:17,664
Thank you to the director, staff, actors and actresses.

73
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:25,564
And what I'd like to remind you of is the model of "The Scarlet Agent".

74
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:27,964
You mean there's a model?

75
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:33,164
Yes. The trouble is my wife is head over heels over him right now.

76
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:36,964
"He's good looking, polite, cool and dandy."

77
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:41,765
"He could probably do a lot more if he weren't an FBI agent."

78
00:05:43,265 --> 00:05:46,365
Is what my wife has been saying.

79
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:51,665
Shinichi's dad is sort of cute.

80
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:56,865
But we have no means of going after them in this situation.

81
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:05,864
Are you okay?

82
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,364
Akai...

83
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:09,664
Akai? Hey?

84
00:06:09,665 --> 00:06:12,064
Is Akai there? Hey?

85
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:14,264
No offense.

86
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:16,964
After all, you're the guys that came after us.

87
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:21,964
I didn't want anyone to get hurt, so I had to do it.

88
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,764
I've got a proposal to make.

89
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:26,964
Won't you exchange your cell phone

90
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:33,564
for the gun that I fired just a while ago?

91
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:34,764
Hey, what's going on?

92
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:37,464
Explain the circumstances! Answer me!

93
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:40,064
Long time no see, Bourbon.

94
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:45,264
No. Was it Mr. Amuro?

95
00:06:45,265 --> 00:06:47,964
Shuichi Akai...

96
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:50,864
As a token of my apology of having destroyed the cars of your comrades,

97
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:53,664
I gave them a little souvenir.

98
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:57,264
The gun that Rikumichi Kusuda used to kill himself.

99
00:06:57,265 --> 00:06:58,764
If you search where the gun came from,

100
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:00,764
you may come up with something.

101
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:02,264
This is Japan.

102
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:03,464
So as to things like this,

103
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:07,164
rather than the FBI you guys are more adept, no?

104
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:10,164
Don't tell me you know my identity?

105
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:13,164
I always had doubts about you from when we were at the Organization.

106
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:17,564
But letting it slip to that boy that your nickname is Zero was a mistake.

107
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:20,564
Rei Furuya.

108
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,664
The nickname Zero is not common.

109
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:25,764
So it was easy to do the search.

110
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:29,064
You probably meant to turn me over to them,

111
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:34,264
raise your prestige and get closer to the heart of the Organization.

112
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:36,065
But let me tell you this.

113
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:40,864
Don't get distracted by what's in front of you

114
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:43,464
and pursue the wrong prey.

115
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:47,964
I'd rather not make an enemy out of you.

116
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:50,064
And...

117
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:54,764
I still feel bad about what happened to him.

118
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,165
Okay, Camel start the car.

119
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:04,664
What shall we do, Mr. Furuya?

120
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:05,665
Shall we go after then?

121
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:06,665
No.

122
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,364
Now that they know who we are,

123
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:12,165
pursuing them any farther is dangerous.

124
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:19,865
I still feel bad about what happened to him.

125
00:08:21,265 --> 00:08:22,564
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:25,064
I seemed to have made a mistake.

127
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:26,264
I'm leaving.

128
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:27,365
Okay.

129
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:31,764
Before I go may I ask you one thing?

130
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:33,364
What is it?

131
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:38,165
Why did you let a suspicious person like me into your house?

132
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:44,364
You looked quite desperate wanting to talk, so I guess.

133
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:49,565
I did think you were quite a talkative deliveryman, though.

134
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:52,165
Is that so?

135
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:56,764
Who were they anyway?

136
00:08:56,765 --> 00:09:00,164
I can't make anything out at all.

137
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,364
Although they work for someone else,

138
00:09:02,365 --> 00:09:04,664
they're after the same thing.

139
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:08,165
They're wolves trying to get their teeth into those guys.

140
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:22,365
No bugs inside the house.

141
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:26,165
Hey. You can come out now!

142
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:33,964
I'm tired.

143
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:37,164
I mean, I wish you'd do as we planned.

144
00:09:37,165 --> 00:09:39,165
It worked out fine, didn't it?

145
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:44,764
Basically, I talk with the voice changer that is embedded in this mask.

146
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:46,764
And in case I'm told to remove my mask

147
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:49,364
or asked a question that's difficult to answer

148
00:09:49,365 --> 00:09:51,564
after clearing my throat twice,

149
00:09:51,565 --> 00:09:54,364
you talk through the speaker with the built in voice changer

150
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:56,964
and answer him.

151
00:09:56,965 --> 00:09:59,564
Then if I want to start talking,

152
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,064
I clear my voice once.

153
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:05,565
So that the difference in voice is unnoticeable.

154
00:10:08,465 --> 00:10:10,764
Great job, don't you think?

155
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:13,764
I'd like to be awarded best supporting actor!

156
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:15,464
Yes...

157
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:19,564
Well, the one I'd like to give this award the most is to her.

158
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:24,364
The person who is still doing a great job on the monitor.

159
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:28,564
Then, Mr. Kudo, any plans for your next piece?

160
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:31,164
Well... when the time comes.

161
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:34,464
I'm afraid that I'll sprain my ankle because of the secret boots

162
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:36,764
and my neck is ticklish thanks to the voice changer.

163
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:38,864
I can't take it anymore!

164
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:41,164
You'd better be grateful to Mom.

165
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:43,664
After she helped me disguise myself,

166
00:10:43,665 --> 00:10:47,164
she headed for the Macademy Awards by plane immediately

167
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:49,664
to take my place.

168
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:53,164
Yeah. She's really good at disguising members of her own family.

169
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:57,764
She was also pretty good when she help me disguise myself as Haibara.

170
00:10:57,765 --> 00:10:59,664
And?

171
00:10:59,665 --> 00:11:03,864
Is that FBI agent that I went out of my way to take the place of,

172
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:06,364
coming back here again?

173
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,964
Yeah.

174
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:12,565
Because there's somebody he need to protect.

175
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:20,871
My, how perfect.

176
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:23,071
You're very nicely disguised!

177
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:25,271
Thank you.

178
00:11:25,272 --> 00:11:29,071
Now I won't have to come every week to check on you anymore!

179
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:30,871
Thank you very much for everything.

180
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:34,371
Personally, it's sad that I won't have an excuse

181
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:36,371
to come visit you anymore though.

182
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:37,472
Hey.

183
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:40,371
Shu?

184
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:42,771
Are you really Mr. Akai?

185
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:45,971
Yeah. My voice is the same as before, isn't it?

186
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:49,071
But, aside from that, you're a totally different person.

187
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:54,471
But if I use this choker type voice changer around my neck...

188
00:11:54,472 --> 00:11:57,171
I become Subaru Okiya.

189
00:11:57,172 --> 00:11:59,371
His voice changed.

190
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:03,771
I owe this all to Dr. Agasa who made me this voice changer.

191
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:07,771
And the wife of the owner of this house,

192
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:10,071
Yukiko's splendid talent to disguise people.

193
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:16,371
Also to the boy who planned all this, Conan Edogawa.

194
00:12:16,372 --> 00:12:19,371
But what is their connection to you?

195
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,571
The thing is...

196
00:12:21,572 --> 00:12:23,571
They're distant relatives of mine!

197
00:12:23,572 --> 00:12:27,671
Mr. Akai said that he'd live in a modest apartment,

198
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:30,471
but that apartment happened to catch fire.

199
00:12:30,472 --> 00:12:34,671
So I told him how about living in Aunty Yukiko's house...

200
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:38,271
I mean, Ms. Kudo, where nobody lives now.

201
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:41,471
But what if their son Shinichi Kudo comes home

202
00:12:41,472 --> 00:12:43,871
and sees a stranger living in his house?

203
00:12:43,872 --> 00:12:45,571
Wouldn't he be surprised?

204
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:49,171
Well... I've told my son about it already.

205
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:51,471
Right, Shin...

206
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:53,171
Conan!

207
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,571
Yep!

208
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:56,471
By the way, Yukiko...

209
00:12:56,472 --> 00:12:58,171
Is it all right?

210
00:12:58,172 --> 00:13:00,771
It's about time for your plane ride back home.

211
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:04,371
What! It's already this late?

212
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:07,072
See you, Shin... Conan!

213
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:11,372
Shin Conan?

214
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:17,171
But, what a surprise.

215
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:20,571
I didn't think James also knew about this.

216
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:24,071
I didn't plan on telling him about it either but...

217
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:26,971
Was that Rena Mizunashi you were talking to on the phone?

218
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,271
Yes, sir.

219
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:31,671
She asked me if I could see her from now.

220
00:13:31,672 --> 00:13:34,971
Let's call Jodie

221
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:37,272
and tell her how we intend to cope with the situation.

222
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:43,272
What's wrong?

223
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:49,671
They noticed the coating on my fingertips, you see.

224
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:53,571
Then, why didn't you tell us too?

225
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:55,271
Didn't I tell you before?

226
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:58,171
In order to deceive the enemy, we've gotta start first with friends.

227
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:03,071
They tried to get information out of you too, didn't they?

228
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:05,071
If I had told you that I was alive,

229
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:07,471
they would've found out back then too.

230
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,971
Maybe but...

231
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:15,071
Well, we needed that guy to understand our situation.

232
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:19,371
So, although it was risky we decided to take the risk.

233
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:23,471
By that guy, do you mean Bourbon, Tohru Amuro?

234
00:14:23,472 --> 00:14:24,871
Yeah.

235
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:28,771
I assumed that he'd come alone to see me

236
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:31,271
but I didn't think that

237
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:35,271
he'd come with everybody else just like the boy said.

238
00:14:35,272 --> 00:14:41,571
The grudge he has against me is much deeper seated than I thought.

239
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:44,371
Does that grudge by chance...

240
00:14:44,372 --> 00:14:48,172
is what you mentioned to Bourbon over the phone?

241
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:54,471
You guys.

242
00:14:54,472 --> 00:14:55,771
Conan!

243
00:14:55,772 --> 00:14:58,171
How come you're here?

244
00:14:58,172 --> 00:15:00,371
Oh, well. I sort of...

245
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:02,571
Why are you guys here?

246
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:05,671
We came to have Subaru solve a riddle for us!

247
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:06,771
A riddle?

248
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,471
Conan, we shouldn't talk in the hallway.

249
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:11,771
Why don't you ask them to come inside?

250
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:13,171
I guess so.

251
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:14,371
All right!

252
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,672
Excuse the intrusion!

253
00:15:18,072 --> 00:15:20,171
Do you still have the curry that we ate the other day?

254
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:21,671
Yes, just a bit.

255
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,871
All right!

256
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:26,071
Did you do any cooking, Shu?

257
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:28,271
Yukiko taught me.

258
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:32,671
I can save on food expenses and it's a good diversion too.

259
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:34,271
Really?

260
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:40,771
First, Dr. Agasa brings warm black tea in four stainless mug cups.

261
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:47,471
Out of the four coasters, on three of them a black skull mark was drawn.

262
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:50,071
And the coasters were turned right side down,

263
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:52,371
then in the coaster which had no skull mark on it,

264
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:54,771
tea with lemon was filled.

265
00:15:54,772 --> 00:15:56,771
On the remaining three coasters,

266
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:58,971
we place the tea with vinegar in it on them!

267
00:15:58,972 --> 00:16:00,271
Vinegar?

268
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:04,171
Then, Dr. Agasa says, "I have psychic powers."

269
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:08,971
I shall pick out the tea without the vinegar, without even smelling it!

270
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:12,671
Then he picks up a cup and starts drinking from it like it tastes good!

271
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,971
And when we looked at the coaster that the cup was on,

272
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:19,571
there was no skull mark drawn on it!

273
00:16:19,572 --> 00:16:22,471
Of course you changed the position of cups, right?

274
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:26,771
Yes! We moved the coaster and all when Dr. Agasa had his back turned.

275
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:29,471
You really put vinegar in it?

276
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:31,771
Yep! Because when we drank the tea that was left...

277
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:34,671
It tasted really bad and I almost threw up.

278
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:37,971
Was that ball pen is the erasable kind?

279
00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:42,472
-Yes. -But, he didn't do anything after the mark was drawn.

280
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:48,271
Then shall we have the people that the United States take pride in,

281
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:50,471
solve that riddle?

282
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:51,972
-What? -What?

283
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:56,471
That's why I told you,

284
00:16:56,472 --> 00:16:58,671
that Akai would never be alive.

285
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:02,171
Yes. I was being overreacting.

286
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:04,871
No more of something like this, okay?

287
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:09,271
Yes. But if something comes up again, please help me out.

288
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:16,271
Because after all I'm among the few who know about your secret.

289
00:17:16,272 --> 00:17:19,771
I'm sure the Organization's members will be surprised if they find out.

290
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,671
That you're Boss'...

291
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:24,271
If you keep talking about it,

292
00:17:24,272 --> 00:17:27,471
I'll bust you brains out onto the windshield!

293
00:17:27,472 --> 00:17:29,271
I don't think you'd better,

294
00:17:29,272 --> 00:17:31,371
because cleaning up will be horrors.

295
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:32,771
No problem.

296
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:35,071
Besides, this isn't my car.

297
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:37,171
I'm not talking about my brains.

298
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:39,671
I said before, didn't I?

299
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:42,071
If my whereabouts ever become unknown,

300
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:44,071
arrangements have been made

301
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:47,371
so that your secret will be leaked throughout the Organization.

302
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:49,871
That's right.

303
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:51,471
Rest assured.

304
00:17:51,472 --> 00:17:55,071
Since your secret is tightly sealed.

305
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:57,071
No need to worry.

306
00:17:57,072 --> 00:17:58,771
No need to worry?

307
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:04,171
Didn't the FBI find you suspicious after you picked a fight with them?

308
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:05,971
No matter how much they suspect me,

309
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:09,171
without proof they can't lay a hand on me.

310
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,271
That's all within calculation.

311
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:16,071
The only thing I wasn't ready for back then was...

312
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:18,771
Amuro,

313
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:21,771
you're enemies, right?

314
00:18:21,772 --> 00:18:23,672
With the bad guys?

315
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,571
Well, from now on,

316
00:18:28,572 --> 00:18:31,871
it's better you avoid going off on your own.

317
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:37,371
Gin was making a big deal about spies sneaking into the Organization.

318
00:18:37,372 --> 00:18:41,271
The guy called Hondo, FBI agent called Akai

319
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:43,471
and that other guy make three.

320
00:18:43,472 --> 00:18:46,271
Remember. The one from the security police

321
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,771
who snuck in and was killed even before we got his name.

322
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:50,871
I think his code name was...

323
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:52,172
Scotch.

324
00:18:53,972 --> 00:18:56,271
I think it was.

325
00:18:56,272 --> 00:18:59,571
There's no Scotch.

326
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,371
You used to be a whiskey drinker

327
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:04,771
and liked Scotch as much as you liked Bourbon...

328
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:07,571
I've been drinking only Bourbon recently.

329
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:09,271
Talking of Bourbon,

330
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:13,671
I wonder if he really meant to hand you over to the Organization?

331
00:19:13,672 --> 00:19:17,171
If Shu tells them about how he was caught...

332
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:19,771
With you taken hostage,

333
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:22,671
he figured I wouldn't say a word.

334
00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:24,771
More than that, did you solve the riddle?

335
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:27,271
Dr. Agasa's psychic powers trick.

336
00:19:27,272 --> 00:19:28,671
Oh, no.

337
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:31,971
I've been thinking for a while now but...

338
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:35,371
I can't come up with what seems right.

339
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:38,772
The key to that riddle is the ball pen.

340
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,371
Ball pen?

341
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:44,471
Yeah. Dr. Agasa used the erasable ball pen

342
00:19:44,472 --> 00:19:46,671
to draw the skull, right?

343
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:50,671
The fact is it erases using heat from friction

344
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:52,871
when rubbing the rubber on the tail end of the ball pen.

345
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:57,971
In other words, that ball pen uses ink that is erased when heat is added!

346
00:19:57,972 --> 00:20:01,671
So, no matter which cup Dr. Agasa picks up,

347
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:03,771
the skull mark of all three cups would've disappeared

348
00:20:03,772 --> 00:20:06,671
from the temperature of the tea!

349
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:11,671
But all the three cups of tea that remained tasted strange.

350
00:20:11,672 --> 00:20:15,371
Vinegar was inside of all of the teacups to begin with!

351
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:18,571
He drank it making believe that the tea tasted good.

352
00:20:18,572 --> 00:20:20,271
-What was that about? -What was that about?

353
00:20:20,272 --> 00:20:22,871
But, that means...

354
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:24,371
He cheated?

355
00:20:24,372 --> 00:20:27,871
All tricks turn out that way once the secret's out.

356
00:20:27,872 --> 00:20:29,871
True, but...

357
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:31,871
And?

358
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:34,771
Why did you confirm time and again

359
00:20:34,772 --> 00:20:37,271
whether people were tailing us and called us here?

360
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:38,771
I don't think you wanted to show us how good you've become

361
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:41,371
in disguising yourself, did you?

362
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:42,472
No.

363
00:20:43,772 --> 00:20:47,871
This morning, I got mail from Kir, Rena Mizunashi.

364
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:48,872
What?

365
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:53,771
Then it seems that those guys still don't know that you're alive?

366
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:55,571
No, probably not.

367
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:57,271
I received text mail

368
00:20:57,272 --> 00:20:59,371
but it consisted only of three letters of the alphabet.

369
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:01,171
Three letters of the alphabet?

370
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:03,171
An abbreviation of something?

371
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:07,871
No. It's the name of a liquor that both of you know very well of.

372
00:21:07,872 --> 00:21:09,471
R. U. M.

373
00:21:09,472 --> 00:21:12,672
RUM. Their code name.

374
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,471
RUM?

375
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:19,871
When I was at the Organization, I heard that name a few times.

376
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:22,671
It seems to be the name of a close aide to the boss.

377
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:24,171
Aide?

378
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:26,971
But I got no such info.

379
00:21:26,972 --> 00:21:29,871
Judging from the looks of it,

380
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:33,371
because only the letters were sent over,

381
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:36,671
it may have been so urgent that she had no time to text you anything.

382
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:41,971
Go and tell James that the big shot's going to start making a move.

383
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:44,372
Somebody greater than Gin.

384
00:23:05,772 --> 00:23:09,271
"Mouri Detective Agency."

385
00:23:09,272 --> 00:23:13,772
"Cafe Poirot."

386
00:23:15,972 --> 00:23:17,172
Hello there.

387
00:23:28,872 --> 00:23:30,172
Liar.

388
00:23:32,272 --> 00:23:34,472
Look who's talking.

389
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:47,171
"Next Episode."

390
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:49,371
We can't be waiting for the police.

391
00:23:49,372 --> 00:23:52,171
I'll nab the perp and save this person.

392
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:54,871
"Today at sundown, TB will die!" -with initials, "TB"!

393
00:23:54,872 --> 00:23:57,972
Eimi, who's Romeo?

394
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:02,871
Scram, 'cos you get on my nerves.

395
00:24:02,872 --> 00:24:05,771
The person was the perp, after all!

396
00:24:05,772 --> 00:24:07,471
Wait, Sonoko!

397
00:24:07,472 --> 00:24:13,072
