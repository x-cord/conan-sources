1
00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:04,098
Pops Mouri and I encountered a comedian called Rokusuke Dodonpa,

2
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:06,298
who came to turn himself in,

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,398
at a police box in front of Beika Station.

4
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:11,298
He claimed to have killed Hideki Tendo,

5
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:14,298
the president of his talent agency.

6
00:00:16,898 --> 00:00:19,598
However, the police investigation

7
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:22,398
turned up inconsistencies with the murder weapon,

8
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:25,998
time of death, and contradictions in his testimony.

9
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:30,598
When a witness to his alibi named Izumi Suda was discovered,

10
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,398
it was eventually disclosed that he lied and turned himself in

11
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:36,398
because he wanted to be thought of as the killer who committed the crime.

12
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:40,498
With that, all charges against Mr. Rokusuke Dodonpa was dropped.

13
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:47,698
I'm sorry, everyone.

14
00:00:47,698 --> 00:00:50,298
I, Rokusuke Dodonpa, in order to save the reputation of Hideki Tendo,

15
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:53,598
of the one who I owe my life to

16
00:00:53,598 --> 00:00:56,698
wanted to take the place of the killer.

17
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:59,598
For this single reason, I lied and turned myself in.

18
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:02,498
I am really sorry.

19
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:09,698
How did you all find out that Mr. Dodonpa turned himself in?

20
00:01:11,298 --> 00:01:13,198
We were informed.

21
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,498
We each received an anonymous call at our company.

22
00:01:16,498 --> 00:01:18,698
Who'd leak out such information?

23
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:20,398
The ones who knew were...

24
00:01:20,398 --> 00:01:22,298
What?

25
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:25,898
It's unthinkable that police officer would leak the info.

26
00:01:25,898 --> 00:01:27,798
It's neither Pops nor me.

27
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:30,298
Maybe his real motive

28
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:34,398
wasn't becoming the killer of a case that he didn't even commit

29
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:37,098
but to make everyone think he did.

30
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:43,598
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

31
00:01:43,598 --> 00:01:45,598
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

32
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:47,398
A popular sitcom performer.

33
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,298
His alibi is shattered by unexpected sharpness.

34
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:50,798
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:52,698
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:55,198
His name is Detective Conan.

37
00:03:37,504 --> 00:03:42,804
"The Comedian Who Turned Himself In (Part 2)"

38
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:46,104
Pops, breakfast's ready.

39
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:49,104
Where's Ran?

40
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:53,004
She left early this morning because she had a karate match to go to.

41
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:56,104
Don't you have to go to school?

42
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:57,804
Today's a holiday.

43
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,704
Oh, I see.

44
00:03:59,704 --> 00:04:03,004
I'm sorry, everyone.

45
00:04:04,504 --> 00:04:08,904
In order to save the reputation of Hideki Tendo,

46
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:12,004
I wanted to take the place of the killer.

47
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:15,004
For this single reason, I lied and turned myself in.

48
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,204
I am really sorry.

49
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:21,404
A fluke resulting from misfortune, I guess.

50
00:04:21,404 --> 00:04:23,504
He's suddenly got the attention of everyone,

51
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:26,004
and became the "man of the times".

52
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:30,104
But why on earth did he go out of his way to turn himself in like that?

53
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:34,504
I thought till now that he was a nasty guy with a bad habit.

54
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:37,304
But, I guess he was in fact a very good person.

55
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:40,504
His likability will skyrocket.

56
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:42,604
He'll be offered job after job.

57
00:04:42,604 --> 00:04:45,404
He's going to make millions.

58
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:48,504
I'm telling you, it's true everybody!

59
00:04:48,504 --> 00:04:52,504
Dodonpa, Dodonpa never lies.

60
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:11,204
Officer Takagi.

61
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:13,204
Oh, Conan.

62
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:16,504
Pops asked me to check out the crime scene.

63
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:20,004
I think he's a bit bothered about this case after all.

64
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:24,504
Did the killer use this emergency stairs to go in and out?

65
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:29,404
Yes. The manager didn't see any suspicious people.

66
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:34,204
He was also bothered about the murder weapon, the steel pipe.

67
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:37,804
There was a construction site on the way here from Beika Station,

68
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,004
and it seems to have been brought from there.

69
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:42,404
Officer Takagi,

70
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:44,204
no matter who we ask,

71
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:46,404
everyone says that the victim Hideki Tendo had a good reputation

72
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:48,904
and is not someone who would extort anyone.

73
00:05:48,904 --> 00:05:51,604
But then...

74
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:56,304
Then it differs drastically from what Mr. Dodonpa's been saying.

75
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:01,204
Yes, Takagi here.

76
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:06,104
What? You got a call from the killer?

77
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:07,104
Yes.

78
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:11,504
Just now I got a call at The Metropolitan Police Department from the killer

79
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,804
saying that he had been blackmailed by Mr. Tendo.

80
00:06:13,804 --> 00:06:17,604
It's because that guy Tendo kept blackmailing me!

81
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:19,504
I couldn't take it anymore, that's why.

82
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,104
I understand how you feel.

83
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:24,904
But first, tell me your name.

84
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:29,004
Hello. Hello.

85
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:30,904
The call was from public phone booth

86
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:33,304
so the officers are headed over

87
00:06:33,304 --> 00:06:35,404
but from the way that she talked...

88
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:36,904
It was a woman.

89
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:38,404
I got it.

90
00:06:40,204 --> 00:06:42,204
The killer's female?

91
00:06:42,204 --> 00:06:44,304
It's a woman?

92
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,804
Mr. Dodonpa.

93
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:49,304
I wanted some clues on the killer.

94
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:53,504
Left as is, Mr. Tendo could never rest in peace.

95
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:56,104
But... I think it'll be fine.

96
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:59,904
Pops says he already has an idea of who the real killer is, you see.

97
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:03,804
He said that all he had left to do was to get a hold of evidence.

98
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:06,104
Really? Conan?

99
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:08,604
Can I believe you?

100
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:11,104
He is a famed detective, after all.

101
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:12,904
I guess so.

102
00:07:12,904 --> 00:07:15,704
The Sleeping Kogoro is famous so...

103
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:21,004
Mr. Dodonpa, you dropped this.

104
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:24,104
It's tissue from the pachinko parlor.

105
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:25,504
Thank you.

106
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:28,704
I'm convinced that the killer is a woman.

107
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:31,404
It was probably easy to blackmail her.

108
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:35,804
What? The Kogoro Mouri did?

109
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:37,904
He asked me to confirm.

110
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:40,504
Just as would be expected of a great detective.

111
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:43,304
Exactly, it was always like that.

112
00:07:43,304 --> 00:07:46,504
I asked him why too.

113
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:51,204
You always come shopping around this time.

114
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,904
At a little before 8 am.

115
00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:55,504
I got a habit of eating

116
00:07:55,504 --> 00:07:58,104
while watching the morning show that starts at 8 am, you see.

117
00:07:58,104 --> 00:08:00,804
The girl MC announcer is so cute.

118
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:02,504
Oh, I see.

119
00:08:02,504 --> 00:08:05,704
You watch the girl announcer while you eat, eh.

120
00:08:05,704 --> 00:08:08,204
I'd do the same for that girl announcer.

121
00:08:08,204 --> 00:08:10,104
Thank you, sir.

122
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:12,504
Just as I thought.

123
00:08:12,504 --> 00:08:15,704
His breakfast time was set.

124
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,004
What?

125
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:18,404
You?

126
00:08:18,404 --> 00:08:22,004
You're running an errand for Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

127
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:26,204
And? Who is Kogoro Mouri?

128
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:28,404
He's a famous great detective.

129
00:08:28,404 --> 00:08:31,604
Oh. I don't know him.

130
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:34,304
Tell him that if he wants to ask me something,

131
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:36,604
don't send a child over

132
00:08:36,604 --> 00:08:41,104
but come here himself!

133
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,504
I see.

134
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:44,904
She's a bit out of this world.

135
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:49,304
That's probably why she was used to scheme establishing the alibi too.

136
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:53,004
Mr. Mouri?

137
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:54,504
Megure here.

138
00:08:54,504 --> 00:08:58,204
Inspector, why are you asking me to do it?

139
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,304
I mean...

140
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:04,304
What meaning is there asking her at this point?

141
00:09:06,204 --> 00:09:09,104
Why are you here?

142
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:16,104
Then you're not too concerned about things like time, right, Ms. Suda?

143
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:18,504
I don't give a hoot at all.

144
00:09:18,504 --> 00:09:21,304
Once I confine myself to this atelier,

145
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:24,204
all I do is draw.

146
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:27,804
And, if I get sleepy I knock myself out to sleep over there!

147
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:30,404
That's my life.

148
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,804
And, about yesterday...

149
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:39,504
Since you don't have a TV, radio, or cell phone,

150
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:41,504
in order to tell time

151
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:44,604
all you have is that wall clock, right?

152
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:45,604
That's right.

153
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:48,604
That one clock is more than enough for me.

154
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:50,204
And...

155
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:53,504
Shut up, will you?

156
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:56,304
I'd like to ask you about yesterday.

157
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,704
It's like I told the cop.

158
00:10:00,204 --> 00:10:01,304
The night before last,

159
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:02,604
I got a call from Dodonpa saying that

160
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:05,804
he'd be coming here the next day at 9 am,

161
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:08,904
and like he said, he came here yesterday.

162
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:12,504
Did you confirm the time with that clock at that time?

163
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:16,104
I did. It was 9 sharp like he promised.

164
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:17,804
All right.

165
00:10:17,804 --> 00:10:20,304
That's all I need to confirm.

166
00:10:20,304 --> 00:10:21,604
Let's go.

167
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:22,804
Wait.

168
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:26,204
When the cops came yesterday...

169
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,304
Who's asking?

170
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:33,904
Are you still resting?

171
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:37,204
It seems that you were sleeping back then,

172
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,104
but do you always take an afternoon nap?

173
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:41,304
Yesterday was special.

174
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:43,504
I must've been really tired.

175
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:45,604
While I was eating the cake that Dodonpa brought over

176
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,304
and was chatting with him,

177
00:10:48,304 --> 00:10:50,804
I sort of got sleepy.

178
00:10:50,804 --> 00:10:52,204
I see.

179
00:10:52,204 --> 00:10:53,904
And...

180
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,504
I'm telling you, let's go, you brat!

181
00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:58,204
Just one more thing!

182
00:10:58,204 --> 00:11:02,604
Do you lock the door of this atelier before you go to bed at night?

183
00:11:02,604 --> 00:11:04,104
Not at all!

184
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:07,104
There's nothing in here to steal.

185
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:16,704
There's no room for doubt at all.

186
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:21,204
You. Why were you there?

187
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:22,204
What?

188
00:11:22,204 --> 00:11:24,604
That's because...

189
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:26,504
Something's strange.

190
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:28,704
What're you up to?

191
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:30,804
Thank you.

192
00:11:30,804 --> 00:11:32,904
"Paradise Hall"?

193
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:36,104
Hey, do the balls come out easily?

194
00:11:36,104 --> 00:11:37,704
Of course.

195
00:11:37,704 --> 00:11:42,004
So much that you want them to stop...

196
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:43,204
It's right ahead, right?

197
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:44,804
Here I come.

198
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,504
Thank you for your patronage.

199
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:48,104
Hey, sir.

200
00:11:49,304 --> 00:11:50,804
What is it, sonny?

201
00:11:50,804 --> 00:11:53,504
Were passing those tissues out yesterday too?

202
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,604
Yes.

203
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:58,304
I was passing them out yesterday from around just before 10 am.

204
00:11:58,304 --> 00:11:59,604
Didn't you give a pocket tissue

205
00:11:59,604 --> 00:12:03,204
to somebody that you've seen on TV back then too?

206
00:12:03,204 --> 00:12:04,304
What?

207
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,104
Officer!

208
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:13,804
I hear you've found the killer?

209
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:16,604
-Were you asked to come too? -Yes.

210
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:20,604
Just as I was about to go to work I got a call from Mr. Mouri.

211
00:12:20,604 --> 00:12:23,704
Darn it. I'm broke.

212
00:12:23,704 --> 00:12:25,304
That tissue guy!

213
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:28,504
"So much that I want them to stop." My foot!

214
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:30,704
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Mouri.

215
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:33,104
Oh, Inspector.

216
00:12:33,104 --> 00:12:35,104
I hear you've found the killer.

217
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:37,904
Aren't you the one who called us?

218
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:47,804
This is the much rumoured Sleeping Kogoro, I see.

219
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:50,804
So... I shall start by telling you

220
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:53,304
the truth about the murder case of

221
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:55,904
the president of the talent agency, Mr. Hideki Tendo!

222
00:13:01,193 --> 00:13:05,593
I know that the one he was blackmailing was probably a woman but...

223
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:08,193
Oh... You're talking about the call?

224
00:13:08,193 --> 00:13:11,293
That was just a diversionary tactic

225
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:14,193
to keep the eyes of the police off of the real killer.

226
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:19,393
The story about Mr. Tendo blackmailing people itself is a lie.

227
00:13:19,393 --> 00:13:21,593
Isn't that right, Mr. Dodonpa?

228
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:27,093
Because you're the one who killed Mr. Tendo.

229
00:13:27,093 --> 00:13:29,093
Me?

230
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:32,193
Above all, you turned yourself in,

231
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:33,693
saying that you committed the murder.

232
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:38,793
So, as to that, we've already cleared that, haven't we?

233
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:40,793
I'm sad.

234
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:44,193
That my feelings of wanting to protect Mr. Tendo's reputation

235
00:13:44,193 --> 00:13:47,893
despite having to turn myself in for a crime that I didn't even commit,

236
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,393
cannot be understood.

237
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:52,593
I don't think anybody will understand that sort of feeling.

238
00:13:52,593 --> 00:13:58,093
Because you, yourself, had no such feelings at all.

239
00:13:58,093 --> 00:14:02,193
If so, why would I turn myself in?

240
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:05,693
I have an alibi for yesterday at 9 am

241
00:14:05,693 --> 00:14:09,093
when the president was murdered.

242
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:10,193
Am I right?

243
00:14:10,193 --> 00:14:12,293
-Yes. -What? Yes.

244
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:15,193
That's why all charges were dropped.

245
00:14:15,193 --> 00:14:16,593
Exactly.

246
00:14:16,593 --> 00:14:19,293
A shrewd guy...

247
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:21,193
To think that you would use

248
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,993
the investigation of the police to your advantage!

249
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:28,793
Yesterday morning, you came secretly here to Beika City.

250
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:31,193
At about 8:30 am.

251
00:14:31,193 --> 00:14:33,593
You stole a steel pipe from the construction site

252
00:14:33,593 --> 00:14:35,593
where no one was around.

253
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:37,393
You put it into a golf case

254
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:42,193
and used the emergency stairs to come to this office around 9 am.

255
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:43,993
Good morning.

256
00:14:43,993 --> 00:14:45,793
Dodonpa's here.

257
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:48,693
Morning. You're early today.

258
00:14:48,693 --> 00:14:50,693
Where's your guitar?

259
00:14:50,693 --> 00:14:55,893
I guess you ate your breakfast around 8 am as usual too, didn't you?

260
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:58,793
Yes. What about it?

261
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:01,593
That's of great importance,

262
00:15:01,593 --> 00:15:06,693
when the estimated time of death is to be concluded after the autopsy.

263
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:09,393
Hey. What're you talking about?

264
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:16,093
After committing the crime,

265
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:19,093
you hid the murder weapon in back of the condominium,

266
00:15:19,093 --> 00:15:21,393
rushed back to Akebono City

267
00:15:21,393 --> 00:15:24,993
and visited Ms. Suda's atelier.

268
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:27,093
At 10 am.

269
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,693
At 10 am?

270
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:31,593
I... I visited her at 9 am!

271
00:15:31,593 --> 00:15:34,993
Yes. Ms. Suda also said he came at 9 am.

272
00:15:34,993 --> 00:15:38,293
She testified that there's no mistake because she looked at the clock.

273
00:15:38,293 --> 00:15:42,593
What if that clock was delayed an hour?

274
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:43,593
How about it?

275
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:44,993
Not possible.

276
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:47,993
We confirmed when we went to question her.

277
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:51,993
Yes. Mr. Dodonpa came at 9 am sharp.

278
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:57,093
That's because the clock that was delayed an hour

279
00:15:57,093 --> 00:15:59,093
was turned back to the correct time

280
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:01,293
before the police came to confirm.

281
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,693
No way.

282
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:04,993
Probably the night before last.

283
00:16:04,993 --> 00:16:06,993
After waiting for Ms. Suda to fall asleep,

284
00:16:06,993 --> 00:16:09,893
you snuck into her atelier.

285
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:12,593
Ms. Suda who doesn't give a hoot about time to begin with,

286
00:16:12,593 --> 00:16:16,593
wouldn't have noticed if the time was delayed an hour.

287
00:16:16,593 --> 00:16:19,993
Did I come at the wrong time?

288
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:22,093
What?

289
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:24,193
No, you're right on time.

290
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:26,493
Come on in, will you?

291
00:16:26,493 --> 00:16:31,193
You made Ms. Suda believe that you came to visit her at 9 am.

292
00:16:31,193 --> 00:16:33,393
Moreover, I'll bet you laced some sleeping drug

293
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:36,493
on the cake that you took to her as a gift.

294
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:41,193
What's the matter, Ms. Suda?

295
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:45,993
Sorry. I'm suddenly sort of sleepy.

296
00:16:45,993 --> 00:16:47,693
I'm sure you're tired.

297
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:49,493
Please rest.

298
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:52,093
I'll leave on my own.

299
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:56,093
You turned back the clock that you temporarily delayed to normal.

300
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:58,393
That's why when I went to confirm the time,

301
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,793
it was correct.

302
00:17:02,393 --> 00:17:05,893
I'll use this as a material for my comedy, Mr. Mouri.

303
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:08,893
The deduction show of a great detective full of lies.

304
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:11,593
I'm sure that this'll become popular.

305
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:15,193
Yesterday morning,

306
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:17,893
You got into trouble with somebody

307
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:20,493
near Ms. Suda's atelier, didn't you?

308
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:26,393
Paradise Hall.

309
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:28,993
Thank you.

310
00:17:28,993 --> 00:17:31,393
Paradise Hall.

311
00:17:31,393 --> 00:17:35,193
Oh, you're Mr. Rokusuke Dodonpa, aren't you?

312
00:17:35,193 --> 00:17:36,493
Wrong!

313
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:38,693
Please give me your autograph!

314
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:40,793
You've got the wrong person, I tell you!

315
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:45,893
It was a little before 10 am.

316
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:49,293
You had the drawing collection with you back then

317
00:17:49,293 --> 00:17:51,893
so you returned it after this incident.

318
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:55,393
It wasn't me, who got into trouble.

319
00:17:55,393 --> 00:17:59,193
I'm sure there are a lot of other people who have drawing collections.

320
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:00,693
I wonder?

321
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:02,393
Everything will be clear

322
00:18:02,393 --> 00:18:04,393
once we check the prints on the drawing collection, you know.

323
00:18:05,993 --> 00:18:07,193
It's only natural that my print would be on it

324
00:18:07,193 --> 00:18:10,393
because I borrowed it from her, right?

325
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:12,893
Not yours.

326
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:15,793
The prints of the guy who was passing out the tissues!

327
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:20,993
I'm telling you it wasn't me!

328
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:26,593
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:27,993
Sure.

330
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:31,493
You sure look like him.

331
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:34,793
Oh, no. It's almost 10 am.

332
00:18:38,693 --> 00:18:40,393
His prints wouldn't be on the drawing collection,

333
00:18:40,393 --> 00:18:43,093
unless it was when he got into an argument with you

334
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:46,893
and picked them up from the street, Mr. Dodonpa.

335
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:50,493
You visited Ms. Suda after the argument.

336
00:18:50,493 --> 00:18:53,193
Not at 9 am but actually at 10 am.

337
00:18:53,193 --> 00:18:55,693
It also very unnatural that Ms. Suda would get sleepy

338
00:18:55,693 --> 00:18:59,193
right after she ate the cake that you brought to her as a gift.

339
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:04,293
After making up a fake alibi,

340
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:08,193
you headed off for the Beika City again.

341
00:19:08,193 --> 00:19:11,493
You left Beika Station at 11 am.

342
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:15,193
You set the metal bat up as a fake murder weapon,

343
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:18,793
and turned yourself in at the police box at 11:30 am.

344
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:21,493
In addition to turning yourself in saying that you committed the murder,

345
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,693
you waited for the real murder weapon

346
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:27,393
and alibi witness to be found.

347
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:31,793
You waited for the investigation of the police to turn things over.

348
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:33,893
You tried to make us think that you were the killer at first

349
00:19:33,893 --> 00:19:37,293
and schemed for us turn that over for you.

350
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:40,893
But, why did you go out of your way to do something like that?

351
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:44,693
You wanted to catch two birds with one stone.

352
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:45,793
The press told us

353
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:49,493
that they found out that you killed President Tendo

354
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:53,093
and turned yourself in through an anonymous informant.

355
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:57,593
But, the only one who could've leaked such information at that point...

356
00:19:57,593 --> 00:19:59,093
is you, Mr. Dodonpa!

357
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:01,093
You're the only person who could've done it.

358
00:20:02,193 --> 00:20:05,293
Right. When you're on the way to turning yourself in...

359
00:20:05,293 --> 00:20:10,793
Yes, it seems that the comedian Mr. Rokusuke Dodonpa turned himself in!

360
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:15,993
You explained earnestly to the press that gathered there.

361
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:20,093
In order to save the reputation of Hideki Tendo,

362
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,493
I wanted to take the place of the killer.

363
00:20:23,493 --> 00:20:26,593
You made people think that you were a nice person,

364
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,493
and in order to gain attention,

365
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:33,793
you deliberately schemed an unthinkable trick of turning yourself in.

366
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:39,993
Bull's eye!

367
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:42,193
Right to the point!

368
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:44,693
That president was too old fashioned.

369
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:46,693
He used to say performers should only take jobs

370
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:49,293
where they can display their talents.

371
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:50,993
We, the performers want to make loads of cash

372
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:53,693
no matter what we have to do, you see?

373
00:20:53,693 --> 00:20:56,993
He got in my way, so I got rid of him.

374
00:20:56,993 --> 00:20:59,993
Like you said, I wanted to kill two birds with one stone!

375
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:02,493
It worked out just as I planned!

376
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:04,693
I got job offers after job offers!

377
00:21:04,693 --> 00:21:07,193
After all, my likability has skyrocketed

378
00:21:07,193 --> 00:21:09,193
and I am now the man of the times, you see.

379
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:16,893
I'm telling you, it's true everybody!

380
00:21:16,893 --> 00:21:20,893
Dodonpa, Dodonpa never lies.

381
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:23,993
Cut it out!

382
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:30,393
Why you!

383
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:34,193
How dare you so thoughtlessly take someone's life?

384
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:40,793
Yes, sir.

385
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:44,793
I told you that I was the real killer.

386
00:21:44,793 --> 00:21:46,793
I'm sorry.

387
00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:23,293
What's with that "Dodonpa never lies" bit?

388
00:23:23,293 --> 00:23:25,793
Yes, I never lie..

389
00:23:25,793 --> 00:23:29,793
Balls keep coming out so much that you want them to stop.

390
00:23:32,093 --> 00:23:33,793
You're full of lies!

391
00:23:33,793 --> 00:23:35,093
Out! Out!

392
00:23:35,093 --> 00:23:38,793
Out with the balls!

393
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,593
It doesn't look good for a famed detective

394
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:43,193
to fall for such a cheap lie.

395
00:23:44,993 --> 00:23:47,393
Keigo Hiura!

396
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:51,293
I'm a so-called writer of romantic novels.

397
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:54,393
Ma'am, are you all right? Ma'am?

398
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:57,193
The clear echoing of this voice.

399
00:23:58,593 --> 00:24:00,393
Ms. Minazuki!

400
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:10,793
Next Conan,

401
00:24:10,793 --> 00:24:14,893
"The Romance Novel with the Unexpected Conclusion (Part 1)"
