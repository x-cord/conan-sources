"Hatobue Lodge"

2
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:05,110
We came to the Hatobue Lodge guest house in Nishiokuho.

3
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:08,410
Popular entertainer Otaro Minakitaya,

4
00:00:08,411 --> 00:00:11,111
also known as the Prince of Beer, was staying there as well.

5
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:14,010
For some reason,

6
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:17,110
Miona, daughter of guest house manager, Asako Yuri,

7
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:21,110
was afraid of the Masked Comet Byun TV show

8
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:24,311
that aired seven years ago.

9
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:29,510
Meanwhile, a man's body was discovered in a lake

10
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:32,110
seven kilometers east of the guest house.

11
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:37,911
The body was Otaro's former partner, Kyujiro Minakitaya.

12
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:44,311
And that night, Otaro was found dead as well.

13
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:50,910
When the countdown reaches zero,

14
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:53,011
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

15
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:57,210
Both members of the former comedy duo are dead.

16
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:59,510
What did the Masked Comet do?

17
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:00,910
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:02,810
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:04,911
His name is Detective Conan.

20
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:48,781
"Eyewitness Testimony Seven Years Later (Part 2)"

21
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:53,380
The deceased is Otaro Minakitaya,

22
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,281
born Kotaro Minamida.

23
00:02:57,281 --> 00:03:00,380
Who was the last one to see Otaro?

24
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,180
"Makoto Muramatsu (48)" -Probably me.

25
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,880
"Shinsuke Ohara (29)" -Otaro came to the dining room

26
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:06,580
as I was cleaning up before I headed home.

27
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:09,280
He took beers and a bottle opener from the room.

28
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:12,480
Around what time was that?

29
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:14,280
It was about 11.

30
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:16,780
Did anyone enter the dining room after that?

31
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,780
I couldn't sleep,

32
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,980
so I went down to the dining room for a beer.

33
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:23,480
That was around midnight.

34
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:25,780
How long were you here?

35
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:28,780
I spent about 30 minutes

36
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:30,480
attaching beer caps to a cow magnet.

37
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:32,180
Then I went back to my room to sleep.

38
00:03:32,181 --> 00:03:37,880
And Fujiyoshi discovered the dining room in disarray around two.

39
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:41,180
It must have happened during that hour.

40
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:44,680
Otaro must have died around the same time.

41
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:45,780
Yes.

42
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:47,880
Shirogane, what about you?

43
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:50,480
I was sleeping in my room.

44
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,880
How about you?

45
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:56,280
I was sleeping in my room in the annex next door with my daughter.

46
00:03:56,281 --> 00:03:58,780
I woke up when Ran called me.

47
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:03,280
I was at home and returned when I received a phone call.

48
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:05,680
It was an accident.

49
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:08,680
He got drunk and fell when he stepped on an empty bottle.

50
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,881
His head struck an empty bottle, and he died.

51
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:15,580
It's unfortunate that both members of the former comedy duo

52
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:18,980
suffered accidental deaths one after another.

53
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:21,880
The situation has changed.

54
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:23,280
What?

55
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:26,980
The water found in Kyujiro's lungs

56
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,280
was ordinary tap water.

57
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:31,280
What?

58
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:34,580
In other words, he was dumped in the lake

59
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:36,380
after being killed elsewhere?

60
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:37,580
Yes.

61
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:38,880
Hold on.

62
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:43,180
Does that mean Otaro could've killed him?

63
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:47,980
Kyujiro was investigating Otaro, wasn't he?

64
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:52,080
We found this listening device in Otaro's room

65
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:54,580
with Kyujiro's fingerprints on it.

66
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:58,280
Maybe he discovered a major secret using that bug

67
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,680
and was killed to keep him quiet.

68
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:03,280
What major secret would that be?

69
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:05,380
Muramatsu, it's an emergency.

70
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:06,481
What is it?

71
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:09,381
What's going on?

72
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:16,480
We've determined the bloody fingerprint on the table belonged to Otaro,

73
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,280
but that fingerprint...

74
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:19,880
What is it?

75
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:21,580
In the case seven years ago,

76
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:24,080
the culprits threw the masks they were wearing

77
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:27,080
into a ditch and fled.

78
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:30,980
There was a single fingerprint they failed to wipe clean.

79
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:32,680
The culprit's fingerprint?

80
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:33,780
Could it be...

81
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:36,980
It matched Otaro's fingerprints.

82
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:38,381
Seriously?

83
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:44,480
In other words, Otaro was one of the two culprits.

84
00:05:44,481 --> 00:05:46,980
And Kyujiro was killed by Otaro

85
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,580
because he learned his secret.

86
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:50,680
Which means

87
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:55,380
we can't simply assume Otaro's death was an accident.

88
00:05:55,381 --> 00:06:01,681
Was the witness in the seven year old case is Miona?

89
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:11,080
The witness in the seven year old case was indeed Miona,

90
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:13,380
who was five years old at the time.

91
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:14,780
What?

92
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:17,380
I was assigned to the Haido City station at the time.

93
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:20,180
I was involved in the investigation.

94
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:23,680
Did Miona see the culprits' faces?

95
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:25,980
It's not clear if she did.

96
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:28,080
It must have been traumatizing for her.

97
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:30,680
Her memory is hazy.

98
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,980
Then the reason Otaro frequented this guest house

99
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,880
where Miona lived...

100
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:39,380
He was watching to see if she'd regain her memory.

101
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:40,680
What?

102
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:41,781
Boss!

103
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:46,280
Thank you.

104
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,080
That's why Miona was afraid of

105
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:51,680
discussions about the Masked Comet.

106
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:57,280
That case was the reason Masked Comet Byun was canceled.

107
00:06:57,281 --> 00:07:00,280
The case did have an impact,

108
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:02,780
but ratings and merchandise sales

109
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:04,480
were failing to meet expectations.

110
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:08,080
They were considering ending the show early.

111
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:10,480
That case wasn't the only reason.

112
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:12,880
How do you know so much about it?

113
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:17,080
I'm actually a scriptwriter, not a freelance writer.

114
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:21,080
I was the head writer for Masked Comet Byun.

115
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:22,081
What?

116
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:26,180
-Really? -Did you know about Miona?

117
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:29,181
You had a newspaper clipping about the case.

118
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:36,580
Naturally, Miona's identity was kept anonymous as the time,

119
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,581
but some heartless people publicly revealed her name online.

120
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:44,680
When I visited this town a year ago to cover a story,

121
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,980
I saw Miona.

122
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:49,880
I was worried about her and the damage she suffered.

123
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:51,780
I decided to visit the guest house

124
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:54,080
since I wasn't busy with work.

125
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:56,280
Didn't you know, too, Ide?

126
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:59,281
What? Well...

127
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:02,180
Yeah, I knew.

128
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,680
I investigated everything I could about the case.

129
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:06,380
Why would you do that?

130
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:08,280
Because...

131
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:11,980
the financial company employee who was murdered

132
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:13,880
was my father.

133
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:15,680
What?

134
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:19,180
Ide is my mother's maiden name.

135
00:08:19,181 --> 00:08:20,980
At the time of the case,

136
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:26,080
I was too busy caring for my traumatized mother to worry about it.

137
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:28,380
But when my mother passed away two years ago,

138
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:30,680
I suddenly became interested in the case.

139
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:33,680
I learned about Miona while doing my research.

140
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:37,280
So you even got a mask.

141
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:39,780
I thought she might remember something.

142
00:08:39,781 --> 00:08:43,680
I didn't think it would be so traumatizing for her.

143
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:46,281
I'm really sorry!

144
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:54,580
Come to think of it, there was a key on the table at the crime scene.

145
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:57,180
Does anyone know what it was for?

146
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:59,480
I was wondering about that, too.

147
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:01,280
When I saw it before,

148
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:05,080
he said it was a key to the door to happiness.

149
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:07,980
The door to happiness?

150
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,981
What does that mean?

151
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:15,781
I seem to be hungry.

152
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:19,981
The sun's rising.

153
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:25,481
I'll make something light.

154
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm sorry for making you worry.

155
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,680
She seems to have calmed down.

156
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:34,180
That's great.

157
00:09:34,181 --> 00:09:36,680
I asked Miona yesterday,

158
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:39,580
but you used to live in Haido City, right?

159
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:41,480
When did you move here?

160
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:44,980
We moved to Nishiokuho after the incident.

161
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:47,080
I thought living in a quiet place

162
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:50,380
would help heal her psychological wounds.

163
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,380
When did you start working at this guest house?

164
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:55,280
Right after we moved.

165
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:58,481
I used to work as a hotel receptionist.

166
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:01,481
Excuse me.

167
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:04,380
There you are.

168
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:05,880
I made sandwiches.

169
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:07,280
Let's eat in the other room.

170
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:08,981
Thank you.

171
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:12,780
Ohara, are you originally from this town?

172
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:16,380
No. I moved here about four years ago.

173
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:18,080
After graduating from culinary school,

174
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:19,680
I saw a want ad for this place.

175
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:21,480
Really?

176
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:26,581
Kyujiro's hair was found in Otaro's car.

177
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:32,180
We can leave now, can't we?

178
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:33,880
Hold on.

179
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:36,180
Otaro's death was an accident, right?

180
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:37,580
In that case...

181
00:10:37,581 --> 00:10:41,080
No, we can't assume it was yet.

182
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:43,580
Are you saying it was murder?

183
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:46,181
There's no one here who would...

184
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:49,381
It was you, wasn't it?

185
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:52,880
What... what are you talking about?

186
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:55,080
Didn't he kill your father?

187
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:57,680
I just learned that!

188
00:10:57,681 --> 00:11:00,380
Maybe Kyujiro told you.

189
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:03,180
Yeah. Maybe you killed Kyujiro, too.

190
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:05,280
That's insane.

191
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:07,780
When Kyujiro was killed,

192
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:11,080
I was on the same train as Mouri's family.

193
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:14,080
Mouri, are you certain of that?

194
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:17,680
Now that you mention it, I didn't see him on the train.

195
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:20,580
He spoke to us after we got off.

196
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:22,880
How can you be so heartless?

197
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:24,680
See?

198
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:25,980
The mark drawn in blood

199
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:27,980
was the same as the one on your shirt, right?

200
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:29,080
What?

201
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:31,280
Fujiyoshi, calm down.

202
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:35,080
Wasn't your show canceled because of the case?

203
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:36,680
Are you sure you didn't resent him?

204
00:11:36,681 --> 00:11:38,680
You really shouldn't say that.

205
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:42,681
If you're such a great detective, solve the case!

206
00:11:44,681 --> 00:11:48,681
Yeah, but the crime scene was locked.

207
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:57,280
The door was definitely locked and bolted.

208
00:11:57,281 --> 00:12:00,881
On top of that, the window was locked, too.

209
00:12:03,381 --> 00:12:04,880
Huh?

210
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:08,181
Seven empty bottles, six bottle caps.

211
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:11,380
There's one missing.

212
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:12,881
Where is it?

213
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:17,680
Huh?

214
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:20,080
They're shaped differently.

215
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:23,381
And what's this key for?

216
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:28,681
What's this key doing here?

217
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:31,881
It's that blue beer.

218
00:12:32,581 --> 00:12:35,480
I was completely deceived by its appearance.

219
00:12:35,481 --> 00:12:38,580
The key to the door to happiness...

220
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:40,081
So that's what that means!

221
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:42,480
Hold on.

222
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:43,881
Then that means...

223
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:46,980
Could it be...

224
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:49,080
I knew it.

225
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:50,580
That must be it.

226
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:53,781
The size of the thumbturn, the position of the bolt...

227
00:12:54,681 --> 00:12:57,981
I'm starting to see the truth behind this case.

228
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,459
Mouri, what is the meaning of this?

229
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,859
Everyone.

230
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,460
I will now reveal the truth behind the case.

231
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,460
Really?

232
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:15,359
Way to go, Detective!

233
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,559
First, Otaro did not kill Kyujiro.

234
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,659
-What? -But his hair was found in his car.

235
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,159
Otaro drove a convertible.

236
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,059
Could you transport a body in that?

237
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,159
He even owns a sedan.

238
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,459
You're right.

239
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,659
The hair was a camouflage planted by the culprit

240
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,859
to frame Otaro.

241
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,159
However, driving the convertible he recently purchased

242
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,459
was a miscalculation.

243
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,259
Then that person killed Otaro as well?

244
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,759
I know who did it, of course,

245
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,960
and how they created the locked room.

246
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,059
But the window was locked,

247
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,059
and the door was locked and deadbolted.

248
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,959
How did they do it?

249
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,259
Very well. Allow me to demonstrate.

250
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,659
Conan!

251
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,059
Here!

252
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,459
I'll take this bottle opener

253
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,359
and place it here.

254
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,959
And use this magnet...

255
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,659
The cow magnet.

256
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,360
To fix it in place.

257
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,159
If you close the door

258
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,360
and use the magnet to move the bottle opener...

259
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,159
You can lock the door and deadbolt at the same time.

260
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Then if you remove the magnet and shake the door a little...

261
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,959
I see.

262
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,759
If there are empty beer bottles on the floor,

263
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,359
then it's not unnatural for a bottle opener to be on the floor, too.

264
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,759
-I knew you did it. -What?

265
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,559
You said you were drinking

266
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,759
while playing with a cow magnet yesterday.

267
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,859
I told you, it wasn't me!

268
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,759
Otaro left us a message telling us who killed him.

269
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
What?

270
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,259
I knew it.

271
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,759
No, that's not Byun's symbol.

272
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,059
It's backwards.

273
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,060
Backwards?

274
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:06,859
Since the Masked Comet was so involved in this case,

275
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,959
it looked like his symbol to us.

276
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,559
But if you look at the position of his hand,

277
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,759
it's clear that it's reversed.

278
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,059
In other words, it's two lines sticking out of a circle?

279
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,559
What symbol is that?

280
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,259
In his signature,

281
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,159
Otaro expresses the "oh" sound as a circle.

282
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,059
In other words, the circle is "oh".

283
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,859
The two lines are the Katakana symbol for "ha".

284
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,859
They simply overlapped.

285
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,960
Then the name Otaro wrote was...

286
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,859
Ohara, you killed him.

287
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,359
This is ridiculous.

288
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,459
Why would I do that?

289
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,260
Because you were the other culprit in the seven-year-old case.

290
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,759
Kyujiro overheard you discussing your secret

291
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,559
using the bug he installed in your room and threatened you.

292
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,659
That's it!

293
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:05,459
He had the Byun card to tell you he knew everything.

294
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,359
First, you killed Kyujiro to keep him quiet.

295
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,660
You must have prepared some tap water beforehand.

296
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,559
You most likely drowned him in the van,

297
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,059
and dumped the body in the lake on your way to pick us up.

298
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,059
Then you killed Otaro

299
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,960
in order to frame him for the murder.

300
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,159
You're lying! You're making it up!

301
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,459
Then why did you lie about Otaro taking beers

302
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,859
and a bottle opener to his room?

303
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,759
I wasn't lying. I really saw him.

304
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,659
It's not unusual to take a bottle opener to drink beer.

305
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,959
Otaro didn't need to

306
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,859
because he had his own bottle opener.

307
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,659
We didn't find one.

308
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,159
You've been fooled by its appearance,

309
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,359
just like that blue beer.

310
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,259
The key to the door to happiness that Otaro described

311
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,059
is a bottle opener.

312
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,459
That key?

313
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,659
I get it. For a beer-lover like Otaro,

314
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,159
opening a beer

315
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,159
would be the same as opening the door to happiness.

316
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,259
The upturned edges of caps on the floor are slightly pointed.

317
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,059
It's a product of the shape of the bottle opener.

318
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,159
In order to make this a locked room,

319
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,459
you needed a bottle opener.

320
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,459
You expected to find one, but didn't.

321
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,459
You hurried back to the kitchen to get one.

322
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,459
You lied to hide this fact.

323
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,859
Why was the dining room ransacked?

324
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:44,259
In the dining room was the cow magnet you played with

325
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,459
that had many bottle caps stuck to it.

326
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,859
He had to remove them

327
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,959
in order to use the cow magnet in his trick.

328
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,560
However, it would be impossible to put them back.

329
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,759
So he scattered the caps on the floor

330
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,759
and ransacked the room to camouflage it.

331
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,959
What about proof? Do you have proof?

332
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,560
You know better than anyone that there's incriminating evidence

333
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,560
underneath your watch.

334
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,559
Normally you keep your watch in your pocket,

335
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,659
but since last night, you've been wearing it on your wrist.

336
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,059
So, what?

337
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,259
That watch is broken, isn't it?

338
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,259
When you checked the time earlier,

339
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,959
you looked at the wall clock after looking at your watch.

340
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,859
Well, I...

341
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,859
Last night, after murdering Otaro,

342
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,759
you intended to return the cow magnet

343
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,759
to the dining room before going home.

344
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,059
However, Fujiyoshi discovered the situation in the dining room first,

345
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,959
causing a commotion.

346
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,959
Unable to return to the dining room,

347
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,059
you climbed down the tree

348
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,659
next to the second floor guest room and escaped.

349
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,159
The cow magnet was in your pocket during this time.

350
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,859
The pocket that also contained your watch.

351
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,759
So the magnetic force of the cow magnet broke his watch.

352
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,159
When he returned after receiving a call,

353
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,959
he waited for an opportunity to drop it on the dining room floor.

354
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,760
Could you take off your watch?

355
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,859
This mark was left by a bottle cap.

356
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,959
Otaro must have resisted when you tried to kill him.

357
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,059
He pushed you to the ground,

358
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,359
pressing one of the bottle caps on the floor against your arm.

359
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,060
That's when you got that mark.

360
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,559
If we examine the bottle caps in the room,

361
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,059
we'll find skin or blood stuck to one.

362
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,759
Go ahead and examine them!

363
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,259
You won't find anything.

364
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,959
I'm sure we won't.

365
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,759
You took the cap with you.

366
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,959
However, you didn't have time to dispose of it very far away.

367
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,059
Furthermore, even if skin or blood aren't found on it,

368
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,760
the various caps are bent differently.

369
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,360
If one matches this mark, it'll prove you did it.

370
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,159
Otaro's the one who said we had to get rid of Kyujiro!

371
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,959
Then why did you kill Otaro?

372
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,559
He insisted on killing Miona!

373
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,059
So I had to kill him to protect her!

374
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,959
Is that true?

375
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,059
This locked room trick is simple,

376
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,359
but you couldn't have thought of it on the spot.

377
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,359
Are you sure you hadn't been plotting

378
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,959
to kill Otaro?

379
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,559
No!

380
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:44,159
You had always planned to murder Otaro and frame him.

381
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,159
No...

382
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,259
Otaro wanted to kill her seven years ago,

383
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,859
but I stopped him!

384
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,959
I protected her!

385
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
It was really scary.

386
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,560
Miona.

387
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,459
The bloody mask came closer,

388
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,860
and...

389
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,159
I protected you.

390
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,360
Right? Isn't that right?

391
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,959
Forget everything you saw here.

392
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,159
Got it?

393
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,260
Otherwise, we'll kill you, too.

394
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,359
No!

395
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,459
Miona!

396
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,159
The man I saw seven years ago...

397
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,760
was this man!

398
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,159
It was an awful case,

399
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,559
but at least that girl will be able to truly smile again.

400
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,060
Yeah.

401
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,460
Huh? Where'd everyone go?

402
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,360
In your case, you're not just feeling groggy from the beer.

403
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,659

-Akagi! -Hide!

405
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,159
Have you recovered from your injury?

406
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,759
I hope this makes you feel better.

407
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,359
I'll be rooting for you!

408
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,360
Thanks.

409
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,959
Eventually, the Japanese will understand

410
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,160
what gambling is all about.

411
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,860
Why?
