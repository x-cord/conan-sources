1
00:00:03,484 --> 00:00:04,983
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:04,984 --> 00:00:06,683
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:06,684 --> 00:00:08,583
Ran's suspicion has finally come to the truth.

4
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:10,183
The password brings her even closer to the truth.

5
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:11,883
It's a one-on-one battle between love and deduction.

6
00:00:11,884 --> 00:00:13,483
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:14,983
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:17,184
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:06,997
I'm done.

10
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:08,597
It was delicious.

11
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:11,997
Then off to bed you go. It's already after midnight.

12
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:12,998
Yes, sir.

13
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:15,498
Wait.

14
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:19,397
What is it, Ran?

15
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:23,397
Well, you know...

16
00:02:23,398 --> 00:02:26,097
Brush your teeth and go to sleep now.

17
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:28,398
Yes, I know.

18
00:02:30,198 --> 00:02:31,297
What's with him?

19
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:33,398
He seems oddly jittery.

20
00:02:35,498 --> 00:02:37,597
I guess he sort of realize it after all.

21
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,198
That I'm suspicious of his true identity.

22
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:43,598
Shinichi.

23
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,697
Oh, no.

24
00:02:46,698 --> 00:02:49,197
I may have forgotten to lock the door of the office.

25
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:52,297
Make sure you lock it before going to bed then.

26
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,598
Boy, I am sleepy.

27
00:02:59,698 --> 00:03:02,298
There's only one way for me to check...

28
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:15,498
whether what I suspect is true or not.

29
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:28,098
"Suspicious Ran"

30
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:37,397
I've got to go return the car.

31
00:03:37,398 --> 00:03:38,398
Okay.

32
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,197
Conan's cell phone.

33
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:58,297
If the mail that I sent is inside,

34
00:03:58,298 --> 00:04:01,298
it'll serve as a definite evidence that Conan is Shinichi.

35
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:05,097
Just as I thought.

36
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:06,897
The cell phone is switched off

37
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:08,697
so that the sound of my mail sent out to him won't ring.

38
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:10,697
But you've no choice already, Shinichi.

39
00:04:10,698 --> 00:04:13,697
Once the cell phone's switched on, everything will become clear.

40
00:04:13,698 --> 00:04:17,497
Wait. Is this what you really want?

41
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:20,597
What if Conan is really Shinichi?

42
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:23,497
How are you going to face up to him?

43
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:25,398
This boy...

44
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:28,297
is cute.

45
00:04:28,298 --> 00:04:30,697
My heart...

46
00:04:30,698 --> 00:04:34,197
He is a deduction freak who has always been mean since his childhood days

47
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:35,697
and always full of confidence.

48
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:38,897
But he has always been there in time of need.

49
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:40,697
He's so cool.

50
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,898
I like Shinichi more than anyone else.

51
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:49,197
I can't sleep.

52
00:04:49,198 --> 00:04:53,198
It was sure a lot of fun washing each other's back, wasn't it?

53
00:04:54,198 --> 00:04:57,997
Your nose is bleeding? Maybe the water was too hot?

54
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:02,497
Maybe I should just wait until he decides to tell me.

55
00:05:02,498 --> 00:05:04,897
He must have a reason.

56
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:08,097
And besides, it's not nice peeking into other people's cell phone.

57
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:13,597
But all I'm going to do is check whether the mail I sent is inside or not.

58
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:16,397
If that's all I'm going to do, it's okay, isn't it?

59
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:17,998
Sorry, Shinichi.

60
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:23,697
I see.

61
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,997
Just as I expected.

62
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:30,698
But most of the times, the password would be his birthday or something.

63
00:05:34,298 --> 00:05:37,197
I guess it's not all that simple.

64
00:05:37,198 --> 00:05:39,197
Now what?

65
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:41,997
There are 10,000 possible matches for 4 digit numbers,

66
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:45,097
and it would take at least 8 hours to try them all out.

67
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:47,198
What other possibility could there be?

68
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,698
Maybe my birthday?

69
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:57,398
How silly. Of course not.

70
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:04,097
Impossible.

71
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,797
That's impossible.

72
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,298
But I guess there's no harm trying, right?

73
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:12,198
Mine is...

74
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:15,897
But what shall I do?

75
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:19,898
If it is, what should I do?

76
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:28,298
I see. It's not after all.

77
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:32,498
What number is it?

78
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:37,898
Tell me what it is.

79
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:44,198
No, Ran. Cool down your head.

80
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:48,197
It seems they both went to sleep.

81
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:50,497
Nobody will bother me here.

82
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:52,397
And a slight sound won't be heard.

83
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:54,698
I've got all the time in the world, too.

84
00:07:01,698 --> 00:07:05,497
2036, 2037.

85
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:08,597
2038, 2039.

86
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:11,497
2040, 2041.

87
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,598
2042.

88
00:07:15,398 --> 00:07:16,897
No good.

89
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:20,397
At this rate, it's going to take me till morning.

90
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,797
I guess I'll just have to try to figure out

91
00:07:21,798 --> 00:07:24,097
the numbers that Shinichi is most likely to use.

92
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:25,697
Let's see...

93
00:07:25,698 --> 00:07:29,397
He likes Holmes.

94
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:33,298
Maybe the number is the year in which Holmes handled a case?

95
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:35,897
No, that can't be it.

96
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:39,698
Because I checked all the numbers from 1 to over 2,000 just a while ago.

97
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:54,398
Gosh. That noise!

98
00:07:58,498 --> 00:08:00,297
Hello it says (46-49, yoroshiku).

99
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:02,798
What a jerk. Being noisy at this time of night.

100
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:07,798
Come to think of it a while back...

101
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:16,897
Love romance movies are great after all.

102
00:08:16,898 --> 00:08:18,698
They're really touching.

103
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:23,497
Plagiarism. Touch up.

104
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:26,297
That actress was really beautiful.

105
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,797
Ugly.

106
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,197
What? Ugly?

107
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:32,897
No, maybe it's "big brother goes..."

108
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:36,097
Just what're you talking about, Shinichi?

109
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,997
What? The number plate of that car.

110
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:40,097
What?

111
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:43,097
10-39 is pronounced as "tosaku" (plagiarism),

112
00:08:43,098 --> 00:08:45,697
and the other car's plate is 23-19

113
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:47,097
which is pronounced as "busaiku" (ugly)

114
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:49,597
or pronounced "nii-san iku" (big brother goes).

115
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:52,297
In other words, I'm playing words with the number on cars' plate.

116
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,997
What are you doing something like?

117
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:57,697
Exercising my brain because I'm a detective.

118
00:08:57,698 --> 00:09:00,297
It also serves as practice for solving codes.

119
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:01,497
Oh, my.

120
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:03,997
34-2 stands for "misshitsu" (behind closed-doors).

121
00:09:03,998 --> 00:09:06,698
93-89 stands for "kusayakyu" (amateur baseball).

122
00:09:09,498 --> 00:09:10,997
48-6?

123
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:12,297
Pronounced as "yowamushi" (weakling).

124
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:13,797
89-31.

125
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:14,997
Pronounced as "hakusai" (Chinese cabbage).

126
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:17,797
It's amazing that you can think it up one after the other.

127
00:09:17,798 --> 00:09:19,697
The one that made me laugh the other day was...

128
00:09:19,698 --> 00:09:21,597
Despite it being a flower shop vehicle,

129
00:09:21,598 --> 00:09:23,597
the number plate was 80-83.

130
00:09:23,598 --> 00:09:25,698
80-83?

131
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:29,397
"Yaoya-san" (A vegetable shop)?

132
00:09:29,398 --> 00:09:30,398
Yes.

133
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,697
A flower shop should be 87-8.

134
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,297
You can say that again.

135
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:37,097
Oh, wait.

136
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:41,897
Meat shop is 29-83.

137
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:44,697
And fish shop is 37-83, right?

138
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:46,197
There's still more, Ran.

139
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:49,397
A bath shop is 26-8.

140
00:09:49,398 --> 00:09:51,897
And bean curd shop without the "san" at the end would be...

141
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:53,898
-10-2. -10-2.

142
00:09:56,798 --> 00:09:58,797
Recently, people get to choose the numbers they want to use

143
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,997
for their number plates as long as they request it,

144
00:10:01,998 --> 00:10:05,997
but before this law was passed, there were no numbers ending in 42 or 49.

145
00:10:05,998 --> 00:10:07,997
Why not?

146
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,797
42 is pronounced as "shining" (dead person).

147
00:10:09,798 --> 00:10:12,697
And 49 is pronounced as "shako" (death and suffering).

148
00:10:12,698 --> 00:10:15,297
Dead people? Death and suffering?

149
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:18,498
But recently, people doesn't seem to be bothered by things like that.

150
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:22,097
See, look at that.

151
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:25,298
46-49 or pronounced as "yoroshiku" (hello) seems to be quite popular.

152
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:30,297
The numbers that are really popular

153
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:33,097
can't be acquired unless you win the lottery for the numbers.

154
00:10:33,098 --> 00:10:36,097
For instance, 11-22.

155
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:37,997
11-22?

156
00:10:37,998 --> 00:10:39,697
Pronounced as "iifufu" (a married couple who gets along great).

157
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:41,498
See, look over there.

158
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:50,297
A married couple who gets along great.

159
00:10:50,298 --> 00:10:54,898
I sure would like Dad to use a number like that if he ever buys a car.

160
00:10:59,298 --> 00:11:02,597
No. Your Dad's taste would be something like...

161
00:11:02,598 --> 00:11:06,097
10-70 or 81-09.

162
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,597
10-70 or 81-09?

163
00:11:09,598 --> 00:11:10,997
10-70 pronounced as "ii onna" (foxy lady)

164
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:12,397
or 81-09 pronounced as "hairegu" (high cut revealing outfit)!

165
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:14,598
Gosh! How rude.

166
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:21,897
Shinichi, what numbers would you prefer?

167
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:22,997
Huh?

168
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:26,697
41-910 for Shinichi Kudo.

169
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:28,698
-Huh? -There's one extra number there.

170
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:34,297
I get it. 41-1.

171
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:36,897
41-10...

172
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:38,197
That's quite good.

173
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,897
Right?

174
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:41,297
But too bad.

175
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:42,597
Huh?

176
00:11:42,598 --> 00:11:44,397
Hiragana characters can't be chosen.

177
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:45,398
Moreover,

178
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,297
the Hiraganas that are in the "A" and "KA" rows of the Japanese alphabet

179
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:49,097
cannot be used for cars for private use.

180
00:11:49,098 --> 00:11:51,297
Is that so?

181
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:53,998
Well, if I were to choose, it would be...

182
00:11:57,698 --> 00:11:59,098
That car...

183
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:02,097
Shinichi?

184
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,798
What about that car?

185
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:08,597
Hey.

186
00:12:08,598 --> 00:12:10,397
Watch out.

187
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:12,198
Please sit down.

188
00:12:17,398 --> 00:12:19,197
Shoots.

189
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,597
Driver, can you...

190
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:23,098
Of course he can't go after that car.

191
00:12:25,498 --> 00:12:27,197
We'll be stopping at the next stop.

192
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:30,198
Hey. What's up, Shinichi?

193
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:48,598
Shinichi?

194
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:25,513
Darn it!

195
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:30,163
Officer!

196
00:13:30,164 --> 00:13:32,563
A car with a fraudulent license plate just went by.

197
00:13:32,564 --> 00:13:34,063
A fraudulent license plate?

198
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:39,364
It's a black sedan with the plate number "Shinjuku 510-shi 15-64".

199
00:13:40,364 --> 00:13:43,764
But how do you know that the car has a fraudulent license plate number?

200
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:49,064
15-64 pronounced as "hitogoroshi" (murderer).

201
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:56,763
I mean you guys, just because the number can be read as "murderer"...

202
00:13:56,764 --> 00:14:00,063
The point is not the numbers, but rather, the Hiragana character.

203
00:14:00,064 --> 00:14:01,163
There should be no license plate numbers

204
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:03,464
with the characters "shi" and "he".

205
00:14:06,064 --> 00:14:09,763
Going around like that with a fraudulent license plate numbers

206
00:14:09,764 --> 00:14:15,563
shows that they've planned out a crime and are about to execute it.

207
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,163
You've got to go after them!

208
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:18,264
Okay.

209
00:14:19,664 --> 00:14:21,263
Leave it to me!

210
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:23,763
Ran, you should go home.

211
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:26,064
Shinichi.

212
00:14:32,364 --> 00:14:34,163
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

213
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,563
Shinichi.

214
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:38,563
So what happened after that?

215
00:14:38,564 --> 00:14:39,963
I was worried.

216
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:41,463
Sorry, sorry.

217
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:47,463
Those guys fell under the category number 510 and not 15-64.

218
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:49,263
510?

219
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,863
It's "goto" (robber).

220
00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:55,063
But thanks to my deduction it ended with just an attempt.

221
00:14:55,064 --> 00:14:56,963
So they were arrested?

222
00:14:56,964 --> 00:15:00,163
Sort of. Those idiots used numbers

223
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:05,763
that symbolized "robber and murderer" to challenge the police.

224
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:08,464
But placing "shi" on the number plate was taking it a bit too far.

225
00:15:09,164 --> 00:15:11,763
By the way, about your father,

226
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:15,564
if he were to choose a number plate, how about 55-45?

227
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:19,363
55-45?

228
00:15:19,364 --> 00:15:21,163
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

229
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:22,964
Shinichi.

230
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:30,363
Hey, Dad. If you were to buy a car...

231
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:33,963
Shut up. Yoko Okino's coming on air soon.

232
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:35,063
Yoko!

233
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:39,863
You viewers out there get to see my live concert today!

234
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:41,763
Go! Go!

235
00:15:41,764 --> 00:15:44,463
Let's go, Yoko!

236
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:46,864
Yoko... Go, go...

237
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:50,564
It's 55-45 (Go! Go! Yoko).

238
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:58,063
5545.

239
00:15:58,064 --> 00:16:00,164
I'll try it, just in case.

240
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:06,564
I guess not. After all he's not Dad.

241
00:16:09,164 --> 00:16:10,964
But back then, if I remember it correctly...

242
00:16:13,464 --> 00:16:16,563
Well, if I were to choose, it would be...

243
00:16:16,564 --> 00:16:19,464
I wonder what Shinichi was trying to say.

244
00:16:20,464 --> 00:16:24,764
If it's a four digit number, he could be using it as a password.

245
00:16:33,664 --> 00:16:36,963
But it might be a good idea to it out.

246
00:16:36,964 --> 00:16:38,563
For instance...

247
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:42,964
Right. Like 4062 for Holmes.

248
00:16:44,364 --> 00:16:48,163
No good. It's still locked.

249
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:49,164
Lock.

250
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:53,763
Right, Holmes' first name is Sherlock.

251
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:56,463
4862.

252
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:58,164
Well, I guess I'll try it.

253
00:17:02,864 --> 00:17:04,763
What?

254
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:06,863
Seriuosly? It opened!

255
00:17:06,864 --> 00:17:09,163
What shall I do? What shall I do?

256
00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:10,963
Oh, no.

257
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:12,664
I've unlocked it.

258
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,763
I've got to check.

259
00:17:22,764 --> 00:17:27,064
I've got to check whether he received my mail or not.

260
00:17:32,664 --> 00:17:36,663
My mail isn't here?

261
00:17:36,664 --> 00:17:41,163
I see. He deleted it just in case.

262
00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:44,064
But that won't work cautious detective!

263
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:49,064
All I have to do is re-send this morning's mail to find out.

264
00:17:52,764 --> 00:17:54,864
Huh? It's not coming in.

265
00:17:58,064 --> 00:17:59,964
Why?

266
00:18:00,964 --> 00:18:03,163
Why?

267
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:07,763
How strange. The mail address is correct.

268
00:18:07,764 --> 00:18:09,164
Strange.

269
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:13,663
The telephone!

270
00:18:13,664 --> 00:18:14,664
Telephone?

271
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,663
Yes, hello?

272
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,863
What is it?

273
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:20,963
What?

274
00:18:20,964 --> 00:18:23,763
Sending the same mail over and over.

275
00:18:23,764 --> 00:18:25,863
What's the matter with you?

276
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:27,164
Shinichi?

277
00:18:29,364 --> 00:18:31,563
Just what time do you think it is now?

278
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:32,564
It's in the middle of the night you know?

279
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:33,664
Who is it?

280
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:44,763
I'm working day in and day out on cases and are fast asleep.

281
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:46,364
Until you call and wake me up.

282
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:49,364
Conan?

283
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:51,363
Do you know where my cell phone is?

284
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,964
I've been searching for it for a while.

285
00:18:55,564 --> 00:18:56,863
Isn't that mine?

286
00:18:56,864 --> 00:18:59,163
-Think about me, will you? -Sorry.

287
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:02,364
I picked it up in the car, and forgot to tell you about it.

288
00:19:06,064 --> 00:19:07,463
Huh?

289
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:10,263
It was supposed to have been locked.

290
00:19:10,264 --> 00:19:11,563
Did you look inside?

291
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:13,863
Nope.

292
00:19:13,864 --> 00:19:15,263
I didn't look inside.

293
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:17,063
But why are you so concerned?

294
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:23,363
Because mails from the girl I like are in here, too.

295
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:26,263
Oh, I see. Right.

296
00:19:26,264 --> 00:19:28,464
Let me give you a piece of my mind.

297
00:19:29,964 --> 00:19:31,563
Goodnight.

298
00:19:31,564 --> 00:19:33,263
Okay, goodnight.

299
00:19:33,264 --> 00:19:35,163
You've always been like that.

300
00:19:35,164 --> 00:19:38,963
-I see, that's why Conan was so flustered. -Hey, are you listening?

301
00:19:38,964 --> 00:19:42,164
-He didn't want me to see the mails he received from girls. -I'm sleepy.

302
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:48,964
You keep on repeating the same thing over and over and over.

303
00:19:50,664 --> 00:19:53,763
Tell me once and I get the message.

304
00:19:53,764 --> 00:19:56,663
Hey, Ran. Are you listening?

305
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:59,563
What was that mail about anyway?

306
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:01,463
I'm sorry, Shinichi.

307
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:04,964
I must've been mistaken about something again.

308
00:20:06,264 --> 00:20:09,763
I'm sure glad Doc's cell phone was the same type as mine.

309
00:20:09,764 --> 00:20:10,963
You can't tell the difference between the two

310
00:20:10,964 --> 00:20:12,863
after the straps are exchanged.

311
00:20:12,864 --> 00:20:17,163
It sure took a while before I got mail from Ran though.

312
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:19,563
I locked the cell phone to buy time,

313
00:20:19,564 --> 00:20:23,763
but maybe the password 4869 (Sherlock) was a bit too difficult.

314
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,263
But that's the word numbers I could find

315
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:29,063
that was common for both Conan and I.

316
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:33,464
I'm so happy I got to hear Shinichi's voice after such a long time.

317
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:37,263
Because even if I want to hear his voice,

318
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:39,363
it's hard for me to get a hold of him from my side.

319
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,363
Please don't get me wrong.

320
00:20:41,364 --> 00:20:44,763
There's no deep meaning to it.

321
00:20:44,764 --> 00:20:48,464
You idiot. Take a good look at your cell phone display.

322
00:20:51,164 --> 00:20:53,863
What? This is...

323
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:56,163
This is your phone number, Shinichi?

324
00:20:56,164 --> 00:20:59,263
You mean, you don't mind giving it to me?

325
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:01,763
I may call you at the wrong time, you know?

326
00:21:01,764 --> 00:21:03,163
No.

327
00:21:03,164 --> 00:21:06,664
But I'm so busy that most times all you'll get is my answerphone.

328
00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:10,863
I figured that sometimes there are things that can't be relayed correctly

329
00:21:10,864 --> 00:21:12,064
unless they are spoken.

330
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:15,064
That's right.

331
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:20,263
It's a bit risky telling her what my number is, but...

332
00:21:20,264 --> 00:21:22,563
Well, if it's this kind of risk,

333
00:21:22,564 --> 00:21:24,464
it's worth it.

334
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,563
Hey, what's with you two? Didn't you guys get enough sleep?

335
00:23:05,564 --> 00:23:07,863
Well, sort of.

336
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:12,163
I couldn't help but remembered about a case that happened half a year ago.

337
00:23:12,164 --> 00:23:13,863
Half a year ago?

338
00:23:13,864 --> 00:23:16,063
Half a year ago?

339
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:19,963
What's the license number plate of Mother's car, Dad?

340
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:20,964
Eri's?

341
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:23,464
I think it was "Shinjuku"...

342
00:23:26,564 --> 00:23:29,963
It's "36-ge 87-07".

343
00:23:29,964 --> 00:23:32,863
What? The Hiragana "ge"?

344
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,064
Look at that. "36-ge 87-07."

345
00:23:37,664 --> 00:23:39,864
See! What a revolting woman!

346
00:23:46,064 --> 00:23:47,764
Gosh. Dad!

347
00:23:48,964 --> 00:23:50,863
Well, I guess they'll continue living separated for a while yet.

348
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:52,563
22-97 (tsuzuku-na) which means will continue.

349
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,963
Conan, what did you just say? Something about continuing?

350
00:23:54,964 --> 00:23:55,964
What?

351
00:23:57,864 --> 00:24:06,963
"Next Episode."

352
00:24:06,964 --> 00:24:08,064
He smiled?

353
00:24:21,864 --> 00:24:27,864
Next Conan, "A Jewel Thief Caught Red-Handed (Part 1)"

354
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:45,763
Next Conan's Hint:

355
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:47,963
"Broche."

356
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:49,163
Coming up next is the 510 incident.

357
00:24:49,164 --> 00:24:51,163
I got it, a person named Goto is the culprit.

358
00:24:51,164 --> 00:24:52,764
It's a robbery (goto) case.
