1
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:05,447
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:07,447
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,448 --> 00:00:09,147
Sonoko's world in Karuizawa.

4
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:11,047
A troublesome case as expected.

5
00:00:11,048 --> 00:00:12,547
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:14,547
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:16,548
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,725
Hey! Ran!

9
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:01,325
Hurry up.

10
00:02:01,326 --> 00:02:03,125
We're running late!

11
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:05,425
Okay, I'll be right there!

12
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:06,525
Geez...

13
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,025
Come on, Mr. Mouri.

14
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:09,725
It's nothing to get heated up over.

15
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:11,225
Shut up!

16
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:13,825
Why do I, Kogoro Mouri,

17
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:16,925
have to serve as a driver for two sassy chicks?

18
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:19,225
Moreover, you're from the Suzuki Financial Group,

19
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:21,125
don't you even have your own chauffeur?

20
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:25,025
No way! I don't want a chauffeur driving me around on vacation.

21
00:02:25,026 --> 00:02:28,425
I hate feeling like I'm being watched!

22
00:02:28,426 --> 00:02:31,225
Is that so...

23
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:32,726
Yes, that's how it is.

24
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:36,325
Well, there's one kid who's got a cold,

25
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:38,525
so be careful you don't catch it.

26
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:41,125
Conan has a cold?

27
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:42,925
Thank you for waiting!

28
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:45,625
I took time trying to get Conan ready.

29
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:47,825
Are you going to be all right, Conan?

30
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:49,425
You got a cold, don't you?

31
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:51,025
Yes, I'm fine, just fine.

32
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:53,126
I just got the sniffles!

33
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:57,125
Okay, so now that we're all set!

34
00:02:57,126 --> 00:03:00,625
Off we go to Karuizawa!

35
00:03:00,626 --> 00:03:02,326
Yes, ma'am.

36
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:11,526
"The Suspicious Spicy Curry (Part 1)"

37
00:03:17,326 --> 00:03:19,325
Are you okay, Conan?

38
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:21,025
Yes, I'm fine.

39
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:22,425
If you start feeling bad,

40
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:23,825
tell me right away, okay?

41
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:25,225
Okay!

42
00:03:25,226 --> 00:03:27,125
Gosh, if you have a cold,

43
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:29,625
why didn't you just stay home?

44
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,825
The owner of Poirot Cafe

45
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:35,425
offered to watch you one whole day today.

46
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:41,025
But I want to see Sonoko's villa in Karuizawa too!

47
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:42,925
Geez.

48
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:45,225
And besides, knowing Sonoko for what she is,

49
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:48,125
she'll probably think up some bad ideas like always.

50
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:50,125
Maybe we'll find a really good mate!

51
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:53,325
What? We're going boy-hunting playing tennis?

52
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:54,525
That's right!

53
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,525
Just about this time, there are many university students

54
00:03:57,526 --> 00:03:59,725
at the tennis courts near the villa.

55
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:01,625
Gosh. If you do something like that,

56
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:04,225
Kyogoku's going to get mad at you!

57
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:06,125
What do you mean by that?

58
00:04:06,126 --> 00:04:09,726
Of course, he's the only guy for me.

59
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:13,025
You're the one who's going to get someone today!

60
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:14,825
What?

61
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:17,325
You'll wear your tennis wear to show off your great body

62
00:04:17,326 --> 00:04:19,125
to the university students.

63
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,625
You'll take a snapshot with him

64
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:22,725
and send it to him as a mail attachment!

65
00:04:22,726 --> 00:04:26,825
You'll do all this to get Kudo, that boyfriend of yours, jealous!

66
00:04:26,826 --> 00:04:28,925
How about it?

67
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:32,325
I don't think he'll get jealous.

68
00:04:32,326 --> 00:04:35,325
Just as I thought...

69
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:39,525
Besides, the only thing I have is a Teitan High School jersey uniform.

70
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:41,225
I don't have tennis wear.

71
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:43,525
Don't you worry!

72
00:04:43,526 --> 00:04:46,725
I bought tennis wear for you and brought it along.

73
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:50,025
Geez...

74
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:51,225
Look at this!

75
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:53,526
It's super mini and cute too!

76
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:56,825
Short!

77
00:04:56,826 --> 00:04:59,825
Hey! I could never wear something like that!

78
00:04:59,826 --> 00:05:03,325
I didn't bring my safety pants with me either!

79
00:05:03,326 --> 00:05:04,425
I see...

80
00:05:04,426 --> 00:05:07,025
It can't be helped then.

81
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:10,225
I guess you'll just have to wear a regular panties then, Ran.

82
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,126
Regular panties?

83
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:18,325
Darn it! I'd love to see it.

84
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:19,925
But I don't want others to see it.

85
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:22,525
Hey. I don't know what you two are blabbering about

86
00:05:22,526 --> 00:05:24,225
but if my daughter is going to be humiliated

87
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:26,225
just for that detective brat,

88
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,625
I'm heading back home.

89
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:29,925
You can if you want too but...

90
00:05:29,926 --> 00:05:33,725
There are going to be a lot of voluptuous girls there too.

91
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:34,826
What?

92
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:39,826
University girls!

93
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:49,125
The weather was so nice in the morning, but now...

94
00:05:49,126 --> 00:05:52,725
My voluptuous university girls...

95
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:55,225
We can't play tennis in this weather.

96
00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:58,325
I don't know if I should be happy or sad about this.

97
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:00,025
Oh, well...

98
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,625
I thought I'll get to see Ran's panty glimpse with tennis shorts

99
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:04,925
that I haven't seen in a while today.

100
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:06,525
Too bad!

101
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:09,326
Well, I guess I should be glad.

102
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:13,625
Somebody's on the tennis court.

103
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:17,026
Maybe they're my voluptuous girls...

104
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:22,325
Darn it. It's a guy.

105
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:24,525
May I help you with something?

106
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:25,526
What?

107
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:27,525
A handsome guy.

108
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:29,525
Oh, no...

109
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:31,825
"Hiroto Akashi (32)" -I was just recalling memories

110
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:33,426
when I first met my wife here.

111
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:37,025
Geez. He's already taken...

112
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:39,825
If all of you came to play tennis,

113
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:42,525
would you like me to coach you on how to play better?

114
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:46,125
I'm a tennis instructor.

115
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:47,825
My house is near here too,

116
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:49,026
so if you'd like...

117
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:54,225
Thank you for your offer,

118
00:06:54,226 --> 00:06:55,725
but I don't think so...

119
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:57,025
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:57,026 --> 00:06:58,026
I see.

121
00:06:58,027 --> 00:06:59,725
That's too bad.

122
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:00,926
So long.

123
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:08,625
So we couldn't fish any men after all.

124
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:10,325
Okay, let's go...

125
00:07:10,326 --> 00:07:13,325
fish instead then!

126
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:16,525
Hey... What's with this turn of events?

127
00:07:16,526 --> 00:07:17,526
Just watch!

128
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:21,425
I'll catch us some delicious fish for dinner!

129
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:24,425
The Chef and my older sister are already preparing dinner

130
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:27,126
and waiting for us there.

131
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:31,526
It seems like the river water is increasing.

132
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:35,825
Geez... It took my float and all again.

133
00:07:35,826 --> 00:07:38,225
That's because you don't tie it well enough!

134
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:40,225
Fish lines are slippery

135
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,426
so unless you tie them like this...

136
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:47,525
Hey, your fishing line is being pulled, Mr. Mouri!

137
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:48,526
What?

138
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:51,726
Hey, this is a big one!

139
00:07:57,526 --> 00:07:59,825
My rental car?

140
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:02,325
-No way! -It's been carried into the river!

141
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:04,125
Didn't I tell you that

142
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:07,325
you parked the car too close to the edge of the river.

143
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:09,026
Why you...

144
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:11,525
Dad!

145
00:08:11,526 --> 00:08:12,725
Darn it!

146
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,225
I'm not letting the river take the car!

147
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:16,326
You can't do anything about it already, Dad!

148
00:08:24,826 --> 00:08:26,925
Hey, are you okay?

149
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:30,825
I'm fine, although my right wrist hurts a bit.

150
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:32,925
I wonder if you sprained it.

151
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:36,325
You probably landed on it when you fell into the river.

152
00:08:36,326 --> 00:08:39,125
Well, it's way better than being stranded in the water.

153
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:41,525
This is no time for jokes!

154
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:43,026
Yes, ma'am.

155
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:48,825
But, what do we do now?

156
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:51,925
All our things have drifted away with the car.

157
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:54,125
Our cell phones aren't working because we're out of range.

158
00:08:54,126 --> 00:08:56,825
And it's gotten dark after all this walking.

159
00:08:56,826 --> 00:08:58,925
On top of that,

160
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:01,425
don't you two think that maybe we're lost?

161
00:09:01,426 --> 00:09:02,426
-What? -What?

162
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:06,825
Hey, you mean you were walking around not knowing where you were?

163
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:09,325
Well, I was just kind of trusting my intuition.

164
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:12,026
Geez, what now?

165
00:09:12,826 --> 00:09:13,826
There's light.

166
00:09:13,827 --> 00:09:15,225
What?

167
00:09:15,226 --> 00:09:17,225
See, over there.

168
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:20,025
You mean there are people living out in the mountains like this?

169
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,125
I'm sure it's a mountain witch!

170
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:26,525
Let's have her put us up for a while then.

171
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:27,825
-What? -What?

172
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:32,026
We got to get some dry clothes for this brat, don't we?

173
00:09:33,826 --> 00:09:36,325
Excuse me.

174
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,325
I'm sorry to be intruding on you at this hour,

175
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:39,726
but is anybody home?

176
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:46,025
He's coming out!

177
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:49,025
You guys are the ones who've come out.

178
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:50,325
"Iwao Akashi (65), Hiroto's Father"

179
00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:53,425
So, you're solicitors of some kind again?

180
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,425
I won't be deceived even if you bring kids along with you!

181
00:09:55,426 --> 00:09:57,725
No, we're...

182
00:09:57,726 --> 00:09:59,325
Go home! Go home!

183
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:02,425
This is no place for swindlers like you to come!

184
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:05,325
Who is it, father?

185
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:07,726
You people are...

186
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:12,125
What a laugh!

187
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:14,625
You fell into the river trying to fish your car

188
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:16,125
that drifted into the river.

189
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:18,425
It's no laughing matter.

190
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:19,625
Sorry...

191
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:21,025
But he'll be fine!

192
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:23,425
With a little compress and by fixing his wrist in place,

193
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:27,325
if it's just a sprain, he'll recover in no time.

194
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,526
Turn this way and let me look into your mouth.

195
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:35,525
Your throat is red and your voice is hoarse,

196
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:38,225
so try not to use your voice too much.

197
00:10:38,226 --> 00:10:40,825
You may come down with acute laryngitis.

198
00:10:40,826 --> 00:10:42,025
Okay.

199
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:44,325
It's as if you're a doctor...

200
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:49,325
Yeah, I learned a lot when I was coaching tennis players

201
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:52,625
to prepare them for competitions.

202
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:56,825
How do the clothes of when I was a child fit you?

203
00:10:56,826 --> 00:10:58,825
They fit like a glove!

204
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:01,525
That's great then.

205
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:03,725
I smell curry?

206
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:07,225
Yes. It's left-over from last night, though.

207
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:09,525
If you don't mind, would you like some?

208
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:11,726
Can I?

209
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:19,125
This is good!

210
00:11:19,126 --> 00:11:21,025
It's as good as the kind you eat at a restaurant!

211
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:22,825
Really! It's delicious!

212
00:11:22,826 --> 00:11:24,425
Since you have a sore throat,

213
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:26,025
you eat eggs over rice, okay, Conan?

214
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:27,125
Okay...

215
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:30,525
I like the spiciness of this curry!

216
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:32,425
Your wife must be a good cook!

217
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:34,025
Oh, well...

218
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,925
I'm the one who made this.

219
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:41,026
My wife passed away three years ago today.

220
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,725
I see...

221
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:46,925
That's why you were at the tennis court recalling memories of her.

222
00:11:46,926 --> 00:11:49,625
Well, when I was trainer, I also made meals for the players

223
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,325
while taking their body condition into consideration too.

224
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:57,125
I was also better at cooking than my wife.

225
00:11:57,126 --> 00:12:01,325
I'm going to take curry to father who is upstairs,

226
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:02,825
so please help yourself to seconds if you wish.

227
00:12:02,826 --> 00:12:04,526
Oh, okay.

228
00:12:11,226 --> 00:12:13,325
Dad, I brought you your meal.

229
00:12:13,326 --> 00:12:14,526
Yeah.

230
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,625
Mr. Hiroto is sure taking his time.

231
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,926
It's already been 40 minutes since then.

232
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:32,125
This is really getting on my nerves.

233
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,325
What is?

234
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:37,525
This long cable hanging from the light above!

235
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:39,725
It's getting in the way of me trying to eat.

236
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,025
Stop complaining.

237
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,725
You already had two servings.

238
00:12:43,726 --> 00:12:46,126
That cable is for dad.

239
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:51,025
He wanted an electric cable that he could reach because he's hunched over.

240
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:53,225
Oh, I see...

241
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:55,325
You sure took a long time,

242
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:57,725
when all you did was go to give him his curry.

243
00:12:57,726 --> 00:12:58,726
Yeah.

244
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:00,325
Dad started saying strange things

245
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:03,125
so we got to talking with each other.

246
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:06,525
He said he's not eating because he wants to die out of the blue.

247
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:09,025
-What? -Wants to die?

248
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:13,225
It seems that he thinks that he is being disliked by God

249
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:17,725
because he's lost his wife as well as his daughter-in-law.

250
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:19,125
Well, he seems to be okay now

251
00:13:19,126 --> 00:13:21,625
since he's started eating curry, which is also his favorite dish.

252
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:23,326
So please don't worry about it.

253
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:29,125
What? The road is blocked because of a landslide

254
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:31,325
and you can't come to pick us up today?

255
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:33,125
Are you serious?

256
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:35,825
You can stay over here then.

257
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:38,625
We've got a lot of mattresses here too.

258
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:41,425
I'm sorry to trouble you, but thank you very much.

259
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:42,825
Oh, right.

260
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:45,325
Will you go get father's dish for me?

261
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,526
Yes, sure!

262
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:54,025
But he's very jittery as well as a slow eater.

263
00:13:54,026 --> 00:13:57,125
If the room light is on, it means he's still eating,

264
00:13:57,126 --> 00:14:00,625
so come back without making a sound, okay?

265
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:01,826
Okay.

266
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:08,925
The light of the room is...

267
00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:11,125
It's still on.

268
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:13,326
Quiet...

269
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:18,326
He's crying?

270
00:14:23,926 --> 00:14:25,725
No, not like that.

271
00:14:25,726 --> 00:14:27,225
Forehand goes like this.

272
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:28,326
Okay.

273
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:35,025
I'm sure he's already finished eating by now.

274
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:38,625
I'll go back up to get his dishes again.

275
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:40,625
Thank you.

276
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:42,526
I'll go too.

277
00:14:43,726 --> 00:14:46,726
Quietly...

278
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:51,126
Okay, the lights are out.

279
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,726
What? He's not in bed.

280
00:15:21,683 --> 00:15:22,783
Ran?

281
00:15:30,683 --> 00:15:32,683
He's bleeding from his mouth?

282
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:37,582
Ran! What's the matter?

283
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,683
That is...

284
00:15:40,183 --> 00:15:42,482
Father...

285
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,682
No way.

286
00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:46,182
Hey, what's going on?

287
00:15:46,183 --> 00:15:47,383
What...

288
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:55,482
He's still warm,

289
00:15:55,483 --> 00:15:59,182
but his toes are starting to stiffen.

290
00:15:59,183 --> 00:16:02,682
He's estimated to have been dead for about 30 minutes.

291
00:16:02,683 --> 00:16:04,582
Excuse me, Mr. Hiroto.

292
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,782
Will you please call the police?

293
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:08,682
Sure.

294
00:16:08,683 --> 00:16:11,883
I guess the officers of the Gunma prefecture will be coming.

295
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:16,582
Hey. If it's Gunma Prefecture...

296
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,683
No way.

297
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:24,382
"Gunma Prefecture"

298
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,382
Summoned and here I am!

299
00:16:27,383 --> 00:16:28,982
If it's for you, Mr. Mouri,

300
00:16:28,983 --> 00:16:30,482
I'll go through fire and water.

301
00:16:30,483 --> 00:16:32,182
The roads may be blocked because of the rain,

302
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:34,682
but I've come as fast as possible because you have called me!

303
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:37,783
I wonder if the Gunma police station has nobody else to dispatch?

304
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:42,382
And? What kind of murder case is it this time?

305
00:16:42,383 --> 00:16:44,282
What's the murder weapon? Any evidence?

306
00:16:44,283 --> 00:16:47,382
You're going to do it, right? The Sleeping Kogoro deduction show!

307
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,682
Stop smiling all over the place at a place like this.

308
00:16:49,683 --> 00:16:51,482
For God's sake, talk about lacking prudence.

309
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:54,782
Besides, we're not even sure if this is a homicide either yet.

310
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,282
There's the dead body.

311
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,982
Don't tell me that this is...

312
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:03,682
The one who passed away is the head of this house, Mr. Iwao Akashi.

313
00:17:03,683 --> 00:17:04,982
The one who found him is

314
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:11,182
my daughter, Ran, who went to clear his dish.

315
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:12,682
When she found him,

316
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:15,382
the light of this room on the second floor was turned off.

317
00:17:15,383 --> 00:17:19,682
But when she checked an hour and a half earlier the light was on,

318
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:21,682
so she thought he was still eating his curry

319
00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:23,982
and didn't enter the room.

320
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:26,882
I checked right away after the incident

321
00:17:26,883 --> 00:17:29,682
but the victim seems to have been dead for about 30 minutes.

322
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:31,582
There were four of us in the house then

323
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,982
but all of us were in the living room on the first floor

324
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:36,982
from two hours before the incident, so we all have an alibi.

325
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:39,382
Well, the only one who wasn't in the living room all the time was me

326
00:17:39,383 --> 00:17:41,982
because I was taking a bath.

327
00:17:41,983 --> 00:17:44,682
Which means that you're the only one

328
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:47,782
who could've committed the murder, Mr. Mouri!

329
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:52,382
I came to this house for the first time today!

330
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,082
I don't even know where the rope is,

331
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,582
so how could I have done it?

332
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,682
Oh, is that so?

333
00:17:57,683 --> 00:17:59,182
It's a bit of a concern

334
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:01,882
that the victim is bleeding from his mouth

335
00:18:01,883 --> 00:18:03,882
but as you can obviously see...

336
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:04,982
What?

337
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,482
Why is it of any concern?

338
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:07,782
I thought that people who die like this

339
00:18:07,783 --> 00:18:09,982
always bleed from their mouths?

340
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:10,983
Yes...

341
00:18:10,984 --> 00:18:14,382
I've seen scenes like that in movies and dramas.

342
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:16,682
That's not true.

343
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:18,282
The doctor once told me that

344
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:20,482
when something is wrapped around your throat,

345
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:22,282
your face gets swollen because the blood circulation is stopped,

346
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:24,082
and unless you have a wound in your mouth or something,

347
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,282
you don't bleed from the mouth!

348
00:18:26,283 --> 00:18:28,682
So I think in the movies or dramas,

349
00:18:28,683 --> 00:18:30,882
they go out of their way to do so

350
00:18:30,883 --> 00:18:32,583
to make it visually obvious that the person is dead.

351
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,382
No, don't talk.

352
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,682
You'll strain your throat because of your cold.

353
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:42,182
But, if it's just as the boy just said,

354
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:44,882
I wonder why he's bleeding from his mouth.

355
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:46,182
I think it's because he was going to the dentist

356
00:18:46,183 --> 00:18:49,182
to get his teeth treated.

357
00:18:49,183 --> 00:18:50,183
He told me that he was going to the dentist

358
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:52,682
because his tooth was hurting.

359
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:55,382
May I ask who you are?

360
00:18:55,383 --> 00:18:58,182
I'm Iwao Akashi's son, Hiroto.

361
00:18:58,183 --> 00:19:03,082
Although I was adopted by him when I was a child.

362
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:07,782
His right molar's been pulled out.

363
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:09,782
It seems that after he died,

364
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:11,282
it bled from here

365
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,182
and blood came out when he drooled.

366
00:19:14,183 --> 00:19:19,482
Mr. Hiroto, do you know when and which dentist that your father went to?

367
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:20,982
Well...

368
00:19:20,983 --> 00:19:24,482
he left to go about two or three days ago.

369
00:19:24,483 --> 00:19:26,882
Who cares about it at this point?

370
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:29,082
We already know that this is suicide.

371
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,282
What?

372
00:19:30,283 --> 00:19:34,782
He probably used this ladder here.

373
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:39,782
He got on here and pulled the rope through the thick beam there.

374
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:41,782
No doubt this is suicide.

375
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:43,582
According to what Mr. Hiroto told us,

376
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,882
he said that his father was saying he wanted to die.

377
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:47,382
No way...

378
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:48,882
What am I going to do?

379
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:51,082
I told everybody back at the station

380
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,582
that I would video tape Sleeping Kogoro's deduction.

381
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,982
Gosh.

382
00:19:57,983 --> 00:20:00,882
What am I going to tell everybody when I get back to the station?

383
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:03,082
Well, all is well.

384
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,782
Now that it's suicide, you don't have to

385
00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:06,382
go through the trouble of investigating any further.

386
00:20:06,383 --> 00:20:08,382
Well, that's true, but...

387
00:20:08,383 --> 00:20:11,482
Hey, don't think it's strange?

388
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:13,682
This old man is bent over

389
00:20:13,683 --> 00:20:17,383
and only about 30cm taller than me and yet...

390
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:20,582
See! The electric cable for the light here

391
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,682
is made to fit the height of the old man and yet...

392
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:26,083
I can't reach it even if I stretch my arm out.

393
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,482
Now that you mentioned it.

394
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:33,082
Which means that this is not suicide but...

395
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,482
Well,

396
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,682
some time ago when father got up late at night,

397
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:39,482
the electric cable got in his eyes

398
00:20:39,483 --> 00:20:41,682
and he didn't like it all.

399
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:45,482
So only the electric cable in my father's room is short.

400
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:48,082
I see...

401
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,982
So, it is suicide after all.

402
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:51,282
Yes...

403
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,282
We'll be waiting in the living room downstairs then,

404
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:56,583
so if you have any questions just holler.

405
00:21:01,383 --> 00:21:03,082
I'm sorry.

406
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,682
For gotten all of you to be involved

407
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:07,782
in something like this on your vacation.

408
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:11,082
It's fine.

409
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,482
Do you go fishing too?

410
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:15,482
Because...

411
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,382
See. Fishing for Beginners.

412
00:21:18,383 --> 00:21:22,082
That's a book my wife bought.

413
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,882
The one who passed away from an illness three years ago?

414
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,182
Yes.

415
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:29,282
But, I've never seen her gone fishing,

416
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:33,482
so maybe she was planning to do so after she recovered.

417
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:35,082
Something's strange.

418
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,682
There's something strange about him.

419
00:21:37,683 --> 00:21:42,382
He let's Ran go all the way upstairs to get the dish,

420
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:46,282
the length of the electric cable of that room

421
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:49,382
and the thing about his father's teeth being treated are all fishy.

422
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:51,282
If he knew that his father had his teeth treated

423
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:52,682
two or three days ago,

424
00:21:52,683 --> 00:21:55,783
why would he make something spicy like curry?

425
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,882
If he was making food for the players

426
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:00,082
when he was a trainer

427
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,882
because he was concerned about their health,

428
00:22:01,883 --> 00:22:04,083
he should know of things like this.

429
00:22:05,383 --> 00:22:07,182
As for that curry,

430
00:22:07,183 --> 00:22:10,382
the amount that he made is way too much for just two of them.

431
00:22:10,383 --> 00:22:12,282
He couldn't have known beforehand

432
00:22:12,283 --> 00:22:14,683
that we would be coming here.

433
00:22:15,783 --> 00:22:17,182
And besides...

434
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:20,082
There must be something

435
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,282
with the way the electric cable is tied.

436
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:26,183
There is definitely something behind this case.

437
00:23:58,283 --> 00:24:00,282
"Next Episode" -What do you mean "come to think of it"?

438
00:24:00,283 --> 00:24:01,482
It's nothing.

439
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,782
But when I went in front of that room the first time,

440
00:24:04,783 --> 00:24:08,682
I heard the old man was crying.

441
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:11,582
I got the picture of this trick.

442
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,983
Okay then, now that I know.

443
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,382
This is bad!

444
00:24:20,383 --> 00:24:21,883
I lost my voice!

445
00:24:22,983 --> 00:24:24,282
