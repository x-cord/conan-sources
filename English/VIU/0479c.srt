1
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:18,099
"White. Highschool Detective in East" -So, now

2
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:19,699
"White. Highschool Detective in East" -since the high school detectives

3
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:21,499
of the east, west, south and north are all here

4
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:23,399
let's start with self-introduction!

5
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,699
Okay.

6
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:27,399
Are you're sure you don't mind the cameras not rolling?

7
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:31,099
I mean, there are no TV staff here at all!

8
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,599
Oh, the crew and TV talent who is MC for this program

9
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:35,499
are scheduled to be arriving tomorrow.

10
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:39,199
I wanted all of you to be here a day ahead.

11
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:40,599
Okay then.

12
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:43,699
I'm Natsuki Koshimizu, a junior in high school.

13
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:47,599
I was born in Fukuoka and is representing the south.

14
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:50,299
But, I've only solved about 100 cases to date,

15
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,999
so am still a beginner,

16
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:53,699
so take it easy on me, okay?

17
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,099
My name is Junya Tokitsu.

18
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:58,899
I was born in Tokyo, but since I was raised in Hokkaido,

19
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:01,399
I'm here representing the north.

20
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,699
I've solved up to 300 cases up to date.

21
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:06,999
People have been arrested and indicted in 250 of those cases.

22
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:08,799
But there were people who escaped

23
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,799
or committed suicide among them too.

24
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,199
I'm Heiji Hattori.

25
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:16,299
I'm pretty well-known in the Kansai district.

26
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:20,599
The number of cases that I've solved so far is one, two, three...

27
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:23,199
Well, with over a thousand cases to my name,

28
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,499
I've lost track already!

29
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:27,699
A thousand cases.

30
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:28,899
Wow.

31
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:32,299
Hey, stop bluffing like that.

32
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,599
It's true,

33
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,399
if I include the times I searched for cats in my childhood.

34
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,099
I see, so you're Heiji Hattori.

35
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,299
My dad used to talk a lot about you.

36
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,599
He said that you're a detective with very keen intuition.

37
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,599
Huh?

38
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,199
How come your dad knows me?

39
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:51,299
Because he's the same as you, Heiji.

40
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,299
Same as me?

41
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:54,299
Right, Hakuba?

42
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,399
Yeah, my father is a police commissioner.

43
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:58,599
So, strangely enough,

44
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,899
I lived in an environment similar to yours being that

45
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,399
your father was the leader of the Osaka Prefectural Police.

46
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,499
By the way, how many cases have you solved?

47
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:10,899
Well, I guess just about 500 cases.

48
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:12,899
What? That's only half the number compared to mine!

49
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,099
Yes, but that's if I limit the cases

50
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,499
to those that I solved here in Japan.

51
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:19,899
What?

52
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:22,399
I've been staying in England as an exchange student for awhile

53
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:25,199
and only returned to Japan occasionally,

54
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,599
but my nanny would take on requests

55
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:29,099
for solving cases of her own discretion.

56
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,899
It's so unexpected that

57
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:34,199
Hakuba who is famous abroad is here representing the east.

58
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:37,999
Yep, I was so sure that it was going to be Shinichi Kudo.

59
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:40,799
Right, the high school detective of the east

60
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:45,299
is none other than Shinichi Kudo, right? It's not you!

61
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:49,999
My nanny took the call from the director over there.

62
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:52,499
He said that he wanted me to participate in place of Shinichi Kudo

63
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:56,099
who he couldn't get a hold of as representative of the east.

64
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,599
Nanny was hurt by the phrase, "in place of"

65
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,599
and pleaded in tears for me to show the world

66
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,399
that Hakuba is the high school detective of the east.

67
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,699
So, I had no choice but to come back from England.

68
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:11,399
That's the story,

69
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,999
but it seems that I'm not suited to represent the east, am I?

70
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,699
Of course you're not.

71
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,299
Then, why don't we do this?

72
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,299
I'm a guest participant from abroad.

73
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:26,499
We'll appoint Conan Edogawa here as representative of the east.

74
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:29,699
This young man here is pretty good at deductions too.

75
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:31,399
I'm sure he is equal to if not better than the youth called...

76
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,999
what's his name, Kudo.

77
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:35,799
"What's his name"?

78
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,499
But he's still a child...

79
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:39,999
Who cares, no problem.

80
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:41,799
I'd like to go to my room quickly.

81
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:42,999
I'm pooped.

82
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:45,199
I'd like to have dinner too.

83
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,299
Oh, right.

84
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:50,699
Okay. Mr. Koya is making dinner now

85
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:53,199
so I'll come get all of you when it's ready.

86
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,999
Oh, and I'd like to check your outfits that you'll be wearing

87
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:57,199
when shooting the program tomorrow,

88
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,499
so please wear it when coming to dinner.

89
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:01,199
Make sure you wear outfits that suit the Detective Championship Game

90
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,099
as we talked over the telephone.

91
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:05,099
Huh, what?

92
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,999
There's no such program?

93
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,799
Is that true, Yoko?

94
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,199
No, I asked around the TV station,

95
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,999
but nobody's heard of a special program

96
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,399
called Detective Championship Game.

97
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:18,999
Are you sure the man was really from Nichiuri TV?

98
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:21,699
Yeah, he was wearing the stadium jumper of the station

99
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:25,599
and his name is Hiroo Tsuchio.

100
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,599
What?

101
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,199
There's no director by that name?

102
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,299
-Then who was that man... -That took the two of them?

103
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:35,499
I see,

104
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:38,099
that's what you call an outfit suited for the Detective Championship game.

105
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:40,599
Yeah, I hate to dress like this

106
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:42,899
other than to school or funerals.

107
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:47,899
But, what a surprise that you knew that snobbish guy.

108
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:49,799
Oh, you mean Suguru Hakuba.

109
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:51,599
I met him when solving a case in the past.

110
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:53,799
Did he get you that upset?

111
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:57,799
Yeah, I hate the snobbish way he talks, like he's looking down at you.

112
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:00,699
-He so much like you. -Oh...

113
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:04,599
Well, at least you're cute, so way better than him in a way, though.

114
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:05,799
I see.

115
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:09,399
But from here, we're enemies.

116
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:13,699
Don't talk to me no matter what comes up.

117
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:14,799
Come in?

118
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:19,999
Excuse me. Dinner's ready, so please come to the dining room.

119
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:24,499
This sure is an old lodge.

120
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:27,299
It looks to be fixed here and there, though.

121
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:28,899
Who owns this place?

122
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:32,099
I wonder? I hear that some rich person is renting it out

123
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,799
since he has no use for it anymore.

124
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:40,199
By the way, has she already gone to the dining room?

125
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,299
She?

126
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,299
No, I was just about to go call her now.

127
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:46,399
Is there a woman here on this island too?

128
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,799
She was with us all the while.

129
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,099
Yes!

130
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:54,799
Dinner's ready.

131
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,499
Oh, it's it time already?

132
00:05:56,499 --> 00:05:58,999
Oh no! I guess I took too much time!

133
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:02,299
You mean, she was a woman?

134
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:04,599
My school has strict rules.

135
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:06,299
Skirts have to be 3 cm below the knee,

136
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,799
scarves have to be symmetrical right and left,

137
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:08,899
socks have to be black,

138
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:10,399
and of course perms aren't allowed.

139
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,399
If we shave our eyebrows, we get suspended.

140
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,899
God knows how many times I was warned about

141
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,499
this naturally brown hair of mine.

142
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:17,999
But, I guess it's no big deal tonight

143
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:19,999
because the cameras aren't here yet, right?

144
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:22,099
Yeah, I guess so.

145
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:24,699
Hey, you didn't change clothes.

146
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,399
Yes, because unlike you people

147
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,199
the school that I attend in England has no uniform.

148
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:33,399
Wow, it looks delicious.

149
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,499
Did you make all this, sir?

150
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:38,399
-Yes. -Huh, where's the director?

151
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,699
When I went to get him at his room a while ago, there was no answer,

152
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:46,299
so I though he had already come here.

153
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:49,299
Please show me to his room.

154
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:51,199
Mr. Tsuchio.

155
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,199
Dinner's ready. Mr. Tsuchio?

156
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,499
No good, I guess he locked it so he could sleep.

157
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,699
Blood.

158
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:09,699
There's blood on the door knob.

159
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:12,399
-Do you have a spare key? -No, there is no key to begin with,

160
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,299
because like your rooms, the key can only be locked from inside.

161
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:18,799
If the rooms are the same, there should be two windows.

162
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:21,099
Then, let's look inside through the window.

163
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:24,199
You...

164
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:31,599
Mr. Tsuchio!

165
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:40,088
"Gray. Highschool Detective in North" -Mr. Tsuchio!

166
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:43,288
"Gray. Highschool Detective in North" -The window is locked.

167
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:46,288
It seems the door was completely locked too.

168
00:07:46,288 --> 00:07:48,388
Then, this is a locked door murder case?

169
00:07:48,388 --> 00:07:54,388
Yes, but obviously that's only if he's dead.

170
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:58,588
He's alive.

171
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:00,488
What happened?

172
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:02,388
What a relief! What happened?

173
00:08:02,388 --> 00:08:06,188
Oh, somebody knocked on the door.

174
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,788
I answered the door. But, there was no one there.

175
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:11,288
When I was about to go back into the room,

176
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:14,188
I was suddenly drugged from behind.

177
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:18,588
Problem number one of the Detective Championship Game!

178
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:20,988
Solve this locked room mystery.

179
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:23,888
After solving the mystery, write it down

180
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:25,288
and bring it to me.

181
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:29,588
If your deduction is the truth, you will make it to the second level

182
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:33,588
and as well as allowed to leave this island.

183
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:37,088
Which means that the battle has already been launched!

184
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:41,088
Then, is there a hidden camera somewhere?

185
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,488
But, how unexpected.

186
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,088
I thought that the first level was to see through

187
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:47,688
the fact that this person is a fake director.

188
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:50,488
Just what do you think you're saying? I'm really...

189
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,988
Quit playing dumb with us.

190
00:08:51,988 --> 00:08:56,488
Back then, when he said you went overboard,

191
00:08:56,488 --> 00:08:59,288
he meant you had a tough time because the shooting

192
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,288
took all the way till after midnight.

193
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:05,788
And the remark, "laugh" that the girl made after that

194
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:09,088
means do something about something.

195
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:11,088
I mean you're no new AD and all.

196
00:09:11,088 --> 00:09:15,488
There's no director that doesn't understand movie language like those.

197
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,488
Besides, that mark of Nichiuri TV that you have on you is strange.

198
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:20,888
The groove of the eye isn't right.

199
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:23,688
The real one grooves in the opposite direction.

200
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:28,088
That's why everyone figured you were a fake and tested you.

201
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:32,088
Well, you can explain after we make complete the first round though.

202
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:35,988
Sorry, but count me out.

203
00:09:35,988 --> 00:09:38,288
I've figured out

204
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:40,388
this locked room trick.

205
00:09:40,388 --> 00:09:43,188
Would you like me to show you?

206
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:44,888
You've already solved it.

207
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:47,488
Okay, show us.

208
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:49,088
No, you can't.

209
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:53,088
If you do so, the others will also figure out the trick.

210
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:54,788
So, please write your deduction down

211
00:09:54,788 --> 00:09:57,288
and bring it to me like I mentioned a while ago.

212
00:09:57,288 --> 00:10:01,188
This is the first round, you know, and not the finals.

213
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:04,788
Don't worry, he wouldn't do it right before our eyes.

214
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:06,688
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

215
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:10,088
the result would be the same even if this were to be the finals, though.

216
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:12,188
What confidence.

217
00:10:12,188 --> 00:10:14,688
I hope that trick isn't something that goes like,

218
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:18,588
Mr. Tsuchio who was tied up in the locked room,

219
00:10:18,588 --> 00:10:21,388
after locking the door tied himself up, is it?

220
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,588
No way,

221
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,088
because if so, the representative of the west

222
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:27,188
who untied him would've noticed,

223
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:30,488
no matter how incapable a detective he is.

224
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:32,488
How dare you call me incapable?

225
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:34,488
That's true, it wasn't smart.

226
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:36,888
You found blood on the door knob,

227
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:39,588
broke the door down and entered the room.

228
00:10:39,588 --> 00:10:40,788
In that case,

229
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:43,188
we should've checked things out by looking in from the window

230
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:45,188
and then decide whether we should break the door down

231
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:46,888
or crack the window and enter.

232
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:49,188
Because if Mr. Tsuchio was leaning against the door

233
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:51,288
or moreover, dead,

234
00:10:51,288 --> 00:10:53,888
at the point that the door is kicked open, the corpse would move,

235
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:56,588
as well as disperse the evidence.

236
00:10:56,588 --> 00:10:58,288
Stupid, back then...

237
00:10:58,288 --> 00:10:59,688
Overreaching and carrying things too far

238
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:02,888
for wanting to make it to scene before anyone else does.

239
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:05,788
Aren't such people considered disqualified as detectives?

240
00:11:05,788 --> 00:11:07,188
Watch your tongue!

241
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:09,488
He's not disqualified.

242
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:11,188
Kudo.

243
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:15,488
Heiji is just a bit too quick tempered.

244
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:16,788
Hey...

245
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:20,088
At any rate, I'm going back up to my room on the second floor

246
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:21,888
and turn my room into a locked room,

247
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:24,888
so wait for me while having dinner, will you?

248
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:26,988
It'll take me at least an hour to do so.

249
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:28,288
An hour?

250
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,888
I see, the time it took Mr. Koya to show us to our rooms,

251
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:34,288
to the time what happened at this room

252
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:36,088
took just about the same time.

253
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:38,488
The trick is an intricate one that requires that much time.

254
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:41,288
Well, I guess so.

255
00:11:41,288 --> 00:11:42,988
I'd like to say this, just in case, though.

256
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:46,088
This trick does not call for the foolish, uncouth detective's

257
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:47,288
ill-mannered actions,

258
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:48,688
so please keep that in mind.

259
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:52,388
Well, I'm sure that he won't repeat the same mistake again.

260
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,888
After all, he's got his local reputation as his father's name

261
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:57,388
as chief of Osaka Police Department to maintain too.

262
00:11:57,388 --> 00:12:00,788
Right, representative of the west?

263
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,488
But...

264
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:06,488
I like passionate detectives like you.

265
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:10,888
It's a ship

266
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:12,688
-that was anchored around here... -What's the matter, Kazuha?

267
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:16,188
-and took the children. -Well, I have this bad feeling.

268
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:18,188
The cell phone, it's still not going through?

269
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:19,788
-The number you have reached... -No,

270
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:21,388
it's still in the out of service area,

271
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:23,088
and just keeps repeating that message.

272
00:12:23,088 --> 00:12:24,388
I see.

273
00:12:24,388 --> 00:12:28,388
Hey, Ran, don't you feel something strange?

274
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:31,288
Like an unidentifiable eerie something

275
00:12:31,288 --> 00:12:33,888
is closing in on Heiji and the others.

276
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:35,488
I think you're letting your imagination get the better of you.

277
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:40,188
I'm sure that Heiji is okay and that he'll come back with Conan.

278
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:42,288
I know, but something bothers me.

279
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:45,288
The face of Heiji when he was being escorted off

280
00:12:45,288 --> 00:12:48,388
keep twirling around in my head over and over.

281
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:51,588
How about Conan's cell phone?

282
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:52,788
You still can't contact him?

283
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:55,188
Nope, his is no good either.

284
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:57,388
I wish that the representative of the east,

285
00:12:57,388 --> 00:12:58,888
Shinichi Kudo were there together with Heiji at a time like this.

286
00:12:58,888 --> 00:13:01,688
I would make me feel way better.

287
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:05,388
The number you have reached is out of service range...

288
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:08,288
It's the same with Shinichi's cell phone too.

289
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,588
Don't tell me that Shinichi is with them too?

290
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:32,027
"Purple. Scent of Lavender"

291
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:35,227
It's out of service range after all.

292
00:13:35,227 --> 00:13:38,027
Well, this is an isolated island.

293
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,827
What, no joke?

294
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,327
I just went to the restroom for a while

295
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:44,627
and yet there almost nothing left already.

296
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:46,727
Hey, mister, you're eating too much.

297
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:50,027
I know, I was starved, you see.

298
00:13:50,027 --> 00:13:51,527
Gosh.

299
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:53,927
Okay, so now that you're filled, tell us.

300
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:56,827
Won't you, fake TV director?

301
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:59,727
Tell us why you're participating as a fake TV director

302
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:01,627
for this Detective Championship Game.

303
00:14:01,627 --> 00:14:03,827
If this program is to measure our capabilities,

304
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:05,827
what's your role?

305
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:07,427
No. I can't tell you that

306
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:09,727
because if I do, I won't get paid. I bound by contract.

307
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:12,627
With Nichiuri TV?

308
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:16,027
Then, will you answer this question?

309
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:20,027
I was concerned since I set foot into this lodge

310
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,227
about the fragrance of the lavender flower over there.

311
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:26,327
Now that you mentioned it, there is a lavender flower in our room too.

312
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:27,427
Yeah.

313
00:14:27,427 --> 00:14:29,127
There's one in my room too.

314
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:31,627
It seems to be in every room.

315
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:35,527
And that toolbox that's sitting over there.

316
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:38,127
There's a meaning to it too, isn't there?

317
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,227
Well, I wonder.

318
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:43,627
It is the detective's job to figure that out.

319
00:14:43,627 --> 00:14:45,627
That's how I see it, is it not?

320
00:14:45,627 --> 00:14:49,627
True, but since we're separated from the outside world,

321
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:51,527
we don't have the means to check.

322
00:14:51,527 --> 00:14:54,627
Homicide at Lavender Manor.

323
00:14:57,627 --> 00:15:00,227
The only thing lavenders bring to my mind

324
00:15:00,227 --> 00:15:04,227
is the incident that occurred in Shikoku a year ago.

325
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:06,427
I've heard of that case too.

326
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:10,027
The one who was killed was the lady of the mansion.

327
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:25,127
Miss!

328
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:27,827
"Young Lady at the Lavender Manor Commits Suicide"

329
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:30,427
"Motive Unknown. The Door is Locked"

330
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:32,227
"Possibility of Intruder"

331
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:36,927
But it was found six months later that she had been murdered.

332
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:38,627
And? The killer?

333
00:15:38,627 --> 00:15:40,227
Committed suicide before getting caught.

334
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:42,327
That's what I heard.

335
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:47,727
What's up?

336
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:49,327
No, well, you see...

337
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:51,727
I forgot my cigarettes in my room.

338
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,727
Wow, it's really raining cats and dogs now.

339
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:06,227
What's the matter? You're drenched.

340
00:16:06,227 --> 00:16:09,427
Did you go look for a cigarette vending machine outside or something?

341
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,727
Oh, no, I just went to check how things were outside.

342
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:15,627
By the way, don't you think he's a bit too much time?

343
00:16:15,627 --> 00:16:18,827
Yes, it's been more than two hours since then already.

344
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:20,727
I'll go ask him

345
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:22,327
how much longer he thinks it will take him.

346
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:24,427
Okay, please do.

347
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:27,627
What? He's not in his room?

348
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:29,427
No, no matter how many times I knock on the door,

349
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:30,527
there's no answer.

350
00:16:30,527 --> 00:16:34,427
But, the door was locked, so maybe...

351
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,527
I see, he probably completed the locked room

352
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:39,827
and is watching from somewhere, snickering at us.

353
00:16:39,827 --> 00:16:42,627
If so, I'm sure he'd appear before us

354
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,727
with that boastful look of his.

355
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:47,627
I'll go check from outside, so wait here.

356
00:16:47,627 --> 00:16:49,527
Let me go with you!

357
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:52,727
It worries me to let you go alone.

358
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:54,327
Suit yourself.

359
00:17:00,027 --> 00:17:02,527
Come on. He's still there.

360
00:17:06,227 --> 00:17:08,727
He was smeared with blood, wasn't he?

361
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,527
Yeah. Let's hurry to the room.

362
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:15,827
You?

363
00:17:23,027 --> 00:17:24,627
Shoots.

364
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:28,527
How is it, Heiji?

365
00:17:30,027 --> 00:17:33,227
No good! He's really dead.

366
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:40,927
How are things?

367
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,027
Just as you can see,

368
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,327
he died on the spot after being hit on the head.

369
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:46,127
The murder weapon is probably that hammer.

370
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:48,027
It's got blood on it too.

371
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:50,127
It was probably taken from that toolbox

372
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:52,427
next to the lavender flowerpot.

373
00:17:52,427 --> 00:17:53,627
Were the windows locked?

374
00:17:53,627 --> 00:17:55,127
Yeah, they were,

375
00:17:55,127 --> 00:17:59,027
nice and tight until I opened them.

376
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:02,527
The window frame also seems to be tightly in place with a screw.

377
00:18:02,527 --> 00:18:07,127
The entrance door doesn't look to have been tampered with either.

378
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:11,127
Since there are no other escape holes or doors...

379
00:18:11,227 --> 00:18:12,927
It's a locked room murder.

380
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:14,627
Moreover, the killers are either

381
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,027
Ms. Koshimizu,

382
00:18:16,027 --> 00:18:19,227
Mr. Koya or Mr. Tsuchio, no?

383
00:18:19,227 --> 00:18:20,927
What? Brat!

384
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:22,627
Why us?

385
00:18:22,627 --> 00:18:24,027
True.

386
00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:25,327
After Tokitsu left the room saying that

387
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:29,027
he was going to turn his room on the second floor into a locked room,

388
00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:32,327
we began having dinner at the dining room downstairs.

389
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:36,327
I left to go to the restroom, and wasn't there for about ten minutes.

390
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:38,627
A few minutes after I returned,

391
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:41,627
Mr. Tsuchio went to his room to get his cigarettes

392
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:44,727
and Mr. Koya went to check on Tokitsu.

393
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:49,027
If all during that time, Hakuba and you two were together,

394
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,727
it would be most plausible.

395
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:54,227
Hold it, I was only hired to come here.

396
00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:55,227
By who?

397
00:18:55,227 --> 00:18:57,527
The TV station would never plan a program like this

398
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:59,427
where somebody would actually die, would they?

399
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:00,827
I really thought it was a program

400
00:19:00,827 --> 00:19:02,327
that the TV station had planned to do.

401
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:04,727
I'm an actor and I belong to an acting school.

402
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:10,427
I received a letter asking to act the role of a TV director.

403
00:19:10,427 --> 00:19:12,127
I was told I'd be given an advance payment of 500,000 yen,

404
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:13,527
and if the fact that I'm a fake is not revealed,

405
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,227
I was supposed to have received another 500,000 yen.

406
00:19:15,227 --> 00:19:17,427
It's a great job that anybody would jump at, isn't it?

407
00:19:17,427 --> 00:19:18,727
And, now that everything's out in the light?

408
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:23,927
Even so, if I just go through with the game,

409
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:26,727
I was told I'd be given half the pay, that's 250,000 yen.

410
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:30,627
Then, why did you go to your room to get your cigarette,

411
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,627
and yet go outside and get drenched in the rain?

412
00:19:34,827 --> 00:19:36,727
I wanted to use the wireless radio that's in the shed

413
00:19:36,727 --> 00:19:38,427
to make emergency contact.

414
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,427
But...

415
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:41,327
it was destroyed!

416
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:43,127
When I came to check the place out three days ago,

417
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:45,327
it was just fine.

418
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:47,127
-Honestly? -Yeah.

419
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:49,127
But, how strange.

420
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:53,027
You headed for the shed before this murder was committed.

421
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:56,727
How did you know that this sort of emergency was going to happen?

422
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:59,327
I just had a premonition.

423
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:01,627
Honestly.

424
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:06,027
Then, Mr. Koya, were also called by Mr. Tsuchio?

425
00:20:06,027 --> 00:20:09,927
Yes, I came here two days ago to look after all of you.

426
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:12,727
I just happened to get time off

427
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:15,627
from the household that I serve as steward so.

428
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:18,627
But, you already knew the answer to the locked room murder, right?

429
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:20,827
Because you told us to write the answer down and take it to you.

430
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:23,727
I was told to say so if something happened in the locked room.

431
00:20:23,727 --> 00:20:25,827
The order went on to say to sneak the answer sheet

432
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:28,327
under the toilet mat.

433
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,227
That's a clever way to put it.

434
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:32,827
As if there's someone else pulling the strings behind the scene.

435
00:20:32,827 --> 00:20:34,727
No, I'm telling the truth.

436
00:20:34,727 --> 00:20:38,127
Whatever the story, I'm in the same boat as you all are.

437
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:41,027
I was just told to come here as a high school detective

438
00:20:41,027 --> 00:20:44,627
representing the south by that fake TV director.

439
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:49,027
I hate thunder!

440
00:20:49,027 --> 00:20:51,527
So, please close the window, quick, please.

441
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:53,027
Yeah.

442
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,127
Don't worry. I'll silence the thunder

443
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:58,027
as well as the case soon.

444
00:20:58,027 --> 00:20:59,927
What's with him?

445
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:07,827
At any rate, we three will check the place

446
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:10,327
so you three suspects wait in the first floor dining room

447
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:12,827
-till it's done. -If I could have my way,

448
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:16,527
I would like you to do likewise and wait with them too.

449
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,427
You're much too hot-tempered,

450
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:19,727
or should I say reckless?

451
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:21,327
What?

452
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:24,227
Look at the shattered pieces of glass!

453
00:21:24,227 --> 00:21:27,527
And the footprints of your muddy shoes left on the desk!

454
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:29,727
What a dreadful sight!

455
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:32,227
Don't tell me that you opened the lock with your bare hands too.

456
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:33,827
Yeah, I opened it!

457
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:35,027
Bug you!

458
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,627
He's venting his anger out on the wrong person.

459
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:39,327
You really disappoint me.

460
00:21:39,327 --> 00:21:40,527
From what my father told me about you,

461
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:43,327
I thought you were way more capable.

462
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:45,927
After taking them to the dining room,

463
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:48,227
we'll be resuming investigation

464
00:21:48,227 --> 00:21:50,527
but please try not to get in the way,

465
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:52,627
representative of the west, okay?

466
00:21:54,127 --> 00:21:58,427
Hey, Kudo. Am I wrong?

467
00:21:58,427 --> 00:22:01,027
No. Not at all.

468
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:03,227
Not at all?

469
00:22:03,227 --> 00:22:04,427
I'm referring to a ship that a man with a mustache,

470
00:22:04,427 --> 00:22:08,227
three high school students and a child boarded!

471
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:12,227
There's no way you couldn't have seen them at all, right?

472
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:13,827
What's the matter, Kazuha?

473
00:22:13,827 --> 00:22:17,227
Something bothers me after all

474
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:18,827
about the look on Heiji's face back then.

475
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:20,327
Okay, I'll leave behind a message saying,

476
00:22:20,327 --> 00:22:23,827
"Heiji Hattori was here!"

477
00:22:23,827 --> 00:22:27,027
Heiji was here?

478
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:32,127
Ran, when Heiji said, "He was here..."

479
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:34,127
Could he have meant...
