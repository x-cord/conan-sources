1
00:00:01,055 --> 00:00:05,054
The news of Ryusuke Higo and Idol Yoko Okino

2
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:08,154
being passionately in love with each other is publicized.

3
00:00:08,155 --> 00:00:11,454
Ai and Kogoro who cannot believe this,

4
00:00:11,455 --> 00:00:13,454
go after the two.

5
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:17,754
They discover the two at a restaurant in Haidocho.

6
00:00:17,755 --> 00:00:20,554
It seems that the two came to visit their friend

7
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:25,355
as well as their senior in High School, Mr. Teiya Asuka.

8
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:30,055
That was Yoko's scream!

9
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:32,655
Yoko!

10
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:39,154
Hey, Mr. Asuka?

11
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:40,954
Get a hold of yourself! Hey!

12
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:42,454
Mr. Asuka?

13
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:44,454
Mr. Asuka!

14
00:00:44,455 --> 00:00:46,954
When you searched the storeroom,

15
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:49,254
you didn't see the owner there?

16
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:50,255
No.

17
00:00:50,256 --> 00:00:54,554
But the next time, I was told to search the back room

18
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:58,454
so I went back about 10 minutes later.

19
00:00:58,455 --> 00:01:01,654
Then, I found the owner there.

20
00:01:01,655 --> 00:01:03,554
-You found the owner? -Yes.

21
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:07,254
He was sleeping on the sofa with a blanket over his head.

22
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:10,955
His shoes were placed near the sofa too, so I'm sure!

23
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:13,954
And, what's after that?

24
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:15,754
After she told me this,

25
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:18,854
I went to wake him up about 10 minutes later.

26
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:21,254
Back then, he wasn't asleep on the sofa.

27
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:24,854
Just about that time, I got an e-mail from the owner

28
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:27,354
telling me if I could bring Mr, Higo and Yoko to the storeroom

29
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:29,354
without being noticed by anyone.

30
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,354
About what time was it?

31
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:33,954
About 7:30 p.m.

32
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:37,954
That's why I brought those two to the storeroom, you see.

33
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:40,254
I called him just before going into the storeroom,

34
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:41,854
but there was no answer.

35
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:43,354
Since he didn't come out,

36
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:45,854
I thought he went back to the back room.

37
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,154
I left the two at the storeroom and went to the back room,

38
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:51,154
but only Mr. Yamada was there.

39
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:54,854
When all three of us were wondering where the owner went...

40
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:57,354
We heard Yoko scream.

41
00:01:57,355 --> 00:01:59,354
Although there are 5 suspects,

42
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:01,155
the suspicious ones are those three.

43
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:07,955
How on earth did the perp commit the crime?

44
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:12,454
A canvas stained black with crime.

45
00:02:12,455 --> 00:02:15,154
Vivid brilliant deduction skills changes its color!

46
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:17,154
The truth of the case and couple is ambiguous.

47
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:19,254
What happened in the back room?

48
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:20,954
He sees through the one and only truth.

49
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:22,754
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

50
00:02:22,755 --> 00:02:25,255
His name is Detective Conan!

51
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:08,564
"The Suspects are Passionate Lovers (Part 2)"

52
00:04:10,264 --> 00:04:11,264
And?

53
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:15,363
Just what do you intend to do to Yoko?

54
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:17,463
What... what am I intending to do?

55
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:21,263
That's not my question.

56
00:04:21,264 --> 00:04:24,763
When you two entered the storeroom where you found the corpse,

57
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,263
was the door really locked?

58
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:30,563
Yes, I'm sure the waiter unlocked it.

59
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:33,563
Then, after calling Mr. Asuka several times,

60
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,963
he told us to wait there and left.

61
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:38,463
He didn't come back for a while.

62
00:04:38,464 --> 00:04:40,963
In the storeroom, we saw a lot of things from abroad,

63
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:43,963
like canned goods and such that we never saw before,

64
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:46,263
so we were looking around.

65
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:47,763
Then we noticed

66
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:51,663
something that looked like blood on the floor beyond.

67
00:04:51,664 --> 00:04:53,863
So we went to check on it.

68
00:04:53,864 --> 00:04:59,663
Then we found Mr. Asuka dead.

69
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:01,763
I see.

70
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:03,963
By the way, Mr. Higo,

71
00:05:03,964 --> 00:05:07,263
you mentioned that you lost your cell phone,

72
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:10,163
but do you have any idea where you could've lost it?

73
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:15,263
No. I seem to forget it on the table of restaurants that I go to.

74
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:16,463
Come to think of it,

75
00:05:16,464 --> 00:05:20,463
the waitress spilled wine and changed the tablecloth.

76
00:05:20,464 --> 00:05:23,063
It could be in the restroom, too.

77
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:25,863
Because I usually keep it in my pocket together with my handkerchief.

78
00:05:25,864 --> 00:05:27,463
When I take out my handkerchief,

79
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:30,663
I forget to put my cell phone back.

80
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,363
Haven't you experienced similar cases?

81
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:33,663
Yes, I guess.

82
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:35,563
Yes! I do, I do!

83
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:37,463
I often forget my cell phone, too.

84
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:39,164
You never forget it.

85
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:43,563
So, while you were in the restaurant,

86
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:45,263
you couldn't make contact with the owner?

87
00:05:45,264 --> 00:05:46,264
No.

88
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:49,463
But you could've borrowed Yoko's cell phone.

89
00:05:49,464 --> 00:05:53,263
The thing is... I brought my cell phone,

90
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:56,763
but I forgot to charge it last night before going to bed.

91
00:05:56,764 --> 00:05:59,863
When it came time to call him, the battery was dead.

92
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:02,463
Things like this happen, right?

93
00:06:02,464 --> 00:06:04,563
-Never! -What?

94
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,363
They do happen.

95
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:08,863
They do happen, Yoko.

96
00:06:08,864 --> 00:06:11,463
Okay.

97
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:16,963
And what favor did you come to ask the victim today?

98
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:18,463
-Well... -That's...

99
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:20,363
What?

100
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:23,663
This blanket is the one that Mr. Asuka was using

101
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:24,863
when he was asleep, right?

102
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:26,563
It should be.

103
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:29,063
Is something the matter, Conan?

104
00:06:29,064 --> 00:06:30,263
Right over here.

105
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:34,963
There's a tiny hole and a reddish black stain is around it.

106
00:06:34,964 --> 00:06:35,964
What?

107
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:39,763
Hey! Don't tell me that it's blood?

108
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:42,963
Nope, because it smells like wine.

109
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:44,463
Seriously.

110
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:46,463
Stop surprising me like that.

111
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:49,263
But, how did it get here?

112
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:51,863
The smell is clear,

113
00:06:51,864 --> 00:06:54,563
so not much time has passed since it got here.

114
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:56,763
At most, it was probably just a few hours ago at the most.

115
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:58,664
Which means, he could've gotten involved in an incident.

116
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:02,263
Even after I cleaned the place thoroughly,

117
00:07:02,264 --> 00:07:04,163
I could hear the sound of the vacuum cleaner.

118
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:07,563
He was sleeping on the sofa with a blanket over his head.

119
00:07:07,564 --> 00:07:09,363
But when we came here the first time,

120
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:11,663
the only thing here was the blanket

121
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,363
and there was no one here.

122
00:07:13,364 --> 00:07:14,463
-Hey! -I see.

123
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:16,364
-Are you listening to me? -Which means that maybe...

124
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:20,163
In here.

125
00:07:20,164 --> 00:07:22,563
Found it. There's a hole.

126
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:26,063
Moreover, there is a slight bit of wine stain on this, too.

127
00:07:26,064 --> 00:07:29,463
-Hey, Conan, don't! -It's just as I thought.

128
00:07:29,464 --> 00:07:34,264
He established an alibi in an instant

129
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:39,764
by cleverly using those convenient items.

130
00:07:43,164 --> 00:07:46,563
So, summarizing what you all said,

131
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:48,263
since the owner of this restaurant,

132
00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:50,963
Mr. Teiya Asuka was late coming back,

133
00:07:50,964 --> 00:07:52,763
sommelier Mr. Yamada,

134
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:58,363
waiter Mr. Konoe and waitress Ms. Banba decided to look for him.

135
00:07:58,364 --> 00:08:01,763
Mr. Yamada and Mr. Konoe came to search

136
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:04,763
this back room where the staff takes breaks,

137
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:07,263
but the owner was nowhere in sight.

138
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:09,463
Although Ms. Banba went to look for him in the basement storeroom,

139
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:11,463
he wasn't there either.

140
00:08:11,464 --> 00:08:12,663
That's right.

141
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:14,563
Then, ten minutes later,

142
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:18,163
the three of you decided to search for the owner again.

143
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,463
This time, Mr. Yamada searched the storeroom,

144
00:08:20,464 --> 00:08:22,263
Mr. Konoe searched the restroom,

145
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:24,563
and Ms. Banba searched the back room.

146
00:08:24,564 --> 00:08:28,063
And it was then that you found the owner asleep on the sofa

147
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:32,363
with the blanket over his head, correct, Ms. Banba?

148
00:08:32,364 --> 00:08:35,863
Yes. I couldn't see his head since it was covered with the blanket,

149
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:39,563
but his shoes were by the sofa, too.

150
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:41,263
And then 10 minutes after that,

151
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:45,863
Mr. Yamada came to the back room again

152
00:08:45,864 --> 00:08:49,663
but the owner was no longer under the blanket and missing.

153
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:50,863
Just about the same time,

154
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:54,263
Mr. Konoe receives an e-mail on his cell phone from the owner

155
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:57,563
telling him to bring Mr. Higo and Yoko to the storeroom

156
00:08:57,564 --> 00:09:00,163
without anyone noticing.

157
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,763
So, Mr. Konoe escorts the two to the storeroom

158
00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:06,163
and calls out to the owner but gets no answer.

159
00:09:06,164 --> 00:09:07,663
Therefore, he leaves the two at the storeroom

160
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:10,663
and goes off to search for the owner.

161
00:09:10,664 --> 00:09:13,363
After that, you two who were waiting at the storeroom,

162
00:09:13,364 --> 00:09:15,663
discovers the owner's dead body.

163
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:17,263
Is that correct?

164
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:18,864
-Yes. -Yes.

165
00:09:19,864 --> 00:09:23,563
The back room and the storeroom are always locked.

166
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,163
The keys are hanging at the entrance of the corridor,

167
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:28,263
in clear view of the staff,

168
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:30,663
and are to be left on the premises.

169
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:33,363
And the only one who has the spare keys is the owner.

170
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:37,963
Moreover, when Mr. Konoe took Mr. Higo and Yoko to the storeroom,

171
00:09:37,964 --> 00:09:41,663
if the door of the storeroom was properly locked...

172
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,063
The only ones left, capable of committing the crime

173
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:48,363
are the two who were waiting in the storeroom, Mr. Higo and Yoko.

174
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:52,263
-What? -Wait... wait, Inspector!

175
00:09:52,264 --> 00:09:54,563
I don't know about that soccer guy.

176
00:09:54,564 --> 00:09:58,663
But such a lovely girl like Yoko would never commit murder!

177
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,463
But considering the circumstances...

178
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:05,763
So, the owner who was actually a big fan of Yoko,

179
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:08,563
hid in the storeroom waiting for her to be alone,

180
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:10,163
so he could attack her.

181
00:10:10,164 --> 00:10:12,463
But the soccer guy was still there.

182
00:10:12,464 --> 00:10:14,463
They got into a fight and he killed him!

183
00:10:14,464 --> 00:10:19,163
Yoko's only protecting the soccer guy because she's kind!

184
00:10:19,164 --> 00:10:22,563
That means she's helping a criminal avoid arrest.

185
00:10:22,564 --> 00:10:25,564
Please overlook that part for her, will you?

186
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:30,063
Mr. Mouri?

187
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:32,364
Please pour more wine for me.

188
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:37,363
Don't tell me you really believed that I'd say something like that?

189
00:10:37,364 --> 00:10:40,564
It's harder for me to believe that attitude of yours.

190
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:44,563
Don't you think it's strange?

191
00:10:44,564 --> 00:10:45,963
What is?

192
00:10:45,964 --> 00:10:49,763
The number of people who initially searched this back room.

193
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:52,063
-What? -In a room like this,

194
00:10:52,064 --> 00:10:55,363
you can tell at first glance whether someone here or not.

195
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:59,763
Yet, Mr. Yamada and Mr. Konoe both searched this room.

196
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:03,363
The storeroom on the other hand has lots of shelves and blind spots,

197
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:06,363
so more people could've been sent over to search it,

198
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:09,963
but Ms. Banba went there alone.

199
00:11:09,964 --> 00:11:12,263
It sure is strange.

200
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:14,863
Why did they do something like that...

201
00:11:14,864 --> 00:11:20,663
It was because they wanted a third party to confirm

202
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:23,563
that the owner was not in this room.

203
00:11:23,564 --> 00:11:25,964
In order to complete the murder trick!

204
00:11:34,766 --> 00:11:37,765
Why did they do something like that...

205
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:43,265
It was because they wanted a third party to confirm

206
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:46,065
that the owner was not in this room.

207
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:49,365
In order to complete the murder trick!

208
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:50,965
Which means...

209
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:53,165
Mr. Yamada, Mr. Konoe,

210
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,665
one of you is the killer.

211
00:11:55,666 --> 00:12:00,265
Mr. Yamada's the one who said we should search the room together.

212
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:02,565
Right?

213
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:05,965
Yes, I did say so, indeed.

214
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:10,465
Because there are lockers and cabinets in this room!

215
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:14,565
Did you think that the owner would be hiding in places like that?

216
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:17,265
You never know, right?

217
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:22,065
Besides, why should I have to make him confirm that the owner isn't here?

218
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:25,865
Back then, we were here only for a matter of minutes, you know?

219
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:28,565
No, it wasn't for a matter of minutes.

220
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:30,765
Just an instant.

221
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:35,065
Back then, you set it up in an instant.

222
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:38,465
The image of the ownerleeping sleeping on the couch

223
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,365
with a blanket over his head!

224
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:42,365
Don't be ridiculous!

225
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:47,165
Are you saying that I stuck something inside the blanket back then?

226
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,365
I didn't do anything of that sort, did I?

227
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:52,165
No. Besides, there was nothing near the sofa

228
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,065
to do something like that in the first place.

229
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,465
I bought what you asked for, Mr. Mouri!

230
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:59,165
A blanket, an ice pick, a vacuum bag,

231
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,165
and five sets of heavy clothing!

232
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:05,065
But what are you going to do with these items?

233
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:07,065
Okay, let's start the experiment!

234
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:10,565
Hey, Conan! Do exactly as I told you to.

235
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:12,366
Yep, I got it!

236
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:20,265
First, you put the clothes into the vacuum bag.

237
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,065
Then use a vacuum cleaner to remove the air from inside the bag

238
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:24,665
and flatten it.

239
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,165
I see. So that's what the owner was doing

240
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,965
when I heard him using the vacuum cleaner.

241
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:34,365
Put the vacuum bag with the clothes inside on the sofa.

242
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:37,665
Then put the blanket over it, and it's ready!

243
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:42,865
See? This way it just looks like there's a blanket on the sofa, right?

244
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:43,965
Yeah.

245
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:47,965
But, if you stab it with the ice pick,

246
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:49,866
so it reaches the very bottom, like this.

247
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:55,765
Air begins entering the bag from the hole and...

248
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:59,465
See! Now it looks like someone is sleeping under it, right?

249
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:01,165
Right!

250
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,165
Then, you just have to pull the owner's shoes

251
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:09,165
that were hidden under the sofa out like this, and all done!

252
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,365
He would've had enough time to do all this just before leaving the room

253
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:15,165
without Mr. Konoe noticing, right?

254
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:19,865
But Mr. Konoe could've pulled the trick off as well.

255
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:21,665
-What? -No.

256
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,565
You're the one who did it, Mr. Yamada.

257
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:25,965
Why? Because...

258
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:30,265
The blanket in this room had a small hole

259
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:34,165
with a wine stain around it.

260
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,265
In other words, it's proof that you used it

261
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:39,965
when opening a hole in the vacuum bag.

262
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,965
An essential tool for a sommelier,

263
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:44,965
the sommelier's knife!

264
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:46,565
You poked the blanket

265
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:49,165
with the tip of the corkscrew of your sommelier's knife

266
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,265
that you use to open wine bottles.

267
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,065
That's why there were wine stains

268
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:58,665
around the hole of the blanket and clothes.

269
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,765
Wait a minute, Mr. Mouri.

270
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,765
According to a sommelier friend of mine,

271
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:08,665
he said that he doesn't pierce the cork all the way.

272
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:12,865
Because otherwise, pieces of cork will fall into the wine.

273
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:16,865
In the case of the old corks of super expensive aged wine,

274
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:19,265
he told me that there are times he pierces the cork right through.

275
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:22,065
But I wonder if there's such wine in this restaurant.

276
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:23,265
No, there aren't!

277
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:25,865
We're not a three-star restaurant, you know!

278
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:29,165
That's why I'm saying somebody did this to frame me.

279
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,265
That's true.

280
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:33,265
Normally, there is no blood stain

281
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,765
on the corkscrew of the sommelier's knife.

282
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:40,666
That is, if you, Mr. Yamada is a real sommelier!

283
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:47,565
After you uncorked the wine at Mr. Higo and Yoko's table,

284
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:51,965
you put that cork on the table without sniffing it, correct?

285
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:54,766
A sommelier would never do that.

286
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:57,465
Known as bouchonne,

287
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:59,065
about one in every ten or twenty wines,

288
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:01,065
because of the remains of cleansing fluid

289
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:02,865
used in the process of making cork,

290
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:07,565
the wine is degraded and smells of cork.

291
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,765
Why did you fail to confirm this?

292
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:13,865
Besides, you smoke cigarettes.

293
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:16,365
A sommelier who values the sense of taste,

294
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:18,066
would never smoke.

295
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:22,465
The load of cigarette butts that were found in the men's room

296
00:16:22,466 --> 00:16:24,565
was of the same brand,

297
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,265
but some were long and the filters were chewed on,

298
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:32,865
while others were smoked down to the end and then snuffed out.

299
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:36,365
In other words, the cigarette butts were of two different men.

300
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:38,865
Judging from the amount of cigarettes,

301
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:41,165
they were not of the customers but of the staff of this restaurant.

302
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,265
Mr. Konoe probably smoked half of them,

303
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:47,065
while Mr. Yamada smoked the other half.

304
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:51,765
Examination of the saliva on the filters will easily reveal

305
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:54,366
that you're a fake sommelier!

306
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,965
The cell phone that Mr. Higo forgot in the men's room

307
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:02,565
was what triggered you to commit the crime.

308
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:03,866
Correct?

309
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,665
Reading the mail on his cell,

310
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,865
you found out that Mr. Higo and Yoko

311
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:12,665
were coming here today to meet the owner.

312
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,065
Therefore, you thought about committing this crime,

313
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:17,065
took out about 5 sets of clothes that were vacuum packed

314
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:19,065
in the owner's locker in the back room,

315
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:23,565
put them on the sofa and put a blanket over them.

316
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:27,065
You probably sent the owner a mail

317
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:29,865
asking him to buy some additional items to delay his return

318
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:31,065
so the other staff members

319
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:33,965
would suggest looking for him because he was late.

320
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:37,365
And of course, it turned out as you planned.

321
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:40,565
First, you decided to search the back room together with Mr. Konoe,

322
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:43,465
and after making him see that the owner wasn't there.

323
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:45,065
On your way out,

324
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:48,865
you opened a hole in the vacuum bag, inflated the blanket

325
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:52,065
and took the owner's shoes out from under the sofa.

326
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:55,065
Then you sent mail out from Mr. Higo's phone

327
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:56,565
saying that you wanted to meet him in private

328
00:17:56,566 --> 00:18:00,565
so to wait for him in the storeroom.

329
00:18:00,566 --> 00:18:02,665
You then pretended to search for the owner once again

330
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,365
and went to the storeroom where you killed him.

331
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:06,565
You tricked Ms. Banba and Mr. Konoe

332
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:08,665
into thinking that the owner was in the back room,

333
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,065
asleep on the sofa with a blanket over his head,

334
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:15,565
and went back there 10 minutes later to wake the owner.

335
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:17,865
And while doing so,

336
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:20,065
you sent mail to Mr. Konoe from the phone of the owner

337
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,365
that you took when you killed him,

338
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,965
telling him to take Mr. Higo and Yoko to the storeroom.

339
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:25,465
You went back to the back room,

340
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:28,365
took the clothes out of the vacuum bag that was left on the sofa,

341
00:18:28,366 --> 00:18:30,965
put them back into the owner's locker

342
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:34,665
and hid all proof of the crime.

343
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,365
Isn't that right?

344
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,365
Proof.

345
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:42,565
Where on earth are the vacuum bag and cell phones then?

346
00:18:42,566 --> 00:18:44,666
Inside the trash box in the kitchen!

347
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,965
I just found them

348
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:51,466
and the forensics are checking them out now!

349
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:55,165
You probably went into the kitchen

350
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,165
during the commotion when the owner's body was found

351
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,165
and dumped the vacuum bag and cell phones you had in your pocket

352
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,465
into the trash box.

353
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:05,765
You didn't have time to wear gloves,

354
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:08,865
so I'm sure your fingerprints are all over them.

355
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:11,465
So, give yourself up!

356
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,766
You killed him, didn't you?

357
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:21,565
I... I had no choice

358
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:25,165
because the owner found out.

359
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,865
That I was sticking fake labels on cheap wine,

360
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:31,465
selling them as expensive wine.

361
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:32,865
The profits went into the business,

362
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:36,065
and I even gave kickbacks to the wine dealers.

363
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:37,765
I told him straight

364
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:41,465
that customers who come to a former J-Leaguer's restaurant are not experts,

365
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:43,865
and know nothing about the taste of wine,

366
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:48,065
so let's make money this way and enlarge the shop!

367
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:51,565
But the owner wouldn't listen.

368
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:56,165
Moreover, he declared that he'd turn me in for fraud.

369
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,666
That's only natural.

370
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:01,365
Mr. Asuka, used to be a famed player,

371
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:07,366
who always played fair and square and never once received a red card.

372
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:48,666
And? What favor did you want to ask the victim?

373
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:53,265
One of our teachers from the high school

374
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:58,065
that Mr. Asuka, Yoko and I used to attend is retiring.

375
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,365
So, we went to choose a wristwatch

376
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:03,565
to give him as a gift for his retirement

377
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:05,665
and was hoping that Mr. Asuka would also

378
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,665
write a celebratory message to him.

379
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,865
After all, Mr. Asuka's the first celebrity

380
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:13,065
out of Konan High School, you see.

381
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:15,965
Why didn't you say so in the beginning then?

382
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:17,365
We tried to say so.

383
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:19,865
But we were interrupted each time.

384
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:21,165
It's me.

385
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:24,565
Which means you two aren't going with each other?

386
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:28,065
No. Because my love is soccer and it will be for some time yet.

387
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:30,565
Mine are singing and acting!

388
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:33,965
I see. I wish you both luck in whatever you do!

389
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:35,165
-Thank you! -Thank you!

390
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:39,165
At any rate, I'm sorry for all the worry we caused you.

391
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,465
And Mr. Mouri,

392
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:44,065
thank you for pointing out the perp who did what he did to Mr. Asuka.

393
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:48,666
And Conan, thank you for helping out with the deduction!

394
00:22:49,966 --> 00:22:52,565
And you.

395
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:55,465
Thank you for finding the evidence for us!

396
00:22:55,466 --> 00:22:57,566
Nice assist!

397
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:03,365
I wish you could play on our team in place of Takahiro.

398
00:23:03,366 --> 00:23:05,066
Thank you, Ai!

399
00:23:18,366 --> 00:23:19,765
Hey, what're you doing?

400
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,165
Let's hurry to the park and play soccer!

401
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,865
-What? -No joke?

402
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:26,165
It looks like it's going to rain, though.

403
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,565
No matter how hard you try,

404
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:30,566
girls are never going to make it into Mr. Higo's team.

405
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:39,266
That's Yoko's song!

406
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,865
"Next Episode"

407
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:44,865
So many toys!

408
00:23:44,866 --> 00:23:47,165
Are just you two living here?

409
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:51,465
Yeah! We love toys and get along really well!

410
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:52,565
Right?

411
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:54,166
Toys are fantastic!

412
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:58,366
Somebody help!

413
00:24:00,866 --> 00:24:01,965
Shoots.

414
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:04,566
My shoe and tranquilizer gun are going through maintenance now!

415
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:11,066
