1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:03,622
On the second day of his Meijin title match,

2
00:00:03,623 --> 00:00:07,222
Shukichi Haneda, also known as Sextuple Crown "Taiko Meijin",

3
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:11,022
receives a letter before the match.

4
00:00:11,023 --> 00:00:15,322
Inside, he finds a code and photo of his girlfriend,

5
00:00:15,323 --> 00:00:17,723
Assistant Inspector Yumi Miyamoto.

6
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:23,322
Haneda, in order to save Yumi, he leaves the match

7
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,922
and heads for the shrine indicated in the code.

8
00:00:25,923 --> 00:00:28,222
There, he meets us and the members of the Youth Detective Squad

9
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:31,222
that happen to be touring power spots.

10
00:00:31,223 --> 00:00:35,022
We decide to join hands and rescue Yumi.

11
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:38,822
So, it's check. Shukichi Haneda.

12
00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:42,122
You've got no choice but to take my promoted pawn.

13
00:00:42,123 --> 00:00:46,722
If you do, my captured rook

14
00:00:46,723 --> 00:00:48,222
will shatter your offense

15
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:50,522
and your tactical formation will totally collapse.

16
00:00:50,523 --> 00:00:53,023
My victory is definite.

17
00:00:56,323 --> 00:01:00,223
"3 hours and 4 minutes left for Shukichi Haneda."

18
00:01:03,223 --> 00:01:05,022
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

19
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,722
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

20
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:09,522
Coded letters of scenic beauty sites and historic interest.

21
00:01:09,523 --> 00:01:11,522
Solve them all and checkmate the case!

22
00:01:11,523 --> 00:01:13,122
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:14,922
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:14,923 --> 00:01:17,123
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:02:55,906 --> 00:03:01,061
"Taiko Meijin's Match of Love (Part 2)"

26
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:07,480
Yuureizaka? (Ghost Hill)

27
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,980
Why did they put such a terrifying name on it?

28
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:13,780
I heard it's because it's a desolate hill

29
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:16,880
lined with temples on both sides.

30
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:19,680
It's written on the side of the sign post, isn't it?

31
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:20,880
Oh, yeah!

32
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:25,380
Oh, I thought it was a hill leading to hell.

33
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:29,180
Well, our destination is a graveyard half way through this hill though.

34
00:03:29,181 --> 00:03:30,580
What?

35
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:33,180
Right, Taiko Meijin?

36
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:34,380
Yeah.

37
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:39,280
The code found at Kiyomasa's well was found on a lance piece.

38
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:40,281
In other words,

39
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:43,980
the code numbers seven and three stands for lances or spears.

40
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:47,280
Kiyomasa Kato, the spear and seven

41
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:49,780
bring to mind the seven generals known as the "Seven Spears"

42
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:53,380
that led the forces to victory at the Battle of Shizugatale.

43
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:57,780
In addition, the three lances refer to the "Three Great Spears of Japan".

44
00:03:57,781 --> 00:04:01,280
Otogine, Hinomotogo, and Tonbogiri.

45
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:05,080
The man who was one of the Seven Spears,

46
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:08,280
owned one of the Three Great Spears.

47
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,380
He was Masanori Fukushima,

48
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:12,880
who received the Hinomotogo from Hideyoshi Toyotomi.

49
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:13,980
Right.

50
00:04:13,981 --> 00:04:17,280
While drinking with Kanbei Kuroda's retainer,

51
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:20,080
he won that spear in a bet.

52
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:21,081
Yes.

53
00:04:21,082 --> 00:04:25,680
The upside-down T piercing the overlapping circles of seven

54
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:30,280
and three is the cartographic symbol for graveyards.

55
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:31,480
I see.

56
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,980
So the grave of Masanori Fukushima is up ahead, right?

57
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:36,880
Yeah.

58
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:39,180
-You have no idea, though? -What?

59
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:41,980
Of who kidnapped Yumi.

60
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,080
Since he calls himself the Headless Knight,

61
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:46,280
I'm sure he has some connection with shogi.

62
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:49,180
No. Nothing in particular.

63
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:52,281
Don't tell me...

64
00:04:54,181 --> 00:04:57,780
4-8 rook! 4-8 rook!

65
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:00,280
This move will fork his king and silver general.

66
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,880
And I'll win!

67
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:04,980
Quick take my promoted pawn!

68
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:08,480
Let me play this winning move!

69
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:11,080
My wife is waiting in the hospital.

70
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:14,480
She's waiting to hear news of my victory.

71
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,380
That I'll be acquiring rank B.

72
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:19,381
That I'll be able to move her to a better hospital.

73
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:24,280
Yes...

74
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:26,080
The victorious 4-8 rook!

75
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:27,580
Wait!

76
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:31,581
There's no waiting in shogi!

77
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:36,580
Why is my promoted pawn still there?

78
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,180
What was that sound just now?

79
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:39,680
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:41,780
I was playing with the piece while thinking,

81
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:43,480
and the piece sounded.

82
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:45,980
What?

83
00:05:45,981 --> 00:05:49,080
But taking two turns is against the rules.

84
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:50,981
Please give up the game for lost.

85
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:56,381
A post-match discussion won't be necessary, will it?

86
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:03,980
That foul player is a Sextuple crown?

87
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:05,780
You got to be joking!

88
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:07,180
After that,

89
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:09,680
I was so bewildered that I didn't get to see my wife when she died.

90
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:12,980
I was unable to play shogi and hit rock bottom.

91
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:18,981
Come. Let's replay that match, Shukichi Haneda!

92
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:24,481
That is if you can make it here.

93
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:31,180
This is a strange looking grave.

94
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:33,480
More accurately put, it's a memorial tower.

95
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:37,280
The small one next to it is his son, Masatoshi's grave.

96
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:39,380
But there's nothing here.

97
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:40,980
If this is a memorial tower,

98
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:43,580
the real grave maybe is somewhere else?

99
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:47,080
Yeah. There seem to be graves in Nagano, Kyoto, Wakayama.

100
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:49,480
And Hiroshima too.

101
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:52,580
I figured that after making him go to Meiji Shrine in Tokyo,

102
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:56,981
there would not be enough time to make him go to other prefectures, so...

103
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:00,680
There' s something behind the grave!

104
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:03,380
It's a shogi board!

105
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,080
There.

106
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:08,080
Here goes!

107
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:10,280
I'm finished taking a bath.

108
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:12,781
You fell asleep?

109
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:16,681
The TV remote controller?

110
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:23,581
Shogi?

111
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:30,080
The pieces are stuck onto the shogi board.

112
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:32,380
But why are they nailed on?

113
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:37,280
I think it means to come to where the nails are hammered down.

114
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,780
Is this some sort of strategy?

115
00:07:39,781 --> 00:07:43,480
No, I don't recall such a formation.

116
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:48,080
The thing that concerns me is the bishop which is nailed to the rook,

117
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:50,880
and likewise, the overlapping gold and silver generals.

118
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:54,180
And although there is only one each of the other pieces,

119
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:57,480
it's a mystery as to why there are two bishops.

120
00:07:57,481 --> 00:08:01,080
I have no idea what it means.

121
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,180
Yeah.

122
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,480
Doesn't it look like "he"?

123
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:07,980
From here, it looks like the hiragana character "he"!

124
00:08:07,981 --> 00:08:11,580
From here, it looks like the number seven.

125
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:13,880
That seems more likely.

126
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:17,680
The first code was the seven major titles of shogi,

127
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:21,280
and the second was the seven spears of Shizugatake.

128
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:23,281
True.

129
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:27,280
There's something written on the side of the piece.

130
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:30,080
"Show-off", it says.

131
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:32,980
There's something written on the bottom of the silver piece too.

132
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:34,780
"Lazy", it says.

133
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:38,780
The bishop that is nailed onto the rook, the bishop is the show-off,

134
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:42,480
and the gold general that is on top of the silver is the lazy one, right?

135
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,580
I got it!

136
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:46,380
The gold general is riding the silver

137
00:08:46,381 --> 00:08:48,680
and having it easy, that's why it's lazy!

138
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:52,380
The bishop is making itself look strong by carrying the rook,

139
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,380
that's why it's a show-off.

140
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:57,680
The rook is the strongest shogi piece after all, right?

141
00:08:57,681 --> 00:09:00,180
Amazing, Mitsuhiko!

142
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:02,780
I'm sure he's right!

143
00:09:02,781 --> 00:09:06,081
And? So what does that mean?

144
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,380
Well, I haven't thought that far yet.

145
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:12,980
But it's strange.

146
00:09:12,981 --> 00:09:17,680
The gold general is a hard worker that can move as much as the king

147
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:21,580
and the bishop is a strong piece that can move any distance diagonally.

148
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:24,881
It doesn't have to carry the rook to make itself look strong.

149
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:30,480
We only have two hours and a half to go before the time limit.

150
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:32,280
There's only about thirty minutes left,

151
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:35,180
if you plan to rescue Yumi

152
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:37,780
and head on to Yamanashi where the match is being held.

153
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:39,880
I don't intend to return.

154
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:41,280
-What? -What?

155
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,480
You said "choko" (you need time to think) and left, right?

156
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:46,880
Are you giving up?

157
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,680
If I didn't say "choko",

158
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:50,480
my defeat would've been definite.

159
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:55,180
I figured that my clock time would run out and put Yumi in danger.

160
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:59,180
Well, I can always try for the Septuple Crown some other time.

161
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,980
That's true.

162
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:04,981
Our priority now is to rescue Yumi.

163
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:11,980
But it sure looks like the perp knows who we are.

164
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:16,880
Because we're originally a group of six.

165
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:20,980
And the new seventh member.

166
00:10:20,981 --> 00:10:23,680
The new member.

167
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:25,780
The seventh member.

168
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:28,580
It's just like the pieces on this board, don't you think?

169
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:32,380
How do you know a new member was added?

170
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,080
The bishop! The bishop!

171
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:37,380
You start with only one bishop to begin with!

172
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:40,280
Yes. It's just like us now.

173
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:42,880
We're stalled from not being able to solve this difficult problem.

174
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:44,880
No, wrong!

175
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:47,380
The new member who joined us is...

176
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,880
-not that bishop! -Not that bishop!

177
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:52,980
There were eight members to start with, but now there are six.

178
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:56,280
Then another one joined the group.

179
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,481
No doubt about it.

180
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:00,980
The pieces on this board...

181
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:03,280
Indicate the seven!

182
00:11:03,281 --> 00:11:06,580
Judging from the position of this rook...

183
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:10,680
The place that Yumi is being confined is probably...

184
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:12,680
To the car. Hurry!

185
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:15,280
-What? -Did you figure it out?

186
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:18,880
Yeah! Yumi's in Haido-cho!

187
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:24,981
"2 hours and 18 minutes left for Shukichi Haneda."

188
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:30,780
The Seven Deadly Sins?

189
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:34,280
The pieces on the shogi board indicate that?

190
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:35,380
Yeah.

191
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:38,580
The Seven Deadly Sins were originally the eight sins of gluttony,

192
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:45,180
lust, greed, sorrow, wrath, sloth, vanity and pride.

193
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:49,580
Vanity merged with pride, and sorrow with sloth.

194
00:11:49,581 --> 00:11:54,080
Then envy was later added to make the modern seven.

195
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:57,480
Just like the pieces on the shogi board.

196
00:11:57,481 --> 00:12:01,080
But which piece indicates what sin?

197
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:03,880
There were two bishops, right?

198
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:06,580
No. The bishop that was pierced

199
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:09,480
had show-off written on it, so it's vanity.

200
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:13,280
The other bishop based on its position is envy.

201
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:15,580
Right, Taiko Meijin?

202
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:16,680
Yeah.

203
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:18,880
Since the bishop can only move diagonally,

204
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:21,280
it can only land on certain squares.

205
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:25,280
Therefore, the bishop that was not there to begin with, was there

206
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:30,380
because it was captured and placed there.

207
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:34,580
In other words, it's the newcomer, envy.

208
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:36,180
I see.

209
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:38,280
The gold general labeled lazy is sloth

210
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:41,480
because it's riding the sorrowful silver general.

211
00:12:41,481 --> 00:12:46,280
And the rook that is on top of the vain bishop is pride.

212
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:48,980
Moreover, the rook placed there

213
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:51,680
signifies an aggressive and high-handed position.

214
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:54,780
High-handedness is often associated with pride.

215
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:57,180
Yes.

216
00:12:57,181 --> 00:12:59,480
I don't quite get it,

217
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:02,080
but where do we go from here?

218
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,080
The rook that is pierced with the nail is "arrogant".

219
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:08,080
Another word meaning the same thing is "pride."

220
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:09,081
The place in this area

221
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:13,380
with the word "pride" in its name is Hotel Hyde Pride.

222
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:16,780
I'm sure that's where Yumi is being held captive.

223
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:19,780
What a considerate kidnapper, though.

224
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:21,880
Leaving so many clues behind.

225
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:23,080
He probably wanted to let us know,

226
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:26,380
even if somebody came along and pried the pieces off.

227
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:28,380
After all, even if worse came to worst,

228
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:30,480
it's not impossible to solve the problem with the single word "pride".

229
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:36,581
I'm sure the perp can't wait and is desperate for Taiko Meijin to come.

230
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:40,980
But is that really the last place?

231
00:13:40,981 --> 00:13:43,480
Yeah. Until this point, the codes

232
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:48,780
were labeled first, second and third game, right?

233
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:51,280
Since we solved codes one through three,

234
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:54,880
if we win the next fourth game of the Meijin title match,

235
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,481
it's our win!

236
00:13:58,081 --> 00:13:59,980
We're at the hotel,

237
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:01,880
but what do we look for?

238
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:03,380
Don't worry.

239
00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:06,580
The perp wants Taiko Meijin to come.

240
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:08,981
So most probably, if we ask the front desk...

241
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:12,080
Mr. Haneda!

242
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:15,581
I was told to show you to the room when you arrive.

243
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:19,681
Mr. Haneda has arrived.

244
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:24,380
The door lock is sealed with masking tape.

245
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:26,280
Does that mean just enter?

246
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:27,580
Oh, wait!

247
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:28,780
Yumi!

248
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:30,980
Answer me if you're there!

249
00:14:30,981 --> 00:14:32,980
Yumi!

250
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:35,780
That's as far as you go.

251
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:39,080
Shukichi Haneda is the only one allowed in this room.

252
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:40,580
If you break that rule,

253
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:43,781
the bomb embedded in the sofa will explode.

254
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:48,280
I warned you not to tell anyone

255
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:49,780
and yet you have all these people here with you.

256
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:51,880
Well, I guess it's okay

257
00:14:51,881 --> 00:14:53,980
because they don't look like police people.

258
00:14:53,981 --> 00:14:58,580
It was you, after all, Mr. Tanimori.

259
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:02,780
It's time to replay that match of ten years ago.

260
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:05,480
Please sit down.

261
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:08,080
I'm sure you've already forgotten,

262
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:11,780
but back then, I had you in check with my 4-2 promoted pawn?

263
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:13,680
Same position, king!

264
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:17,480
I haven't forgotten that match.

265
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:20,180
That match hasn't left my mind these ten years. Not even for a moment.

266
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:24,380
Go ahead, take your promoted pawn with my king.

267
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,380
Well, if you say so.

268
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:31,581
Then my winning 4-8 rook will explode!

269
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:37,180
Now I've forked your king and silver general!

270
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:39,181
I win!

271
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:44,580
Keiko, I finally did it.

272
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:47,080
I've finally taken revenge for what happened ten years ago.

273
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:49,981
Finally, Keiko!

274
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:53,680
4-7 bishop.

275
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:54,980
What?

276
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:57,381
4-7 bishop?

277
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,580
Same... same position, rook.

278
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:02,580
5-1 king.

279
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:05,280
5-3 lance and check.

280
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:06,980
6-2 king.

281
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:09,680
4-2 rook and check.

282
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:11,681
7-1 king.

283
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,980
Now my king is safe

284
00:16:16,981 --> 00:16:19,181
and yours is checkmated.

285
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:23,380
When I realized I could win,

286
00:16:23,381 --> 00:16:24,880
I felt a tremor in my heart,

287
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:28,881
I dropped the piece that I was playing with and made that sound.

288
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:34,481
4-7 bishop is a brilliant comeback move.

289
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:39,781
Which means I would've lost the match either way.

290
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:42,580
I'm sorry,

291
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:43,880
before the match started,

292
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:47,780
I happened to overhear you talking on the phone.

293
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:49,780
What?

294
00:16:49,781 --> 00:16:51,580
No matter how bad my wife's condition is,

295
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:54,880
I can't go to the hospital until the match is over.

296
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,980
Please tell my wife to hang in there

297
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:59,981
because I'll try my very best in the match too.

298
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:04,980
Wanting to end the match as quickly as possible,

299
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:06,580
although I didn't mean to,

300
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:09,880
I guess I made a rude remark.

301
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:12,880
Then, what you said back then...

302
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:16,680
A post-match discussion won't be necessary, will it?

303
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:20,081
You said it so that I could go to the hospital immediately.

304
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:26,180
I've lost in every way.

305
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:29,480
Please undo the bomb!

306
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,781
Don't worry. This is just a bluff.

307
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:38,380
She's just asleep on drugs,

308
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:40,181
Taiko Meijin.

309
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:50,281
Yumi?

310
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:54,480
Chu... Chukichi?

311
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:55,881
Yumi.

312
00:17:56,981 --> 00:17:58,480
Where is this?

313
00:17:58,481 --> 00:18:00,480
Inside the mini police car.

314
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:03,380
Conan contacted me.

315
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:07,180
He told me that Mr. Haneda rescued you who was kidnapped

316
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:10,280
so to come pick you up right away.

317
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:14,180
Come to think of it, where's the man that abducted me?

318
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:18,681
Dr. Agasa already drove him to the police and he turned himself in.

319
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:23,080
And? Where's this mini police car headed for?

320
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:24,280
To the hospital

321
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:26,880
since you've been confined for a whole two days,

322
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:28,280
so just to be safe...

323
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:31,280
He didn't do anything sexual with me, though.

324
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:33,180
Just as I got out of the cafe,

325
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:35,880
he snuffed me out with some drug and kidnapped me,

326
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:40,580
but he let me use the bathroom and fed me too.

327
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:43,580
But, Mr. Haneda, you're amazing.

328
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:49,280
You stood up an important match today just for Yumi.

329
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:50,780
What match?

330
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:53,980
Well, today was the Meijin title match.

331
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:55,480
The Meijin title match?

332
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:58,080
And, where and when is it?

333
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:02,580
I've got to be at the Tokiwa Hotel in Yamanashi by 15:00.

334
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:05,380
But there's only less than an hour and a half, so I don't think I'll...

335
00:19:05,381 --> 00:19:09,981
Chukichi! Don't take this car lightly now.

336
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:13,580
Hey, you! The car in front!

337
00:19:13,581 --> 00:19:16,181
Change lanes and let us through!

338
00:19:17,181 --> 00:19:19,980
Come on get with it, stop dilly-dallying and move it!

339
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:22,980
Yumi, you're going too far.

340
00:19:22,981 --> 00:19:26,980
We've already made it into Yamanashi besides.

341
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:29,380
Mini police car over there! Pull over!

342
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:31,981
I thought so.

343
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:36,480
I guess your police ID is authentic,

344
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:37,780
but what is it?

345
00:19:37,781 --> 00:19:39,680
This is Yamanashi Prefecture, you know?

346
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:42,280
We've got our reasons, you see.

347
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:46,180
We've got to hurry or Chukichi will be late for his Mejin title match!

348
00:19:46,181 --> 00:19:47,581
Meijin title match?

349
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:51,280
Taiko Meijin!

350
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:52,880
Yes?

351
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:55,380
Do you remember? It's me!

352
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:57,881
You gave me your autograph at the cafe the other day.

353
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:04,580
What's this?

354
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:07,180
Don't tell me that you're some kind of celebrity, Chukichi?

355
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:08,881
He is.

356
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:13,580
"Tokiwa Hotel" -See you, Taiko Meijin!

357
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:15,681
I wish all the best for you!

358
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:19,880
It's 14:57.

359
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:21,480
We really made it.

360
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:24,080
It's gone?

361
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:25,480
What is?

362
00:20:25,481 --> 00:20:29,080
The picture! The one you gestured a "V" pose.

363
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:31,380
I must've dropped it somewhere.

364
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:34,980
Never mind that, just hurry up and go!

365
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:38,480
But, that's my good luck charm!

366
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:39,980
Even during the Meijin match last year,

367
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:42,381
just because I forgot it...

368
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:55,080
How's this?

369
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:59,580
I'll bet it'll bring you more luck than the photo.

370
00:20:59,581 --> 00:21:00,581
Yes!

371
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:02,980
Okay, then off you go!

372
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:04,481
Okay!

373
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:11,380
I didn't know that there was a Meijin title match of Rakugo.

374
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:13,081
Rakugo?

375
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:16,080
You see, that kimono!

376
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:19,581
Isn't that the kind you wear at the amateur Rakugo Meijin match?

377
00:21:32,581 --> 00:21:34,481
Thirty seconds.

378
00:21:35,781 --> 00:21:37,580
Thank you for waiting.

379
00:21:37,581 --> 00:21:39,580
I don't mind,

380
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:41,180
but is it okay with you?

381
00:21:41,181 --> 00:21:43,780
You've used up your clock time

382
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:46,480
and only have a minute left.

383
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:49,580
Yes. For me now,

384
00:21:49,581 --> 00:21:52,381
a minute is infinite.

385
00:23:14,381 --> 00:23:18,780
There's a police car parked in front of this hotel but...

386
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:20,980
Do you know what happened?

387
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:22,680
No.

388
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:24,180
Beats me.

389
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:25,381
What?

390
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:30,680
What's with that reaction of yours?

391
00:23:30,681 --> 00:23:32,480
You're grossing me out.

392
00:23:32,481 --> 00:23:35,381
"Taiko Meijin Acquires Seven Crowns!"

393
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:45,480
"Next Episode" -How spacious!

394
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:47,281
Aren't you excited, too?

395
00:23:50,381 --> 00:23:51,381
Yes.

396
00:23:51,382 --> 00:23:53,180
Who's that lady?

397
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,980
Daughter of the President Oiso we just mentioned.

398
00:23:56,981 --> 00:23:58,480
What?

399
00:23:58,481 --> 00:23:59,980
My necklace.

400
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:02,080
Since you were swimming till a while ago,

401
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:04,581
could it be in the pool?

402
00:24:06,781 --> 00:24:08,280
