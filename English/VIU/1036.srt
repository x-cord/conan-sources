1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,399
Kotatsus, Shiruko, and snowmen!

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,500
Camping is nice, but skiing is great!

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,199
I'm so excited to visit the ski slope.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,399
I know. Ai should've come with us.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,800
Yeah.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,200
It couldn't be helped.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,799
She said there's no way she'd come since it'd be cold.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,999
The least we can do is bring back plenty of souvenirs for her.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,600
Yeah!

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,600
What's that?

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,199
Maybe they got stuck.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,600
Looks like it.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,399
The love for deduction and the exhilaration of

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,599
unravelling mysteries that comes before sleep!

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,699
The Youth Detective Squad

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,799
narrowly escape danger in the snowy mountains!

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,399
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,199
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,800
His name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,000
"Whiteout (Part 1)"

21
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,399
Heave ho.

22
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,899
Huff, huff.

23
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,499
There we go.

24
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,299
Ready, and...

25
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,899
Push.

26
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,299
Ready, and...

27
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,899
Push.

28
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,499
Ready, and...

29
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,899
Push.

30
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,999
All right!

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,500
We did it!

32
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,299
Thank you.

33
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,499
For a while there, I wasn't sure what we were going to do.

34
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,499
Thank you.

35
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,999
No problem. We should help each other when we're in need.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,099
Could we get your contact information?

37
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,400
-What? -Please allow us to thank you.

38
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,499
Oh, I'm sorry.

39
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,899
My name is Kengo Ishibashi.

40
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,399
I develop medicines in Tokyo.

41
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,299
This is Dr. Yokoyama.

42
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,400
Thank you for your help.

43
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Conan, look at those.

44
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,199
Rifles?

45
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,199
They've got bullets, too.

46
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,300
Conan, do you think those men are...

47
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,800
Don't worry. We're not shady people.

48
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,499
We came here to enjoy some sport hunting.

49
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,799
Sport?

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,499
Hunting?

51
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,599
That's right, hunting.

52
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,499
Those certainly are guns,

53
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,999
but we've been authorized to use them.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,399
You're going to shoot animals?

55
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,699
Well, yeah. I guess so.

56
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,000
I feel sorry for them.

57
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,599
What's your name, miss?

58
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,199
Ayumi.

59
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,599
Ayumi,

60
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,399
you eat meat, don't you?

61
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,899
Yeah.

62
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,299
Humans are supported by the lives of many other creatures.

63
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,100
We're grateful to the animals we hunt.

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,100
Shall we get going?

65
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,599
Thank you so much.

66
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,100
See you later.

67
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,599
It's huge!

68
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,199
We made it.

69
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,899
Come on. The slopes are waiting for us.

70
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,700
Yeah!

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,299
Let's go all the way up to the very top.

72
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,700
You think we'll be able to ski back down?

73
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,999
So, what are we supposed to do?

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,599
He says to wait for now.

75
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,499
Unbelievable. I don't want to get dragged into any trouble.

76
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,399
What are you talking about?

77
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,899
We got dragged into trouble a long time ago.

78
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,299
Before we knew it, we were deep in it.

79
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,299
He also said to be ready to move anytime.

80
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,899
Yeah, yeah.

81
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,699
Hey, where are you going?

82
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,099
I'm getting coffee.

83
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,399
You want some, right?

84
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,900
Yeah, bring me a hot one.

85
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,800
Here I come!

86
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's go.

87
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,500
Thanks for the food.

88
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,600
This place's curry is good!

89
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,499
This ramen is great, too.

90
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,400
I wonder why everything tastes better at a ski resort.

91
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,499
That was great, but I could eat more.

92
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,099
Let's go ski some more.

93
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,699
Sorry, but my whole body hurts.

94
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,399
I'm at my limit.

95
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,199
You kids go without me.

96
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,500
Got it.

97
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,699
Let's go, Conan.

98
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,500
Yeah.

99
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,099
Let me know right away if anything comes up.

100
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,900
Okay!

101
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,799
Yokoyama, I have a special favor to ask you.

102
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,199
A special favor?

103
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,499
Out here?

104
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,499
You know what I mean.

105
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,799
It's about the new medicine we developed.

106
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,699
Let's not talk about that right now.

107
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:42,200
Couldn't you officially use our medicine at your hospital?

108
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,999
Ishibashi...

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,299
We poured a lot of time and money into that medicine.

110
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,900
An irrevocable amount.

111
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,299
Can't you nod your head in agreement today?

112
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,599
You know my company will go bankrupt if you don't, don't you?

113
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,400
I know.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,599
But, Ishibashi,

115
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,099
you've been hiding something important from me.

116
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,199
What?

117
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,799
Don't play dumb.

118
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,300
It's about the medicine's side effects.

119
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,499
Our job makes us responsible for people's lives.

120
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:26,100
You should know I can't ignore that medicine's side effects.

121
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,699
You mean...

122
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:35,100
Yes. Unfortunately, our hospital can't use your medicine.

123
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,400
I see.

124
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,599
By the way, Dr. Yokoyama.

125
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,799
Didn't you say people are supported by the deaths of many others?

126
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,499
Did you know?

127
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,799
Our medicine will be adopted by your hospital

128
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,299
as long as you're out of the picture.

129
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,299
Are you going to shoot me here?

130
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,199
Yeah, right. You're a far better shot than I am.

131
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,800
So I tampered with your gun.

132
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,800
Sorry, but you're going to die here.

133
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,099
What a view.

134
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,400
It's so pretty.

135
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,000
Is something wrong?

136
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,900
That brat.

137
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,300
I've got to do something about her.

138
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,300
All right, let's go.

139
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,100
Ayumi, is something wrong?

140
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
I...

141
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,299
You witnessed a murder?

142
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,599
Really?

143
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,899
Yeah, probably.

144
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,699
When? Where?

145
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,499
Just now while riding the lift,

146
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,899
I saw something in the woods.

147
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,599
Two men were fighting.

148
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,999
One of them had a knife.

149
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,500
It couldn't have been anything else?

150
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,499
Maybe they were filming a TV show.

151
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,899
Then there would've been cameras in the area.

152
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,100
Oh, right.

153
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,799
Conan, what should we do?

154
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,999
You saw them in the woods while riding the lift, right?

155
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,199
Yeah.

156
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,300
We'll start by calling the police.

157
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,000
What? Is something wrong?

158
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,499
He's the culprit.

159
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
-Huh? -What?

160
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,299
Isn't that the old guy whose car got stuck earlier?

161
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,599
Didn't he say his name was Ishibashi?

162
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,999
Ayumi, does that mean the man who was stabbed was...

163
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,200
Yeah, it was the other man who was with him.

164
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,199
Stay here. I'll be right back.

165
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,999
What? Conan!

166
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Hey, Conan!

167
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,200
That's him!

168
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,400
This man stabbed someone with a knife.

169
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,300
I'm sorry, but is what this boy saying true?

170
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,999
Give me a break.

171
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,499
Why would I stab someone?

172
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,499
He's not lying! I saw it happen!

173
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,399
Ishibashi, there's a witness.

174
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,799
You should give yourself up.

175
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,399
Excuse me, sir.

176
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,099
I give up.

177
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,799
These kids are always like this.

178
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,799
The other day, they accused me of being a kidnapper.

179
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,599
I can't believe they're calling me a murderer this time.

180
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,199
You know them?

181
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,599
Of course I know them.

182
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,199
Right, Ayumi?

183
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,899
What? Uh...

184
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,299
Come to think of this, this boy wearing glasses said your name.

185
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,899
It's not like that!

186
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,799
We just ran into him on the road earlier!

187
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,999
That's right! We don't know you at all!

188
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,999
Kids, you shouldn't lie.

189
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's right.

190
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:05,999
You shouldn't play jokes on adults like that.

191
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,499
We're not lying!

192
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,199
It's true!

193
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,099
This man is dressed normally at a ski resort.

194
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,700
Don't you think it's odd?

195
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,399
Hey, you're right.

196
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,299
Well, I don't know the first thing about skiing.

197
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,799
That's not it.

198
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,399
It's because you rushed here after your crime was witnessed.

199
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,799
Come on, now.

200
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,599
The person with you was a doctor, right?

201
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,699
If this is just a misunderstanding, then where is he right now?

202
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,899
Dr. Yokoyama is currently at the lodge.

203
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,599
Trouble between a doctor and a drug manufacturer, huh?

204
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,999
I bet you got into a fight after he either rejected a bribe

205
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
or refused to use your newly developed medicine.

206
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,699
Hey, mister.

207
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,599
In any case, call the police.

208
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
This person is a bad guy.

209
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,300
A murder at a ski resort...

210
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,699
Do you think he used a wire in his trick?

211
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,700
No, maybe it was a ski pole.

212
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,600
They didn't believe us from the start.

213
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,999
Yeah, I finally found them.

214
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,499
Could you come meet me at the restaurant on the slope?

215
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,200
Yeah, thanks.

216
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,199
All right, everyone.

217
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,299
Someone will be here to pick us up soon.

218
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,999
Shall we go together?

219
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,100
Run, guys!

220
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,099
Hey, you kids!

221
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,600
Those kids are a handful.

222
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,699
Do those brats really think they can escape?

223
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,399
Where are we going?

224
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,299
We'll ski down the slope.

225
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,300
What?

226
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:03,399
You saw him. He's not wearing any skiing gear.

227
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,999
We should be able to escape if we ski down the hill.

228
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,399
I see. Good thinking, Conan.

229
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,999
Hurry. He's right behind us.

230
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,800
Darn kids.

231
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,700
We're turning you in to the police, old dude!

232
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,000
That brat.

233
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,499
Hey, Genta.

234
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,999
Where are Ayumi and Mitsuhiko?

235
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,799
-Up there. -We need to hurry.

236
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,799
Mitsuhiko, you're going too fast.

237
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,899
Yeah, but...

238
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,099
Mitsuhiko, watch out!

239
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,699
Huh? What?

240
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,800
"No Skiing Outside Trail"

241
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,700
Ayumi, Mitsuhiko!

242
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Mitsuhiko, Ayumi!

243
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,699
I thought we were going to die.

244
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,299
That was so scary.

245
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,799
I'm glad you're both all right.

246
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,699
But what are we going to do?

247
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,000
Can we walk back to the trail on such a steep hill?

248
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,999
No service, huh?

249
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Let's go.

250
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,499
Go where?

251
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,299
We'll start by looking for a path.

252
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,699
Once we have cell phone service,

253
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,199
we'll call the Dr. Agasa right away.

254
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,799
What if we can't reach him?

255
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,599
It's all right. We'll find someone once we're on a path.

256
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,999
Then we'll call the police and explain the situation.

257
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Okay.

258
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,299
When's the last time I felt so inconvenienced by a child's body?

259
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,599
I don't know how far they'll be able to make it.

260
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,000
We need to find a path as soon as possible.

261
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,199
Now then, maybe I'll head back onto the slope soon.

262
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,699
The number you are calling is...

263
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,899
I can't reach them.

264
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,600
Well, I'm sure I'll find them on the beginner trail.

265
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,799
Are you guys okay?

266
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,899
This is nothing.

267
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,200
I can keep walking, too.

268
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,199
I'm sorry, everyone.

269
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,699
Mitsuhiko.

270
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,499
If I hadn't left the trail, this wouldn't have happened.

271
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,199
We told you, this is nothing.

272
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,800
And I can keep walking for a while, too.

273
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,899
Guys...

274
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,499
Mitsuhiko, it's not your fault.

275
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,999
The culprit is to blame.

276
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,299
Don't worry about it.

277
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
But...

278
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,700
Hey, look at that.

279
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,899
I see people. There are people up there.

280
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,299
Hey!

281
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,199
-Great. -Hey!

282
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,699
We're up here!

283
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,000
Why do I feel like something's wrong?

284
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,899
What are those two doing over there?

285
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,400
Hey!

286
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,300
Crap.

287
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,599
Yeah, I finally found them.

288
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,200
Could you come meet me at the restaurant on the slope?

289
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,099
Yeah, thanks.

290
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,399
Head back up the hill, guys!

291
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,699
-What? -What are you talking about?

292
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,400
Just hurry!

293
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,499
What's the matter?

294
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,899
Yeah, we finally found some adults.

295
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,199
They're probably working with Ishibashi.

296
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,399
What?

297
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,699
Ishibashi called someone to come to the slope earlier.

298
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,999
That means he has accomplices nearby.

299
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,399
And besides, what do you think

300
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,899
they were doing out here in the middle of nowhere?

301
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,999
Well...

302
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,699
They're looking for us.

303
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,399
That's right. Let's hurry.

304
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,000
We're doomed if they catch us.

305
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,599
Those are some sharp kids.

306
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,900
They're just little kids. We'll catch up soon.

307
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,199
This isn't good.

308
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,199
At this rate, we won't be able to escape.

309
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,599
What should we do?

310
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,399
I only have one tranquilizer dart,

311
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,199
and I'm not wearing my power-enhancing shoes.

312
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,000
How can we take down both of them at once?

313
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,200
Guys, give me a hand.

314
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,199
Pile all the snow you can onto the sled.

315
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,499
Hurry.

316
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,900
Got it.

317
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,400
-Conan. -More.

318
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,400
All right. Let's go!

319
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,799
Too bad, kids. You missed.

320
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,300
Nice aim, kid.

321
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,499
Bullseye.

322
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,699
-All right! -Nice work, Conan.

323
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,700
Let's hurry.

324
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,300
Now then...

325
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,500
What's that?

326
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,899
It's a cabin.

327
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,700
We're saved.

328
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,999
Now they've done it.

329
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,799
Come on, hurry up.

330
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,900
Yes, sir.

331
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,500
You just wait, kids.

332
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,599
Are you really going to kill those kids?

333
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,699
There's no turning back now.

334
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,899
I've already killed a man.

335
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,799
A whiteout.

336
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,399
It's no use. I can't see anything.

337
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,099
Everything's white.

338
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,699
Conan.
