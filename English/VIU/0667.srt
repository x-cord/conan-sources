1
00:00:00,602 --> 00:00:02,702
Man's voi Raita, Hatsune!

2
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:05,102
Congratulations to your marriage!

3
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:11,002
Oh well, even if you congratulate us now,

4
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:12,402
our wedding's tomorrow.

5
00:00:12,402 --> 00:00:15,202
"Raita Banba (37), Groom" -It's not like we're married yet.

6
00:00:15,202 --> 00:00:18,002
"Hatsune Kamon (37), Bride" -No big deal. Tonight's our wedding eve.

7
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:19,602
After we finish the wedding,

8
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,202
we're going to fly off to our honeymoon right away.

9
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:23,602
True.

10
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:25,302
Love birds.

11
00:00:25,302 --> 00:00:26,602
How I envy you!

12
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:28,902
Hey, long time no see, Mouri.

13
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:31,802
So he's the famed detective?

14
00:00:31,802 --> 00:00:36,102
Yeah, he's my bad friend in my high school day, Kogoro Mouri.

15
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,602
How do you do? I'm Hatsune.

16
00:00:38,602 --> 00:00:40,102
Well, hello, hello.

17
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:43,402
Which means the two beside you are your...

18
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:46,302
I'm his daughter, Ran.

19
00:00:46,302 --> 00:00:48,202
I'm freeloader, Conan.

20
00:00:48,202 --> 00:00:51,802
He's staying with us temporarily.

21
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:54,502
I hear that you both fell in love at first sight.

22
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:58,102
Yeah, I felt it was destiny the instant we met.

23
00:00:58,102 --> 00:01:00,802
It was like we finally found each other.

24
00:01:00,802 --> 00:01:03,602
I mean after all, our birthdays, blood types,

25
00:01:03,602 --> 00:01:05,302
and the environment we come from are the same.

26
00:01:05,302 --> 00:01:06,802
Sometimes even we understand each other mutually

27
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:09,902
without saying a word too.

28
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:13,102
Thank you for waiting.

29
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:16,802
-Hey! -I'm sorry.

30
00:01:16,802 --> 00:01:20,102
-My God! It's stuck all over my pants. -Oh, no.

31
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:22,602
You're stepping on the cake.

32
00:01:22,602 --> 00:01:24,002
I'm really sorry.

33
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:26,502
This is my first day part-timing here.

34
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:27,602
Don't worry about it.

35
00:01:27,602 --> 00:01:29,202
But, will you please bring a wet towel

36
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:31,402
that we can use to wipe the pants off?

37
00:01:31,402 --> 00:01:33,802
Yes, ma'am, right away.

38
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:38,602
Hey, stop giving the eye just because that waiter's good-looking.

39
00:01:38,602 --> 00:01:41,002
Are you jealous?

40
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:42,002
Of course not.

41
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,002
You haven't changed.

42
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:46,402
You got fast hands and you're always jealous.

43
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:47,702
Knock it off.

44
00:01:47,702 --> 00:01:52,302
You used to glare at the guys who gave passes to Eri too, didn't you?

45
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:54,702
-What? -Is that true?

46
00:01:54,702 --> 00:01:56,202
Good grief.

47
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:58,202
It's too tough keeping up with the possessiveness

48
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,302
of all the kings, don't you think?

49
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:02,002
Where are you going?

50
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:03,502
To the nail salon.

51
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:06,902
To get my nails a deco chip for my wedding.

52
00:02:06,902 --> 00:02:09,502
You don't have to do something like that.

53
00:02:09,502 --> 00:02:11,202
It's raining pretty hard.

54
00:02:11,202 --> 00:02:13,702
I've got to. I've already made reservations too.

55
00:02:13,702 --> 00:02:16,602
Besides, all the employees at the salon are women,

56
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,602
so there's no need to worry.

57
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:20,402
I told you before, but...

58
00:02:20,402 --> 00:02:23,002
If you cheat on me, I'll make you pay.

59
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:25,802
That's my line.

60
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:26,902
Honey.

61
00:02:30,102 --> 00:02:32,402
I'll be back in about two hours,

62
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,102
so when I do take a look at my nails, okay?

63
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:35,102
Okay.

64
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:40,002
She should put them on just before her wedding ceremony.

65
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:43,002
Because she'll be taking them off before she goes to sleep anyway.

66
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:47,302
I hear that you keep nail chips on for 24 hours straight.

67
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:49,002
Even when you take a bath?

68
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,002
Yes.

69
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:53,502
Woman really have it tough.

70
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,302
The vivid coloured memories of summer.

71
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:00,302
Solve mysteries all season round.

72
00:03:00,302 --> 00:03:02,002
An unbelievable car explosion.

73
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:04,102
Attack the two on their wedding eve.

74
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:05,602
He sees through the one and only truth.

75
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,902
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

76
00:03:07,902 --> 00:03:10,102
His name is Detective Conan!

77
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:55,099
"Wedding Eve (Part 1)"

78
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:58,899
Come on, it's my last night as a bachelor,

79
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,299
so come on be nice to me, will you?

80
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:02,999
Really, Banba...

81
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:04,799
Your wife's going to get at you, you know?

82
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,199
Good grief,

83
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,099
he's already got himself a beautiful wife and yet...

84
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:13,799
Really, he's just like somebody I know excuse me, sir.

85
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:17,599
Excuse me.

86
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:21,099
You again?

87
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:22,099
What is it now?

88
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:24,599
Your phone's been ringing repeatedly from a while ago.

89
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:25,999
If you will excuse me, then...

90
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:26,999
Yeah.

91
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:30,899
It's a mail from Hatsune.

92
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:32,999
You're not answering the phone,

93
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,499
so I'm sending you a picture of it.

94
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:37,199
You'll get to see the real thing in 30 minutes.

95
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,599
What's with you? You're lovey-dovey!

96
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:41,799
-Well, sort of... -Well, thanks a lot.

97
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:44,499
Sorry, I gotta go to the john.

98
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:45,899
-Bye. -Bye.

99
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,299
A second cell phone?

100
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:51,699
He's talking to somebody wearing a dreadful look.

101
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:57,299
He hung up right away.

102
00:05:57,299 --> 00:06:00,799
And, he's going straight to the john...

103
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:04,899
Which means that the person he's talking to is in the toilet.

104
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,199
What's the matter, Conan?

105
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,799
Did you see anyone you know?

106
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:11,099
No, it's nothing.

107
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,599
Well, I guess it doesn't matter.

108
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:18,299
"Sanji Haruoka (48), Customer"

109
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:19,499
Don't tell me...

110
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:22,099
that guy was on the other end of the line?

111
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:23,099
Waiter!

112
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,499
Yes.

113
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:25,999
Thank you for waiting.

114
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:27,799
Bourbon on the rocks.

115
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:29,399
Yes, sir.

116
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,199
Be careful, idiot!

117
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,799
I... I'm sorry.

118
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:37,999
Banba, you're drinking too much.

119
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:39,799
I'm fine. Fine.

120
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:43,499
-Hey, waiter. -Yes?

121
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:45,799
Do you remember what I ordered?

122
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:48,299
Yes, Bourbon on the rocks, right?

123
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:50,699
Okay. You got it right.

124
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:51,699
Then...

125
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:56,599
Banba, what's that scary look on your face for?

126
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:59,399
It's nothing.

127
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:04,799
This party is like a reunion to you too, isn't it, Pops?

128
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,999
Yeah, it seems that the bride-to-be had her wedding party

129
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,799
on a different day so...

130
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:12,699
Mom couldn't come because of work, though.

131
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,099
Then, is that man wearing sunglasses also your classmate?

132
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:21,399
I don't remember.

133
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,799
I mean, it's already been 20 years, after all.

134
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:39,799
Hello.

135
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:42,299
Yes, that's right.

136
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:43,699
Yes.

137
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:46,199
Yes, and?

138
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,999
Yes, yes.

139
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,799
Hey, just what're you doing?

140
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,099
Oh, well...

141
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,599
This guest suddenly started to punch me.

142
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:01,999
Are you all right?

143
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:03,199
Don't touch me!

144
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,599
Banba.

145
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:07,699
You drank too much.

146
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:10,599
-Your hand is bleeding. -It's no darn big deal.

147
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,999
No big deal... Hey, you should get it treated.

148
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:15,299
Banba, are you listening, or what?

149
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:19,999
The only one I need to talk to now is Hatsune.

150
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,999
Hey, Hatsune?

151
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:23,199
Where are you now?

152
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:26,799
Goodbye?

153
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,499
What're you talking about, Hatsune?

154
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:29,699
Hey, Hatsune?

155
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,199
Hatsune? Where are you now?

156
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:39,099
Don't tell me... that the car is Hatsune's.

157
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:40,399
-What? -Oh, no.

158
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,099
Ran, call the fire department, the ambulance and the police!

159
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:44,099
Okay!

160
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,799
-Store manager! Where's the fire extinguisher? -Hatsune.

161
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,899
-Yes, it's here! -Hatsune.

162
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,699
-Okay! It's dangerous... -Hatsune.

163
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:49,999
-so don't let anyone out of the restaurant! -Are you all right?

164
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:51,199
-Yes, sir! -Hatsune!

165
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:56,299
"Hatsune Kamon"

166
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:59,999
Hatsune!

167
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:04,999
The body is burnt black

168
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:08,699
and we're having the dental records for a match right now.

169
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:10,499
It is highly probable that the victim is...

170
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:14,599
the owner of this car, Ms. Hatsune Kamon.

171
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:16,399
Is it true that a phone call was received

172
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,999
from Ms. Kamon just before the car burned

173
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:21,099
hinting that she may be wanting to commit suicide?

174
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:22,999
-Yes. -Inspector.

175
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:28,099
There are two large travel suitcases in the trunk.

176
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:32,699
They were probably getting ready to go on a honeymoon.

177
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:35,099
Because the woman who passed away was supposed to get married

178
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:38,199
to my old friend tomorrow.

179
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:41,899
But, why would such a happy person commit suicide?

180
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:43,299
I wonder...

181
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:46,199
Maybe she had what you call the marriage blues or something?

182
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:48,899
Officer Takagi.

183
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,899
-Hey! Not you again! -Come, come.

184
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,099
What is it, Conan?

185
00:09:53,099 --> 00:09:54,899
This is a fake nail, isn't it?

186
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:59,299
True. But why would it be in a place like this?

187
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,799
Ms. Kamon left the party

188
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,699
saying that she was going to a nail salon

189
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:05,599
about two hours ago.

190
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:06,599
What?

191
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:12,499
Maybe it's better not to conclude that she committed suicide yet.

192
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,599
What? A murder?

193
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,099
You mean it's not suicide?

194
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:19,099
Yeah.

195
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:20,299
Although very slight,

196
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:24,399
there was skin stuck on the tip of the fake nail that Conan found.

197
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,699
I hear that she just got those fake nails put on her just a while ago.

198
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:29,099
Which means that it is highly likely

199
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:31,799
that the skin on the fake nail is of the culprit

200
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,599
that she fought with near the car.

201
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:37,199
Who on earth...

202
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:39,699
Who could've killed Hatsune?

203
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:42,399
You're Raita Banba,

204
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,699
who was married to Ms. Kamon, aren't you?

205
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:46,599
Yeah, that's right.

206
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:49,399
Where did you hurt your hand?

207
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,699
I... I hurt myself a while ago when I fell

208
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:53,499
and cut myself with the shattered piece of the cracked glass cup.

209
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:57,999
Then, does this hairbrush look familiar to you?

210
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:00,299
Yeah, that's mine.

211
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:03,599
I had it in my travel suitcase, though.

212
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:06,899
Yes, it was in your suitcase

213
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,099
that was in the trunk of the car that burned.

214
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:12,699
Just in case we checked the DNA from he hair we gathered from this brush

215
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:15,999
and as a result found a match.

216
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:17,999
It almost matched the DNA of the skin

217
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:21,599
that was found on the tip of her fake nail.

218
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,599
What?

219
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,699
Just what are you talking about?

220
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:32,699
Are you saying that I'm the culprit or what?

221
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:33,699
Oh, no...

222
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:36,599
Because it's still not a perfect match.

223
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:38,699
If possible we would like to get your approval

224
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,899
to perform a more accurate test.

225
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,299
You must be joking!

226
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:43,999
Cool it, Banba.

227
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,599
You didn't do it, right?

228
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:47,999
-Of course not. -But...

229
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,299
It's thinkable that she scratched him trying to resist his attack,

230
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:51,999
and in order to hide the wound that he got then,

231
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:54,999
he could've deliberately punched me

232
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,699
to make it look like he hurt himself then, right?

233
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:58,899
Why, how dare you?

234
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:00,599
Look who's talking.

235
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:03,399
I'll bet you killed your dear darling

236
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,399
before she fell into the arms of someone else,

237
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,999
didn't you, Mr. waiter?

238
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:09,899
Hey, hold it.

239
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,599
What is this about?

240
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:13,199
If you're not going to say it yourself,

241
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,299
I'll say it for you.

242
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:18,699
He's Hatsune's lover

243
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:20,099
and they've been seeing each other secretly!

244
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:21,299
What?

245
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:23,499
Is that true?

246
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:26,099
How about it?

247
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,399
Of course I've been seeing her.

248
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,699
After all, I was hired by her.

249
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:34,599
I'm a private eye.

250
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:37,999
"Tohru Amuro (29)" -A detective.

251
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:40,235
Detective?

252
00:12:40,322 --> 00:12:42,322
A detective.

253
00:12:42,322 --> 00:12:44,222
Isn't it strange?

254
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,122
Why would a detective that is hired by Hatsune

255
00:12:46,122 --> 00:12:49,022
coincidentally be working at a restaurant that Hatsune and I

256
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:51,522
are holding our wedding party?

257
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:53,422
It's not a coincidence.

258
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:57,922
I had her choose this restaurant to hold the wedding party

259
00:12:57,922 --> 00:13:00,822
after I got hired to work here part-time.

260
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,922
But, why on earth?

261
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:07,022
Of course to keep an eye on your actions.

262
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:08,422
To keep an eye on me?

263
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:11,422
Yes, that's what Hatsune asked me to do.

264
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:13,022
She wanted me to check if you,

265
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:14,822
who had a habit of flirting had any other lover

266
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:16,422
and wanted me to keep an eye on you.

267
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:20,622
That's why I deliberately smeared your pants with the cake.

268
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:22,922
So that no other women would approach you.

269
00:13:22,922 --> 00:13:27,922
Even if I wanted to prove that she had asked me to do all this,

270
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:31,422
since Hatsune seems to have burned to death

271
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:33,522
in the parking lot of this restaurant.

272
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:37,522
However the fact that I was hired by her,

273
00:13:37,522 --> 00:13:39,022
can probably be proven

274
00:13:39,022 --> 00:13:41,522
by that man wearing sunglasses over there, correct?

275
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:44,122
It seems that he was around when I was reporting

276
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:48,222
what I found out about Mr. Banba's surrounding to Hatsune.

277
00:13:48,222 --> 00:13:50,222
Who on earth are you?

278
00:13:50,222 --> 00:13:51,222
Well...

279
00:13:51,222 --> 00:13:54,122
He's probably a detective too.

280
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:55,522
A detective?

281
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:59,522
The one who hired him is the groom, Mr. Banba.

282
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:02,222
He probably asked him to check on Hatsune

283
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:04,622
because she seems to be going with somebody recently.

284
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:07,622
Although he was able to catch her secretly meeting someone,

285
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:10,222
since the guy she was seeing was wearing a cap and a hood,

286
00:14:10,222 --> 00:14:11,922
he couldn't figure out what the man looked like.

287
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:14,922
But since the voice of the of the man

288
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:17,322
that he heard then sounded like that of the waiter,

289
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:19,822
he called me to the table to place his order.

290
00:14:19,822 --> 00:14:22,622
After confirming my voice matched that of the man,

291
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:24,822
he probably sent a signal to Mr. Banba

292
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:28,122
that the man and I were one and the same.

293
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:29,722
He called Mr. Banba on the cell phone

294
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:32,622
and got him to come to the men's room,

295
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,222
to tell him that the man in question

296
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:38,022
is probably in this restaurant so he would check from now.

297
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:39,122
Isn't that right?

298
00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:41,422
Yeah, that's right.

299
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,822
I had no idea that you were a detective.

300
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:47,722
You got away each time I tailed you too, so...

301
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,422
But, Mr. Banba,

302
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:53,622
did you still want to marry her

303
00:14:53,622 --> 00:14:56,322
knowing that she was going out with some mysterious man?

304
00:14:56,322 --> 00:14:58,422
I think it's more natural to go ask her yourself, no?

305
00:14:58,422 --> 00:14:59,822
The detective told me

306
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:03,022
that she hasn't been seeing the guy after that secret meeting,

307
00:15:03,022 --> 00:15:06,922
and besides, I thought that she'd hate me if she found out

308
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:09,522
that I hired a detective to check on her.

309
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:11,022
We were so close that even disclosed to each other

310
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:13,222
that we were both foster children too so...

311
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:14,722
So, that's what Mr. Banba meant

312
00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:16,922
when he said they came from the same surroundings...

313
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:18,622
If you hired me,

314
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:20,122
I would've seen through immediately that this slip of a boy

315
00:15:20,122 --> 00:15:22,522
was a detective right away.

316
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,122
How could I have asked you!

317
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:26,522
You're famous and everybody knows what you look like.

318
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:29,622
And besides, I was going to introduce you to her later anyway.

319
00:15:29,622 --> 00:15:32,222
But, if you let me handle it,

320
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,822
maybe she wouldn't have committed suicide either.

321
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:39,422
Maybe she set fire to the car she was inside

322
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:41,422
because this guy kept reporting to her

323
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:43,222
on the phone about all the misconduct

324
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:44,722
we were displaying at this restaurant.

325
00:15:44,722 --> 00:15:47,522
I... I made no such phone call to her.

326
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:51,122
Besides, he was drunk and just frolicking,

327
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:53,022
so even if I did report all of that on the phone,

328
00:15:53,022 --> 00:15:54,622
it's unthinkable that it would lead her to commit suicide.

329
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:56,322
Talking of phone calls...

330
00:15:56,322 --> 00:16:01,822
Mr. Banba, you called her just before the car caught fire

331
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:05,322
and received a message hinting that she would be committing suicide.

332
00:16:05,322 --> 00:16:08,322
Yes, she was crying as she said "Goodbye".

333
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:10,022
I see.

334
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:11,422
If you doubt me...

335
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:15,222
See, tonight at 8:54 pm.

336
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:17,122
The call history is right here, isn't it?

337
00:16:17,122 --> 00:16:18,422
Please let me take a look at it.

338
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:22,122
What time did you contact the police?

339
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:25,722
Well... 9:21 pm.

340
00:16:25,722 --> 00:16:28,422
There seems to be close to a 30 minute time difference.

341
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:29,722
How should I know!

342
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,322
That...

343
00:16:31,322 --> 00:16:33,522
I'm the one who made the call.

344
00:16:33,522 --> 00:16:36,122
It took me some time because I was making calls for an ambulance

345
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:37,922
and to the fire department too.

346
00:16:37,922 --> 00:16:41,422
But, by the time the ambulance and all got here,

347
00:16:41,422 --> 00:16:43,222
it seems that it was burning so bad

348
00:16:43,222 --> 00:16:45,522
that much couldn't be done at that point already.

349
00:16:45,522 --> 00:16:47,922
But, isn't it strange?

350
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:50,622
Normally the place where people get into the car

351
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:52,922
is made with burn proof materials,

352
00:16:52,922 --> 00:16:54,922
and yet, why was it burned so badly?

353
00:16:54,922 --> 00:16:56,022
That's true.

354
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:58,322
It seems to have exploded on and off too.

355
00:16:58,322 --> 00:17:01,322
Oh, it's because of the spray can.

356
00:17:01,322 --> 00:17:03,522
There were a lot of spray cans and paper

357
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,822
in the car and those things caught fire, that's why.

358
00:17:06,822 --> 00:17:09,022
Why were things like that in the car?

359
00:17:09,022 --> 00:17:13,622
We were going to spray the car placing a pattern on it

360
00:17:13,622 --> 00:17:16,422
and decorate the car after the party.

361
00:17:16,422 --> 00:17:18,022
We were going to go to the wedding hall

362
00:17:18,022 --> 00:17:20,322
in the car that we decorated

363
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:22,922
and surprise everybody.

364
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:25,322
If you think I'm lying look at my mail.

365
00:17:25,322 --> 00:17:29,122
I received mail from her that she got all the stuff together.

366
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:35,822
You seemed to have received mail from her at 8:18 pm

367
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:38,022
saying that she'd be returning in 30 minutes.

368
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:42,622
Yes. She sent me a photo mail from the nail salon.

369
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:44,522
Which means...

370
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:48,722
That you knew she had a lot of easily burnable items in her car

371
00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:53,922
as well as the time she would be coming back to this restaurant, no?

372
00:17:55,922 --> 00:17:57,222
Hey.

373
00:17:57,222 --> 00:17:59,022
What the heck are you getting at?

374
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:02,422
In other words, you could've secretly left the restaurant,

375
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:05,422
ambush her at the parking lot pass her out,

376
00:18:05,422 --> 00:18:09,122
shove her into the car, set fire to it and burn her to death!

377
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,522
Hey, hey, hey.

378
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,722
Moreover, near the car,

379
00:18:11,722 --> 00:18:16,722
the fake nail that she just got put on this evening was found,

380
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,422
and on the tip of that fake nail,

381
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:20,522
a tiny portion of skin was found.

382
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:21,922
Hey...

383
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:25,022
From the circumstances, it's most likely

384
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:27,522
that this skin adhered to the tip of the nail

385
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:30,722
when she resisted by scratching when she was attacked.

386
00:18:30,722 --> 00:18:34,722
The DNA of that skin virtually matched the DNA that was collected

387
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:37,922
from the hair of your hairbrush.

388
00:18:37,922 --> 00:18:41,522
But, it wasn't a perfect match, was it?

389
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:44,922
Hey! You tell him something too, Mouri!

390
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:46,822
"Virtually" I think means...

391
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:49,122
that the skin that was found on the fake nail

392
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:51,322
was contaminated by rain and dirt,

393
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:54,822
therefore, a perfect data couldn't be taken.

394
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:56,122
Unless you're blood-related,

395
00:18:56,122 --> 00:18:58,622
a perfect match of the genome genetic information

396
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:00,022
is virtually impossible.

397
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:02,322
Taking this into consideration...

398
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:05,922
It's more natural to think that the DNA...

399
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:08,722
is one of the same person.

400
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:10,922
Why you?

401
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:16,022
No violence please.

402
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,822
Mr. Mouri, please stop him.

403
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:19,622
I don't want him punching me again.

404
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:22,022
It's not necessary.

405
00:19:22,022 --> 00:19:25,022
-Darn. -Hey, Banba, cool it.

406
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:27,522
It hasn't been concluded yet

407
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:30,122
that the hair on your hairbrush is yours yet.

408
00:19:30,122 --> 00:19:32,222
Why don't you let them check your DNA

409
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:34,122
and get accurate test results.

410
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,222
-Just as I thought. -They're just going to get some DNA sample

411
00:19:36,222 --> 00:19:38,122
-If I remember correctly... -from your mouth and check it.

412
00:19:38,122 --> 00:19:40,022
Then, how did he...

413
00:19:40,022 --> 00:19:41,222
Okay, then, Mr. Banba.

414
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:46,122
You agree to take the DNA test, correct?

415
00:19:46,122 --> 00:19:47,122
Yeah.

416
00:19:47,122 --> 00:19:48,622
Please come this way then.

417
00:19:53,722 --> 00:19:55,322
But,

418
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:57,922
DNA test is really something, isn't it?

419
00:19:57,922 --> 00:20:02,122
In the past, all we could get from saliva was the blood type and yet,

420
00:20:02,122 --> 00:20:05,122
today you can tell who it really belongs to.

421
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,722
Yes, I guess so.

422
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:09,522
Then, you'd be able to disclose

423
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:11,322
the real identity of anyone under disguise.

424
00:20:12,322 --> 00:20:14,522
Yes, I guess so.

425
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:19,622
Everything will come to light after the results are out but...

426
00:20:19,622 --> 00:20:21,822
If he were to be the culprit,

427
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:24,622
why would something like that be left behind?

428
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:27,222
Or, is there some trick involved here?

429
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:31,822
If so, why doesn't he say anything about it?

430
00:21:56,322 --> 00:21:57,322
Inspector Megure.

431
00:21:58,522 --> 00:22:01,322
There's one door at the back of this restaurant

432
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:04,122
that leads to the parking lot.

433
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:08,222
But, since it was raining hard when the incident occurred,

434
00:22:08,222 --> 00:22:10,222
that door seemed to have been locked.

435
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:11,722
Which means in order to get out of the restaurant,

436
00:22:11,722 --> 00:22:14,922
there was no other way than to go through the front entrance?

437
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:16,022
Yes.

438
00:22:16,022 --> 00:22:20,222
But if so, I'm sure that one of the guests would've remembered.

439
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:22,722
Are there no other way in and out of the restaurant?

440
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:25,822
You could try to make it out of the window of the toilet.

441
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:28,322
But, outside the window the road is not paved

442
00:22:28,322 --> 00:22:30,622
and there's a big puddle,

443
00:22:30,622 --> 00:22:32,022
so if anyone did pass through here,

444
00:22:32,022 --> 00:22:36,322
there should be some traces of footprints left behind.

445
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:40,222
At the time of the incident, it seems to have been windy,

446
00:22:40,222 --> 00:22:42,722
because Hatsune's umbrella was found

447
00:22:42,722 --> 00:22:45,422
blown to the very end of the parking lot.

448
00:22:45,422 --> 00:22:46,922
Wind?

449
00:22:46,922 --> 00:22:49,322
Come to think of it,

450
00:22:49,322 --> 00:22:51,822
when we got to this restaurant it was pretty windy.

451
00:22:51,822 --> 00:22:57,022
And? Do you detectives have anything that comes to mind?

452
00:22:57,022 --> 00:22:58,322
Not in particular.

453
00:22:58,322 --> 00:23:01,522
When I told him that she was secretly seeing some other man,

454
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:03,522
he was quite out of sorts

455
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:05,522
but recently it seems that he was more concerned

456
00:23:05,522 --> 00:23:09,222
about the fact that she was secretly talking to somebody over the phone.

457
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:13,422
Well, but she was only probably contacting this guy.

458
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:18,222
Oh, no. I contacted her only by mail.

459
00:23:18,222 --> 00:23:20,022
The only time I met her outside was just once,

460
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:21,822
the time you saw her with me.

461
00:23:21,822 --> 00:23:26,322
Only there was just one time when her face clouded.

462
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,022
-Her face clouded? -Yes.

463
00:23:29,022 --> 00:23:30,722
I'm a detective so,

464
00:23:30,722 --> 00:23:34,022
I was checking in detail on Banba.

465
00:23:34,022 --> 00:23:37,322
Then I found out about something.

466
00:23:37,322 --> 00:23:38,922
Found out about something?

467
00:23:38,922 --> 00:23:42,922
He and Hatsune were both rescued from a hotel fire.

468
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,122
Although both their identities weren't known,

469
00:23:45,122 --> 00:23:47,822
they were raised in the same church.

470
00:23:53,322 --> 00:23:54,922
Which means that...

471
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:57,522
You who mistook me, a detective that was hired by Hatsune,

472
00:23:57,522 --> 00:24:00,022
for her lover,

473
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:03,222
shoved her into the car and burned her to death.

474
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:05,022
Why you...

475
00:24:05,022 --> 00:24:08,522
If so, you're not the culprit.

476
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:11,222
If it's just as I've deducted...

477
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:15,122
the sad truth that you didn't want to know about

478
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:17,122
will be exposed in broad daylight.

479
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,722
Next Conan,

480
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:22,622
"Wedding Eve (Part 2)".
