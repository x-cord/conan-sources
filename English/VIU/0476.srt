Summer shines but only yesterday.

2
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:06,147
You cry and cry, soccer ball is always there for you.

3
00:00:06,147 --> 00:00:07,647
Genta kicks the ball out of rage.

4
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:09,547
Yet it leads to the goal of a criminal case.

5
00:00:09,547 --> 00:00:10,947
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,947 --> 00:00:12,647
A child in appearance with the IQ of an adult.

7
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:15,047
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

"Tokyo Spirits 3-3 Big Osaka"

9
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,960
Hide has failed.

10
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
Tokyo Spirits has lost the quarter final

11
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,660
of the Sunday Cup in a penalty shootout.

12
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,860
Now, they're gone!

"Genta's Knockout Shot (Part 1)"

14
00:03:09,452 --> 00:03:11,852
Alright, let's go and eat cake.

15
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:16,867
Come on.

16
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:00,367
Come on!

17
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:03,567
Now, you guys are going to eat the famous cheesecake.

18
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:05,967
So, no more sighs like that, ok?

19
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:07,567
Games are like a roll of the dice.

20
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:09,967
Sometimes, when they lose, they lose.

21
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,667
But still.

22
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:14,567
I can't believe Hide missed his penalty kick.

23
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:17,067
Maybe he was out of condition.

24
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,567
I don't think so.

25
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:22,767
In that game, Hide got one goal, two assists.

26
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:25,667
He must've been in the best condition.

27
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,067
What I'm trying to say is, he's also a son of a man.

28
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,667
Sometimes, he buckles under the pressure.

29
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:33,167
He's a coward, isn't he?

30
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,367
I don't think so.

31
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:39,967
This superstar that people called a treasure of Italian football,

32
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:47,067
said "Only those who have the courage to take a penalty, miss them!"

33
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,667
Yeah, that's right!

34
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:51,567
We take it for granted that penalty kicks are always in and never missed!

35
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:54,267
Hide was not a coward!

36
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:00,167
But you know,

37
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,567
we had Hide and Naoki, right?

38
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:06,467
Tokyo Spirits was winning six games in a row.

39
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,867
They were in really good condition!

40
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:11,067
How could they lose!

41
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:15,067

Oh, I'm sorry.

45
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:26,167
He is upset because his favorite soccer team just lost a game.

46
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:27,667
Be careful!

47
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:31,667
Hey, where did the ball go?

48
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,967
I don't know. Don't ask me!

49
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,567

Who the heck are you, old man?

55
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:55,167
I'm just looking for a kid who kicked this soccer ball

56
00:05:55,167 --> 00:06:00,167
and accidentally cause a damage to my lovely car.

57
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,567
I'm just an unlucky foreigner.

58
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:05,567
Oh, I'm so sorry about that.

59
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,867
Here.

60
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,467
It's no problem! Don't you worry about it!

61
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:15,667
Mister, your Japanese is really good for foreigner!

62
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,267
Sure. My wife is Japanese.

63
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,167
When I fall in love,

64
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:24,267
I love not only that person but also that person's language too.

65
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,867
Actually, I divorced once already.

66
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:30,867
Now I can speak three different languages thanks to that.

67
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:32,567
Really?

68
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:36,767
"Batsuichi"? He's been totally Japanized.

69
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:40,067
Okay, we gotta go to the shop now.

70
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,067
Otherwise, the cheesecake will be all gone!

71
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:45,967
Oh, yeah! You're right!

72
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:47,767
What? Cake?

73
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:50,367
You mean the cake shop called "Ikenaka"

74
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,467
on the second floor here, right?

75
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:55,367
Actually, I came here to buy their cheesecake

76
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:58,767
because my wife loves them!

77
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:00,467
Second floor?

78
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:03,667
That store is on the third floor, I think.

79
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,867
Yeah, that's right. Third floor.

80
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:12,467
Hello?

81
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:15,467
You're always like this.

82
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:20,267
Well... It was from my ex-wife.

83
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:22,867
She called me about our son's academic future

84
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,967
but the reception was bad here.

85
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:27,067
If that's a serious topic to discuss,

86
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:30,467
maybe you should meet and talk to her.

87
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:34,167
No. It's not that easy to do it.

88
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:38,367
Because your ex-wife is in England.

89
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:39,967
How did you know that?

90
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:45,767
The "the strong one doesn't win, the one who wins is strong"

91
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:48,267
was mentioned by Franz Beckenbauer,

92
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,767
the emperor of German football!

93
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:54,667
You must be German because you not only like the words

94
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,067
but also are proud of them, right?

95
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:58,167
Yes.

96
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:02,567
The three languages you can speak include German, Japanese,

97
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,567
and English as you spoke some English words.

98
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,667
Your present wife is Japanese,

99
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:10,367
then your ex-wife would've been someone who could speak English.

100
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:14,367
But, she could've been American since they spoke English, right?

101
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:16,567
I got it.

102
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:18,767
It was the word, "second floor" wasn't it?

103
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:21,767
In America, you say "third floor",

104
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,267
but in England, you say "second floor".

105
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:27,867
What do mean? Second means 2, isn't it?

106
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:31,167
English people call the first floor as ground floor.

107
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:36,867
Above the ground floor is the "first floor", "second" and "third"!

108
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:42,067
That's why I thought your ex-wife was English.

109
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:46,767
That kid, is he really a kid?

110
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:49,267
What? Well...

111
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:52,867
Well, do you want us to go and buy cake for you?

112
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:55,067
That would be great,

113
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:59,467
because it looks like I have to call her back and talk for a while.

114
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:02,667
Can you get a whole cheesecake for me, please?

115
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,667
Sure.

116
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:06,067
We are going to eat inside the cake shop,

117
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,967
so I think it's going to take a while.

118
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:11,467
Alright, let's go now!

119
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,667
I'm not going.

120
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:15,267
-What? -We are going to eat!

121
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:18,467
Tokyo Spirits lost the game.

122
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,767
I can't eat cake!

123
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,167
Genta?

124
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:24,267
You guys go and eat!

125
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:26,567
I am not in the mood!

126
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,867
Alright, then. Leave him alone.

127
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:33,467
We don't wanna eat with someone who's grouchy.

128
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:36,067
Haibara.

129
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:39,567
Alright, then. You wait silently in the car.

130
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:42,767
Oh, okay.

131
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,067
What's wrong?

132
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:59,167
Aren't you eating? It's amazing!

133
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:00,367
Well...

134
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:04,067
I'm thinking about Genta. You know.

135
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:06,667
Come on, don't worry about him.

136
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,667
He'll be okay.

137
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,767
The takeout is ready.

138
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:12,867
Yes, here.

139
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:15,467
Sorry to keep you waiting.

140
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:19,167
This big box is the whole cake for the foreigner.

141
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:22,867
And as you know, this small one is for Genta!

142
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:28,167
It's yummy!

143
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:32,967
It's yummy, isn't it?

144
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:44,567
I'm the one... I'm gonna be the one to change the team.

145
00:10:56,267 --> 00:11:00,767
I'm gonna be a much better player than Hide and Naoki

146
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:04,767
and make Tokyo Spirits, an invincible team.

147
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,267
What? Oh, shoot!

148
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,867
Once Genta eats this cake,

149
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:14,867
he will get over his bad mood for sure!

150
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:16,367
I'll bet!

151
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:21,467
-No! -Oh no.

152
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:31,567
I'm so sorry! I was kind of in a hurry.

153
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:38,667
That was dangerous!

154
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:41,567
I hope the cake is okay.

155
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,767
Driving license?

156
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:45,767
"Hiromasa Inagaki (35)"

157
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:48,867
This guy was him?

158
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:51,567
Hey, what's taking you so long?

159
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:55,967
Ouch...

160
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:59,667
Oh, yeah. I tripped and hit my head.

161
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:02,367
How long will it take you to fix it, man?

162
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:03,767
I'm sorry, sir.

163
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:06,067
This machine has been acting up recently...

164
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:08,667
"Tatsuzo Genda (44)" -Hey, I'm gonna break the gate bar

165
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:10,167
if you don't fix it soon.

166
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,567
You hear me, man?

167
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:13,567
I'm doing my best.

168
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,767
Ouch...

169
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,767
Where's the ball?

170
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:20,167
I overdid it.

171
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,167
There it is!

172
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:26,467
There you are.

173
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:36,767
Legs?

174
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:40,467
You should go somewhere else or you are gonna catch cold.

175
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:53,567
Genta!

176
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:00,801
Genta!

177
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:02,501
Hey! Where are you, Genta?

178
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:04,501
What happened, Genta?

179
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:06,101
Genta!

180
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:07,301
Kojima!

181
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:12,901
I found him! He's here!!

182
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:16,301
He's dead...

183
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:17,801
Genta, what happened?

184
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:19,601
The...

185
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:23,101
The foreign man is lying there dead!

186
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:24,301
What?

187
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:32,001
No.

188
00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:34,201
Although weakly, he is still breathing.

189
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:36,601
Doc! Please call the ambulance and the police!

190
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:37,801
I got it!

191
00:13:37,801 --> 00:13:39,501
Hey! What happened?

192
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:41,101
Who did this to you?

193
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:45,501
Wait!

194
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:47,101
Looks like the injury on his left front forehead

195
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:49,101
is causing him unable to process words.

196
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:51,101
He couldn't speak too.

197
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:03,301
Criminal.

198
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:08,901
Me? Is that me?

199
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:10,601
No way!

200
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:11,801
Wait a sec!

201
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:14,101
Probably, he is pointing

202
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:16,801
at something that's behind Genta.

203
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:21,001
It might be some kind of clue telling us about the suspect.

204
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:24,901
So, if I move Genta like this,

205
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:27,701
he will show us what that is.

206
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,001
What?

207
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:33,001
After all, it was still me!

208
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,301
E...

209
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:41,401
E...

210
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:43,501
El...

211
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:44,501
No way.

212
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:47,901
Mister! Don't die!

213
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:51,201
Don't you worry! He just lost his consciousness,

214
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:53,701
though he's still in critical condition.

215
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:55,301
Well, that aside,

216
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:58,701
why did he point at Kojima?

217
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:02,401
Genta, didn't you see the suspect

218
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,401
before you found this man bleeding?

219
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:07,101
Maybe that's why he pointed at you.

220
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:10,201
No, I didn't.

221
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:14,401
Because I was stunned when I heard this weird noise.

222
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,401
I missed kicking the ball,

223
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:22,701
tripped and hit my head.

224
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:25,601
I was unconscious for a long time.

225
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:29,601
You were kicking the soccer ball in this parking lot?

226
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:31,401
Yes, I did.

227
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:34,401
That's some dangerous thing you did.

228
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,401
Then, when you woke up,

229
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:38,501
he was here like this, correct?

230
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:40,901
Well, I was looking for the soccer ball,

231
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:44,901
and I found it by that foreign man.

232
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,801
Then, it maybe possible that

233
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:50,001
the ball you kicked struck this man's head?

234
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:55,001
Maybe that was why he said the word "criminal" to you.

235
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:56,301
What are you, stupid?

236
00:15:56,301 --> 00:16:00,001
How could a kid's shot injure an adult like this?

237
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:05,701
But Conan's shots always blow criminals away, don't they?

238
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:08,901
Conan's shots are specials.

239
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:12,901
He's using machines. It's all fake!

240
00:16:12,901 --> 00:16:15,901
Fake, huh?

241
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:17,501
Well, anyway,

242
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:19,701
it's worth believing that Genta is holding some clue

243
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:20,901
to find the criminal!

244
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:24,501
We are going find out who that is.

245
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:27,901
So don't worry about anything, Genta.

246
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:31,401
I am the criminal...

247
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:34,001
Right. He's not listening.

248
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:38,101
The victim was Mr. Rutger Heinen.

249
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:39,601
He's German.

250
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:42,601
He works for a German sports goods manufacturer

251
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,801
and was sent to Japan.

252
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:48,701
He was attacked with the steel pipe that was on ground.

253
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:50,801
According to the wounds,

254
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,401
it seems his head was hit twice,

255
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,901
one in the back and one in the front.

256
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:57,001
So, how's the victim's condition?

257
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:58,601
He was sent to a hospital,

258
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,901
but he's still unconscious.

259
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:04,101
I thought he might've seen the criminal's face

260
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:07,001
if he was attacked from the front.

261
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:09,801
This is Mr. Rutger's car.

262
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:12,801
Perhaps, he was waiting for somebody here.

263
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:16,201
As he got out of the car to talk to this person,

264
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,401
the criminal attacked him.

265
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:21,101
You are saying, resentment is the motive?

266
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:22,601
Yes, probably.

267
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:26,901
I found it his wallet in his jacket with plenty of money in it.

268
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:28,501
It left untouched,

269
00:17:28,501 --> 00:17:30,801
so I don't think money was the motive in this case.

270
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,301
Okay. Then you go to where he's working,

271
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:34,801
and look for the criminal.

272
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:35,901
Yes, sir!

273
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:39,201
It... it was me.

274
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:42,501
It was me...

275
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,001
Genta?

276
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:45,901
What the heck are you doing here?

277
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,501
It was me who did that to that foreigner...

278
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:54,601
Well, actually he was the first to find him!

279
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:57,301
He found the foreigner lying there bleeding.

280
00:17:57,301 --> 00:17:58,501
That's right!

281
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:01,801
Really. You guys again?

282
00:18:03,401 --> 00:18:05,901
We came here to eat cheesecake

283
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:09,001
and we happened to get to know Mr. Rutger.

284
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,401
Oh, Mr. Agasa.

285
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:12,001
He asked us to buy the cake for him.

286
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:16,201
So we came back with his cake, Genta stayed in the parking lot,

287
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:20,501
and found Mr. Rutger lying here injured.

288
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:24,301
So, Genta, did you see anybody suspicious?

289
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:26,401
No... I was...

290
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:28,601
We didn't see anybody suspicious

291
00:18:28,601 --> 00:18:31,401
but I think money was involved in this case.

292
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,401
What?

293
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:36,501
But Detective Takagi said that the wallet was left untouched.

294
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:40,101
Alright, why don't you take a look inside Mr. Rutger's car?

295
00:18:41,201 --> 00:18:43,201
You see the coins?

296
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:44,501
Yeah, I see them.

297
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:47,801
They are scattered over the passenger's seat.

298
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:50,701
So, why was money involved?

299
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:55,701
Actually, I checked inside the car before you came

300
00:18:55,701 --> 00:19:00,401
and I found out that there was no parking ticket!

301
00:19:00,401 --> 00:19:01,601
What?

302
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:05,201
Inspector, where do you usually keep your parking ticket?

303
00:19:05,201 --> 00:19:07,701
Let's see.

304
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:09,601
Parking ticket, right?

305
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:13,201
In the glove compartment, the pocket of my pants

306
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:14,201
or in the wallet or...

307
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:16,501
I got it. It's the coin purse!

308
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:18,401
The criminal took the coin purse

309
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:22,301
with the parking ticket in it and ran away!

310
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:23,601
I see.

311
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:27,301
The coin purse on the passenger's seat was left open,

312
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:30,601
and some of the coins dropped when the criminal took it away.

313
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:32,301
Without even checking the wallet

314
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:35,401
that was full of money in the pocket though?

315
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:37,501
Yeah, because the criminal was feeling so pressed

316
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:39,501
that he couldn't even search around.

317
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:40,801
Thus, the criminal just took what was in sight,

318
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:42,201
which was the coin purse!

319
00:19:42,201 --> 00:19:44,001
Feeling so pressed?

320
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:46,301
Yes. Maybe.

321
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:48,601
Perhaps, right after beating Mr. Rutger up,

322
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:53,501
then the soccer ball Genta kicked came rolling by the car.

323
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:55,001
The criminal must've thought that it would be dangerous

324
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:57,401
because someone might come over and get the ball.

325
00:19:57,401 --> 00:19:59,601
Well, by the sound of Mr. Rutger being hit,

326
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:02,901
the person who kicked the ball was actually stunned tripped,

327
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:06,301
hit his head on the ground and lost consciousness.

328
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:11,101
Actually, it's bad news that the criminal is a robber, isn't it?

329
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:12,201
True.

330
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:15,701
We have to do investigations to get testimony from witnesses.

331
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:17,801
No.

332
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,701
There are only three people who are suspicious.

333
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:21,801
What?

334
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:25,601
It seems Mr. Rutger was talking to his ex-wife on the phone

335
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:28,801
while we were buying the cake.

336
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:30,801
But the reception was bad,

337
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:33,501
so he called her back again and again.

338
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:37,301
And the very last call was made four minutes

339
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:39,501
before we came back here!

340
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:43,801
That means, the incident occurred within these four minutes, right?

341
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:45,401
Yes.

342
00:20:45,401 --> 00:20:47,601
Then, we need the one who was stranded

343
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:50,901
because of the accident at the entrance gate.

344
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:54,001
And the one who is still in his car.

345
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:56,701
And the one who we saw in front of the elevator

346
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:58,201
connecting the parking lot and the building

347
00:20:58,201 --> 00:21:00,901
when we came back to the parking lot.

348
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:09,601
I'm so sorry! I was kind of in a hurry.

349
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:12,501
He also dropped his driving license.

350
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:13,501
It's this guy.

351
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:17,501
"Driving license" -They are the three suspects!

352
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:19,601
Really?

353
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,801
I see. Three people, right?

354
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:23,601
Alright, Takagi!

355
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:25,401
You search for these two men in this parking lot,

356
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:27,401
and also the man with this driving license.

357
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:29,101
And get them over here, got it?

358
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:31,001
Yes, sir! Understood.

359
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:36,601
The one who has the coin purse is the...

360
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:40,501
He would throw the purse away if he finds that there are only coins.

361
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:43,201
-What? -But, don't worry!

362
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,901
Mr. Rutger left us a hint.

363
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:48,301
A hint?

364
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:50,301
Before he fainted,

365
00:21:50,301 --> 00:21:53,201
Mr. Rutger pointed his finger at Genta.

366
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:55,201
Saying "criminal".

367
00:21:55,201 --> 00:21:56,501
He said that to you?

368
00:21:56,501 --> 00:22:02,101
Yes. It's me, was it?

369
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:06,001
And he grabbed my shoulder and said "El".

370
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:11,801
E...

371
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:16,001
El...

372
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,201
That means, the criminal is someone

373
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:20,301
that has something in common with Genta,

374
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:24,501
and someone who has something to do with the word "El".

375
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:55,701
Elf?

376
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:58,201
You know the pixies in the fantasy stories.

377
00:23:58,201 --> 00:24:00,001
Asking for a small favor.

378
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:03,901
Then, this boy must have done it.

379
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:06,001
Genta didn't do anything!

380
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:10,501
So it was by someone acting like a pesky kid, just like Genta.

381
00:24:10,501 --> 00:24:12,101
-I got it! -What?

382
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:13,901
The person who attacked Mr. Rutger is...

383
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:18,801
I see. It was like that.

384
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:24,101
Next Conan, "Genta's Knockout Shot (Part 2)"

385
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:42,201
Next Conan's Hint:

386
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:44,201
"Pesky Kid"

387
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:46,301
I'll be a good kid, so...

388
00:24:46,301 --> 00:24:47,701
Well, you didn't do anything, Genta.

389
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:49,101
So please, don't take eels away from me!
