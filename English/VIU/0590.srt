1
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:06,109
Found within Pop's wallet

2
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:09,109
was a receipt for a 50,000-yen necklace.

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:13,209
It seemed to be a birthday present for Ran's mother,

4
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:16,709
Attorney Kisaki, who was born on October 10th.

5
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:20,209
After learning of that, Ran displayed her tremendous lottery luck

6
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:23,109
and won tickets for a hotel stay.

7
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:31,009
As a result, we ended up enjoying a fancy dinner in a seaside hotel,

8
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:33,809
but Pops didn't seem to plan to give her the present

9
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,409
and even got drunk and fell asleep.

10
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:40,009
Attorney Kisaki who was upset went back to her room.

11
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:45,609
Just before midnight and the end of the birthday,

12
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:49,909
Ran tried to get Pops to deliver his present at any cost.

13
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:52,309
But soon after we barged into the room,

14
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:56,009
we discovered a murdered female body.

15
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:02,209
That woman was Mrs. Akiho Kokubu, a client of Attorney Kisaki

16
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:04,209
who had a stalker problem and was in the process

17
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,809
"Akiho Kobuku (28), Client" -of settling the case out of court.

18
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:10,709
The body wasn't there when Attorney Kisaki returned to her room,

19
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,709
but it appeared out of nowhere while she was taking a shower.

20
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:19,109
Looks like the culprit moved the bed

21
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:21,809
and hid under it along with the body.

22
00:01:22,809 --> 00:01:24,609
Accompanied by Inspector Yokomizo,

23
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:30,709
we began questioning all of the hotel guests in connection to Akiho.

24
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:52,809
Brooding over passing seasons

25
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:54,809
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

26
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:56,809
Fulfill Ran's wish, Pops.

27
00:01:56,809 --> 00:01:58,709
Make great deductions once in a while without going to sleep.

28
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:00,409
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,309
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:04,509
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

31
00:03:28,272 --> 00:03:31,572
"The Worst Birthday (Part 2)"

32
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:36,375
My wife was murdered?

33
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,975
Who... Who did it? And why?

34
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:41,775
We're currently investigating that.

35
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:46,175
But why didn't you pick your wife up?

36
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:48,475
"Takehiko Kokubu (30)" -I did call

37
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:49,875
"Akiho's Husband" -and say I'd pick her up,

38
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:53,175
but she bellowed that she wouldn't let me in even if I came over.

39
00:03:53,175 --> 00:03:55,575
What was the cause of your argument?

40
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:57,375
Well, it was...

41
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,375
Was it about this?

42
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,475
It's a bunch of mini cars.

43
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:05,775
I've loved cars since I was a kid,

44
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:07,975
and lining them up helps me feel calm.

45
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:11,575
But how could this have caused the fight?

46
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,175
See.

47
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:16,275
The side mirror was tossed onto the floor.

48
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:20,275
A man who loves cars wouldn't do something this violent, right?

49
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:22,075
So your wife did this?

50
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:25,375
Yeah. She told me to quit this childish and disgusting hobby

51
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,875
and threw it.

52
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:31,175
Sir, which one of these cars is your favorite?

53
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:37,275
It's the beloved car of the legendary actor, James Dean.

54
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:38,975
This Porsche.

55
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,675
That woman was murdered?

56
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:45,275
"Midori Hino (51)" -Well, I always figured...

57
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:47,075
"Opposing Party In The Negotiation" -one of the foolish men she deceived

58
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:50,775
would eventually kill her.

59
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:54,775
On that note, it's my understanding that you called the victim.

60
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:58,775
Yeah, I was calling the attorney to see

61
00:04:58,775 --> 00:05:01,875
if we could slightly change the time of our negotiation tomorrow.

62
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:05,075
But I was shocked when that woman picked up the phone.

63
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:08,575
Why did you wish to change the time?

64
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:13,075
The golf appointment I have with a friend got moved up.

65
00:05:13,075 --> 00:05:15,875
So you plan to play golf soon after

66
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,775
your stalker son's settlement negotiations?

67
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,375
There's another occupant in this room.

68
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,675
What?

69
00:05:21,675 --> 00:05:25,675
There aren't lipstick marks on these cigarette butts.

70
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:30,475
And the filter is still damp.

71
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:32,275
It really is.

72
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,875
Is that right?

73
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:38,275
That's enough, Seiji!

74
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:39,975
Get out here!

75
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,175
"Seiji Hino (26), Hidori's Son" -So that's your stalker son?

76
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:47,775
I told you that my son was only deceived.

77
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:52,475
But you were instructed not to bring your son here, were you not?

78
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:56,175
Well, he happened to be here

79
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:58,875
because he'll be touring with his friends

80
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,075
on their bikes tomorrow morning.

81
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:03,875
Then show us that bike.

82
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,075
Right here.

83
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:09,375
Look.

84
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,875
A road bike?

85
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:17,775
Incidentally, please tell us your whereabouts and what you did

86
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:20,275
between 10:00 pm and 11:00 pm.

87
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:22,275
I was drinking with my mom.

88
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:24,875
If you think we're lying, verify it yourself.

89
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,975
We were at the hotel lounge on the top floor.

90
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,675
It certainly appears that the mother and son

91
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:37,975
were drinking together from 9.00 pm to 12.00 am.

92
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:42,375
Yes, and it seems they both went to the restroom once.

93
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,875
But it was at different times,

94
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,175
so neither of them could have moved the bed.

95
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:49,475
Well, it's getting late now.

96
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,575
Let's continue the investigation at dawn.

97
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:54,775
And where do you propose I should stay?

98
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:57,375
Why don't you just stay in Mr. Mouri's room?

99
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,175
You two are a married couple.

100
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:01,175
I should note that we're living separately.

101
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:08,675
Well, this was inevitable.

102
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:14,175
There's something under the pillow.

103
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,975
A present?

104
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:19,075
Pops had it prepared after all, didn't he?

105
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:22,075
But why didn't he give it to her yesterday, on October 10th?

106
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,875
October 10th is my mom's birthday.

107
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:29,775
I'll win the first place and give her the red ribbon as present!

108
00:07:30,675 --> 00:07:32,775
Don't tell me, Pops...

109
00:07:32,775 --> 00:07:36,175
You can't raise it then lower it.

110
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:40,275
You have to lower the expectation, then raise it for a surprise.

111
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:45,475
Raise and then lower. Lower and then raise?

112
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:54,675
I see, so that's how it was.

113
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:58,875
The culprit utilized that to move the bed easily.

114
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,675
He did it single-handedly without anyone's help.

115
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,775
"October 11th"

116
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,075
Come on, please.

117
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:10,375
We finally had the chance to stay at a hotel as a family,

118
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,575
and this is a buffet.

119
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,775
Why are you sitting at different tables?

120
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:20,275
I was the one who sat down first.

121
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:21,975
Isn't that moustached old man

122
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:24,675
the one who purposely sat at another table?

123
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:29,075
It can't be helped. I have a lot on my mind.

124
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:33,175
Such as how I'm going to prove the innocence of my wife

125
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:35,875
who has become a murder suspect.

126
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,275
Dad!

127
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:39,975
Ran, don't be fooled.

128
00:08:39,975 --> 00:08:42,375
There's no telling what he's up to.

129
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,175
Mom.

130
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,275
He's checking the time.

131
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:51,275
And he's checking the present as well.

132
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:53,475
The moment is approaching.

133
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:57,175
He's suddenly starting to be nice to the recipient.

134
00:08:57,175 --> 00:09:01,275
Well, I might as well put Pops to sleep

135
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,875
and solve this case quickly.

136
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:08,675
Darn it. At such a critical moment,

137
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:13,175
why can't I find the key to solving this case at all?

138
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:14,675
Darn it.

139
00:09:16,175 --> 00:09:19,175
Well, since this special day only comes once a year,

140
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:22,275
I'll let Pops show off this time.

141
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:26,975
It looks like a dish is brought out!

142
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:29,275
-What? -How amazing.

143
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:32,675
Something so heavy is being moved by a single person.

144
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:34,675
It's not amazing.

145
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,075
Since there are wheels on the bottom,

146
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:39,175
it's easy for even a single person to move.

147
00:09:40,675 --> 00:09:42,275
Wheels on the bottom?

148
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:44,775
Hey, what is this?

149
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:47,375
This?

150
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,475
Sausages! They look tasty!

151
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:56,175
Oh, no! The ketchup!

152
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:58,475
Conan! What are you doing?

153
00:09:58,475 --> 00:10:02,075
It's all right. I'll bring another one.

154
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:03,375
Gosh.

155
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:12,775
What is this? The ketchup marks look like dots.

156
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:16,275
Isn't it incredible that the marks are evenly spaced?

157
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:19,875
Idiot! It's nothing incredible at all.

158
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:24,175
The ketchup on the wheels will leave marks on the floor as it rolls,

159
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:27,175
creating evenly spaced marks.

160
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:28,675
Wait a second.

161
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:31,575
Where have I seen this mark before?

162
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,175
I see. So that's what happened!

163
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:47,475
You finally got it.

164
00:10:47,475 --> 00:10:49,975
Ran! Call Yokomizo now!

165
00:10:49,975 --> 00:10:51,175
What?

166
00:10:51,175 --> 00:10:54,875
Have him gather the suspects to the room where the crime took place!

167
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,575
Then, does that mean...

168
00:10:56,575 --> 00:10:59,075
Yeah, I've figured it out.

169
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,375
The trick behind that locked room murder

170
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,575
and the culprit who devised it!

171
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,575
Kogoro Mouri's deduction show is about to begin!

172
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:21,569
Sorry, Mr. Mouri.

173
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:23,869
It took us a while to get here.

174
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:27,169
Because by the time Ran contacted us,

175
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:31,169
the three of them had already checked out of the hotel.

176
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:33,669
So why did you call us here?

177
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:36,969
I thought there wasn't anything left to talk about.

178
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:41,769
I bet they're still suspecting us.

179
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:45,369
What is this about? Don't we have an alibi

180
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:49,269
from 10:00 to 11:00 pm, the supposed time of the crime?

181
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:52,769
My son and I were drinking in the hotel lounge!

182
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:56,269
But it seems you both left to use the restroom once.

183
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:00,269
We went separately! And it was only for about 10 minutes.

184
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:06,169
Besides, the corpse was in the room where that attorney stayed.

185
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:09,669
When the attorney came back at 11:00 pm,

186
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:12,069
the woman's body wasn't there.

187
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:14,669
The body was discovered around midnight

188
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:20,369
after she took a shower and let Detective Mouri enter the room.

189
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:23,569
If that's the case, isn't this a locked room murder?

190
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:25,069
That's true.

191
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:27,269
Since the hotel rooms are auto-locked,

192
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:29,569
you can't get in without a keycard.

193
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:31,869
If my wife was in the room,

194
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:34,269
she could have opened the door for me.

195
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:37,469
But when you returned to the room, my wife wasn't there, right?

196
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:38,469
Yes.

197
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:42,069
No, she was already in the room.

198
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:44,769
I mean your wife. -What?

199
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:48,769
She was already killed and hidden under the bed.

200
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,569
-What? -Under the bed?

201
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:53,169
It can't be.

202
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:57,869
And then the culprit moved the bed when Eri was showering,

203
00:12:57,869 --> 00:13:01,869
disclosed the body, and fled from this room.

204
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:03,769
Moved the bed?

205
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:05,269
But how?

206
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:07,669
Please wait a minute.

207
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:09,069
Is this all right?

208
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:11,169
You're not doing what you usually do.

209
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:14,369
-Usual? -I mean this.

210
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:19,369
Just like that.

211
00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:20,869
What on earth was that?

212
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:22,669
Hey!

213
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,969
Can you tell us how the bed was moved?

214
00:13:25,969 --> 00:13:27,669
That's right.

215
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:32,169
Before I returned to the room, if the culprit killed Akiho,

216
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:35,169
concealed the body under the moved bed,

217
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:37,869
and then hid himself next to the body,

218
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:41,769
he could've made me not notice them when I came in.

219
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:44,669
And while I was showering, it's possible

220
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:48,369
that he moved the bed back to reveal the body

221
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,869
and snuck out of the room.

222
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:56,569
It's a herculean task for a single person to slide a bed that heavy

223
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,169
without leaving drag marks on the carpet.

224
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:01,769
Even if Akiho who was sleeping in my room

225
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:05,469
was killed by her husband, Takehiko,

226
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,169
he would have been by himself when he came to get her.

227
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:12,669
As for the two of you who knew Akiho was in my room,

228
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:16,069
you could've moved the bed by working together.

229
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:17,669
But at the time of crime,

230
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:21,069
there wasn't a moment in which you were both gone,

231
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,269
so that's impossible.

232
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:27,969
Under such circumstances, how was the bed moved and who did it?

233
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:29,669
Mr. Detective.

234
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:32,869
By putting wheels under the bed.

235
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:35,369
-Wheels? -I see!

236
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:38,269
Seiji had a road bike.

237
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:42,269
He must have utilized the bike's tires.

238
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:44,569
Utilized them...

239
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:46,269
How did he do it?

240
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:48,369
It wasn't the bike!

241
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:50,969
Wasn't there someone with toys

242
00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:53,569
that could easily be placed under the bed?

243
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:56,369
By toys, do you mean the mini cars?

244
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:58,169
Yeah, that's right.

245
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:00,569
A single person can lift a bed one corner at a time

246
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:04,169
and place a mini car under each leg.

247
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,669
With wheels under each of the four bed legs,

248
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:11,369
it would be easy for one to slide the bed.

249
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,669
The person who was lining up mini cars in the hotel room

250
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:18,269
was you, Mr. Takehiko!

251
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:21,369
The proof is the small blood tracks

252
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:24,669
that are evenly spaced near the leg of the bed.

253
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:26,569
It's likely that the mini car tires

254
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:31,069
ran over the blood stains on the carpet when you moved the bed.

255
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:35,069
I guess you've already disposed of those mini cars though.

256
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:39,269
But Mr. Mouri, if he had just placed the bed on top of the mini cars,

257
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:43,769
it would have slipped off while it was being moved.

258
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,169
That's true.

259
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:51,069
So it turns out you didn't figure it out, Pops.

260
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:53,669
I don't think a man who likes mini cars so much

261
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:57,269
would do anything like that to damage them.

262
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:02,069
He was so proud of them when he showed them to me yesterday.

263
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:06,069
Sir, which one of these cars is your favorite?

264
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:12,369
It's the beloved car of the legendary actor, James Dean.

265
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:14,569
This Porsche.

266
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:18,869
The car that James Dean drove, the Porsche 911.

267
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:20,869
Porsche 911?

268
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:23,669
But the car that James Dean drove was...

269
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:27,969
The Porsche 550 Spider, a convertible.

270
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:30,869
I see! He could have placed the bed leg

271
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:34,769
into the opening where the seats are.

272
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:38,069
That... That would certainly stabilize it.

273
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:42,669
That's why you couldn't show the 550 Spider to Conan.

274
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,769
It's because the bed leg damaged the seats.

275
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:50,469
But why didn't Mr. Takehiko leave immediately after the murder

276
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:52,169
instead of using that trick?

277
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:55,969
If Eri had discovered the body immediately after returning to the room,

278
00:16:55,969 --> 00:16:58,469
he'd become the first suspect

279
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:02,969
since she had asked him to come and pick the victim up.

280
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:05,769
That's why after killing your wife,

281
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:09,569
you held the door open using a stopper and returned to your room,

282
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:13,469
then came back with your mini cars and deployed the trick, didn't you?

283
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:18,169
You figured that if it seemed like an impossible crime,

284
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:20,069
it would divert attention away from you.

285
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,669
But the trick couldn't be used

286
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:26,169
if the attorney hadn't gone into the bathroom.

287
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:30,169
That's why you were very lucky.

288
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:34,969
But who would wait under the bed with a body on such an off chance?

289
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:36,469
That's true.

290
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:38,969
No one in their right mind would do that.

291
00:17:38,969 --> 00:17:42,169
Encouraged from a few drinks, perhaps?

292
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:43,569
I don't think so.

293
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:46,069
Speaking of drinking,

294
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:48,269
whenever Pops comes home from drinking,

295
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:50,769
he usually shouts something, doesn't he?

296
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,569
"Ran, bring me some water."

297
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:55,469
That's true, but...

298
00:17:55,469 --> 00:17:57,969
Why are you bringing that up now?

299
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:00,869
The reason why one gets thirsty after drinking

300
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:05,369
is that a dehydration reaction occurs as the body breaks down alcohol.

301
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:09,769
You already knew I would come back to the room at around 11:00 pm.

302
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:13,369
You could have assumed that I was going for a drink with someone.

303
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:14,769
That's why...

304
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:19,369
you put only carbonated drinks in my refrigerator

305
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:21,869
and shook up every single can.

306
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,469
That way, when I open it,

307
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:28,269
the content would spray up and force me to take a shower.

308
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:33,969
Well, since we haven't found the murder weapon,

309
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:36,169
why don't we examine

310
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:41,169
the glass ashtray in Room 309 where Takehiko was staying?

311
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:44,769
It seems all of the rooms have those ashtrays.

312
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:47,569
If he took the murder weapon with him

313
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:49,969
to make it seem like an extremely impossible crime,

314
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:54,269
he would have to switch it with the one in his room.

315
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,669
A short while later,

316
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:02,569
luminal reaction test on the ashtray in Room 309 proved positive.

317
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:05,069
It was Akiho's blood.

318
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:08,969
Takehiko also confessed to the crime.

319
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:11,169
The motive was the mini cars.

320
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:13,669
He had heard that Akiho was a former race queen

321
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:15,369
and model who liked mini cars,

322
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:17,669
so they got along well and got married.

323
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:20,969
But last night, she laughed and told him that it was all a lie

324
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:24,869
in order to lure a wealthy man like Takehiko to herself.

325
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:30,469
What pushed him over the edge were her final words.

326
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:35,569
Have you realized the meaning of the birthday present I gave you?

327
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:38,669
Yeah, the 550 Spider?

328
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:42,869
That was the beloved car of a famous movie star, right?

329
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:45,869
It's a car you can't buy unless you're rich, right?

330
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:50,569
In other words, I only married you because of your money.

331
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:53,969
I can't wait to inherit it after your death!

332
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:02,269
That was quite a present, wasn't it?

333
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:05,769
Yeah, I wouldn't want to get something like that.

334
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:10,869
My, my. I think it's better than getting nothing at all.

335
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:13,869
All right, I'll be heading home now.

336
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:16,169
Aren't you going to stay at the hotel?

337
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:17,769
It's already 11:00 pm.

338
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:20,769
It's fine. I've already called a taxi.

339
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:23,569
-See you. -Don't leave.

340
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:28,269
Although there's only an hour left, it's still your birthday.

341
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,769
Why don't the two of us celebrate it?

342
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:33,669
We'll send Ran and the brat off to another room...

343
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:39,369
and relive the time when we were lovers.

344
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:42,369
This is a little something from me.

345
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:46,269
Well, since you're an adult, I guess you won't be thrilled

346
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:48,069
receiving something trivial like a birthday present.

347
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:50,969
Excuse me. Whose birthday is it?

348
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:52,869
Yours, of course!

349
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:55,669
-It's the same day as Sports Day! -What?

350
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:02,269
Speaking of Sports Day, it used to be on October 10th, right?

351
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:06,969
That's right. But now it falls on the second Monday in October.

352
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:08,169
What?

353
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:15,469
Does dad only remembers mom's birthday through Sports Day?

354
00:21:15,469 --> 00:21:17,469
It's because when we were kids,

355
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:19,969
you always said this at the Sports Day event,

356
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:23,569
"Today's my birthday, so I can't lose"!

357
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:26,169
October 10th is usually a bright and sunny day,

358
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:30,269
so schools used to hold their sports event on that day.

359
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:34,969
What is this? I purposely lowered and raised the expectation.

360
00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:36,769
So it was all meaningless?

361
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:38,869
Lowered and then raised it?

362
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:41,369
So that's why you were so cold to mom.

363
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:44,669
You didn't need to lower her expectations.

364
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:50,569
In any case, I'll gladly accept these spoils of war,

365
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:53,469
you dumb detective.

366

"Law Eri Kisaki" -And the next day...

367
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:27,569
Hey.

368
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:31,569
What in the world is this? The content of the present!

369
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:35,369
I thought it was a necklace, but they're prayer beads!

370
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:40,469
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Is that man telling me to die?

371
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:44,469
The manager at Poirot asked dad to buy those prayer beads.

372
00:23:44,469 --> 00:23:47,969
It looks like he brought the wrong thing by mistake.

373
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:55,369
There it is!

374
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:59,769
Pops, that's too big of a mistake.

375
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:05,769
The house of a person who makes aquariums!

376
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:09,169
Awesome!

377
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:12,769
Look at that, Ai. All the pretty fish!

378
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:19,569
As he was drunk, he probably fell asleep while bathing, and drowned.

379
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:22,669
If Mr. Nishida died on Friday night,

380
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,769
it's strange that the glue hasn't dried.
