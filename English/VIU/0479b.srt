1
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,978
"Orange. Pinwheel Room" -I've figured it out completely!

2
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:15,878
"Orange. Pinwheel Room" -You meant that the woman

3
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:18,178
that I saw three days ago and the one I saw tonight were...

4
00:00:18,178 --> 00:00:21,578
Yeah, not an illusion but genuine dead bodies

5
00:00:21,578 --> 00:00:24,878
that were ingeniously hidden and made to look as if they disappeared

6
00:00:24,878 --> 00:00:27,278
using an unimaginable trick.

7
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:28,478
Trick?

8
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:30,778
What kind of trick was it?

9
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:32,478
Please tell us, dad!

10
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:37,578
The hint is this pinwheel! This brought everything to light!

11
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:39,578
You thought so too, didn't you?

12
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:41,178
Osaka kid.

13
00:00:41,178 --> 00:00:43,678
Yeah.

14
00:00:43,678 --> 00:00:44,878
Why did the corpse disappear

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,578
when Denkyu took us to the annex with him and returned?

16
00:00:48,578 --> 00:00:51,378
Let's say that this pinwheel is the annex.

17
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:53,078
There is no railing at the annex

18
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:55,678
and there are four square 8-mat rooms.

19
00:00:57,078 --> 00:00:58,478
Railing?

20
00:00:58,478 --> 00:00:59,878
Square?

21
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:02,778
Oh my, you mean the third-rate detective kid of Osaka

22
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:05,178
can't figure it out yet?

23
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:07,578
No, I can't make out your deduction.

24
00:01:07,578 --> 00:01:13,078
Yes. It rotated 180 degrees, that annex!

25
00:01:15,978 --> 00:01:19,678
I don't think there's such a contraption in that annex.

26
00:01:19,678 --> 00:01:21,478
You just don't know of it.

27
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:24,378
I hear that the annex was built 50 years ago.

28
00:01:24,378 --> 00:01:25,878
Even so,

29
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,978
three days ago the police, and tonight you people,

30
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:30,678
who were called by me, after coming here

31
00:01:30,678 --> 00:01:34,678
investigated every nook and cranny, of all four rooms, didn't you?

32
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:35,678
Back then,

33
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:39,078
no blood nor corpse was found in any of the rooms, right?

34
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:40,878
Yeah, that's right.

35
00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:42,278
Besides,

36
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:45,878
if such an amusement park like building existed 50 years ago,

37
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:51,478
it would've become a famous site around here. Dumb-dumb!

38
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,078
Then...

39
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:57,778
There was no dead body so it was just your illusion!

40
00:01:57,778 --> 00:02:00,678
No, there was blood as well as the corpse.

41
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:05,478
Although they were hidden and out of sight.

42
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:08,978
Hidden... where on earth?

43
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:10,078
Ouch.

44
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:11,778
Conan!

45
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:16,278
Are you all right?

46
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:19,678
I slipped when I tried to pick up the badge I dropped.

47
00:02:19,678 --> 00:02:21,578
You've gotta be careful.

48
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:23,778
It seems to be quite muddy around here yet

49
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:25,678
from the rain this morning.

50
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,578
By the way, do you see my detective badge

51
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:30,178
somewhere around here?

52
00:02:30,178 --> 00:02:31,778
No, I don't see it.

53
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:34,678
Here's your glasses.

54
00:02:34,678 --> 00:02:36,278
Thank you!

55
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:37,878
There's your badge.

56
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:38,978
Oh, yeah.

57
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:42,778
But, how strange... it wasn't there a while ago.

58
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:44,178
That's true.

59
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:48,178
Maybe it's because of the leaf that's stuck on this glasses.

60
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:51,878
See, you can see the badge if it's like this

61
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:54,578
but, if you put the glasses with the leaf on it like this,

62
00:02:54,578 --> 00:02:57,678
you can't see it anymore.

63
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,678
Really. It's mixed up with the leaves on the ground.

64
00:03:00,678 --> 00:03:03,178
And it looks like there's no badge there.

65
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:08,378
Hey, maybe the same sort of trick was used?

66
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:09,578
Could be.

67
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:11,378
A trick?

68
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:14,078
Yeah, if this trick is used,

69
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:16,178
maybe even blood can be hidden.

70
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:18,578
Under the case of the statues of the Four Heavenly Kings

71
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:21,478
that were in the corner of the rooms of the annex.

72
00:03:21,478 --> 00:03:24,278
There was nothing below the cases.

73
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:26,278
The tatami below was in view under the case

74
00:03:26,278 --> 00:03:27,978
when I moved the statue too.

75
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:30,178
So if you cut the tatami

76
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:32,178
and paste the front side of the tatami onto the back of the glass case

77
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:35,778
and if it were placed on top of the tatami where the blood stain is...

78
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:38,178
The blood would be completely covered

79
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:39,678
and it would look as if you're looking at the tatami below

80
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,678
through the glass case, wouldn't it?

81
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:43,278
True.

82
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:46,378
But, the trick would give itself away

83
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:48,178
as soon as somebody lifts the case up, right?

84
00:03:48,178 --> 00:03:49,678
No way.

85
00:03:49,678 --> 00:03:52,578
If you lift the glass case with the statue inside it,

86
00:03:52,578 --> 00:03:56,578
it may fall and crack the glass,

87
00:03:56,578 --> 00:03:57,778
besides if you move the statue that's inside,

88
00:03:57,778 --> 00:04:00,678
it looks as if the tatami below is in view through the glass.

89
00:04:00,678 --> 00:04:02,178
Nobody would think of going out of the way

90
00:04:02,178 --> 00:04:04,178
to move the case after doing so!

91
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:07,478
I didn't move the case myself either.

92
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:12,378
But, who for what reason would've set up a trick like that?

93
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:17,278
Would the killer do something like that to hide the blood?

94
00:04:17,278 --> 00:04:19,578
The ones who set up this trick

95
00:04:19,578 --> 00:04:23,078
were probably the two monks who left this temple two months ago,

96
00:04:23,078 --> 00:04:24,578
in order to hide the liquor stains

97
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:26,278
and burnt remains from their cigarettes.

98
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:28,178
They probably went out to look for tatami

99
00:04:28,178 --> 00:04:30,678
that was very close in color to the one in the annex

100
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:34,178
and pasted it on to the bottom of the glass case of the statue,

101
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:37,878
to hide the stain and remains of burns.

102
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:41,678
Those two were in charge of cleaning the annex,

103
00:04:41,678 --> 00:04:43,878
and besides they told you that they succeeded

104
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:45,478
in pulling the trick, right?

105
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:46,978
Yes.

106
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:48,878
When we checked the annex at sundown,

107
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:51,178
we found nothing like that and yet,

108
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:53,078
when you came and told us you found the corpse

109
00:04:53,078 --> 00:04:55,078
and we went to check,

110
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:57,678
it suddenly appeared, that's the proof.

111
00:04:57,678 --> 00:04:58,978
Then, you mean

112
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,178
the two monks who left snuck back in here

113
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:05,578
and killed a woman from somewhere?

114
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:09,078
No. The two just set up the trick.

115
00:05:09,078 --> 00:05:10,678
The one who used it

116
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,078
is the one who saw through their trick

117
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,878
and bawled the two out.

118
00:05:15,678 --> 00:05:17,078
That is, no one else could've done it

119
00:05:17,078 --> 00:05:19,378
besides head monk Shakuren, right?

120
00:05:19,378 --> 00:05:21,078
You mean that Osho did it?

121
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:23,978
You mean he killed the woman?

122
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:25,378
No.

123
00:05:25,378 --> 00:05:28,678
If he killed somebody, he wouldn't have returned to the temple

124
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:30,178
and sleep like nothing happened

125
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:32,778
till Denkyu found the corpse three days ago.

126
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:35,378
That woman most probably committed suicide.

127
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:39,178
Osho, who heard from Denkyu that a woman was dead in the annex,

128
00:05:39,178 --> 00:05:41,678
probably came up with the idea on the spur of the moment.

129
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:43,678
He decided to say that it was Denkyu's illusion

130
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:46,878
and that there was no dead body to begin with!

131
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:48,378
Oh, no...

132
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:52,178
Since the blood of the woman that was smeared on the tatami

133
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:53,878
was in just about the same place

134
00:05:53,878 --> 00:05:55,678
as the stains of the liquor and cigarette,

135
00:05:55,678 --> 00:05:58,778
he probably used the trick of the case to hide them,

136
00:05:58,778 --> 00:06:00,078
and moved the tatami,

137
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:01,778
which after he place the case over it!

138
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,878
Then, where's that dead body?

139
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:07,978
Probably hidden under the porch of the annex or something,

140
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:09,778
until the police left.

141
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:12,178
So, the woman I saw tonight

142
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:13,878
-is the woman from three days ago... -No.

143
00:06:13,878 --> 00:06:16,878
I think that the corpse you saw tonight was probably

144
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:21,178
Osho dressed in a woman's outfit lying on the floor.

145
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:22,878
Osho?

146
00:06:22,878 --> 00:06:27,178
Yeah, using the wig that the other two monks used to wear.

147
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,578
He probably used ketchup or something

148
00:06:29,578 --> 00:06:32,578
and made it look as if he was stabbed in the stomach with a knife.

149
00:06:32,578 --> 00:06:36,578
He did so to make us as well as Denkyu

150
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:41,178
believe that the dead body of the woman was just an illusion.

151
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:42,978
But, isn't it strange?

152
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:46,078
The statues in the annex were all placed

153
00:06:46,078 --> 00:06:47,978
in the corner of the four rooms

154
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:51,078
on the upper right and lower left corner.

155
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,878
The two monks that set up the trick

156
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:57,678
hid the cigarette burn and liquor stain, that's two places.

157
00:06:57,678 --> 00:06:59,578
Even if the blood from the corpse three days

158
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:01,678
just happened to conveniently be in that position,

159
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:04,478
the corpse that Denkyu saw tonight, covered with blood

160
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:07,078
was lying in the middle of the room.

161
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:10,378
Which adds up to four blood-stained places.

162
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:11,978
With only two cases, I don't think

163
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:14,978
he could've hidden the blood stain that was smeared on today.

164
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:18,978
No, it's not two. There're four cases.

165
00:07:19,078 --> 00:07:21,578
Osho probably copied the two other monks

166
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:24,478
and rigged the remaining two cases in the same way.

167
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,978
Therefore, he had four places he could use to hide the stains.

168
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:29,278
So, today he put ketchup that looked to be blood

169
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:31,578
on a total of four mats-the two mats

170
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:32,878
that originally had blood stains on them

171
00:07:32,878 --> 00:07:34,178
and two other brand new ones that he acquired,

172
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:37,578
dressed in a woman's outfit and lay down on the middle of the room.

173
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:39,878
He waited for Denkyu to come lock the doors.

174
00:07:39,878 --> 00:07:41,578
He knew that Denkyu would panic and come get us,

175
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:44,078
so within that time Osho replaced the blood stained tatamis back

176
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:45,578
in the four corners.

177
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:48,178
He then appeared looking as if nothing happened from behind us,

178
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:50,478
who arrived at the annex!

179
00:07:53,878 --> 00:07:55,078
Like I've been trying to say,

180
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:57,078
if Osho was lying in the middle of the room

181
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:59,078
pretending to be the corpse,

182
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,178
the blood-like stain wouldn't be on the corner of the tatami,

183
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:03,878
but elsewhere, right?

184
00:08:03,878 --> 00:08:05,878
If so, wouldn't it be difficult to hide everything right

185
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:07,878
even if there were to be four cases?

186
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:09,978
Really? Can you really be sure?

187
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:12,678
Oh, I see!

188
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:14,278
All he had to do was switch the tatami

189
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:17,878
so that the blood stained part comes at the corner of the tatami!

190
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:21,278
But this way, the location of the blood,

191
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:23,978
although the upper right and lower left is the same,

192
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:27,178
the remaining two would be to the upper left and lower right.

193
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:28,378
So, it won't do.

194
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:31,778
Oh, maybe it's this way?

195
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,578
This way, the two on the upper right are okay,

196
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:38,178
but two are on the upper left.

197
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:43,478
So, he couldn't have just put the Buddhist statues

198
00:08:43,478 --> 00:08:47,478
in the four corners of the rooms to hide the blood stains, could he?

199
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:49,678
Are you sure those other the only ways you can line them up?

200
00:08:49,678 --> 00:08:52,878
Take a look at this.

201
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:54,078
Huh?

202
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:57,578
It's just like a pinwheel, don't you think?

203
00:08:59,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Oh, I see. If you line the tatami up this way...

204
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:06,578
The blood stains will all come to the upper right.

205
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:09,878
So, the position of the tatamis were changed after all

206
00:09:09,878 --> 00:09:12,778
when I found the corpse tonight!

207
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:15,278
But, why did Osho go out this far

208
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:17,178
to hide the corpse?

209
00:09:17,178 --> 00:09:20,478
Why did he carry things out as he did when he didn't even kill the woman?

210
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:24,178
Well, why don't we go and ask Osho himself?

211
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,230
"Black. Monk's confession"

212
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,530
Right, why did Osho do it?

213
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,130
Why did he have to hide the fact

214
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,530
despite having to act out the role of the corpse himself?

215
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,930
Because he didn't want the woman

216
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,530
to be identified during investigation?

217
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,230
He didn't want anyone to know who or where that woman came from?

218
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,930
Who didn't he want to let know?

219
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,730
Oh, seeing that you've come back,

220
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,430
I guess I didn't do a complete job at hiding what went on after all.

221
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,730
Of course not!

222
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,130
You could never in a billion years

223
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,230
deceive the eyes of Detective Kogoro Mouri!

224
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,730
I'm sorry to say this,

225
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,230
but before I explain what went on,

226
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,830
I'd like to have Denkyu leave until I'm done...

227
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,530
The monk is already back at the car.

228
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,530
We asked him to stay behind with the girls

229
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,030
so they'd feel more assured!

230
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,730
Since you're concerned about that monk,

231
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,230
that lady who committed suicide here three days ago is...

232
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,330
Yes, it was Denkyu's mother

233
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,730
who put Denkyu into a cardboard box and abandoned him,

234
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,630
leaving him in front of this temple.

235
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,930
Oh, is that so?

236
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,330
Yes, she suddenly came here out of the blue

237
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,430
saying that she wanted her son back.

238
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,130
She also added that she had been visiting this temple every year

239
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,330
and watched him mature.

240
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,730
Therefore, I thought of

241
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:09,630
showing her the pictures of all the young monks here at the temple.

242
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,730
However, just as I figured,

243
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,830
she couldn't tell which monk was her son,

244
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,630
and she finally breaks out in tears.

245
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,330
She didn't even realize that

246
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,230
the one who brought the album to her was her own son.

247
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,730
After I told Denkyu to leave the room,

248
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,830
I couldn't stop myself from scolding her quite firmly.

249
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,830
I told her to spend the night at annex that night and calm herself down.

250
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,930
To think of sadness that her son

251
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,630
had experienced for the past 18 years,

252
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,130
and to feel the same sadness all the way in her bones.

253
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,130
Then, at the break of dawn, that's how she was found.

254
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,330
I thought it too ruthless to let Denkyu know of this,

255
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,830
so I carried out what I did.

256
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,430
Shall we go then?

257
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,930
You'll take me to the police, won't you?

258
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,330
Oh, yes.

259
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:02,130
I know I'm in no position to say something like this.

260
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,030
If you still plan on continuing your job as a detective

261
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,630
who corners people with words,

262
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,830
there is something I'd like you to always keep in mind.

263
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,530
Words can be as sharp as blades,

264
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,030
if used wrongly,

265
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,130
they can turn into lethal weapons.

266
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,830
They must be used with great care taking into the consideration

267
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,330
how the listener is feeling.

268
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:25,330
No matter what kind of person your listener may be.

269
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,230
Why did Osho hide the corpse?

270
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,330
Yeah, hurry and stop keeping us in suspense and tell us!

271
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,530
Heiji! Hey, Heiji...

272
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,730
Shut up!

273
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,930
I'm saying I don't want to talk about it, stupid!

274
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,230
I have a feeling that in his case,

275
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,230
he really doesn't know how to say what he wants to say.

276
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,730
"Mouri Detective Agency"

277
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,130
Shoots! I slept for 10 hours!

278
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,230
Oh, well, a lot of things happened last night

279
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,730
and we did come home late,

280
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,530
and besides today is the Sunday before the start of a holiday.

281
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,130
It seems like Heiji and Kazuha went home already too.

282
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,930
I'm going to bed now, because we're leaving early tomorrow.

283
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,530
He said so too.

284
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,830
But, I wonder if he remembers

285
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,830
my asking him to check on Rena Mizunashi.

286
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,030
Well, I guess I could send him mail later to be sure.

287
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,930
Darn, all gone.

288
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,330
Here, you can use mine.

289
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,630
Oh, thanks.

290
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,730
How come you're still here?

291
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,430
I thought you said you were leaving early in the morning?

292
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,330
Yeah, I was planning to,

293
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,730
but thanks to Pop's snore.

294
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,030
I mean it was so loud I couldn't sleep.

295
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,930
Thanks to him my schedule's all ruined.

296
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,430
Then, shouldn't buy your ticket all over again as soon as possible?

297
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,530
No, it's okay, I'm not leaving yet.

298
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,030
Why not?

299
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,730
What? An uninhabited island?

300
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,730
You mean, you're going there from now?

301
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,830
Yeah, I just happened to be able to view flowers in the meantime.

302
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,330
Do you have a case to check out for someone?

303
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,430
No.

304
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,330
It's this dopey plan of some TV station.

305
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,830
Hey, shut up!

306
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,230
But, is that all right?

307
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,030
Weren't you supposed to leave early in the morning?

308
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,330
No, we'll make it in way enough time

309
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,330
even if we were to head off there from now.

310
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,330
If so, then why?

311
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,430
I just wanted to go there before everyone else

312
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,830
and check out the faces and personalities of the guys

313
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,930
that were invited over there.

314
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,130
That is, what the other high school detectives like me look like.

315
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,030
High school detectives?

316
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,130
Right,

317
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,930
Nichiuri TV's gathering guys from throughout the country

318
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,330
and is going to be deciding who the number one high school detective is.

319
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,530
They have a sign that says, "Detective Championship Game."

320
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:21,898
"Blue. Beyond the see" -Detective Championship Game?

321
00:15:21,898 --> 00:15:24,898
So, I told him to forget it!

322
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:28,398
Because he'll just end up being called a fool if he goes there.

323
00:15:28,398 --> 00:15:31,598
I thought so too, but I couldn't help it!

324
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,198
I got a letter asking for me to participate.

325
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:38,198
For Heiji Hattori, to represent the Detective of the West.

326
00:15:38,398 --> 00:15:40,098
Huh, the west?

327
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:42,798
Yeah, if I represent the west,

328
00:15:42,798 --> 00:15:45,098
the east would of course be...

329
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:47,498
Shinichi?

330
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:50,298
Oh, Ran's crimson red!

331
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:54,698
Well, it's kind of warm today, isn't it? That's why.

332
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:57,198
Don't tell me that detective kid is going to be there.

333
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:58,798
I'm sure he'll be there.

334
00:15:58,798 --> 00:16:00,498
No, he won't.

335
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:03,798
I mean he should know that I'm not, already.

336
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:07,398
How about it? Don't you and Ran also want to come along?

337
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:10,398
They say that there are lodgings for people who come along

338
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:15,298
and that snobbish high school detective Shinichi Kudo

339
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:18,898
just might be there too! Right?

340
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:27,898
You're late, Hattori.

341
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:29,498
Be on time, will you?

342
00:16:29,498 --> 00:16:31,998
We're moving along by the minute, you know!

343
00:16:31,998 --> 00:16:33,398
Oh, I'm sorry,

344
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:35,598
I kind of took the wrong road you see.

345
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:37,898
"Hiroo Tsuchio (41)" -Well, let's hurry on to the island!

346
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:40,798
Everyone's already on board the ship too!

347
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:43,798
Is Shinichi already there too?

348
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:47,798
Shinichi Kudo, the high school detective of the east!

349
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,898
They couldn't get a hold of him,

350
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:52,698
so they don't know if he's going to be there.

351
00:16:52,698 --> 00:16:54,598
No joke?

352
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,298
Well, I guess so.

353
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:58,698
I mean, it's only natural...

354
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:00,498
But, do they really have lodgings

355
00:17:00,498 --> 00:17:03,698
for people who come along to the uninhabited island?

356
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:04,698
Oh, well...

357
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:06,998
there's only one old lodge on that island so...

358
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:11,298
the guardians will be spending the night at that hotel,

359
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:12,998
and after the shooting is over,

360
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:16,098
we want all of you to come pick them up.

361
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:19,398
Can I take this kid along with me?

362
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:21,598
He's sort of like my assistant, you see.

363
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:25,598
Okay, if he's going to be sleeping in your room together.

364
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:27,798
Gee, what a big ship it is.

365
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:28,898
How many people is it capable of taking?

366
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:30,498
Don't tell me that there is one detective

367
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:32,598
from all 47 prefectural and city governments?

368
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:36,098
No, we just called four detectives from the east, west, south and north.

369
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,098
We used this ship only because it stands out

370
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,498
and thought it would make meeting everyone here easier.

371
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:42,298
-What? -The ship we're boarding is over there.

372
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,598
It's this ship.

373
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,898
Come, hurry on board because we're pressed for time.

374
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:52,498
Hey, Hattori.

375
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:53,598
What?

376
00:17:53,598 --> 00:17:57,098
Are you acquainted with that director of Nichiuri TV?

377
00:17:57,098 --> 00:18:00,498
No. I met him for the first time today.

378
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:02,398
He told me that he'd be wearing the stadium jumper

379
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:05,598
with the mark of Nichiuri TV so to keep on the look out for him.

380
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:07,098
Heiji!

381
00:18:07,098 --> 00:18:08,598
You're representing the Kansai district

382
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:11,498
so you're going to get it if you lose!

383
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:14,098
Okay! I'll be sure to leave a message behind

384
00:18:14,098 --> 00:18:16,398
that says, "Heiji Hattori was here!"

385
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,298
So, after arriving on the island,

386
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:24,398
please stay in your rooms and don't leave until dinner time.

387
00:18:24,398 --> 00:18:28,298
So, if anything's going to happen, it will be after dinner.

388
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:29,798
But be on your guard,

389
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:31,398
because the match is already started

390
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:34,298
as soon as you step foot on the island.

391
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:35,598
Okay.

392
00:18:35,598 --> 00:18:37,898
Roger.

393
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:40,398
Strange, I figured everyone would be more excited

394
00:18:40,398 --> 00:18:44,198
because this is a Detective Championship Game.

395
00:18:44,198 --> 00:18:47,498
And why did you bring me along?

396
00:18:47,498 --> 00:18:48,798
Don't tell me that you want me to team with you

397
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:50,598
so that you can win or something?

398
00:18:50,598 --> 00:18:55,098
No, Shinichi Kudo of the east can't come anyway.

399
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:58,198
That's why I figured you should come and join us too.

400
00:18:58,198 --> 00:19:01,698
It'll be too boring if I win the game just like that.

401
00:19:01,698 --> 00:19:04,598
You're about the only one here that's an equal match for me.

402
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:08,598
But, you even brought Ran and the others over too.

403
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:13,098
I wouldn't come to such a corny game alone myself either.

404
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:22,198
Are you seasick?

405
00:19:22,198 --> 00:19:25,098
Oh, no. It's a hang-over.

406
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:26,998
It took a while to shoot yesterday so...

407
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:30,198
I went out drinking with the staff after we finished, and got wasted.

408
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:35,098
So, you went "overboard".

409
00:19:35,098 --> 00:19:36,498
"Overboard?"

410
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:40,898
Well, the shop was really high priced.

411
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:44,798
Hey, mister, this is in the way, laugh, will you? It's too narrow.

412
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:47,398
Laugh? A narrow heart.

413
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:51,198
Oh, you were playing on words using "overboard" and "high."

414
00:19:53,398 --> 00:19:57,998
Those two seem pretty sharp.

415
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:00,098
Detective Championship Game?

416
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,898
Nichuri TV?

417
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:05,798
We have no such reservation.

418
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:08,198
Hey, check it out carefully, will you?

419
00:20:08,198 --> 00:20:10,998
Dinner and breakfast are supposed to be included too.

420
00:20:10,998 --> 00:20:13,698
-Yes, but... -What?

421
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:15,498
What's going on?

422
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:24,898
Welcome.

423
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:27,298
I'm the one who will be taking care of you,

424
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:28,898
my name is Renzo Koya.

425
00:20:28,898 --> 00:20:32,798
Nice to meet you all. I'll show you to your lodge.

426
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,198
Hey, director.

427
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:38,598
If the high school detective of the east isn't coming,

428
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:41,998
I'd like to talk something over with you.

429
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:43,998
Huh?

430
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:45,898
The representative from the east

431
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:49,398
arrived here early this morning and is already at the lodge.

432
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:52,198
What did you say? Is that true?

433
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:55,198
If I remember correctly, his name was...

434
00:21:01,198 --> 00:21:02,898
I see.

435
00:21:02,898 --> 00:21:03,898
"Please cancel tomorrow's" -This is indeed

436
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:05,098
"Please cancel tomorrow's" -an isolated island cut off

437
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,698
"dinner reservation." -from the outside world.

438
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:13,098
There couldn't be a situation better than this for a mystery.

439
00:21:14,498 --> 00:21:16,498
Saguru Hakuba?

440
00:21:18,598 --> 00:21:20,898
Who is he?
