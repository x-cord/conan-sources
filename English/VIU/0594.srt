Oh, yeah?

38
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,641
So, we were on a visit to Hiroshima

as guests in a travel program

What's the matter, Sonoko?

57

You said that you were going to join us here and yet...

I mean, are you still at home?

Well, you see,

I can't decide on what clothes to wear.

61
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:35,178
I wonder if I should wear

62
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:37,178
a maple patterned one-piece because it suits autumn?

63
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:40,678
Or, should I wear something more grown up like this one?

64
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:43,478
I think both of them look good on you.

We're sorry to have caused you worry.

70

We got him to take some medicine for now,

I guess we're leaving soon, so I'd better hang up.

No, no, I don't come along all the time.

Since Miyajima itself is awed by many

because of its many gods on land,

I left this drink together with our belongings over there.

Maybe it's a prank?

128

Isn't it going a little too far?

129

If I remember correctly,

130

I think Mr. Kamisuwa was near the things.

Hey, hey, cut it out.

Yeah. If I remember correctly, from about 2 weeks ago,

there's a guy that's been asking around about us.

I thought that the guy I saw a while ago looked like him.

148
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:17,878
That man came all the way from Hiroshima after the crew

149
00:09:17,878 --> 00:09:20,678
and put salt into the canned coffee?

150

Although this is just a rumor,

00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,678
What're the seven wonders of Misen?

169
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:18,178
It's a legend that's been handed down from the days of old about Misen

170
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:20,578
that stands tall in the center of Miyajima.

171
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,578
"Misen"

172
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:24,678
It includes the Kiezu no Hi (inextinguishable fire)

173
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:26,878
that is said to have never stopped burning

174
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:29,178
since Kobo-Daishi practiced asceticism.

175
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:30,678
The Shakujo no Ume (Tin Staff Plum Tree),

176
00:10:30,678 --> 00:10:31,978
the tree on which the tin staff

177
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:34,778
that Kobo-Daishi is said to have leaned against, that took root.

178
00:10:34,778 --> 00:10:36,378
The Kan Man Iwa (Ebb and Flow Rock)

179
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:38,578
in which the salt water that accumulates in a hole,

180
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:40,578
increases and decreases along with ebb and flow of the tide.

181
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:41,978
The Mandara Iwa (Mandala Rock)

182
00:10:41,978 --> 00:10:45,878
in which the writing of Kobo-Daishi is carved on.

183
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,278
The Hyoshigi no Oto (Sound of the Wooden Clappers),

184
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:48,378
the sound of wooded clappers sounded

185
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:51,278
by the goblin that resides in Misen.

186
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:52,878
The Shidare Zakura (Dewy Cherry Blossoms)

187
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:55,378
that looks wet even on clear days with no rain.

188
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:58,078
The Ryuto no Sugi (Dragon Fire Cedar),

189
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,778
a mysterious light that appears in the sea of Miyajima

190
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:04,678
that can be seen from the mountain top of Misen.

191
00:11:04,678 --> 00:11:08,578
These maple buns are of assorted flavours

192
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:10,578
that symbolize the 7 wonders of what I just mentioned.

193
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:12,078
I see.

194
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:16,078
This tastes like plum.

195
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:18,478
That's the Tin Staff Plum.

196
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:21,978
This is sakura sweet bean paste.

197
00:11:21,978 --> 00:11:23,478
Dewy Cherry Blossom!

198
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:25,978
Inextinguishable Fire is a bit spicy hot!

199
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:27,278
Interesting!

200
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,178
Cut! Okay!

201
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:33,378
You're both pretty good!

202
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:35,278
Wow, Conan!

203
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,878
You may just be able to debut as a child star!

204
00:11:37,878 --> 00:11:40,778
I've been playing the role of a child for quite a while already.

205
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:48,378
What's this?

206
00:11:48,378 --> 00:11:50,478
My, how nostalgic!

207
00:11:50,478 --> 00:11:53,478
-Have you been here before? -Yes.

208
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:55,578
I think it was in autumn two years ago.

209
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:58,378
I came here on an interview for a different TV program.

210
00:11:58,378 --> 00:12:00,678
Long time no see.

211
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,778
I heard that you were coming again, so I couldn't wait

212
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:07,178
and had it on display from 2 weeks ago.

213
00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:11,678
This guy's... The one I saw a while ago!

214
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:13,078
Huh?

215
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:14,778
See, this guy!

216
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:17,078
"Shinroku Ayase (27)" -Isn't he the guy we saw a while ago?

217
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:19,878
Huh? Do you know my older brother?

218
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:23,978
Your older brother, Yayoi?

219
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,778
Your older brother's whereabouts

220
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:29,878
have been unknown since 2 weeks ago?

221
00:12:29,878 --> 00:12:33,178
Yes. In fact, in autumn two years ago,

222
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:36,778
my parents entered the no trespassing area of Misen,

223
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:40,378
slipped and fell to their death.

224
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:46,378
But my older brother and I had doubts about their death.

225
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:48,378
That our parents who were used to Misen

226
00:12:48,378 --> 00:12:51,378
wouldn't have fallen to their death.

227
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:54,578
My older brother investigated the area thoroughly

228
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:57,978
and found "it".

229
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,578
What's the "it"?

230
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,278
A glittering pretty accessory-like thing,

231
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:05,878
shaped like a flower.

232
00:13:05,878 --> 00:13:07,378
About a half a month ago,

233
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:09,678
he said that he found out the identity of it,

234
00:13:09,678 --> 00:13:11,378
and left home.

235
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:13,978
I haven't seen him since and can't get a hold of him either.

236
00:13:13,978 --> 00:13:16,178
Mr. Mouri, I beg of you!

237
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:18,478
Could you please find my older brother?

238
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:19,678
Oh, yes.

239
00:13:19,678 --> 00:13:23,678
I'm sorry, but we're pressed for time filming.

240
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,778
I see.

241
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:27,778
Why would your older brother

242
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:31,278
want to hang around the crew of Nichiuri TV?

243
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,678
Wait a sec. In autumn two years ago...

244
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:35,678
If I remember correctly,

245
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:39,478
Mr. Koshiji and the others were here in Miyajima.

246
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:41,378
Maybe this is connected with the accident

247
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:42,878
that happened here 2 years ago.

248
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:47,978
"Senjokaku"

249
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:53,578
Strange.

250
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:54,778
What's wrong?

251
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:57,578
Well, it's a call from Miyake,

252
00:13:57,578 --> 00:14:01,978
but I don't remember setting such a strange ringtone.

253
00:14:01,978 --> 00:14:04,678
Is this the sound of wooden clappers?

254
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,078
Why don't you try answering?

255
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:08,978
Okay.

256
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:12,978
Hello, Miyake?

257
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:16,878
What's up? Answer me.

258
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:18,578
Hello?

259
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:20,878
Where on earth is Ms. Miyake?

260
00:14:27,678 --> 00:14:31,078
Time wise I don't think she is somewhere too far.

261
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:34,978
Ms. Miyake! Are you all right?

262
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:40,278
I'm glad, she's not all that badly hurt.

263
00:14:43,878 --> 00:14:45,278
This is...

264
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,350
Are you all right?

265
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,550
Yes, it's no big deal.

266
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,650
Why were you in a place like that?

267
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,250
That person...

268
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,450
I saw somebody that resembled Yayoi's older brother, so I...

269
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,750
What? My older brother?

270
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,150
I went after him,

271
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,250
and suddenly the stone from a stone fence came falling...

272
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,250
Putting salt in canned coffee is not that serious,

273
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,650
but this is going a bit too far.

274
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,750
It's the same, isn't it?

275
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,950
-With the seven wonders. -Huh?

276
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,150
Audio man Mr. Yatsukawa's coffee

277
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,550
was spoiled with salt poured into it.

278
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,850
The sound of wooden clappers that was set as the ringtone

279
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,250
before he noticed anything had been changed.

280
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,650
The thing that hurt Ms. Miyake, in charge of make-up

281
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,950
was a blotched stone.

282
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,950
They are each objects of the 7 Wonders of Misen.

283
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,550
The Ebb and Flow Rock,

284
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,450
the sound of the wooden clappers,

285
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,050
and the Mandala Rock. Don't they all match?

286
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,250
True!

287
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,750
It's amazing that you noticed, sonny!

288
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,850
Stay out of it, kid.

289
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,750
That's only three out of seven!

290
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,850
It's just a coincidence, understand? A coincidence!

291
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,950
I wonder about that. There could be more.

292
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,350
They are!

293
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,450
Assistant Producer, Mr. Kitayama's necktie,

294
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,950
the pattern on it is the Dewy Cherry Blossoms, right?

295
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,450
Now that you mentioned it.

296
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,750
Yeah, it was of bad taste that was out of season.

297
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,950
One more of the 7 Wonders,

298
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,650
Dewy Cherry Blossoms!

299
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,350
Then, maybe...

300
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,850
And his stomachache...

301
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,150
It could've been caused by somebody too?

302
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,950
By somebody...

303
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,550
Do you mean Yayoi's older brother?

304
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,450
Oh, no.

305
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,250
If so, but why us?

306
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,850
You have no idea as to why?

307
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,150
Maybe you should also go ask Mr. Kitamura?

308
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,850
I know.

309
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,750
Mr. Kamisuwa.

310
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,650
He's not answering.

311
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,650
I wonder if he's sleeping?

312
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,650
Just to be safe, let's have the hotel staff go check on him.

313
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,250
I see. So he's asleep after all.

314
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,550
Then, please leave him a message to call us when he gets up.

315
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,350
Thank you so very much.

316
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,850
There are three 7 wonders left.

317
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,750
Is something else going to happen yet?

318
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,250
And, besides that guy...

319
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,250
Is Yayoi's older brother really involved?

320
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,650
Wait a sec.

321
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,350
Her older brother disappeared two weeks ago and...

322
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,250
That photo was also placed there two weeks ago.

323
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,250
Maybe...

324
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,350
Her older brother saw the picture and...

325
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,550
What shall we do, Mr. Kamisuwa?

326
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,050
What's scheduled today?

327
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,550
After this, we go over to Daishoin and that's it!

328
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,950
Then, filming is priority.

329
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,750
We'll talk about this again tonight or something.

330
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,350
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri,

331
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,050
but I hope that's okay with you.

332
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,950
Okay.

333
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,450
Okay, let's move it then!

334
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,650
Yes, sir!

335
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,550
"Daishoin"

336
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,150
Cut!

337
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,450
Okay, all done!

338
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,550
Thanks for all the work, everyone!

339
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,950
We've only got one more scene to go today!

340
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,650
There's something about those two.

341
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,950
I'd better keep my eyes on them.

342
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,450
"Kannon Hall"

343
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,950
Next, is the mental training in the dark

344
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,450
that helps get rid of the sins of this world,

345
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,350
climbing the "Ordination Platform"!

346
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,250
Ran, Conan, we're counting on you!

347
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,250
Huh, you mean we're going in here all by ourselves?

348
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,550
I'm not too comfortable with things like this.

349
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,750
Rather, this is bad,

350
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,450
because I'm not going to be able to watch those two.

351
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,050
Hey, you're a boy, don't be a panty!

352
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,550
Go on, go on!

353
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,450
Give it all you got, Ran!

354
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,850
Come on, inside, inside!

355
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,950
Hey, Conan.

356
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,550
Don't go without me.

357
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,450
Let's go together, Conan.

358
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,450
We're finally outside.

359
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,450
That's all for today.

360
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,650
We'll see you again tomorrow!

361
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,450
Thank you so very much.

362
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,750
Huh? Where are Mr. Kamisuwa and Mr. Koshiji?

363
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,550
Somebody, come here!

364
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,250
What was that?

365
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,050
Mr. Kamisuwa?

366
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,450
Mr. Koshiji!

367
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,650
This is...

368
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,350
Mr. Koshiji!

369
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,850
He's still breathing.

370
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,750
Mr. Yatsukawa, call an ambulance!

371
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,850
Fire... He was there...

372
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,350
What?

373
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,350
Fire? He was there?

374
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,150
Who was there?

375
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,050
-The culprit? -What?

376
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,050
Mr. Koshiji, once more!

377
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,050
No good, he passed out.

378
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,350
This is...

379
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,150
The strap of his cell phone is...

380
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,750
the tin staff!

381
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,850
A small replica of the Tin Staff Plum, one of the 7 wonders?

382
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,650
Did the culprit drop it?

383
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,350
It's him.

384
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,450
Huh?

385
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,850
I saw the guy we saw in the afternoon run off beyond.

386
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,050
Why didn't you say so sooner?

387
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,350
Don't tell me he's planning to flee on the ferry.

388
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,750
Will I make it?

389
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,850
-Excuse me! -I'm sorry!

390
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,150
Where's the ferry?

391
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,850
Too late?

392
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,850
Hey, that!

393
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,850
It's that guy!

394
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,050
Darn it! We almost got him!

395
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,950
Big trouble! Misenya's on fire!

396
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,750
What?

397
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,250
Fire, the shop, eh?

398
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,950
Somebody! Somebody!

399
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,550
-Did you bring water? -Hurry up!

400
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,950
-Yayoi! -Are you all right?

401
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,650
Yes.

402
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,750
Kitamura?

403
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,850
Mr. Kamisuwa, I'm sorry for the inconvenience I caused.

404
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,850
This is no time for something like that right now.

405
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,450
Koshiji's been attacked and Misenya's on fire.

406
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,450
Huh? Mr. Koshiji's been attacked?

407
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,250
A fire? What's going on?

408
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,550
Mr. Kitamura who's resting at a hotel in Hiroshima...

409
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,450
Mr. Kamisuwa! This is bad!

410
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,750
Just before the fire broke out,

411
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,950
the people of the neighborhood seem to have seen

412
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,050
someone who resembled her older brother.

413
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,850
What?

414
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,350
"Next Episode" -I'm sure that guy's the culprit!

415
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,650
You mean her older brother...

416
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,350
He attacked Mr. Koshiji and set fire to his own house?

417
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,450
"Renown Detective of Gourmet Tour Solves the Case!"

418
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,150
I'm sure we'll get high viewer rating!

419
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,850
Yayoi?

420
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,450
We may be attacked again too, you know.

421
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,850
I'm not letting the culprit do as he wants to anymore!

422
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,250
Now, it's our turn!!

423
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,350
Next Conan,

424
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:30,550
"Hiroshima, Miyajima 7 Wonders Tour (Hiroshima Edition)"

425
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,350
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,650
"High rise condominium"

427
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,050
Okay, dig in to oysters and conger eels!

428
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,150
Dad, what about the case?

429
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,350
Just get me beer first of all!

430
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,550
Hey, hey.
