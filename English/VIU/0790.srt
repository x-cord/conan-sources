About the thing that you asked me to do the other day.

3
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:08,110
As a result of scrupulous investigation,

4
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:09,511
Mr. Kanzaki...

5

There is no one who has a grudge against you!

"Yukio Kanzaki (23)" -But, I got a call saying,

7
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:21,210
"I'm going to kill you for sure."

8
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:25,210
Yeah, you mentioned you got such a call about twice.

9
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:28,010
I think it's a prank that your friends are playing on you.

10
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:30,210
Prank?

11
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:33,510
No matter who I ask, you have a great reputation.

12
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:35,610
You're just being teased.

13
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:38,610
Well, I guess he's right.

"Katsumi Udagawa (41)" -I hope you're really right

15
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:44,610
about somebody not wanting to come after Mr. Kanzaki's life.

16
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,810
You're Mr. Udagawa, was it?

17
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:49,710
I understand you worrying about him being his superior, but...

18
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:52,010
If someone were really planning to hurt him,

19
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:54,510
no warning would be given.

20
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:56,810
Because that will only serve to put him on his guard.

21
00:00:56,811 --> 00:01:00,011
The perpetrator has nothing to gain from it.

33
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:49,863
I'm sorry to have to ask you the same thing repeatedly.

34
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:54,162
Mr. Mouri.

35
00:03:54,163 --> 00:03:57,462
Inspector Megure, who's the victim that was stabbed?

36
00:03:57,463 --> 00:04:01,662
It was employee, Mr. Gosuke Shimomura, age 25.

37
00:04:01,663 --> 00:04:04,962
Just like Mr. Kanzaki, he works under me.

38
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:08,762
He was taken to the hospital by ambulance just now.

39
00:04:08,763 --> 00:04:13,862
The perpetrator mistook Mr. Shimomura for Mr. Kanzaki,

40
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:15,162
is that true?

41
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:16,862
Yeah.

42
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:19,262
Just because he was inside Bekapon outfit.

43
00:04:19,263 --> 00:04:20,662
Bekapon?

44
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:24,462
It's Beikado's mascot character, right?

45
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:27,862
"Hiroshi Fujii (50)" -I'm Fujii, the store manager.

Every Sunday at Beikado Supermarket,

47
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:36,263
Bekapon distributes fliers and balloons to the customers.

48
00:04:38,263 --> 00:04:39,962
At this Josai store,

49
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:44,662
we always have Mr. Kanzaki wear the Bekapon outfit.

50
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:45,663
You?

51
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:49,262
Yes. I was supposed to wear it today too,

52
00:04:49,263 --> 00:04:51,762
but I had an upset stomach from this morning.

53
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:54,362
And so, he talked it over with Mr. Udagawa

54
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:55,763
in charge of the sales floor and...

55

"Gosuke Shimomura (25)" -You're telling me to wear Bekapon in his place?

56
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:06,462
You're the next youngest to Mr. Kanzaki.

00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:08,662
Please, Mr. Shimomura.

The children are looking forward to meeting Bekapon.

59
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:15,062
Not good. Here it comes again.

The medicine I just gave you is really effective.

61

It's an emergency. Please.

64
00:05:27,063 --> 00:05:29,962
Be at the store by 11:00 as always.

65
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:33,162
I guess I've got no choice since it's a business order.

66
00:05:33,163 --> 00:05:34,863
Right, Bekapon?

67
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:37,362
At 10:50...

68
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:39,063
I guess I better get going.

69
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:47,862
"Teruko Akaiwa (62)" -Gosh, I know it's my job,

70
00:05:47,863 --> 00:05:49,863
but I really don't want to do this.

71
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:57,362
Die!

72
00:05:57,363 --> 00:05:58,863
Kanzaki!

73
00:06:05,763 --> 00:06:08,962
I see, the perpetrator said "Die! Kanzaki!"?

74
00:06:08,963 --> 00:06:11,062
Yes, definitely.

75
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:14,562
The perpetrator knew that Mr. Kanzaki was the one

76
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:16,662
inside Bekapon all the time, then?

77
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:18,662
But, the perpetrator didn't know

78
00:06:18,663 --> 00:06:21,462
that somebody was taking Mr. Kanzaki's place just for today,

79
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:23,262
and attacked Mr. Shimomura

80
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:26,362
thinking that it was Mr. Kanzaki and fled.

81
00:06:26,363 --> 00:06:28,862
He attacked the wrong target.

82
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,662
A mistake.

83
00:06:31,663 --> 00:06:36,962
The murder threat was not a joke after all, Mr. Mouri.

84
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:42,062
And, Mr. Shimomura was victimized in my place.

85
00:06:42,063 --> 00:06:45,362
So, my investigation wasn't thorough enough.

86
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,162
But, I wonder why the perpetrator attacked him

87
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:51,363
when he was wearing the mascot outfit?

88
00:06:52,463 --> 00:06:54,162
Probably because that way, he could avoid

89
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,862
getting the victim's blood from splattering on him.

90
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:58,962
Maybe so but...

91
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:02,262
To think that he stabbed the wrong person just because of that,

92
00:07:02,263 --> 00:07:04,663
he really did a sloppy job.

93
00:07:06,163 --> 00:07:12,062
But, that sloppy jobber is going to find out soon that he goofed.

94
00:07:12,063 --> 00:07:14,562
Which means that he's going to come after me for real next time.

95
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:15,662
Yeah.

96
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:16,962
But, don't worry!

97
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:20,262
I'll find that guy before he gets to you.

98
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:22,162
I swear on my job that I will!

99
00:07:22,163 --> 00:07:23,863
-Mr. Mouri? -Mouri!

100
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:29,163
Hey... How are you going to find him, pops?

101
00:07:30,863 --> 00:07:32,762
Inspector Megure.

102
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:34,162
On the security camera,

103
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:36,462
there was no man wearing the kind of clothes

104
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:38,163
the eye-witness described.

105
00:07:39,163 --> 00:07:42,362
But I saw it with my very eyes!

106
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:45,462
He was wearing a yellow top and red slacks!

107
00:07:45,463 --> 00:07:48,662
Then, he probably took off the balaclava that he was wearing

108
00:07:48,663 --> 00:07:51,662
and took off his flashy clothes and changed.

109
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:55,762
The perpetrator probably took them with him when he fled,

110
00:07:55,763 --> 00:07:58,662
or if it's somebody from inside who did it,

111
00:07:58,663 --> 00:08:03,462
it could still be hidden somewhere in this store.

112
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:06,362
You're suspecting our employees?

113
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:09,662
Well, if it's somebody from the inside,

114
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:12,462
he would know that Mr. Kanzaki was always wearing Bekapon's outfit.

115
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:15,462
Well, that's true, but...

116
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:19,262
Boss! Let's have them check the place out thoroughly.

117
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:22,062
To see if the balaclava's hidden somewhere.

118
00:08:22,063 --> 00:08:24,962
It would help to clear suspicion from the everybody too.

119
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,462
Yeah.

120
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:29,762
Okay! I'll have everyone cooperate.

121
00:08:29,763 --> 00:08:32,962
Please check everything including everyone's belongings.

122
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:34,562
Thank you very much!

123
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:35,962
Officer Takagi! Officer Chiba!

124
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:37,062
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

125
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:39,762
I'll start by talking to you, Mr. Kanzaki.

126
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:41,462
Yes, sir.

127
00:08:41,463 --> 00:08:45,263
This case sure is full of incomprehensible things.

128
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:48,962
I have no idea who the perpetrator could be.

129
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:52,763
That's why I went to ask Mr. Mouri to find out who it is...

130
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:57,762
But, I'm sure you have at least a little idea of something, don't you?

131
00:08:57,763 --> 00:08:59,962
First, the warning of the threat of murder.

132
00:08:59,963 --> 00:09:03,162
Why would the perpetrator go out of his way to warn of the murder?

133
00:09:03,163 --> 00:09:06,362
A yellow top and red slacks.

134
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:09,162
The perpetrator must be young.

135
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:11,262
No, it's also possible that he chose flashy colors

136
00:09:11,263 --> 00:09:15,162
to make everyone think so.

137
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:18,062
Since the perpetrator isn't shown on the security camera...

138
00:09:18,063 --> 00:09:22,262
He must've attacked the victim wearing the flashy clothes,

139
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:25,762
then changed again to the original clothes that he was wearing.

140
00:09:25,763 --> 00:09:28,563
Why would he do something so troublesome?

141
00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:32,962
It's much easier to attack his target on a dark street at night and yet...

142
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:35,562
It seems to be nowhere here.

143
00:09:35,563 --> 00:09:37,762
Let's check the personal belongings.

144
00:09:37,763 --> 00:09:39,362
Yes.

145
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:43,862
I'm sorry to make you do this.

146
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:47,863
We're missing two young ones so it can't be helped.

147
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,262
Here.

148
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,062
It's hot.

149
00:09:58,063 --> 00:10:01,562
Mr. Udagawa, you're sweating a lot too.

150
00:10:01,563 --> 00:10:03,362
You should take off your top.

151
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:05,462
Or at least roll up your sleeves.

152
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:06,862
Oh, well...

153
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:09,062
I have a slight cold, you see.

154
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:12,362
More importantly, don't you think the police is rude

155
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:14,762
to suspect the employees.

156
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:16,463
True...

157
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:23,662
I'm sorry, it's Bekapon's day off today.

158
00:10:23,663 --> 00:10:25,162
What?

159
00:10:25,163 --> 00:10:27,662
And the thing that bothers me most is...

160
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:30,562
When the perpetrator committed the crime he warned, he would carry out.

161
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,363
It just so happened that a substitute was inside Bekapon.

162
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:39,462
Wait a second...

163
00:10:39,463 --> 00:10:41,863
What if it wasn't just a coincidence?

164
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:45,863
If so, everything falls into place...

165
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:49,562
"Noriko Izumi (24)" -You want to know if Mr. Kanzaki and Mr. Shimomura

166
00:10:49,563 --> 00:10:51,662
were on good terms with each other?

167
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:55,162
Yes, I was told to ask you.

168
00:10:55,163 --> 00:10:58,462
Mr. Kanzaki is a nice and optimistic person,

169
00:10:58,463 --> 00:11:01,362
But Mr. Shimomura is the exact opposite.

170
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:04,462
Which means they didn't get along, right?

171
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,863
I guess not...

172
00:11:07,163 --> 00:11:09,062
What's wrong?

173
00:11:09,063 --> 00:11:10,662
Oh, boss.

174
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:12,662
Something about he's running an errand for Mr. Mouri.

175
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:14,262
What did Mr. Mouri want?

176
00:11:14,263 --> 00:11:16,562
I don't know for sure myself.

177
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:18,663
Thank you, miss. See you.

178
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:28,762
You're still here?

179
00:11:28,763 --> 00:11:33,762
Mr. Kanzaki, where were you when Mr. Shimomura was attacked?

180
00:11:33,763 --> 00:11:35,162
Why do want to know?

181
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:38,062
Pops asked me to ask you.

182
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:39,362
Mr. Mouri did?

183
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:43,662
So, Mr. Mouri also suspects the employees.

184
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:48,663
But, back then Mr. Kanzaki was resting in the break room.

185
00:11:49,763 --> 00:11:53,063
At around a little past 11:00 am, Ms. Izumi...

186
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:56,962
Oh, there you are, boss!

187
00:11:56,963 --> 00:12:00,862
I came to look in on Mr. Kanzaki because I was worried.

188
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:02,662
He's fast asleep.

189
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:04,362
More importantly, boss!

190
00:12:04,363 --> 00:12:06,562
Mr. Shimomura was stabbed!

191
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:07,563
What?

192
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:11,262
I'm the witness to his alibi.

193
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,762
Go and make sure you tell Mr. Mouri that.

194
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:15,562
Okay...

195
00:12:15,563 --> 00:12:17,662
How's your stomach?

196
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:19,362
Thanks to the medicine you gave,

197
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,762
I've completely recovered...

198
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:23,162
Then, will you go back to the sales floor?

199
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:26,962
All right, as soon as I finish my lunch.

200
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:29,762
Mr. Mouri suspects me.

201
00:12:29,763 --> 00:12:31,262
Well, not really.

202
00:12:31,263 --> 00:12:34,362
There was no warning of a murder to begin with.

203
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:38,362
That I faked being ill, had Mr. Shimomura wear Bekapon's outfit,

204
00:12:38,363 --> 00:12:39,662
then after making it look like a mistake,

205
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:42,762
I tried to kill him.

206
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:46,063
He probably thought it that way.

207
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:49,963
That's what I thought.

208
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,619
You really did receive a warning of murder, right?

209
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,519
Yes. I received the first one on my cell phone.

210
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,919
But the one that really surprised me was the second one.

211
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,319
Is there a Mr. Kanzaki here?

212
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Oh, yes.

213
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,119
Yes, I'm Kanzaki.

214
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,820
Kanzaki, I'm going to kill you for sure.

215
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,720
How did he know I was here?

216
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,519
Oh, Kanzaki?

217
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,219
You were here too?

218
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,219
What's wrong? You look pale.

219
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,119
I got really scared so I decided to tell boss about it.

220
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,319
He told me that I should have a detective check it out.

221
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,419
So, that's why you came to ask Pops to help you out.

222
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,219
And, about your stomachache...

223
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,219
Nothing was wrong with me until I came to work.

224
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,419
Around 9:00 am, I was making arrangements over tea.

225
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,919
Mr. Kanzaki.

226
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,219
I'd like Bekapon to hand out fliers in front of the station today.

227
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,319
What's wrong?

228
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,920
I'm sorry. I've got to go to the restroom.

229
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,419
I suddenly came down with a stomachache.

230
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,920
You have no idea how you got it?

231
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,120
Nope.

232
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,619
Yes, back then...

233
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,819
I was cleaning because I was asked to do so.

234
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,719
Oh... Is that right?

235
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,619
But, I was really shocked

236
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,719
because I got mixed up in the incident as soon as I was hired.

237
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,319
As soon as you were hired?

238
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,819
I just started working here from yesterday, you see.

239
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,019
I'm new here.

240
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,819
That's why she was chosen.

241
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,720
I get the picture.

242
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,119
So then...

243
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,719
If he were to hide it,

244
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,320
this room would be the only place...

245
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,320
Darn, where the heck are the yellow and red clothes?

246
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,619
I see.

247
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,220
That's why he...

248
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,120
"Beikado Supermarket."

249
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,620
Inspector! I hear you found out who the perpetrator is!

250
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,419
Just what are you talking about?

251
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,819
You're the one who called and said to get everybody together

252
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,920
because you figured out who the perpetrator was.

253
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,920
I got a call from you...

254
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,919
Bekapon...

255
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,620
It's the famous, Sleeping Kogoro!

256
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:50,719
Who is it that mistook Mr. Shimomura for me and stabbed him?

257
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,719
It was no mistake.

258
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,520
The perpetrator was after Mr. Shimomura to begin with.

259
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,119
Just what do you mean?

260
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,119
The perpetrator wanted to erase Mr. Shimomura from this world.

261
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,419
However, if he simply killed him,

262
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,619
from motive and so forth,

263
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,719
suspicion might be pointed at him.

264
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,619
So in order to avoid that,

265
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,919
he decided to fake it

266
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,119
to make it look as if the perpetrator mistakenly stabbed Mr. Shimomura

267
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,720
when actually wanting to kill Mr. Kanzaki.

268
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,519
If Mr. Shimomura coincidentally turned out to be the victim

269
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,519
because of a mistake,

270
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,420
we wouldn't check on Mr. Shimomura.

271
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,519
In other words,

272
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,819
this case was a calculated murder scheme to deceive the eyes of the police

273
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,119
by making it look like a mistaken target case.

274
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,520
Correct, Mr. Udagawa?

275
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,119
Boss?

276
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,519
But, since Mr. Shimomura is still not dead,

277
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,819
at this point it's not murder yet, only alleged murder.

278
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,419
Just what is your remark based on?

279
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,619
All circumstances speak for themselves!

280
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,619
Firstly, you called Mr. Kanzaki and warned him of the murder.

281
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,920
Kanzaki, I'm going to kill you for sure.

282
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,519
Oh, Kanzaki?

283
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,219
You're here too.

284
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,419
You mean you made that phone call, boss.

285
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,719
I don't know what the heck you're talking about!

286
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:26,419
Then, you made Mr. Kanzaki come and ask me for help.

287
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,319
Because you needed a witness who knew that

288
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,219
somebody was after Mr. Kanzaki's life.

289
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,419
And for that witness...

290
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,119
you used me because I'm a well known detective.

291
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,819
And today, you inserted laxative into Mr. Kanzaki's tea.

292
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,319
You then told Mr. Shimomura to wear Bekapon's outfit

293
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,419
as a substitute and schemed to kill him.

294
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,820
Die! Kanzaki!

295
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,819
To make it really look like a mistake,

296
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:06,119
you had to have somebody hear you yell, "Die, Kanzaki!"

297
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,519
That's why you told me to clean over there back then.

298
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,119
It was just a coincidence!

299
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,819
A coincidence...

300
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,819
Newcomer Teruko was just the person for that role.

301
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,019
Because if it were someone

302
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,419
who had been there for a long time,

303
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,019
the person may remember it to be Mr. Udagawa's voice.

304
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,219
After stabbing Mr. Shimomura,

305
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,620
you came fleeing into this break room.

306
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,319
Although you were in this room,

307
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,919
Mr. Kanzaki you were fast asleep.

308
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,619
Probably because of the sleeping pills

309
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,820
that were mixed into your drink.

310
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,419
When you changed into your clothes

311
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,119
after removing the balaclava and clothes you were wearing...

312
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,419
Oh, there you are, boss!

313
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,319
I came to check on how Mr. Kanzaki was doing.

314
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,919
He's fast asleep.

315
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,419
That's all a bunch of baloney!

316
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,819
Why on earth would I want to kill Mr. Shimonura?

317
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,219
I didn't have time to figure out what your motive was.

318
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,519
I had to hurry since I didn't want you

319
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,719
to get rid of the concrete evidence.

320
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,719
Concrete evidence, you mean the yellow top...

321
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,219
And red slacks.

322
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,419
And the balaclava.

323
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,119
Since there was commotion as soon as the incident happened,

324
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,919
you probably didn't have time to take it outside.

325
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,419
But, if he hid it somewhere,

326
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,419
why would he say what he did?

327
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:32,019
Boss! Let's have them make a thorough check.

328
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,319
Because there was no use looking for it in the store.

329
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,120
Correct, Mr. Udagawa?

330
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,419
Because you're still wearing it.

331
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,520
Wearing it?

332
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,019
That's why you can't take off your uniform.

333
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,619
Mr. Udagawa, you're sweating a lot too.

334
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,920
Oh, well... I have a slight cold, you see.

335
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,620
Let me go!

336
00:19:58,621 --> 00:19:59,920
Pardon me!

337
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,419
Reversible!

338
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,519
A yellow cloth was sewn on to the inside of his uniform.

339
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,219
Which means...

340
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,019
Just as expected.

341
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,119
He didn't change into something else.

342
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,819
All he did after committing the crime was turn his top

343
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,319
and slacks inside out.

344
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,919
I got it about his clothes, but what about the balaclava?

345
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,719
The only thing thinkable is that Mr. Udagawa is still wearing it...

346
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,320
Exactly!

347
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,620
I know it's nothing to laugh about but...

348
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,819
You shouldn't use something

349
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,419
that's supposed to be worn on your head as underwear!

350
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,219
You know...

351
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,519
You'll be punished by the gods.

352
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,219
Why?

353
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,419
I didn't know where else to hide it.

354
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,319
Not that. I mean, why did you stab Mr. Shimomura?

355
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,119
You just got an offer to become

356
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,019
the store manager for Beikado store number five that is opening soon.

357
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,419
It was an important time for me.

358
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,619
But that Shimomura!

359
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,319
He found out that I was embezzling cash sales

360
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,819
and told me he was going to turn me in.

361
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,319
So, I had no choice but to kill him

362
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,719
if I wanted the position that I always longed for, did I?

363
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,620
You idiot!

364
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,719
Yeah, Megure here.

365
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,519
I see. I got it...

366
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,919
Mr. Shimomura seems to have made it.

367
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,019
I'm glad.

368
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,719
Yeah.

369
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,019
It seems that the outfit was thick,

370
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,619
so the stab wasn't lethal.

371
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,419
I should've stabbed him deeper.

372
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,719
What?

373
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,019
Take this unsightly character away right this minute!

374
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,020
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

375
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,120
Very true. He sure is an unsightly perpetrator.

376
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,819
Everybody, gather round.

377
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,119
Take a look at this bandage.

378
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,619
Everybody's Bekapon is invincible.

379
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,219
Beka...

380
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,119
Everybody's Bakapon's bandaged...

381
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,720
Everything's for sale, Bekapon.

382
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,719
"Next Episode."

383
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,419
The whereabouts of a suspect being convoyed,

384
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,719
along with the Officer he was with has become unknown.

385
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,919
What the heck is Takagi doing?

386
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,119
You're Ms. Chie Konaka?

387
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,719
I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri.

388
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,620
What's this? Something's not right.

389
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,220
Next Conan, "Handcuffed Officer Takagi on the Run"
