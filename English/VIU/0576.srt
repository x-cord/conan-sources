1
00:00:01,109 --> 00:00:05,809
Pops and I accompany Ran and Sonoko shopping,

2
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:08,609
and end up finding the dead body of a woman

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,709
in the toilet compartment of a restroom in a park.

4
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:13,609
We witnessed the victim, Ms. Mihiro Kuze

5
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:16,209
dressed in Goth Lolita fashion,

6
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:19,309
at a coffee shop in Shinjuku.

7
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:23,209
Although Mihiro sits down once,

8
00:00:23,209 --> 00:00:25,609
she gets up to go to the restroom outside the shop

9
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,909
even before placing her order.

10
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:31,609
Just then, Yuika, Mihiro's friend

11
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:33,909
that she had been waiting for, shows up,

12
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:37,509
but Mihiro never came back to her seat.

13
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:40,709
Ms. Shodo is counted as one of the suspects,

14
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,309
but she had a perfect alibi.

15
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,109
However...

16
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:52,409
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

17
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:54,409
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

18
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:56,409
Murder case because of warped friendship.

19
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:58,809
Keep on the look-out for costume that Ran and Sonoko are wearing!

20
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,609
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:02,609
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,609
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:50,766
"Alibi of the Black Dress (Part 2)"

24
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,479
This lady that came first...

25
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,679
Did she order anything?

26
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:57,279
No, nothing.

27
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:59,179
She was looking through the menu

28
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,279
before going to use the restroom though.

29
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:05,979
Can I borrow this menu, then?

30
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:08,179
-Yes, sir. -I don't think you'll find...

31
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:10,579
-Mihiro's fingerprints on it. -Huh?

32
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:12,179
"Yuka Shodo (26)" -I accidentally spilled water

33
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:14,279
out of the glass cup on the table.

34
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,379
When I tried to pick that cup up,

35
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,279
I carelessly placed the menu on top of the table

36
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:20,679
soaked with water and wet it,

37
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:22,879
so I wiped it later.

38
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,279
Of course, I wiped the table and the sofa

39
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:27,879
where the water splashed on to.

40
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:32,679
No trace of Mihiro having come here would be left behind.

41
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:37,079
Which means that I'm the killer?

42
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,979
Inspector?

43
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:40,679
No.

44
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,579
But it's a problem.

45
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,779
The cup that Mihiro was holding

46
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:45,879
dropped to the floor and cracked too.

47
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,379
Cracked?

48
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:53,979
If it cracked, isn't it still here, the cup?

49
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:56,679
Yes! Inside the incombustibles trash bag.

50
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,379
Is this the debris?

51
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,479
Yes, sir.

52
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,679
This is the only cup that cracked today.

53
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,779
Let's call forensics and have them check it.

54
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:11,979
If you like, would you like to go to the shop

55
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:13,479
that Mihiro bought her clothes at too?

56
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:16,479
I have an idea of what shop Mihiro would go to.

57
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,079
Yes, it's her.

58
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,479
She came yesterday at sundown to buy it.

59
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:28,079
-Alone? -Yes, sir.

60
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,179
Then, is she the only one who bought that outfit?

61
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:34,579
No. This is an original of our shop

62
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:35,579
that we put on the shelves yesterday.

63
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:36,779
It's really popular,

64
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:39,579
so it sold out on the same day.

65
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:43,779
Did you see her among the customers who came to buy the outfit?

66
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:44,979
I wonder.

67
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:48,179
-I couldn't have bought it, could I? -Huh?

68
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:49,779
I was on a business trip in Fukuoka last night,

69
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,479
and while riding a cab,

70
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,679
I got a call from Mihiro saying that she bought the outfit!

71
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:57,679
In Fukuoka...

72
00:04:57,679 --> 00:05:00,779
Yes! I arrived in Haneda Airport this afternoon,

73
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:03,579
and went straight to that coffee shop in Shinjuku!

74
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,079
Really?

75
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,179
You can go ahead and check on it if you want!

76
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:10,679
I was on that plane together with a colleague of mine!

77
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:12,479
If that's true,

78
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,379
she didn't have a chance to buy that outfit.

79
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:17,779
But she's probably the culprit.

80
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,179
How on earth did she do it?

81
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:21,879
Hey, Conan.

82
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:24,079
Come here.

83
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,679
I borrowed the fitting room in this shop and changed.

84
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,879
Hey, hey.

85
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,579
Wearing Lolita clothes when there was a murder?

86
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:34,479
How do you like it?

87
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,879
Is it funny, after all?

88
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,579
It... It's not funny, but...

89
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:46,379
Oh no! She looks cute!

90
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:51,879
God! It's no use showing this kid, it's a waste of time!

91
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,879
How come you're both wearing the same outfit?

92
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,179
You know nothing about things like this, do you?

93
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:02,579
This is a type of fashion and...

94
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:06,879
I see.

95
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,379
Mihiro's fingerprints were found on the cracked piece of glass cup.

96
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:13,879
Which means, she's got a perfect alibi.

97
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:16,779
Then, will you please let me go already?

98
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,979
It's getting pretty late, too.

99
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,479
It's already pretty late.

100
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,479
I see. That's how it is.

101
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,679
Huh? A strangely clean place?

102
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:36,479
I don't think there was such a place

103
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,179
inside the toilet where the body was found.

104
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,179
Did you check the other toilet compartments too?

105
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:43,479
No, not yet.

106
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,779
The toilet right next to it.

107
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,779
Only the cover of the toilet paper holder in that compartment

108
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,379
was strangely really clean.

109
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,879
There!

110
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,179
I'm leaving then!

111
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:03,179
I've got to inform my other friends about Mihiro's death too.

112
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:05,479
No, I can't let you go just yet.

113
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:07,679
Something keeps bothering me.

114
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:09,379
I can't understand why Mihiro who was expecting

115
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:12,279
to meet you at the coffee shop in Shinjuku,

116
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,979
left to go to the restroom

117
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,679
and left the shop as well without waiting for you.

118
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:19,479
Then, for some reason was found killed

119
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:22,079
in a restroom in a park in Harajuku.

120
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,679
How should I know?

121
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,979
All I can say is,

122
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:30,479
about 10 minutes after Mihiro left to go to the restroom,

123
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,979
I went into that coffee shop

124
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:34,179
and kept calling Mihiro on her cell phone

125
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:36,979
because she didn't come back. I continued to call her,

126
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:38,579
but she didn't answer her cell phone,

127
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:41,079
and then when I finally got through...

128
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:46,179
the person who answered was you, Inspector!

129
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:50,579
Or what? Do you still suspect that I'm the culprit?

130
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:53,379
No, it's not that.

131
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:57,279
Inspector, Ms. Shodo is clear!

132
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,579
You mentioned a while ago, didn't you?

133
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,879
That if Ms. Shodo were the killer,

134
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,279
after Mihiro left to go to the restroom,

135
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,379
she would've had to call her and tell her to come to the park.

136
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:07,779
Then, after killing her,

137
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,679
Ms. Shodo would have to return to that coffee shop.

138
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:13,679
It takes more than 30 minutes from that coffee shop

139
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:16,579
in Shinjuku to the park in Harajuku round trip.

140
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,379
It's impossible for Ms. Shodo to come to the shop 10 minutes

141
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:22,279
after Mihiro left the shop.

142
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:26,379
Mihiro's fingerprints were detected on the glass cup, weren't they?

143
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:31,779
If so, that is clear fact that Mihiro came to the shop!

144
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:35,979
But I wonder why Mihiro touched that cup?

145
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:38,979
Huh? If they serve you water at a coffee shop,

146
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:40,879
you'd most naturally drink it, wouldn't you?

147
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,379
But that cup that this lady dropped

148
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:48,579
had no lipstick on it anywhere.

149
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:54,879
Remember? The lady dressed in Goth Lolita fashion

150
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,279
was wearing pitch black lipstick, right?

151
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,879
That's true.

152
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,879
I don't think you know, sonny

153
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,479
but it's manners for a lady to inconspicuously

154
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,779
wipe off from the cup any lipstick that is on the cup with her fingers.

155
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:12,979
But I don't think there was any trace of lipstick

156
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,379
being wiped off with her fingers either.

157
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:20,879
Then, when Mihiro hit the cup as she opened the menu,

158
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,879
maybe she just moved it to the side?

159
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,779
It could be that she didn't drink out of the cup at all,

160
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:27,979
but rather got up right away to the restroom.

161
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:30,979
Even when I returned the menu,

162
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:35,279
I hit the cup, dropped and cracked it.

163
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,579
But you were lucky that the cup cracked.

164
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,379
Lucky?

165
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:45,379
Because if it didn't crack,

166
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:47,679
you would've been asked by the Inspector

167
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,779
to come to the scene of the crime.

168
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,179
And if after you left the coffee shop,

169
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:54,779
the employee cleared the cup away, and washed it,

170
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,579
don't you think the fingerprints would've come off?

171
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:02,279
And, why did you sit on the same side

172
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,979
where the Goth Lolita woman was sitting?

173
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:08,179
Usually, when you wait for somebody and meet them,

174
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:11,179
you sit in the seat opposite them, don't you?

175
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,579
That's...

176
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,379
If you didn't sit on that side,

177
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:17,579
you wouldn't have cracked the cup either.

178
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:21,079
You idiot! Who cares where you sit!

179
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,979
Besides, the cracked cup may not have been washed,

180
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:25,879
but it's for sure it would've been thrown away!

181
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,879
And if it's collected by the dump truck

182
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,779
and taken to Yumenoshima or something, that's it.

183
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,679
Just how many officers do you think is needed...

184
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,679
-to look for it from within the heap of trash! -Troublesome.

185
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:42,979
Hey, Mouri!

186
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:44,379
Don't tell me it's come again.

187
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:47,679
Mouri... The Sleeping Kogoro?

188
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,679
Indeed.

189
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,479
I won't let this case go to sleep, though.

190
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:57,379
I'll explain it so it makes sense.

191
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:58,979
After strangling Ms. Mihiro Kuze to death

192
00:10:58,979 --> 00:11:01,179
in the restroom in the park at Harajuku,

193
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:04,279
you went right away to the coffee shop in Shinjuku

194
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:07,679
to establish an alibi for yourself.

195
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,079
Isn't that right, Ms. Yuika Shodo?

196
00:11:16,172 --> 00:11:18,672
Hey, hey, wait a minute there, Mr. Mouri.

197
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:20,872
You also said that

198
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:23,372
it'll take at least 30 minutes round trip

199
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:25,372
to get from the park restroom to the coffee shop,

200
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:28,272
so how could Ms. Shodo who came to the shop

201
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,572
10 minutes after Mihiro went out to use the restroom, have done it?

202
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:33,972
It's true that if Mihiro was killed after she stood up

203
00:11:33,972 --> 00:11:37,372
to go to the restroom, it'd be impossible.

204
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:41,972
But if Mihiro was killed before she came to the shop then...

205
00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:43,872
it's possible!

206
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:46,672
Before she came to the coffee shop...

207
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,172
Which means that the one who came to the shop...

208
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:53,072
Yes. I think that maybe you felt the same too

209
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:55,372
when you saw Mihiro's body.

210
00:11:55,372 --> 00:11:58,472
I'm sure you though Goth Lolita fashion is flashy and very strong.

211
00:11:58,472 --> 00:12:00,172
The employee at the coffee shop

212
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:02,672
along with us, who were there as customers of the shop,

213
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:05,872
were taken aback by the strong impact of her appearance.

214
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:08,172
So, we don't really remember what she actually looked like

215
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:10,972
and can't acknowledge her!

216
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:14,372
No one would ever imagine that the office lady type woman

217
00:12:14,372 --> 00:12:17,772
that came into the shop 10 minutes later

218
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:19,572
was in fact the same person

219
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,772
as the one who came in wearing the Goth Lolita outfit!

220
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:25,672
Huh? What on earth are you talking about?

221
00:12:25,672 --> 00:12:27,372
You said that Mihiro's fingerprints

222
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,972
were found on the glass cup of the coffee shop!

223
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:31,872
It's no surprise!

224
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:34,472
Because that cup

225
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:37,772
is one that you stole from the coffee shop beforehand!

226
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:40,672
Right.

227
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:45,172
You probably invited Mihiro over to your house,

228
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:48,572
poured a drink into that cup and served it to her.

229
00:12:48,572 --> 00:12:51,872
You did so to get her fingerprints on the cup!

230
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:55,472
You hid the cup that was placed before you

231
00:12:55,472 --> 00:12:57,572
when you first came into the shop wearing the Goth Lolita

232
00:12:57,572 --> 00:12:59,772
into your bag,

233
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:04,372
and switched it with the cup with Mihiro's fingerprints on it.

234
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:07,672
10 minutes after that, you changed your make-up and clothes

235
00:13:07,672 --> 00:13:08,972
and came to the shop.

236
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:10,772
You deliberately sat in the same seat you sat in

237
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:13,072
when you first came to the shop

238
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:17,172
so that you could deliberately drop the cup that you had switched.

239
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,072
You wanted to splash the water onto the floor

240
00:13:19,072 --> 00:13:20,372
and crack the cup.

241
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:26,472
By wiping the place where you were seated 10 minutes ago,

242
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,972
you wanted to create a situation,

243
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:30,472
in which things wouldn't look strange

244
00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:32,472
even if traces of Mihiro couldn't be found where she was sitting.

245
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:33,872
In order to use the cup

246
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:36,972
as the only evidence showing that Mihiro came.

247
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:38,372
You wanted to crack it

248
00:13:38,372 --> 00:13:40,772
because then the cracked pieces would have to be picked up,

249
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:42,072
and your fingerprints would also be detected

250
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,172
on the glass cup you switched,

251
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:45,472
so you could deceive everyone.

252
00:13:45,472 --> 00:13:47,072
But you said a while ago that

253
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:49,172
if it cracked, it would be thrown away.

254
00:13:49,172 --> 00:13:54,972
That is, if Mihiro's body was found 2-3 days later!

255
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:56,472
I see!

256
00:13:56,472 --> 00:14:00,072
That's why you kept on calling Mihiro repeatedly!

257
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,372
If the phone keeps ringing

258
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:03,672
and no one answers or comes out of the toilet,

259
00:14:03,672 --> 00:14:06,572
somebody is bound to check inside sooner or later!

260
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:11,272
The more so, if it's just the time the toilet gets crowded!

261
00:14:11,272 --> 00:14:12,972
If Mihiro is found,

262
00:14:12,972 --> 00:14:17,772
the police would suspect you, who kept calling her,

263
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:20,872
and go over to the coffee shop where you promised to meet her,

264
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:25,072
and you would be able to show the cracked glass cup to the police

265
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,672
before it's disposed of as incombustible trash!

266
00:14:27,672 --> 00:14:29,372
Hold it!

267
00:14:29,372 --> 00:14:33,572
Have you all forgotten that Mihiro came last night

268
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,972
to buy the Goth Lolita clothes she was wearing, alone?

269
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:40,472
Moreover, it was sold yesterday and only for one day!

270
00:14:40,472 --> 00:14:41,872
Since I came back from my business trip

271
00:14:41,872 --> 00:14:44,672
in Fukuoka this afternoon,

272
00:14:44,672 --> 00:14:46,172
I couldn't have bought it!

273
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:49,272
The point is not who bought it.

274
00:14:49,272 --> 00:14:52,072
But, rather, how many outfits were bought.

275
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:58,272
Excuse me. Did Mihiro buy just one outfit like that?

276
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,372
No, she bought two.

277
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:02,872
She said that she could only come at sundown

278
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:07,272
so to reserve and keep two outfits for her.

279
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:09,372
It was a popular outfit

280
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:11,572
that we put an advance advertisement out for,

281
00:15:11,572 --> 00:15:13,672
so she wanted us to keep it for her before it sold out.

282
00:15:13,672 --> 00:15:16,872
After the police came to confirm with the salesclerk

283
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:19,772
whether Mihiro came alone to buy the outfit,

284
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:21,572
you...

285
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:24,572
Then, was she the only one who bought that outfit?

286
00:15:25,472 --> 00:15:28,372
You interrupted the conversation, didn't you?

287
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:30,272
You did so to stop the salesclerk

288
00:15:30,272 --> 00:15:36,572
from mentioning that Mihiro bought two outfits, didn't you?

289
00:15:36,572 --> 00:15:38,972
You wanted people to place attention on who bought the outfit,

290
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:43,172
rather than how many outfits were bought.

291
00:15:43,172 --> 00:15:44,672
Am I wrong?

292
00:15:46,272 --> 00:15:48,272
But, Mr. Mouri...

293
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:51,772
I understand that Yuika and Mihiro were the same size

294
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:53,972
and that Yuika made Mihiro bring her

295
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:57,972
the outfit she bought yesterday, over to her today.

296
00:15:57,972 --> 00:16:00,972
But if Yuika had to completely copy the clothes,

297
00:16:00,972 --> 00:16:03,672
make-up and hairstyle of Mihiro after killing her,

298
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,672
wouldn't it take up a lot of time,

299
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:09,172
that she would practically have no time to establish an alibi?

300
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:12,672
It can't be that they both promised each other

301
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,972
to wear the same outfit before the killing either, could it?

302
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:17,172
-Oh, as to that... -Exactly!

303
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:19,672
Besides, maybe she bought the two outfits

304
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:22,372
for herself and not for me.

305
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:23,972
Because she really liked it, and was keeping one more

306
00:16:23,972 --> 00:16:26,172
so she could wear the other one if one of them get dirty!

307
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:28,472
Right? There are people like that, aren't there?

308
00:16:28,472 --> 00:16:30,972
Well, yes.

309
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:33,072
As to that mystery,

310
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:37,372
my daughter and her friend will resolve it.

311
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,672
Ran and Sonoko!

312
00:16:39,672 --> 00:16:41,572
What're you hiding for?

313
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:42,672
Hey.

314
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:44,472
That idiot!

315
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:46,272
Pops says to come out quickly

316
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,972
and show us your cute outfit!

317
00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:51,872
-What? -Oh, goodness.

318
00:16:54,072 --> 00:16:55,472
Ta-da!

319
00:16:57,772 --> 00:17:00,372
What's with that look?

320
00:17:00,372 --> 00:17:02,272
Moreover, it's the same clothes!

321
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:05,072
That's called the twin fashion.

322
00:17:05,072 --> 00:17:06,972
Twin fashion?

323
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:10,172
It's a fashion referring to good friends wearing matching clothes,

324
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:11,672
the same hairstyles, make-up

325
00:17:11,672 --> 00:17:13,672
and even carrying the same kind of bag,

326
00:17:13,672 --> 00:17:16,872
so they virtually look like twins!

327
00:17:16,872 --> 00:17:18,872
I thought that the person called Mihiro

328
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:23,072
was going to enjoy twin fashion with a friend of hers.

329
00:17:23,072 --> 00:17:24,472
I see.

330
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:27,872
You told Mihiro that you'd like to wear twin fashion,

331
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:31,472
and right after changing clothes in that park restroom,

332
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:35,372
you strangled her to death!

333
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:37,672
Well, I wonder about that?

334
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:40,472
If you want to substantiate that, show me, will you?

335
00:17:40,472 --> 00:17:44,572
-Proof that I did it. -There is proof...

336
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:47,772
on your left arm.

337
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:51,272
When you looked at your wristwatch a while ago...

338
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:54,072
It's getting late...

339
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:56,572
You stopped part way

340
00:17:56,572 --> 00:18:00,172
and looked at your cell phone watch, didn't you?

341
00:18:00,172 --> 00:18:04,172
You probably hesitated because when you strangled Mihiro,

342
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:07,972
she scratched your left arm and the mark was there.

343
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:12,072
You've got a scratch.

344
00:18:12,072 --> 00:18:14,472
No! I did this myself when I was half sleeping!

345
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:16,672
Yes, you have all the reasons in the world

346
00:18:16,672 --> 00:18:18,872
to justify that scratch of yours.

347
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:23,872
Besides no skin traces were found on Mihiro's fingertips,

348
00:18:23,872 --> 00:18:27,872
so she must've scratched you with her fake nails.

349
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:30,472
It would be impossible to prove that you did it

350
00:18:30,472 --> 00:18:32,172
as long as the fake nails are disposed of.

351
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:35,572
That's why despite the fact that

352
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:40,172
you had to get away from the scene of the crime as soon as possible.

353
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:42,872
All the fake nails on both her hands

354
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,072
were completely removed using a nail remover.

355
00:18:47,272 --> 00:18:49,472
Why...

356
00:18:49,472 --> 00:18:53,172
You wanted to hide the fact that you were scratched,

357
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:57,672
along with the fact that the blood that dripped from the scratch

358
00:18:57,672 --> 00:19:02,372
fell onto a certain place in the toilet!

359
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:04,772
And just where is that certain place?

360
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:07,772
Officer Takagi should be calling soon about that.

361
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:13,072
Yes, Megure here.

362
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:17,572
What? Blood reaction was found

363
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:19,572
in the compartment next to the murder site?

364
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:23,772
Only the toilet paper cover here had no dust on it,

365
00:19:23,772 --> 00:19:26,272
so I had forensics check it,

366
00:19:26,272 --> 00:19:27,872
and luminol reaction was detected!

367
00:19:27,872 --> 00:19:30,972
And? What about the result of the blood test?

368
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:34,072
It wasn't the victim's blood,

369
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,372
so it's probably the culprit's.

370
00:19:36,372 --> 00:19:38,972
Most probably this is the compartment

371
00:19:38,972 --> 00:19:40,372
where the actual murder took place,

372
00:19:40,372 --> 00:19:43,072
but since her blood dripped,

373
00:19:43,072 --> 00:19:46,972
I think she moved the body to the next compartment.

374
00:19:46,972 --> 00:19:49,172
That seems to be the story!

375
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:53,072
I would like to take your blood and have it checked.

376
00:19:53,972 --> 00:19:56,872
Take it if you want.

377
00:19:56,872 --> 00:20:01,172
As for me, Mihiro took all and everything from me

378
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:03,472
and I don't even have blood left for my nose to bleed.

379
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:04,972
Take everything?

380
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:06,372
You mean like your boyfriend?

381
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,172
Yes, he's one of them, too.

382
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:12,572
The first time it happened was when I was 20, I think?

383
00:20:12,572 --> 00:20:14,072
I was down and out,

384
00:20:14,072 --> 00:20:16,872
but to make things worse, I was fired from my company

385
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:18,772
and evicted from my apartment.

386
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:22,472
In the end, for some reason, my friends all pulled away from me.

387
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,272
Eventually, the only one left was

388
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:27,272
my childhood friend, Mihiro.

389
00:20:27,272 --> 00:20:32,072
She got me a job at her parent's company.

390
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:33,272
And I also started to live in her condo

391
00:20:33,272 --> 00:20:35,972
after she introduced me there.

392
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:37,872
Rather than take things from you,

393
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:41,072
she seems to have looked after you!

394
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:45,572
Yes. I used to think so until just recently, too.

395
00:20:45,572 --> 00:20:47,172
Until I found out that I got fired,

396
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:51,172
was evicted from my place and lost my friends...

397
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:55,472
All because of the things that Mihiro did behind my back!

398
00:20:55,472 --> 00:20:56,472
What?

399
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:57,972
Why would she do something like that?

400
00:20:57,972 --> 00:20:59,072
I wonder.

401
00:20:59,072 --> 00:21:02,972
I think she just wanted to make sure our bond wouldn't break?

402
00:21:02,972 --> 00:21:07,472
Because I was the only best friend she had.

403
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:12,372
But I was betrayed.

404
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,772
And I believed her.

405
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:19,372
That's why I took from her this time.

406
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:52,772
You two who are living in a fairy tale world

407
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:55,072
better be careful, too.

408
00:22:55,072 --> 00:22:58,972
There's nothing more uncertain and fragile as friendship.

409
00:22:58,972 --> 00:23:01,272
Well, let's hear the rest of story out at the station.

410
00:23:01,272 --> 00:23:04,272
Are you nuts?

411
00:23:04,272 --> 00:23:06,772
That's why it's good, because it's uncertain and fragile!

412
00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:08,972
That's why when your heart and heart connects,

413
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,772
you feel warm inside!

414
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:12,672
If it were super hard like a steel plate

415
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:14,872
working out the way you want it to,

416
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:17,572
you could never feel the warmth!

417
00:23:20,172 --> 00:23:22,072
Right.

418
00:23:22,072 --> 00:23:26,472
If I could just have talked to her like you do,

419
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:29,672
maybe we could've have had

420
00:23:29,672 --> 00:23:32,372
a warm relationship like old times too.

421
00:23:39,972 --> 00:23:42,172
Awesome, Sonoko!

422
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,972
Yeah!

423
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:45,172
I mean... but saying something like that,

424
00:23:45,172 --> 00:23:46,772
dressed the way you are, I don't know.

425
00:23:50,672 --> 00:23:53,572
Where is everybody?

426
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:01,572
It smells like almond.

427
00:24:01,572 --> 00:24:02,672
What?

428
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:05,072
Don't tell me that there was poison in this bottle?

429
00:24:05,072 --> 00:24:07,372
We're the Youth Detective Squad!

430
00:24:07,372 --> 00:24:09,472
We've come to help out with the investigation!

431
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,972
A girl called Mayu, who looks like me

432
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:14,172
was caught in a landslide?

433
00:24:14,172 --> 00:24:16,772
How'd you get that flashlight?

434
00:24:16,772 --> 00:24:19,372
If I remember correctly, back then...

435
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:27,872
