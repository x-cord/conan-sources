1
00:00:14,484 --> 00:00:16,430
Snow!

2
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,984
So much snow.

3
00:00:18,508 --> 00:00:21,588
Hey. Be careful!

4
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,708
Welcome to Villa Ice Room.

5
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:28,401
Hello, we're glad to be here.

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,680
Hello.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,380
Hey, you guys. Come over and say hello!

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,713
Hello!

9
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,434
-Let's make snowballs. -Okay.

10
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:43,034
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,546
It's okay.

12
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:49,433
We used to like playing in the snow when we were small, too.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,334
That's right, children should play energetically outside, healthy is best!

14
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,847
I think they're too energetic.

15
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:58,468
There are some who lack energy, too.

16
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:03,067
Snowball fighting. Looks like fun.

17
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,747
-Bullseye! -You hit him!

18
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:13,067
Now you've done it, Genta!

19
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:15,867
You're still green.

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,179
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

21
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:22,179
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

22
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:25,947
The clue disappears in the snow. What is the trick that was left behind?

23
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:27,480
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,446
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:31,900
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:15,229
"Lover Vanishes in the Blizzard."

27
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:32,029
There!

28
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:36,375
Aren't you snowball fighting, Ai?

29
00:03:36,495 --> 00:03:40,196
I pass. I'm not at home snowball fighting.

30
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,296
Oh? Then, what's that?

31
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:47,963
I'm not playing. It's artistry.

32
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:51,728
Artistry...

33
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:54,378
Got him, got him!

34
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:56,332
You did it, Ayumi.

35
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:57,942
Gosh.

36
00:03:58,062 --> 00:03:59,942
Where's Genta?

37
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:02,042
I don't see him.

38
00:04:02,162 --> 00:04:03,996
Genta...

39
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,195
There!

40
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,394
He went to the restroom to wipe is face.

41
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:17,828
You're a devil.

42
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:20,608
Genta's sure taking long.

43
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,861
I wonder if he's okay?

44
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:26,461
Okay, I'll go check.

45
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:35,962
Genta!

46
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:39,996
Don't be ridiculous!

47
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:45,042
Juri, I'm against it.

48
00:04:45,162 --> 00:04:47,030
Split up with this guy!

49
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:49,529
Please stop it, Aya.

50
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:53,928
You have no right to say that to me.

51
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:56,862
-Why you! -Shut up!

52
00:05:01,062 --> 00:05:02,963
Wait, Masahiko!

53
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:09,274
Juri. Are you all right?

54
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:12,228
You're awful, Aya.

55
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,179
I'm sorry you had to see that.

56
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:25,729
Who was that?

57
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:30,129
Masahiko Fujita, Juri's boyfriend.

58
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:34,508
He's a notorious local.

59
00:05:34,628 --> 00:05:39,195
Ryoko and I are both against them going with each other. But, Juri...

60
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:45,496
-Genta! -Conan!

61
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:48,496
You still have snow on your face.

62
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:50,262
Oh, no.

63
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:52,675
Besides, the bathroom is here.

64
00:05:52,795 --> 00:05:54,629
I see.

65
00:05:55,628 --> 00:05:58,761
What's with him?

66
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:10,029
What're you doing?

67
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:13,274
Nothing.

68
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:15,228
Children shouldn't come in here.

69
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:18,396
It's dangerous because there are things like knives here.

70
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:20,362
Okay.

71
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:26,162
You're something, Ai!

72
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:29,208
How nicely made.

73
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:31,642
It's bold but delicate.

74
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:33,862
It's indeed artistic!

75
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:36,162
Well, I guess it's pretty well done!

76
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:39,362
You seem to be enjoying yourself, too.

77
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:44,562
Let's go back. I'm getting hungry.

78
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:50,062
Hey!

79
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,075
Aya!

80
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:55,742
-Did you enjoy playing in the snow? -Yep, it was fun.

81
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:59,862
-It was fantastic. -You should've come play, too.

82
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,896
We adults got other things to do!

83
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:08,595
Thank you all so much for waiting.

84
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:13,729
You made all this?

85
00:07:15,062 --> 00:07:17,563
Ryoko's a super cook!

86
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:21,241
-The two younger ones are no good at all though! -How dare you!

87
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:25,561
Well, well... Let's eat.

88
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,274
Let's eat.

89
00:07:27,394 --> 00:07:30,061
Dig in.

90
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,995
Aren't you eating, Ayumi?

91
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:39,708
It smells like garlic.

92
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:42,928
I don't want to get stink because I have to spend the night here.

93
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:45,608
You're right.

94
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:47,375
But it's strange.

95
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:50,528
There doesn't seem to be any dishes here that have garlic in it.

96
00:07:54,762 --> 00:07:58,463
-Wow, am I filled. -It was good.

97
00:07:58,595 --> 00:08:02,096
-It was really delicious! -Thank you.

98
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:03,496
That's right!

99
00:08:03,628 --> 00:08:06,141
Juri, it's time for your medicine. Did you drink it?

100
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:09,928
Oh, no. Thank you, Aya.

101
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,608
Don't forget, Juri.

102
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:15,608
It's okay that she's easygoing, but she's still such a baby.

103
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:19,208
No! What shall I do? I can't find my medicine.

104
00:08:19,328 --> 00:08:23,162
-What's up? -I can't find it. My medicine...

105
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:25,762
Did you look good?

106
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:27,451
Yep.

107
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:30,296
Do you really need that medicine?

108
00:08:31,062 --> 00:08:34,341
I think it's okay to miss drinking it,

109
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:37,262
but she's never missed drinking it before.

110
00:08:38,095 --> 00:08:40,042
I tell you, just what do you think you're doing?

111
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:43,529
Okay. I'll go get some at the town hospital.

112
00:08:44,062 --> 00:08:45,942
I'm sure they'll give a prescription there.

113
00:08:46,062 --> 00:08:48,441
But I can't make you do that.

114
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,429
I'm sorry, but can you do that?

115
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:53,308
Ryoko.

116
00:08:53,428 --> 00:08:56,728
Give me a chance to look good sometimes, will you?

117
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:58,696
Masahiko.

118
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:01,229
Okay. Please, then.

119
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:07,130
Okay. I'll be right back.

120
00:09:07,728 --> 00:09:10,162
-Be careful. -I will.

121
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:27,196
-It's snowing pretty heavily. -Yes.

122
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:32,663
Yes, Villa Ice Room.

123
00:09:33,229 --> 00:09:35,763
Yes, that's right.

124
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:39,396
Huh? Masahiko isn't there yet?

125
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:42,929
No joke? He should've been there long ago.

126
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:45,362
I'll try call him.

127
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:49,061
Okay.

128
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:51,838
Well?

129
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:54,109
No good. I can't get through.

130
00:09:54,229 --> 00:09:56,663
Don't tell me something happened?

131
00:09:56,828 --> 00:10:00,162
Even to go out in search of him, it won't be easy in this snow.

132
00:10:09,195 --> 00:10:11,595
Masahiko's car is here.

133
00:10:11,962 --> 00:10:13,541
Did he walk there?

134
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:16,009
Well, the forecast said it would snow.

135
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:19,529
Maybe he thought it'd be dangerous to take the car.

136
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:22,496
Masahiko!

137
00:10:23,394 --> 00:10:25,228
Masahiko!

138
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:32,395
Don't tell me...

139
00:10:35,495 --> 00:10:36,528
That's...

140
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:52,802
I see. Okay.

141
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:56,767
It seems the police can't get here for a while because of the snow.

142
00:10:57,233 --> 00:11:00,233
-They said to preserve the scene as is. -Okay.

143
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,500
I wonder if he slipped or something.

144
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:07,967
I guess so. The soil is scraped.

145
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,868
He probably fell from there.

146
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,034
Well, it was probably an accident.

147
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:29,167
The place where Masahiko fell from...

148
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,167
Is anything wrong?

149
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:34,567
Isn't the snow accumulated a little odd just over there?

150
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,533
It looks like it's high on the side of the mountain

151
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,233
and lower on the side of the cliff.

152
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,568
True.

153
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,881
Nothing's odd about it at all.

154
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:48,101
More snow accumulates on the side where there's not much sunshine.

155
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,600
That's true, but...

156
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:55,001
Hey, look out!

157
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:01,401
-See, I told you so! -Are you okay?

158
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:04,734
Yeah, I'm fine.

159
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:09,200
This is...

160
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:11,901
What's wrong?

161
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Isn't it strange after all?

162
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,534
I wonder why Masahiko risked the danger of taking the rugged side road.

163
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:31,201
That's obvious because it's a shortcut.

164
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,567
-Really? -Yes.

165
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:38,068
Cars can't pass there, but it's closer to town if you take that road.

166
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,634
We rarely use it because it's dangerous, though.

167
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:44,601
Which means you went to town at sundown, too?

168
00:12:46,734 --> 00:12:48,068
Hey!

169
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,534
Oh, yeah. I had some things to do.

170
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,434
It's my fault. All because I lost my medicine, Masahiko...

171
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,213
It's nobody's fault.

172
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,667
This was just destined to be.

173
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:12,747
He was really unlucky, that man...

174
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:16,000
He shouldn't have taken the shortcut.

175
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,101
Is anybody there?

176
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,701
"Monaka Ice."

177
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:52,435
This is...

178
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:04,147
Are you all right?

179
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:09,514
Yes, thank you. I just had trouble breathing.

180
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:12,301
Should I go call your sisters?

181
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:15,147
I don't want to cause them too much worry

182
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:20,034
because they take care of me as if I were their daughter.

183
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,233
So much so that they'd do anything for you?

184
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:27,567
-Huh? -No, it's nothing.

185
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,767
There we go.

186
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:34,347
-This is heavy. -Put it down there.

187
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:36,567
What are you guys doing?

188
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,013
I told them they didn't have to, but...

189
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:43,200
We're going to protect them.

190
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:46,502
We don't want them to melt.

191
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,680
That's why they put them into the cooler box.

192
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
How kind of them.

193
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,067
I see! So that's the story.

194
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,001
What's up?

195
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:05,934
What did you want to talk to us about?

196
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:13,167
Well, I figured out the truth to this case.

197
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,800
Case? Wasn't that an accident?

198
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:20,447
No, Masahiko didn't die of an accident.

199
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:25,014
The perp set a trap at the side road and made him fall to his death.

200
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:27,180
It was premeditated murder!

201
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,333
-What? -What?

202
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:33,168
Wait a sec. There was no trap at the site, was there?

203
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:38,068
Besides, after Masahiko left, we all stayed together.

204
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:42,034
Nobody could've gotten rid of the trap!

205
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,680
-It wasn't gotten rid of. -What?

206
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,334
So the trap must still be at the site.

207
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,568
Only it can't be seen by you, though.

208
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:55,767
Yes, the perp used snow and ice.

209
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,114
First of all, the perp pushed the snow side road

210
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:02,614
towards the side of the mountain.

211
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:05,514
By doing this, it would make Masahiko avoid the mountain side

212
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:07,814
and go to the side of the cliff.

213
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,980
After restricting his path,

214
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,367
the perp placed a plate of ice that was made beforehand in the freezer.

215
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:19,147
I see.

216
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:21,967
Ice is easily hidden in the snow, and will eventually melt.

217
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:24,467
Nothing has to be gotten rid of since nothing will be left behind.

218
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,580
Wait! But if so...

219
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,367
Yeah, there will be no physical evidence.

220
00:16:30,534 --> 00:16:33,567
But the perp made a mistake.

221
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:38,174
This is what I found at the place Masahiko fell to his death.

222
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:44,235
-What's that? -And this.

223
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:49,781
That's the package of an ice cream sweets that went on sale just yesterday.

224
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:52,968
Right, and this is a piece of it.

225
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,380
It's the stuff that Genta took out of the freezer here and secretly ate.

226
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,934
How did you know?

227
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:02,367
I thought it was strange back then.

228
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:06,702
-Conan! -You still have snow on your face.

229
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:13,533
-Aren't you eating, Ayumi? -It smells like garlic.

230
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,913
Although there were no dishes with garlic, it smelled of garlic

231
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:20,467
because Genta was the source of it.

232
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:23,735
That's because I was hungry.

233
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:26,881
When Genta secret ate the ice cream,

234
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:30,013
the perp was freezing the water

235
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:33,133
in order to make the plate of ice.

236
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,600
The flakes of what Genta ate fell on it, and froze.

237
00:17:40,634 --> 00:17:45,468
The perp, without realizing this, used it as is.

238
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:48,268
There's no other reason that the flakes of this ice cream

239
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,368
would be at the scene of the crime!

240
00:17:51,634 --> 00:17:57,535
Right, the perp is none other than one of you who live here.

241
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:01,834
Yes, I got it! The perp is Aya!

242
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:07,734
It's true that we witnessed Aya who came back from the side road.

243
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,201
Hey!

244
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:13,868
Not holding anything and off her guard.

245
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,647
In order to set the trap, a cooler box to carry the plate of ice

246
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:22,781
and a shovel to move the snow are necessary.

247
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,635
It's impossible to go empty handed.

248
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:29,113
First of all, the perp would never call out to us.

249
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,633
Aya is not the perp. She's an eye-witness.

250
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:38,313
Aya probably just saw the real perp

251
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:40,614
come out of the side road.

252
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:43,614
Although she got worried and went to take a look at the side road,

253
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:47,501
she probably didn't notice the trap that the perp had set.

254
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,013
If she'd noticed it, she would've stopped the perp.

255
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:52,380
Wrong! I didn't see anything!

256
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,547
It's okay already, Aya.

257
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,347
That's right, I did it.

258
00:18:57,467 --> 00:19:00,247
I'm like a parent to Juri, you see.

259
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:03,934
I've got to get rid of all the bad guys that hang around you.

260
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06,701
Ryoko...

261
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:11,101
Please understand, Juri. It's for your sake.

262
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:14,447
This crime cannot be committed

263
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,567
unless the ice plate is taken out of the freezer.

264
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:23,280
Back then, the person who was in the kitchen at this time

265
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,734
should've been Ryoko... to make dinner.

266
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,134
She is the only one who could've committed the crime.

267
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:33,913
That's what I'd like to say but, Ryoko...

268
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:37,013
unfortunately, you're not the perp either.

269
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:38,166
Why not?

270
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,013
You love Juri as if she were your daughter.

271
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:46,903
You would never kill anyone in a way that would make Juri suffer for life.

272
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,967
You're just protecting her. The real perp, Juri!

273
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,814
-What? -I told you I'm the one who did it!

274
00:19:57,934 --> 00:20:02,101
Yes, that ice cream wrapper... I hid that, too.

275
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,567
-All to protect Juri, correct? -No!

276
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:09,347
Hey, Aya. You saw me at the side road at sundown, didn't you?

277
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:10,980
Hey, isn't that right?

278
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,233
Stop it!

279
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,946
Stop it already! Stop protecting me anymore.

280
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:19,667
You're right, I killed him!

281
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:27,000
That's the missing medicine, right?

282
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,567
You had it with you after all.

283
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,046
She lied.

284
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:37,714
But, back then, Masahiko volunteered to go get the medicine himself.

285
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:42,335
Besides, who knew that he was going to take the side road?

286
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:45,267
That's easy.

287
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,814
You're too persistent.

288
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:50,902
What do I have to do to get you to break up with me?

289
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:52,200
Okay.

290
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,714
I don't care if it's just an act.

291
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:57,814
Try saving me one last time.

292
00:20:57,934 --> 00:21:01,034
Then, I'll set you free with no strings attached.

293
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,333
That's when you instructed him to take the side road, correct?

294
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,847
Yes. I told him it was a shortcut.

295
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:12,301
What about that wink back then?

296
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:16,334
Let me look good sometimes!

297
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,680
It was a signal of confirmation.

298
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,800
"This is it, right?"

299
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,335
He's to blame!

300
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:29,767
Let's break up.

301
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,367
I've got another girl.

302
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:39,066
You're depressing, slow and boring.

303
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:42,433
They raised you wrong, maybe?

304
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:47,367
I... I couldn't forgive him.

305
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:50,201
I'm sorry.

306
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:22,934
Stink! It stinks of garlic!

307
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,480
-It's pretty good. -See?

308
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,434
-What shall I do? It's good. -Here, this is for you.

309
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:36,046
That's... Why's the real stuff here?

310
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:39,213
-And where's my ice cream? -We ate it!

311
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,733
What?

312
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:45,400
"Next Episode" -Ai was nowhere.

313
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:48,247
She should've been finished long ago if she went shopping.

314
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:50,367
I wonder what happened to her.

315
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:53,133
If anything were to have happened...

316
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,300
It belongs to the kitten that was fond of Ai.

317
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:11,814
Next Conan, "Confinement of Ai Haibara".

318
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,213
Next Conan's Hint:

319
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,466
"Canned juice."

320
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:34,280
You can't judge a man's worth with chocolate!

321
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,934
-Did you want it just a little, though? -Yes!
