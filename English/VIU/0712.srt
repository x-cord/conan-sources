1
00:00:02,523 --> 00:00:07,123
Well, thank you so much for everything.

2
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,973
Thanks so much for breakfast too.

3
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:11,073
No, not at all.

4
00:00:11,073 --> 00:00:14,973
Please forgive us for this was an unexpected occurrence!

5
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,273
Baloney.

6
00:00:16,273 --> 00:00:18,873
You were planning to spend the night here to begin with.

7
00:00:18,873 --> 00:00:21,373
Because you had change of clothes prepared too.

8
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:23,773
See you soon then, Ran.

9
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,973
See you.

10
00:00:24,973 --> 00:00:27,173
I'll be going too, then.

11
00:00:27,173 --> 00:00:30,173
Please drop by next time on your day off.

12
00:00:30,173 --> 00:00:32,973
Yes, sir, goodbye.

13
00:00:32,973 --> 00:00:34,073
Huh?

14
00:00:34,073 --> 00:00:36,373
Where are you going, Mr. Otaki?

15
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:38,173
Tokyo Station is this way.

16
00:00:38,173 --> 00:00:40,573
Yeah, you go on ahead.

17
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:44,673
I've got some business to finish off.

18
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:45,773
I see.

19
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:51,273
The place is on the border of Saitama and Gunma prefecture.

20
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:53,573
It's a western style mansion in the remote mountains.

21
00:00:53,573 --> 00:00:55,473
Tomorrow night they're having a conference

22
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:58,573
concerning inheritance of the estate.

23
00:00:58,573 --> 00:01:01,773
Could you please attend it?

24
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:03,773
-"Heizo Hattori" -"According to the client,

25
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:05,373
-"Police Chief of Osaka," -it seems that the actions

26
00:01:05,373 --> 00:01:07,673
-"Heiji's father" -of the owner of the mansion,

27
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:10,073
the inheritee is extremely weird.

28
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:13,373
Therefore, we got a call asking for police personnel

29
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,773
to sit in at the conference.

30
00:01:15,773 --> 00:01:19,273
Oh. Well, I don't mind.

31
00:01:19,273 --> 00:01:20,873
There was a murder

32
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,473
near the forest where that mansion is

33
00:01:23,473 --> 00:01:25,773
and there're weird rumors going around too,

34
00:01:25,773 --> 00:01:29,173
so this is not an order.

35
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:32,973
But, if you're going to attend, be careful

36
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:35,073
not to let them suck your blood.

37
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:37,273
What're they going to suck?

38
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:39,973
You've been mumbling.

39
00:01:39,973 --> 00:01:43,273
I'm not going to be sucked and such for some time now.

40
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:45,173
Heiji?

41
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:49,373
I hope you're not talking about the lips of a woman.

42
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:51,673
Since when were you in the car?

43
00:01:51,673 --> 00:01:53,873
We snuck in when you stopped

44
00:01:53,873 --> 00:01:56,573
at the service station to the restroom.

45
00:01:56,573 --> 00:01:58,073
You didn't realize we were here?

46
00:01:58,073 --> 00:02:01,073
Pops and everyone else is here too.

47
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:06,073
But why?

48
00:02:06,073 --> 00:02:08,673
They want to gaze upon the face of the woman

49
00:02:08,673 --> 00:02:11,073
you're secretly meeting with, Mr. Otaki!

50
00:02:11,073 --> 00:02:15,873
But, we had no idea that you had a woman here.

51
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:17,173
Ran and the others said that

52
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:19,173
they want to introduce her to them too!

53
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:23,373
Well, it's not a woman good enough to show you all.

54
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:26,673
Then will you tell us?

55
00:02:26,673 --> 00:02:28,273
What kind of case is it?

56
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:31,773
It's a case, isn't it?

57
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:35,573
Since you're keeping it from me, I'll bet Dad's involved?

58
00:02:38,873 --> 00:02:40,873
Well, you see, six months ago...

59
00:02:40,873 --> 00:02:42,773
A woman's body was found in the forest

60
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:45,973
near the mansion that we're headed for now.

61
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:47,473
She was found dead ruthlessly

62
00:02:47,473 --> 00:02:51,973
tied upside down on a stake that stood vertically.

63
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:55,173
That's super gross.

64
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:58,573
That woman used to be the maid for that mansion.

65
00:02:58,573 --> 00:03:02,473
But, since the way her body was found was sort of strange.

66
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,673
Sort of strange, how?

67
00:03:04,673 --> 00:03:07,273
The old couple who found the corpse

68
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:09,073
thought at first that it was a scarecrow

69
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:10,573
to keep bears away

70
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:13,973
since the skin of the corpse was so white.

71
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:16,773
That's probably because the culprit cut her artery,

72
00:03:16,773 --> 00:03:19,573
bled her to death, and tied her there.

73
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:21,573
But, there seems to have been no such

74
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:23,973
large wounds anywhere on her body.

75
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:29,373
All they found were two holes on her neck.

76
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:32,173
Two holes in her neck and she bled to death?

77
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:34,873
Hey. Dont tell me that's...

78
00:03:34,873 --> 00:03:35,873
Yeah.

79
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:40,473
Otaki, do you believe they exist in this world?

80
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:42,273
Vampires?

81
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:47,573
Aim for a 100% solution.

82
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:49,973
Clear all mysteries and codes.

83
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:51,773
Dracula exists?

84
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,973
The curtains are raised to a shocking case.

85
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:55,473
He sees through the one and only truth.

86
00:03:55,473 --> 00:03:57,373
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

87
00:03:57,373 --> 00:04:00,173
His name is Detective Conan!

88
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:46,749
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (One)"

89
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:49,582
Vampire?

90
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,782
Are you saying that the murderer was a vampire?

91
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:55,682
It's just a rumor with no grounds.

92
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:57,182
It seems that such a feudal lord

93
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:59,882
used to govern this area in the past, you see.

94
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:01,682
A feudal lord?

95
00:06:01,682 --> 00:06:05,382
And? That murderer hasn't been arrested yet?

96
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:06,482
No.

97
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:09,082
But, I'm sure you at least found a suspect.

98
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:11,482
Yes. The first to be suspected

99
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:14,982
was the owner of the mansion, Mr. Hakuya Torakura.

100
00:06:14,982 --> 00:06:16,982
It seems that the maid who was killed

101
00:06:16,982 --> 00:06:19,482
had confided in the Chef of the mansion.

102
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:21,382
That the owner of the mansion had been acting eerie recently

103
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:25,082
and that she wanted to quit because she felt endangered.

104
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:26,982
Then, it was the owner who did it after all.

105
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:28,482
Oh, no.

106
00:06:28,482 --> 00:06:31,282
He had an alibi.

107
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:35,282
At the estimated time of death of the maid Ms. Shimizu,

108
00:06:35,282 --> 00:06:36,982
the owner's alibi was that

109
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:40,082
he was confined to his room and asleep right through.

110
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:42,882
Ironically, the one who testified to this

111
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:47,982
was the Chef, who Ms. Shimizu had confided in.

112
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:50,482
Thank you for coming.

113
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:53,382
You're Inspector Otaki from the Osaka City Police, aren't you?

114
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:54,782
Yes.

115
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:56,882
So, you must be the one who called?

116
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:58,482
I'm Koga, the butler.

117
00:06:58,482 --> 00:07:02,882
I was a comrades of Chief Hattori's father.

118
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:04,582
What is this about?

119
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:06,282
That the actions of the owner of this mansion's

120
00:07:06,282 --> 00:07:07,982
been eerie recently?

121
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:10,782
Yeah. Recently, the owner

122
00:07:10,782 --> 00:07:12,182
has been avoiding exposure to sunlight

123
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,182
and sleeping all during the day.

124
00:07:15,182 --> 00:07:17,382
He also suddenly started saying that

125
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:19,282
he's become allergic silver and stopped using

126
00:07:19,282 --> 00:07:21,182
the silverware he had been using all this time

127
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:22,982
and disposed of them all.

128
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:25,382
The other day, he cracked the soup dish

129
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:27,582
that had his favorite garlic flavor in it.

130
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:29,782
And said angrily, "Don't ever put garlic inside

131
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,682
because it'll rot my blood!"

132
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:34,182
Hey. It sounds just like...

133
00:07:34,182 --> 00:07:36,682
Yes. It seems to have looked that way

134
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:39,082
to the maid, Ms. Shimizu.

135
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:43,182
He's just like a Dracula, a vampire.

136
00:07:43,182 --> 00:07:45,082
Vampire?

137
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:47,782
Didn't he just say vampire?

138
00:07:47,782 --> 00:07:49,782
What about the vampire?

139
00:07:49,782 --> 00:07:50,982
Oh, no.

140
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:53,082
Bumper, the bumper.

141
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:55,682
We were discussing what to do about the dent

142
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:57,482
we made in the bumper of the rental car!

143
00:07:57,482 --> 00:08:00,182
Oh, the bumper.

144
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:02,982
Hey! Come on in, Heiji and all of you!

145
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,382
It's like a castle and fantastic!

146
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:09,382
It's almost sundown

147
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:12,282
and about time that the owner will be getting up.

148
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:14,582
Please make yourselves at home

149
00:08:14,582 --> 00:08:16,982
until it's time for dinner.

150
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:18,482
Oh, yes.

151
00:08:19,482 --> 00:08:21,082
The talk about the inheritance

152
00:08:21,082 --> 00:08:25,282
of the estate in question will be discussed after dinner.

153
00:08:25,282 --> 00:08:28,082
I wonder if Inspector Otaki's sweetheart

154
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:31,082
is really in this mansion?

155
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:33,982
You mean you still believe that?

156
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,682
This is amazing!

157
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:40,682
I've only ever seen something like this in movies or dramas.

158
00:08:40,682 --> 00:08:42,682
To think I'm actually experiencing it!

159
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:44,282
True.

160
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:46,982
I feel like we've become nobles too.

161
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:48,882
Who are you?

162
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:51,582
-"Ruri Torakura (38), Asanobu's wife" -Don't tell me that

163
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:54,182
you're brother-in-law's love children or something.

164
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:55,982
No way.

165
00:08:57,382 --> 00:09:01,782
If so, he'd never ask us to come over here.

166
00:09:01,782 --> 00:09:04,782
True. If he really had love children,

167
00:09:04,782 --> 00:09:07,682
Hakuya's inheritance wouldn't be given to us, his siblings

168
00:09:07,682 --> 00:09:10,682
but rather, all to his children.

169
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:13,282
But, you never know.

170
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:16,482
He suddenly brought a young beautiful fiance

171
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:19,982
with children here a few years ago, didn't he?

172
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:23,482
It's no surprise if he had two or three love children, right?

173
00:09:23,482 --> 00:09:27,382
Well, although that fiance unfortunately died.

174
00:09:27,382 --> 00:09:28,782
Oh, I get it!

175
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:30,882
For you guys, I guess I should say fortunately?

176
00:09:30,882 --> 00:09:32,482
Hey, you.

177
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:35,682
Watch it!

178
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:37,682
If you ever say something like that again,

179
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:39,382
you're really going to get it!

180
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:41,182
What's with you?

181
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:44,282
I'll bet you thought you were lucky too, didn't you?

182
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:47,182
Oh, don't tell me that

183
00:09:47,182 --> 00:09:50,782
you were really hooked on that lover with children?

184
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:52,782
Why you...

185
00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:55,982
Will you cut out the stuff about his lover?

186
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:59,382
After all, I'm the child of my father's lover too, you know.

187
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:04,082
Well, but if the inheritee only had siblings,

188
00:10:04,082 --> 00:10:06,782
the amount of estate to be received would be the same,

189
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:08,482
so let's stay on peaceful terms.

190
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,582
Excuse me.

191
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:12,682
The Chef told me to ask you

192
00:10:12,682 --> 00:10:14,582
if it's about time that we start serving dinner.

193
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:17,482
Oh, but if you're still not finished talking,

194
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,182
a little while later would do.

195
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:21,682
We can talk over dinner too,

196
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:23,282
so why don't you hurry and start serving?

197
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:26,382
Well, as for a mere love child of that woman,

198
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:28,982
it would be of no concern though.

199
00:10:28,982 --> 00:10:33,182
This is a typical battle over inheritance.

200
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:34,382
I guess so.

201
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:38,382
Huh? An incurable disease?

202
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:41,082
Mr. Hakuya Torakura,

203
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:42,682
the owner of this mansion is afflicted?

204
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:45,582
Yes, that at most, he only had six more months.

205
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:48,682
Oh? Wasn't it three months?

206
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:51,882
That's why we came to this dinner meeting tonight.

207
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:53,482
Well, with something like

208
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:55,082
no inheritance for those who don't attend

209
00:10:55,082 --> 00:10:57,682
written on the invitation card, who wouldn't...

210
00:10:57,682 --> 00:11:00,082
But, what's taking him so long?

211
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:02,382
You're right. At this point, he'd usually

212
00:11:02,382 --> 00:11:04,382
be complaining about the food.

213
00:11:04,382 --> 00:11:06,682
Okay then, girls. I hate to trouble you,

214
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:08,782
but, won't you go and wake him up?

215
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:10,682
-Huh? -Us?

216
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:12,082
Turn right at the corridor

217
00:11:12,082 --> 00:11:14,082
and it's the room at the very end.

218
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:16,682
True. Hakuya may feel much happier

219
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:19,882
if two young girls go to wake him up.

220
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:23,682
The room at the very end would be...

221
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,382
This one, right?

222
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:27,482
But, don't you think it's strange?

223
00:11:27,482 --> 00:11:32,382
Would you normally ask your guests to do something like this?

224
00:11:32,382 --> 00:11:33,682
Huh?

225
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:35,582
There's no bed.

226
00:11:35,582 --> 00:11:37,782
Hey, no way?

227
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:40,882
-A coffin? -I see, I got it!

228
00:11:40,882 --> 00:11:43,682
I thought that when they sent us to wake him up,

229
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:45,782
everybody was sort of grinning.

230
00:11:45,782 --> 00:11:47,582
I'll bet they wanted to frighten us

231
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,282
by making us wake a man who is asleep in the coffin up!

232
00:11:50,282 --> 00:11:53,682
No one should go into something like this before dying.

233
00:12:07,582 --> 00:12:09,682
What is it, what's wrong?

234
00:12:09,682 --> 00:12:12,282
The man's in here.

235
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:16,882
He's just asleep.

236
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:18,782
He sleeps in there recently saying that

237
00:12:18,782 --> 00:12:21,082
he's eventually going in there anyway.

238
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:22,482
He was splattered with blood

239
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,382
with a stake poked into his chest, you know?

240
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:25,982
Splattered with blood?

241
00:12:25,982 --> 00:12:28,282
He's taking his joke a bit too far.

242
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:31,682
It's no joke, he's dead!

243
00:12:31,682 --> 00:12:34,582
What's going on here? It won't open!

244
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:40,482
There's nobody in here!

245
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:41,882
No way?

246
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:43,782
Are you sure he was in here?

247
00:12:43,782 --> 00:12:47,282
Yep. I think he was.

248
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:51,682
You mean he evaporated and vanished?

249
00:12:51,682 --> 00:12:53,982
As if he was some sort of monster...

250
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:01,026
We're not lying!

251
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:03,651
He was really sleeping in here!

252
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:05,251
With blood splattered and a stake

253
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,251
pierced through his chest.

254
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:08,151
He was wearing a black cape.

255
00:13:08,151 --> 00:13:09,151
He had pointy ears

256
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:10,851
and had something that looked like fangs too.

257
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:12,351
As if he were...

258
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:14,951
Count Dracula!

259
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:16,751
He looked like...

260
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:18,551
Count Dracula?

261
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:21,251
Come to think of it, he was called by that nickname

262
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:23,951
when he was a child.

263
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:27,051
Count Dracula because he was Hakuya Torakura.

264
00:13:27,051 --> 00:13:29,551
A nickname that only children would think of.

265
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:31,451
But, that nickname.

266
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:34,851
Maybe it wasn't just a play on words?

267
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:36,651
When you take into consideration

268
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:39,451
-the ancestors of the Torakura family. -True.

269
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,951
In addition, the eerily strange actions of Hakuya

270
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:43,851
in recent years.

271
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:48,251
Maybe he was really possessed

272
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,151
by a vampire.

273
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:53,251
It's a joke, only joke!

274
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:55,351
Hakuya doesn't have pointed ears

275
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:57,351
nor does he have fangs.

276
00:13:57,351 --> 00:14:00,451
If what you saw was Hakuya,

277
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:04,551
he was trying to scare you by dressing up like a monster!

278
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:06,351
I don't know what trick he used to

279
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:08,151
disappear from the coffin though.

280
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:12,051
Well, to vanish just like magic...

281
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,951
you can see stuff like that in the movies etc.

282
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:17,051
It's indeed what a vampire would do.

283
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:18,051
Why you...

284
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:20,051
How dare you talk about Hakuya as if he were a monster!

285
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:23,251
I'll bet I'm not the only one who thinks so.

286
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:24,951
Right, Mr. Butler?

287
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,351
You asked them to come here

288
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:28,551
because you thought so too, right?

289
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:30,351
Yes, sir.

290
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:35,551
Because the owner was acting much too eerie recently.

291
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:38,351
I decided to have these police detectives

292
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:41,851
sit in on the talk about inheritance.

293
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:43,351
Police detectives?

294
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:45,951
I'm Otaki from the Osaka City Police Department.

295
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,951
He is Detective Kogoro Mouri.

296
00:14:48,951 --> 00:14:50,451
-No way. -Don't tell me

297
00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:51,751
he's the Sleeping Kogoro?

298
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:52,851
The one and only!

299
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,951
Excuse me.

300
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:57,251
Your food's getting cold.

301
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:59,251
Would you like me to warm it up again?

302
00:14:59,251 --> 00:15:00,951
Hey, Mr. Otaki.

303
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:03,251
I'm sorry to interrupt you when you're talking but...

304
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:05,151
Can I have you go to a police station nearby

305
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:07,951
and check this red thing out?

306
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:11,251
If it was as Kazuha and Ran saw,

307
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:14,851
this should be Mr. Torakura's blood.

308
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:22,251
Hakuya didn't show up after all.

309
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:23,851
It was written on the invitation card that

310
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:26,351
the talk would take place after dinner and yet...

311
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:28,751
Well, it didn't say that we were going to be having the talk

312
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:30,751
in the dining room either.

313
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:34,051
Hey, Conan. Dad's not around, is he?

314
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:36,551
Pops said he was going to buy cigarettes

315
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:39,351
and left by car with Inspector Otaki.

316
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:43,251
Hey. Why don't we at least finish taking pictures?

317
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,951
What's that about?

318
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:47,051
Every time we have a family gathering like this,

319
00:15:47,051 --> 00:15:49,851
we take pictures together.

320
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:52,551
They've been doing this from three generations before!

321
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,151
But are you going to take pictures

322
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:56,851
without the owner of the mansion?

323
00:15:56,851 --> 00:15:58,551
Yeah. Even last year,

324
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:03,351
Hakuya came bursting into the room saying, "Don't forget me."

325
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:04,851
True.

326
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:07,351
If we all get on with enjoying ourselves,

327
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:10,451
he might just pop in.

328
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:15,951
Mina, pull your chin in a bit.

329
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:16,951
Come on, sis.

330
00:16:16,951 --> 00:16:18,951
Just how long are you going to spend fixing your hair?

331
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:21,151
You're not gonna get any younger no matter how long you mess with it!

332
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:23,051
Shut up.

333
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:24,551
Don't worry.

334
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,651
You're still beautiful, honey.

335
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:28,051
Thank you.

336
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:31,051
Okay, when I go over to that other side,

337
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:33,251
push the shutter, will you?

338
00:16:33,251 --> 00:16:34,851
Oh, okay.

339
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:39,451
Okay, everybody, get ready!

340
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:41,351
-Say! -Cheese.

341
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:48,651
What's the fuss about?

342
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:52,051
Just now, behind everyone...

343
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:55,551
The man who was sleeping a while ago in the coffin!

344
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,651
What? Where is he?

345
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,851
He was here a while ago!

346
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:03,551
In between Johei and Kamiyo.

347
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:06,651
With a pale face like a ghost.

348
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:10,351
Right, right! What I saw was something like that too!

349
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:12,151
Hey, both of you!

350
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:13,951
That's enough.

351
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:16,251
I'll bet you heard of the vampire rumor

352
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:19,051
and came along with the detectives.

353
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:21,651
But stop making a fuss as if you came to

354
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:24,851
some haunted mansion or something!

355
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:26,451
Vampire rumor?

356
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:27,551
What's that about?

357
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,551
Huh? Don't tell me you don't know about it?

358
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,951
Six months ago, in the forest near this mansion,

359
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,451
Ms. Shimizu who used to work as a maid here

360
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:38,851
was found dead.

361
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,951
All the blood from her body was drained

362
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:43,751
and she was tied upside down onto a stake

363
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:46,451
poked into the ground.

364
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:49,351
Moreover, two holes were found on the neck of the corpse,

365
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:51,451
so there was a big fuss over it.

366
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:53,851
That a vampire appeared.

367
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:57,251
At any rate, let's split up and go look for Hakuya!

368
00:17:57,251 --> 00:17:58,951
If we leave things as is,

369
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:01,651
he may really end up being thought of as a monster.

370
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:03,151
Is it true, Heiji?

371
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:05,251
That story about the vampire just now?

372
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,751
Yeah.

373
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:09,951
If we told you, you'd say you want to leave right away.

374
00:18:09,951 --> 00:18:12,951
Then, we'd end up having to leave with you.

375
00:18:12,951 --> 00:18:14,951
That's why we didn't tell you about it.

376
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:17,251
They're gone!

377
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:19,251
Over there.

378
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:21,651
Hey, you! Where're you going?

379
00:18:23,951 --> 00:18:27,051
Huh? You want to eat food with garlic in it?

380
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:29,951
But, you already ate dinner a while ago, didn't you?

381
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:31,951
There was no garlic in the food!

382
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:34,451
If you let us use this kitchen and give us the ingredients,

383
00:18:34,451 --> 00:18:36,851
we'll make it ourselves.

384
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:41,451
But the owner recently says he hates garlic, you see.

385
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:43,351
So, I wonder if there's any garlic around?

386
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:45,051
Oh, we can manage on our own.

387
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:47,251
We'll look for it ourselves.

388
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:50,951
Garlic for vampires?

389
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:53,051
Well, that's the usual.

390
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:56,551
Huh? This refrigerator won't open!

391
00:18:56,551 --> 00:19:00,951
Oh, that's the refrigerator that the owner bought the other day

392
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:03,051
and it's locked.

393
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:04,651
A refrigerator with a lock?

394
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:05,651
Why?

395
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:06,651
Beats me.

396
00:19:06,651 --> 00:19:09,651
I was told that it was to keep good beef

397
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:12,851
to serve to the guests that would coming today.

398
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,751
I didn't get to use it though.

399
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:18,551
Hey.

400
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:20,751
Are you the one, by the way?

401
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:23,351
Who testified during the incident six months ago

402
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:25,851
that the owner had an alibi?

403
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:26,951
Yeah.

404
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:29,051
If I remember correctly, you said that

405
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:31,751
the owner was confined to his room and asleep right through.

406
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:34,651
Yeah. There's no mistake about that!

407
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,051
Because he told me that day that

408
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:38,051
he wanted to check on the taste of the soup

409
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,451
right after he got up, so for me, the chef,

410
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:42,151
to wake him up and bring the soup to him in person.

411
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:45,451
Then, it's not that you were watching over that coffin right through

412
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,551
while the owner was asleep, eh?

413
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:51,851
No, but I'm sure that he never came out of that coffin!

414
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:54,851
He told me before he closed the lid of the coffin.

415
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:57,151
That he felt like somebody's been opening the lid of the coffin

416
00:19:57,151 --> 00:19:59,751
while he's asleep and watching him,

417
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:03,151
so to put something on top of the lid.

418
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:07,151
That's why I place three grains of sesame seed on the lid.

419
00:20:07,151 --> 00:20:08,151
And when I went to wake him,

420
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:11,051
the seeds were in place just like I placed them.

421
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:14,151
That means that the lid of the coffin wasn't opened, isn't it?

422
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:24,251
Which means that this coffin is what's suspicious, but...

423
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:26,251
It doesn't look like there's any hole

424
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:28,251
under tile of the coffin either.

425
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:29,351
No.

426
00:20:30,051 --> 00:20:32,851
But, why was the lid closed?

427
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:36,051
Because the lid closes only up to here.

428
00:20:36,051 --> 00:20:38,851
If anyone saw him splattered with blood,

429
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:41,451
they would panic and let go of the lid.

430
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:47,851
No, the lid wouldn't open when we first tried to open it, right?

431
00:20:47,851 --> 00:20:49,851
Right.

432
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:52,051
Besides, there's something about this room,

433
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,051
a strange something that doesn't feel right.

434
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:58,151
What was that sound?

435
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:00,451
It seems to have sounded from quite a distance away.

436
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:04,051
Hey, take a look at that.

437
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:06,651
The forest is burning.

438
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:09,651
Collapsed?

439
00:21:09,651 --> 00:21:11,751
Are you saying the tunnel collapsed

440
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:13,551
due to an unknown explosion?

441
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:17,451
Yeah. I confirmed by phone a while ago and was told so.

442
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:18,851
No joke?

443
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:21,351
That's the only road that leads up to here, you know.

444
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:24,051
It seems it'll take some time before it's restored.

445
00:21:24,051 --> 00:21:25,251
My God.

446
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:27,951
It's not a problem about having to look for Hakuya anymore.

447
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:30,751
Which means that the owner hasn't been found yet?

448
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:34,251
No. We've all split up and tried looking for him though.

449
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,651
By the way, have you seen my sweetheart?

450
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:40,151
She hasn't been around for a while.

451
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:42,951
Come to think of it, Kishiharu's not around either.

452
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:44,551
As for Kishiharu, he said that

453
00:21:44,551 --> 00:21:47,751
he was going to develop the pictures that we took a while ago

454
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:50,251
after turning his room into a dark room.

455
00:21:50,251 --> 00:21:52,251
It's really unusual that he still uses an analog camera

456
00:21:52,251 --> 00:21:54,051
in this day and age, isn't it?

457
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:57,151
Well, sorry that I'm such an analog person.

458
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:59,051
But thanks to me being that way, I've figured out

459
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,051
the situation that Hakuya's in now.

460
00:22:01,051 --> 00:22:03,751
Huh? You mean you found him?

461
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:06,251
Yeah. He's in the picture.

462
00:22:06,251 --> 00:22:07,951
In the picture?

463
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:11,851
Just as those girls said.

464
00:22:11,851 --> 00:22:14,151
In the room where the picture was taken.

465
00:22:14,151 --> 00:22:16,951
He was right near us.

466
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:21,051
He's turned into a monster who can go through walls.

467
00:23:43,551 --> 00:23:45,551
Why is Hakuya who wasn't here back then,

468
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:47,751
in the center of this picture?

469
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:52,051
I'm sure that Mr. Torakura was in view back then.

470
00:23:52,051 --> 00:23:54,251
Are you saying that the blood that was on the coffin

471
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:56,551
was really blood type AB?

472
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:58,451
Counting those associated with this mansion,

473
00:23:58,451 --> 00:24:00,951
I believe the only one with type AB

474
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:05,051
was the maid Ms. Shimizu, who died half a year ago.

475
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:09,451
Next Conan,

476
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:13,451
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (Two)"

477
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:31,051
Next Conan's Hint:

478
00:24:31,051 --> 00:24:33,351
"Garlic"

479
00:24:33,451 --> 00:24:34,751
Hattori, what're you looking for?

480
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:36,651
Garlic, a cross and a silver spoon.

481
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:38,151
Hey, calm down!
