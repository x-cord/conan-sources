1
00:00:01,313 --> 00:00:04,513
We came to a rehearsal for a live of Rokumichi Hado,

2
00:00:04,513 --> 00:00:06,413
who was going to release a song called "ASACA",

3
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:10,213
that he made 17 years ago as a new song.

4
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:11,313
But...

5
00:00:59,513 --> 00:01:01,513
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

6
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:03,913
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

7
00:01:03,913 --> 00:01:05,713
In the shadow of the case happening on stage

8
00:01:05,713 --> 00:01:07,913
lurk Amuro, Okiya and Vermouth!

9
00:01:07,913 --> 00:01:09,713
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:12,013
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

11
00:01:12,013 --> 00:01:14,313
His name is Detective Conan!

12
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:48,446
"The Traitor's Stage (Part 2)"

13
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,901
What?

14
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:53,601
The words written on the paper were written by the victim?

15
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:54,901
Yes, sir.

16
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:56,701
According to forensics,

17
00:02:56,701 --> 00:03:01,101
the paper was from a note pad that the victim used to write lyrics.

18
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:02,601
The handwriting matched that of the other songs

19
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:05,501
that were written on that memo pad.

20
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:09,501
So he felt indebted to someone,

21
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:13,301
and it is very likely that it became the reason why he was murdered.

22
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:15,101
Do you have any idea what it could be?

23
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:17,001
I don't know if he felt indebted,

24
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:18,401
but if it was about feeling inferior.

25
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:21,001
He used to grieve saying that he didn't look very approachable

26
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,701
so he had trouble closing the gap

27
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:26,901
between himself and the other good looking musicians.

28
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:28,001
I see.

29
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:31,601
Well, I used to tell him not to worry about it, though.

30
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:35,901
That his unfriendly looks was one of his attractive points, too.

31
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:39,401
Come to think of it, Mr. Hado's image changed recently, right?

32
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:42,601
Yeah, he seems softer than before.

33
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:44,701
Changed like how?

34
00:03:44,701 --> 00:03:46,701
His impression, sort of.

35
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:48,301
His face, maybe?

36
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:49,601
Come to think of it,

37
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:52,701
there were rumors going around that Hado had plastic surgery.

38
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:57,301
But that was back when Hado graduated from high school, I think?

39
00:03:57,301 --> 00:04:00,601
Like I told you before, that's all baloney.

40
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:02,901
Because back then, both he and I had no money

41
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:06,901
and we were desperately part-timing at a courier company to raise money

42
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:10,401
so that he could continue his musical career!

43
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:13,901
But Hado had the nerve to dump you who went through hard times with him

44
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:17,001
and marry another woman.

45
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:19,701
If I remember correctly, he got married 16 years ago.

46
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:23,901
And the song, "ASACA" that was supposed to be released this time

47
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:25,301
was made17 years ago.

48
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:29,001
Isn't there a reason why he left that song as is

49
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:31,201
without even writing the lyrics for it for 17 years?

50
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:34,301
Right, Ms. Beautiful?

51
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:37,201
Hey, you! Cut it out already!

52
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:40,501
President, you know something too, don't you?

53
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:44,801
At the previous live, I heard that you and Hado really had it out.

54
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:45,901
You bawled him out saying

55
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:48,301
why he didn't say anything about the song for 17 years.

56
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:51,601
Then after that fight, Hado suddenly announced

57
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:54,401
that he would be releasing the new song "ASACA".

58
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:58,001
I just know there's got to be something behind this.

59
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:00,101
Is that true?

60
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:06,301
No. He joined out record company 17 years ago.

61
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:09,601
I told him jokingly that the real reason I helped him debut

62
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:16,901
was because I fell in love at first sight with Ms. Enjo.

63
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,901
He said if that's true, he was going to resign.

64
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,201
I see.

65
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:23,901
But that doesn't sound enoug to be a motive

66
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:25,601
for killing Mr. Hado, does it?

67
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,701
I guess I'll get already then.

68
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:29,801
Wait!

69
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:32,101
This is an impossible crime

70
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:34,901
that no one can commit in the first place, isn't it?

71
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,701
Can't do. It's impossible.

72
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:43,001
You're finished.

73
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,301
Scotch.

74
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:04,401
Back then, his right hand was smeared with blood

75
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,001
and yet, there was no blood on the tip of his thumb

76
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:07,901
and on the back of his hand.

77
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:12,601
Which means that he put his own thumb onto the trigger

78
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:15,301
and shot himself.

79
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:18,001
He gave his own gun to him.

80
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:21,301
The one who made him do so was...

81
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:24,801
Shuichi Akai.

82
00:06:26,101 --> 00:06:28,101
Being who he is,

83
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:30,301
he would've been able to make Scotch choose a lot of other ways

84
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:32,301
other than having to kill himself.

85
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:37,901
Hey.

86
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:41,701
That guy's been glaring this way for some time, do you know why?

87
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:42,701
No.

88
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:44,301
Before anything else,

89
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:46,401
can you please hurry and do something about this?

90
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:50,001
Because it's dangerous to stay here in disguise for a long time.

91
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:51,101
I know.

92
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:53,101
Hey! Let me go!

93
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:57,001
I've got to go back quickly and write an article about this case!

94
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:00,601
Before that, let me confirm the contents of your bag.

95
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:01,801
You sure are persistent.

96
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:04,001
Let me go, I said!

97
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:10,301
Ouch...

98
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:13,501
The evidence!

99
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,601
I'll help you pick it up.

100
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,401
Thank you.

101
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:24,401
This is Mr. Hado's driver license.

102
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:27,301
It's true that he's emitting an unfriendly aura.

103
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:38,701
Looking at the pictures that were inside the camera in your bag,

104
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:41,801
you were secretly taking pictures of Mr. Hado who went into the hall,

105
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:45,801
but he found you and almost took your camera away from you.

106
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:47,801
Is that what happened?

107
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,901
Yeah.

108
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,101
What did he say back then?

109
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:53,601
He just told me not to take pictures without permission.

110
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:56,401
And besides that, Inspector,

111
00:07:56,401 --> 00:08:01,301
a back band member who was supposed to perform with Mr. Hado

112
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:04,001
in tomorrow's live was just picked up by the narcs.

113
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:05,101
What?

114
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:08,301
He was arrested red-handed for possession of illegal drugs.

115
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:11,401
Wait, forensics officer.

116
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:12,701
What is it, sonny?

117
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,201
You know what...

118
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:16,901
Did you find... on the ground?

119
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:20,801
It seems that Azusa dropped only one side.

120
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,201
Only one side...

121
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:24,801
Dropped?

122
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:35,801
No, nothing like that was found on stage.

123
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:37,601
Then, was anything missing?

124
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,101
Like wire or work gloves.

125
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:44,501
Yeah. It seems that those two things were missing from the tool box

126
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:46,801
that the staff put on the sleeve of the stage.

127
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:49,601
Then, did the staff also bring the folding pipe chair

128
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:52,501
that was beside the tool box and put it there?

129
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:56,001
It seems to have been way inside, but...

130
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:58,701
Hey, they said to leave the equipment as is

131
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:00,601
because the live is canceled.

132
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:01,901
Seriously?

133
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:04,301
I opened everything and now I have to put everything back again.

134
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:07,701
You checked that folding pipe chair too, didn't you?

135
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:09,701
No, not yet for fingerprints.

136
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:11,701
We were going to take it back with us and check it.

137
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:14,601
The other forensic officer is taking it along together with the mic stand.

138
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:15,701
Excuse me,

139
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:18,301
but could I have a look at the underside of the seat?

140
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:20,501
What? Okay, please be quick about it.

141
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:22,401
Thank you.

142
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,001
Just as I thought.

143
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,301
So, that's the story.

144
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:34,201
Things look pretty bad.

145
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:35,601
Yes.

146
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:37,301
Excuse me, I'm coming through.

147
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:39,801
Excuse me. Please let me through.

148
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:42,901
Excuse me. Please let me through.

149
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:46,001
Excuse me. Please let me through.

150
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:49,901
That's right. I remember back then,

151
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:53,301
a mysterious lady tried to kidnap Conan and Ai...

152
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:57,701
Come on and move away from that brunette.

153
00:09:57,701 --> 00:09:59,801
If you don't want to die, quickly!

154
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:01,701
Come on, quickly!

155
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,701
Move it, Angel!

156
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:07,701
She called me that.

157
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:13,301
But why did Azusa call me the same way that lady did?

158
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:19,206
You figured it out?

159
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:22,306
The trick that the perp used to hang Mr. Hado up?

160
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:23,606
Are you serious?

161
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:25,406
Yes, I think so.

162
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:29,506
So, we passed the rope through the spotlight bar,

163
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:31,506
then tied one side of the rope

164
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:35,206
onto Officer Takagi who is sitting in the chair.

165
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:36,706
But, are you sure that it will take just one person

166
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:38,406
to suspend him in mid air?

167
00:10:38,406 --> 00:10:40,006
Of course.

168
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,906
First, you create a loop with the rope

169
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:43,806
hanging from the bar on the stage

170
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:46,406
and make a knot like this.

171
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:47,906
Then pass the rope below from the foreground under the rope at the top

172
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:51,106
and wrap the bottom loop around the top loop two times.

173
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:54,406
Twist the loop on the bottom as you pull it through the loop.

174
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:59,106
Pass the section hanging down through the loop.

175
00:10:59,106 --> 00:11:00,906
Hook the resulting large loop

176
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:04,806
onto the armrest of the seat about two meter below.

177
00:11:04,806 --> 00:11:06,606
Like this.

178
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:09,206
Next, pass the end of the rope

179
00:11:09,206 --> 00:11:11,906
without the loops under the armrest.

180
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:14,206
Create the same loops as before and pass the rope through.

181
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,806
Now, hook the large loop and rope

182
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:20,106
on the armrest of a chair about four meters away.

183
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:23,906
Create the third look and pass the rope through,

184
00:11:23,906 --> 00:11:29,006
and this time, hook the large loop onto a chair

185
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:31,006
about eight meters away.

186
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:32,406
Now, all you have to do is

187
00:11:32,406 --> 00:11:37,906
return to the third set of small loops you created

188
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,306
and pull on the leftover rope.

189
00:11:40,306 --> 00:11:42,406
Sonoko, since you look to be the weakest,

190
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:43,906
will you pull the rope, please?

191
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:47,406
Who, me?

192
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,206
Okay.

193
00:11:50,606 --> 00:11:53,506
I don't think I'll be able to lift him up, though.

194
00:11:58,506 --> 00:11:59,906
What the?

195
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:01,806
What's going on?

196
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:04,806
Principle of the pulley. Correct?

197
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:06,206
Yes.

198
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:07,306
The small loop that was made partway

199
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:10,506
through the rope functioned as a pulley.

200
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:12,006
Each loop makes it possible for the rope

201
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:16,606
to be pulled at two times, four times, or eight times the power.

202
00:12:16,606 --> 00:12:19,606
It's actually not a pulley but the loop of a rope,

203
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,306
so due to friction 8 times is not possible,

204
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:24,506
but if a light and slippery rope is used,

205
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:27,906
even Sonoko can lift Officer Takagi up.

206
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:31,206
This means that not many,

207
00:12:31,206 --> 00:12:34,706
but just one person lifted Mr. Hado up.

208
00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:39,606
This is the way that couriers tie their rope

209
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:42,106
and fix their loads on securely.

210
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:45,006
In other words, the one most suspicious of being the perp

211
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:47,506
that lifted Mr. Hado up is

212
00:12:47,506 --> 00:12:50,906
the one who used to work at a courier company in her younger days...

213
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:53,106
Mr. Hado's manager.

214
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:58,706
You, Ms. Kanae Enjo.

215
00:12:58,706 --> 00:13:00,506
Okay, maybe she lifted him up,

216
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:03,306
but how did she tie the rope onto the seats?

217
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:06,106
That's easy.

218
00:13:06,106 --> 00:13:08,506
After lifting him up,

219
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:10,206
she ties the tip of the rope to a seat nearby temporarily

220
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,206
and sets it in place.

221
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:14,606
She twists a wire into this part of the rope

222
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:17,606
that's hanging from above.

223
00:13:17,606 --> 00:13:18,706
If she fixes the rope

224
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:21,306
that is hanging from the ceiling in place with the wire,

225
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:23,306
next all she has to do is untie the extra rope

226
00:13:23,306 --> 00:13:26,806
and tie it on again to the seat, then remove the wire.

227
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,006
The good thing about this courier tying method is

228
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:32,706
no knot is tied anywhere so it's easy to untie.

229
00:13:32,706 --> 00:13:34,306
But if a new rope were used,

230
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:37,206
marks would be left behind on the rope.

231
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:40,706
That's why after she retied the rope to the seat,

232
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:42,706
she cut off the extra rope with a cutter

233
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:44,106
that was in the tool box and coiled the rope.

234
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,006
She then put it next to the tool box

235
00:13:46,006 --> 00:13:50,006
that was at the sleeve of the stage, correct?

236
00:13:50,006 --> 00:13:52,006
Ms. Enjo?

237
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:56,006
Hey, hey. Just because she part-timed at a courier before,

238
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:59,506
to accuse her of being the perp just because of that is...

239
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,006
It's the size of her feet.

240
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:06,406
-Feet? -Couriers coil the rope around like this

241
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:10,006
and bundle the rope.

242
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:12,206
The inside loop of the rope that is coiled

243
00:14:12,206 --> 00:14:13,606
is approximately the same size

244
00:14:13,606 --> 00:14:15,506
as the feet of the person who coiled the rope!

245
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:17,506
The length from the elbow to the wrist

246
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:20,006
is the size of that person's feet.

247
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:21,506
The loop of the rope at the scene

248
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:25,406
was coiled in just about the size of Ran's feet

249
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,506
so I just thought that the rope might have been

250
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:30,806
tied by the manager who is of small built.

251
00:14:30,806 --> 00:14:32,506
I see.

252
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:35,506
The feelings that the Ms. Beauty felt for Hado

253
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:39,206
turned into a grudge over a span of 17 years.

254
00:14:39,206 --> 00:14:41,706
Hey! Stop making rude remarks!

255
00:14:41,706 --> 00:14:44,206
We don't know if she's the one who did it.

256
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:47,006
Contact lenses.

257
00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:49,606
I'm sure you must've noticed because you're his manager,

258
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:51,706
that Mr. Hado was wearing circle contact lens

259
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:53,606
to make his iris look bigger.

260
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:54,906
Yes.

261
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:57,106
When I compared Mr. Hado's driver's license picture

262
00:14:57,106 --> 00:15:00,306
to the picture that the magazine reporter took of Mr. Hado today,

263
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:02,406
even I could tell.

264
00:15:03,506 --> 00:15:05,906
One of the lens

265
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,406
is stuck to your back, Manager.

266
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:09,806
What?

267
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:15,306
This is...

268
00:15:15,306 --> 00:15:17,006
May I?

269
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:18,806
Yes.

270
00:15:18,806 --> 00:15:20,406
I see.

271
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:23,106
When you lifted him up,

272
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:25,906
it unfortunately probably dropped onto your clothes.

273
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:27,906
We've got enough evidence.

274
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:29,506
We'll hear the rest out at the station.

275
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:32,006
Wait. Did you really do it?

276
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:36,406
Why did you have to kill the man that you supported for 17 years?

277
00:15:36,406 --> 00:15:38,706
Please answer me.

278
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:40,106
She wouldn't be able to answer that question

279
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,006
no matter how much you ask.

280
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:45,806
Because she didn't kill him.

281
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:47,806
What?

282
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:49,706
Just what are you talking about?

283
00:15:49,706 --> 00:15:54,306
Where do you think the other circle lens was?

284
00:15:54,306 --> 00:15:56,706
It was stuck on the back of the seat of the folding pipe chair

285
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,106
that was left at the sleeve of the stage.

286
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:01,306
In other words, the chair was on the floor

287
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:04,306
right below where he was hung at his feet.

288
00:16:04,306 --> 00:16:09,006
Furthermore, the baseball with the kite string tied onto it.

289
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:13,506
The other tip of the kite string was tied onto the tip of the rope.

290
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,406
Then the ball was thrown to pass the kite string

291
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:16,706
through the bar on the ceiling,

292
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:18,406
so that by pulling the kite string,

293
00:16:18,406 --> 00:16:21,706
the rope would be passed over the bar.

294
00:16:21,706 --> 00:16:22,806
No offense,

295
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:27,706
but I don't think Ms. Enjo can throw the ball high enough over the bar.

296
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:29,706
If it were Mr. Hado, who played baseball during his high school days

297
00:16:29,706 --> 00:16:31,906
and had a powerful shoulder, it's a different story, though.

298
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:34,506
"I'm sorry" -And the memo that was found

299
00:16:34,506 --> 00:16:37,306
in Mr. Hado's chest pocket written in his own handwriting.

300
00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:39,306
You know what I'm getting at, don't you?

301
00:16:39,306 --> 00:16:41,606
Don't tell me that he took...

302
00:16:41,606 --> 00:16:44,806
Right. He hung himself.

303
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:46,406
She found him

304
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,106
and tried to make it look as if he was murdered.

305
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:51,506
Hey, why did you hide the suicide?

306
00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:54,806
So, something did happen 17 years ago, right?

307
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,306
Don't tell me that he got all chewed up

308
00:16:57,306 --> 00:16:59,106
about what I told him the other day?

309
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:00,606
What did you tell him?

310
00:17:00,606 --> 00:17:03,106
Actually, 17 years ago,

311
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,406
she was pregnant with Hado's child.

312
00:17:05,406 --> 00:17:07,106
Mr. Fuse!

313
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:09,706
Saying that it was for the sake of his child who was going to be born,

314
00:17:09,706 --> 00:17:11,906
Hado, who just debuted confined himself in the studio

315
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,406
and continued composing songs,

316
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:15,606
to the point where it looked as if he would die

317
00:17:15,606 --> 00:17:18,006
from consecutively staying up all night.

318
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:19,506
So, she went to ask him to stop,

319
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:23,606
but collapsed on the floor in front of the studio and miscarried.

320
00:17:23,606 --> 00:17:26,706
Then, at the hospital,

321
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:30,006
she told me not to tell Hado what happened.

322
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:32,906
I see. The title of the song back then

323
00:17:32,906 --> 00:17:35,706
that he made for the unborn child was "ASACA",

324
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:37,006
but no lyrics were made for that song

325
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:39,806
and it was shelved for 17 years.

326
00:17:39,806 --> 00:17:42,506
After finding out what happened, he felt responsible for what happened,

327
00:17:42,506 --> 00:17:45,906
decides to write lyrics for it and release the song.

328
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:48,306
However, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't write,

329
00:17:48,306 --> 00:17:52,906
so he wrote a message "I'm sorry" and chose to die.

330
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:57,306
But, why did you need to make it look like a murder?

331
00:17:57,306 --> 00:18:01,206
I didn't want his family to find out that he committed suicide

332
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:04,706
because of his ex-girl's unborn child.

333
00:18:04,706 --> 00:18:09,206
That's why I took his cell phone that was in his pocket

334
00:18:09,206 --> 00:18:12,806
that had the call history of his mail that said, "Bye".

335
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:16,606
I wanted him to soar high to the heavens.

336
00:18:21,106 --> 00:18:24,606
He's dead and yet he makes women cry. What an idiot.

337
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:29,506
Please don't write an article on this!

338
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:32,606
I pursued Hado for so many years, you know.

339
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:36,406
Day after day, I crawled over the ground looking for an article.

340
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,606
And the great scoop that I finally get hold of

341
00:18:38,606 --> 00:18:40,706
turns out to be Hado's greatest scandal of his life.

342
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:43,606
Please don't! Please!

343
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:47,406
I think I know Hado better than anyone else.

344
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:49,606
I wouldn't write about him even if you asked me to.

345
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:55,106
Sentimental stories don't jive with rock and rollers.

346
00:18:57,706 --> 00:19:00,606
But everything's still a mystery.

347
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:04,006
I wonder why the "CA" of "ASACA" was written with "C" instead of a "K"?

348
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:07,006
I've asked Hado about it before.

349
00:19:07,006 --> 00:19:08,606
He heard about the pregnancy

350
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,206
at a morning cafe after he stayed up all night,

351
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:12,206
so he said if it's a girl, it'd be written "Asaca" in Chinese characters

352
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:15,106
or if in alphabet, it would be spelled "ASACA"

353
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:16,906
after the word morning cafe.

354
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,106
I see! I'm convinced!

355
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:21,406
But despite you being a super close friend to him,

356
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:23,106
so close that he would tell you all this,

357
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:26,806
how is it that you turn your back on him and push him into resigning?

358
00:19:26,806 --> 00:19:29,506
Maybe you knew about the guy in his back band

359
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:32,506
that was nabbed by the narcs a while ago?

360
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:36,506
I... I don't know anything about that.

361
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:39,406
My, you sure have quick ears.

362
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:43,406
No, no. The news is already on the internet.

363
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:46,406
He's really something.

364
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:48,806
You're really something, Scotch.

365
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:50,906
To pretend that you were knocked down by me

366
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:53,206
and during that time you pulled my gun out.

367
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:55,806
I don't mean to ask you to spare me,

368
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:59,306
but won't you hear me out before you shoot me?

369
00:19:59,306 --> 00:20:03,306
I didn't take your gun to shoot you.

370
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:04,706
I see.

371
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:13,106
But to do this!

372
00:20:13,106 --> 00:20:14,306
Impossible.

373
00:20:16,906 --> 00:20:21,206
It's humanly impossible to pull the trigger

374
00:20:21,206 --> 00:20:25,206
when you're holding the cylinder of the revolver.

375
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:27,906
Forget about killing yourself.

376
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:30,406
You're not meant to die here.

377
00:20:30,406 --> 00:20:31,706
What?

378
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:35,506
I'm Shuichi Akai who have infiltrated here from the FBI.

379
00:20:35,506 --> 00:20:39,706
I'm a dog just like you who wants to sink my teeth into them.

380
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:44,506
So now that you know, let go of the gun and hear me out.

381
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:48,906
It's no problem letting you get away.

382
00:20:48,906 --> 00:20:50,406
Okay.

383
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:04,906
I see.

384
00:21:04,906 --> 00:21:09,006
He fired the gun to break this.

385
00:21:09,006 --> 00:21:14,006
This cell phone that would have had the data of his family and friends.

386
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:24,406
Traitor's shall be punished.

387
00:21:24,406 --> 00:21:26,106
Right?

388
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:30,606
That high neck of yours.

389
00:21:30,606 --> 00:21:34,706
I'm overtaken by the impulse of wanting to pull it down right here.

390
00:21:34,706 --> 00:21:38,006
But I guess I won't do it now.

391
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,606
One day...

392
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:43,406
I will.

393
00:23:09,206 --> 00:23:11,706
Azusa!

394
00:23:11,706 --> 00:23:13,306
What?

395
00:23:13,306 --> 00:23:18,006
Rather, you aren't Azusa, are you?

396
00:23:18,006 --> 00:23:20,006
Most probably I'm sure...

397
00:23:20,006 --> 00:23:23,206
you're the one who called me angel.

398
00:23:23,206 --> 00:23:25,206
I've told you before, Ran.

399
00:23:25,206 --> 00:23:28,306
Don't get any closer than you are now.

400
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:33,506
Because you are my treasure.

401
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:36,506
Right,

402
00:23:36,506 --> 00:23:42,106
the only two treasures I have in this world.

403
00:23:42,606 --> 00:23:43,806
"Next Episode"

404
00:23:43,806 --> 00:23:47,206
-Awesome! -It's really spectacular!

405
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:49,606
Where are you going to put all these books?

406
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:53,606
This shop is bursting with books that won't sell!

407
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:56,606
Meeting an antique book is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, you know.

408
00:23:56,606 --> 00:23:57,906
I'm sure that they will someday

409
00:23:57,906 --> 00:24:01,806
fall into the hands of people that are looking for them.

410
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:03,406
This is...

411
00:24:07,306 --> 00:24:12,606
Next Conan, "The Whistling Used Book Shop"
