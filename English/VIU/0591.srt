1
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:02,983
What exactly does that mean?

2
00:00:02,983 --> 00:00:06,783
"Sunday" -To have constructed an aquarium in the house?

3
00:00:06,783 --> 00:00:10,583
Mr. Nishida is a famous aquarium designer

4
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:14,083
so maybe he has a huge fish tank in his house.

5
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,283
Aku... akurimu?

6
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:19,083
Then, does that mean it's a new type of ice cream?

7
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:22,883
It's "a-ku-a-ri-u-mu". It means aquarium.

8
00:00:22,883 --> 00:00:26,283
An architect who designs aquariums.

9
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,583
The house of a person who makes aquariums?

10
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,283
I wonder what the house will be like!

11
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,783
I'm nervous!

12
00:00:52,683 --> 00:00:54,583
Brooding over passing seasons

13
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,383
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

14
00:00:56,383 --> 00:00:58,083
Even the fish are freaked out

15
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,183
in the house with an aquarium.

16
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:01,883
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:03,883
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:01:03,883 --> 00:01:06,083
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:32,521
"The House with an Aquarium".

20
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:40,321
"Nishida, Aquarium Design Office"

21
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:42,329
Maybe he isn't home?

22
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,029
That's strange.

23
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:47,529
We definitely agreed on 12:00.

24
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,929
Dr. Agasa?

25
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:55,229
Mr. Imura.

26
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:56,829
"Kousuke Imura (32), Nishida's Assistant" -It's been a while.

27
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:00,829
Oh, is Nishida not in?

28
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:06,129
He promised to show me the interior of his house today.

29
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:08,729
So that's why the kids are here too?

30
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:09,829
Good afternoon.

31
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:12,529
I'm Nishida's assistant, Imura.

32
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:14,629
Hello...

33
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:19,229
Nishida probably went out to buy something.

34
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:21,729
Here, I'll get us in with the spare key.

35
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:26,429
Here, come in.

36
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:28,729
Thank you, Mr. Imura.

37
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:30,429
By the way, your clothes...

38
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:32,729
Did you come back from a trip somewhere?

39
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:34,829
I went to tour Guam.

40
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:37,029
I left there last night.

41
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:40,129
I arrived in Narita just this morning.

42
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:42,029
I'm a little behind on sleep.

43
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:56,529
Awesome.

44
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:04,729
This is fantastic!

45
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:06,729
A pirate ship!

46
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:12,529
This fish has a pointy mouth!

47
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:15,529
That's the Caribbean Longsnout,

48
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:18,329
it's part of the family of butterflyfish who lives in the Caribbean Sea.

49
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,429
Caribbean Sea?

50
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,029
What's this?

51
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:27,029
There's a fish with weird markings on it.

52
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:30,029
That's a species of pufferfish that live in the Indian Ocean.

53
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:33,929
I wonder if there are Indian eels.

54
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:36,429
So pretty!

55
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:43,529
There are really rare! Black clownfish!

56
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:46,029
Those are from Australia.

57
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:51,029
Look at that, Ai. All the pretty fish!

58
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:54,029
Yeah, just like jewels.

59
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:56,429
You're romantic for a change.

60
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,829
I wonder how much electric bill per month is spent

61
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:01,329
on just the aquariums.

62
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:03,329
They're certainly living jewels, aren't they?

63
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:04,729
Come on.

64
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:08,629
Hey, there isn't anything in that tank.

65
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:09,929
Oh, no!

66
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:15,329
Genta, what happened?

67
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:17,529
The roof came off!

68
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:19,129
Give me a break.

69
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:49,529
This glue doesn't dry easily,

70
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,629
so don't touch the miniature.

71
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:53,029
All right.

72
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:55,029
That's right!

73
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:01,429
Chocolates from Guam, anyone?

74
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:03,829
Gum chocolate? What's that?

75
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:05,529
It's Guam, Gu-a-m.

76
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:07,429
Me, I want some!

77
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:09,829
Before that, wash your hands.

78
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:11,429
Yes...

79
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:15,029
This is spacious!

80
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:16,929
How nice.

81
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:24,729
What was that?

82
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:28,029
Hey, what happened?

83
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:30,129
Conan...

84
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,729
Ni... Nishida?

85
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,429
Master!

86
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,529
No... no way!

87
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:42,829
Are you two all right?

88
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:44,129
Yes.

89
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:47,229
Mr. Imura, hurry, call an ambulance!

90
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:48,229
Yes.

91
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:52,729
It's regrettable,

92
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:54,529
but he's already gone.

93
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:56,229
It's best to call the police as well.

94
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:58,229
What?

95
00:06:58,229 --> 00:06:59,629
This person

96
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:02,629
has a mark like an insect bite on the nape of his neck.

97
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:04,429
What exactly...

98
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:08,729
What's that?

99
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:13,529
You can't stay here.

100
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:15,029
Just a little...

101
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,929
Come, let's go.

102
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:21,229
No! Just a second!

103
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:26,929
In short, at 12:30 pm today,

104
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,529
you discovered Nishida's body

105
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:31,129
submerged in the bathtub, right?

106
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:33,229
That's correct.

107
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:34,829
What's the condition of the body?

108
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,329
There are no conspicuous external wounds,

109
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:39,429
and the cause of death is drowning.

110
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:41,729
Judging from the extent of the rigor mortis,

111
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:46,529
Mr. Nishida most likely passed away Friday night.

112
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:49,829
With today being Sunday,

113
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:51,829
that gives us two days.

114
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:56,629
There's a bottle brandy and a glass on the work desk.

115
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:59,729
He took a bath after drinking?

116
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,529
As he was drunk,

117
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:03,929
he probably fell asleep while bathing

118
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:06,029
and drowned.

119
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:07,429
I suppose so.

120
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:09,529
Mr. Nishida is a strange person, isn't he?

121
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:11,229
What?

122
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:14,929
Well, Mr. Nishida took bath at night, didn't he?

123
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:16,629
But he didn't even turn on the light

124
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,929
and bathed in complete darkness.

125
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:21,429
You are right.

126
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:24,029
If he took a bath on Friday night,

127
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:26,129
the light should have been on, but...

128
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:27,329
Hold on!

129
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:30,129
Say, don't you think this is strange too?

130
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:33,529
That's glue on his fingertip, isn't it?

131
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:37,429
It looks that way.

132
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,629
Wait! Conan!

133
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:44,429
Applying glue onto miniatures,

134
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:46,229
is a very delicate task

135
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:48,529
that requires using needles of a syringe.

136
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,629
It's amazing that Mr. Nishida had complete control of his hands.

137
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,129
Normally, when one is drunk,

138
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:58,129
it would be impossible to do something this demanding.

139
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:01,429
We should have forensics determine

140
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:05,429
exactly how drunk Mr. Nishida was when he died.

141
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:07,129
Yes, sir!

142
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,929
Could you conduct the test to determine

143
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:10,529
the level of alcohol content in his blood first?

144
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:11,829
Roger, sir!

145
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:16,529
Also, confirm Mr. Imura's alibi since he has a spare key.

146
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:17,629
Understood.

147
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:22,029
My apologies,

148
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:26,529
but could you tell us where you were Friday night?

149
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:29,029
Isn't it an accident?

150
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:31,329
This is merely a formality.

151
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:36,529
I was on an overseas trip to Guam on Friday night.

152
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:40,629
I was shooting on both Friday and Saturday night, so...

153
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:43,329
The shooting range should have a record of it.

154
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:46,729
Incidentally, when did this trip start and end?

155
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:49,029
I left on Thursday night

156
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:51,829
and returned to Narita this morning.

157
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:57,129
I believe you can confirm that with my passport.

158
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:01,329
-Here it is. -Excuse me.

159
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:08,229
I see you left Guam on Saturday night.

160
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:10,029
Thank you for your cooperation.

161
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:11,529
You're not supposed to touch!

162
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:15,129
I thought it should be dry by now.

163
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:17,629
Geez, Genta.

164
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:21,829
Hey, hey. He said the glue didn't dry easily, didn't he?

165
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,829
I wonder how long it'll take to dry.

166
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:29,829
Well, this is a special type that can dry in water,

167
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,829
so it'd probably take about 12 hours or so to completely dry.

168
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:35,429
12 hours?

169
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:40,829
The glue on the body's fingertips wasn't dry yet.

170
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:44,929
If Mr. Nishida died on Friday night,

171
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:48,429
it is strange that the glue hasn't dried.

172
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:50,529
Conan, this is bad!

173
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:52,429
What is it, Ayumi?

174
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:54,229
All the shrimps are dead.

175
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:55,429
What?

176
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:58,829
I thought they weren't keeping anything in this tank.

177
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:04,829
The shrimps are there to control the water quality.

178
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,729
I wonder why they're dead.

179
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:11,429
The shrimps here are a different species from the ones over there.

180
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:14,229
The lower part of their legs is white.

181
00:11:14,229 --> 00:11:18,029
The water quality and environment of every tank seems to be different

182
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:20,729
so the species are probably placed in them accordingly.

183
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:30,229
Could it be...

184
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:32,729
Ayumi!

185
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:35,429
There are live baby jellyfish!

186
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,629
It's true! Baby jellyfish!

187
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:39,829
Jellyfish?

188
00:11:55,729 --> 00:11:58,329
I see, so that's how it was.

189
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:02,029
This wasn't an accident,

190
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:04,629
but an ingeniously planned murder!

191
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,927
Inspector.

192
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:12,727
The blood test report is in.

193
00:12:12,727 --> 00:12:18,127
The alcohol content in Mr. Nishida's blood was 0.40%.

194
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:21,027
0.40%?

195
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:25,327
Usually, that's the state bordering unconsciousness.

196
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:30,227
The fingerprints found on the glass matched Mr. Nishida's.

197
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:32,227
With this, we can conclude that we were right.

198
00:12:32,227 --> 00:12:36,527
Mr. Nishida went to bathe even after he became drunk

199
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:38,427
and eventually drowned.

200
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:40,727
An accident due to carelessness.

201
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,027
I suppose so.

202
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:47,127
That's why I advised him not to drink so much.

203
00:12:47,127 --> 00:12:48,627
Hold on!

204
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:54,227
Mr. Nishida didn't drink any alcohol before he died.

205
00:12:54,227 --> 00:12:55,827
-What? -What?

206
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:58,027
On the nape of Mr. Nishida's neck,

207
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,427
there's a small spot that resembles an insect bite, isn't there?

208
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:04,827
That's the mark left behind from an injection.

209
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,627
First, the culprit,

210
00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:10,927
snuck up on Mr. Nishida, who was working on the miniature.

211
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:14,727
He used chemicals to put Mr. Nishida to sleep.

212
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:19,227
Afterwards, he used the syringe,

213
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:22,727
and injected the alcohol directly into his blood-stream

214
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:24,827
through the nape of Mr. Nishida's neck.

215
00:13:25,827 --> 00:13:30,027
In this way, alcohol would be detected in the body's blood,

216
00:13:30,027 --> 00:13:34,027
and it would look as if Mr. Nishida was wasted from alcohol and died.

217
00:13:35,227 --> 00:13:37,927
Afterwards, the culprit submerged the unconscious Mr. Nishida

218
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:41,327
in the bathtub and drowned him.

219
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:44,627
Isn't that so?

220
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:45,727
Mr. Imura!

221
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,627
What about me?

222
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:51,327
Confess.

223
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:56,327
I already know you're the culprit who killed Mr. Nishida.

224
00:13:56,327 --> 00:14:00,727
I was in Guam on Friday night when Mr. Nishida died.

225
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:02,027
No, that's false.

226
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:05,927
Mr. Nishida wasn't killed on Friday night.

227
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:10,427
It was probably on Thursday,

228
00:14:10,427 --> 00:14:12,927
the day, before you left for Guam.

229
00:14:12,927 --> 00:14:16,527
That's why the bathroom light wasn't on.

230
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:20,127
Sunlight was already flooding in through the large windows.

231
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:23,227
That caused you to simply forget to switch on the light, didn't it?

232
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:25,027
What are you talking about?

233
00:14:25,027 --> 00:14:29,727
Didn't the police say Mr. Nishida's time of death was Friday night?

234
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:32,127
That's where your trick comes in.

235
00:14:32,127 --> 00:14:36,227
You cooled the body to delay the time of death, didn't you?

236
00:14:36,227 --> 00:14:38,327
Cooled the body?

237
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:41,527
The glue on the body's fingertips

238
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:43,827
had yet to dry, hadn't it?

239
00:14:43,827 --> 00:14:45,127
It's because under low temperatures,

240
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:48,127
it's difficult for the glue to dry.

241
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:50,027
Since the body was cooled,

242
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:53,427
the glue couldn't dry.

243
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:56,227
It... it's true that the time of death

244
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:59,027
can be delayed by cooling the body,

245
00:14:59,027 --> 00:15:02,127
but how do you cool the body?

246
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:04,827
Before I explain the method,

247
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:08,427
I have to first explain the tanks in this house.

248
00:15:08,427 --> 00:15:10,127
Tanks?

249
00:15:13,127 --> 00:15:16,127
Now, a question for the kids.

250
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:20,327
In the tank with the pirate ship miniature,

251
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:26,127
there was Caribbean Longsnout from the Caribbean Sea.

252
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:28,527
Do you know why?

253
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,327
Why?

254
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:33,427
As for the tank with the pufferfish from the Indian Ocean,

255
00:15:33,427 --> 00:15:37,727
why was the miniature of the Taj Mahal placed there?

256
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,127
I see.

257
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:42,227
The ocean that the fish is from in the tank

258
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:45,827
is represented by the miniature inside.

259
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:47,327
I see!

260
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:48,627
There was a movie that told

261
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:50,727
the story of pirates in the Caribbean sea, wasn't there?

262
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:53,027
That's why the tank with the pirate ship

263
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:55,727
has fish from the Caribbean sea!

264
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:59,327
The Taj Mahal is a famous temple in India!

265
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:02,627
That means fish from the India Ocean are kept in that tank, right?

266
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:06,627
Then, the tank with the pyramid has fish from the desert?

267
00:16:06,627 --> 00:16:08,327
Not quite.

268
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:11,827
Those fish are likely from the Red Sea, which is in Egypt.

269
00:16:11,827 --> 00:16:15,227
The Opera House is a building in Australia,

270
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:18,327
so that's the tank for fish from Australia!

271
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:20,427
That's right.

272
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:25,127
And the miniature that was supposed to be placed in this tank is

273
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:28,127
that clock tower from Sapporo!

274
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:29,727
Sapporo?

275
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:33,027
In other words, the fish that was supposed to be kept in the tank,

276
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:34,727
were not tropical fish,

277
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,627
but instead, fish from the sea around Hokkaido,

278
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:39,427
probably those from the Sea of Okhotsk!

279
00:16:39,427 --> 00:16:41,127
I see.

280
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:46,027
But how exactly is that related to the case?

281
00:16:46,027 --> 00:16:48,927
Try touching the glass of the tank.

282
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:56,927
-It's cold! -Like ice.

283
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:02,927
The Sea of Okhotsk is a cold sea in the north.

284
00:17:02,927 --> 00:17:05,227
To house the fish that come from there,

285
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:09,127
it's necessary to keep the temperature low.

286
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:10,927
In other words, there should be

287
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:14,927
a cooler in that tank to lower the water temperature.

288
00:17:18,227 --> 00:17:20,427
This... this should be it, right?

289
00:17:20,427 --> 00:17:22,927
Mr. Imura used the cooler

290
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:24,827
to cool the water in the bathtub,

291
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:26,727
so as to keep the body's temperature low,

292
00:17:26,727 --> 00:17:29,827
hence delaying the estimated time of death.

293
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:31,427
-What'd you say? -What'd you say?

294
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:34,127
Look carefully inside the tank.

295
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:38,327
There's evidence showing that the cooler was used to cool the body.

296
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,727
Could they be...

297
00:17:43,727 --> 00:17:46,127
Contact lens?

298
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:49,827
Yes, that would be Mr. Nishida's contact lens.

299
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:54,327
The contact lens case in the washroom is empty.

300
00:17:54,327 --> 00:17:58,627
As for why the contact lens would be in the tank,

301
00:17:58,627 --> 00:18:02,427
it's probably because Mr. Imura, who returned from Guam this morning,

302
00:18:02,427 --> 00:18:06,327
came to this house before we arrived.

303
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:08,327
This is because he had to put the cooler,

304
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:12,627
which had been used to cool the body, back into the original tank.

305
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:16,327
However, on the cooler bar that was in the bathtub,

306
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:18,227
the contact lens that had dropped out

307
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:21,427
from Mr. Nishida's eye was stuck on it.

308
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:26,027
Not noticing it, Mr. Imura returned the cooler to the tank.

309
00:18:26,027 --> 00:18:29,327
Hence the contact lens that was stuck on the bar

310
00:18:29,327 --> 00:18:32,527
fell into the tank.

311
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:35,627
All the shrimp in that tank died

312
00:18:35,627 --> 00:18:38,127
because you took away the cooler

313
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:40,227
and allowed the water temperature to rise.

314
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:43,427
Shrimp are highly susceptible to changes in water temperature.

315
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:46,727
I didn't come to the house this morning!

316
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:48,927
I came in for the first time with you, Doctor,

317
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,427
when I met you at the door.

318
00:18:50,427 --> 00:18:53,727
Do you remember the newspaper, Mr. Imura?

319
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:55,327
Newspaper?

320
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:59,527
When you saw the mailbox full of newspapers,

321
00:18:59,527 --> 00:19:02,227
you didn't appear to be very surprised at all.

322
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:07,427
That's because you knew that Mr. Nishida was dead, right?

323
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:12,227
You acted as though you met us at the door by coincidence,

324
00:19:12,227 --> 00:19:17,027
and let us in to discover the body.

325
00:19:17,027 --> 00:19:18,227
That's absurd!

326
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:19,627
That's just your wild guess!

327
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:22,027
There isn't any evidence!

328
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,827
Well, let's show you the evidence!

329
00:19:24,827 --> 00:19:25,827
What?

330
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:26,927
Mr. Tome.

331
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:31,627
Will you please conduct the test Conan required just now?

332
00:19:31,627 --> 00:19:32,827
Roger.

333
00:19:43,927 --> 00:19:46,027
Gunpowder reaction!

334
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:47,527
Gunpowder reaction?

335
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:49,927
When you fire a gun,

336
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:52,327
gunpowder will fly in all directions!

337
00:19:52,327 --> 00:19:55,827
Later, once sprayed with nitrous acid,

338
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,427
the gunpowder on clothes and furniture will react,

339
00:19:58,427 --> 00:20:00,827
and turn a purplish red.

340
00:20:03,627 --> 00:20:05,327
Oh, yeah.

341
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:08,527
You said when you left Guam on Saturday night,

342
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:12,127
you were firing guns at the shooting range, weren't you?

343
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,227
When you returned the cooler to the tank,

344
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:18,227
it must have touched the gunpowder on your clothes.

345
00:20:23,227 --> 00:20:24,527
Excuse me.

346
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,027
Darn it! Why did it?

347
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:33,927
I thought it was perfect.

348
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:36,127
The alibi that you worked so hard to create

349
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:38,527
has become the evidence that revealed your crime.

350
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:42,027
Why? Why did you kill Mr. Nishida?

351
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:44,727
I thought you respected him?

352
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:47,127
I did, until five years ago.

353
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:50,427
He was a genius aquarium designer.

354
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:54,527
I really... I really respected him.

355
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:56,627
Until five years ago?

356
00:20:56,627 --> 00:20:58,827
What exactly does that mean?

357
00:20:58,827 --> 00:21:03,127
Nishida stopped coming up with designs five years ago.

358
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:05,527
He'd used up his talent.

359
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:07,627
That's why in the last five years,

360
00:21:07,627 --> 00:21:11,327
all of his works were actually designed by me.

361
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:12,527
By you?

362
00:21:12,527 --> 00:21:14,227
Right.

363
00:21:14,227 --> 00:21:17,427
I have been Nishida's shadow.

364
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:20,127
But it was fine with me.

365
00:21:20,127 --> 00:21:21,527
Under the name of the genius designer,

366
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:23,627
as long as I could design what I liked!

367
00:21:23,627 --> 00:21:26,227
I was content being merely a shadow

368
00:21:26,227 --> 00:21:28,927
because I respected Nishida!

369
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:30,127
But then,

370
00:21:30,127 --> 00:21:33,127
when Nishida discovered talented people from the younger generation,

371
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:36,327
he discarded me and used them instead.

372
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:37,927
I couldn't forgive him!

373
00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:40,627
I had dedicated so much to him,

374
00:21:40,627 --> 00:21:42,627
and yet he cast me aside so readily.

375
00:21:42,627 --> 00:21:45,527
If he was going to abandon me,

376
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:48,727
then I decided to abandon him instead!

377
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:51,427
Or so I thought...

378
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:21,327
"One week later" -The fish were so cute!

379
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:23,427
They were so pretty!

380
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:26,127
The big shark was really cool!

381
00:23:26,127 --> 00:23:28,827
Those schools of sardines were great too!

382
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:30,527
Instead of that,

383
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:32,227
I'm hungry.

384
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:33,827
Now that you mention it...

385
00:23:33,827 --> 00:23:37,427
It's already 2:00 in the afternoon.

386
00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:39,527
Let's go eat something.

387
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:41,527
All right!

388
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:43,527
What would you like to eat?

389
00:23:45,627 --> 00:23:47,327
Grilled eel!

390
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:49,127
Sashimi would be nice!

391
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,927
I wanna eat sushi!

392
00:23:50,927 --> 00:23:52,227
Hey, hey.

393
00:23:52,227 --> 00:23:56,027
You're going to eat the fish that you just said were cute?

394
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:58,227
You don't say...

395
00:23:58,227 --> 00:24:00,427
"Next Episode"

396
00:24:00,427 --> 00:24:01,927
So, it's a play on words tori otoko (Rooster Man)

397
00:24:01,927 --> 00:24:04,927
and mono tori (thief). That's why he's called Rooster Man?

398
00:24:04,927 --> 00:24:07,327
Rooster Man is really a turn-off, isn't it?

399
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:10,227
Why are you guys here again?

400
00:24:10,227 --> 00:24:12,527
We came to get the love oracle!

401
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:15,427
Nine?

402
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:19,127
Not a bird, but a monkey.

403
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:20,827
Nine...

404
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:22,827
What exactly is it?

405
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:24,227
Next Conan,

406
00:24:24,227 --> 00:24:28,227
"The Tori's Pledge of Monkey and Rake (Part 1)".

407
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:46,427
Next Conan's Hint:

408
00:24:46,427 --> 00:24:48,627
"Button".

409
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:49,627
The kind that you push, isn't it?

410
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:50,627
The other kind.

411
00:24:50,627 --> 00:24:53,127
The kind that comes falling to the bottom-windfall.
