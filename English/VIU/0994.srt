1
00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:02,273
Due to a misunderstanding,

2
00:00:02,274 --> 00:00:06,264
Kyogoku-san accidentally knocked out a stuntman filming a TV drama.

3
00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:11,874
He was recruited to fill in for the stuntman, but...

4
00:00:15,174 --> 00:00:17,464
Looks pretty good. It's got intensity.

5
00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:22,684
So, has anyone seen Tokuzono-chan?

6
00:00:26,784 --> 00:00:28,014
Hey, we're not ready ye—

7
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:38,844
Excuse me.

8
00:00:40,244 --> 00:00:42,024
Is something wrong?

9
00:00:44,284 --> 00:00:45,384
Makoto-san!

10
00:00:48,054 --> 00:00:49,863
Find the question that solves the mystery!

11
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:51,983
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

12
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:54,083
Sera turns her detective skills onto a new target:

13
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:56,163
the suspicious pair of Conan and Kudo Shinichi!

14
00:00:56,164 --> 00:00:57,803
Always determining the one truth

15
00:00:57,804 --> 00:00:59,543
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

16
00:00:59,544 --> 00:01:02,084
his name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:51,013
Kyogoku Makoto the Understudy (Part Two)

18
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:14,783
Even if the culprit placed Tokuzono-san's phone outside the fourth floor window,

19
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:18,622
how did they get him to fall?

20
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:20,043
Indeed.

21
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,382
If Tokuzono-san was afraid of heights,

22
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:26,043
he wouldn't have gone outside the window.

23
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:29,233
He wasn't afraid of heights.

24
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,672
If anything, he loved high places.

25
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:42,263
He wouldn't have had any trouble retrieving his phone from that kind of place.

26
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,273
Is that medicine?

27
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:47,203
They're iron supplements.

28
00:03:47,383 --> 00:03:50,262
I'm on a diet, and remember what I said earlier?

29
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,213
I run out of breath easily these days.

30
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:56,302
I see. I bet you could fit a little device in that case.

31
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,963
Hey, don't assume I'm the culprit just because of this.

32
00:03:59,203 --> 00:04:03,973
Hideka-chan uses a case just like this one for her allergy capsules,

33
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:08,973
and Hoegi-kun the AD had a box of cold medicine in his pocket.

34
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:13,903
Even the director's got a ramune case.

35
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:19,283
In the first place, there are plenty of similar small containers around the filming location.

36
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:22,913
The medicines and cases don't seem related.

37
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:26,783
Medicine, huh?

38
00:04:27,073 --> 00:04:32,043
Speaking of medicine, Ran-kun, I have a question for you.

39
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:36,293
Does your boyfriend take any strange medicines?

40
00:04:36,473 --> 00:04:37,153
What?

41
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:40,423
Boyfriend? You mean Shinichi?

42
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:44,433
You know, sometimes he seems really ill.

43
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:45,802
You're right.

44
00:04:45,803 --> 00:04:48,942
He's frequently pale and seems to be on the brink of death,

45
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:51,933
but a short while later, he'll be fine again.

46
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:56,443
You think he's taking some kind of medicine?

47
00:04:57,763 --> 00:05:03,642
Does that phrasing mean you've never seen him take anything?

48
00:05:03,643 --> 00:05:04,993
No.

49
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:07,993
Then, to be blunt,

50
00:05:08,243 --> 00:05:10,323
when Shinichi-kun is around...

51
00:05:11,993 --> 00:05:15,443
Is Conan-kun absent?

52
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:19,633
Wh-What does that mean?

53
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:21,873
What does that mean?

54
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:25,633
It means exactly what it sounds like.

55
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:37,003
Isn't that right, Ran-kun?

56
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:41,522
Conan-kun and Shinichi-kun have never been in the same—

57
00:05:41,523 --> 00:05:43,903
They've been in the same place before.

58
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:46,092
What? They have?

59
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,092
Yeah. Right, Sonoko?

60
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:51,132
They were there together at the school festival.

61
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:53,163
Yeah, I remember that.

62
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:55,663
Both during the play about the black knight

63
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:58,923
and when Shinichi-kun started solving the case,

64
00:05:59,323 --> 00:06:02,253
the kid was there watching with a sour look on his face.

65
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:06,612
And when I went to get Shinichi for school the next day,

66
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:08,433
Conan-kun was with us.

67
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:15,183
That's when Haibara disguised herself as me

68
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:17,913
using the professor's mask-shaped voice changer.

69
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:22,693
Oh, I actually quite enjoy this.

70
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:28,732
Do you think Conan-kun and Shinichi are the same person?

71
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:30,652
What? Uh, yeah.

72
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:33,453
I thought the same thing a few times.

73
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,942
But I've changed my mind.

74
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:38,693
There's no such thing as magic.

75
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:44,713
Conan-kun is just Conan-kun.

76
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:45,963
Yeah!

77
00:06:54,473 --> 00:06:56,842
I can't figure it out.

78
00:06:56,843 --> 00:07:01,233
What did the culprit do to make the victim fall?

79
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:05,232
We know they plotted to make Tokuzono-san fall

80
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:07,993
by placing his phone outside the window,

81
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,243
but that wouldn't guarantee that he'd fall.

82
00:07:11,673 --> 00:07:14,162
We're missing something essential.

83
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:15,782
No, wait.

84
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:18,052
When Tokuzono-san fell,

85
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:20,923
the rest of the staff were down here directly below the window.

86
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:25,412
It's possible that they waited for Tokuzono-san

87
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:27,173
to reach for his phone and called him then.

88
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:31,552
If they could choose different ringtones according to the caller,

89
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:34,762
they could have set it to some kind of loud noise

90
00:07:34,763 --> 00:07:39,183
so that Tokuzono-san would be startled, lose his balance, and fall.

91
00:07:39,423 --> 00:07:43,522
Kyogoku-kun did mention hearing a strange noise

92
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:46,483
just before Tokuzono-san fell.

93
00:07:46,823 --> 00:07:47,972
I see.

94
00:07:47,973 --> 00:07:51,332
In that case, we may be able to identify the culprit

95
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,952
if we look through that phone's call history.

96
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:54,843
Yeah.

97
00:07:54,844 --> 00:07:55,873
Kyogoku-kun!

98
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:02,852
You said you heard a strange noise just before Tokuzono-san fell.

99
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:04,262
You're sure about that?

100
00:08:04,263 --> 00:08:05,003
Yes.

101
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:10,763
And it was a noisy ringtone, right?

102
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:11,913
No.

103
00:08:11,914 --> 00:08:15,622
If anything, it was like the flutter or buzz

104
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:18,393
of a bird of insect flapping its wings.

105
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:21,273
It was quiet.

106
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,023
A bird or insect?

107
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:27,962
Come to think of it, Tokuzono-chan hated bugs.

108
00:08:27,963 --> 00:08:29,483
Right, Odori-kun?

109
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:34,332
Yeah, he was unusually terrified of them.

110
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,993
If a single bug flew his way while we were filming, he'd lose his mind.

111
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:43,332
Then was this just an accident that happened because he was startled by a bug?

112
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,452
Even then!

113
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:48,503
That doesn't change the fact that his phone was in an unnatural place.

114
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:51,562
Anyway, what are we going to do about the shoot?

115
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:53,222
It's obviously canceled.

116
00:08:53,223 --> 00:08:54,763
We can't film under these circumstances.

117
00:08:55,063 --> 00:08:58,922
Then could I remove these fake wounds?

118
00:08:58,923 --> 00:09:01,273
I have a gravure shoot after this.

119
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:05,522
Sure. We don't know when we'll be able to film the rest, anyway.

120
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:07,302
Hideka-chan, could you?

121
00:09:07,303 --> 00:09:08,023
Okay.

122
00:09:08,303 --> 00:09:11,533
Aburai-san, you can make wounds with makeup?

123
00:09:11,713 --> 00:09:14,332
Yeah, as long as it's simple.

124
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,033
My boyfriend liked special effects.

125
00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:22,202
Don't touch the cut on my temple.

126
00:09:22,203 --> 00:09:23,822
It's real.

127
00:09:23,823 --> 00:09:25,463
Yeah, I kno—

128
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:30,082
Isn't it time for you to take your allergy medicine?

129
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:30,923
Yeah.

130
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:35,122
But I can't swallow capsules without water.

131
00:09:35,123 --> 00:09:37,702
I can wait a little longer.

132
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:41,433
Then I'll go buy drinks at the nearby Welcome Burger.

133
00:09:41,883 --> 00:09:46,322
I'd like to take my cold medicine, so I'll buy drinks for the staff.

134
00:09:46,323 --> 00:09:47,693
Let's take a break for tea.

135
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:49,622
For the staff?

136
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,323
Can you carry all of that?

137
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:52,683
I'll be fine.

138
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:54,773
I'll go with Nishibe.

139
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:59,622
Oh, right. Nishibe isn't here.

140
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:02,203
Anyway, I'll buy the usual stuff.

141
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:04,972
Do you guys want anything in particular?

142
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:05,843
No.

143
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:08,272
Conan-kun, do you want anything to drink?

144
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:09,963
I'm good with anything.

145
00:10:10,883 --> 00:10:12,863
I'm fine, thank you.

146
00:10:13,303 --> 00:10:15,983
Then I'll get our regular order plus five more.

147
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:19,052
Takagi-kun, go with him.

148
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:19,973
Yes, sir.

149
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:22,563
Hey.

150
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:28,233
Is Nishibe the name of the dead AD?

151
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:30,983
You were listening to that?

152
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:32,842
Yeah, that's right.

153
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:34,832
Nishibe-kun was an AD.

154
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,852
His face was just my type.

155
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:38,493
I was pursuing him.

156
00:10:41,863 --> 00:10:44,243
But Hideka-chan the makeup artist snagged him.

157
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:47,752
Then her boyfriend who liked special effects was...

158
00:10:47,753 --> 00:10:48,613
Yeah.

159
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:52,753
He and Hoegi-kun the AD who just went to buy drinks loved special effects.

160
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:55,322
He and Director Tomioka grew up in the same place.

161
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:58,733
They'd check each other's Hiroshima dialect to make sure they hadn't forgotten it.

162
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:03,842
When I see this scar, I think of him.

163
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,013
Why?

164
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:09,643
Nishibe-kun was supposed to come pick me up from a certain on location shoot.

165
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:11,673
But he overslept.

166
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:20,022
I saw the news about that accident.

167
00:11:20,023 --> 00:11:22,743
It was a drunk driver, right?

168
00:11:23,703 --> 00:11:28,293
He didn't hit me, but I hit my head when I fell.

169
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:32,562
When I came to, I was in a hospital bed.

170
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:37,062
Nishibe-kun was asleep in a chair, his hands covered in blood.

171
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:40,133
Apparently he showed up late and did everything he could.

172
00:11:40,423 --> 00:11:42,212
His hands were covered in blood?

173
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:45,143
The cut required four stitches, and I lost a lot of blood.

174
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:50,273
Nishibe-kun applied pressure with a handkerchief until the ambulance arrived.

175
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,522
I'm so sorry about that.

176
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:57,832
He overslept because he was up late watching DVDs with me.

177
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,722
It doesn't bother me anymore.

178
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:01,653
Besides, it didn't leave much of a scar.

179
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:08,292
But he really regretted scarring an actress's face.

180
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:10,632
And then he was pranked by that bleeding soap.

181
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:13,423
Tokuzono-chan had a messed up sense of humor.

182
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:19,743
No wonder Nishibe screamed like a dying man.

183
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:26,492
Oh, sorry.

184
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:27,933
Excuse me.

185
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,369
I got the drinks.

186
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,644
I had the officer help me carry a bunch of them.

187
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:49,038
Let's see, which is whose?

188
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,709
I'll help.

189
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:53,629
This is an iced coffee, so...

190
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:54,739
That's mine.

191
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:58,139
Here's your milk, syrup, and straw.

192
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:02,448
Aburai-san, you ordered the iced tea, right?

193
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,269
Yeah.

194
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,568
This is a hassle.

195
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:06,998
It's fine. We'll get our own orders.

196
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:07,309
Huh?

197
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:08,598
I got a cola.

198
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:09,319
Coffee.

199
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,688
Any ginger ales?

200
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:11,689
Hey, wait.

201
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,848
This banana strawberry shake and peach melon shake are Odori-san and Jinmei-san's.

202
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:19,529
Don't take them.

203
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:22,318
The AD's usual order, huh?

204
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:24,298
Jinmei-san, you got a shake, too?

205
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:27,428
Yeah, I sent Hoegi-kun a message earlier asking for one.

206
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:28,539
I felt like having one.

207
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:30,979
But which is which?

208
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:34,049
I can't tell by looking at them.

209
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:37,579
Which means I need to have a little taste.

210
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:45,058
This one's peach melon, so it's Odori-san's.

211
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:48,108
Jeez. There are stickers on the bottoms.

212
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:50,008
You just wanted to taste them.

213
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,569
Huh? There aren't enough straws for the shakes.

214
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:57,048
This is a regular straw, but the AD can have it.

215
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,819
I'm not using mine.

216
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:01,968
Then I'll bring it to him.

217
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:03,699
Besides, I need to talk to him.

218
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,948
Hey, Odori-kun.

219
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:08,418
Here's your usual shake.

220
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:10,378
Thanks.

221
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:12,158
You sure do like these.

222
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:14,969
Yeah. I got into them after trying one once.

223
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:17,368
Sir, would you like a sip?

224
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:18,498
No, thanks.

225
00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:20,538
What did you want to discuss?

226
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:22,218
You mentioned something about that earlier.

227
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:27,308
Huh? Oh, it's about the late Tokuzono-chan's replacement.

228
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:28,999
Well, it can wait.

229
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:40,409
When are we going to talk?

230
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:43,399
How impatient.

231
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,518
Odori-san?

232
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,939
Is this a joke?

233
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,038
Hey, Odori-kun.

234
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,889
This is a joke, right?

235
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:15,568
Are you—

236
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:16,189
Move.

237
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:19,638
His mouth smells like almonds.

238
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,109
It's cyanide.

239
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:24,199
I don't think you should touch that.

240
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:28,398
He was probably poisoned.

241
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,329
What?

242
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:32,098
Right, Sera-no-neechan?

243
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:32,959
Yeah.

244
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:39,999
We currently believe the poison to be a type of cyanide compound.

245
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:45,268
Do you ever use that type of chemical while filming?

246
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:46,969
Not on location.

247
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:51,768
If anything, I think we might use it in the prop studio.

248
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:56,388
Which means your staff could have gotten their hands on a poison?

249
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,279
I didn't say that.

250
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:03,818
Either way, we can assume they acquired the poison beforehand.

251
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:04,619
Yeah.

252
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,478
Is this everything Odori-san had on him?

253
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:11,869
Y-Yeah.

254
00:16:15,989 --> 00:16:17,629
Hey, what's that?

255
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:20,498
That thing that looks like a butterfly.

256
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:22,048
Oh, this?

257
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:26,639
It was wrapped in a handkerchief and carefully tucked away inside his pants pocket.

258
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:28,889
What is this?

259
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,389
You've found a fun toy, haven't you?

260
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:32,539
A toy?

261
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,659
Yeah, I've seen them somewhere.

262
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:38,358
I don't know why Odori-kun had one, though.

263
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:39,899
How does it work?

264
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:43,399
You turn the wings on top.

265
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,909
Once the rubber band is sufficiently wound,

266
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,909
you stick it inside a notebook or something.

267
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,409
Jinmei-chan.

268
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,678
Try opening this notebook.

269
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,778
We're doing this now?

270
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,669
I heard your conversation.

271
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,488
That thing you stuck in here will come flying out, right?

272
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:03,589
You can't scare me when I know what to expect.

273
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:08,429
No!

274
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:09,708
What is this?

275
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:11,298
It's so creepy.

276
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:12,679
Look at it fly.

277
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:16,309
Th-That's the sound.

278
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,279
What?

279
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:23,309
That's the flapping noise I heard just before Tokuzono-san fell.

280
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:28,949
The sound that toy just made is the same as the sound I heard then.

281
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:32,408
What? Which means...

282
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:37,208
That was set somewhere on the fourth floor.

283
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:41,879
But according to the staff, these practical joke devices were a favorite of...

284
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:44,629
Yeah, Tokuzono-san.

285
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:48,378
Tokuzono-san had tons of practical joke devices.

286
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:52,639
He often pranked me and the other girls.

287
00:17:52,829 --> 00:18:01,148
Then it's possible Tokuzono-san himself was trying to set this device and slipped.

288
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:02,729
That doesn't make sense.

289
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:06,408
After all, doesn't Tokuzono-san hate bugs?

290
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:09,239
He wouldn't use a toy bug as a prank.

291
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:11,058
You're right.

292
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:15,249
Just today he lost his temper because he mistook some fake lashes for a centipede.

293
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:18,959
Even if it's not real, he couldn't stand things that look like bugs.

294
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:25,278
If it made a noise, that means the rubber band powering the toy was wound up.

295
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,389
Once the rubber band is wound, something needs to hold it down until it's ready to fly.

296
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:33,139
It would need to be stuck between the pages of a notebook,

297
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:36,139
or have something set on top of it.

298
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:40,319
Odori-san had that toy in his possession?

299
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:42,689
Inspector.

300
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:49,029
No poison was found in the shake, cup, or straw Odori-san was using.

301
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:55,308
Maybe they swapped out the entire cup during the confusion.

302
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:57,658
The cup contained a peach melon shake.

303
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:00,289
Nobody besides Odori-san ordered one.

304
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:04,228
Then maybe they swapped out just the poisoned straw.

305
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:05,799
I don't think so.

306
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:09,818
If you hastily pull out a straw, its contents should drip back into the cup,

307
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:11,508
but there was no sign of that.

308
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:13,808
They didn't have time to remove it carefully either.

309
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:15,538
Then how?

310
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,018
It's just one possibility,

311
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:22,308
but Odori-san himself could have taken a poison he acquired beforehand.

312
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:24,319
S-Suicide?

313
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:26,988
But why would the AD do that?

314
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:31,069
Because Odori-san made Tokuzono-san fall.

315
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:34,078
And couldn't stand the guilt?

316
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,208
Hold on.

317
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:38,448
Why would Odori-kun kill Tokuzono-chan?

318
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:43,079
They loved swapping twisted jokes with each other.

319
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:45,388
He didn't mean to kill him.

320
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:51,589
The AD probably tried to prank Tokuzono-san the way he always pranked others.

321
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,969
But he took the unexpected accident to heart and poisoned himself.

322
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:59,398
That doesn't make sense either.

323
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:03,228
If it was a prank, he wouldn't need to acquire the poison beforehand.

324
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:06,218
And Odori-san didn't have a motive for murder.

325
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:08,529
I can't imagine why he'd kill himself.

326
00:20:09,569 --> 00:20:12,739
Why did Odori-san have that butterfly?

327
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:15,989
If it's something he picked up, it was probably then.

328
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,999
Was he killed because he figured out the culprit's identity?

329
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:21,488
But it could have been set by any of the staff

330
00:20:21,489 --> 00:20:26,369
who were filming on the fourth floor until just before then.

331
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:33,359
He must've determined the culprit's identity based off some other information, but what?

332
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:41,349
Come to think of it, Odori-san laughed after seeing the footage of Tokuzono-san's fall.

333
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:46,858
But there wasn't anything particularly interesting in that footage.

334
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:48,018
Hold on.

335
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:51,359
We can probably narrow down the people who could've poisoned Odori-san.

336
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:55,688
It was the AD Hoegi-san who bought that shake.

337
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:58,368
Odori-san always ordered the same shake,

338
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:01,539
so it would be possible to poison it while purchasing the drink.

339
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:04,809
Hoegi-san was also the one who inserted the straw.

340
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,379
What about Jinmei-san?

341
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:13,259
She sent a message ordering a different shake and tasted Odori-san's shake.

342
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,168
If she poisoned the straw then,

343
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:19,649
she could've mixed it into the shake by gently blowing through the straw.

344
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:26,449
Speaking of straws, Aburai-san gave her own straw to Odori-san.

345
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,998
She could've poisoned that.

346
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:32,139
She's also the reason the drinks were purchased.

347
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:36,489
But I can't swallow capsules without water.

348
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:41,489
And it was Tomioka-san who handed Odori-san his shake.

349
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:44,598
He had plenty of chances, too.

350
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,999
And he tried to pick up the cup immediately.

351
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:52,509
In other words, these four could've poisoned the shake.

352
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:55,068
But...

353
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:56,168
Yeah.

354
00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:00,449
For some reason, no poison was found in Odori-san's drink.

355
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:01,648
Yeah.

356
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:04,308
However it was poisoned,

357
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:07,998
there should be poison in the shake itself or the container.

358
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:12,098
And if we can't figure that out, we can't make any progress.

359
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:13,169
Right, Conan-kun?

360
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,788
Rather, Kudo Shinichi-kun?

361
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:19,429
Well, yeah.

362
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,058
Look closely.

363
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:53,999
See? I'm a child.

364
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:57,789
Yeah, that's what an ordinary person would think.

365
00:23:58,499 --> 00:24:01,239
There's no way I could ever tell them.

366
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,199
I need to keep an eye on them so Sera doesn't ask any weird questions.

367
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:08,139
Huh?

368
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:14,149
I see. It's the cap.

369
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:19,399
The next episode of Conan is, "Kyogoku Makoto the Understudy, Part Three!"
