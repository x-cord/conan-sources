1
00:00:02,172 --> 00:00:05,172
"Toto Tower."

2
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:12,109
Is something already happening?

3
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:13,747
What is it?

4
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:15,347
There's smoke coming out.

5
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:19,847
I wonder if a bomb was set up here after all.

6
00:00:19,848 --> 00:00:23,147
I'll go ask what happened,

7
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,947
so you kids wait in the car.

8
00:00:25,948 --> 00:00:27,148
Okay?

9
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:33,047
We were scheduled to bring you

10
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:35,947
a special on Toto Towers mascot Toto today,

11
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:38,047
but due to an accident,

12
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:40,847
we have inevitably changed the schedule.

13
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:44,047
Excuse me. What on earth has happened?

14
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:45,548
You see, the thing is...

15
00:00:46,348 --> 00:00:49,147
What? The bomb is inside Toto Tower?

16
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:51,647
Yes, I'm pretty sure.

17
00:00:51,648 --> 00:00:54,147
Just what do you mean? Tell me about it in detail, will you?

18
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:59,347
Yes. Just before I got here, there was a small explosion,

19
00:00:59,348 --> 00:01:01,847
and the elevator seems to have stopped.

20
00:01:01,848 --> 00:01:03,747
-What? -It's most likely that

21
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:06,447
the suspect thinking that the police located the bomb,

22
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:09,648
used a remote control to set off the explosion.

23
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:15,047
The control room of the Ferris Wheel suddenly blew up.

24
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:17,148
We can't stop the wheel.

25
00:01:18,648 --> 00:01:21,547
It's the same as back then.

26
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:26,847
I'll go over to the elevator that had stopped and check things out.

27
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:27,947
No!

28
00:01:27,948 --> 00:01:31,647
That bomb has been set to lure officers there. It's a trap!

29
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,947
What? A trap?

30
00:01:34,948 --> 00:01:38,547
I'll be there in 5 minutes, so wait there until I get there.

31
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:39,747
Understand?

32
00:01:39,748 --> 00:01:41,147
Okay.

33
00:01:41,148 --> 00:01:43,348
Hey, we've got trouble!

34
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:47,647
It seems that a girl's been trapped in the elevator that stopped

35
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:49,847
because of the explosion a while ago.

36
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:51,747
What?

37
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:55,147
Officer Sato, a child is in the elevator.

38
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,447
Calm down.

39
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:59,647
We've still got two hours to go before the predicted time of bombing.

40
00:01:59,648 --> 00:02:04,347
But I'd better go and check things out as soon as possible.

41
00:02:04,348 --> 00:02:05,647
Don't worry.

42
00:02:05,648 --> 00:02:08,947
I'll work something out, so you just stay there.

43
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:10,647
But...

44
00:02:10,648 --> 00:02:12,447
Listen here, Takagi.

45
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:15,247
Make sure Miwako stays out of dangerous situations.

46
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:18,147
I'll rescue that girl. I promise!

47
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:19,347
But...

48
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:22,347
Who knows what she might do later.

49
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:24,647
Understand? This is an order!

50
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:28,047
You stay there until I get there.

51
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,648
Understand, Officer Takagi?

52
00:02:31,148 --> 00:02:33,947
Hey, Officer Takagi. Can you hear me?

53
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:36,647
Officer Takagi, answer me!

54
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:38,347
Hey, Officer Takagi!

55
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:40,347
Officer Takagi!

56
00:02:40,348 --> 00:02:42,748
Please, Officer Takagi! Don't go!

57
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:47,948
I'm going.

58
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:55,447
I'm going to check how things are inside.

59
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:57,448
Officer Takagi!

60
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,547
All of you!

61
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:06,347
I'm going to go inside the tower now,

62
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:09,147
so you all stay still and wait here, okay?

63
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:10,447
What?

64
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:12,247
Understand?

65
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:13,847
Yes, sir.

66
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:15,748
I'll be right back!

67
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:19,548
I wonder if Officer Takagi is going to be okay.

68
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:23,548
-Ai, take care of everybody, okay? -What?

69
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:27,247
-Hey, Conan! -Conan!

70
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,847
What? Are you going too, Conan?

71
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:33,047
I'm just going to go check how things are.

72
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:36,147
You guys keep watch and make sure nobody suspicious

73
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:37,447
comes near this car.

74
00:03:37,448 --> 00:03:38,847
But...

75
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:42,847
We'll be in big trouble if a bomb is set up on this car again, right?

76
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,747
But I know you guys, the Youth Detective Squad,

77
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:48,147
will be able to take care of things even if I'm not around, right?

78
00:03:48,148 --> 00:03:49,747
Well, I guess.

79
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:51,247
Leave it to us.

80
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:52,847
See you!

81
00:03:52,848 --> 00:03:54,548
Be careful, Conan!

82
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:05,747
According to the report from Officer Takagi,

83
00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:07,047
about 15 minutes ago,

84
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:12,247
there was a small explosion near the special observatory area.

85
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:16,847
It seems that one elevator of this observatory is stalled.

86
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:20,147
Only it hasn't been confirmed whether this explosion

87
00:04:20,148 --> 00:04:23,347
was due to a bomb or an accident.

88
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:28,547
It much too resembles the case of 3 years ago to be an accident.

89
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:30,347
True.

90
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:32,748
There's probably no doubt about it.

91
00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:36,447
Emergency, emergency!

92
00:04:36,448 --> 00:04:38,247
From MPD to all stations.

93
00:04:38,248 --> 00:04:39,847
There is a high possibility that

94
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:42,547
a bomb has been set at Toto Towers in Minato Ward.

95
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,347
Head to the site on the double

96
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:47,347
and block off the entrance to Toto Tower.

97
00:04:47,348 --> 00:04:50,748
Secure an evacuation site for the citizens in the vicinity.

98
00:04:52,448 --> 00:04:53,748
Officer Takagi.

99
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:57,647
Emergency announcement to all visitors.

100
00:04:57,648 --> 00:05:02,347
We are very sorry to announce that we will be closing for the day.

101
00:05:02,348 --> 00:05:04,647
Please follow the instructions of the guide

102
00:05:04,648 --> 00:05:07,147
and leave the tower immediately.

103
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:11,147
Please remain calm, and move along without rushing.

104
00:05:11,148 --> 00:05:14,047
Excuse me, police. Please let me through!

105
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,147
Please don't panic.

106
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:20,247
Police! Where's the elevator that stopped?

107
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:22,747
It's the one at the very end.

108
00:05:22,748 --> 00:05:24,547
Thanks.

109
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:27,647
Akemi, you'll be fine. Don't be afraid. Come on out.

110
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:29,247
Police.

111
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:32,547
This is the elevator that the girl is trap in?

112
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:33,947
Yes, sir.

113
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:35,547
-It came down from the top floor... -Akemi...

114
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:39,747
and stopped just before reaching the observatory.

115
00:05:39,748 --> 00:05:42,747
Akemi. What are you doing, Akemi?

116
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:45,547
Hurry and come out! Come over here!

117
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:47,047
Akemi!

118
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:49,547
Only one child was in the elevator

119
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:51,847
but she's so scared that she won't listen to her mother

120
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:54,247
telling her to come out.

121
00:05:54,248 --> 00:05:57,847
This space is too small for an adult to get through.

122
00:05:57,848 --> 00:05:59,647
Will you carry me up then?

123
00:05:59,648 --> 00:06:00,847
What?

124
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:02,947
I can make it inside, can't I?

125
00:06:02,948 --> 00:06:04,848
Conan.

126
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:09,847
We continue to bring you live broadcast news from Toto Tower.

127
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:13,147
Today, at approximately 9:45 a.m.,

128
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:15,347
there was an explosion inside Toto Tower.

129
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:17,147
The cause of the explosion is still unknown.

130
00:06:17,148 --> 00:06:19,947
Fortunately, no casualties have been reported,

131
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:21,347
but due to the impact of the explosion,

132
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,547
one of the elevators have stopped.

133
00:06:24,548 --> 00:06:27,647
A four years old girl who happened to be on the elevator

134
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:29,547
is trapped inside.

135
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:33,248
Presently, while trying to find the cause of the explosion...

136
00:06:49,948 --> 00:06:51,647
Conan, are you all right?

137
00:06:51,648 --> 00:06:52,947
Yes.

138
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:55,648
Hello, Akemi.

139
00:06:57,348 --> 00:07:01,848
I'm going to go over to you now, so hold on, okay?

140
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:09,647
Akemi, what a cute teddy bear.

141
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:11,648
What's its name?

142
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:15,147
Jam.

143
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:18,447
What a cute name! Is he a boy?

144
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:20,347
Yes.

145
00:07:20,348 --> 00:07:24,947
I want to go over and say hello to Jam.

146
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:26,247
Is it okay?

147
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:27,747
Yes, it's okay.

148
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,548
I'm going over there, okay?

149
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:33,647
We just got a report that

150
00:07:33,648 --> 00:07:36,647
a police officer went into the elevator

151
00:07:36,648 --> 00:07:40,148
to rescue the girl that is trapped inside.

152
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:44,047
What? A child went into the elevator?

153
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:45,648
It can't be!

154
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:54,047
And mommy bought me Jam for my birthday.

155
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:58,247
I see. Since mommy's waiting outside, shall we go?

156
00:07:58,248 --> 00:07:59,448
Yes.

157
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:10,648
Okay, come. Good girl.

158
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:14,047
-Mommy! -Akemi!

159
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:15,347
Mommy!

160
00:08:15,348 --> 00:08:16,847
-Akemi! -Mommy!

161
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:18,548
Akemi!

162
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:24,948
-Okay, Conan, now you. -Yes!

163
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:35,748
Conan!

164
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:39,048
Gosh!

165
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:52,347
And? You went off wanting to look cool,

166
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:55,647
and now you're trapped in the elevator with Conan.

167
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:57,947
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:57,948 --> 00:09:03,147
By the way, are you sure there's no bomb in that elevator?

169
00:09:03,148 --> 00:09:08,547
No, there's nothing that looks like a bomb here in the elevator.

170
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,648
I'm going check the top of the elevator now.

171
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:26,747
Do you know about where you are now?

172
00:09:26,748 --> 00:09:28,447
Probably...

173
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:30,647
All the wires seem to have been severed,

174
00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:33,247
so I think with the emergency stop

175
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:38,247
we are in the middle of the observatory and roof of the tower building.

176
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:39,248
Is that right?

177
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:41,847
I guess I'll have to climb to the ceiling

178
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,147
and wait for the rescue squad.

179
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:46,247
No, don't climb up to the ceiling!

180
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:48,847
The mercury lever will operate!

181
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:51,547
The mercury lever?

182
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:53,148
Mercury lever?

183
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:57,347
A slight shake can make the mercury-drop roll,

184
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:59,448
and if the drop touches the wire, that's it.

185
00:10:00,448 --> 00:10:04,347
Conan, what's a mercury lever?

186
00:10:04,348 --> 00:10:07,147
It's a part of the trigger device of the bomb.

187
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,347
It's a bomb big enough that is capable of

188
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:11,847
not only blowing up this elevator

189
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:13,748
but the entire Toto Tower as well.

190
00:10:25,736 --> 00:10:28,035
A bomb?

191
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:30,735
On the ceiling of this elevator?

192
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:34,435
Are you sure about that, Conan?

193
00:10:34,436 --> 00:10:39,835
Yes. I saw bombs that looks just like this one on TV.

194
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:42,935
I heard that if it's just one type of liquid it's okay,

195
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:44,335
but when it mixes with the other liquid,

196
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:46,935
it turns into a very strong bomb.

197
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:49,035
Then, wouldn't it be more the reason

198
00:10:49,036 --> 00:10:51,935
to have the rescue squad come here?

199
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:56,035
I just said that the mercury lever is set, didn't I?

200
00:10:56,036 --> 00:10:58,935
It's most likely that the switch went on

201
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:00,836
with the impact of the elevator stopping just a while ago.

202
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:04,735
The switch of the trigger device

203
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:07,535
that will go off with the slightest shake.

204
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:11,235
So if you climb up to this roof

205
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:13,535
or if the rescue squad comes down here with a rope,

206
00:11:13,536 --> 00:11:15,835
the minute they set foot on the ground

207
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:19,536
and even if it shakes just a little bit, it's boom!

208
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:24,135
Is it that strong?

209
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:25,936
The mercury lever.

210
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:29,836
Mercury lever...

211
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:33,135
Just as I thought.

212
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:34,635
I'm sure that the one who set this up

213
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:37,136
is the same bomber as three years ago.

214
00:11:40,136 --> 00:11:43,936
Then, don't tell me that...

215
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:49,535
Then, why don't we have them lower a rope from the elevator door above

216
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:51,535
and we both climb and escape?

217
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:53,935
I don't think that will work either.

218
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:55,135
What?

219
00:11:55,136 --> 00:11:59,735
There's wire tap near the bomb.

220
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:02,235
So, I'm sure that as soon as the bomber

221
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:04,635
is listening to our conversation from somewhere.

222
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:07,935
And the minute we leave here and he stops hearing our conversation,

223
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,835
he's planning to turn on the switch and set the bomb off.

224
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:14,735
Which means we're trapped either way.

225
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:17,336
No, we still have one way out.

226
00:12:20,536 --> 00:12:23,635
I have to disassemble this bomb.

227
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:27,036
I need them to lower the bomb disposal tool from above though.

228
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:31,935
I repeat.

229
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:34,035
All citizens within the vicinity of Toto Tower,

230
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:38,435
please follow the instructions of the police and evacuate to safety.

231
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:41,435
-What? -Are we running away?

232
00:12:41,436 --> 00:12:45,435
Conan and Officer Takagi are still in there.

233
00:12:45,436 --> 00:12:48,135
No need to worry,

234
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:51,835
because those two are probably heading this way already.

235
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:55,335
Officer Chiba, please take the children to a safe place.

236
00:12:55,336 --> 00:12:57,535
Okay.

237
00:12:57,536 --> 00:13:01,235
The two are going to dispose of the bomb.

238
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:03,235
What?

239
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:05,535
The bomb disposal squad is not even going into the tower

240
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:09,235
and are waiting for communication,

241
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:11,535
so that's what it means, right?

242
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:13,335
They'll be okay.

243
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:15,635
The composition of the bomb is virtually the same as

244
00:13:15,636 --> 00:13:20,235
the one that was set up in Beika Central Hospital 3 years ago,

245
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:23,135
so those two will somehow work something out.

246
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,036
Yes, I guess so.

247
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:28,035
As long as they don't lend an ear

248
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:30,836
to the voice of the devil, like 3 years ago...

249
00:13:34,536 --> 00:13:36,735
Let it down slowly.

250
00:13:36,736 --> 00:13:39,435
Easy now, easy.

251
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:41,736
All right...

252
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:46,035
Are you all right?

253
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:47,936
Okay, I got it!

254
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:51,235
Roger!

255
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:54,235
We've completed giving the equipment.

256
00:13:54,236 --> 00:13:55,535
Okay.

257
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:59,435
Okay, Officer Takagi, let's start.

258
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:00,735
Yes, sir.

259
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:02,335
You idiot!

260
00:14:02,336 --> 00:14:05,335
Shape up and stop panicking!

261
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:09,135
The one who's going to do the actual work is the boy that is with you!

262
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:12,135
If you get flustered, you may make the boy anxious

263
00:14:12,136 --> 00:14:13,935
and that may call for careless mistakes!

264
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,135
Yes, sir.

265
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:16,635
Don't worry.

266
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:18,835
If you take it easy and follow our instructions,

267
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:20,235
it'll finish in no time at all.

268
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:21,935
Calm down!

269
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:23,235
I understand.

270
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:25,635
Okay. First of all,

271
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:27,935
let's start by removing the photosensitive trigger device.

272
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:29,235
Yes, sir.

273
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:33,135
We will turn off the elevator lights in a minute from now,

274
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:35,536
so put on the infrared night scope.

275
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:42,635
When it gets dark, remove the mercury lever's right side cover.

276
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:45,335
Be careful not to touch the mercury lever.

277
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:48,935
First, we remove the cover, right?

278
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:52,036
Right. We'll turn off the lights now.

279
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:55,736
Did you get that, Conan?

280
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:00,935
Conan?

281
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:03,635
Here it is. The light sensitive tube.

282
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,236
If I cut the cord...

283
00:15:08,936 --> 00:15:11,335
What a relief.

284
00:15:11,336 --> 00:15:13,535
Conan, can you hear me?

285
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:16,635
Yes! I can hear you, so keep on going.

286
00:15:16,636 --> 00:15:18,635
Yeah.

287
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:20,035
Let's see.

288
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:23,535
If you take off the cover, you can see a lot of machines, right?

289
00:15:23,536 --> 00:15:27,335
Just above those machines, you should see a device that moves

290
00:15:27,336 --> 00:15:30,835
when it detects light called a light sensitive tube.

291
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:33,235
First of all, cut the cord

292
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:34,735
that is sticking out of the light sensitive tube.

293
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:36,836
Then, I turn this...

294
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:41,935
Electricity's flowing!

295
00:15:41,936 --> 00:15:44,035
Watch out, watch out.

296
00:15:44,036 --> 00:15:46,335
Okay, then. I'll place the plastic plate in this space

297
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:49,235
and use it as a stopper.

298
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:51,135
Stopper?

299
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:53,835
Come to think of it, that code...

300
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:57,636
"No use getting ready a good stopper", that's what it said.

301
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:02,736
Good stopper probably means earned run average.

302
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:08,135
But, why a major leaguer?

303
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:10,035
This is Japan.

304
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,436
He could've just written pro baseball player.

305
00:16:14,636 --> 00:16:16,335
Wait a sec.

306
00:16:16,336 --> 00:16:20,335
Extended game... earned run average...

307
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:23,336
Turn over... Major Leaguer...

308
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:27,736
Don't tell me that the other bomb is located at...

309
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:33,335
There's still a lot of time,

310
00:16:33,336 --> 00:16:35,736
but unless I figure out where it is...

311
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:41,435
Now listen, Conan.

312
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:43,235
When you're finished what you're doing, next...

313
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:46,035
Hey, Officer Takagi.

314
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:47,835
What is it, Conan?

315
00:16:47,836 --> 00:16:51,036
I have something I want to discuss with you.

316
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:57,235
Hey, what's going on?

317
00:16:57,236 --> 00:16:59,435
Now, it's the helicopters of the TV stations!

318
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,235
I wonder if something's happened after all.

319
00:17:02,236 --> 00:17:04,135
Hey!

320
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:05,136
Crap!

321
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:08,435
We're having a test now. Be quiet.

322
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:11,235
The time now is 11:40.

323
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:15,335
There is less than 20 minutes to go before the bomb is to go off.

324
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:19,135
The boy and the police officer who are trapped together with the bom

325
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:21,435
have not been rescued yet.

326
00:17:21,436 --> 00:17:23,735
Time is definitely ticking away.

327
00:17:23,736 --> 00:17:27,935
What will become of the boy and police officer?

328
00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:33,036
Will they perish together with the symbol of Tokyo?

329
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:37,835
What? He can't cut the cord?

330
00:17:37,836 --> 00:17:40,335
There are only three more left!

331
00:17:40,336 --> 00:17:44,335
First, the yellow cord to switch off the liquid crystal panel.

332
00:17:44,336 --> 00:17:47,635
Next, the white cord that is connected to the mercury lever.

333
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:50,335
And the black telephone cord that is set there

334
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,635
for remote control manipulation.

335
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:56,036
If you cut it in that order, the bomb will stop completely.

336
00:17:57,236 --> 00:18:00,435
How come you can't do that when you've already gone that far?

337
00:18:00,436 --> 00:18:01,635
Give me that!

338
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:03,435
Officer Takagi! Just what are you doing?

339
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:05,935
Hurry! Hurry and cut it!

340
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:08,735
No. We can't cut it.

341
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:12,135
What are you talking about? You've only got 10 minutes left.

342
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:14,635
"To the brave police officer."

343
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:15,935
What?

344
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:20,135
"In praise of your courage, we will give you a prize.

345
00:18:20,136 --> 00:18:24,435
A clue to another bigger firework will be displayed

346
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,035
at 3 seconds before the explosion.

347
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:30,435
With best wishes."

348
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:35,736
Conan says these are the words that are displayed on the LCD panel.

349
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:39,935
I would at least like to get Conan to evacuate somehow,

350
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:41,135
but in order to specify the other place where the bomb is set

351
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:42,535
and to avoid a large number of casualties,

352
00:18:42,536 --> 00:18:44,435
there seems to be no other choice

353
00:18:44,436 --> 00:18:46,835
than for Conan to look at the hint

354
00:18:46,836 --> 00:18:52,536
and for me to relay the location by phone.

355
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,036
I'm sorry.

356
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:00,035
Officer Takagi.

357
00:19:00,036 --> 00:19:04,636
But you understand, don't you?

358
00:19:07,536 --> 00:19:08,736
Stupid.

359
00:19:11,336 --> 00:19:12,835
4 minutes to go!

360
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:15,135
There's only 4 more minutes till the bomb goes off.

361
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:17,735
The timer has not been stopped yet.

362
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:20,435
Mr. Bomber. If you are watching this broadcast,

363
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:24,035
please stop the timer, please!

364
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:27,336
If you have a tinge of conscience left in you.

365
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,236
Heck with conscience...

366
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:37,435
I still can't believe that it's all working out so well.

367
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:39,935
Then, why don't you pick the broadcast of the TV on radio

368
00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:42,536
and listen to our heroic story?

369
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:48,635
The timer of the bomb is still moving.

370
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:51,235
-What? -Mr. Bomber, are you watching?

371
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:54,935
Don't tell me the remote control didn't work right!

372
00:19:54,936 --> 00:19:58,335
Let them be. We got the money already besides.

373
00:19:58,336 --> 00:20:02,035
I'm going to go tell the police how to...

374
00:20:02,036 --> 00:20:03,335
Hey!

375
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,035
Stop the bomb!

376
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:06,636
Hey! Wait!

377
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:19,135
The police...

378
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:23,335
Those cops took advantage of his conscience

379
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:25,636
and killed him.

380
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:29,935
I feel sorry for the brat.

381
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:31,635
But if the bomb goes off, the police will be blamed

382
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:33,335
for not being able to save the kid.

383
00:20:33,336 --> 00:20:35,935
If they go chicken and stop the bomb before it explodes,

384
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:39,536
they lose the hint and a greater number of casualties is inevitable.

385
00:20:42,636 --> 00:20:46,235
I'm going to make this public to the media

386
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:51,035
and colossal blunder of the police will be exposed in broad daylight.

387
00:20:51,036 --> 00:20:54,836
Either way, the cops are done for.

388
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:04,136
I see. That code had such a meaning.

389
00:21:06,136 --> 00:21:09,736
If you talk too loud, the bomber will hear us.

390
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,035
But there are more than 400 places in Tokyo

391
00:21:14,036 --> 00:21:16,535
that fit into that category.

392
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:23,135
Yes. It would be impossible to check all the places from now

393
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:24,936
without the bomber noticing.

394
00:21:26,336 --> 00:21:29,335
If we try to evacuate all the people

395
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:31,535
that are at the more than 400 locations...

396
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:33,535
Judging from the bomber's character,

397
00:21:33,536 --> 00:21:36,236
he will probably turn the switch on using remote control.

398
00:21:37,536 --> 00:21:41,135
In other words, to definitely save everybody...

399
00:21:41,136 --> 00:21:42,935
We've no other choice

400
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:45,435
but to look at the hint pinpoint the location

401
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:48,235
and look for the bomb.

402
00:21:48,236 --> 00:21:52,235
Just like Officer Matsuda did, right?

403
00:21:52,236 --> 00:21:53,735
Yes.

404
00:21:53,736 --> 00:21:55,135
And besides,

405
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:58,235
the person that I don't want to let die no matter what,

406
00:21:58,236 --> 00:22:01,736
one who is very precious to me may be there.

407
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:06,635
I'm sorry, Officer Takagi.

408
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:08,735
It's okay.

409
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:11,235
Hey, Conan.

410
00:22:11,236 --> 00:22:14,935
While you're at it, tell me one more thing, will you?

411
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:19,536
Who on earth are you?

412
00:22:21,936 --> 00:22:23,536
If you want to know...

413
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,836
I'll tell you...

414
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:35,835
In the world beyond.

415
00:22:35,836 --> 00:22:38,235
The two have not been rescued yet.

416
00:22:38,236 --> 00:22:40,035
There is only a minute left.

417
00:22:40,036 --> 00:22:41,635
The seconds are ticking away!

418
00:22:41,636 --> 00:22:44,335
Hey! What's going on?

419
00:22:44,336 --> 00:22:47,535
Conan and Officer Takagi are still inside!

420
00:22:47,536 --> 00:22:49,435
Oh, well...

421
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:51,335
It seems that the members of the riot task force

422
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,835
has also been ordered to evacuate!

423
00:22:52,836 --> 00:22:56,535
-What? -Take the car back to Toto Tower!

424
00:22:56,536 --> 00:22:58,235
Hey, it's dangerous, dangerous!

425
00:22:58,236 --> 00:23:00,235
Take the car back! Hey, Chiba!

426
00:23:00,236 --> 00:23:02,135
Take the car back! Take it back!

427
00:23:02,136 --> 00:23:04,435
They listened to it.

428
00:23:04,436 --> 00:23:07,936
The same words of the devil, as 3 years ago...

429
00:23:14,036 --> 00:23:16,535
But I know you guys, the Youth Detective Squad,

430
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:19,035
will be able to take care of things even if I'm not around, right?

431
00:23:19,036 --> 00:23:21,436
Conan!

432
00:23:23,336 --> 00:23:25,435
15 seconds to go.

433
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:27,935
Are you ready, Officer Takagi?

434
00:23:27,936 --> 00:23:29,235
Yeah.

435
00:23:29,236 --> 00:23:32,735
I wrote all your deductions in the mail.

436
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:35,435
All I have left to do now is to punch in the hint you're going to read

437
00:23:35,436 --> 00:23:36,836
and send it out.

438
00:23:38,236 --> 00:23:39,835
It's going to be coming out soon.

439
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:41,535
The first letter is...

440
00:23:41,536 --> 00:23:42,835
The letter...

441
00:23:42,836 --> 00:23:44,435
E...

442
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:45,935
V...

443
00:23:45,936 --> 00:23:47,435
I...

444
00:23:47,436 --> 00:23:48,436
T...

445
00:23:48,437 --> 00:23:50,636
No!

446
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:01,735
Get out of there...

447
00:24:01,736 --> 00:24:03,636
Get out of there, Ran!

448
00:24:05,636 --> 00:24:07,336
Shinichi?

449
00:24:09,636 --> 00:24:10,936
Ran!
