"First Prize 10 Million Yen"

3
00:00:20,242 --> 00:00:23,042
It's full of hot air balloons.

4
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:25,042
They're really beautiful.

5
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:28,442
This is the nation's greatest hot air balloon contest after all.

6
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:32,442
10 million yen will be awarded to the annual champion.

7
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:33,542
That's amazing.

"Reception" -Mr. Hasegawa.

10
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:40,642
Lady Sonoko, thanks for coming such a long way.

11
00:00:40,642 --> 00:00:42,642
I brought my friend along with me this year,

12
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,442
-I hope you don't mind. -Sure, it's okay.

13
00:00:45,442 --> 00:00:48,142
I'm Hasegawa, a member of the management board.

14
00:00:48,142 --> 00:00:51,642
The more people the better.

15
00:00:51,642 --> 00:00:55,642
How high can hot air balloons fly?

16
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:57,942
It depends on the size of the hot air balloon.

17
00:00:57,942 --> 00:01:02,242
But a big one can go higher than 10,000 meters.

18
00:01:02,242 --> 00:01:05,042
It'll fly easily over Mt. Fuji too.

19
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:07,642
Really? I'd like to ride one.

20
00:01:07,642 --> 00:01:10,442
I'm going to be riding to take a video,

21
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:11,842
so would you like to come with me?

22
00:01:11,842 --> 00:01:13,842
I'll go, I'll go!

23
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:17,442
Ran, Sonoko, come ride with us too!

24
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:19,342
But I don't want to be a bother.

25
00:01:19,342 --> 00:01:20,342
Yes, she's right.

26
00:01:20,342 --> 00:01:24,042
I'll bet you're just scared.

27
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,342
Hot air balloons are safe to ride,

28
00:01:26,342 --> 00:01:28,642
so you'll be completely okay.

29
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:31,242
It's a large as a seven story building,

30
00:01:31,242 --> 00:01:34,242
and there is a lot of light air inside it.

31
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:35,942
So even if a small hole were to open in it,

32
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:37,442
it won't descend right away.

33
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:41,342
See, even the person at headquarters is saying so too.

34
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:43,942
Is something wrong, Mr. Mizuguchi?

35
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:47,742
No, I was thinking of registering one more person.

36
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:51,342
I'd like to show my wife the scenery from above too.

37
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:54,742
Although he used to ask me, I always refused up to now

38
00:01:54,742 --> 00:01:57,442
but I've finally decided to try riding it.

39
00:01:57,442 --> 00:02:00,542
See, if you pass this chance up,

40
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:02,942
you'll probably never get to experience this ever again.

41
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:10,042
A canvas stained black with crime.

42
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:12,642
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

43
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:14,642
A gigantic colorful hot air balloon.

44
00:02:14,642 --> 00:02:16,742
Riding it brought about an unexpected turn of events!

45
00:02:16,742 --> 00:02:18,342
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:20,442
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:22,842
His name is Detective Conan!

"Mystery in a Hot Air Balloon"

49
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:12,141
I'm not really interested in hot air balloons.

50
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:14,441
What? Then, why did you say you were going to ride it?

51
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,341
He said that he is sure to win,

52
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:19,241
so for me to hold the championship trophy.

53
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:22,941
He also said that he'd buy a necklace for me with the award money.

54
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:24,641
So, I thought why not?

55
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:28,941
His salary is low and yet he does this hot air balloon thing

56
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:32,041
so he never bought me accessories.

57
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,041
I wonder what happened.

58
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,541
What're they doing? Stop it! Cut it out!

61
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,441
So what?

62
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:46,641
What?

63
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:48,241
Dear!

64
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:50,541
-Just what're you doing? Stop it! -Don't fight! Cut it out!

65
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,741
Stop it, please!

66
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:54,241
Arisa! But he...

67
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:57,841
Watch your mouth! You're the one who started the fight!

68
00:04:57,841 --> 00:04:59,841
Hot air balloons are more...

69
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,041
Easygoing things, I thought.

70
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,441
I guess not.

71
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:10,741
Mr. Mizuguchi said that he was the champion, right?

72
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:14,441
Yes. He was the annual champion for two successive years.

73
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:16,441
He's a very earnest person, you see.

74
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,041
Even last night after everyone left for the hotel,

75
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:22,041
he stayed behind making preparations.

76
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:26,741
See, that blue hot air balloon way back there is Mr. Mizuguchi's.

77
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:30,041
Please get ready to start.

00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,141
Fantastic!

81
00:05:54,141 --> 00:05:55,941
How beautiful.

82
00:05:57,641 --> 00:06:00,641
Hey, look!

83
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:03,241

You're right!

Hey, everyone's going ahead of us.

86
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,341
Don't you have to catch up with them?

87
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:53,241
Yes. It seems the wind is stronger above.

88
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:55,041
I'm going to adjust the burner

89
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,741
so will you take videos for me?

90
00:06:56,741 --> 00:06:58,441
What?

91
00:06:58,441 --> 00:06:59,641
What's the matter?

92
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:01,841
Nope. It's nothing.

93
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:08,041
Everybody's really speeding.

94
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,041
They're flying so close together. It looks dangerous.

95
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,541
Today's task is...

96
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:17,141
Task means the item of the event which is "Race to Area",

97
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:20,141
where you not only have to drop the marker on the target

98
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:22,041
but how fast you do it adds points.

99
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,641
That's why everybody's trying to make it to goal as fast as possible.

100
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:28,041
Hey, doesn't that look dangerous?

101
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,041
Where?

102
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,541
That blue balloon in the lead.

103
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,841
You mean the one with two people on it.

104
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:35,041
Isn't that Mr. Mizuguchi?

105
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:39,141
Watch out! They'll crash!

106
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:48,841
He opened the exhaust valve?

107
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:53,541
He's going to flee below!

108
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:02,841
They're falling!

109
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:05,741
Yes. But hot air balloons fall slowly,

110
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:07,841
so the people riding them should be okay.

111
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:25,941
Oh, Conan!

112
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:40,141
Arisa.

113
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:42,241
How could this happen?

114
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:49,641
Mr. Hasegawa, please call the police!

115
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:50,941
Yeah!

116
00:08:56,741 --> 00:08:58,741
I see.

117
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,541
"Lieutenant Kaneko (35)" -As far as I've heard till now,

118
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,541
"Ibaraki Prefectural Police" -this is totally an accident.

119
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,141
And where is the person who crashed the hot air balloon?

120
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:09,741
Mr. Okuda is still continuing the race.

121
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:13,441
I think it's about time that he reaches the goal though.

122
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:14,441
Although it may be an accident,

123
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:18,241
I'd like to know the details on how the woman fell.

124
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:24,441
I'm Kaneko from the Ibaraki Prefectural Police Department.

125
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:26,541
You're Mr. Shingo Mizuguchi?

126
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,241
I hate to ask you this at a time like this

127
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:35,041
but will you please give me the details of when you wife fell?

128
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:39,141
The hot air balloon came crashing into ours

129
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:41,141
and a hole opened in the fabric.

130
00:09:41,141 --> 00:09:42,141
Fabric?

131
00:09:42,141 --> 00:09:45,241
It's the part on top of the hot air balloon that looks like a balloon.

132
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:47,641
Oh. And?

133
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:51,641
Since the impact of the crash and the hole opened sideways,

134
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:56,241
the basket swayed, and although I told her to hang on tight...

135
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:57,741
But Arisa...

136
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:00,541
Chief.

137
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:04,041
We've finished, so is it okay for us to transport the corpse?

138
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,041
Yes.

139
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,541
Arisa.

140
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,641
Where are you taking her?

141
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,541
We may need to give her an autopsy

142
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,041
so she's being taken to the university hospital.

143
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,541
Please don't autopsy on her!

144
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,241
I can't bear you slicing up Arisa's body!

145
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:20,641
She's already wounded a lot as she is.

146
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:24,241
We know she died from the fall.

147
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:26,741
But, we can't say for sure

148
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:29,041
unless the medical examiner checks her over.

149
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:32,141
Arisa!

150
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:33,941
Please take me with you too.

151
00:10:33,941 --> 00:10:37,541
Yes, because you should also be treated for your wounds.

152
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,641
It was so pathetic that I just couldn't watch.

153
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:47,741
How dare he cause such an accident at our contest?

154
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:52,641
It may be an accident but I'll never forgive that guy Okuda!

155
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:01,441
What?

156
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:04,641
Arisa's hat?

157
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:08,341
Blood stains!

158
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:12,041
Come to think of it, Mr. Mizuguchi had wounds on his face.

159
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:18,841
What?

160
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:22,741
Vinyl? Could it be a part of something?

161
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:24,841
Conan!

162
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:27,241
Sonoko says she's going over to the goal.

163
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:28,641
I'll be right over!

164
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,041
Died?

165
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,241
Really?

166
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:53,541
That's why I've come here.

167
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,641
You really didn't know?

168
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:59,241
It's true! I was in the lead and flew all the way here.

169
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:01,741
How should I know about somebody who was behind me?

170
00:12:01,741 --> 00:12:05,141
You admit bumping into Mr. Mizuguchi's hot air balloon, then?

171
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,841
Yeah, but since it's a race.

172
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:11,341
We're all desperate to reach the goal as fast as possible.

173
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:14,041
This kind of thing happens frequently in races.

174
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,541
It may have been an accident,

175
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,441
but a person has died, you know.

176
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:20,641
You may be charged with corporate manslaughter.

177
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:22,341
No!

178
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:26,641
Sir, you were fighting with Mr. Mizuguchi before the race, weren't you?

179
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:29,541
-What? -What, is that true?

180
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,641
Watch your mouth, brat!

181
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:35,041
I would never lose to a guy like you!

182
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:38,441
How dare you! I'm a champion, you know!

183
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:41,341
It was his fault.

184
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:44,741
He had the nerve to say I'm too much of a greenhorn to beat him.

185
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:48,441
So you got angry and deliberately bumped into him?

186
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:50,741
I told you it wasn't deliberate!

187
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:54,241
And the basket of your hot air balloon is broken

188
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,541
and the rattan is sticking out.

189
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,841
You're right!

190
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:05,541
You tried to open a hole in Mr. Mizuguchi's hot air balloon

191
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,941
and drop it, didn't you?

192
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:09,941
This is not an accident

193
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:11,641
but a homicide!

194
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:27,571
And the perp is you, Mr. Okuda!

195
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:30,671
What? Don't be ridiculous!

196
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:32,671
When I checked my balloon yesterday,

197
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:35,171
no such thing was sticking out!

198
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:37,971
And besides, even if this were here,

199
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:39,871
if he didn't lower his altitude,

200
00:13:39,871 --> 00:13:43,271
the balloons would have just bumped into each other and that was it!

201
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:45,071
He's right.

202
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:46,671
Back then...

203
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:51,971
Mr. Mizuguchi opened the exhaust valve and lowered his altitude.

204
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:54,271
Why?

205
00:13:55,971 --> 00:14:00,271
Ran, you said, "What?" when we were flying.

206
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:02,671
Did you notice something strange?

207
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:04,271
Oh, that.

208
00:14:04,271 --> 00:14:05,671
It looked like there was only one person

209
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:08,671
in Mr. Mizuguchi's hot air balloon.

210
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:12,371
But, when I took another look later, two people were riding.

211
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:14,671
So I guess Arisa was bent down.

212
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:21,471
Hey, Mr. Hasegawa, can you please show me your camera?

213
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:22,671
Sure.

214
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:25,371
Thank you.

215
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,571
This is...

216
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:36,171
Maybe this is...

217
00:14:36,871 --> 00:14:40,371
At any rate, Mr. Okuda, please come to the police station with me!

218
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:43,871
Wait. I won today.

219
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:47,871
Please wait until after the awards are announced.

220
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:01,171
"Suzuki's Balloon Festival"

221
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:05,171
That's it for the report from forensics.

222
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,771
Good work.

223
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:09,671
Let me know if something comes up.

224
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:10,771
Yes, sir!

225
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:17,571
Mr. Mizuguchi.

226
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:22,871
Are you all right?

227
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:24,071
Yes.

228
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:27,371
I'm sorry for troubling everyone at this contest.

229
00:15:27,371 --> 00:15:30,471
It's not your fault, Mr. Mizuguchi.

230
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:37,371
Mr. Okuda.

231
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:39,871
As a result of the judges discussing this matter,

232
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:41,971
because of obstructing another,

233
00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:43,971
your win has been cancelled.

234
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:45,971
What? Obstructing another?

235
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:49,671
I was just desperately trying to win the race.

236
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:51,871
Please discuss it over again.

237
00:15:51,871 --> 00:15:54,671
The result will be the same no matter how many times we talk it over.

238
00:15:55,971 --> 00:16:01,171
So, Mr. Okuda, please come to the police station with me.

239
00:16:01,171 --> 00:16:02,571
No.

240
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,771
Hey, Sonoko.

241
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:13,971
What's the matter?

242
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:16,871
Please wait a while, will you, Officer?

243
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:18,871
Don't take him to the police station yet.

244
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:20,171
Why not?

245
00:16:20,171 --> 00:16:22,571
I'm telling you that the person that's going to be arrested is not him

246
00:16:22,571 --> 00:16:25,171
but someone else.

247
00:16:25,171 --> 00:16:28,071
Who are you talking about?

248
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:31,671
It's the pathetic husband of the victim.

249
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:35,471
Right, Mr. Shingo Mizuguchi?

250
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:40,871
Just what the heck are you talking about?

251
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:42,071
Mr. Hasegawa said that

252
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:46,071
yesterday night you stayed to tune your hot air balloon up

253
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,371
and was the last one to leave.

254
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:55,271
"Mizuguchi"

255
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:03,371
"Okuda"

256
00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:08,771
That's when you broke the basket of Mr. Okuda's hot air balloon

257
00:17:08,771 --> 00:17:11,171
and took out the rattan, correct?

258
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:17,671
Then you provoked Mr. Okuda before the race began

259
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:20,471
so that he would bump into you, didn't you?

260
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:21,671
If he didn't come at you,

261
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:24,371
I guess you were planning to bump into him from your side.

262
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:28,171
Why would I have to do something like that?

263
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:31,171
When Ran saw your hot air balloon in the air,

264
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:34,871
she said she thought she saw only one person in it.

265
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:36,471
But, when she looked the second time around,

266
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,171
she saw two people.

267
00:17:38,171 --> 00:17:41,471
Of course! There were two of us riding.

268
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:44,771
It's true, there were two of you riding.

269
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:49,571
But the person we saw while flying was not Arisa.

270
00:17:49,571 --> 00:17:50,571
At that time,

271
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:54,171
Arisa was made to sit at the bottom of the basket.

272
00:17:55,271 --> 00:17:58,071
When we saw your hot air balloon at the river bank,

273
00:17:58,071 --> 00:18:01,171
the bag that you put the rope that is needed for the people down here

274
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:04,771
to pull the hot air balloon along upon landing was there

275
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:08,771
but the other bag that you needed to put important things was missing.

276
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:13,371
And there were blood stains on the inside of the basket.

277
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:17,971
We thought at first that it were the stains of when you got hurt.

278
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:22,371
Those blood stains were probably those of your wife, Arisa.

279
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:24,571
True. According to the forensic officers,

280
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,171
it was the victim's blood.

281
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,071
In other words, when Arisa was riding the hot air balloon,

282
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:31,771
she was already hurt.

283
00:18:37,971 --> 00:18:40,871
When Mr. Okuda's hot air balloon hit yours,

284
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:44,871
you had your arm around Arisa's body, didn't you?

285
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:49,871
I was desperately trying to protect Arisa inside the unstable basket!

286
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:52,071
No, that's not it.

287
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:56,271
Watch out! They'll crash!

288
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:03,071
After you opened the exhaust valve and lowered the altitude,

289
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:05,571
you were desperately trying to hold Arisa

290
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:08,471
who was standing beside you from floating up.

291
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:10,971
Why? Because that was not Arisa

292
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:14,171
but a light doll that you had inflated by putting air into it.

293
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,471
And after you landed on the ground,

294
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:19,171
in order to get rid of the evidence,

295
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:21,871
you burned the doll together with the hot air balloon.

296
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:25,371
If you keep this up, I'm going to sue you for slander!

297
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:27,471
Listen, it was an accident!

298
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:31,371
Rather, if it were not an accident, Okuda's to blame for it!

299
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,371
What a poor loser.

300
00:19:34,371 --> 00:19:37,271
Now, let's get to the root of the matter.

301
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:40,271
You lowered the altitude of your hot air balloon

302
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:44,571
and when it was out of view from everyone, you...

303
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:52,071
Threw Arisa who was fainted out of the basket.

304
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:05,571
You killed Arisa who completely trusted you.

305
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:09,071
-Is it true? -You're not serious, are you?

306
00:20:09,071 --> 00:20:10,271
It's a lie!

307
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:12,171
It's all nonsense!

308
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:14,371
Where do you have such evidence?

309
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:19,871
Now, please!

310
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:33,771
Look at the burnt remains on the top part of the hot air balloon.

311
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:34,971
If you take a good look,

312
00:20:34,971 --> 00:20:38,871
there's a vinyl that looks like the hand of a doll, right?

313
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:42,671
And this too!

314
00:20:42,671 --> 00:20:47,371
It was on the ground about 300 meters from the starting point.

315
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,771
The content is a fire extinguisher.

316
00:20:49,771 --> 00:20:53,171
I think it'll match the wound on the back of Arisa's head.

317
00:20:57,771 --> 00:20:59,371
I couldn't help it.

318
00:21:00,571 --> 00:21:03,371
The stocks that I bought with the money a client entrusted me with

319
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:05,371
took a plunge.

320
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:07,171
And I had to return it as soon as possible

321
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:10,471
or next month is audit month.

322
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:14,371
That's why you were blinded by your wife's insurance money?

323
00:21:14,371 --> 00:21:17,271
It's too stupid to even get upset over it.

324
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:21,671
Just to think you would kill a person for money!

325
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:25,971
Go cool your head off behind bars.

326
00:21:25,971 --> 00:21:27,571
You inhuman jerk!

327
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:35,971
Mr. Mizuguchi, please come to the police station with me.

328
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:10,971
Just a expected of a Deduction Queen!

329
00:23:10,971 --> 00:23:15,071
Sonoko, you were awesome.

330
00:23:15,071 --> 00:23:16,771
You think so?

331
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:18,971
You're so good at deduction

332
00:23:18,971 --> 00:23:22,171
and yet I wonder why it doesn't apply to other things.

333
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:24,271
None of you business.

334
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:25,871
Besides, when you deduce,

335
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,771
why do you fall asleep like my dad?

336
00:23:29,571 --> 00:23:31,271
I wonder.

337
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:34,171
If it's an inherited trait, you're the one who should fall asleep.

338
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:36,871
It's not the genetic.

339
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:39,271
All Pops and Sonoko are doing is sleeping

340
00:23:39,271 --> 00:23:41,271
and not deducing.

341
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:45,471
It's the voice of Tengu (a long-nosed goblin).

342
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:48,971
How beautiful.

343
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:00,471
I wonder why it was swaying.

344
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:02,571
It could've been the wind.

345
00:24:05,071 --> 00:24:06,771
It's the voice of Tengu.

346
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:09,071
Next Conan,

347
00:24:09,071 --> 00:24:12,671
"Voice of Tengu (a long-nosed goblin)"
