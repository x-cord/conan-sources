There is a saying that

the stork brings new life and good fortune to homes

3
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:09,095
on which it stops to rest.

4
00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:14,795
And the small storks we just encountered

5
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:17,295
are no exception.

6
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:19,295

Located in Northern Hyogo Prefecture,

such as the Amanohashidate,

known as one of the "three representations of Japanese scenery".

Seeking the seven hot springs,

This feels good!

00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:20,917
This must be the foot bath!

29
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:24,217
This feels good!

30
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:26,417
Awesome, the weather is great too!

31
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:29,017
Can't wait to get to the open-air bath!

32
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:31,417
I didn't think much of hot springs,

33
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,217
but I think I'm starting to like it.

34

Excuse me.

35
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:37,617
Sorry! Can you move down just a bit?

36
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:39,517
My, we have nerves. I feel bad about it!

37
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:42,317
Pardon us!

38
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:44,117
It's because you're too fat!

39
00:02:44,117 --> 00:02:46,717
Look who's talking!

40
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:49,617
As I suspected, it's not all that good.

41
00:02:49,617 --> 00:02:52,217
Let's go to all the spas, okay?

42
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:55,217
I wonder where Genta and the others started from.

43
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:59,317

45
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:02,217
to be at the hot springs from early morning.

46
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:04,617
Indeed.

47
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:07,317
I got Mandara Spa!

48
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:10,417
Crab ice cream after the bath hits the spot.

Next, we're headed to Ichino Spa.

Genta!

51
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:16,917
You're dripping ice cream on your badge!

52
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:19,317
What a waste!

And here's the reason why.

56
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:30,117
This is the infamous Kouno Spa

Thanks, Uncle.

Does he think I'm a stork?

61
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:40,717
Don't you worry!

62
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:44,417
It was recommended by a client from a previous case that I solved!

63
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:49,117
Actually, I solved that.

64
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:52,517
Anyway, how did you sprain your ankle?

65
00:03:52,517 --> 00:03:54,417

I don't want to tell you about it!

73
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:22,917
I bet you weren't paying attention to where you were going.

74
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:24,817
Gotta pay, attention?

75
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:30,817
What the heck are you doing?

76
00:04:33,517 --> 00:04:34,917
Isn't that...

Wait, you two!

95
00:05:21,717 --> 00:05:24,817
Isn't this Ayumi's?

96
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:27,217
Ayumi!

97
00:05:27,217 --> 00:05:28,617
I guess I'll hold on to it!

98
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:36,517

This way.

Are you all right?

102
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,617
Are you hurt?

103

Don't touch me!

Aren't you with your mom and dad?

108
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:11,617
I'm not!

109
00:06:11,617 --> 00:06:13,617
Wait!

110
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:15,217
Haruna!

111

"Goshono Spa" -But, are you sure...

113
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:30,117
this will make publication?

114
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:31,417
Of course!

115
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:33,617
I'm gonna be following you throughout the day!

116
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:35,717
Well, have it your way then!

117
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:39,717
Beer is nice,

118
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:42,417
but Japanese sake with hot water from the hot spring is exceptional!

119
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:45,117
Great! Just keep at it!

120
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:47,217
Well, this is how an infamous detective

121

should be spending his vacation!

122
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,917
I got Ichino Spa!

123
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:54,417
-That's three. -Hey!

124
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:57,017
Ta-da! I got crab sticks!

125
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:01,117
I know you're just being your usual self,

126
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:03,517
but how much more are you going to eat, Genta?

127
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:06,017
I still have to get to the horse-beef steak!

128
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:07,017
Horse-beef?

129
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:09,417
You know, both horse meat and beef.

130
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:11,117
It's a local specialty.

131
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:14,717
"Horse Beef" -You mean...

132
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:17,817
-Tajima beef? -Huh?

133
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:20,917
It doesn't mean you can shorten it just because you can't read it!

134
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:24,117
What? It's not a combination of horse and beef?

135
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:26,817
I thought I was getting a good deal.

136
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:30,617
Genta ate a whole bunch for breakfast.

137
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,517
Huh? Where's Sister Ran?

138
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:36,017
Well... We've lost her a while ago.

139
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:37,717
Where could she be?

140
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:39,917
I just saw Sister Ran!

141
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:43,817
-Really? -Yes, I recall it was by the Yanagi Spa.

142
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:46,517
See.

143
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:49,717
The person in this photo is Ran, right?

144
00:07:49,717 --> 00:07:52,317
Who is that girl in the photo with her?

145
00:07:53,717 --> 00:07:56,517
Mitsuhiko, let me take a look at the left.

146
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,317
-Like this? -Yes.

147
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:01,117
This guy is...

148
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:02,617
This man...

149
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:05,117
-This guy ticked me off! -What?

150
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:08,217
He's the guy that bumped into Genta and didn't apologize!

151
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,917
Genta!

152
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:16,217
What the heck is his problem?

153
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:20,917
My crab ice cream!

154
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,917
That was only my second one!

155
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:26,417
Is that man following Ran and the girl?

156
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,717
Gotta call Sister Ran regardless.

157
00:08:30,517 --> 00:08:32,317
The phone you are trying to reach

158
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:36,417
is either out of the service area or turned off and...

159
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:37,917
What's up, what's up?

160
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,417
Are you guys talking about lunch?

161
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:43,617
-Sister Ran disappeared. -What?

162
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:45,617
She's not answering her phone either!

163
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:47,217
What's going on?

164
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:49,017
Things are getting interesting!

165
00:08:49,017 --> 00:08:51,517
Hey, the close-up is over!

166
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:53,317
What?

167
00:08:53,317 --> 00:08:55,917
But I've already informed the editor!

168
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:57,917
My daughter is missing.

169
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:59,717
I'm sorry, but this is it.

170
00:08:59,717 --> 00:09:02,817
-Can't you do something about it? -Don't be so pushy!

171
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:05,117
There goes my chance to make a breakthrough.

172
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:07,017
Darn it!

173
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:09,317
So, don't we have any clues

174
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:11,317
that'll leads us to Ran's whereabouts?

175
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,717
Well...

176
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:16,317
If I only knew who that girl is...

177
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:20,117
What's wrong? Walking on crutches...

178
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:22,517
Did you fall down and twist your ankle?

179
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:23,617
Hattori!

180
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:25,517
I mean, Brother Heiji?

181
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:27,817
What a coincidence to see you here.

182
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,717
Where's Ran?

183
00:09:29,717 --> 00:09:32,117
Ran disappeared!

184
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:33,717
-What? -Disappeared?

185
00:09:33,717 --> 00:09:37,917
Yes, she is supposedly with this girl.

186
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,217
Girl?

187
00:09:39,217 --> 00:09:41,417
Wait a minute! This girl...

188
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:43,517
You know her?

189
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,517
Sure I know her.

190
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:49,317
We're here to find that kid.

191
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:51,817
Haruna Tabuse, 8 years old.

192
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:55,217
The only daughter of the president of a famous restaurant franchise.

193
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:57,217
She's been missing since yesterday.

194
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:59,617
-What? -Missing?

195
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:02,717
Mr. Tabuse!

196
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:04,917
Sorry to keep you waiting.

197
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:05,917
Hattori!

198
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:07,117
"Shuhei Tabuse (42)" -Where's Haruna?

199
00:10:07,117 --> 00:10:09,317
Did you find my daughter Haruna?

200
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:13,217
Not yet, but we have a solid clue.

201
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:15,117
Really?

202
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:17,817
By the way, who's this?

203
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,917
He's a detective from Tokyo.

204
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:21,817
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

205
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:23,717
Mouri... The...

206
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:26,117
The infamous detective?

207
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:28,017
Huh?

208
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:30,017
What is that stain?

209
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:32,417
And this little one is...

210
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:34,317
I'm Conan Edogawa!

211
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:36,117
"Little" was so unnecessary.

212
00:10:37,117 --> 00:10:39,517
Man, why are you following us?

213
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:41,117
Stay out of this, little brat!

214
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:44,217
Well, I'm worried about Sister Ran!

215
00:10:44,217 --> 00:10:45,817
Sister Ran?

216
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:51,817
Actually, it looks like your daughter is with our daughter Ran.

217
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,617
Your daughter kidnapped Haruna?

218
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:56,217
Say something!

219
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:57,917
Now, now...

220
00:10:57,917 --> 00:10:59,117
"Kinosaki Base Spring."

221
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,817
Meat bun made from Tajima beef.

222
00:11:05,617 --> 00:11:07,117
So good!

223
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:10,817
The Tajima meat bun is tasty!

224
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:12,717
This crab bun looks delicious, too!

225
00:11:12,717 --> 00:11:16,717
Hey! Stop! I'm not your wallet!

226
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:20,417
Come on, treat me a bit.

227
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:22,117
By a "bit", you mean

228
00:11:22,117 --> 00:11:24,417
ten hot spring eggs, five pork buns,

229
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,817
and four beef buns?

230
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:29,417
That's not fair! Conan took off without us.

231
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:33,517
I guess something really happened to Ran?

232
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:37,317
At least Edogawa seems to think so.

233
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:41,917
Then, let's find Sister Ran before Conan does!

234
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:45,217
I agree! That's the way the Youth Detectives roll!

235
00:11:45,217 --> 00:11:47,717
There wouldn't be a problem if we can do that.

236
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:50,917
Our only clue is that photo.

237
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:53,017
Right.

238
00:11:53,017 --> 00:11:54,917
This backpack!

239
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:57,917
It's the same one that I wanted!

240
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,617
The same?

241
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:02,517
See, on this brochure...

242
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:04,317
Isn't this the backpack?

243
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:09,017
I'm so sorry. I lost my temper.

244
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:11,917
Please, don't worry about it.

245
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:14,617
Mr. Tabuse. If it's okay with you,

246
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:16,817
can you tell us what happened from the beginning?

247
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:18,317
Sure.

248
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:21,217
It all started yesterday.

249
00:12:21,217 --> 00:12:23,317
An exhibition piece was stolen yesterday

250
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:26,717
from the Tabuse Museum in Kobe.

251
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:31,017
It happened while we were rearranging the exhibition.

252
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,917
And around the same time,

253
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:39,417
my daughter Haruna who was visiting the museum also disappeared.

254
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:41,917
I was here in Kinosaki for business,

255
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:44,317
"Kamachi Takeshi (45)" -received word from Director Kamachi,

256
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:45,817
then with the help of my colleague,

257
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:48,717
I requested Hattori to search for my daughter.

258
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:51,817
So, what was the stolen piece?

259
00:12:51,817 --> 00:12:53,817
It was a piece called "The Rainbow's Child"

260
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:56,817
by a sculptor named Kaho Handa.

261
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,317
Let's see.

262
00:13:00,217 --> 00:13:03,917
So this is the sculpture of "The Rainbow's Child".

263
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,917
So that means, when this sculpture was stolen,

264
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:11,117
Haruna just happened to be there and was kidnapped.

265
00:13:11,117 --> 00:13:14,317
Where could Haruna be?

266
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:17,417
By the way, what about the clue?

267
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:21,917
In fact, it looks like Haruna is here in Kinosaki.

268
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:24,717
In Kinosaki?

269
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:25,917
This is...

270
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:29,817
It's Haruna! No doubt about it!

271
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:32,217
Who is that man in the corner?

272
00:13:32,217 --> 00:13:34,317
We don't have proof,

273
00:13:34,317 --> 00:13:36,317
but we suspect he's probably the kidnapper!

274
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:39,517
So it seems like your daughter ran away from the kidnapper,

275
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:40,817
bumped into Ran,

276
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:43,517
and they're on the run together!

277
00:13:43,517 --> 00:13:47,817
Ran. Why aren't you contacting us at all?

278
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:49,417
Could it be...

279
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:52,617
The man already...

280
00:13:56,718 --> 00:13:58,018
"Toyooka Caban Street."

281
00:13:58,018 --> 00:14:00,518
Toyooka means bags!

282
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:03,518
Look, a bag vending machine!

283
00:14:03,518 --> 00:14:04,918
What a rare sight!

284
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:06,618
Gotta buy one! Gotta buy it!

285
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:08,818
The stork design looks nice!

286
00:14:08,818 --> 00:14:11,218
Hey, why don't you buy one too?

287
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:12,818
Hey, let me go!

288
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:22,218
Excuse me.

289
00:14:22,218 --> 00:14:25,118
-Awesome! -It's full of bags!

290
00:14:25,118 --> 00:14:27,518
We're looking for a girl.

291
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:32,118
Was there a girl who ordered the same bag like that one over there?

292
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:33,718
Can you hang on for a minute?

293
00:14:33,718 --> 00:14:35,818
Go ahead, please listen to them.

294
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:37,918
I'll be alright.

295
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,418
I apologize.

296
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:42,418
-By "backpack", you mean this one? -Yes.

297
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:46,518
If it is, the most recent one was for Mr. Tabuse's Haruna.

298
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,418
It was a pink backpack!

299
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:50,518
Then, I'm pretty sure.

300
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:52,318
Um...

301
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:55,018
"Iruka Yui (23), Dolphin Trainer" -Are you guys Haruna's friends?

302
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:57,118
Something happen to Haruna?

303
00:14:57,618 --> 00:15:00,218
-Kinosaki Marine World? -Yes.

304
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:03,118
The dolphin trainer who knows Haruna

305
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:06,218
called her colleague on a hunch,

306
00:15:06,218 --> 00:15:08,318
then they told her that they saw the two that fit the description.

307
00:15:08,318 --> 00:15:09,418
Really?

308
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:12,818
I'll give you a call when I find out more.

309
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:15,518
Hey! I'll be there too...

310
00:15:15,518 --> 00:15:17,318
Hold on!

311
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:20,618
There are still things that need to be investigated in this city.

312
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:22,918
I'll move for you!

313
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:26,518
You just sit tight and tell us what we need to do!

314
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:28,818
Hattori...

315
00:15:28,818 --> 00:15:30,018
I appreciate it.

316
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:33,018
By the way, what happened to your leg?

317
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:36,518
You weren't paying too much attention to that girl, were you?

318
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,718
No way!

319
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:41,818
"Kinosaki Marine World."

320
00:15:49,718 --> 00:15:50,818
Awesome!

321
00:15:50,818 --> 00:15:52,518
Yui, you're cool!

322
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:56,418
This is Genta, the sea lion!

323
00:15:58,218 --> 00:15:59,718
Check it out! His name is Genta!

324
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:01,118
It's huge!

325
00:16:01,118 --> 00:16:03,718
Looks just like you. You two brothers?

326
00:16:03,718 --> 00:16:05,218
How is that possible!

327
00:16:05,218 --> 00:16:08,918
We're not here to have fun.

328
00:16:20,518 --> 00:16:23,618
She was also doing the same at that bag store.

329
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,918
Have you seen this child?

330
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:29,618
I'm looking for this child.

331
00:16:29,618 --> 00:16:31,918
I've seen this child.

332
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:36,918
There. They were visiting the Kishimojin.

333
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:39,518
Was searching for something?

334
00:16:39,518 --> 00:16:43,118
Yeah, while going around the spas

335
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:44,418
and the usual tourist spots.

336
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:48,118
And, have you heard of the Legend of Kishimojin?

337
00:16:48,118 --> 00:16:50,418
"The Legend of Kishimojin"?

338
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:52,918
I think...

339
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:56,918
In ancient India, there was a demon with a thousand children,

340
00:16:56,918 --> 00:17:00,118
feared for eating human children.

341
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:05,018
One day, Shakyamuni Buddha hid the demon's youngest child.

342
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:07,618
Buddha taught the mourning demon a lesson

343
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:11,618
on how the parents suffered the loss of their children.

344
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:14,118
From that point on,

345
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:16,418
the reformed demon became the God of easy delivery

346
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:19,018
and the protector of children, the Kishimojin.

347
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:23,318
They were also searching for something around the Kishimojin shrine.

348
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:26,818
Are they really being chased?

349
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:28,718
Seems to me like.

350
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:31,318
Ran is being dragged around on a kid's sightseeing tour.

351
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,518
Yeah, I recognize her.

352
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:37,518
It's probably the family in this photo.

353
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:39,818
This photo is from three years ago.

354
00:17:39,818 --> 00:17:44,918
Haruna Tabuse. Her father, Shuuhei, her mother, Kaho.

355
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:48,518
Kaho? If I'm not mistaken, Kaho is...

356
00:17:48,518 --> 00:17:51,218
The sculptor of "The Rainbow's Child",

357
00:17:51,218 --> 00:17:54,518
Handa Kaho is your ex-wife

358
00:17:54,518 --> 00:17:57,218
and also Haruna's mother.

359
00:17:57,218 --> 00:17:59,018
Why didn't you tell us?

360
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:02,718
That's a first for me too, Mr. Tabuse.

361
00:18:02,718 --> 00:18:05,218
I wasn't trying to hide the fact.

362
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:08,018
Where is Kaho now?

363
00:18:10,118 --> 00:18:12,718
That woman is...

364
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:16,018
That woman is a demon who took art over her own daughter!

365
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:18,618
I don't know where she is! I don't even want to know!

366
00:18:18,618 --> 00:18:21,318
Mr. Tabuse.

367
00:18:21,318 --> 00:18:24,318
But why did you exhibit

368
00:18:24,318 --> 00:18:26,118
the piece of a person whom you won't forgive?

369
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:29,418
That is...

370
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:32,218
-I got it! That woman did it! -What?

371
00:18:33,318 --> 00:18:36,418
That woman stole "The Rainbow's Child"!

372
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:39,318
Or, she made Haruna take it.

373
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,018
That's what happened!

374
00:18:42,018 --> 00:18:46,718
So, does that mean that suspicious person is Kaho in disguise?

375
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:50,918
I think that's a bit premature.

376
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:53,418
That thing, Kabachi.

377
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:55,218
All right.

378
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:58,818
A letter from Kaho addressed to Ms. Haruna.

379
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:01,418
It was found by and acquired from the President.

380
00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:02,918
Excuse me.

381
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:05,018
May I take a look?

382
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,118
Sure.

383
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:10,918
Let's see. "Kinosaki Springs and the Marine World.

384
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:13,118
That was fun, wasn't it?

385
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,418
Sure, you were still small,

386
00:19:15,418 --> 00:19:17,418
so you might not remember much."

387
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:18,518
It's the same!

388
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:21,718
The spas, play ground, and Kiyamachi Square.

389
00:19:21,718 --> 00:19:24,518
Haruna's appeared in all the locations mentioned in this letter!

390
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:30,018
So, Haruna is revisiting the locations they had visited in the past!

391
00:19:30,018 --> 00:19:32,818
That woman is waiting for Haruna

392
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:34,918
and "The Rainbow's Child" at one of those locations.

393
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:38,418
No. Then, they'll just need to specify a location.

394
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:41,418
This is irritating me.

395
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:43,818
-That's strange. -What's strange?

396
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:45,618
Haruna also stopped by

397
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:49,418
the Kinosaki Straw Crafting Tradition Hall

398
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:51,918
that's not mentioned in the letter.

399
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:53,718
On the other hand, they didn't stop by

400
00:19:53,718 --> 00:19:57,018
the Kinosaki Art and Literature Hall that's in the letter.

401
00:19:57,018 --> 00:20:00,018
Let me see!

402
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:03,918
"I unexpectedly saw my friend, Michiko's straw craft

403
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:06,618
at the Kinosaki Art and Literature Hall and..."

404
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:08,418
Who's Michiko?

405
00:20:08,418 --> 00:20:10,618
Kaho's high school classmate

406
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:12,518
and a straw crafting artist.

407
00:20:12,518 --> 00:20:16,418
But, how come Haruna went to where she's never been?

408
00:20:16,418 --> 00:20:18,918
The memory is from three years ago, when she was five years old.

409
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,718
She probably doesn't remember.

410
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:22,718
Is that so?

411
00:20:22,718 --> 00:20:25,418
Something doesn't feel right.

412
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:27,218
What's this?

413
00:20:27,218 --> 00:20:31,118
"I'll keep it with the memory of our trip."

414
00:20:31,118 --> 00:20:34,818
Hey, hey. What is the "it" mentioned here in the letter?

415
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:37,118
I don't know.

416
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:40,918
More important is where the daughter is headed next.

417
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:46,518
That is probably Kinosaki Springs Station mentioned in the letter!

418
00:20:54,318 --> 00:20:58,918
"Jibo Kannon Statue."

419
00:20:59,918 --> 00:21:02,418
Yes! Maybe it's here!

420
00:21:02,418 --> 00:21:06,718
Hey, Haruna. What have you been looking for?

421
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:08,018
Hey!

422
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:13,418
Where is it? Where is it?

423
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,918
Let me go!

424
00:21:19,918 --> 00:21:21,418
Haruna!

425
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:25,118
Let go of her!

426
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,618
Don't move!

427
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:30,118
Haruna!

428
00:21:32,318 --> 00:21:33,618
Where did you put it?

429
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:35,618
-I don't know! -Stop right there!

430
00:21:38,418 --> 00:21:41,018
Haruna! Contact the police, now!

431
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:49,918
Miss!

432
00:23:21,918 --> 00:23:23,918
"Next Episode" -Sorry, Ran.

433
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:26,518
If I could only move the way I wanted to...

434
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:29,318
Bingo! Haruna's making a move!

435
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:33,018
Finally, this is more like the Youth Detectives!

436
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:35,218
The sound of drums coming from the badge?

437
00:23:35,218 --> 00:23:39,218
Seems like you're thoughts are the same as mine, Kudou.

438
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:43,318
Somebody... Somebody help!

439
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:46,118
Ran, wait for me!

440
00:23:46,118 --> 00:23:54,818
Next Conan, "Stork Mystery Tour (Pursuing Haruna)"

441
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:08,547
Next Conan's Hint:

442
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,147
"The Detectives Badge."

443
00:24:11,147 --> 00:24:13,847
Got it, this badge will solve the case for sure!

444
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:15,747
Genta, it's cold and it means delicious crabs.
