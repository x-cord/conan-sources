1
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:08,925
Rum.

2
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:12,625
Just as I deduced.

3
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:16,225
The perp who killed Koji Haneda 17 years ago

4
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:20,625
is the bodyguard who disappeared from the scene of the crime called Asaka.

5
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,525
His identity is

6
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:27,625
thought to be the number 2 man of the Black Organization, Rum.

7
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:31,225
Even if he were to have left a dying message

8
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:34,525
just before he died, saying so

9
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:38,125
I can't get a hold of any further information.

10
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:42,025
In the first place, is Asaka a last name or first name?

11
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:45,525
If it's a last name, I can't even make out the gender.

12
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:50,925
What drug was Koji Haneda forced to drink, anyway?

13
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,125
It seems to have been a drug that Ai's parents made,

14
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,825
but Ai who revived the drug said

15
00:00:56,825 --> 00:01:00,525
she had no intention of making a poison drug.

16
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:06,225
Besides, when Gin forced me to drink that drug, he mumbled.

17
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,125
We'll use this.

18
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:14,625
This drug was recently developed by the Organization.

19
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:18,625
They won't be able to find any traces of poison in the body.

20
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:21,925
It allows you to commit the perfect crime.

21
00:01:21,925 --> 00:01:24,325
It seems to be a prototype

22
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:26,025
that has never been used on humans yet though.

23
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,925
Which means that the drug that I was made to drink back then

24
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,225
was the drug Ai had revived,

25
00:01:33,225 --> 00:01:35,925
and I was the first one they tried it on.

26
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:40,025
-I'm home. -Huh? A talk show?

27
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:42,925
With another detective?

28
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:45,925
Spirit Detective Gaito Hotta?

29
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:48,325
There was somebody like that before.

30
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:50,625
A suspicious guy with that kind of name.

31
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:54,325
Anyway, more information needs to be gathered.

32
00:01:54,325 --> 00:01:56,925
The site of that case hasn't been uploaded for a while

33
00:01:56,925 --> 00:01:58,925
after it's been deleted either.

34
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:02,325
Huh? Solve the mystery

35
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:04,625
and disclose the truth of the Koji Haneda murder case?

36
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,025
The Koji Haneda murder case is the one

37
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:11,625
that happened 17 years ago in the States or wherever,

38
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,925
the cold case, right?

39
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:19,325
Huh? Summon the spirit of Koji Haneda?

40
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:23,125
I can't be wasting time on a stupid program like that!

41
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:27,325
What? It's just a corner of a late night program this time,

42
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:30,525
but if the ratings are good, it'll be moved to golden time

43
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,525
and my name will appear as the title of the program?

44
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:34,225
Furthermore, for the MC,

45
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:37,125
you have plans to call Yoko Okino?

46
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,125
Huh? Tomorrow morning at the restaurant of the hotel

47
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,825
you'll be explaining the arrangement?

48
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:45,925
Okay! Okay!

49
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:48,225
And what about the pay?

50
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:02,625
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

51
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,825
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

52
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:06,925
The information on Rum becomes eerily effective.

53
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:08,925
What is the spirit detective going to say?

54
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:10,725
He sees through the one and only truth.

55
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:13,025
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

56
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:15,425
His name is Detective Conan!

57
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:50,595
"The Spirit Detective's Murder (Part 1)"

58
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:56,441
Gosh. How come you're tagging along?

59
00:04:56,441 --> 00:05:01,141
Because Ran's out overnight because of Karate training camp and not home.

60
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:04,641
It's not fair that only you get to eat at a restaurant, Pops!

61
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:07,941
Well, it seems the TV station's going to be paying for the meal

62
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,841
but don't order something too expensive, understand?

63
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:16,241
Moreover, I want to meet the spirit detective too, you see!

64
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:21,041
That spirit detective Gaito Hotta summons the spirit of the dead

65
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,441
and blurts out things accurately

66
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:25,741
that only people intimate to the spirit knows, right?

67
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:26,741
Yeah.

68
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:28,641
There were a time when the bones of a missing person

69
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:31,741
was found in the mountains, too.

70
00:05:31,741 --> 00:05:33,841
That was just a coincidence.

71
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:36,941
I hear that the bones were of a totally different person.

72
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:39,041
Besides, he was correct in many things

73
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,941
only because he made investigations beforehand.

74
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,241
The fact that he paid for witnesses

75
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:47,641
to give falsified testimony of missing persons was brought to light

76
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:51,541
and he was razzed by the media, then disappeared.

77
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:55,441
But it's amazing how he made it back to television.

78
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:59,141
Even though he appears with a new trick to deceive people,

79
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:02,541
I, the Sleeping Kogoro will see right through it.

80
00:06:05,141 --> 00:06:06,641
That's right.

81
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:09,841
If a guy like that is deliberately going to summon

82
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:13,641
the spirits of famous people who crossed over in the past,

83
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,241
it could be that he has information

84
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:19,841
that no one else has gotten hold of yet.

85
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:23,041
I'll disclose what he's doing at all costs.

86
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,441
I'll get to the true identity of Rum.

87
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:35,141
Mr. Mouri!

88
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:38,241
Well, sorry to have kept you waiting.

89
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:40,541
I'm sorry you had to come so early in the morning.

90
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,541
No, no problem.

91
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,141
So, you're Conan, right?

92
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:46,641
How do you do?

93
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:49,741
I've heard about you. You're the Kid Killer, right?

94
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:54,041
If it's okay with you, I'd like to hear some comments from you too, okay?

95
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,241
Yep!

96
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:58,541
Okay, shall we make the arrangements over breakfast?

97
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:02,141
Before that, let me take you to the room where Mr. Hotta is staying.

98
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:03,341
What?

99
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:06,741
It seems that he wants you to watch him summon the spirits first.

100
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:08,741
All right.

101
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:11,041
Okay, let's go then.

102
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:18,141
Well, I'm sure glad you brought Conan along with you.

103
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:19,541
What?

104
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,541
Although the part where he summons the spirits may be a bit dubious,

105
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,241
we can take pictures of him being surprised, you see.

106
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:26,641
I see.

107
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:29,441
It's hard to believe that this kid'll be surprised, though.

108
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:36,541
Huh? This is strange.

109
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,241
He's supposed to be in his room.

110
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:43,041
Maybe this morning when I confirmed the time by email,

111
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:47,641
he wrote that he would be meeting someone before the arrangement,

112
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:51,041
so maybe that someone is still with him in the room.

113
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:55,241
Huh? Mr. Hotta mailed me an hour ago.

114
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,741
What?

115
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:58,841
"I'm going to be killed. Help me!"

116
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:01,041
Hey, hey. Are you serious?

117
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:05,441
Anyway, I'll go get the bellboy and have him unlock the door.

118
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:08,441
Mr. Mouri, please keep on the lookout

119
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:10,141
so that no one suspicious comes out of the room.

120
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:11,741
Yeah.

121
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,941
Don't tell me that this is part of the performance, too?

122
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,841
Jeez. What's taking him so long?

123
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:24,941
What is that director doing?

124
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:26,241
There they are!

125
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:29,641
I'm sorry. It took me a while to explain.

126
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,141
Mr. Hotta?

127
00:08:34,141 --> 00:08:36,241
Mr. Hotta, are you in?

128
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:39,141
Never mind, just hurry and use the key!

129
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:42,241
All right. I will...

130
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:44,141
Wait!

131
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:46,041
An incoming call.

132
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,941
Hello, Mr. Hotta?

133
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:49,941
Are you Mr. Hotta?

134
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:52,941
I'm sorry. It was a wrong number.

135
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:54,641
I'll open the door then.

136
00:08:54,641 --> 00:08:55,941
Okay.

137
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,241
Mr. Hotta?

138
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,941
What was that sound?

139
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:04,941
It sounded like something cracking.

140
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:15,041
A wine glass and plate.

141
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:19,141
It seems that someone had been drinking wine here till just a while ago.

142
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,441
And that someone, surprised that we came in,

143
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:25,041
dropped the plate and glass cup,

144
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,241
stepped on the spilt wine and went into the room beyond.

145
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,441
Somebody fled from the veranda just now!

146
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:48,341
But this is the 4th floor, you know?

147
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:51,641
No, I'm certain I saw a silhouette of a person.

148
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:56,241
I'll bet he fled to the next room from the veranda!

149
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:59,541
The slippers with the wine stains on them are left here, too.

150
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,841
No mistake about it!

151
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:04,341
Hey, Bellboy!

152
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:06,241
Yes, sir.

153
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:08,841
Is there someone staying in the room next door?

154
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:12,041
Yes, room 403?

155
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,941
A boy who looks to be in high school

156
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:16,141
has been staying there since a week ago.

157
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:21,041
Huh? A kid is staying alone for a week in a hotel by himself?

158
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,841
More important,

159
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:25,641
what's this sound that I've been hearing from a while ago?

160
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:28,341
It's the sound of the renovation construction that's going on downstairs!

161
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:30,441
Since it's noisy and shakes a bit,

162
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:33,641
the rooms in this area are a bit cheaper, you see.

163
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:35,241
I see.

164
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:39,341
And? Where is Gaito Hotta, the man in question?

165
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:41,241
In bed, maybe?

166
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,041
Because there's a small mound there.

167
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:50,641
But it hasn't budged an inch since a while ago.

168
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:52,141
So he's probably already...

169
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,271
Gosh. What a cruel thing to do.

170
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:17,171
Mr. Hotta.

171
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:19,071
-Mr. Hotta! -No, you don't!

172
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:20,771
Don't dare touch the corpse!

173
00:11:20,771 --> 00:11:21,871
Okay.

174
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:25,671
I'll return to the front desk and contact the police.

175
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:29,171
No. You stay here with Mr. Kokuri.

176
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:31,071
So, call the police from here!

177
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:33,671
Because if the perp should come back here from that window,

178
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:37,171
you may not be able to nab him alone.

179
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:39,371
Nab him?

180
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:41,371
Where are you going, Mr. Mouri?

181
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:43,571
I'm going to the room next door.

182
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:48,171
That boy that's staying there may already be dead, though.

183
00:11:53,971 --> 00:11:56,571
Gosh! There's no answer.

184
00:11:56,571 --> 00:11:58,771
So, the perp's already...

185
00:11:58,771 --> 00:12:01,271
Gosh, who is it?

186
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:04,171
What's with all the noise?

187
00:12:04,171 --> 00:12:06,071
You're...

188
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:11,271
Huh? You're the guy from the detective agency.

189
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:14,971
Masumi Sera.

190
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:17,071
You're here too, Conan.

191
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:21,671
Hey, never mind that. Didn't anyone come to this room?

192
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:23,471
Nobody came.

193
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:24,871
Are you sure?

194
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:26,571
I'm sure.

195
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:29,271
I'm the only one in this room.

196
00:12:32,971 --> 00:12:35,071
I see.

197
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:36,971
So, this is how it is?

198
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:39,771
You came to room 402 that's next to this room

199
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:41,971
to meet with the spirit detective

200
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:46,271
along with the TV director Kokuri, but...

201
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:48,371
The minute you opened the door of the room,

202
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:51,671
you heard the sound of wine glasses

203
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:57,271
and plates fall and crack.

204
00:12:57,271 --> 00:12:58,671
So you ran inside,

205
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:01,171
you found that someone had stepped on the split wine.

206
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:02,871
The traces of that wine lead into the bedroom beyond,

207
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:04,471
so you opened that door and went inside.

208
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:05,971
The window was opened

209
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:09,171
and you saw someone run out to the veranda!

210
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:15,871
And that veranda is next to the veranda of room 403 here.

211
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:19,971
You figured that somebody ran along the veranda

212
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:23,271
and jumped over the railing then fled into my room.

213
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:24,871
Amidst all this,

214
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:28,971
you realized that a small mound was created on the bed.

215
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:31,371
So, you flipped the covers open...

216
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:35,071
And found what you did.

217
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:37,171
Yep! That's why we were wondering

218
00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:41,171
if somebody suspicious came into your room.

219
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:43,271
I said I'm the only one here.

220
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:47,471
But on the veranda of the room next door,

221
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:51,171
wine stained slippers were found left behind.

222
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:52,671
This is the 4th floor,

223
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:55,371
so your room is the only place the perp can flee into.

224
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:58,071
Anyway, let me check inside your room!

225
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:01,171
The perp may have snuck in and is hiding right now, you know.

226
00:14:01,171 --> 00:14:03,971
I'm telling you that there's no one here, aren't I?

227
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:07,771
More importantly, don't you have any idea about the perp?

228
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:11,171
It seems that the victim was meeting with someone before meeting me.

229
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:13,671
I'm sure that person is the perp.

230
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:18,071
I think it involves somebody from the case 17 years ago.

231
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:19,271
It seems that Gaito Hotta was saying

232
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:21,171
he was going to summon the spirit of Koji Haneda

233
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:25,171
who was killed in that case, you see.

234
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:27,171
Haneda...

235
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:28,271
Koji!

236
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:31,971
And? Did you hear something about the case from that detective?

237
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,571
No. It was before I met him, so...

238
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:37,671
What? Do you know that guy called Haneda?

239
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:42,371
Yeah. He was a Shogi player.

240
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,871
Well, if you want to help out with the case,

241
00:14:44,871 --> 00:14:46,871
let me check your room!

242
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:48,171
Because they're going to check this place out

243
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:50,371
when the police get here anyway.

244
00:14:50,371 --> 00:14:52,271
Okay.

245
00:14:52,271 --> 00:14:54,971
I've got my undies and stuff lying all around

246
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:56,971
so give me a minute, okay?

247
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:01,371
Gosh.

248
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:04,771
How long is she going to take just to put her undies away?

249
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,871
Excuse me.

250
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:09,671
I just got a call from the front desk that we got a complaint

251
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:13,571
saying that a car is parked in a place that's not the parking lot.

252
00:15:13,571 --> 00:15:16,471
Could the car be either one of yours?

253
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:18,871
That's my car!

254
00:15:18,871 --> 00:15:22,471
I'm sorry. The parking lot was full, you see.

255
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:25,971
I was thinking of parking it somewhere else later but forgot to!

256
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:28,771
I'll move it right away.

257
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:33,671
Thanks for waiting!

258
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:35,671
Hey, wait...

259
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:37,371
The best place to hide on the spur of the moment would be...

260
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,671
would be the veranda!

261
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:45,471
But there's nobody here, after all.

262
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:50,071
The wine stained slippers were found

263
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:52,071
on the veranda next door, which means...

264
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:55,371
the perp had no choice but to jump over here.

265
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,371
But since this is the 4th floor,

266
00:15:57,371 --> 00:15:59,671
the perp couldn't have jumped down.

267
00:16:01,271 --> 00:16:04,171
There's a car parked right below the veranda.

268
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,471
Why is it parked in a place like that?

269
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:10,371
Mr. Kokuri?

270
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:13,271
So, it's Mr. Kokuri's car that was mentioned a while ago.

271
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:15,871
It's a convertible.

272
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,771
Nice car.

273
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:21,771
But it's strange.

274
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:24,271
The parking lot's pretty much open and yet.

275
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:27,271
I wonder why he parked his car in a place like that?

276
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:35,471
I guess I'll take a picture of it with my smartphone just in case.

277
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:55,071
And also just in case,

278
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:57,071
I'll take a picture of the back side of the veranda, too.

279
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:01,171
Conan.

280
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:03,071
Pops Kogoro is calling you.

281
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:05,571
He says he's finished searching the room.

282
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:06,871
Okay.

283
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:08,571
Sorry to have intruded on you.

284
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:14,571
So! It's just like I told you.

285
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:17,071
That boy's keen and sharp, isn't he?

286
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:22,571
More importantly, solve the case as fast as you can!

287
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:24,971
If the police search this room,

288
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:28,371
they'll find out about me, too.

289
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:33,171
That guy'll hear about the Koji Haneda murder case

290
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:35,771
and show up before that happens.

291
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:39,371
Okay.

292
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:48,571
A bowtie?

293
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:03,871
Understand the process of the body being found,

294
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:06,171
but the minute you opened the front door,

295
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:08,871
the wine glass and plate fell and cracked.

296
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:13,271
So somebody rushed and fled, you say but that's really hard to believe.

297
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:14,571
Just about that time

298
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:18,171
a renovation construction of the room below was underway

299
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:20,671
and it shook a bit, correct?

300
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:21,871
Yes, sir.

301
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:26,071
The construction starts every day from 9:00 a.m.

302
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,671
You and the others entered this room

303
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:31,171
just around 9:00 a.m. too, didn't you?

304
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:32,971
Yes.

305
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:38,371
If so, and the glass cup and plate were placed at the edge of the table,

306
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:40,471
it would've fallen to the floor at the slightest shake of the construction.

307
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:41,971
Then, why don't you place your cell phones

308
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:45,971
at the edge of the table and try it out?

309
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:47,571
True.

310
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:52,871
Are you ready?

311
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:54,571
Here goes!

312
00:18:56,471 --> 00:18:57,771
Huh?

313
00:18:57,771 --> 00:19:00,171
Half of the cell phones fell, but what about the other half?

314
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:02,371
They're still on the table?

315
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:04,471
I see! Although it may sway,

316
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:06,571
you don't know which way it'll sway

317
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:08,671
so all of the cell phones won't fall!

318
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,071
I see.

319
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:12,871
Even if the dishes were to be placed on the edge of the table,

320
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:15,471
the chances of them falling to the floor are fifty-fifty.

321
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:17,771
It'd be difficult to use as a trick.

322
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:19,271
You're right.

323
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,571
Besides, there's no guarantee

324
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:24,071
that the construction would start at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

325
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:28,571
As to that, the construction was always set to start at 9:00.

326
00:19:28,571 --> 00:19:30,171
The construction was delayed

327
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:33,071
and the hotel was pressuring them to rush things on.

328
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,671
Even so, you couldn't really tell whether they would start at 9:00 sharp.

329
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:38,671
Well, as to that, we once had a complaint from a guest

330
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:43,471
that the construction started a minute early!

331
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:46,271
So the constructors seem to have been adjusting their watches

332
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:48,171
to that of the hotel to be accurate to the second, you see.

333
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:49,171
I see.

334
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:54,571
Even so, it's just a coincidence that we opened the door at 9:00 sharp.

335
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:57,271
We opened the door at that time to begin with

336
00:19:57,271 --> 00:20:00,771
only because it took Mr. Korkuri some time to get the bellboy to come.

337
00:20:01,571 --> 00:20:04,171
Jeez. What's taking him so long?

338
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:06,971
What is that director doing?

339
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:08,371
There they are.

340
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:12,171
I'm sorry. It took me a while to explain.

341
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:14,371
Mr. Kokuri only went to call the bellboy

342
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:18,271
because he noticed an incoming e-mail from Mr. Hotta.

343
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:22,571
Huh? Mr. Hotta mailed me an hour ago.

344
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:23,871
What?

345
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:26,071
"I'm going to be killed. Help me!"

346
00:20:26,071 --> 00:20:28,271
Hey, hey. Are you serious?

347
00:20:28,271 --> 00:20:32,571
Anyway, I'll go get the bellboy and have him unlock the door.

348
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:35,571
Mr. Mouri, please keep on the lookout

349
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:37,371
so that no one suspicious comes out of the room.

350
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:38,871
Okay.

351
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,671
Moreover, that e-mail came in an hour

352
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:44,271
before Mr. Kokuri even realized that he got it.

353
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:46,371
If he had noticed right away,

354
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:50,071
we would've come into this room way earlier.

355
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,971
There's no room for tricks.

356
00:20:53,971 --> 00:20:54,971
No!

357
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:58,571
So the perp realized that we came in, fled in a hurry,

358
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:00,271
dropped and cracked the dishes then...

359
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:02,771
What's wrong, Officer Takagi?

360
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:05,271
No. It seems that something got on my hand

361
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:07,671
when I pounded the table a while ago.

362
00:21:07,671 --> 00:21:10,271
I wonder if this is salt?

363
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,971
Salt?

364
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,271
I see!

365
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:16,271
If salt were used, what the Inspector was saying would also...

366
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:20,371
On top of that, the coincidence that Pops was talking about would all...

367
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:21,971
Really?

368
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:23,471
When you pounded the desk right above

369
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:26,171
where the dishes were on the floor,

370
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:29,871
salt got on the base of your pinky.

371
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,071
Really?

372
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:32,971
Hey, hey.

373
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:38,171
It sounds like you're trying to explain things in detail to somebody.

374
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,771
Wrong.

375
00:21:39,771 --> 00:21:42,171
I have a habit of repeating things to myself.

376
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:44,671
I organize my thoughts by repeating things to myself!

377
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,271
Didn't you know?

378
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,571
Really?

379
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:50,871
I didn't know at all.

380
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:46,271
"Next Episode" -And Mr. Mouri,

381
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:50,271
did you really see somebody flee from the window?

382
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:52,971
Yes, sir! I saw it clearly with these eyes of mine!

383
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:55,071
How about it, Conan?

384
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:58,271
Yep. It's a bit sticky, though.

385
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:01,571
You found a trace of something pasted above the window.

386
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:04,771
What's this?

387
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:06,271
What's the matter?

388
00:24:06,271 --> 00:24:08,871
Did you find something?

389
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:13,971
