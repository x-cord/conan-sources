1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,349
That was delicious.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,730
I'm full, too.

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,980
What a truly delicious meal.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,179
Given its effect on Japan's economy,

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,670
we can afford this kind of luxury once in a while.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,240
Hey, kid. Don't forget to thank me.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,649
You're right. Thanks, Mister.

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,389
Finally, a word from Kureno-san.

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,249
Thanks for holding this company dissolution party.

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,349
Are they the guests in the private room?

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,510
Sounds like it.

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,349
Thanks to all of you, this term our company did the best it's ever done.

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,020
Unfortunately, despite our success, we've decided to sell the company.

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,279
This decision was made with all of our interests in mind.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,139
I'm not abandoning you and running away.

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,230
Make sure you don't resent me for this.

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,439
Hold on.

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,040
I don't agree with the decision to sell at all.

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,659
He's right. Wouldn't we normally discuss this first?

20
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,540
It's too sudden.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,649
It's fine.

22
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,259
You guys know our president isn't the type of person to explain every little thing.

23
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,829
Now, now.

24
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,590
Sir, thank you for all your hard work.

25
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,100
This isn't much, but it's a reflection of how we feel.

26
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,590
What's this?

27
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,490
Thank you.

28
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:33,610
Guys, thinking back, I know things were tough when we first started,

29
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,870
but the company grew this much because we worked together.

30
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,720
I'm overjoyed that we made it to today.

31
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:46,810
I can't breathe...

32
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:47,990
Sir?

33
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,629
Th-This is a joke, right?

34
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,630
Kureno!

35
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,759
I-It's an emergency.

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,549
Narita-san, call an ambulance!

37
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,510
Got it.

38
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,260
Seriously?

39
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,250
Are you okay, Kureno?

40
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,940
Kureno?

41
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,730
Hey, Kureno!

42
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,230
Kureno!

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,010
Kureno!

44
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,399
Find the question that solves the mystery!

45
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,499
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

46
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,659
A dissolving company hosts its last party!

47
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,099
Identify the motives of all the witnesses!

48
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,709
Always determining the one truth

49
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,329
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

50
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,920
his name is Detective Conan!

51
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:16,027
The Company Dissolution Party

52
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:21,484
The deceased is the president of online shopping website "Clerno", Kureno Jiro-san.

53
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:25,734
He came here today to eat with his staff.

54
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:29,203
And the man who reported the incident is...

55
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:30,304
Inspector.

56
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:33,044
Mori-kun.

57
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:38,621
I happened to be eating in the hall over there.

58
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:41,431
I came running when I heard shouting.

59
00:04:41,432 --> 00:04:45,461
Mori-kun, you didn't witness the death?

60
00:04:45,462 --> 00:04:46,932
I didn't see anything.

61
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:50,312
So, what's the cause of death?

62
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,081
We believe he was poisoned.

63
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:54,862
Poisoned?

64
00:04:57,072 --> 00:04:59,612
Judging by the photo stuck to the bouquet,

65
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:02,742
all the employees seemed to get along.

66
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:04,242
Huh?

67
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:05,872
What's this?

68
00:05:06,962 --> 00:05:09,792
Hey, is this mark on his neck—

69
00:05:10,162 --> 00:05:11,701
C-Conan-kun?

70
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:13,881
You're always sticking your nose where it doesn't belong!

71
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:16,051
Conan-kun, you shouldn't do that.

72
00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:17,381
Go someplace else.

73
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:19,512
Sorry.

74
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:23,801
Jeez. Anyway, what's this mark on his neck?

75
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:25,221
Oh, right.

76
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:30,501
The bouquet Kureno-san received during the meal had a poison needle hidden in it.

77
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:35,651
When he took the bouquet in his hands, the needle stabbed and poisoned him.

78
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:37,902
It left a mark on his neck.

79
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:42,032
So, who prepared the bouquet?

80
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:44,532
It was Toda-san.

81
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:48,692
But the other three also touched the bouquet.

82
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:52,542
Let's start by questioning everybody.

83
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:59,802
Forgive me for asking, Toda-san, but did you join the company after its formation?

84
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:05,092
Yes. I began working for President Kureno five years ago.

85
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:09,562
Until then, I'd been doing planning for an advertising agency.

86
00:06:09,782 --> 00:06:14,562
I was recruited by this company, who was one of our clients at the time.

87
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:18,572
What were you going to do after the company was dissolved?

88
00:06:18,722 --> 00:06:22,091
I hadn't received a formal offer,

89
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:25,952
but I was planning to work with Kureno-san on his next project.

90
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:29,952
Toda-kun, you've helped me a lot until now.

91
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:35,962
I'd like you to serve in an even better position on my next project.

92
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:38,182
Thank you.

93
00:06:38,922 --> 00:06:43,092
So there's no way I would have killed President Kureno.

94
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:48,722
But we've been told the poison was in the bouquet you handed to him.

95
00:06:48,902 --> 00:06:51,391
The bouquet was a surprise.

96
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:54,932
I hadn't touched it since the start of the party.

97
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:59,551
Toda-san, do you have any idea what happened to Kureno-san?

98
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,572
Was there anyone who resented him?

99
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,952
I don't wish to speak ill of my friends,

100
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:09,652
but I do have some idea.

101
00:07:10,672 --> 00:07:12,702
It's the designer Kamijo-san.

102
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:16,251
He was originally a famous web designer.

103
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:18,712
He's been overbearing since he joined the team.

104
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:23,342
On top of that, he's a big spender and keeps taking out advances on his salary.

105
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:27,962
Kamijo-san is in the most trouble if this team is dissolved.

106
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:31,222
Man, what a hassle.

107
00:07:31,462 --> 00:07:35,232
I can't remember how long ago I started.

108
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,732
President Kureno suddenly contacted me one day.

109
00:07:39,202 --> 00:07:43,071
I thought I'd live the laid-back freelance life forever,

110
00:07:43,072 --> 00:07:46,742
but his terms were so generous, I agreed to work for him.

111
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:51,421
You didn't approve of the company's dissolution, correct?

112
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:54,492
We heard you requested advances on your salary.

113
00:07:54,752 --> 00:07:57,241
It has nothing to do with money!

114
00:07:57,242 --> 00:08:00,382
He always made decisions on his own,

115
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:05,762
but it was awful of him to make such a big decision without discussing it with me first.

116
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:09,341
I suppose you're right.

117
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:14,061
By the way, Kamijo-san, what are you planning to do after the team is dissolved?

118
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:15,301
Who knows?

119
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:18,031
I haven't decided yet, but since I was originally freelance,

120
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:20,192
I'll be fine without a company.

121
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:22,221
Oh, right.

122
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:26,942
I think this was done by someone with a personal grudge.

123
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,471
A personal grudge?

124
00:08:29,472 --> 00:08:30,202
Yeah.

125
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:34,952
So why don't you examine our belongings some more?

126
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:39,362
We did take a quick look through everyone's belongings.

127
00:08:41,382 --> 00:08:42,962
Inspector, look at this.

128
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:46,242
We found this among Narita-san's belongings.

129
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:51,171
I joined Kureno-san's team eight years ago.

130
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:53,342
I was in charge of accounting.

131
00:08:53,562 --> 00:08:57,221
How did you end up joining Kureno-san's team?

132
00:08:57,222 --> 00:09:00,232
I knew the president from before.

133
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:02,111
Forgive me for asking,

134
00:09:02,112 --> 00:09:07,112
but were you and President Kureno dating?

135
00:09:07,322 --> 00:09:10,971
Yes, although shortly after that picture was taken,

136
00:09:10,972 --> 00:09:15,261
he said he'd fallen in love with someone else and broke up with me.

137
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:16,872
I'm sorry to hear that.

138
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:18,182
It's fine.

139
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:22,731
Jiro-san genuinely recognized the work I did.

140
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:24,882
That was enough to make me happy.

141
00:09:25,112 --> 00:09:29,381
By the way, was there anyone who had problems with Kureno-san?

142
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:31,062
Well...

143
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:33,932
There's Koshimoto-san.

144
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:39,281
Yes, Kureno and I had been friends since college.

145
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:41,791
We'd been together since the site was established.

146
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:44,402
I was in charge of merchandise.

147
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:49,611
We heard you often clashed with Kureno-san.

148
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:52,402
Yeah, we argued all the time.

149
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:54,921
But so, what?

150
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:59,912
We were just good enough friends that we could say anything to each other.

151
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:03,292
If you suspect me, you should look into Toda!

152
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:06,971
He had clients entertaining him practically every day.

153
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:08,802
He was spoiled.

154
00:10:09,212 --> 00:10:14,302
I think he'd hate to lose that luxurious lifestyle.

155
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:20,901
It sounds like all the suspects have motives.

156
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:21,682
Yes.

157
00:10:21,683 --> 00:10:23,251
Who do you think did it?

158
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:25,562
It was probably Toda-san.

159
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,672
The poison was in the bouquet he prepared.

160
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:31,192
Excuse me.

161
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:36,152
Inspector, we received new testimony from the restaurant staff.

162
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:42,272
Inspector, I'm certain it was Toda.

163
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:44,392
Yes.

164
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:46,832
Thank you.

165
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:48,852
Excuse me.

166
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:51,421
Mister, what are you doing?

167
00:10:51,422 --> 00:10:52,092
Huh?

168
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:55,551
Oh. It's just you, kid.

169
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:59,081
I received an important phone call.

170
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:00,512
An important call?

171
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:05,311
I'm actually being recruited by a client.

172
00:11:05,312 --> 00:11:08,251
I didn't trust President Kureno,

173
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,522
so I was secretly in discussions with them.

174
00:11:11,632 --> 00:11:13,232
How bold...

175
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:17,532
I don't want the police to suspect me, so don't tell them.

176
00:11:17,902 --> 00:11:19,782
This should keep you quiet.

177
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:22,101
Thanks.

178
00:11:22,102 --> 00:11:24,912
It's a unsold product from our site.

179
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:28,702
Our imported toys were our top sellers.

180
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,572
It's so cool.

181
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:35,571
What? Is that true?

182
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:36,492
Yes.

183
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:39,932
The bouquet was here during the meal.

184
00:11:40,522 --> 00:11:44,931
That tall man crouched over the bouquet and fiddled with it.

185
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:47,331
You're absolutely certain?

186
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,062
Yes.

187
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:51,661
Thank you for the valuable information.

188
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:53,412
Well, I should go.

189
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:58,072
I knew it. I knew Koshimoto was suspicious from the start.

190
00:11:58,922 --> 00:12:00,822
The old man's in great form today.

191
00:12:01,142 --> 00:12:04,681
Koshimoto-san was in charge of merchandise.

192
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:10,101
He could have imported a poison along with the other merchandise.

193
00:12:10,102 --> 00:12:12,282
Inspector, it was definitely him.

194
00:12:13,662 --> 00:12:16,092
I can't believe this is happening.

195
00:12:16,422 --> 00:12:21,512
Come to think of it, Toda, you're the one who suggested we throw a company dissolution party.

196
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,351
What does that mean?

197
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:24,892
You think I did it?

198
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:26,361
Who knows?

199
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:28,022
I don't know about that.

200
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:33,821
I know you were borrowing money from Kureno-san.

201
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:35,171
So, what?

202
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,821
That has nothing to do with this.

203
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,751
Cut it out.

204
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:40,322
The president just died.

205
00:12:40,652 --> 00:12:41,681
What?

206
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:45,332
A man just died, and you're fixing your makeup.

207
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:50,462
Sorry to interrupt.

208
00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:53,382
Where's Koshimoto-san?

209
00:12:54,162 --> 00:12:55,252
Now that you mention it...

210
00:12:58,262 --> 00:13:00,512
Koshimoto-san, where are you going?

211
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:02,831
To the bathroom.

212
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:06,681
Should you be leaving the room without the police's permission?

213
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:09,421
We don't know how long we'll be waiting.

214
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,782
I'm sure it's fine if we go to the bathroom.

215
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:15,721
He's been gone since he left for the bathroom a while ago.

216
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:18,411
Come to think of it, he hasn't been back since.

217
00:13:18,412 --> 00:13:19,532
What?

218
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:22,142
What's wrong?

219
00:13:22,143 --> 00:13:23,631
Koshimoto-san ran off.

220
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:24,512
What?

221
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:29,042
But Mister, there are police posted at the restaurant exits.

222
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:30,271
You're right.

223
00:13:30,272 --> 00:13:33,191
Then Koshimoto-san is still inside the building.

224
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:34,491
Find him immediately.

225
00:13:34,492 --> 00:13:35,292
Yes, sir.

226
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:37,172
I'll help.

227
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,232
He wasn't in the hall.

228
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:45,432
Nothing to report in the private rooms.

229
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:47,682
Nothing to report in the kitchen.

230
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,741
He's not at the tables either.

231
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:50,622
Got it.

232
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:53,562
Inspector, he's not at the tables.

233
00:13:58,582 --> 00:13:59,322
Huh?

234
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,582
Is something the matter?

235
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:03,572
What?

236
00:14:13,242 --> 00:14:16,442
No!

237
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,239
Inspector Megure, this was found next to the body.

238
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,260
Let's see...

239
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,969
"I killed Kureno."

240
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,409
"The team succeeded because of me."

241
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,099
"He claimed credit for everything."

242
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,520
"I couldn't forgive him."

243
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,299
In other words, it's a suicide note.

244
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,579
We were able to confirm that it's definitely Koshimoto-san's handwriting.

245
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,420
Inspector.

246
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,789
The poison thought to be used in Kureno-san's murder

247
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,660
was found in the body's jacket pocket.

248
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,299
Inspector Megure.

249
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:50,980
All right.

250
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:52,849
We're starting to get the full picture.

251
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,660
Send the body to the coroner.

252
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,670
What's going on?

253
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,599
Kamijo-san's right.

254
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,219
If I hadn't planned this party...

255
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,179
Don't say that.

256
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,930
It's not your fault.

257
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,159
First the president, then Koshimoto-san...

258
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,619
Why is this happening?

259
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,689
Kamijo-kun, cut it out!

260
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,430
Excuse me.

261
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,340
Coming through.

262
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,440
Excuse me, coming through.

263
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,639
No, they're wrong.

264
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,250
Koshimoto-san was probably killed by one of them.

265
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,009
Ran, kid. We're leaving.

266
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,350
What? We're leaving already?

267
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,040
It's already so late.

268
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,609
I see. I figured it out.

269
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,760
But I need to find a way to check the back of the house.

270
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,050
Hey, Mister.

271
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,429
My toy car is in a room back there.

272
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,769
I'd like to get it before we leave.

273
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,520
Jeez. You're hopeless.

274
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,049
Did you find it?

275
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,900
No. That's odd...

276
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,410
I knew it.

277
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,010
Are you sure it isn't over here?

278
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,290
What's the meaning of this, Mori-san?

279
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,570
I apologize for keeping everyone here.

280
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,800
I finally figured out the truth behind this case.

281
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,089
But Mori-san, the note was written by Koshimoto-san.

282
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,560
We even found evidence.

283
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,860
That's correct.

284
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,310
Koshimoto-san killed President Kureno.

285
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,610
He poisoned the needle, hid it inside the bouquet, and killed him.

286
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,650
But the problem is Koshimoto-san's death.

287
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,570
He didn't kill himself. He was summoned here and murdered.

288
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,599
He either wrote the suicide note voluntarily

289
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,710
or was made to write it by his killer.

290
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,969
By the way, Detective Takagi,

291
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,959
could you move to the middle of the room?

292
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,839
What? Okay.

293
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,529
Look closely at the floor.

294
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,590
All right.

295
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,310
There's a faint smudge on the floor.

296
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,599
It looks like something was dragged through here.

297
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,060
Which means his shoe came off when he was dragged.

298
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,170
That's right.

299
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,820
His murder probably wasn't planned.

300
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,070
Allow me to explain.

301
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,570
First, the culprit strangled Koshimoto-san to death using some kind of string.

302
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,020
They dragged the body to the door and attempted to make his death look like a suicide.

303
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,429
However, in their rush to leave,

304
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,590
the culprit left the scene of the crime without replacing his shoe on his foot.

305
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,799
Who left the room after Koshimoto-san?

306
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,829
Everyone, actually.

307
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,949
I went to make a phone call.

308
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,850
But I was with the boy then.

309
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,479
Yeah. I ran into him, and he gave me a toy car.

310
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,850
C-Conan-kun.

311
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,799
I went to the restroom, but I didn't run into anyone.

312
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,490
I left the room, too, but I just went out into the hallway.

313
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,599
What were you doing in the hallway?

314
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,759
I was talking to a female employee.

315
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,960
Excuse me.

316
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,580
He's telling the truth. I'm sure of it.

317
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,319
You're exactly my type.

318
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,620
Please, you're bothering me.

319
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,880
I-In any case, I have an alibi.

320
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,969
Wait a minute. That means...

321
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,600
The culprit is...

322
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,100
Yes, that's correct.

323
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:51,110
The only person here who doesn't have an alibi is Narita-san.

324
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,749
N-No way! And that alone makes me the culprit?

325
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,240
You don't even have proof!

326
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,299
Well, Mori-kun?

327
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,450
Don't worry, Inspector.

328
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,249
There is proof.

329
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,120
What?

330
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:09,119
The culprit still has in their possession the weapon they used to kill Koshimoto-san.

331
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,130
You're saying the weapon isn't the wine napkin hanging off the door?

332
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,509
It's not that.

333
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:20,640
The weapon is something much thinner than a wine napkin.

334
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:26,140
If you look at the body, you can see that the skin is raised just inside the ligature marks.

335
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,379
After strangling him using some type of string or cord,

336
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,400
the culprit strangled him again with the wine napkin.

337
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,900
But Narita-san doesn't have anything like that on her.

338
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,320
Could it be?

339
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,329
Come on, Narita-san.

340
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,580
If I'm wrong, let the police borrow your bag.

341
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:56,090
Your bag's shoulder strap and the ligature marks should be a perfect match.

342
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,749
Narita-san?

343
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,320
Why?

344
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,889
I didn't mean to kill him.

345
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,350
Then why?!

346
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,850
I couldn't forgive him after what he said.

347
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,399
Around the time the decision to dissolve the company was made,

348
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,860
I found a strangely expensive and mysterious product among his purchases.

349
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,260
For a long time, I wondered what it was.

350
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,929
Please be honest with me.

351
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,619
Did you import a poison?

352
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,620
You killed the president, didn't you?

353
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,279
What should I do?

354
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,950
I've done something crazy!

355
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,630
Koshimoto-san...

356
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,759
I always resented him.

357
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,059
He claimed sole credit for all our success,

358
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,629
even though he couldn't do anything without me.

359
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,140
So I...

360
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,809
Koshimoto-san, turn yourself in.

361
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,390
I'll go with you to the police.

362
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,860
All right.

363
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:03,089
But don't you think this was bound to happen?

364
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,530
What do you mean?

365
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,419
There isn't anyone who truly loved that selfish guy.

366
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,069
He was surrounded by enemies.

367
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,710
Even if I hadn't done it, this would've happened to him eventually.

368
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,460
Both you and I were just being used

369
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,210
by that piece of trash.

370
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,449
What?

371
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,550
What did you say?

372
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,409
I looked up to the president.

373
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,600
I wanted to someday become an executive just like him.

374
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,969
I couldn't forgive him for insulting him.

375
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,339
And besides, Koshimoto-san didn't seem to know,

376
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,240
but the president said he wanted to work with this team again someday.

377
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,740
That's what he told me.

378
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,960
Dad, let's go.

379
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,510
Excuse me.

380
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,010
With everything that happened, I forgot to give this to you.

381
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,220
Here. This is for you.

382
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,650
That's great, Conan-kun.

383
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,650
Thanks.

384
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,230
I can't believe I got a second one...

385
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,059
What?

386
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,490
But I just painted my nails.

387
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,120
It's those girls from earlier.

388
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,149
Ayaka, are you making fun of this job?

389
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,120
Mina-san.

390
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,370
Let's try to get along while we're working on this campaign.

391
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,500
Ran-neechan, doesn't this seem the other way around?

392
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,010
The other way around?

393
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,090
The next episode of Conan is "The Feuding Girls!"
