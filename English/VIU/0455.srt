1
00:00:01,539 --> 00:00:03,039
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:04,739
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:06,639
The upside down trick is finally solved!

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,139
An unfinished manuscript corners the killer.

5
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:10,539
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:12,239
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:14,539
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:59,645
I, Toshihisa Manda who was confined to my room at the hotel

9
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:02,345
snuck out of the hotel

10
00:02:02,345 --> 00:02:07,545
and killed my disciple and ghost writer Kohei Haramoto!

11
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:10,045
Soon afterwards, I returned to the hotel

12
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:13,145
and established a fake alibi.

13
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:15,145
We were playing baseball

14
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:18,445
and ended up chasing the ball over to Mr. Haramoto's place.

15
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:21,045
And, in the house...

16
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,245
We find Mr. Haramoto who had been murdered!

17
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:36,045
"Result of the Tumble (Part 2)"

18
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:37,545
I see.

19
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:40,245
So, when you children came to look for the ball

20
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:42,145
and took a look into this house,

21
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:45,845
you found this man bleeding from the head and lying on the ground.

22
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:49,245
I wonder if a robber did this.

23
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:52,445
The place doesn't seem to be all that messed up, though.

24
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:55,945
I think the killer knows him.

25
00:02:55,945 --> 00:02:58,145
What?

26
00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:59,545
Look here.

27
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:03,845
There's a sign that says "Do Not Enter" on the door of this room.

28
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:05,345
And what about it?

29
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:08,245
It tells you that somebody's in the room.

30
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:09,445
Right.

31
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:11,145
If somebody opens the door, the owner of the house will see him.

32
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:14,245
It'd be impossible to go around behind him without being noticed.

33
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:16,645
In my case, I would deliberately make noise,

34
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:19,145
and when the person comes out of the room,

35
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:23,545
I would be waiting with the murder weapon in my hand ready to kill him.

36
00:03:23,545 --> 00:03:25,145
What a frightening thing to say, Ai.

37
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:29,545
Right, I'm sure Mr. Haramoto let the killer into the room himself.

38
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:31,845
A person like you that he knows well.

39
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,045
Huh?

40
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:35,845
What's the estimated time of death that the coroner came up with?

41
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:39,445
About two hours ago, about 3 in the afternoon.

42
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:41,745
By the way, where were you about that time?

43
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:45,145
I was confined to my room at the New Beika Hotel right through

44
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:46,845
since last night.

45
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:50,245
New Beika Hotel is near here.

46
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:51,845
2 or 3 minutes by car,

47
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:54,145
and it wouldn't take more than 10 minutes if by bike.

48
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:56,545
Mr. Shimaki, were you with him too?

49
00:03:56,545 --> 00:04:01,245
No. I was at the elevator hall near Sensei's room

50
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:03,845
waiting for the manuscripts to be completed.

51
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:07,745
But, unless he passes by me, he can't leave the hotel,

52
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:10,545
so I don't think he could've snuck out.

53
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:13,145
And when was the manuscript completed?

54
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:16,845
Hey, hey, don't tell me you're suspecting me?

55
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:18,245
No, that's not it.

56
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:20,645
We're asking just to be safe. And?

57
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:24,345
Yes, it was completed at about 4pm.

58
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:27,445
After that, I checked the manuscript in the room of the hotel.

59
00:04:27,445 --> 00:04:29,545
Then in order to discuss the next novel,

60
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:31,945
we took a cab over to Sensei's house.

61
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:33,145
I see.

62
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:35,745
Could there have been a friend of Mr. Haramoto,

63
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:38,545
who harbored a grudge against him?

64
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,445
I wonder. He was a reticent man.

65
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:43,145
He said that he wanted to be a novelist

66
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:47,645
so I had him help me organize my manuscripts and stuff like that.

67
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:51,745
That's why a lot of my novels are in his computer.

68
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:54,045
Even the ones that were turned down are inside.

69
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:55,745
A while ago, you mentioned that

70
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:59,045
you were letting him live in this house or something like that.

71
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:03,645
Yes, this is the house that I lived in with my family

72
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:04,845
but it was getting to small for us,

73
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:07,745
so we had to get a new house across the street.

74
00:05:07,745 --> 00:05:10,545
Well, my sons have left the house and are on their own,

75
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:11,845
my wife has already passed away,

76
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:15,245
and I'm living in the house opposite all alone.

77
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:17,245
I didn't feel like having the house demolished,

78
00:05:17,245 --> 00:05:19,945
so I had him live here.

79
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,445
For living here alone, his place is quite organized.

80
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:26,845
He had a housekeeper come here once a week.

81
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:33,145
But! I think that Mr. Haramoto liked to organize things to begin with

82
00:05:33,145 --> 00:05:35,745
because only a mirror is in the drawer.

83
00:05:35,745 --> 00:05:37,845
Hey, Conan!

84
00:05:37,845 --> 00:05:40,545
But something's strange.

85
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:42,345
There are blood stains on the desk

86
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:44,445
and a cracked piece of the flower vase on the mirror,

87
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:47,345
there's no blood in the drawer.

88
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:49,945
It looks as if something else were in here.

89
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:50,945
What?

90
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:55,245
So the culprit was after something that was in this drawer?

91
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:58,245
Mr. Manda, do you have any idea what it could've been?

92
00:05:58,245 --> 00:05:59,745
No.

93
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:03,845
By the way, I think it's about time that you realize.

94
00:06:03,845 --> 00:06:08,045
Right. There something even stranger in the room over here.

95
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:10,245
Strange?

96
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,445
See, in this room.

97
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:14,145
The shelf, shelf!

98
00:06:14,145 --> 00:06:19,145
The mini cars, dolls and, books are all toppled upside!

99
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,145
True.

100
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:22,445
Why?

101
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:24,945
What the...

102
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:26,745
A cat?

103
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:28,645
Your cat?

104
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:32,245
You shouldn't leave your cat to roam at the scene of the crime!

105
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:33,545
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:36,845
I was so upset that I completely forgot.

107
00:06:36,845 --> 00:06:38,945
Inspector, a woman has come in front the back door.

108
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,445
What's with you people

109
00:06:40,445 --> 00:06:42,745
entering into someone else's house without permission?

110
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:45,245
Ms. Ichimura.

111
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:48,145
Oh, Sensei, you're here?

112
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:50,745
What? Mr. Haramoto was...

113
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:54,545
I didn't do it. I'm just a housekeeper.

114
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:56,245
Oh, so you're the housekeeper.

115
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:58,145
Then could you tell us?

116
00:06:58,145 --> 00:06:59,245
Yes?

117
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:05,745
Oh, this is Mr. Haramoto's mischief.

118
00:07:05,745 --> 00:07:07,145
His mischief?

119
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:11,245
Yes, he usually does incomprehensible mischief.

120
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:13,845
Such as stacking slippers up high one after the other,

121
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:17,545
loosen all the light bulbs in the house making them unusable,

122
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:21,145
line up video tapes in the locker and set them up like dominos.

123
00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:25,045
Then he watches what happens from hiding and grins.

124
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:30,145
He like to watch me troubled putting everything back in order.

125
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:32,545
So, it's the same thing here.

126
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:36,745
Because of course he knows I'll be here at this time.

127
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:39,645
Oh, so it was just mischief?

128
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:41,845
But, if so, it's understandable.

129
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:45,045
Yes, although it's really childish.

130
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:48,445
Really. I was wondering what kind of trick this was.

131
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:51,845
No. Mr. Haramoto's not the one who turned everything upside down,

132
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:53,145
the culprit did it.

133
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:56,545
See. Look at this book.

134
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:59,045
The cover is out of place and ripped, right?

135
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,845
It's proof that this was turned upside hastily.

136
00:08:01,845 --> 00:08:04,045
There is a mini car with a broken side mirror,

137
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:06,945
and even a doll that has fallen inside the case.

138
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,145
These are important collections for Mr. Haramoto.

139
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:14,145
Even if he were to do mischief, I'm sure he'd be more careful.

140
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:16,245
-And... -Since he knew

141
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,345
the housekeeper was coming in two hours,

142
00:08:18,345 --> 00:08:21,045
he didn't have to rush, is what you want to say, right?

143
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:22,545
Right.

144
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:25,945
Then, the culprit's the one who did it after all, but why?

145
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:28,845
The most thinkable thing is to hide something.

146
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:32,945
Yeah. If only one is turned upside down,

147
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:37,145
it would look unnatural so other things were also turned upside down.

148
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:41,145
May I be excused to leave?

149
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,045
It's time that I have to return to the editing section.

150
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:47,845
Hey, you're coming back after you finish the proof, aren't you?

151
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:50,945
We've got to discuss the next story.

152
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:53,745
But Sensei, we couldn't possibly discuss the next mystery story

153
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:54,945
on a day like this.

154
00:08:54,945 --> 00:08:56,445
Mystery?

155
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:59,245
I thought you only wrote historical novels.

156
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:02,445
I'm going to challenge a new field.

157
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:04,945
To tell the truth, it's almost completed.

158
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,745
Come to think of it, there were some lined out on that shelf too.

159
00:09:07,745 --> 00:09:11,145
Yeah, more than half were mystery stories.

160
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:14,545
Yes, yes, Mr. Haramoto liked detective stories.

161
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:18,745
He used to say that his debut novel would be a detective story.

162
00:09:18,745 --> 00:09:21,745
The detective that Mr. Haramoto was thinking of

163
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:23,845
-was an interesting character. -Ms. Ichimura,

164
00:09:23,845 --> 00:09:26,845
didn't he ask you to do something for him today?

165
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:28,045
What?

166
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:32,245
Well, he used to often ask you to go buy things for his collection

167
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:35,245
when he didn't have time to go out.

168
00:09:35,245 --> 00:09:38,845
Today, he asked for morning call and...

169
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:42,045
oh, he asked me to make a dentist appointment too, that's about it.

170
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:44,545
I didn't go buy anything for him.

171
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:46,245
I see. Well, the thing is,

172
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:49,245
when I called him a while ago from the hotel, he said that

173
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:51,745
he was glad that his collection was completed.

174
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:53,345
Oh well, forget it, then.

175
00:09:53,345 --> 00:09:56,645
He was probably talking about some useless collection again.

176
00:09:56,645 --> 00:09:58,845
You called Mr. Haramoto today?

177
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:01,545
Yes. When I'm stuck making a story,

178
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:04,545
I call him a lot for a change of mood.

179
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:06,445
How was he back then?

180
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:10,145
He was his own usual self.

181
00:10:10,145 --> 00:10:11,945
I see.

182
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,845
What do you see?

183
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:16,045
Don't tell me you've figured out who the killer is?

184
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:19,545
Yeah, the culprit didn't try to hide things by turning them upside down,

185
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:22,945
but thought that it would be hidden if things were turned upside down!

186
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:30,097
The culprit didn't try to hide things by turning them upside down?

187
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,897
But thought that it would be hidden if things were turned upside down?

188
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:34,297
Rather, to put it accurately,

189
00:10:34,297 --> 00:10:36,497
the culprit thought that it would hide it for him.

190
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:38,097
Hide it?

191
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:39,097
Hide what?

192
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,997
Well, proof of that was kind of messed up

193
00:10:41,997 --> 00:10:44,197
because the culprit got the upper hand, though.

194
00:10:44,197 --> 00:10:45,697
Hey, don't tell me...

195
00:10:45,697 --> 00:10:47,297
That he's the culprit?

196
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:49,297
Yeah, most likely.

197
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:53,697
Okay, I'll finish the proofs and the editing section and come back.

198
00:10:53,697 --> 00:10:55,697
Then, could I be excused too?

199
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:59,697
I'd like to prepare for the discussion, and take him home too.

200
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:00,797
All right.

201
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:03,997
I'll be at home right opposite here, so please call me if you need me.

202
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,897
Hey, he's going to leave!

203
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:07,697
Is it okay, Conan?

204
00:11:07,697 --> 00:11:10,497
You're going to be discussing a detective story

205
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:13,597
that you've never written before, aren't you, sir?

206
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:16,097
-Yeah. -I can't wait to read it

207
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:18,697
because I just love mystery stories!

208
00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:21,797
I wonder if any of it is in Mr. Haramoto's computer.

209
00:11:21,797 --> 00:11:24,397
I wonder.

210
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:28,797
Huh, why are you letting him go off so cheerfully?

211
00:11:28,797 --> 00:11:31,297
I thought you were going to corner the culprit.

212
00:11:31,297 --> 00:11:35,797
Well, I guess you have your reasons for doing what you're doing.

213
00:11:35,797 --> 00:11:39,097
But, your attitude of knowing all by yourself and snickering

214
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:40,297
really bugs me.

215
00:11:40,297 --> 00:11:43,297
Okay, I'll tell you!

216
00:11:43,297 --> 00:11:45,397
But, promise you'll cooperate.

217
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:48,097
-Sure! -Of course.

218
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:51,997
I mean, his disciple's just been murdered

219
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:54,997
and I don't see how he can go on with the discussion.

220
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:55,997
True.

221
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:59,497
What should I do?

222
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:00,997
Yeah, that's right.

223
00:12:00,997 --> 00:12:03,697
Well, this mini car is broken!

224
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:06,297
The side mirror is broken off.

225
00:12:06,297 --> 00:12:08,597
I didn't touch it.

226
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:13,697
Which means that the person who did this was really upset?

227
00:12:13,697 --> 00:12:15,597
But, it's strange.

228
00:12:15,597 --> 00:12:20,997
Mr. Haramoto did all this to surprise the housekeeper, right?

229
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:22,097
That's right,

230
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:25,297
because he knew that the housekeeper would be here at 5pm.

231
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:28,997
I'm sure this collection wasn't all that important to him.

232
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:32,597
But, the novelist said that Mr. Haramoto was saying that

233
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:35,597
his collection was completed so that he was happy.

234
00:12:35,597 --> 00:12:39,497
The point is what collections he's talking about.

235
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:41,897
Yes, we can't tell by his words

236
00:12:41,897 --> 00:12:45,797
whether it was the mini cars, the dolls or the books.

237
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:47,797
Finally completed.

238
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:50,097
Turned upside down in haste.

239
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:55,797
Did you catch cold, Conan?

240
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:59,597
No, it's cat hair! There are so many all over here.

241
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:00,797
Cat?

242
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:04,597
Come to think of it, Mr. Manda let his cat roam here for a while

243
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:06,197
even during investigation.

244
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:08,897
That's why there's so much cat hair here.

245
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:10,697
Mr. Manda's not very nice, is he?

246
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:13,097
Oh? What do you mean?

247
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:15,497
Because he heard the sound of something cracking,

248
00:13:15,497 --> 00:13:19,597
so he came outside to look and saw us go into the house.

249
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:21,797
That's why he came after us, right?

250
00:13:21,797 --> 00:13:24,497
If I were him, I wouldn't bring the cat here,

251
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:26,997
and even if I did bring the cat, I would carry it all the while.

252
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:31,597
The kitty may after all, hurt itself with the thing that cracked.

253
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:35,897
Yeah, it kind of seems like he let the cat go on purpose.

254
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:38,197
He let the cat go on purpose?

255
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:42,697
Detective Yako Hyakki grinning her tightly pursed lips

256
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,197
and started to reveal the case.

257
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:55,097
She of course had the police detective speak in her place.

258
00:13:57,197 --> 00:13:58,797
So, this is it.

259
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:05,697
So, you're finally here. What took you so long?

260
00:14:05,697 --> 00:14:09,997
I'm sorry, my hands were somewhat tied.

261
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:13,097
Getting right down to business, please tell me, will you?

262
00:14:13,097 --> 00:14:15,597
About the detective story you thought up, Sensei.

263
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:17,497
You've already started writing it, haven't you?

264
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:20,797
Yeah, the fact is, it's written up to almost the last part

265
00:14:20,797 --> 00:14:23,197
but I'm stuck on how the ending should be

266
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:27,097
since the detective herself is the victim of the murder.

267
00:14:27,097 --> 00:14:28,297
What?

268
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:29,497
Yeah,

269
00:14:29,497 --> 00:14:33,297
the woman lawyer who is killed at the beginning of the story

270
00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:35,797
appears as a ghost and possesses her best friend who is a detective

271
00:14:35,797 --> 00:14:39,097
and discloses the truth of the case.

272
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:42,297
Oh, that sounds interesting.

273
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:44,597
The name of the character playing the woman lawyer-detective

274
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:46,197
is Yako Hyakki.

275
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:47,997
Great name, isn't it?

276
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,297
Who could it be at this time of night?

277
00:14:53,097 --> 00:14:55,597
Inspector.

278
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:57,197
I'm sorry, but could you wait until our discussion is over

279
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,697
if you need to talk to me?

280
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:02,097
No, we'll need you to talk to us,

281
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:04,297
because we've finally figured it out.

282
00:15:04,297 --> 00:15:05,797
You've figured it out?

283
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:07,397
You mean who the murderer is?

284
00:15:07,397 --> 00:15:08,497
Yes.

285
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:12,597
The one who killed Mr. Haramoto is you, Mr. Manda!

286
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:14,197
Huh?

287
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:16,297
It sure was a surprise,

288
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:19,797
that the novelist Mr. Manda was the killer.

289
00:15:19,797 --> 00:15:21,497
But, wasn't Mr. Manda

290
00:15:21,497 --> 00:15:24,397
confined to the room in that hotel from last night,

291
00:15:24,397 --> 00:15:26,397
and during the time the murder was committed at about 3pm,

292
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:28,097
wasn't he in the room?

293
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:29,897
The editor, Mr. Shimaki

294
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:32,897
couldn't have been watching in front of the door all the while,

295
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:34,997
so Mr. Manda probably snuck out of the room

296
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:37,397
disguised as a bellboy or something.

297
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:40,897
Then, with a bicycle or something that he had prepared beforehand,

298
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:43,597
and rushed over to Mr. Haramoto's house.

299
00:15:43,597 --> 00:15:46,897
Then, he snuck up from behind and hit him with the flower vase.

300
00:15:46,897 --> 00:15:49,097
His alibi was supposed to be established

301
00:15:49,097 --> 00:15:51,597
after rushing back to the hotel,

302
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,597
but a problem came up.

303
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:56,297
Yes, the cat that you brought along

304
00:15:56,297 --> 00:16:01,197
disappeared in the room next to the murder site.

305
00:16:01,197 --> 00:16:04,897
You panicked and looked for him but he wouldn't come out,

306
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:08,097
and that's when you remembered that

307
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:12,097
Mr. Haramoto had told you that his collection was finally completed

308
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,597
and that he was happy.

309
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:17,397
You live right opposite Mr. Haramoto.

310
00:16:17,397 --> 00:16:19,197
If you leave the backdoor open,

311
00:16:19,197 --> 00:16:23,497
the cat would come back on its own if it gets hungry.

312
00:16:23,497 --> 00:16:26,697
But if before that the cat walks around

313
00:16:26,697 --> 00:16:31,197
and cat hair is found on the collection that was just completed today,

314
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:35,497
it would serve as proof that you had come to the room today.

315
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:36,797
After all, the cat as well as yourself

316
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:40,797
were supposed to be confined in the hotel room from last night.

317
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:43,497
That's when you came upon the idea of

318
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:45,697
turning all of Mr. Haramoto's collection upside

319
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:48,797
and making the housekeeper, Ms. Ichimura who will come in two hours

320
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:52,597
straighten everything out, so that the cat hair will fall to the floor.

321
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:54,597
But, will just turning everything upside down

322
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,997
make cat hair come off that easily?

323
00:16:56,997 --> 00:16:58,997
It doesn't really matter,

324
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:02,897
so long as Ms. Ichimura testifies that she turned them back up.

325
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,997
Because the cat hair that's on the floor

326
00:17:04,997 --> 00:17:06,697
could've got on to the collection

327
00:17:06,697 --> 00:17:08,597
while she was returning the collection right side up.

328
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:11,697
But, I wonder why he did something so bothersome

329
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,897
as to turn everything upside down.

330
00:17:13,897 --> 00:17:17,397
If it were me, I would just drop everything to the floor.

331
00:17:17,397 --> 00:17:20,297
That wouldn't look like mischief, would it?

332
00:17:20,297 --> 00:17:21,997
If she thinks that a thief entered the house

333
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:25,397
and called the police, that would be it, right?

334
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:30,897
But, we found it before the housekeeper came.

335
00:17:30,897 --> 00:17:34,697
Right, so I'm sure Mr. Manda was really flustered.

336
00:17:34,697 --> 00:17:37,397
That's why he had to think even deeper.

337
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:40,797
When he saw us go into the house,

338
00:17:40,797 --> 00:17:42,097
Mr. Manda on the spur of the moment carried his cat

339
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:43,497
and ran over right away.

340
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,997
Then, he let the cat go in that room.

341
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:47,497
So that nobody would be able to tell

342
00:17:47,497 --> 00:17:49,097
when the cat hair scattered all over the place.

343
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:53,897
I see! That's why he got angry when I tried to touch the cat.

344
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:57,497
If the police came while I was carrying the cat,

345
00:17:57,497 --> 00:17:59,297
his whole plan would've gone to waste.

346
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:04,497
But, he succeeded in getting rid of the evidence.

347
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:08,097
With no proof, he could say it's just your imagination.

348
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:11,297
Yeah, but I left bait behind.

349
00:18:12,697 --> 00:18:15,097
That's terrific deduction, Inspector.

350
00:18:15,097 --> 00:18:19,397
I'd recommend that you write a mystery novel.

351
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:25,397
But, where's the proof? You can't arrest me without it.

352
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:28,897
Of course, I'm not the killer though.

353
00:18:28,897 --> 00:18:32,397
I'll make use of this in my next detective story...

354
00:18:32,397 --> 00:18:37,297
There were detective stories in Mr. Haramoto's computer too.

355
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:39,897
The unfinished mystery story

356
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:43,697
of ghost detective Yako Hyakki, the main character!

357
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:46,897
We asked for Editor Shimaki's cooperation,

358
00:18:46,897 --> 00:18:50,597
and set a microphone on his clothes.

359
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,797
What we heard through the microphone of your next story

360
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:55,197
also had to do with a ghost detective by the name of Yako Hyakki.

361
00:18:55,197 --> 00:19:00,397
That's why I told you, didn't I? That he took care of all my works.

362
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:02,497
Oh, that's right.

363
00:19:02,497 --> 00:19:05,297
Were you the one who wrote all of it?

364
00:19:05,297 --> 00:19:07,297
Well, of course.

365
00:19:07,297 --> 00:19:08,997
To be honest,

366
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:12,197
the children who were playing around with the computer found it.

367
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:14,797
The children and my men were reading it till a while ago,

368
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:17,697
hoping it would give us some clue.

369
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:19,697
I'm ashamed to say, there is something I cannot understand that

370
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:21,797
I would like you to tell me about.

371
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:25,197
Who is the killer and what kind of trick was used?

372
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,597
That's...

373
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:33,397
I don't mind if you'd show me the disc case with that story in it.

374
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:36,797
The disc case that you stole from Mr. Haramoto's desk,

375
00:19:36,797 --> 00:19:40,097
the one with what looks to be his blood on the case.

376
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:42,997
You should've been reading it till just a while ago!

377
00:19:42,997 --> 00:19:46,997
After you came back from the hotel till the time you found Mr. Haramoto,

378
00:19:46,997 --> 00:19:49,097
and when you got home just a while ago,

379
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:50,997
you were with the editor right through

380
00:19:50,997 --> 00:19:53,497
and wouldn't have had time to read it at all!

381
00:19:53,497 --> 00:19:57,697
Despite this, you explained the story to Mr. Shimaki just a while ago!

382
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,797
Don't tell that the boy...

383
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:02,197
I can't wait to read it.

384
00:20:02,197 --> 00:20:05,097
I wonder if it's in Mr. Haramoto's computer.

385
00:20:05,097 --> 00:20:07,497
He set it up so that the novel would be read

386
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,697
before I got to hide the disc that is evidence.

387
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:14,797
That disc and case are in your room, aren't they?

388
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:19,497
Sensei!

389
00:20:22,797 --> 00:20:25,297
I'm no longer a Sensei.

390
00:20:25,297 --> 00:20:27,897
I'm just a plain aged man, who lost his wife

391
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:30,397
and have no energy left to do anything.

392
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:35,997
All my stories for the last 2 to 3 years were written by Mr. Haramoto.

393
00:20:35,997 --> 00:20:40,897
Of course, I did a lot of fixing at the start.

394
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:43,397
But, he gradually started disliking me fixing his story,

395
00:20:43,397 --> 00:20:47,097
and lately I haven't been able to say a thing about his works.

396
00:20:47,097 --> 00:20:48,797
Then, finally...

397
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:50,197
Please leave everything up to me,

398
00:20:50,197 --> 00:20:53,497
while you sit in the audience already,

399
00:20:53,497 --> 00:20:56,897
since you've already passed over your baton.

400
00:20:58,097 --> 00:21:00,697
I just couldn't forgive those words of his,

401
00:21:00,697 --> 00:21:04,397
because they were so sad and so vexing.

402
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,997
Then, why did you steal his detective story?

403
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:09,997
I suddenly came up with the idea

404
00:21:09,997 --> 00:21:14,097
that I could probably write better than he can.

405
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:16,497
But, I lost.

406
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:17,897
No matter how hard I think,

407
00:21:17,897 --> 00:21:21,497
I could never figure out who the killer or what the trick is.

408
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:26,497
I guess I was never cut out to write mysteries.

409
00:22:53,797 --> 00:22:57,497
Oh, the conversation with the housekeeper.

410
00:22:57,497 --> 00:23:00,097
Yeah, when she tried to talk about the detective

411
00:23:00,097 --> 00:23:02,397
that Mr. Haramoto thought up,

412
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:05,197
Mr. Manda interrupted her.

413
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:07,797
That's when I hit upon the idea that maybe he stole Mr. Haramoto's story.

414
00:23:07,797 --> 00:23:09,797
But, there's still a mystery left.

415
00:23:09,797 --> 00:23:12,097
Huh? The killer in that novel is...

416
00:23:12,097 --> 00:23:13,497
No, not that.

417
00:23:13,497 --> 00:23:16,697
About the collection that Mr. Haramoto said he finally completed.

418
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:18,197
Oh, that?

419
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,997
He was probably talking about his teeth.

420
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:21,497
What?

421
00:23:21,497 --> 00:23:23,197
Ms. Ichimura the housekeeper said that

422
00:23:23,197 --> 00:23:27,597
Mr. Haramoto had told her to make a dentist appointment for him today.

423
00:23:27,597 --> 00:23:30,497
Remember the mirror that was in the desk?

424
00:23:30,497 --> 00:23:32,297
I think that Mr. Haramoto was looking at his teeth

425
00:23:32,297 --> 00:23:35,397
that were finally nicely in place at the time he was struck.

426
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:37,897
Besides, one of the pieces of the flower vase

427
00:23:37,897 --> 00:23:40,297
that was found in the drawer

428
00:23:40,297 --> 00:23:41,997
was a crown.

429
00:23:41,997 --> 00:23:43,497
What?

430
00:23:43,497 --> 00:23:47,697
Why didn't you tell something important like that to Inspector Megure?

431
00:23:47,697 --> 00:23:50,497
Because I already figured out who the killer was

432
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:53,497
and besides, this had nothing to do with the case.

433
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:56,797
That's why it doesn't matter.

434
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:06,251
Warning of murder?

435
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:12,451
The novelist was killed by a character that appears in her novel?

436
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,451
To complicate investigations?

437
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:17,551
I wonder if anyone would do something like this just for that purpose.

438
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:23,951
Next Conan,

439
00:24:23,951 --> 00:24:27,951
"My Favorite Mystery"

440
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:45,651
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,851
"Marinated ginger slices from a sushi shop"

442
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:49,151
What kind of fish is a "gari"?

443
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:50,951
Oh come on, that's what marinated ginger slices are called.

444
00:24:50,951 --> 00:24:52,951
Really, a moronic gink.
