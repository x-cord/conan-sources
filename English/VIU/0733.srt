1
00:00:13,974 --> 00:00:16,074
Congratulations, Masaru.

2
00:00:16,074 --> 00:00:17,874
Congratulations.

3
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:45,074
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

4
00:00:45,074 --> 00:00:46,974
are slashed by the light of deduction.

5
00:00:46,974 --> 00:00:48,874
Gunshots fired at the bride and groom.

6
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:50,774
Solve the mystery of the impossible crime.

7
00:00:50,774 --> 00:00:52,374
He sees through the one and only truth.

8
00:00:52,374 --> 00:00:54,274
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

9
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:56,874
His name is Detective Conan!

10
00:02:26,443 --> 00:02:31,643
"The Wedding Reception and Two Gunshots"

11
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:47,543
The food is pretty good.

12
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:51,443
But, I wonder if it was really okay for people like us

13
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:54,043
who don't know them at all to come here?

14
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:56,243
It's okay, it's okay.

15
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,043
If I came here alone,

16
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:00,643
what table do you think I would've had to sit at?

17
00:03:00,643 --> 00:03:03,843
All the ladies and gentlemen are pert...

18
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:05,643
Besides if I come to a place like this alone,

19
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:09,843
people who want to introduce their sons,

20
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:12,943
approach me one after the other,

21
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,643
I wouldn't be able to enjoy my meal.

22
00:03:17,843 --> 00:03:20,743
The daughter of a financially wealthy family has it tough too.

23
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:24,343
Right. I'm sure that Yu experienced the same thing too.

24
00:03:24,343 --> 00:03:25,843
To think that he would fall in love at first sight

25
00:03:25,843 --> 00:03:28,143
"Masaru Hatakeyama (28), Groom" -with a woman who was working

26
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:30,743
"Miho Ito (26), Bride" -as a manager of the villa.

27
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,843
-How romantic. -How romantic.

28
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:38,343
Ladies and gentlemen,

29
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,043
I hate to stop you in the middle of your cheerful chatting.

30
00:03:41,043 --> 00:03:45,843
I would like the guests to present their speeches now,

31
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:49,643
but before that I have an announcement to make.

32
00:03:50,643 --> 00:03:54,743
Although the groom, Masaru and his bride Miho went through

33
00:03:54,743 --> 00:03:58,943
a solemn marriage ceremony at the church just a while ago.

34
00:03:58,943 --> 00:04:02,043
The fact is, they have already submitted their marriage certificate

35
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:04,043
to the city hall the day before yesterday.

36
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,843
What?

37
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:07,843
Did you know about it, mother?

38
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:11,143
"Yuko Hatakeyama (62), Mother of the groom" -No, I didn't know either.

39
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:13,443
How dare they do something like that on their own.

40
00:04:13,443 --> 00:04:18,243
Ladies and gentlemen, please give them a big hand once again.

41
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:24,943
Geez.

42
00:04:24,943 --> 00:04:26,243
There's no more wine.

43
00:04:26,243 --> 00:04:27,343
"Kenshiro Hatakeyama (64)" -Hey, Alisa!

44
00:04:27,343 --> 00:04:28,543
"Masaru's uncle" -You're drinking too much!

45
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,943
"Alisa Hatakeyama (25), Masaru's cousin" -Shut up.

46
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:33,543
I came here only because you insisted that I come here, Dad!

47
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:37,343
I guess she was one of the girls that wanted to be Masaru's bride too.

48
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:40,543
Excuse me, you want wine?

49
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:42,643
I'll go get one for you.

50
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:45,143
Yoshibumi.

51
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:47,543
"Tatsuya Ishihara (37)" -You're the younger brother of the bride,

52
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:49,743
"Masaru's brother-in-law" -let someone else do it.

53
00:04:49,743 --> 00:04:53,043
"Yoshibumi Ito (25)" -No, I'm not at home at places like this.

54
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:57,143
"Miho's younger brother" -I feel more comfortable moving around.

55
00:04:57,143 --> 00:05:01,843
He should at least stay still in place at least today.

56
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,343
A manager of a villa can be nothing more than a manger after all.

57
00:05:05,343 --> 00:05:06,643
"Rikako Ishihara (34), Masaru's older sister" -I tell you.

58
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:08,743
To think that a woman like her

59
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:11,143
gets to use the assets of the Hatakeyama family at will.

60
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:14,243
I'm sure dad is crying in sadness from his grave.

61
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:19,343
Then, here is a speech from the Uncle of the groom,

62
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:23,443
president of the Hatakeyama Bank, Mr. Kenshiro Hatakeyama

63
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:25,243
wishing the couple happiness.

64
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:30,043
What's the matter, Conan?

65
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:31,443
I've got to go to the restroom.

66
00:05:36,543 --> 00:05:37,543
Sonny.

67
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:39,643
What's the matter?

68
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:40,843
Are you looking for the restroom?

69
00:05:40,843 --> 00:05:41,843
Yes.

70
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:43,343
Do you know where it is?

71
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,243
I'm fine.

72
00:05:45,243 --> 00:05:47,643
You came together with the girl

73
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:49,843
from the Suzuki Financial Group, didn't you?

74
00:05:49,843 --> 00:05:54,643
Yes. You're the manager for this villa, aren't you, sir?

75
00:05:54,643 --> 00:05:55,643
Yes.

76
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:59,843
My mother and father were managers of the villa here

77
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:02,243
when it was first built.

78
00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:05,943
But, they both died in an accident.

79
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:08,243
What were they doing before that?

80
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,643
They owned a farm.

81
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:13,943
But, this area was plagued with disasters caused by monkeys and boars,

82
00:06:13,943 --> 00:06:18,043
they quit the farm and became managers for the villa.

83
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:21,843
Weren't you going to the restroom, sonny?

84
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:23,243
I forgot!

85
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:24,243
See you.

86
00:06:31,543 --> 00:06:32,843
Of course I can.

87
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:34,943
Hi, there.

88
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:38,043
Do you like the food?

89
00:06:38,043 --> 00:06:41,443
Yes, I've eaten to my heart's content.

90
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,243
I'm glad.

91
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:46,243
When we return from our honeymoon,

92
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:49,443
why don't you three come over to our house in Tokyo.

93
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,343
Of course we will,

94
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:53,143
but don't forget to bring us back souvenirs.

95
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:56,443
Okay, I'll remember to do that.

96
00:06:56,443 --> 00:06:59,343
Shouldn't you be looking after the bride?

97
00:06:59,343 --> 00:07:02,943
Staying by two beauties like us may get her jealous.

98
00:07:03,943 --> 00:07:06,243
No, I won't.

99
00:07:06,243 --> 00:07:08,343
Because I trust Masaru, you see.

100
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:10,643
Wow, hot, hot.

101
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:14,343
Miho, you don't look too well?

102
00:07:14,343 --> 00:07:17,443
Yes. I'm a bit tired.

103
00:07:17,443 --> 00:07:19,843
Then, you can leave the rest to me.

104
00:07:19,843 --> 00:07:22,243
I think you'd better go back to the hotel and rest.

105
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:24,143
-Yoshibumi. -Yes, sir.

106
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,743
Do you drink?

107
00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:28,143
No, I can't drink.

108
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:32,343
Then, will you drive Miho to the hotel in my car?

109
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:33,343
Yes, sir.

110
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:45,843
Shall we get going too?

111
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:47,043
I guess so.

112
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:49,643
Then, let's say bye to Masaru.

113
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:51,443
Where's Masaru?

114
00:07:51,443 --> 00:07:52,943
He said he got a call from Miho

115
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:55,943
and went out about 10 minutes ago.

116
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:57,743
Bad news.

117
00:07:58,743 --> 00:08:00,243
What's the matter?

118
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:03,543
The parking lot where the wagon is...

119
00:08:03,543 --> 00:08:06,043
The groom is lying on the ground!

120
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:07,343
What?

121
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:08,343
No joke?

122
00:08:09,343 --> 00:08:11,043
-What? -It can't be.

123
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:24,543
He's been shot at point blank range.

124
00:08:24,543 --> 00:08:26,343
Masaru!

125
00:08:26,343 --> 00:08:27,643
Hold it!

126
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:29,943
Don't go near him till the police arrive!

127
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:30,943
Conan.

128
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,543
Ran.

129
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:34,043
Call the police right away!

130
00:08:34,043 --> 00:08:35,443
Yes!

131
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:38,943
Is it true that Masaru's lying on the ground?

132
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:40,043
Uncle.

133
00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:44,643
What's that sound?

134
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:46,643
It seems to have come from the other side of the river.

135
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:49,143
Yes, it came from the hotel side.

136
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:50,243
Don't tell me...

137
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,943
Miho! Miho!

138
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,439
I see.

139
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:29,239
Then, when you heard that gunshot like sound,

140
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:33,639
those who are here now, except for Conan, were all here back then too?

141
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,339
Yes, sir. We got a call from,

142
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:40,039
Conan telling us to all wait here for the police to arrive.

143
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:43,539
Okay, let's go to the other site.

144
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:44,539
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

145
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,439
What are you doing, Officer Takagi?

146
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,739
I'm searching to see if I can find the belongings of the perp.

147
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:13,939
I've found it!

148
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:18,639
There seems to be no mistake that this is the murder weapon.

149
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,339
Excuse me! Will you take a picture of this?

150
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:25,239
Bamboo?

151
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:27,239
Why would something like this be here?

152
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:32,739
Tatsuya, I hate to say something like this

153
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:34,639
at a time like this but...

154
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,239
What's going to happen to the stocks that Masaru owns?

155
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:42,039
I'm really worried about the employees getting worried over it.

156
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:45,239
Well, he has no children,

157
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:47,839
so there's no doubt that his siblings,

158
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,639
that is, mother and I get to have it.

159
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:55,039
No. If Masaru dies before Miho,

160
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:57,139
all the estate that Masaru owns,

161
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:01,239
at the moment he dies should fall into Miho's hands.

162
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,739
Just what do you mean?

163
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:05,439
Didn't you hear what the MC said last night?

164
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:08,539
The two are already married.

165
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:12,039
Then, what happens to Masaru's estate?

166
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,439
If Miho died after Masaru,

167
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:17,239
then the estate would go to the one

168
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:20,739
who has the right to inherit her estate.

169
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:23,939
Oh no. That's ridiculous.

170
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:27,339
I won't ever approve of something like that!

171
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:31,139
Approve or not, it's the law.

172
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:34,239
There can't be such a ridiculous law!

173
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,439
I'm sorry to have asked you to gather here at a time like this.

174
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:44,639
Mother's extremely shocked,

175
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,039
we're letting her rest in her room.

176
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,639
I understand.

177
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,139
Out of all the participants last night,

178
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:53,339
we've sent everyone who had a definite alibi

179
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,839
at the estimated time of death of both victims home.

180
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,539
Are you suspecting us?

181
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:03,139
No, it's just that you all are very closely connected

182
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,639
to the two who have passed away.

183
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,639
I understand you being upset,

184
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,239
but, we'd like to ask for your cooperation.

185
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:17,939
Tatsuya and I were near Masaru's corpse at the time Miho was killed.

186
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:21,639
We have alibis as far as Miho's death is concerned.

187
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,239
Yes, the bullets that were removed from the bodies of the two,

188
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:31,139
were both fired from the gun that was found in the garden.

189
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:36,439
In other words, we think that the same perp committed both crimes.

190
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:37,939
Which means that we...

191
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:41,339
But, during that time, Rika and Alisa,

192
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,039
you both were back at the hotel, weren't you?

193
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,339
Are you saying that I'm the murderer?

194
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:48,939
Well, well, please don't get excited.

195
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:51,639
We're just talking of probabilities.

196
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,339
Since it's just been a short while since the incident,

197
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:57,039
we have no idea of the motive of the perp

198
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:59,639
who killed the bride and groom one after the other.

199
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,339
I'd like to ask you,

200
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:06,139
Yoshibumi, younger brother of the bride.

201
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:07,739
Yes

202
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:11,739
According to our investigations from last night up to now,

203
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:14,139
you seem to be in debt of a few million yen

204
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:17,339
from several money lenders.

205
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:20,939
Well, that's...

206
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:25,539
Please tell me if you do or not.

207
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:28,139
Yes, it's true that I do.

208
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,239
But, I didn't kill anybody.

209
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:33,639
Why should I kill my older sister?

210
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:36,339
She's the only family I have.

211
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:42,439
Officer Chiba, what are you doing?

212
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:43,739
Conan.

213
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,239
I was checking the surveillance camera.

214
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:50,039
Because if it's the camera set up on the inside of the entrance,

215
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,539
the area around the garden should be included, right?

216
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:57,639
That's why I was looking at all the recordings from last night

217
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,339
but no one seems to have come near the garden.

218
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,939
Then why was the gun found there?

219
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:07,739
Maybe it was thrown from the top window of the hotel.

220
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:18,139
What're these four dents?

221
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:28,139
Last night, I got a call saying

222
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,339
that the streetlight over there was out.

223
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:32,439
Did you see something back then?

224
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,239
Now that you mentioned it...

225
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:45,939
At about what time was that?

226
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,739
I think it was about...

227
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:53,639
I got the call about 9:40 pm,

228
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,339
so I think it was about 9:45 pm.

229
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,139
9:45 pm?

230
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:00,939
What on earth does that mean?

231
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:04,339
9:45 pm...

232
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:07,239
That's almost right after Miho left the villa.

233
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,239
That's 30 minutes before we found Masaru's corpse.

234
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,139
So, that's the story.

235
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:22,439
But if so, what about that...

236
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:23,739
Hey, sonny.

237
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:28,139
A child shouldn't be walking around outside so late at night.

238
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:29,939
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:33,039
There are a lot of hungry monkeys around here

240
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,739
so you'll get bitten, you know!

241
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:39,339
I see. If that's used...

242
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:42,339
We have no reason to kill Masaru!

243
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:44,539
I'll bet you deep down inside you were planning

244
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:46,239
to push Masaru out of the way

245
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:48,539
so that your hubby could get to the top of the Hatakeyama group.

246
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:50,439
I know about it, you see!

247
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:53,839
Don't be ridiculous, you stupid lass.

248
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,339
I'll bet you were vexed not being able to be Masaru's bride.

249
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:59,039
On top of that, when Masaru saw what you did

250
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,639
to Miho you also killed him, isn't that right?

251
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,339
I wonder who's the stupider one!

252
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:05,239
Masaru was killed first, you know.

253
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:08,239
Did greed send you out of your mind?

254
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:13,739
How unsightly, cut it out!

255
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,739
-Inspector Megure. -Yes.

256
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:19,439
We're going home...

257
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,639
Sonoko? Don't tell me the usual's come?

258
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,039
I don't want to butt into other people's business,

259
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,139
but if I keep my mouth shut,

260
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:32,639
the one who's going to be most delighted is the perp, right?

261
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,439
Sonoko, are you saying that you've figured out who the perp is?

262
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:39,739
Right.

263
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:42,839
If the police did their job like they should have,

264
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,239
I didn't have to stick my nose in, you see.

265
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:50,939
Rikako you said one thing that's right.

266
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:55,239
Miho was killed first.

267
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,439
What?

268
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:59,039
But, the only people who returned to the hotel

269
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,039
before everyone else are Rikako and Alisa.

270
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,039
I'm telling you, I didn't do it!

271
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,839
Neither did I!

272
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,339
I know it's not you two.

273
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:09,839
The time the crime was committed

274
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,939
was right after Miho returned to the cottage.

275
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,139
That's why she didn't change clothes.

276
00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:21,239
You probably drove Miho over by car and killed her right there, no?

277
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,639
Yoshibumi?

278
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:26,239
Just what're you talking about?

279
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:29,839
You have a lot of debts.

280
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,039
When your older sister got married,

281
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:35,039
you thought that you'd be able to repay your debts,

282
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,639
but things didn't go as you expected.

283
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:42,739
That's why you put something inside your sister's drink.

284
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:46,639
You took her to the cottage after she started feeling sick

285
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:49,839
and killed her with the gun that you had hidden

286
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,439
muffling the sound with a cushion or something.

287
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:57,639
After that you called Masaru out using Miho's cell phone,

288
00:17:57,639 --> 00:18:00,539
and killed him just as you did Miho.

289
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:04,639
Wait a minute please.

290
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:07,039
What about the gun that was the murder weapon?

291
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,339
It was found in the garden of the hotel, wasn't it?

292
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:14,139
I was with all of you and Masaru till the police arrived, wasn't I?

293
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:17,239
I didn't have time to get rid of the gun.

294
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:20,039
That's what bothered me the most.

295
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:23,439
Why did the perp dispose of the gun in a place like that?

296
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,339
But, I figured it out.

297
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,239
The gun wasn't disposed of there,

298
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:31,239
but rather, that it just fell there.

299
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:34,439
The villa and the hotel are located

300
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:37,439
almost completely opposite each other with the river between them.

301
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,839
But, after killing Masaru,

302
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,539
it would be humanly impossible to throw the gun to the opposite bank.

303
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,939
So that's when you used that...

304
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:55,839
Why would I do something like that?

305
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,439
Why not?

306
00:18:57,439 --> 00:19:00,139
Didn't Rikako and the others just say a while ago?

307
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,539
In order to make it look as if Masaru's estate

308
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,239
is once inherited by Miho,

309
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:10,739
it had to look as if Miho had died after Masaru did at all costs.

310
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:11,839
In order for it to look that way,

311
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,739
the gun needed to be found on this side of the river no matter what.

312
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,839
That's only your imagination.

313
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,839
Do you have proof?

314
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,739
Don't you remember seeing a man holding a ladder?

315
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:27,439
The hotel employee man who came to fix the fluorescent light

316
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:29,939
in front of cottage,

317
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:34,139
saw a silhouette of a figure come bursting out of that room.

318
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,839
And, that was before Masaru was killed.

319
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:41,439
In other words, Miho was the one who was killed first.

320
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:46,039
Then, what about the gunshot that everyone heard at the parking lot?

321
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:49,939
That gunshot was indeed the pinnacle of the alibi

322
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,239
you established by racking your brains.

323
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:55,439
Please come in.

324
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,539
You remember seeing this, don't you?

325
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,939
It was found in the shed of your house.

326
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:04,639
There's no reason you don't.

327
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:07,239
What's that?

328
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,039
A Suzume Odoshi.

329
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,039
It keeps away sparrows that come to eat rice grains in autumn

330
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:15,639
using fireworks.

331
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:20,039
It seems that this is used to keep monkeys away in this area.

332
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:23,339
While I'm at it,

333
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:26,739
I might as well let you know that it was set go sound only once.

334
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:29,939
The sound that you all heard was this.

335
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:33,539
Darn.

336
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,939
Sis, is to blame.

337
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:39,939
She became a member of the family who has assets of so many billions

338
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:43,239
and yet says that she plans to give me nothing.

339
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:46,339
Have you heard of such a ruthless story?

340
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:21,439
Ran is completely had it.

341
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:23,439
Well, after something like that happening,

342
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:25,739
I guess it's only natural.

343
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:28,739
Ran, let's have something good to eat tonight,

344
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:30,139
and cheer up.

345
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:32,739
I'll make you dinner if you like.

346
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:35,439
I watched a TV program some days ago

347
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:39,739
explaining how to make great tasting curry!

348
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:44,439
No, no. Don't be silly, curry is a high calorie food.

349
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,239
After such a sad incident at the wedding,

350
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:51,039
I weighed myself when I got home

351
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,239
and found that I gained 2 kg. Isn't it shocking?

352
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,639
Two kilograms, you know!

353
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:59,239
That's why she was depressed?

354
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:01,139
Ran!

355
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:04,139
-Good morning. -Good morning.

356
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:07,939
Sonoko, you don't look too happy.

357
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:11,039
Listen to this. I got home from the wedding

358
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,039
and weighed myself to find that I gained 3 kg.

359
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,739
I gained 2 kg.

360
00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:18,139
I've got to somehow lose weight by summer.

361
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:20,239
Or we won't be able to wear swimsuits.

362
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:24,739
But you're going to be weighed at school before that, aren't you?

363
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,439
Ran, what shall we do?

364
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,939
Exercise. Let's run, Sonoko!

365
00:23:30,939 --> 00:23:32,239
Here goes!

366
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:35,239
Well, well.

367
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:38,039
I lost weight from worry.

368
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,139
The cherry blossoms are in full bloom.

369
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:44,539
It's indeed a day for flower viewing.

370
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:45,939
"Super lucky"

371
00:23:45,939 --> 00:23:47,539
Super lucky?

372
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:51,339
Bad news, Shinichi!

373
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:52,539
It's a homicide!

374
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:56,139
It seems that I've witnessed a murder!

375
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,839
A 5 yen coin painted black with a Sharpie...

376
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,839
Kurobei!

377
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,739
Next Conan Special,

378
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:09,139
"Tribute to Jodie and the Flower Viewing Trap".
