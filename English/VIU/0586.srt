1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,070
Giraffe's horn.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,170
It is the amber horn of a giraffe statue that advisor

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,670
Jirokichi Suzuki found in the main building

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,470
of a mountain temple.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,070
That Thief Kid who puts on airs is after this treasure

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,570
and sends Jirokichi a forewarning

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,770
letter of his intent to steal this.

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,870
The advisor takes us,

9
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,670
the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,170
whom he figures Thief Kid cannot disguise himself as,

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,770
along with the TV crew,

12
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,070
and is all out to capture Thief Kid.

13
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,570
In order to get it you have to insert keys

14
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,070
into each pedestal that is in

15
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,870
all four corners of the room

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,970
and turn the keys all at that same time.

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,970
Okay. Come whenever you like, Thief Kid.

18
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,470
I'm going to get you for sure this time.

19
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,870
Brooding over passing seasons,

20
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,770
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

21
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,570
The treasure that vanished and Thief Kid.

22
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,870
Youth Detective Squad, catch him without Conan's help.

23
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,470
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,270
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,570
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

26
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:57,028
"Giraffe Horn that Vanished in the Dark"

27
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:05,639
-Okay, close it. -Yes, sir!

28
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,239
Like so... If you don't turn all four keys

29
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,439
of the four pedestal at the same time,

30
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,039
you cannot view the statue of the giraffe.

31
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,239
-What? -In other words, unless he

32
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:25,139
steals these keys from me

33
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,939
and split himself into four,

34
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:30,339
he can't take it away from me.

35
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:33,539
Don't tell me that the person who made this is...

36
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:36,039
Of course, the master of tricks during the days of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

37
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:39,439
Kichiemon Samizu, right?

38
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,739
Yes.

39
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,339
It's written at the foot of the pillar.

40
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:45,339
"One who desires to acquire the giraffe

41
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:47,539
without using the correct method,

42
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:49,539
must move with the flow."

43
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:51,939
Kichiemon Samizu.

44
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:53,639
Did you figure out what this means?

45
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,739
No. Not yet.

46
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,439
So long as I have these four keys,

47
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,639
everything will be all right.

48
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,239
He can't steal them from me.

49
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:05,339
What an easy-going old man.

50
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:08,339
If three of his accomplices are among the people here,

51
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:09,439
and black this place out,

52
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,439
all they'd have left to do is to steal the keys.

53
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,739
That's true.

54
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:17,139
Thief Kid could black this make-shift lighting

55
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:20,739
out in no time at all.

56
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:22,239
Yes.

57
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:24,239
Even the electric shock current going through the pedestals

58
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:26,639
would be easily cut off

59
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,639
if we have only four people to guard

60
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,039
the keyholes of the pedestal in the dark...

61
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,139
But, I can't say for sure either when any of my men

62
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:37,339
would be switched with Thief Kid.

63
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:40,739
I can't trust the three TV crew either.

64
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,639
Darn! If there was only one keyhole,

65
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:46,539
I would guard over my dead body.

66
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:49,039
We'll guard it for you then.

67
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,039
Thief Kid can't disguise himself as us.

68
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:55,039
We can be most trusted.

69
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,039
And if we protect the treasure on our own,

70
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,739
we can show Conan that we're pretty good ourselves.

71
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:05,239
Right.

72
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:07,239
But, can you really handle it?

73
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:09,739
If you touch the pedestal before the electricity

74
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:11,639
is cut off, you'll get shocked.

75
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,739
We'll be fine.

76
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:15,139
So long as we don't mess up the order.

77
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:16,339
Each time it beeps,

78
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:18,039
it's suppose to cut off in the order of green, red,

79
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,139
white and black, right?

80
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:23,739
That's right, don't mess up.

81
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,539
So, it's only 10 more minutes to go

82
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:26,939
before the time Thief Kid promised he'll be appearing.

83
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:28,839
Will Thief Kid really show up in this mountain temple

84
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:32,239
where the members of the Youth Detective Squad await him?

85
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:35,139
Okay, we're all going to work together and capture Thief Kid!

86
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,939
Okay!

87
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:39,639
Conan and the others are really on TV.

88
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,339
How lucky.

89
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:43,439
You guys should've gone too.

90
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,039
Uncle Jirokichi told us not to come. He said,

91
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,339
"Only the children get to come over this time.

92
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:53,339
Since Thief Kid can disguise into both of you, don't come!" right?

93
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,839
Take Five.

94
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,239
We'll have to stand by from 3 minutes before,

95
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,239
so be ready, okay?

96
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:03,539
-Okay! -Got you.

97
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,939
We'll stand by too.

98
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,339
Right!

99
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:09,539
Hey! Where are you guys going?

100
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,539
We're going to guard the pedestal.

101
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:12,839
The problem is whether

102
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,739
or not you can guard the keys though.

103
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:18,139
No need to worry about that.

104
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,039
Since they're nailed onto the wall like this,

105
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:26,339
he couldn't possibly lay a hand on them,

106
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:28,039
so I win.

107
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,339
Black-out?

108
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:33,839
No need to fret.

109
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,839
A black out was expected to begin with.

110
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,539
Wind and rain, did someone open the window?

111
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,339
Is the camera rolling?

112
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:45,239
Yes, but it's so dark, practically nothing is in view.

113
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,939
-How's the sound? -I'm picking it up somehow.

114
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,739
It can't be.

115
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:04,239
What's this sound?

116
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,339
The pillar?

117
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,339
Conan.

118
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,739
Conan!

119
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:19,239
Get a hold of yourself!

120
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,839
Conan?

121
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:27,039
The giraffe's...

122
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,739
The giraffe's horn is gone.

123
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:32,939
Conan!

124
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:35,039
Conan.

125
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,639
Please open your eyes.

126
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,339
Conan.

127
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,739
What's taking you so long?

128
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:41,939
Can't you get the lights back on yet?

129
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,339
Cool it! Everybody stay where you are!

130
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,839
Hey, what is going on?

131
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,339
Is Thief Kid here or what?

132
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:50,439
I wonder...

133
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:53,739
There.

134
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,339
Hey, hey, hey.

135
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,839
The giraffe's horn's been taken.

136
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,839
It can't be.

137
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,639
The four keys are still fixed to the wall.

138
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,439
How in the world...

139
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,239
I don't know how he did it yet but...

140
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:10,739
Either he or his accomplice ran around in the dark

141
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:14,339
during the one minute that the lights were out

142
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:17,539
and reached the four pedestals with the keyholes,

143
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,739
that's for sure.

144
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,839
This is...

145
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,339
Thief Kid's card!

146
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:26,539
Darn! Just when did he...

147
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,739
Inspector!

148
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:30,439
There's a card on the pedestal over here too.

149
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,939
Over here too.

150
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:33,039
This side too.

151
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:36,939
All four of them?

152
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:39,039
Inspector, the breaker of the main building

153
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,039
has been rigged in a strange way

154
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,139
and it's thought that the black-out was caused by it.

155
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,239
Inspector. Please come this way.

156
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:49,239
It seems that a tiny timer-type bomb

157
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:52,639
was set on to all the shutters of this building.

158
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,839
Darn, that Thief Kid.

159
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,539
He not only blacked the place out and threw us into the dark

160
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:58,839
but also blew away the windows,

161
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,739
let in the wind and rain in order to confuse us

162
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:04,939
and fled during all the chaos.

163
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:07,539
At any rate, I'm taking this brat

164
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:09,239
who was attacked by Thief Kid to the hospital.

165
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:11,239
Get me a car.

166
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:13,739
All the other remaining cars go after Thief Kid!

167
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:16,439
He couldn't possibly use his hand glider in this typhoon,

168
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:19,139
so shouldn't have gone too far yet.

169
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:20,939
But...

170
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:23,539
According to the information we received a while ago...

171
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:27,639
What? The road is blocked because of a landslide?

172
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:31,339
Hey, hey, if that brat was given poison or something...

173
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:34,639
It's not poison.

174
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,039
Look! It's a stun gun.

175
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,039
It seems he was knocked out by this.

176
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,739
I see.

177
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:44,639
That guy decided to put this little one,

178
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,239
who's most hard to beat to sleep first.

179
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:48,239
Sorry.

180
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,639
What do you mean, "I see".

181
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,239
I mean, it's all because you went and publicized

182
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:57,339
that jewelry that you just found last week to the media

183
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:59,339
even before we completed preparing or tight security.

184
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,039
That's why he walked off with the treasure.

185
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,239
It was a month ago.

186
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:05,939
I heard a month ago that the perfect amber,

187
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,839
the giraffe's horns

188
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,339
was laying asleep here at this temple.

189
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:12,339
I had them change the date of publicizing

190
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:15,439
because I was in the process of purchasing the treasure.

191
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:17,339
I wanted him to think that this old man

192
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,739
here got carried away at finding the perfect bait

193
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:22,839
to capture that thief...

194
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,039
Therefore, although security wasn't really prepared yet,

195
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,839
I lead him to think that I accepted his challenge.

196
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,539
Which means that the make-shift lighting...

197
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:35,939
Right, I knew he would be causing a black-out.

198
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:40,439
I also knew about that trick he used on the shutters.

199
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,539
The electric current I rigged on the pedestals

200
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:49,639
and calling the children were all strategies to lure him

201
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,239
to coming to this temple.

202
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:54,339
The lattice on the windows that with wood

203
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:56,139
that looks worn out and easy to break.

204
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:57,539
As well as the wall here that looks as if it would collapse

205
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:58,739
with the pound of a fist

206
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:00,439
are all made of steel on the inside.

207
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:03,639
Moreover, on one of the doors of the two at the entrance,

208
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:05,339
it is made so that it can be locked

209
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,839
and a sensor is built into it.

210
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,639
If the door is forced open,

211
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,239
a very noisy alarm is set to go off.

212
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,439
But since there were no such sound,

213
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:20,139
in other words, Thief Kid and his accomplices...

214
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:23,739
are still in here.

215
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:25,739
They are...

216
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:27,439
The Thief Kid is still in here?

217
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:28,539
Thief Kid?

218
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:35,024
So, Inspector Nakamori,

219
00:11:35,024 --> 00:11:36,624
it's show time!

220
00:11:36,624 --> 00:11:38,624
Check out all the faces of everyone here

221
00:11:38,624 --> 00:11:40,724
excluding the children and...

222
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:43,324
There's something I'd like to make clear before that.

223
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:47,134
Let me explain how Thief Kid took the amber horns

224
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:50,374
from the statue of the giraffe.

225
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:53,774
Just before the black-out, unless you insert

226
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:57,474
and turn the white, black, red and green keys

227
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:59,174
that you nailed onto the wall of this room of the pedestals

228
00:11:59,174 --> 00:12:04,174
that are in the four corners of the room

229
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:06,774
at the same time...

230
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:10,374
nobody could view the statue of the giraffe

231
00:12:10,374 --> 00:12:13,474
that is hidden in the pillar in the center.

232
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:17,874
If by chance, Thief Kid got himself a spare somehow...

233
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:19,174
How in the world did he, in the dark,

234
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:20,974
where the pedestals nor the keyholes

235
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,474
were in view do what he did?

236
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:27,274
As for light, the little ones had it on them, didn't they?

237
00:12:27,274 --> 00:12:29,874
The one on their watches!

238
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,974
Since they said they would be guarding pedestal,

239
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:34,774
Thief Kid probably used that light to do.

240
00:12:34,774 --> 00:12:37,074
We didn't turn on the light!

241
00:12:37,074 --> 00:12:39,174
It's true that we were covering the keyhole

242
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:41,274
like this though.

243
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:43,474
Because Ai told us not to turn on the light

244
00:12:43,474 --> 00:12:45,474
even if the lights went out.

245
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:48,174
And, while you were covering the keyhole,

246
00:12:48,174 --> 00:12:49,774
did anyone come?

247
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:52,074
-No! -What?

248
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:53,774
This keyhole...

249
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,074
Something's glowing.

250
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,074
What?

251
00:12:58,574 --> 00:13:01,174
This is florescent paint.

252
00:13:01,174 --> 00:13:05,074
Inspector, there's florescent on the keyhole on this side too.

253
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:06,174
Which means...

254
00:13:06,174 --> 00:13:08,074
No way!

255
00:13:08,074 --> 00:13:09,374
Just as I thought.

256
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:13,074
There's florescent paint on the tip of all four keys.

257
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:14,674
It probably got on there

258
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:17,274
when the key was stuck into the keyhole.

259
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:18,574
Which means, he was guided

260
00:13:18,574 --> 00:13:20,674
by the slightest light of the keyhole.

261
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:21,974
Yes.

262
00:13:21,974 --> 00:13:24,274
He gave all his accomplices the keys in the dark

263
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:26,174
and made them insert them into the glowing keyhole,

264
00:13:26,174 --> 00:13:27,474
then turn all the keys at the same time,

265
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:33,374
then stole the horns of the giraffe, right?

266
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:35,374
Mr. Thief Kid!

267
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:38,074
What me?

268
00:13:38,074 --> 00:13:40,274
Isn't it so?

269
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:42,874
It's an obvious fact that the keys

270
00:13:42,874 --> 00:13:46,474
that were used weren't spare keys but these keys.

271
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:47,474
In other words,

272
00:13:47,474 --> 00:13:53,274
you nailed the keys on very lightly

273
00:13:53,274 --> 00:13:58,274
so that after using them you could put them back really easily.

274
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:00,974
Then, try pulling that metal out.

275
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:04,074
It won't come off that easily.

276
00:14:04,074 --> 00:14:08,074
You probably nailed it back firmly when you returned the keys.

277
00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:09,374
If you're going as far as to say that,

278
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:11,774
why don't you check my body?

279
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:13,774
If I'm Thief Kid, I should still have

280
00:14:13,774 --> 00:14:15,274
the horns of the giraffe on me.

281
00:14:15,274 --> 00:14:17,574
Yes, even if you don't tell me,

282
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:18,674
that's exactly what I'm planning to do...

283
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:20,074
Wait.

284
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:23,374
Will you let us, the Youth Detective Squad

285
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:26,174
do the body check?

286
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:28,674
If you, Inspector or the advisor is Thief Kid

287
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:30,574
and his accomplices,

288
00:14:30,574 --> 00:14:33,474
you may fake checking and deceive us.

289
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:34,674
Exactly.

290
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,474
We can be trusted.

291
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:39,674
We're for sure not Thief Kid's accomplice.

292
00:14:39,674 --> 00:14:41,674
That's true.

293
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:44,274
We'll be checking all the others too,

294
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:45,874
but that's okay, right?

295
00:14:45,874 --> 00:14:46,874
Yes.

296
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:54,174
"We will be making some changes in the program.

297
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:56,874
Please wait a moment," it says.

298
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:59,874
This telop has been streaming from some time ago.

299
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:02,174
It's sure taking long for the program to restart.

300
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:05,274
I wonder what that strange sound was, though?

301
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:07,874
It was sure unpleasant to the ears.

302
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,674
What? Was there such a sound?

303
00:15:16,574 --> 00:15:18,174
What?

304
00:15:18,174 --> 00:15:21,574
You checked all the people in this temple building

305
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:24,574
but the giraffe's horn is nowhere in sight?

306
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:28,574
No. We thought that maybe it may secretly

307
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:30,074
have been put into our clothes and pockets too,

308
00:15:30,074 --> 00:15:31,474
so we checked our clothes

309
00:15:31,474 --> 00:15:34,074
as well as the pockets of Conan's clothes but couldn't find it.

310
00:15:34,074 --> 00:15:35,974
It's strange.

311
00:15:35,974 --> 00:15:37,674
The bars of the windows were made

312
00:15:37,674 --> 00:15:40,074
with a width that the giraffe's horn couldn't pass through,

313
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:41,574
so even if his accomplices were to be outside,

314
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,074
he couldn't have given it to them.

315
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:45,174
That's why...

316
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:47,674
Thief Kid's already fled.

317
00:15:47,674 --> 00:15:50,274
Open the door up right away so we can go after him.

318
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:52,174
No, but...

319
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:55,774
It's true. That since the treasure

320
00:15:55,774 --> 00:15:57,574
that he was after is no longer here,

321
00:15:57,574 --> 00:16:01,374
so it's most natural to think that he's gone,

322
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:03,474
but I just don't get it.

323
00:16:03,474 --> 00:16:06,574
I wonder why he knocked Conan out.

324
00:16:06,574 --> 00:16:08,574
Well, I guess getting rid of the one

325
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:09,674
who is thought to be most difficult to handle,

326
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:12,474
would make things way easier,

327
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:14,874
but doing so, would deprive Thief Kid of the pleasure

328
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,974
of feeling superior for carrying out what he'd done

329
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:18,974
right in front of Conan's eyes.

330
00:16:18,974 --> 00:16:22,674
I wonder if he had some other reason?

331
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:24,574
And another thing that bothers me

332
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:25,974
is this phrase written by Kichiemon Samizu

333
00:16:25,974 --> 00:16:28,374
that is carved on the pillar.

334
00:16:28,374 --> 00:16:30,374
"One who desires to acquire the giraffe

335
00:16:30,374 --> 00:16:32,474
without using the correct method,

336
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:35,074
must move with the flow."

337
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:38,374
In other words, it means,

338
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:40,574
anyone who tries to acquire the giraffe's horn,

339
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:43,074
not using the proper method, must go with the flow.

340
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:47,274
The proper method probably refers to the keys,

341
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:48,974
but what is the flow?

342
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:51,774
Wind?

343
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:53,774
The flow of the wind?

344
00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:56,474
No. The wind is blowing now

345
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,774
because Thief Kid broke the shutters.

346
00:16:58,774 --> 00:17:01,174
That's right, why did Thief Kid open the window

347
00:17:01,174 --> 00:17:02,974
in the first place?

348
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:04,474
He caused a black-out

349
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:06,874
so it would've been meaningless for him to confuse us

350
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:08,274
by bringing in the wind and rain.

351
00:17:09,274 --> 00:17:11,274
And, as Inspector Nakamori says,

352
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:14,574
if Advisor Suzuki were to be Thief Kid,

353
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:17,474
to take the keys that are fixed

354
00:17:17,474 --> 00:17:20,474
to the wall in less than a minute, moreover in the dark.

355
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:21,974
In addition to pass it around to his accomplices

356
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,174
without using any light at all.

357
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:24,274
Then, without even giving a signal,

358
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:26,174
have everyone insert and turn the key at the same time.

359
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:29,074
And finally make the treasure vanish as if by magic,

360
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:31,574
I wonder if doing something like that is possible.

361
00:17:31,574 --> 00:17:33,574
Besides, it's even dubious

362
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,974
that Thief Kid had any accomplices with him.

363
00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:39,274
If he brought that many accomplices to a closed up place like this,

364
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:42,974
it's very likely that at least one of them would be caught.

365
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:46,174
I would avoid any such risk at all cost.

366
00:17:46,174 --> 00:17:47,974
No good.

367
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:50,574
I'm not good at things like this after all.

368
00:17:50,574 --> 00:17:53,774
I'm sure that this is what you'd say.

369
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:55,874
"You can't even figure out something as simple as that?"

370
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,974
Or, something to that effect.

371
00:17:58,974 --> 00:17:59,974
You'd probably keep on going at it like a sparrow,

372
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:01,374
tweet-tweeting on forever,

373
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:03,774
lining all your know-it-all knowledge.

374
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:04,974
Sparrow...

375
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:12,174
Maybe the "sparrow" is some kind of hint to that phrase.

376
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,274
Why?

377
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:16,674
It's almost completely erased,

378
00:18:16,674 --> 00:18:18,174
but the word "sparrow"

379
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:20,674
was carved on that red pedestal.

380
00:18:20,674 --> 00:18:22,774
No joke.

381
00:18:22,774 --> 00:18:24,974
Red sparrow...

382
00:18:24,974 --> 00:18:26,074
"Vermilion Bird".

383
00:18:32,174 --> 00:18:36,174
It's true. The word "sparrow" can be seen.

384
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:40,374
Then, maybe there was a statue of a sparrow here.

385
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:42,574
It's not sparrow.

386
00:18:42,574 --> 00:18:44,674
Red is the vermilion color.

387
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:46,874
If the character written on top of the character sparrow

388
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:48,574
had been erase is the character "Zhu"

389
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:50,274
that symbolizes the vermilion color.

390
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:51,974
It is the legendary deity,

391
00:18:51,974 --> 00:18:54,174
one of the four gods is the Vermilion Bird.

392
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,374
"Vermilion Bird"

393
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:57,974
The vermilion bird is...

394
00:18:57,974 --> 00:19:00,174
The one that comes out a lot in games.

395
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:02,574
The red bird that looks like the Phoenix.

396
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:06,074
Yes. And the white pedestal

397
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:08,774
to the right of the red pedestal facing it,

398
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,074
is the White Tiger.

399
00:19:10,074 --> 00:19:13,274
"White Tiger"

400
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:16,374
The black pedestal to its right on the side is...

401
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:17,974
the Black Tortoise.

402
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:19,874
"Black Tortoise"

403
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:22,574
And the one to the right on the side,

404
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:24,174
that is to the left of the first red pedestal,

405
00:19:24,174 --> 00:19:27,674
on top of the green pedestal,

406
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:30,174
it may be safe and correct to say

407
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:31,874
that the statue of the Blue Dragon was there.

408
00:19:31,874 --> 00:19:33,474
Please wait.

409
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:36,574
It's called the Blue Dragon, isn't it?

410
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:39,274
But, the color of the pedestal is green.

411
00:19:39,274 --> 00:19:40,574
The word "green"

412
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:42,174
originally referred to the lush green

413
00:19:42,174 --> 00:19:45,174
tree-line mountains, green trees and plants.

414
00:19:45,174 --> 00:19:49,574
The true color of the dragon is said to be green.

415
00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:54,174
The four deities each protect a certain direction,

416
00:19:54,174 --> 00:19:55,674
The Vermilion Bird is the guardian of the South.

417
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:57,274
The White Tiger guards the West.

418
00:19:57,274 --> 00:19:58,874
The Black Tortoise guards the North.

419
00:19:58,874 --> 00:20:00,574
And, the Blue Dragon, the East.

420
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,874
And the one that is positioned in the middle is...

421
00:20:03,874 --> 00:20:05,474
this giraffe.

422
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:10,274
So, the sentence that was written by Kichiemon Samizu

423
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:12,774
at the foot of the pillar means...

424
00:20:12,774 --> 00:20:17,774
Well, it's a sort of after-care for in case

425
00:20:17,774 --> 00:20:20,574
at a later time, the keys are lost or stolen.

426
00:20:20,574 --> 00:20:23,574
The first part, "One who desires to acquire the giraffe

427
00:20:23,574 --> 00:20:25,174
without using the correct method" means...

428
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:26,874
Anyone who wants to get a hold of the giraffe's horn

429
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:28,474
without relying on the keys.

430
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:33,074
That follows behind means

431
00:20:33,074 --> 00:20:37,174
the flow of the moving of places and time.

432
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:39,474
In other words, it can also be interpreted

433
00:20:39,474 --> 00:20:43,774
as to let things just be, but...

434
00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:45,874
So, if we stay here and do nothing,

435
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:48,274
is the giraffe going to come out of the pillar?

436
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:49,474
No.

437
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:51,374
If the four pedestals that are placed in the four corners

438
00:20:51,374 --> 00:20:53,074
of this room each stand for the Vermilion Bird,

439
00:20:53,074 --> 00:20:55,874
White Tiger, Black Tortoise and Blue Dragon

440
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:57,274
it may have something to do

441
00:20:57,274 --> 00:20:58,774
with the color each deity symbolizes,

442
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:00,974
as well as the direction.

443
00:21:00,974 --> 00:21:03,374
Right. I think we're suppose to do something

444
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:04,774
to keep in the flow of the four pedestals

445
00:21:04,774 --> 00:21:06,574
by doing something in a given order.

446
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:08,874
There is no order to the color.

447
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:10,974
Maybe we're supposed to do something

448
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:13,574
in the order of east, west south and north?

449
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:16,974
But, they have the "east-north".

450
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:17,974
Northeast district too.

451
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:19,374
Isn't the direction next to east supposed to be north?

452
00:21:19,374 --> 00:21:21,674
I think north comes first.

453
00:21:21,674 --> 00:21:25,174
Because north is located at the very top on every map.

454
00:21:25,174 --> 00:21:27,274
I guess just the direction won't help us in figuring out

455
00:21:27,274 --> 00:21:28,974
what order something should be done.

456
00:21:28,974 --> 00:21:31,174
Be it clockwise or counter clockwise,

457
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:33,074
the flow is the flow.

458
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:35,574
True. I hope there is some kind of set order

459
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:37,374
to the Vermilion Bird, White Tiger,

460
00:21:37,374 --> 00:21:40,174
Black Tortoise and Blue Dragon.

461
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,974
If it were Conan, he may know something.

462
00:21:42,974 --> 00:21:45,974
He's been asleep for a while now.

463
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:46,974
At any rate,

464
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:50,074
in order to make the giraffe appear from out of this pillar,

465
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:51,874
we've got no choice but to insert keys into the keyholes

466
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:54,774
of the four pedestals and turn them at the same time

467
00:21:54,774 --> 00:21:55,974
or without using the keys,

468
00:21:55,974 --> 00:21:59,574
do something to the four pedestals in a certain order.

469
00:21:59,574 --> 00:22:01,574
There is no other possible way to do it.

470
00:22:01,574 --> 00:22:04,174
It would be impossible for Thief Kid alone to do something like that

471
00:22:04,174 --> 00:22:07,374
within the one minute of the time the place blacked out.

472
00:22:07,374 --> 00:22:08,774
If he had any accomplices,

473
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:11,674
he would've had to give out some kind of signal.

474
00:22:11,674 --> 00:22:13,874
Let's check on that, first of all.

475
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,474
Check on it, how?

476
00:22:16,474 --> 00:22:17,874
They're here, aren't they?

477
00:22:17,874 --> 00:22:22,074
The TV crew that is taking evidence

478
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:25,274
filled VTR shots.

479
00:22:25,274 --> 00:22:29,074
Conan, I guess we have no choice

480
00:22:29,074 --> 00:22:30,474
but to do what we can

481
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,074
on our own until you wake up.

482
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,874
Young staff were supposed to come today.

483
00:23:57,874 --> 00:23:59,374
If you put it that way,

484
00:23:59,374 --> 00:24:02,274
you, the cameraman is also suspicious!

485
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,174
Don't just sleep there forever,

486
00:24:05,174 --> 00:24:06,474
and help us figure this out, will you?

487
00:24:06,474 --> 00:24:07,474
White.

488
00:24:07,474 --> 00:24:09,074
What?

489
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:14,474
Hurry up and unlock that door.

490
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:16,374
You're the one, aren't you?

491
00:24:16,374 --> 00:24:18,774
The magician under the moon.

492
00:24:18,774 --> 00:24:20,274
Next Conan,

493
00:24:20,274 --> 00:24:26,874
"Thief Kid vs. the Detective Squad"
