1
00:00:00,977 --> 00:00:04,070
Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest?

2
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:08,203
Is your father going to enter that contest?

3
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:13,303
Yeah, it seems he made it through the "pry Mary entree"!

4
00:00:13,303 --> 00:00:15,003
Pry Mary entree?

5
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:16,403
What's that?

6
00:00:16,403 --> 00:00:19,303
He passed the primary entry.

7
00:00:19,698 --> 00:00:21,098
The judges look through the pictures

8
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:23,498
and profile that the candidates send in

9
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:25,498
and narrow down the contestants.

10
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:27,698
My Dad is a real man

11
00:00:27,698 --> 00:00:30,198
so it was already certain that he would be chosen.

12
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,798
I've never met him,

13
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:35,198
but I'll bet he's the typical "you know" type.

14
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:37,498
And? If he wins the contest,

15
00:00:37,498 --> 00:00:38,998
does he get anything?

16
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:40,698
In the letter that he got from them,

17
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:43,098
it said that he would get money.

18
00:00:43,098 --> 00:00:44,098
If I remember correctly,

19
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:48,098
there were 7 zeros after the number 1.

20
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:50,798
7 zeros.

21
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:52,798
That's 10,000,000 yen!

22
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:54,398
Wow!

23
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:56,798
Who planned it?

24
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:58,798
Whose plan?

25
00:00:58,798 --> 00:01:02,698
Who sent him the letter? Who is it?

26
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:05,398
Nichiuri TV was written on it.

27
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,598
But it seems that Dad's more interested

28
00:01:07,598 --> 00:01:09,398
in the wild boar hanging scroll

29
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:12,798
that comes with the money more than the money.

30
00:01:12,798 --> 00:01:15,298
If it's really from Nichiuri TV,

31
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:17,298
I guess it's not a fraud or anything.

32
00:01:17,298 --> 00:01:19,098
It's quite a large sum of money.

33
00:01:19,098 --> 00:01:21,998
You mean it's a drawing of a wild boar?

34
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,998
Yeah. I saw the picture in the letter

35
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:27,098
and it was a black and white drawing.

36
00:01:27,098 --> 00:01:29,798
I didn't think that it was all that great,

37
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,898
but Dad liked wild boars from before

38
00:01:32,898 --> 00:01:35,598
and said that he wanted to decorate it in the alcove.

39
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:37,698
He said that he liked it

40
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,198
also because the artist's name read "thank you"!

41
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:41,798
"Thank you"?

42
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:46,098
Genta, it could be that the money

43
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:47,998
is what comes along with the picture.

44
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:49,198
What?

45
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:52,398
You mean the 10,000,000 is what comes along with the drawing?

46
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:55,598
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

47
00:01:55,598 --> 00:01:58,098
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

48
00:01:58,098 --> 00:01:59,098
An unexpected turn of events.

49
00:01:59,098 --> 00:02:02,298
Genta's father is thought to be the culprit and is in a fix.

50
00:02:02,298 --> 00:02:03,898
He sees through the one and only truth.

51
00:02:03,898 --> 00:02:05,798
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

52
00:02:05,798 --> 00:02:07,898
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

53
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,019
"The Culprit is Genta's Father (Part 1)"

54
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,170
What? It's worth 50,000,000 yen?

55
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:00,588
You mean this hanging scroll?

56
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:04,588
Yeah. If it's really a black and white hanging scroll

57
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:07,588
drawn by the renown Sankyu Shonin.

58
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:10,988
I have a feeling I've seen this picture somewhere before.

59
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:12,088
Me too.

60
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:14,688
Dad said the same thing too.

61
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,888
This is the wild boar of Hagi.

62
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:19,688
It's one of the pictures seen in the card game called Hana Fuda.

63
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:25,288
And why is this picture of Hana Fuda so valuable?

64
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:29,488
Yeah. When that hanging scroll was first discovered,

65
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:30,888
it was said that the drawing

66
00:04:30,888 --> 00:04:33,188
was a no-good piece that Sankyu drew as a joke.

67
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:35,988
But, later, the hanging scroll of a deer

68
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:38,488
and butterfly were also found,

69
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:40,688
and the value of the drawing soar up.

70
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:42,188
Because with the three together

71
00:04:42,188 --> 00:04:43,488
"wild boar, deer, and butterfly",

72
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:45,788
it was said to bring good luck.

73
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,688
In fact, it's said that a businessman of Iwate

74
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:51,588
who purchased the three scrolls

75
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,088
investing all the money that he had,

76
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:56,988
succeeded and built financial status for himself.

77
00:04:56,988 --> 00:04:59,088
And since then, that's how much the scrolls are worth.

78
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:02,488
So, it's indeed a hanging scroll that brings happiness.

79
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:06,388
But, since one of them is the award,

80
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:08,888
that businessman must've let go of the drawings.

81
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:10,388
No, if he let them go,

82
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:12,488
I'm sure it would've made the news,

83
00:05:12,488 --> 00:05:14,388
so I'm sure he still has them.

84
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:17,788
I wonder what the name of that businessman was?

85
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:20,188
Gonsaku Kojima.

86
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:22,288
He's the chairman of the Kojima group

87
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,688
as well as the sponsor of this Mr. Kojima Contest.

88
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:28,588
You mean the super rich Kojima group

89
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:29,888
that owns a lot of things

90
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:31,588
like railroads and department stores?

91
00:05:31,588 --> 00:05:36,588
Right. After losing two out of the three hanging scrolls,

92
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:39,288
it was no use holding on to just one,

93
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:40,888
so it was written in the chairman's blog

94
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:42,788
that he decided to set up this plan

95
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:45,788
to give it to someone.

96
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:46,788
And if so, he wanted to give it to someone

97
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:49,688
who had the same name as he, Kojima.

98
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:51,388
You're lucky you're a Kojima!

99
00:05:52,388 --> 00:05:55,388
Then, the letter asking you to make entry

100
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,788
came directly to your house, Genta?

101
00:05:56,788 --> 00:05:59,688
No. We were invited to come by another Kojima

102
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:01,088
who lives in the neighborhood.

103
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:02,588
He told us that he saw Kojimas

104
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:04,288
being asked to come together on the internet,

105
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:07,188
so he asked my Dad to enter too.

106
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:10,888
Then, what do you have to do to win?

107
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:13,188
A lot of stuff was written.

108
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:17,288
Physical endurance contest, singing contest

109
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:20,388
and even a Kanji character dictation test.

110
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:21,588
I see.

111
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:25,288
He wants to choose a well-rounded almighty Mr. Kojima.

112
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:27,188
Looks like it's going to be tough.

113
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:30,988
But, he can sing.

114
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:33,788
He's far better than Conan.

115
00:06:34,888 --> 00:06:37,188
Hey, isn't that hurdle a bit too low?

116
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,788
Is your father going to be okay, Genta?

117
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:41,788
Nothing's for sure.

118
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:46,088
Then, I guess the one who scores the highest

119
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:49,088
in all three of those matches will be the winner.

120
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:51,788
No, there's more to it.

121
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:54,088
The ones who make it through

122
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:56,988
will all gather in Studio 5

123
00:06:56,988 --> 00:06:59,188
and the winner will be determined

124
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:03,088
after answering a quiz in front of the audience.

125
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:07,888
OK. All 5 will move.

126
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:09,988
I see, the final contest is going to be who answers

127
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:11,688
the fastest quiz contest.

128
00:07:15,388 --> 00:07:18,788
They're the Mr. Kojimas who are competing in the contest.

129
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:20,888
How's the contest coming along?

130
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:22,888
How's it going, oh bummers!

131
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:23,988
The match is only about

132
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:27,388
how many push-ups you can do in three minutes.

133
00:07:27,388 --> 00:07:29,888
I really tried hard

134
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:33,488
and did 180 sit up but didn't make it.

135
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:36,188
Well, anybody who makes it through

136
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:37,888
is a monster.

137
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:44,288
I'm sure your father'll do okay, though, Genta.

138
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:47,988
Yeah. He can do it hands down.

139
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:53,288
There's a different group of Kojimas coming this way.

140
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:56,988
I didn't think that I'd be disqualified singing.

141
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:59,288
Well, it can't be helped

142
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:01,888
because even he who won successive awards

143
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:04,088
in singing contests didn't make it.

144
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:06,088
Don't get so depressed.

145
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:08,488
In order to make it through this contest,

146
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,288
you've got to have the singing ability of Elvis Presley.

147
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:13,888
Pruse Lee? Did he means the one that comes out in Kung-Fu movies.

148
00:08:13,888 --> 00:08:15,988
That's Bruce Lee you're talking about.

149
00:08:15,988 --> 00:08:19,388
They're talking about Elvis Presley,

150
00:08:19,388 --> 00:08:21,888
the King of Rock and Roll.

151
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:25,588
Is your father really going to be all right, Genta?

152
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:29,488
Yeah. I think so.

153
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:31,888
Darn! Why? How come?

154
00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:33,888
Hey, cool it!

155
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,788
Yet another group.

156
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:37,488
Because don't you think it's funny?

157
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:39,188
I've reached Level 1 in the kanji writing test, you know,

158
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:42,488
so how could I flunk the kanji dictation test?

159
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,988
I answered the test perfectly and yet.

160
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:47,688
It's just that you didn't answer it perfectly.

161
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:49,388
Then, can you write?

162
00:08:49,388 --> 00:08:52,088
The kanji character for "rose" or "melancholy"?

163
00:08:52,088 --> 00:08:54,188
Well, no.

164
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:57,588
Hey, Genta, your father...

165
00:08:57,588 --> 00:08:59,888
He probably...

166
00:08:59,888 --> 00:09:02,288
won't make it.

167
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:04,088
The phone.

168
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:07,888
It's from my Dad.

169
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:09,888
What?

170
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:12,988
Hello. This is Genta.

171
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,488
What? No joke?

172
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:19,988
You made it to the three finalists?

173
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:21,388
Really?

174
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:23,488
That's amazing.

175
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:25,188
Everybody's here rooting for you,

176
00:09:25,188 --> 00:09:27,488
so give it your best shot!

177
00:09:27,488 --> 00:09:30,088
But, it's strange.

178
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:33,688
There are 5 seats for the quick pushing quiz

179
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:37,188
and yet I wonder why only 3 people made it?

180
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:41,488
"Evaluation Room" -Chairman Kojima.

181
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:44,988
We got a complaint from the producer of the TV station,

182
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:46,188
saying that the program is meaningless

183
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:47,288
the way things are going.

184
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:49,788
"Gonsaku Kojima (71)" -Never mind.

185
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:51,588
"Chairman of the Kojima Group" -By the way,

186
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:54,588
did you show it to the three finalists?

187
00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:58,688
I'm asking you if you showed them the paper

188
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:00,888
that we secretly prepared?

189
00:10:00,888 --> 00:10:02,288
Oh, yes.

190
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:06,588
But, all three of them answered differently.

191
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:08,388
Who cares.

192
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:11,188
Tell me how they read it.

193
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:16,988
"Bunta Kojima (33)" -Contestant number 35, Mr. Bunta Kojima's answer

194
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:19,088
was "Hapyakuichi" (801).

195
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:22,488
"Genji Kojima (32)" -Contestant number 84, Mr. Genji Kojima

196
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,188
answered "Shakuhachi" (Bamboo flute).

197
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:27,788
"Gankichi Kojima (34)" -Contestant number 147, Mr. Gankichi Kojima

198
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:29,588
answered "Ippin" (First class).

199
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:35,188
Chairman?

200
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:38,788
He's finally disclosed himself.

201
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:40,288
Disclosed himself?

202
00:10:40,288 --> 00:10:43,388
Using all that money was all worthwhile.

203
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:44,588
What?

204
00:10:44,588 --> 00:10:46,388
Where's that paper now?

205
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:48,988
Oh, yes.

206
00:10:48,988 --> 00:10:50,788
Here in this envelope.

207
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:52,088
Good.

208
00:10:52,088 --> 00:10:53,988
I'll take care of everything from here.

209
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,688
You may go now.

210
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,988
But, chairman...

211
00:10:58,988 --> 00:11:02,088
I'm going in person

212
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:05,288
to the waiting room to welcome

213
00:11:05,288 --> 00:11:08,888
the honourable winner of the Mr. Kojima contest.

214
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:10,588
"Nationwide Mr.Kojima Contest."

215
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:14,488
It's almost time.

216
00:11:14,488 --> 00:11:17,888
I wish my Dad'll come out quickly.

217
00:11:17,888 --> 00:11:20,488
There he is.

218
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:23,088
Isn't that the staff of Nichiuri TV?

219
00:11:23,088 --> 00:11:24,988
I guess so.

220
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:29,188
We are very sorry to announce

221
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:33,988
that this Mr. Kojima contest has been cancelled

222
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:35,688
due to reasons on our side.

223
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:36,888
What?

224
00:11:36,888 --> 00:11:40,388
-Hey! You've gotta be kidding! -What do you mean?

225
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:43,088
The stain on his sleeve...

226
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:45,088
Isn't that a blood stain?

227
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:47,688
I'll go check.

228
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:48,688
Conan?

229
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:50,688
You guys stay where you are and don't move!

230
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:58,188
Chairman!

231
00:11:58,188 --> 00:12:00,288
Chairman? Chairman Kojima?

232
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:02,788
Hey, did you call the ambulance?

233
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:05,388
Yes. They should be here in 10 minutes.

234
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:06,588
What happened?

235
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:10,188
It seems he tripped and fell down the stairs.

236
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:14,088
Did you see him fall?

237
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:17,188
No, I heard a loud sound together with his scream,

238
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:18,588
so I rushed over

239
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:20,688
and found the chairman lying on the floor alone.

240
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:23,688
Then, you'd better call the police too.

241
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:27,488
-The police? -See, look at the chairman's right hand.

242
00:12:27,488 --> 00:12:30,088
He's holding a piece of paper.

243
00:12:30,088 --> 00:12:33,888
If a person is about to trip and fall from the stairs,

244
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:36,188
it's unnatural for the person to be holding the paper, wouldn't it?

245
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,788
When he was about to fall,

246
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:39,888
the chairman grabbed the piece of paper

247
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:42,288
that the person who was next to him was holding.

248
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:45,488
Or he fought for the piece of paper with someone

249
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,388
and mistakenly fell.

250
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:48,688
I see.

251
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:50,088
Where's the staff member that announced

252
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:51,688
the contest would be cancelled a while ago?

253
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,788
He seemed to have a blood stain on his sleeve.

254
00:12:53,788 --> 00:12:57,788
He rushed over to the chairman with us and tried to carry him up,

255
00:12:57,788 --> 00:13:00,088
so maybe that's when the blood stained his sleeve.

256
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:02,788
At any rate, when the chairman fell from the stairs,

257
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:05,388
someone should've been with him.

258
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:07,388
And yet when you all rushed over to him,

259
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:10,488
that person was gone together with the piece of paper,

260
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:12,588
means that it's almost unmistakable

261
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:14,888
that the person was the cause of the fall and fled.

262
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:15,888
But...

263
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:18,288
Who are you?

264
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:19,688
Oh, well...

265
00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:22,588
Maybe that someone could be

266
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:25,788
one of the three finalists.

267
00:13:26,788 --> 00:13:29,188
The chairman said,

268
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:31,388
"I'm going in person to the waiting room

269
00:13:31,388 --> 00:13:33,688
to welcome the honorable winner."

270
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,788
That's why I was waiting in another room together with the staff.

271
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:41,888
Hey... Don't tell me that the three finalists include...

272
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:45,788
What's the entire racket here about?

273
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:52,188
Is anything the matter?

274
00:13:52,188 --> 00:13:53,888
I don't know what's going on,

275
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:56,588
but I wish they'd hurry and let us do the last quiz?

276
00:13:56,588 --> 00:13:59,388
I'm tired of waiting already.

277
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:02,088
Don't tell me that Genta's father

278
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:04,188
is also considered one of the suspects too?

279
00:14:04,188 --> 00:14:08,788
Who among these three

280
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:11,488
is Genta's father?

281
00:14:18,672 --> 00:14:22,372
The victim is Mr. Gonsaku Kojima, age 71.

282
00:14:22,372 --> 00:14:23,972
He's the chairman of the Kojima Group,

283
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:26,072
and he seems to have come here today

284
00:14:26,072 --> 00:14:29,972
to serve as the head judge for this special TV program.

285
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:31,472
Head judge?

286
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:32,472
Yes.

287
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,672
It's a program called "Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest"

288
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:39,872
that Chairman Kojima himself planned and sponsored.

289
00:14:39,872 --> 00:14:44,272
The winner was scheduled to receive a gorgeous award.

290
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:47,872
But from the looks of it, it looks like an accident

291
00:14:47,872 --> 00:14:51,272
in which he tripped and fell off the stairs.

292
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:56,572
It seems that this is not something for us,

293
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:58,772
the 1st division to cover.

294
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,472
I guess not.

295
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:02,372
Why'd you call us?

296
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:04,272
You're the one who called

297
00:15:04,272 --> 00:15:07,572
asking to talk to me directly, aren't you?

298
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:09,272
-The paper. -Paper?

299
00:15:09,272 --> 00:15:11,672
When we the staff rushed over,

300
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:14,072
the Chairman was bleeding from his head,

301
00:15:14,072 --> 00:15:16,372
holding a piece of torn paper

302
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:17,972
and lying on the floor.

303
00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:20,472
When a person is about to fall off the stairs,

304
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:22,472
do you think he'd hold a paper in his hand?

305
00:15:22,472 --> 00:15:24,072
No.

306
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:26,372
So, when the chairman fell,

307
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:27,872
there must've been someone near him,

308
00:15:27,872 --> 00:15:31,072
and he at the spur of the moment grabbed that piece of paper.

309
00:15:31,072 --> 00:15:34,272
Or he fought for the paper with someone

310
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:37,272
and accidentally fell off the stairs, right?

311
00:15:37,272 --> 00:15:40,172
But, when the Chairman was found lying on the floor

312
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,672
there was no one near him,

313
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:44,672
so we thought that maybe there was a person

314
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:47,172
who left the chairman who fell off the way he is

315
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:50,272
and ran off with the torn piece of paper.

316
00:15:50,272 --> 00:15:53,472
If so, we could have a case.

317
00:15:53,472 --> 00:15:55,072
But, how amazing.

318
00:15:55,072 --> 00:15:56,072
To deduce things that far

319
00:15:56,072 --> 00:15:58,172
and call an officer of the 1st division.

320
00:15:58,172 --> 00:16:02,672
Oh, it wasn't us,

321
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:05,172
but rather that little boy who told us

322
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,272
to call Officer Takagi of the Metropolitan Police.

323
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:08,972
Are you sure you really don't know?

324
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:11,172
You're the Chairman's secretary, aren't you?

325
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:14,772
But I was told by the Chairman not to look at it, so...

326
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:17,272
Conan?

327
00:16:17,272 --> 00:16:19,772
So, it's this pattern again.

328
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:24,272
I really don't know what was written on that paper.

329
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:27,272
Besides, I kept it for him in this envelope all the while.

330
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:31,272
Are you referring to the paper

331
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:34,372
that the Chairman was holding in his hand?

332
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:36,372
Yes, Sir. Most probably...

333
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:38,772
That paper is a Japanese paper

334
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:41,372
that the Chairman uses on special occasions.

335
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:43,772
I got a glimpse of the paper

336
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:46,972
when the chairman was putting it in the envelope.

337
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:50,772
But, I only had that paper on me temporarily,

338
00:16:50,772 --> 00:16:54,272
and I gave it back to the chairman just before we parted,

339
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:56,472
with the paper still in the envelope.

340
00:16:56,472 --> 00:16:59,472
An empty envelope was found on the corpse,

341
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:01,172
so I believe he's telling the truth.

342
00:17:01,172 --> 00:17:03,872
But, why were holding it for him?

343
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:06,072
So that I could show it to the three.

344
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:07,172
The three?

345
00:17:07,172 --> 00:17:10,472
The three finalists of the Mr. Kojima contest.

346
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:13,372
There they are.

347
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:15,572
Mr. Kojima contest?

348
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:18,172
By the way, how were they chosen?

349
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:21,272
Mr. Kojima's nationwide were called upon on the net,

350
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:22,472
and of all the people who entered,

351
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:23,872
the candidates were narrowed down to 200,

352
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:26,872
who qualified to enter the contest.

353
00:17:26,872 --> 00:17:29,672
They had to compete doing exercise, such as the number of push ups

354
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:31,372
they could finish in three minutes.

355
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:32,772
Sing songs in a singing contest

356
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:34,372
to test their singing ability,

357
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:36,572
and compete in a kanji dictation test

358
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:38,872
to test their intelligence.

359
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:40,272
I see.

360
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:44,072
So, those three men have intelligence

361
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:46,672
are physically fit and sing well.

362
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:48,572
Yes, in a way...

363
00:17:48,572 --> 00:17:50,272
In a way?

364
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:52,772
And, what did he want you to do

365
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,772
after showing the three

366
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:56,372
the paper with the question on it?

367
00:17:56,372 --> 00:17:58,472
Well...

368
00:17:58,472 --> 00:18:00,472
He just simply wanted me

369
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:03,472
to ask them how they read the kanji.

370
00:18:03,472 --> 00:18:04,772
Oh, I see.

371
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:07,872
But, all three answered differently.

372
00:18:07,872 --> 00:18:09,172
Differently?

373
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,372
Was some kind of code written on it?

374
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:15,972
No. All three answered almost immediately,

375
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:18,672
so I don't think the words were all that difficult.

376
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:21,972
Contestant number 35, Mr. Bunta Kojima answered.

377
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:24,272
"Hapyakuichi" (801).

378
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:27,472
Number 84, Mr. Genji Kojima answered.

379
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:29,772
"Shakuhachi" (Bamboo fluter).

380
00:18:29,772 --> 00:18:33,972
And number 147, Mr. Gankichi Kojima

381
00:18:33,972 --> 00:18:37,272
answered "Ippin" (First class).

382
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:40,172
The three truly did answer differently.

383
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:42,972
Did you really show them all the same piece of paper?

384
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:45,372
Yes, I did.

385
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:48,572
When I told the chairman what the answers of the three were,

386
00:18:48,572 --> 00:18:51,472
this is what he mumbled...

387
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:55,072
He's finally disclosed his true self.

388
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:58,072
Disclosed his true self?

389
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:02,472
Then he took the envelope with the paper inside it from me

390
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:06,572
and said that he was going to the waiting room in person

391
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:09,072
to welcome the winner of the Mr. Kojima contest.

392
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:10,772
I see. In other words,

393
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:14,572
he chose the winner after hearing the answers of the finalists?

394
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:16,472
Yes.

395
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:17,572
But, it seems strange for him to say,

396
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:21,472
"He's finally disclosed himself."

397
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:25,272
And he went to the winner's waiting room?

398
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:28,672
Yes, he told me to leave,

399
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:31,072
so I was in another room where the staff were

400
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:33,772
when I heard the chairman scream and a loud sound.

401
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,572
Inspector Megure!

402
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:37,172
Oh, Chiba!

403
00:19:37,172 --> 00:19:38,772
I got this story

404
00:19:38,772 --> 00:19:41,472
from the others who entered this contest.

405
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,972
The floor above these stairs

406
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:46,572
is where the waiting room for the finalists of this contest is.

407
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:48,572
It seems that the only ones who were on that floor

408
00:19:48,572 --> 00:19:52,272
when the chairman fell were the three finalists.

409
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:55,072
Were all three in the same room?

410
00:19:55,072 --> 00:19:58,772
No, they were all in separate rooms of their own.

411
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:02,072
Moreover, the elevator to that floor was being checked at that time,

412
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:05,972
so anyone who went outside used the stairs to go downstairs.

413
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:09,472
In other words, if when the staff rushed over,

414
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:13,072
there was no one near the chairman who was lying on the floor,

415
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:14,872
it's highly likely that one of the finalists

416
00:20:14,872 --> 00:20:17,572
after pushing the chairman off the stairs,

417
00:20:17,572 --> 00:20:23,072
went back to his room again.

418
00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:25,672
I guess we'll listen to what they have to say individually.

419
00:20:25,672 --> 00:20:28,472
-Yes, sir! -Oh, Officer Takagi.

420
00:20:29,472 --> 00:20:30,972
When you listen to what they have to say,

421
00:20:30,972 --> 00:20:34,072
I'd like you to ask them several other things too.

422
00:20:34,072 --> 00:20:35,772
How unusual.

423
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:37,272
You usually come along secretly

424
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:38,972
and ask them without asking for permission.

425
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:41,172
Well, you see...

426
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:42,672
What is it?

427
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:49,272
What? Genta's father is among the three?

428
00:20:49,272 --> 00:20:51,072
Which... which one is he?

429
00:20:51,072 --> 00:20:53,772
I don't know because I've never met him.

430
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:58,772
Maybe he knows me by photos or something, though.

431
00:20:58,772 --> 00:21:01,372
Then, I can find out right away if I ask.

432
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:02,772
I'll talk to Inspector Megure

433
00:21:02,772 --> 00:21:04,572
and have him taken off the list of suspects.

434
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:07,172
No! Holmes also said,

435
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:08,972
"Emotional qualities at times

436
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:13,172
can interfere deduction carrying you away from the truth".

437
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,772
We can't be 100% sure that he's not a suspect

438
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:18,372
just because he's Genta's father, can we?

439
00:21:18,372 --> 00:21:20,172
If you want to make a composed deduction,

440
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:22,572
I don't think you should ask.

441
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:26,472
So, could you ask them what I ask you to ask them, in my place?

442
00:21:26,472 --> 00:21:28,372
Okay.

443
00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:32,772
Maybe those three

444
00:21:32,772 --> 00:21:35,572
didn't really win their way through the contest.

445
00:21:35,572 --> 00:21:36,972
What?

446
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:41,572
"Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest."

447
00:21:41,572 --> 00:21:45,072
Conan sure is late, isn't he?

448
00:21:45,072 --> 00:21:48,272
-Yeah. -Maybe something happened after all.

449
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:51,072
I can hear the sound of the ambulance and police cars.

450
00:21:51,072 --> 00:21:55,172
Then, shall we go to check out how things are?

451
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:56,972
-Right! -Yes.

452
00:21:56,972 --> 00:21:59,972
-Let's go... -Don't!

453
00:21:59,972 --> 00:22:03,872
Conan told you all to stay put right here, didn't he?

454
00:22:03,872 --> 00:22:06,872
That's true, but...

455
00:22:06,872 --> 00:22:09,872
But if this is a homicide,

456
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:13,472
Genta's father may be involved too.

457
00:22:13,472 --> 00:22:14,872
That's why, the more so.

458
00:22:14,872 --> 00:22:17,172
If he just got mixed up in this,

459
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:20,372
Conan would probably contact us saying not to worry,

460
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,372
but if not...

461
00:22:22,372 --> 00:22:27,672
It's highly likely that he's also a suspect for something.

462
00:22:27,672 --> 00:22:30,172
Genta's father.

463
00:22:30,172 --> 00:22:32,272
What?

464
00:22:34,872 --> 00:22:36,672
Dad.

465
00:23:57,672 --> 00:23:59,472
"Next Episode" -From the chairman's bag

466
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:01,272
that was found in the judge's room

467
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:02,872
a gun was found!

468
00:24:02,872 --> 00:24:04,372
What?

469
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:06,572
Hyakkiyako?

470
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:09,272
Is it mean the group of killer robbers?

471
00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:10,972
That's right.

472
00:24:10,972 --> 00:24:13,972
He was planning on avenging

473
00:24:13,972 --> 00:24:16,072
the death of his pet dog.

474
00:24:16,072 --> 00:24:19,672
I'll go check after all!

475
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:21,672
Genta!

476
00:24:21,672 --> 00:24:27,972
Next Conan, "The Culprit is Genta's Father (Part 2)"

477
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:44,828
Next Conan's Hint:

478
00:24:44,828 --> 00:24:46,828
"Edoite."

479
00:24:46,828 --> 00:24:49,128
My Dad is handsome, so he's not the culprit.

480
00:24:49,128 --> 00:24:50,528
What kind of logic is that?

481
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:51,728
Really.
