1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,220
All here.

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,620
I'll be looking forward to it next month too.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,520
Give me a break already.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,620
I can't take it anymore.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,920
God knows what I went through to get that cash.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,420
"Katsutoshi Kue" -You're in charge of accounting

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,820
at your company, aren't you?

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,520
You've got loads of ways to get cash, don't you?

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,120
Don't be ridiculous!

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,120
You know I can't do something like that.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,120
It doesn't really matter.

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,620
But, I wonder what'll happen if that thing about you was revealed?

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,620
Your daughter's wedding...

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,620
Wait. Please not that.

15
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,420
If it's for the happiness of your daughter,

16
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,920
you'll do anything, wouldn't you?

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,720
Please forgive me already.

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,520
I can't keep paying that amount with my salary.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,620
I beg you.

20
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,220
If your salary's not enough,

21
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,720
why don't you part-time at night?

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,220
I already am.

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,520
But I can't go on any further.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,120
You can flee if you want.

25
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,420
But if you do, this will go on the internet.

26
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,420
If you don't want that to happen you know what to do, don't you?

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,820
If all cases were men,

28
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,620
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

29
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,520
The initial "K" that strangely stands out.

30
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,320
A suspicious dying message.

31
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,120
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,430
"Suspicious Initial K"

35
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:30,629
That restaurant was pretty delicious, wasn't it?

36
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:34,529
Yes, the spring rolls were exquisite.

37
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:39,529
Isn't that Officer Tateno?

38
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:42,429
Yes, I wonder if something happened?

39
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:45,629
Officer Sumio Tateno,

40
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:48,329
of Beikacho 5-chome police box.

41
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,929
He's serious, honest, and a good fellow.

42
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:54,029
He is also greatly trusted by the people of the community.

43
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:55,629
His dream has come true, and he will soon be transferred

44
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:58,529
to the Beika Police Department detective section.

45
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,629
Like I'm always saying.

46
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:02,229
Officer Tateno.

47
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:04,129
Is anything wrong?

48
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:06,529
Mr. Mouri, it's no big deal.

49
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:08,329
It is a big deal.

50
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:11,829
There's an audacious one who always messes up the trash dump,

51
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:16,029
I'm asking him to stake out all night and nab the one.

52
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,229
Like I said,

53
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:20,529
I'm concentrating on patroling this area, aren't I?

54
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,129
Are you all right?

55
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:33,229
Please get a hold of yourself.

56
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:39,129
Isn't that blood?

57
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:42,129
Somebody's dead inside.

58
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:43,229
What?

59
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,629
Please get a hold of yourself.

60
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:58,629
Are you all right?

61
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:05,429
So, this is the murder weapon.

62
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:09,229
There are marks of resistance on the corpse's hand.

63
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:10,529
That cushion...

64
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:13,129
Did the culprit stab the victim

65
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:16,329
after pushing the cushion against him to avoid splattering blood?

66
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:18,329
Mr. Mouri, please take care of this.

67
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:20,329
I will go and check to see if there is anyone suspicious

68
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:21,629
in the house.

69
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,529
Headquarters, Tateno of the police box in Beikacho 5-chome here.

70
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,729
Sir, over there.

71
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:33,129
"K".

72
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:35,029
Could this be a dying message?

73
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:37,929
Did a post crown come off?

74
00:05:40,429 --> 00:05:43,429
Did the culprit break it?

75
00:05:43,429 --> 00:05:45,729
There's no one in the house.

76
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,229
The door of the kitchen

77
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:50,729
as well as all of the windows are locked from the inside.

78
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:52,529
I see.

79
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:57,329
The victim is Mr. Zenkichi Ooka, age 64.

80
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,029
He lives alone in this house

81
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,229
and seems to be working as a security guard

82
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,029
at a supermarket in Haidocho.

83
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,929
Are you the one who discovered the corpse?

84
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:08,729
First of all, may I have your name?

85
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:11,929
"Kiwako Kaitani (25)" -I am Kiwako Kaitani.

86
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:15,929
Her initial is "K".

87
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:18,829
And you?

88
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,129
I'm Hanazawa.

89
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,229
I was watching all the while.

90
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:23,329
All the while?

91
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:26,829
Yes. I was talking at the front door with my friend

92
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:28,929
Ms. Nakajima who lives in 4-chome.

93
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:31,129
Then, I think it was a little after 6:00 pm,

94
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:33,329
Mr. Ooka came home.

95
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:34,629
Soon after,

96
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:37,329
a man came over to Mr. Ooka's house.

97
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:38,729
A man?

98
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:43,129
Yes. He looked to be a business man of about 50 years old.

99
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:47,029
But he rushed off home in about 10 minutes.

100
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:49,629
And?

101
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:51,229
About 20 minutes later,

102
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:55,729
she came and went into Mr. Ooka's house.

103
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:58,729
Soon, after Ms. Nakajima went home,

104
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:01,329
Mr. Tateno came along,

105
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:02,929
and talked about 5 minutes,

106
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:07,129
then these people came and she came out again.

107
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:12,729
I'm sure that the man who came before me I'm sure.

108
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:15,629
We've got to find that man right away.

109
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:16,829
Yes, sir.

110
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:18,129
What seems to be the matter?

111
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:22,029
It's that man who came to Mr. Ooka's house a while ago.

112
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:25,029
See, he's among the spectators.

113
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,729
The man wearing that cap?

114
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:27,729
Yes.

115
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:30,729
Hold it!

116
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:38,329
-Why you... -Don't move!

117
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:39,929
Let me go!

118
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,429
What's your name?

119
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:48,429
Katsutoshi Kusaka.

120
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,329
His initial is also "K".

121
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:57,029
"Beika Police Station"

122
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:00,129
Is this knife yours?

123
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:02,929
It... it's mine all right.

124
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:05,129
But, I didn't do it.

125
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:09,629
Why did you go to Mr. Ooka's house in the first place?

126
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:11,629
That's...

127
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:15,429
I was in fact being blackmailed by Ooka.

128
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,829
It's been 7 years ago already.

129
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:23,829
I got hooked on mahjong gambling.

130
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:26,329
The mahjong parlor was raided by the police

131
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:29,629
and being a customer there I was also arrested.

132
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:32,029
Ooka was also a regular there.

133
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:35,329
He was lucky and wasn't arrested.

134
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:38,729
Since then, I've gone completely clean, quit gambling,

135
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:40,929
and worked as a good citizen.

136
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:44,429
And yet I ran into that guy coicidentally

137
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:45,729
at a supermarket 2 years ago in Haidocho

138
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:47,529
and he's been blackmailing me since.

139
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:49,329
He began blackmailing you?

140
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,929
Yes. Every single month.

141
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:56,229
Half a year ago, talks on my daughter's marriage were about to settle,

142
00:08:56,229 --> 00:09:00,129
and since then, he began demanding more cash.

143
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:03,429
He appeared at a hotel in Shiomi the other day

144
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:05,829
when we were having lunch with my daughter's groom-to-be's family.

145
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:10,029
He said that he had a temporary security guard job nearby.

146
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:11,429
If things go on as is,

147
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:14,529
my daughter's marriage talks would go to shambles.

148
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:18,829
I just couldn't bear thinking about it.

149
00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:24,529
Did you go to the victim's house today to give him the money?

150
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:28,729
I usually give it to him at the end of the month after I get paid,

151
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:30,129
but since he demanded that I give him cash

152
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:32,029
for riding the Bullet train because an old friend of his died,

153
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,129
and he had to attend the funeral.

154
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:38,929
Instead of money I brought a knife.

155
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:41,629
But while I was struggling with him,

156
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:43,529
I slashed his hand

157
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,229
Seeing the blood splatter...

158
00:09:45,229 --> 00:09:46,729
I suddenly got scared,

159
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:49,529
I threw the knife down and fled.

160
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:53,729
That's really all there is to it.

161
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:56,329
That young lady must've come after me.

162
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,529
I'm sure she's the one who did it!

163
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:02,429
We found it inside your knapsack.

164
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:05,929
The contents is something that is extremely dangerous for the body.

165
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:09,729
You're a pharmacist, aren't you?

166
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:12,529
Did you steal it from the pharmacy that you work for?

167
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:16,329
That guy...

168
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:18,829
He's to blame!

169
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:20,729
I graduated last year,

170
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:23,429
but I couldn't find a job,

171
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:26,029
so I sort of had a nervous break down

172
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,229
and began shoplifting repeatedly.

173
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,229
He caught me doing so,

174
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:33,629
and told me that he'd overlook it, so to give him money.

175
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:35,329
Since then, I've been paying him every month.

176
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:38,129
After I landed myself a job,

177
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:41,229
he demanded that I pay him double of what I already was.

178
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:44,429
He used to come out of his way to my work place

179
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:47,629
and got his drugs prscribed there.

180
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:51,129
Just to think that I would be blackmailed by him all my life...

181
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:57,829
So I hoped that he would fall ill of some grave disease or something.

182
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:02,529
Did you stop by at the victim's house to pay him money?

183
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,729
I always pay him at the beginning of the month,

184
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:07,529
but he suddenly told me since a friend of his in his hometown died

185
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:08,729
and he had to go to the funeral,

186
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:10,029
he wanted me to pay for his hotel charges.

187
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:14,229
But, all I did was break his cell phone.

188
00:11:14,229 --> 00:11:17,029
Because the scene of my shoplifting was inside it.

189
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:18,329
It's true!

190
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:22,029
I'm sure that the man who came before me is the culprit, I'm sure!

191
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:27,929
Who would've thought that the victim was a blackmailer.

192
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:29,729
According to Mr. Kusaka,

193
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:32,829
Mr. Ooka was hoooked on a casino abroad.

194
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:33,929
Casino?

195
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:37,229
He probably blackmailed in order to make money for that.

196
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:40,429
Going to casinos with the money he blackmailed?

197
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:42,529
What a guy...

198
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:47,829
This calendar is Mr. Ooka's, right?

199
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:49,229
No, Conan.

200
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:52,529
There are strange things written in here and there.

201
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:54,329
What could it be?

202
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:57,429
Is it some code or what?

203
00:11:57,429 --> 00:12:01,129
It probably has something to do with his blackmailing though.

204
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:07,029
You're going to be a police detective from next month.

205
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:09,429
You'd better get used to this atmosphere from now.

206
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,329
Yes, sir.

207
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:13,429
Hey, your cap's soiled.

208
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:23,829
There was no one in the room

209
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:28,029
and all the windows were locked from the inside, were they not?

210
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:30,629
Yes, sir. Exactly.

211
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:32,829
In other words, the only ones who could've

212
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:35,529
gone in and out of of the crime site were these two?

213
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:37,429
Katsutoshi Kusaka

214
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:39,729
and Kiwako Kaitani...

215
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:42,629
the culprit is one of the two.

216
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:47,307
Which means one of the two is lying.

217
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:51,407
Something doesn't seem right.

218
00:12:51,407 --> 00:12:53,407
In order to avoid splattered blood,

219
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,707
the culprit used a cushion.

220
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:59,707
I wonder if those two could ever commit a crime so calmly?

221
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:01,861
Come to think of it...

222
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:04,261
Did you find the post crown?

223
00:13:05,461 --> 00:13:07,261
You keep out of this, kid!

224
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:10,161
But, it bothers me.

225
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:12,961
It wasn't found on the site.

226
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:16,061
If it came off when he struggled with the culprit,

227
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,961
there is a possibility that it's on th eclothes of the culprit.

228
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:21,261
There was none on the clothes of the two.

229
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:23,761
It's thinkable that Mr. Kusaka who left the site once,

230
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,961
could've disposed of it somewhere.

231
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:29,061
Officer Takagi and Sato,

232
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:31,461
go and continue interrogating the two.

233
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:35,361
Officer Chiba, go and check on the associates of the victim.

234
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:38,561
There may be other blackmail victims too.

235
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:39,561
Yes, sir.

236
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:43,961
"Maru" Oka?

237
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:53,561
So, I see.

238
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:56,861
If so, what on earth does that "K" mean?

239
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:04,161
Why is it a place like this?

240
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:08,461
I see, I got.

241
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:18,361
Mr. Mouri?

242
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,561
Inspector, it's getting late

243
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:26,561
so I guess it's about time to get to the bottom of things.

244
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:29,061
What? Did you figure out who the culprit is?

245
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:30,261
Yes, sir.

246
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:32,761
I shall tell you what really happened from now,

247
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:36,261
so will you please bring the two suspects here?

248
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:37,561
The two?

249
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:46,361
You're the only people who went in and out of the site of the crime

250
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:47,961
after Mr. Ooka returned home.

251
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:49,461
I didn't do it!

252
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:50,861
Me niether!

253
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:55,061
The letter "K" was found written at the scene.

254
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,461
It is highly unlikely that either one of you wrote it

255
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:59,161
to confuse the investigation.

256
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:03,861
Therefore, it's hightly probable that it was a dying message

257
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,561
that was written by the victim.

258
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:08,161
But, both their initials are "K",

259
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:10,261
it's hard to determine which of the two the killer is, on this alone...

260
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:16,461
Mr. Kusaka, weren't you paying Mr. Ooka on the 27th of each month?

261
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:17,661
Yes.

262
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:19,461
You, on the 5th, right, Ms. Kaitani?

263
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,561
Yes, that's right.

264
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:25,561
Wasn't it the 8th that Mr. Ooka appeared at the hotel in Shiomi?

265
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:27,061
Exactly.

266
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:30,761
Mr. Ooka came to the pharmacy on the 17th, didn't he?

267
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:32,861
How did you know?

268
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:35,961
It's all written in on the calendar.

269
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:38,761
Calendar? You mean that code?

270
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:42,661
Please look at the name tape of Mr. Ooka's notebook.

271
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:46,961
Zero "oka".

272
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:49,261
That's read "Ooka".

273
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:52,461
It's not zero, but rather, the alphabet "O".

274
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:54,461
Mr. Ooka seems to have had the habit of writing

275
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:55,961
in the names of people and places,

276
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:59,361
symbolizing them with letters of the alphabet and numbers.

277
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:02,261
Are you saying that, the code "9A" (kyu A) that is written in on the 27th,

278
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,961
"89" on the 5th,

279
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:08,561
symbolize Mr. Kusaka and Ms. Kaitani?

280
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:10,761
The name Kusaka if read in Chinse style,

281
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,661
is read "Kyuei" (9A).

282
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:16,161
Ms. Kaitani is a pharmacist.

283
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:19,761
The letter 89 (yaku) is used to refer to the word pharmaceutical,

284
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:22,361
and he added the word woman.

285
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:25,761
I see, so the number "403"

286
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:28,661
is shiomi if read in Japanese style.

287
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:32,961
So, the code "100" written in on the 17th

288
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:34,861
should be read "Jyuo" (10+O)...

289
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,761
which stands for pharmacy in Jyuo.

290
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:39,761
I see.

291
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:43,061
If so, the "K" that was found at the site...

292
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:47,261
It's neither Katsutoshi Kusaka nor Kiwako Kaitani.

293
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:49,761
That stands for...

294
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:51,961
of Keikan meaning police officer in Japanese!

295
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:56,761
The culprit is you, Officer Tateno!

296
00:16:59,161 --> 00:17:01,161
Officer Tateno is the culprit?

297
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:02,461
No way.

298
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:05,061
Please wait.

299
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:07,161
If that were to really stand for the "K" of Keikan-police officer,

300
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:09,061
why would that make me the culprit?

301
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,861
When the corpse was found,

302
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:11,961
you went into the house

303
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:14,361
saying that you're going to check if there were any suspicious people

304
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:17,261
and headed first of all for the kitchen.

305
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:18,761
Isn't that strange?

306
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:20,761
Why didn't you check the room on the opposite side

307
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:22,361
which was the closest first of all?

308
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:24,761
Well...

309
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:28,661
Back then, you went to lock the kitchen door.

310
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:30,661
The kitchen door that you went in

311
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:32,561
and out of when you committed the crime.

312
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:34,061
That trash dump guy,

313
00:17:34,061 --> 00:17:36,661
I'll bet that was you too.

314
00:17:36,661 --> 00:17:38,661
Since you wanted to avoid being suspected of loitering around the area

315
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:41,861
while gathering information on Mr. Ooka,

316
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,961
you made it look as if you were frequently patroling that area.

317
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:47,661
That's how you found out that Mr. Kusaka

318
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:50,561
and Ms. Kaitani would be visiting Mr. Ooka.

319
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:54,661
Taking advantage of this, you schemed up a plan to kill Mr. Ooka.

320
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:56,461
Wrong.

321
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:59,461
After Mr. Kusaka left the site,

322
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:02,161
you snuck into the house from the kitchen door,

323
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:06,161
killed Mr. Ooka then left again from the same door.

324
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:10,761
Then, you appeared before Mrs. Hanazawa as if nothing had happened.

325
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:13,161
That's all nonsense!

326
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:15,061
Do you have any proof?

327
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,961
There was something on your cap, wasn't there?

328
00:18:19,361 --> 00:18:21,561
Wasn't it sugar?

329
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:24,661
Ants were gathered where you're standing.

330
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:28,061
True.

331
00:18:28,061 --> 00:18:30,861
There was sugar spilled at the site.

332
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,861
When you killed Mr. Ooka,

333
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,261
your cap came off, didn't it?

334
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:37,361
And fell on the sugar.

335
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:38,861
Nothing of that sort...

336
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:39,961
One more thing.

337
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:42,361
When you brushed the cap off,

338
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:45,561
you faced the soiled part downward and brushed it off, right?

339
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:48,561
I thought it was strange.

340
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:52,861
Maybe you've got a reason for not wanting to flip your cap over?

341
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,561
Well...

342
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:56,861
If my deduction is correct,

343
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:59,561
Mr. Ooka's post crown that disappeared from site...

344
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:01,861
is inside your cap.

345
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:06,561
Officer Tateno, take off your cap.

346
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:07,961
Oh, well...

347
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:13,461
Here it is!

348
00:19:13,461 --> 00:19:15,561
It's highly likely

349
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:17,461
that Mr. Ooka's post crown that fell off

350
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:20,261
fell in to your cap that came off.

351
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:22,061
When I mentioned this,

352
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,661
you realized it,

353
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:25,861
and not wanting the post crown to fall out,

354
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:28,261
you couldn't turn your cap upside down.

355
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:33,861
Officer Tateno, why did you do something like that?

356
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:38,661
Answer me, Officer Tateno!

357
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:44,661
The fact is, when I was still a student,

358
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:47,161
I used to be a regular and gambled playing mahjong

359
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:49,461
at the same parlor where Mr. Kusaka used to go.

360
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:55,661
I, like Ooka, lucky was spared being arrested.

361
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,461
But, since then I changed my ways,

362
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:02,361
studied hard and became a police officer.

363
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:04,061
But six months ago,

364
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:07,961
I ran into Ooka who was working as a security guard at a supermarket

365
00:20:07,961 --> 00:20:10,161
where I went to pick up a shoplifter.

366
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:14,061
But, wasn't Mr. Ooka's work place in Haidocho?

367
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:15,961
It seems he came in as a substitute

368
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:17,761
for a security guard who called in sick.

369
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:20,061
He remembered me.

370
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:24,061
And he startled blackmailing me.

371
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:27,961
You were giving him money every month on the 11th?

372
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,461
The character that was written on the calendar

373
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:33,161
is something you wrote in

374
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:34,761
by adding the left part on to the letter "K", isn't it?

375
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:36,261
That's right.

376
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:38,661
Every month since then...

377
00:20:40,061 --> 00:20:41,361
Last month,

378
00:20:41,361 --> 00:20:43,961
I got a notice that I would be transferred to the Detective section.

379
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:45,561
When Ooka found out about this,

380
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:48,761
he started demanding even more money.

381
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:50,561
Officer Tateno...

382
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:56,161
I investigated and found that there were many more victims.

383
00:20:56,161 --> 00:21:01,161
I figured I couldn't let him go on the way he was.

384
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:05,061
That's right, I punished him.

385
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:08,461
To save all the people who were made to suffer because of him.

386
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:10,261
In the name of justice!

387
00:21:11,461 --> 00:21:14,761
This punishment in the name of justice!

388
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:18,561
Don't you dare claim justice with that mouth of yours!

389
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:20,361
No matter how you put it,

390
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:22,561
what you did is commit homicide!

391
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:25,261
It's nothing more than a dirty crime.

392
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:28,561
And the stupid crime that you committed threw dirt

393
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:30,761
and hurt the pride of all the 290,000 officers

394
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:33,761
there are throughout the nation!

395
00:21:33,761 --> 00:21:38,461
You don't have a tinge of a right to claim justice!

396
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:50,761
Sumio Tateno, you're under arrest on murder charge!

397
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:16,561
I am very sorry to have caused you both a great discomfort

398
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,061
because of this case.

399
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:19,861
Don't be...

400
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:22,861
However, Mr. Kusaka, you will be charged with assault,

401
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:26,261
and Ms. Kitani, you will be arrested on charges of burglary.

402
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:27,561
Do you understand?

403
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:28,761
Yes.

404
00:23:28,761 --> 00:23:30,761
I understand.

405
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:32,461
One mistake

406
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:37,761
and either of you may have committed the same crime as Tateno.

407
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:39,861
Keep that in mind,

408
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:42,361
and after compensating for each of your crimes respectively,

409
00:23:42,361 --> 00:23:43,661
go on and live a righteous life.

410
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:45,461
Yes.

411
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:47,361
I'm very sorry.

412
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:57,461
Mr. Mouri, please take over.

413
00:23:57,461 --> 00:24:00,261
We've got to hurry or her life may be in danger.

414
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:03,361
Darn, the noise...

415
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:04,661
The guys upstairs.

416
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:10,661
She was killed, wasn't she?

417
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:15,561
She's not the victim?

418
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:17,561
She's the assaulter.

419
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:20,661
