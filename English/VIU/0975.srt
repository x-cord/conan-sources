1
00:00:02,445 --> 00:00:03,525
Excuse me.

2
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:06,024
Your help is appreciated.

3
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:07,025
Excuse me.

4
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:09,184
I'm looking for my wife.

5
00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:11,025
Your help is appreciated.

6
00:00:11,465 --> 00:00:12,615
Please.

7
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:17,535
Excuse me. I'm looking for my wi—

8
00:00:30,215 --> 00:00:31,355
Tomomi...

9
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:53,785
Tomomi!

10
00:00:56,345 --> 00:00:57,504
Excuse me.

11
00:00:57,505 --> 00:01:00,735
May I take a flyer?

12
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:03,504
Yes. Here you go.

13
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:05,315
Could I see one, too?

14
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:07,435
Here.

15
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:08,795
Thank you.

16
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,675
Huh? This woman...

17
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:15,114
You know her, Ran-neechan?

18
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:15,955
Yeah.

19
00:01:15,956 --> 00:01:20,124
She works at the florist in the shopping center, right?

20
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,605
Th-That's right! That's her!

21
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:24,825
Have you seen her anywhere?

22
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:29,815
I don't know where she's been since she came home from the florist three days ago.

23
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:41,114
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

24
00:01:41,115 --> 00:01:42,824
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

25
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:44,704
A strange mystery lies in the flyers

26
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,704
passed out by a desperate man standing on a street corner searching for his wife!

27
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:48,324
Always determining the one truth

28
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:50,224
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

29
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:52,505
his name is Detective Conan!

30
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:36,524
The Secret of the Search for His Wife

31
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:39,785
Mori Detective Agency

32
00:03:40,244 --> 00:03:41,554
I see.

33
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:44,703
So this is one of those flyers.

34
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:45,874
Please!

35
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:49,304
Please find Tomomi—my wife!

36
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,034
Please!

37
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:55,113
He was desperately looking for her in this rain.

38
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:56,694
At least do something for him.

39
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:59,203
Easier said than done.

40
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:01,993
It's only been three days since she went missing, right?

41
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:05,073
Maybe she'll return if you wait a little longer.

42
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:06,114
But...

43
00:04:06,324 --> 00:04:08,663
People run away from home all the time.

44
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:11,893
Are you sure you didn't do something to upset her?

45
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:15,593
Maybe you stood her up because you got caught up playing mahjong.

46
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:16,813
Are you talking about yourself?

47
00:04:16,814 --> 00:04:17,254
What?

48
00:04:18,974 --> 00:04:19,964
No.

49
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:25,264
She's the one who didn't show up that day.

50
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:29,264
What? The Beika Center Building's observation tower and restaurant?

51
00:04:29,494 --> 00:04:30,264
Yeah.

52
00:04:30,514 --> 00:04:34,473
I'm surprised you got a reservation at such a fancy restaurant.

53
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,644
Tomorrow is special.

54
00:04:36,994 --> 00:04:38,274
I'm so happy!

55
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:42,404
It was our wedding anniversary.

56
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:45,044
I made a reservation at a restaurant.

57
00:04:45,864 --> 00:04:51,014
She was genuinely excited since it wasn't the type of restaurant we could normally visit.

58
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:57,414
So she couldn't have run away!

59
00:04:58,894 --> 00:05:03,214
Besides, her phone and wallet were left in the living room.

60
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:06,344
Have you told the police?

61
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:08,393
Of course I told them.

62
00:05:08,394 --> 00:05:11,463
But they couldn't say for certain if a crime took place.

63
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:12,724
I see.

64
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:17,634
I'm worried she was kidnapped or got caught up in something.

65
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:20,234
I'm just so anxious.

66
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:21,904
Dad.

67
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:25,114
Very well. I'll take on your case.

68
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,614
Thank you!

69
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,614
Really, thank you!

70
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:31,844
I appreciate your help!

71
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:40,793
That husband looks like he's going to break before his wife is found.

72
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:42,763
Try to find her soon.

73
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:44,634
I know.

74
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,643
That said,

75
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:52,824
all I can do is question her workplace and neighbors.

76
00:05:53,444 --> 00:05:58,993
Tomomi-san went missing three days ago on Wednesday.

77
00:05:58,994 --> 00:06:01,904
That's the day after the photo on the flyer was taken.

78
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:05,654
She left her job at the florist at 2 PM.

79
00:06:06,214 --> 00:06:08,704
Her date with Higuchi-san was at seven.

80
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:11,804
It was a weekday afternoon.

81
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:14,623
It'd be convenient if someone saw her.

82
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:14,914
Ow!

83
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:16,913
You followed me again, brat?

84
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:18,283
Why not?

85
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:22,924
I think people will be more relaxed and willing to speak to you if I'm around.

86
00:06:25,314 --> 00:06:30,233
Well, if you're going to beg, not even Mori Kogoro is heartless enough to turn you away.

87
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:33,273
You can tag along, but don't get in my way.

88
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:35,144
I'm not begging.

89
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:39,444
This is Higuchi-san's house.

90
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:44,613
Let's start by questioning his next door neighbor.

91
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:45,374
Yeah.

92
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:47,753
Three days ago?

93
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:48,574
Yes.

94
00:06:48,874 --> 00:06:53,633
I saw Tomomi-san return from work.

95
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:55,054
What time?

96
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:58,083
I think it was around 2:30.

97
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,084
Did you notice anything unusual then?

98
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:04,343
No. She was her usual self.

99
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:08,594
She seemed happy and said she'd be having dinner at a restaurant that night.

100
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:13,724
Did you see any suspicious people or vehicles around here that day?

101
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,224
I can't recall.

102
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:23,153
Recently I've been so forgetful.

103
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:26,234
I remember the distant past so well, though.

104
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:29,413
Does that mean you didn't hear any suspicious sounds either?

105
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:30,734
No.

106
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:34,553
Besides, if that kind of sound were made in a residential neighborhood like this one,

107
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,683
people would've made a fuss.

108
00:07:36,684 --> 00:07:38,124
You're right.

109
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,573
I don't know.

110
00:07:40,574 --> 00:07:43,624
I don't interact much with the people who live around here.

111
00:07:50,174 --> 00:07:51,383
Damn it!

112
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:53,823
There isn't a single clue.

113
00:07:53,824 --> 00:07:58,493
All we learned is that she was looking forward to eating at the restaurant.

114
00:07:58,494 --> 00:07:59,394
Yeah.

115
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:03,274
Let's try asking around behind Higuchi-san's house next.

116
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:07,154
Higuchi-san's wife?

117
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:12,154
I didn't see her that day, but last week I saw her by the Teimuzu River.

118
00:08:12,654 --> 00:08:14,373
Last week?

119
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:16,664
How did she seem?

120
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:21,794
It seemed like she was arguing with her husband, so I didn't speak to her.

121
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:24,173
Arguing with her husband?

122
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:25,044
Yeah.

123
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:31,744
She was saying ominous things like "let me live tonight" and "kill me tomorrow."

124
00:08:33,524 --> 00:08:36,804
I did hear shouting.

125
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:39,303
From Higuchi-san's house?

126
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:40,304
Yes.

127
00:08:40,714 --> 00:08:43,213
They often argued at night.

128
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:46,314
It seems like those two didn't get along.

129
00:08:46,674 --> 00:08:49,494
Did the wife run away or something?

130
00:08:50,194 --> 00:08:54,194
Yes, I did see her fighting with her husband

131
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:58,443
on Sunday in the park next to Higuchi-san's house.

132
00:08:58,444 --> 00:09:00,493
How exactly were they fighting?

133
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:01,703
Well...

134
00:09:01,704 --> 00:09:03,584
"Send me away!"

135
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:07,103
Hey! Go finish your homework.

136
00:09:07,104 --> 00:09:08,393
Okay.

137
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:10,584
Uh, what was that?

138
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,844
I'm sorry. That's actually what she was screaming.

139
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:18,344
Higuchi-san's wife shouted that at him.

140
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,804
Did something happen to Higuchi-san's family?

141
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:30,604
Please leave!

142
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:32,243
Who are you people?

143
00:09:32,244 --> 00:09:33,373
That's Higuchi-san's voice.

144
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:33,984
Yeah.

145
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:36,193
You said you were the police,

146
00:09:36,194 --> 00:09:38,793
so I thought you came to investigate Tomomi's disappearance.

147
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:40,993
Is something the matter, Higuchi-san?

148
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:42,044
Mori-san!

149
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:44,373
What's all the fuss, Takagi?

150
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:48,803
We just received an anonymous tip.

151
00:09:48,804 --> 00:09:54,254
This officer is saying I murdered Tomomi and buried her body in the yard!

152
00:09:57,984 --> 00:09:59,624
Well then, Higuchi-san.

153
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:01,594
May we begin?

154
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:04,394
Just get it over with quickly.

155
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:06,763
Go ahead. Get started.

156
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:07,394
Yes, sir.

157
00:10:10,804 --> 00:10:12,904
You won't find a body.

158
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:16,904
First of all, Tomomi isn't dead.

159
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:24,664
We found something, Detective Takagi. A woman's body.

160
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:28,054
N-No!

161
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:30,174
Tomomi!

162
00:10:30,174 --> 00:10:30,834
Don't!

163
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:35,344
I understand how you feel, but please stay away from the body.

164
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:39,714
Tomomi...

165
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,874
Tomomi!

166
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,627
The victim is Higuchi Tomomi-san, twenty-nine years old.

167
00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:01,888
She's a housewife who lived in this house.

168
00:11:02,356 --> 00:11:07,185
We believe the cause of death is blood loss after being stabbed in the abdomen

169
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:10,556
with these pruning shears buried along with the body.

170
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:16,036
That man over there is the victim's husband Higuchi Masaki-san.

171
00:11:16,436 --> 00:11:17,815
I see.

172
00:11:17,816 --> 00:11:20,295
And at Mori-san's recommendation,

173
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:23,536
we've had several of the neighbors come to serve as witnesses.

174
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:27,346
Higuchi-san, according to the tip,

175
00:11:27,676 --> 00:11:31,795
you murdered your wife and buried her in your yard.

176
00:11:31,796 --> 00:11:33,346
There must be some mistake!

177
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:36,035
I would never murder Tomomi!

178
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:38,106
It's not possible!

179
00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:42,525
You can tell us all about it at the station.

180
00:11:42,526 --> 00:11:43,496
Takagi-kun.

181
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:44,236
Yes, sir.

182
00:11:44,456 --> 00:11:45,466
Mori-san.

183
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:48,326
Mori-san...

184
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:04,206
What's this?

185
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:09,006
I don't believe it. "Look for my wife?" Yeah, right.

186
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:10,886
Hey, Mori-kun!

187
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:14,235
According to your neighbors, you and your wife had a terrible relationship.

188
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:17,646
They said you fought about whether or not you'd kill her.

189
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:21,646
Wait a minute. We never fought.

190
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:24,895
And I thought you were innocent.

191
00:12:24,896 --> 00:12:28,776
But over the course of making inquiries, I became certain you did it.

192
00:12:31,756 --> 00:12:35,406
Why? Why is this happening?

193
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:39,026
I was completely fooled by your act.

194
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:41,495
Takagi-kun.

195
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:42,675
Yes, sir.

196
00:12:42,676 --> 00:12:44,626
Please stand up.

197
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:47,296
Hold it right there.

198
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:49,255
What is it, Mori-kun?

199
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:51,486
What? Who, me?

200
00:12:57,926 --> 00:13:02,936
I've figured out the true culprit who murdered Tomomi-san.

201
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:09,946
Hey, didn't you just say you were fooled by Higuchi-san's acting?

202
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:14,895
Yes, but it wasn't me who was fooled by his acting.

203
00:13:14,896 --> 00:13:16,956
It's those people standing over there.

204
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,456
What?

205
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:24,956
These people are the neighbors who testified that Higuchi-san argued with Tomomi-san.

206
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:29,216
All three of them clearly remembered what they argued about.

207
00:13:29,706 --> 00:13:34,346
I remembered because their argument sounded so ominous.

208
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:40,266
After all, she was screaming "let me live tonight" and "kill me tomorrow."

209
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:41,745
Me, too.

210
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:44,905
I heard her screaming "forgive me" and "don't kill me" in the middle of the night.

211
00:13:44,906 --> 00:13:49,026
When I heard them arguing, she was screaming, "send me away."

212
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,776
That's...

213
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:51,926
Yes.

214
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:55,406
"Kill me tomorrow—but let me live tonight."

215
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:56,576
What?

216
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:58,156
Don't you recognize them?

217
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:03,166
They're lines spoken by Desdemona in Shakespeare's "Othello."

218
00:14:03,346 --> 00:14:05,555
What? "Othello"?

219
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:09,046
That's right. We weren't arguing.

220
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:11,526
We were rehearsing.

221
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:12,916
Conan.

222
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,296
Here.

223
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:16,135
Conan-kun?

224
00:14:16,136 --> 00:14:18,635
Look. It's written here, too.

225
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:19,496
What?

226
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:21,746
You're right.

227
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:26,065
Tomomi-san was part of a community theater.

228
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,186
Y-Yes.

229
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:28,916
That day...

230
00:14:32,116 --> 00:14:34,226
Hey, look.

231
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:37,446
What is it?

232
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:40,836
Something great happened today.

233
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:47,105
It was the first time she'd been given a big role.

234
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:48,956
She was so excited.

235
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:53,975
So you went to the riverside and park to rehearse together.

236
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,165
Yes.

237
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,965
We couldn't speak loudly at home.

238
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,546
You thought you'd bother the neighbors.

239
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,976
But doesn't that make things a little strange?

240
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:09,706
Sakie-san's testimony, which claimed she heard you rehearsing at night...

241
00:15:11,156 --> 00:15:12,136
You're right.

242
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:13,606
I-I...

243
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,675
I just made a mistake.

244
00:15:15,676 --> 00:15:18,616
No, it wasn't a mistake.

245
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:21,996
You deliberately gave false testimony.

246
00:15:22,236 --> 00:15:25,885
Why would I lie?

247
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:30,855
Because you're the true culprit who murdered Tomomi-san

248
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:33,005
with the pruning shears.

249
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:33,876
What?

250
00:15:35,706 --> 00:15:37,835
Wh-What are you talking about?

251
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:41,056
She just lives in the house behind mine.

252
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:46,265
I didn't have any motive to kill her.

253
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:51,276
The flyers made by Higuchi-san told me the answer to that.

254
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:54,175
These missing person flyers?

255
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:55,196
Yes.

256
00:15:55,526 --> 00:16:00,266
This photo was taken the day before Tomomi-san went missing.

257
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:05,115
Look closely at the picture. Notice anything?

258
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:06,875
Notice anything?

259
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:10,205
There doesn't seem to be anything unnatural.

260
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:15,256
Look at the fragrant olive tree behind Tomomi-san.

261
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:19,716
See how the branches are currently shorter than they are in the photo?

262
00:16:20,886 --> 00:16:22,176
You're right.

263
00:16:22,936 --> 00:16:24,936
Tomomi-san cut them

264
00:16:25,446 --> 00:16:28,976
using the pruning shears used as the murder weapon.

265
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:30,535
Come to think of it,

266
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:35,396
she said she wanted to cut them because they cast a shadow on her kitchen garden.

267
00:16:35,856 --> 00:16:40,375
But how is that a reason to murder Tomomi?

268
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:42,996
It's perfectly plausible.

269
00:16:43,196 --> 00:16:47,996
Neighborhood disputes over whether or not to cut branches can become quite serious.

270
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:52,376
It's not unusual for them to turn into lawsuits.

271
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:54,505
That's right,

272
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:59,636
but Tomomi-san cut the olive branches without realizing that.

273
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:05,886
Sakie-san, you became furious and stabbed Tomomi-san with those pruning shears.

274
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:09,565
Wait a minute! I cut those branches!

275
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:10,896
Huh?

276
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:15,686
But all the flowers in your yard are dead.

277
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:18,026
You're right.

278
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,545
Judging by the state of your yard,

279
00:17:20,546 --> 00:17:25,656
it's hard to imagine that you gardened on a regular basis.

280
00:17:27,406 --> 00:17:28,675
That's right!

281
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:31,085
She's the one who cut the branches!

282
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:32,805
But so, what?

283
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:36,295
That doesn't prove that I killed her!

284
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:38,745
Y-Yes, but...

285
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:41,296
Mori-kun, is there proof?

286
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:42,955
Of course.

287
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:45,805
Furious at having your branches cut,

288
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:49,295
you didn't go to the trouble of using the gate to enter the yard.

289
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:51,125
What are you saying?

290
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:57,155
In other words, you climbed over that rose bush.

291
00:17:57,156 --> 00:18:00,196
H-How do you know that?!

292
00:18:00,606 --> 00:18:02,066
The scratches on your legs.

293
00:18:02,526 --> 00:18:04,796
Did you not get those then?

294
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:13,385
When I looked at the bushes earlier, there was just one area unnaturally devoid of roses.

295
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:14,955
That's how I knew.

296
00:18:14,956 --> 00:18:19,085
Takagi-kun, doesn't the photo on the flyer show roses in this spot?

297
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:22,615
Huh? Yes, there are roses there.

298
00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:26,085
Huh? There's something that looks like blood on these thorns.

299
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:27,346
What?

300
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,145
Go get the forensics team waiting outside!

301
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:30,896
Yes, sir!

302
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:36,226
If examined, I'm sure it will match your blood.

303
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:43,236
Will you tell us why you climbed over the bushes to enter another home's yard?

304
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:45,195
I-I...

305
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:46,196
Inspector Megure.

306
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:47,706
What is it?

307
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:54,955
There was blood other than the victim's on the weapon.

308
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:59,236
It's almost certainly your blood.

309
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:04,006
You can wipe away fingerprints, but the blood remains.

310
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:06,146
It's a shame.

311
00:19:10,096 --> 00:19:13,266
Did she call in the anonymous tip, too?

312
00:19:13,556 --> 00:19:18,045
Definitely. She wouldn't have been exposed if she hadn't reported it.

313
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:24,756
She probably thought she could frame Higuchi since we were questioning the neighborhood.

314
00:19:25,576 --> 00:19:26,906
That's right.

315
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:31,036
I was going to frame you!

316
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:32,786
Why would you do that?

317
00:19:32,976 --> 00:19:38,546
I was sick and tired you seeing you happily fiddle with your garden day after day!

318
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:44,046
And ultimately, you even ended up messing with another person's tree!

319
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:51,235
Hey, you!

320
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:52,176
Yes?

321
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,936
What are you doing?

322
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:58,775
Your branches are growing into our yard, so I thought I would cut—

323
00:19:58,776 --> 00:20:01,455
Don't touch my tree!

324
00:20:01,456 --> 00:20:03,196
I-I'm sorry.

325
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:06,135
But the branches are crowding each other.

326
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:08,775
It would be better if you pruned them.

327
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:10,576
Don't you feel bad for the tree?

328
00:20:10,846 --> 00:20:12,335
What did you say?

329
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,666
It's none of your business!

330
00:20:20,476 --> 00:20:23,025
You're always looking down on me!

331
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:24,265
Who do you think you are?!

332
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:28,466
In any case, we'll hear what you have to say once we return to the station.

333
00:20:29,606 --> 00:20:31,096
Hold on.

334
00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:33,326
That's...

335
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:36,975
That's why you killed Tomomi?

336
00:20:36,976 --> 00:20:37,726
Crap!

337
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:40,516
Wait, Higuchi-san! Calm down!

338
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:42,316
Stop, Higuchi-san!

339
00:20:43,796 --> 00:20:45,605
Think about it.

340
00:20:45,606 --> 00:20:48,816
Doing that won't make your wife happy.

341
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:54,896
Tomomi...

342
00:20:56,676 --> 00:20:59,746
Something great happened today.

343
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:03,836
I finally got a big role.

344
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:06,485
What are you doing?

345
00:21:06,486 --> 00:21:10,346
I was planting herb seeds.

346
00:21:10,546 --> 00:21:12,886
These herbs are supposed to be good for your throat.

347
00:21:16,846 --> 00:21:17,946
Tomomi...

348
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,476
Tomomi...

349
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,106
Tomomi...

350
00:21:26,436 --> 00:21:28,046
Tomomi...

351
00:22:53,726 --> 00:22:55,496
Your help is appreciated!

352
00:22:56,226 --> 00:22:59,696
Please! I'm looking for my lost cat!

353
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:01,136
Excuse me.

354
00:23:01,966 --> 00:23:02,616
Yes?

355
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:05,125
May I take a flyer?

356
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:07,305
Yes! Thank you.

357
00:23:07,306 --> 00:23:08,915
Miss.

358
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:10,505
Dad.

359
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:15,225
Let the great Mori Kogoro find your missing cat for you.

360
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:18,056
I promise I'll find him.

361
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,395
It's the great detective!

362
00:23:21,396 --> 00:23:22,965
That's the Sleeping Kogoro!

363
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:23,726
Huh?

364
00:23:23,976 --> 00:23:25,955
Find my dog, too!

365
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:26,656
Huh?

366
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:28,405
And my turtle!

367
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,276
What?

368
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:30,855
And my goldfish!

369
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:31,985
What?!

370
00:23:31,986 --> 00:23:33,765
H-Hey, wait!

371
00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:36,166
Why don't you find all of them?

372
00:23:37,246 --> 00:23:39,105
Good luck, mister.

373
00:23:39,106 --> 00:23:41,996
Is there a goldfish in the local fish-inity?
