1
00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:05,063
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,064 --> 00:00:07,163
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,164 --> 00:00:08,863
Extra-marital affair, fortune-telling and Three Kingdoms.

4
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:11,063
Many things connect to the crime.

5
00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:12,563
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,564 --> 00:00:14,463
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,464 --> 00:00:16,364
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,884
Heiji, Pops and I will go to the residence of Ryoko Morozumi

9
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:04,384
on Haidocho 4-chome to conduct investigation

10
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:08,184
on behalf of Detective Kusukawa,

11
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:10,685
but she denied our help.

12
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:12,885
What?

13
00:02:12,886 --> 00:02:16,784
You just said you're headed home because you finished the job!

14
00:02:16,785 --> 00:02:19,484
Yeah, that's what we were planning to do,

15
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:22,584
but we passed a fire engine on the way back.

16
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:24,584
We got concerned and headed back to the residence

17
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:26,984
and found it blazing outrageously.

18
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:27,985
What?

19
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:30,185
The Morozumi residence...

20
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:40,285
"Red Horse In The Fire (Investigation)"

21
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:44,484
I tell you, what is that idiot doing anyway.

22
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:46,684
I bought him a t-shirt

23
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:48,084
that I thought would look good on him and then...

24
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,885
Come, come. They'll be home soon.

25
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:55,084
What's this key holder?

26
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:59,284
Remember? A kindly looking old man gave it us on the bus.

27
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:02,484
Oh, the man who gave us his seat

28
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:04,884
saying that we looked to be carrying a heavy load.

29
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,084
Thank you so very much.

30
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,684
Thanks.

31
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:10,884
Where are you girls living?

32
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:12,384
Are you trying to pick us up, mister?

33
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:13,784
Kazuha, stop it!

34
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:17,784
No. I run an antique shop at Haidocho,

35
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:19,884
so I thought I'd like you to drop in one day.

36
00:03:19,885 --> 00:03:21,884
Haidocho is nearby.

37
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:25,284
My house is right next to it on Beikacho 5-chome.

38
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:28,384
"Takanori Genda (42)" -Oh, 5-chome.

39
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:30,884
-Shall we go tomorrow? -Okay, let's!

40
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:35,484
Okay, I'll give you the catalog of my shop and a key holder.

41
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:37,285
Promise, okay?

42
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,684
I wonder what a key holder

43
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:42,085
that brings flourishing business is all about.

44
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:45,284
"Police Headquarters" -Here you go, Mouri.

45
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:50,084
The four red horses that were found at the serial arson sites.

46
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:52,784
I went way out to ask the forensic officers for it,

47
00:03:52,785 --> 00:03:55,584
so you'd better find some sort of a clue, or you're going to get it.

48
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:59,384
Well, I'm not the one who want to see the horses, they do.

49
00:03:59,385 --> 00:04:01,884
Hey. I wonder why only the horse left at the first site

50
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:03,584
is burnt black like this?

51
00:04:03,585 --> 00:04:06,485
And only this horse has a stand.

52
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:10,384
There's something written on the back of the stand.

53
00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:11,984
Rabbit?

54
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,484
Hey. A red horse and rabbit...

55
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:16,984
Don't tell me that...

56
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:19,484
Hey. Isn't this Guan Yu?

57
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:21,184
Guan Yu is the military commander

58
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:22,684
who appears in the story "Three Kingdoms", isn't he?

59
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:24,884
Yes. And Guan Yu is also famous

60
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:26,984
for being the god of prosperity for doing business.

61
00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:30,284
But, what a flashy colored horse he's riding.

62
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:32,784
Well, this is the Red Rabbit Horse.

63
00:04:32,785 --> 00:04:36,685
It's a super horse said to be able to run a thousand miles in a day.

64
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:39,384
Red Rabbit Horse?

65
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:42,084
Are you saying that this red plastic horse

66
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:45,284
is a famous horse that appears in "Three Kingdoms"?

67
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,684
Yeah, that's right.

68
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:48,284
Try looking at the stand of this horse

69
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:50,784
that was left at the first scene of the fire.

70
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:53,084
You can't read the words above and under it because they're burnt,

71
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:56,085
but you can see the word "rabbit", right?

72
00:04:57,485 --> 00:04:59,284
Yes, true.

73
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:02,684
The only red horse with the word "rabbit" to its name

74
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:04,784
is the horse that ran around battlefields

75
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:06,584
with its vicious military commander on its back, Red Rabbit Horse, right?

76
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:09,684
But, why did the arsonist put the legendary horse

77
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:10,984
that appears in an old Chinese story

78
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:13,584
at the sites he set fire to?

79
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:15,384
Yeah, why?

80
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:16,784
China...

81
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:20,584
Feng Shui is also from China, isn't it?

82
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:24,584
The man who came to the Morozumi residence before the fire,

83
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:28,384
didn't he say anything to Ryoko about the old Chinese story?

84
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:30,884
He didn't say anything about the "Three Kingdoms",

85
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:33,884
but that Sensei of Feng Shui's got a perfect motive.

86
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:34,984
Huh?

87
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:38,384
He was looking for the video tape of his affair

88
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:41,984
with Ryoko Morozumi who died in the fire.

89
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:42,985
"Misao Soga (45)"

90
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:46,684
Don't tell me that you think he set the house on fire

91
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:49,284
in order to destroy the tape in the process?

92
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:50,985
Inspector Yuminaga.

93
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:57,484
Okay. If you find out anything more, please report to me again.

94
00:05:57,485 --> 00:05:58,785
Yes, sir.

95
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:05,484
It seems that the ones with motive is not limited to that Sensei.

96
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:07,184
Keiko Gondo, the fortune-teller

97
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:09,984
that came to the house before the Sensei...

98
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:12,084
Seems that she's going to get a large sum of estate from her parents

99
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:15,585
being that she's Ryoko's older sister.

100
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:18,984
Come to think of it, that fortune-teller

101
00:06:18,985 --> 00:06:21,684
was saying that their father just died.

102
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:25,684
But that lady came to borrow money from Ryoko.

103
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,484
If she was going to inherit the estate of her father anyway,

104
00:06:27,485 --> 00:06:29,284
why would she do something like that?

105
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:31,984
Her father was left to live alone when her mother died.

106
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:35,184
His only living relatives were his two daughters, Ryoko and Keiko.

107
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:39,484
He seems to have left a will saying that

108
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:41,784
he would leave his entire estate to Ryoko who had taken a husband,

109
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:43,284
who took after their family name Morozumi.

110
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:44,684
I see.

111
00:06:44,685 --> 00:06:46,784
So if Ryoko disappears,

112
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:51,084
the estate that she originally couldn't inherit would be hers.

113
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:52,184
Yeah.

114
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:53,784
Because there was nothing on the death note that said,

115
00:06:53,785 --> 00:06:57,584
if the younger sister dies, don't give it to the older sister.

116
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:01,284
If so, Ryoko's husband is clean.

117
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:04,784
If his wife dies, he loses the estate and all.

118
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:08,184
No, we can't assume that.

119
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:11,884
Her husband Akira Morozumi is a psychiatrist,

120
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:12,984
and wanted to demolish that house that they were living in

121
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:15,884
and build his own hospital.

122
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:17,384
But since Ryoko was opposed to it,

123
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:19,784
he seems to have been in a fix.

124
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:25,284
He seems to have been given that land and house by Ryoko's parents.

125
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:26,984
On top of that, if he knew that

126
00:07:26,985 --> 00:07:29,384
his wife was having an extra-marital affair,

127
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:31,284
he would have more than enough motive.

128
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:36,084
The problem is all three of them have an alibi.

129
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:38,284
Yeah. The time the arsonist set fire

130
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:41,785
and put this horse at the site was around 7:30 pm.

131
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:47,084
Her husband came home about 10 minutes before that,

132
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:49,684
but after that, before even a minute had passed,

133
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:53,184
he went out drinking with the Sensei of Feng Shui.

134
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:55,084
And at that time, the fortune-teller

135
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:58,785
was telling fortunes in a building in front of Haido Station.

136
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:02,284
The only suspect left is

137
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:05,684
the man who was at the front door

138
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,085
of the Morozumi residence when we got there.

139
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:11,884
The man who tried to leave the catalog of the things in his store

140
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:14,284
and key holder that would help business prosper,

141
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,884
but was asked to leave.

142
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:20,585
The owner of the antique store, that timid looking man...

143
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:24,685
Unless we can figure out who and where he is...

144
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:29,684
Hey. I wonder what this is?

145
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:31,884
See, this horse that was found at the first fire site,

146
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:34,085
only this horse has a strange protrusion on its body.

147
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:38,384
Isn't this the feet of a human?

148
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,984
It's melted from the heat of the fire,

149
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:42,284
but maybe somebody was mounted on this horse.

150
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:45,184
The military commander that was riding the Red Rabbit Horse was...

151
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:46,885
Who was he?

152
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:50,784
Guan... Guan Yu!

153
00:08:50,785 --> 00:08:51,785
Guan Yu?

154
00:08:51,786 --> 00:08:53,184
He's really suspicious after all,

155
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:56,284
that timid man with the round rim glasses.

156
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,284
Guan Yu is the god of prosperity in business.

157
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:02,084
The key holder box that the man tried to give away

158
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:05,284
is just the right size for this, too.

159
00:09:05,285 --> 00:09:07,084
There's no doubt about it.

160
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:10,284
Huh? The guy that was riding the Red Rabbit Horse was...

161
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:11,784
We don't have time to waste!

162
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:15,284
Let's call all the antique shops in the vicinity of Haidocho!

163
00:09:15,285 --> 00:09:17,385
We'd better hurry or he'll get away!

164
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:25,085
I hope that the man you guys say you saw isn't him.

165
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:29,184
Oh, no! It's already past 23:00!

166
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:32,384
We're all supposed to go to Tropical Land tomorrow and yet!

167
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:34,284
Maybe they aren't planning to come home?

168
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:37,084
Really, what are they doing dragging Conan around with them

169
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:38,884
till this hour of the day?

170
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:41,184
They get me so mad!

171
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:42,984
Let's just forget about those guys and go to sleep.

172
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:44,584
Wait.

173
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,584
Why don't we hang this sunny boy doll out

174
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:50,884
on the veranda of dad's room so that it doesn't rain tomorrow?

175
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:53,285
Although it didn't seem to work last night.

176
00:09:55,285 --> 00:09:58,084
I'm going to wish with all my might tonight so that it works.

177
00:09:58,085 --> 00:09:59,585
Yeah.

178
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:04,284
I've found them.

179
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:07,084
I've finally found them.

180
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:10,684
What? He once came up as a suspect?

181
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:12,084
Are you serious?

182
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:15,384
Yeah. His name is Takanori Genda.

183
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:20,284
He's running an antique shop in Haidocho, just as you assumed.

184
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:23,384
But why'd you suspect him?

185
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:28,184
He was among the crowd of onlookers at the fire site at Rizencho.

186
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:31,784
He was mumbling something strange while watching the fire.

187
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:34,784
He was saying, "Father..."

188
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:36,184
Father?

189
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:38,584
His father used to be a firefighter.

190
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:40,184
When he was still in elementary school,

191
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:41,884
his father tried to save a person

192
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:43,484
who couldn't make it out of the fire in time,

193
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:46,384
and was swallowed by the flames.

194
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:48,284
Don't tell me that the man is...

195
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:51,784
Yeah. We, the police thought so, too.

196
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:56,284
That he set fire in memory of his father.

197
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:58,784
That, maybe he thought that if he caused a fire,

198
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:01,185
his father would come dashing to the scene.

199
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:09,784
I see. So, not being able to give up hope,

200
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:12,384
he started setting fires from 1-chome in sequence,

201
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:16,085
and kept chasing the illusion of his father.

202
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:20,684
What? At 5:00 in the evening,

203
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:23,384
he stopped by at the shop once and then went home?

204
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:26,584
Yes, he said he was tired.

205
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,384
He's been distributing catalogs of our store and key holders

206
00:11:29,385 --> 00:11:32,784
to people in the neighborhood from morning, so...

207
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:36,384
Is that key holder the one with a person riding a red horse?

208
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:39,884
Yeah. It's his work of effort of the statue of Guan Yu.

209
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:41,784
But he changed it to another key holder

210
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,584
because it didn't take too well to others.

211
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:46,184
What? He changed it?

212
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:49,384
Yes. The key holder that he distributed today

213
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:51,584
should've been one of a beckoning cat.

214
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,584
Is something wrong with the shop owner, officer?

215
00:11:54,585 --> 00:11:56,584
No, not really.

216
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:58,784
Don't get so angry, Ran.

217
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,684
We can't go home for a while longer.

218
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:01,984
Gosh.

219
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:04,984
You were pretty knowledgeable about the story "Three Kingdoms", right?

220
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:06,484
What? Yes.

221
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:09,184
The military commander who was mounted on the Red Rabbit Horse

222
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:11,084
was called Lu Bu, right?

223
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:14,184
Right. But later, the horse was given to Cao Cao

224
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:16,684
and in the end, it went to Guan Yu, who was the last to own it.

225
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:17,784
Are you sure about it?

226
00:12:17,785 --> 00:12:20,284
Yes, because the key holder I was given of Guan Yu today

227
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:22,684
-is also riding a Red Rabbit Horse! -What?

228
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:26,684
Somebody gave you a key holder of Guan Yu riding the Red Rabbit Horse?

229
00:12:26,685 --> 00:12:27,984
Yes.

230
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:31,784
Hey, Pops! What's the address of your detective agency?

231
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:34,084
I'm asking you what's the address? What chome is it on?

232
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:35,785
Fifth chome.

233
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:39,484
Okay, I got it.

234
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:40,984
What did Pops say?

235
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:42,484
I'm not sure,

236
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:45,284
but he said he's on his way home now, and told us to not go outside.

237
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:46,984
Great.

238
00:12:46,985 --> 00:12:49,684
I've been hearing strange noises from the front door from a while ago,

239
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,285
and it's giving me the creeps.

240
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:05,192
What? Genda lives in Rizencho?

241
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:07,892
Yeah. What about it?

242
00:13:07,893 --> 00:13:11,192
When Ryoko's husband came back home at about 7:20 pm,

243
00:13:11,193 --> 00:13:15,192
we saw Mr. Genda near the house in Haidocho.

244
00:13:15,193 --> 00:13:17,292
The bus that Ran rode is probably the one

245
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:22,292
that goes from Haidocho via Beikacho and then to Rizencho.

246
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:25,792
Although it's true that Mr. Genda intended to go home once,

247
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:28,992
for one reason or another, he returned to that house.

248
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:29,993
Come to think of it,

249
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:33,192
Rizencho is the place where the first fire occurred, right?

250
00:13:33,193 --> 00:13:36,992
Yeah. The house that burned was right near his home.

251
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:38,692
The inhabitant seems to have been a good friend of his parents,

252
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,492
as well as a good customer of his shop.

253
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:44,392
Which means that the real reason he set fire to the house

254
00:13:44,393 --> 00:13:46,592
was to hide the fact that the item that he sold was fake,

255
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:49,992
and before anyone found out, he burned the house down.

256
00:13:49,993 --> 00:13:51,792
Yeah.

257
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:53,392
But I don't understand.

258
00:13:53,393 --> 00:13:54,892
Why didn't you detain him at the station

259
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:56,693
being as suspicious as he was?

260
00:13:58,593 --> 00:14:01,192
I guess the intuition of a police detective within me

261
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:03,793
has gotten rusty.

262
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:09,493
The police car has arrived in front of the detective agency.

263
00:14:12,593 --> 00:14:14,693
Hey, don't tell me that...

264
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:20,893
Genda?

265
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:25,492
-Heiji. -What is it? What happened?

266
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:29,192
After the phone call just a while ago, that man came here,

267
00:14:29,193 --> 00:14:32,092
and asked to have the key holder that he gave us in the bus back.

268
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:34,492
We asked him why, and he said...

269
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:36,392
There's going to be a fire.

270
00:14:36,393 --> 00:14:39,592
I'm going to set fire again!

271
00:14:39,593 --> 00:14:41,593
Then, he broke down in tears.

272
00:14:42,993 --> 00:14:45,693
Having no choice, I called the police, but...

273
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:49,992
Hey, Genda. Is it true?

274
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:51,793
Did you really do it?

275
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,693
I'm sorry!

276
00:14:59,593 --> 00:15:01,292
Inspector Yuminaga!

277
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:04,192
We'll take the suspect over to the Beika Police Department for now.

278
00:15:04,193 --> 00:15:06,093
Yeah.

279
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:11,692
Judging from the looks of it,

280
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:13,993
it seems he'll spit it out right away.

281
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:16,492
Hey, Hattori.

282
00:15:16,493 --> 00:15:17,992
Doesn't this seem familiar?

283
00:15:17,993 --> 00:15:21,592
Yeah. I was just thinking the same thing.

284
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:25,593
The renown Detective Poirot series, a masterpiece of all masterpieces.

285
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:29,192
It's just like "The ABC Murders".

286
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:30,692
The killer kills people who have the same initials

287
00:15:30,693 --> 00:15:32,592
as the name of the place

288
00:15:32,593 --> 00:15:35,392
and kills them off one by one in order of ABC.

289
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:39,392
Then, an ABC time schedule is placed near the corpse

290
00:15:39,393 --> 00:15:42,892
to make it look as if it were the doings of a serial killer.

291
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:48,692
And finally, he kills the actual target "C" that he is after.

292
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:51,992
He hides the orderliness of a planned murder

293
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,892
under the guise of a disorderly random murder.

294
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:56,592
It sure is similar!

295
00:15:56,593 --> 00:15:59,792
Moreover, that timid man, the arsonist,

296
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,392
who was taken away by the police just a while ago.

297
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:05,592
In that novel, he is arrested once because the real arsonist

298
00:16:05,593 --> 00:16:08,792
puts him under the illusion that he is the one committing the crime.

299
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:10,592
Genda sure resembles that character.

300
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:14,392
It seems that we'd better look into this a little deeper.

301
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:17,392
Yeah. We'd better check out the sites of the fire of 4-chome

302
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,293
that smells of tricks involved.

303
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:22,592
What? You're going to Haidocho 4-chome

304
00:16:22,593 --> 00:16:25,192
where the fire occurred last night?

305
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,193
You mean now?

306
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,392
Yeah. There's something bothering me.

307
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:31,592
I'm thinking of taking him along, too.

308
00:16:31,593 --> 00:16:33,392
Never mind the fire!

309
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:36,892
We're all scheduled to go to Tropical Land today, aren't we?

310
00:16:36,893 --> 00:16:39,292
I don't know if it's topical or pickles,

311
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:40,892
but this case is sure going to put us in a pickle

312
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:42,092
if we don't solve it fast.

313
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:43,492
Case?

314
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:46,592
But the arsonist was arrested last night, wasn't he?

315
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:49,492
Yeah! The man with the round rimmed glasses

316
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:52,392
that gave us the key holder of the red horse.

317
00:16:52,393 --> 00:16:58,892
No. Maybe that man is being mind controlled.

318
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,192
Mind controlled?

319
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:03,192
Think about it.

320
00:17:03,193 --> 00:17:06,192
Mr. Akira Morozumi is a psychiatrist.

321
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:09,092
Mr. Misao Soga is a Sensei of Feng Shui.

322
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:12,592
And Keiko Gondo is a fortune-teller.

323
00:17:12,593 --> 00:17:15,492
All three of them seem to be able to manipulate the hearts of people,

324
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,692
and have the motive to cause the fire.

325
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:19,392
Don't you think something smells?

326
00:17:19,393 --> 00:17:22,992
But those three have alibis.

327
00:17:22,993 --> 00:17:26,192
Right, so let's go and check it out again.

328
00:17:26,193 --> 00:17:31,193
Maybe a super delicious story is hidden behind all this, right?

329
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,692
It's kind of eerie.

330
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:37,392
Really, I can't understand the feeling of somebody

331
00:17:37,393 --> 00:17:38,692
who wants to come to a scary place like this.

332
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:40,392
Don't come then!

333
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,792
I can't help it!

334
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:43,292
I want the case to be solved as soon as possible,

335
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:45,992
and go to Tropical Land.

336
00:17:45,993 --> 00:17:48,692
We were a bit concerned about the case, too.

337
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:49,992
Hey, hey.

338
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:51,792
You've got a huge family accompanying you today, don't you?

339
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:53,492
Hello.

340
00:17:53,493 --> 00:17:56,692
And, did Genda confess?

341
00:17:56,693 --> 00:17:59,992
His answer is an unchanging, "I don't know".

342
00:17:59,993 --> 00:18:01,892
"I don't know"?

343
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:03,992
Yeah. According to him,

344
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:06,992
he says there's another him within himself,

345
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:10,593
and that guy may be going around setting fire.

346
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:15,092
He seems to have had the habit of sleepwalking since he was a child.

347
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,592
And that habit seems to have reoccurred recently,

348
00:18:17,593 --> 00:18:20,092
so he's been seeing a doctor for treatment.

349
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:22,292
And don't tell me his doctor is...

350
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:25,692
Yeah, Akira Morozumi.

351
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:29,892
He seems to have prescribed a tranquilizer and gave it to Genda.

352
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:31,192
But he looked really surprised

353
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,392
at hearing that Genda was the arsonist.

354
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:38,492
Come to think of it, the man called Soga also looked surprised.

355
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,592
Soga and Genda used to see each other a lot

356
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:42,792
at the antique marketplace.

357
00:18:42,793 --> 00:18:44,392
And Soga seems to be the one

358
00:18:44,393 --> 00:18:46,492
who recommended Genda to go to Morozumi's hospital.

359
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,792
Misao Soga is an odd character who quit the medical university part way

360
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:51,892
and got absorbed in Feng Shui.

361
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:55,192
The reason why Genda was in that area that day

362
00:18:55,193 --> 00:18:57,292
was because Soga had told him that if he goes to the houses there,

363
00:18:57,293 --> 00:19:01,692
the direction is good, so he might find some luck.

364
00:19:01,693 --> 00:19:04,792
Then, just as Heiji had said,

365
00:19:04,793 --> 00:19:07,592
he had some connection with Mr. Genda.

366
00:19:07,593 --> 00:19:10,392
Which means that Genda may have some connection

367
00:19:10,393 --> 00:19:13,092
with the fortune-teller Keiko Gondo, too?

368
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:16,092
No, I haven't gone that far yet,

369
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:18,592
but that lady smells fishy.

370
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:20,292
When Ryoko was found,

371
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:23,192
I saw her gripping this small cushion really hard.

372
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:26,792
I had them all come this morning to headquarters

373
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:29,392
and asked them if this looked familiar to them,

374
00:19:29,393 --> 00:19:31,792
but only that woman Gondo turned pale

375
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:34,493
and left in the wink of an eye.

376
00:19:35,193 --> 00:19:37,792
Isn't that a dying message?

377
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:40,092
Why did you let her go?

378
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:41,692
The arsonist had already confessed,

379
00:19:41,693 --> 00:19:43,592
and that lady already had an alibi

380
00:19:43,593 --> 00:19:46,592
so we couldn't detain her.

381
00:19:46,593 --> 00:19:48,792
Well, that's only if the time of the arson

382
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:50,892
is correct as you both insist.

383
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:52,892
Well, would you like to confirm for yourself?

384
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:56,093
The one who testified is the boy next door.

385
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:00,792
Really! It's really true!

386
00:20:00,793 --> 00:20:02,392
I saw it!

387
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:04,992
When the opening song of Kamen Yaiba started,

388
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:09,192
I saw a large shadow of a horse on the curtain of the living room!

389
00:20:09,193 --> 00:20:11,092
Is it true, madam?

390
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:12,093
I wonder...

391
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:15,092
because I entered the living room at 7:30 pm

392
00:20:15,093 --> 00:20:17,092
and turned on the lights right away,

393
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:18,692
so I'm not sure if there was a shadow there or not.

394
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:20,592
I'm not lying!

395
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:22,993
Will you show us that room?

396
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:26,493
It's this room.

397
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,492
If so...

398
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:32,793
the shadow of the horse was projected on this curtain.

399
00:20:37,093 --> 00:20:38,592
True.

400
00:20:38,593 --> 00:20:42,592
But, why was your son watching TV in a dark room?

401
00:20:42,593 --> 00:20:45,892
It seems all the kids in this neighborhood do so now.

402
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:48,493
It's like watching a movie and really cool!

403
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:50,892
But sonny,

404
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:52,992
make sure you turn on the lights when you watch TV, okay?

405
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:55,292
Otherwise, our eyes will go bad really quickly.

406
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:56,893
Just like him?

407
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:01,592
Maybe the shadow of the horse

408
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,692
was already projected before 7:30 pm.

409
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:09,492
The shadow that is created by flames get light and dark

410
00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:10,592
and sways a lot too,

411
00:21:10,593 --> 00:21:14,092
so you can't tell if it's a horse or not at times.

412
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:16,192
That's not true!

413
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:18,592
Because I was watching baseball all the while

414
00:21:18,593 --> 00:21:22,392
until the clock on top of the TV struck the time for Kamen Yaiba, but...

415
00:21:22,393 --> 00:21:24,692
It got really bright outside the window,

416
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:26,192
and I saw the shadow.

417
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:28,293
It was time for the Kamen Yaiba song.

418
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:32,292
Then, were you watching the baseball game with the room dark, too?

419
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:33,293
Yes.

420
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:36,792
But if it's dark, you can't see the time of the clock, right?

421
00:21:36,793 --> 00:21:38,192
I could see it

422
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:40,793
because it was dimly light outside the window.

423
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:45,693
Besides, the shadow of the horse wasn't swaying.

424
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:50,792
Hey, Heiji!

425
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:52,392
Conan!

426
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:54,392
Look really closely for it, Hattori.

427
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:55,992
I'm sure it's somewhere.

428
00:21:55,993 --> 00:21:58,692
Yeah. The evidence that will prove our deduction

429
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:00,293
is here some place for sure.

430
00:22:01,393 --> 00:22:02,592
I found it!

431
00:22:02,593 --> 00:22:04,692
It's an incandescent electric light bulb.

432
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:06,492
I've found one here, too.

433
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:07,992
Here and there in burnt places,

434
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,092
there are burnt remains of tissue paper.

435
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:11,692
Which means that...

436
00:22:11,693 --> 00:22:14,392
Yeah. If this trick is used,

437
00:22:14,393 --> 00:22:17,293
you don't have to be here to set fire to the place.

438
00:22:18,693 --> 00:22:20,092
All we need to find out now is

439
00:22:20,093 --> 00:22:23,092
how the culprit manipulated Mr. Genda.

440
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,793
We've got to find proof of that.

441
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:05,792
"Next Episode" -These are Mr. Genda's shoe marks.

442
00:24:05,793 --> 00:24:08,992
It's the same as the shoes that's in the shoes cabinet.

443
00:24:08,993 --> 00:24:11,593
There's something strange in the wastebasket.

444
00:24:12,893 --> 00:24:16,593
A soiled pair of socks and a burnt shirt.

445
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:18,892
No.

446
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:20,892
It's not a wiretap.

447
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:24,093
But we found something unbelievable.

448
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:32,493
Next Conan, "Red Horse In The Fire (Case Solved)"
