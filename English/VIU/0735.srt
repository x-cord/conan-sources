1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,617
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:01,617 --> 00:00:03,517
Ya, watermelon, right?

3
00:00:03,517 --> 00:00:04,817
I didn't forget.

4
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:06,817
Buy one that looks delicious!

5
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:09,517
I know. Geez.

6
00:00:09,517 --> 00:00:12,617
Ran, I'm going over to Dr. Agasa's...

7
00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:16,217
In other word, you, Kaori Kitasaka,

8
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:19,217
you're former member of the Johnan University Deduction Research Club

9
00:00:19,217 --> 00:00:20,917
and another former member

10
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:22,917
"Kaori Kitasaka (27)" -is having a wedding party

11
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:25,817
at 4pm today,

12
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,617
but you don't know where it's being held.

13
00:00:28,617 --> 00:00:31,317
That is because the host of the party

14
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:33,817
in keeping with the name "Deduction Research Club"

15
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:37,617
sent you an invitation written in picture puzzle.

16
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:39,017
Am I right?

17
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:42,617
Yes, I couldn't solve that picture puzzle no matter how hard I try.

18
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:45,517
And I just happened to pass by here and thought

19
00:00:45,517 --> 00:00:47,617
if it's you, the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri,

20
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:49,017
it may be an easy task.

21
00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:52,517
Okay, I understand now! You can count on me!

22
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:54,517
I, the great Detective Kogoro Mouri,

23
00:00:54,517 --> 00:00:58,517
shall solve the picture puzzle for you in no time at all!

24
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,917
Hey... are you sure about that?

25
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:03,317
So where is that puzzle picture?

26
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:05,417
Yes...

27
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:07,417
Here it is.

28
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:15,217
This is...

29
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:18,817
I see. This isn't easy to solve.

30
00:01:35,117 --> 00:01:36,817
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

31
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:38,617
are slashed by the light of deduction.

32
00:01:38,617 --> 00:01:40,317
The stage is set around the vicinity of the Bell Tree Tower.

33
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:42,317
Solve the mystery of the hall with issues.

34
00:01:42,317 --> 00:01:44,017
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:46,017
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:46,017 --> 00:01:48,817
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:23,499
"A Coded Invitation"

38
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:27,499
I was never good at deductions or codes.

39
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:31,899
The only puzzle I could solve was Tanuki Code.

40
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:33,799
Tanuki Code?

41
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,099
It is a beginner's code where a specified letter

42
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:37,699
is omitted from words to make a sentence.

43
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:43,499
-I see. -But why did you join the deduction research club?

44
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:44,999
That is because...

45
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:46,799
I got it!

46
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,499
The little finger to the index finger stand for trains!

47
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:54,299
What? Did you say trains?

48
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,799
What?

49
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,799
Trains have their line colour on them, you see?

50
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,599
This yellow little finger stands for the Sobu Line.

51
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,799
The yellow-green ring finger stands for the Yamanote Line.

52
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,299
The light blue middle finger stands for the Keihin Tohoku Line.

53
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,999
And the red index finger stands for the Chuo Line!

54
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:16,199
Which means the four train lines run parallel

55
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,099
and the place where the nail of the thumb is,

56
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:21,099
is where the party is going to be held.

57
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,699
I see! It didn't even cross my mind!

58
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,799
But I wonder if there is such a place?

59
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:30,099
Unfortunately, no.

60
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:33,099
But if you rack your brains a bit...

61
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,799
the numbers written on this invitation

62
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:40,799
tell you to look at a 1/25,000-scale map,

63
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:45,099
and place the little finger of the Sobu Line on Akihabara,

64
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:46,999
then place the ring finger of the Yamanote Line

65
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:49,399
and the middle finger of the Keihin Tohoku Line

66
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:52,799
on this line between Akihabara and Kanda,

67
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,999
and place the Chuo Line of this index finger

68
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:58,399
on the line between Ochanomizu and Kanda.

69
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,899
By doing so, the place that the nail of the thumb indicates is...

70
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:05,399
Kanda Ogawamachi!

71
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:08,099
Kanda Ogawamachi?

72
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,999
Then, the picture of the river refers to Ogawa?

73
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:17,199
But the finger on the guide map is pointing straight

74
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,999
and your hand is curved.

75
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,799
Stop getting hung up on small details!

76
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,999
Hey...

77
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:31,199
How about it? Does this location mean anything to you?

78
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,799
It does!

79
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,799
The Johnan University Hall is in second district of Kanda Ogawamachi!

80
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,099
Really?

81
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:39,099
I knew it!

82
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:42,499
The party must be being held at that hall!

83
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:44,499
You're amazing, dad!

84
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:47,799
You gotta be kidding me.

85
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:49,499
Thank you very much!

86
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,699
Now I can attend the party!

87
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,299
How much do I need to pay you?

88
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:57,399
No... I can't possibly take money from you for such an easy task.

89
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,799
What? But...

90
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:02,299
You don't have to pay me.

91
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:06,299
I'm sorry. Thank you for your kindness.

92
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:10,299
Thank you very much.

93
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:12,899
Please stop by anytime again if something comes up!

94
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:15,299
Yes, I will. Goodbye!

95
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:27,499
Since we're making it together, let's make something big!

96
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:30,099
How about creating an insect forest

97
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:32,599
by making a lot of paper insects?

98
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:35,499
How about an aquarium where a lot of fish are swimming?

99
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:38,499
An airport could be fun too!

100
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,799
So, you're not convinced of Kogoro's deduction after all, right?

101
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:46,799
Well, to put it accurately,

102
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:50,799
the train line color of the Chuo Line isn't red but vermillion.

103
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:54,799
And as for the other colors, red, blue, yellow and green,

104
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:57,799
I tried replacing all of them with corresponding colors

105
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:00,699
but nothing fits in.

106
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,699
What about the subways?

107
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,799
I thought about that too,

108
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,399
but there are no yellow train lines to begin with.

109
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,699
Bridge?

110
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,999
I see!

111
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:18,099
That is what that left hand meant.

112
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:21,099
Oh, no! I've got to let her know right away!

113
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:23,299
Sorry, I'm leaving the rest up to you!

114
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:25,299
-Conan? -Conan!

115
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:27,499
It seems that he has solved the problem.

116
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:29,799
I guess so.

117
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:32,399
"Mouri Detective Agency" -What?

118
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,399
It's not Kanda Ogawamachi?

119
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,099
Yes! Look at this map.

120
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:40,699
The river that was drawn on that picture puzzle is Sumida River.

121
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:42,699
The colors of the bridges over that river

122
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:45,499
"Kuramai Bridge" -are yellow for Kuramai Bridge,

123
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:48,799
"Umaya Bridge" -yellowish green for Umaya Bridge,

124
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:52,099
"Komagata Bridge" -blue for Komagata Bridge

125
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:55,099
"Azuma Bridge" -and red for Azuma Bridge.

126
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,199
In other words, the color of the nails

127
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,999
indicated the four bridges.

128
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,699
That's amazing, Conan.

129
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,099
You have a copy of the picture puzzle, don't you?

130
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,099
What? Yes.

131
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,399
If you place the nails of the hand of the guide map

132
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,399
onto the corresponding bridges,

133
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,399
the location of the thumb points to...

134
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,099
The Bell Tree Tower?

135
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,299
Then, is this where the party is going to be held?

136
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:23,399
But, the hall of the university is in Kanda Ogawamachi.

137
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,599
No mistake about it!

138
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,899
I confirmed by calling the Bell Tree Tower a while ago.

139
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,699
-What? -I was told that the Johnan University Deduction Research Club

140
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:34,499
is reserving a restaurant that hasn't opened yet

141
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:36,999
and is holding a wedding party there at 4pm today.

142
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:40,699
Dad, you've got to call Kaori right away and let her know!

143
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:42,099
I know.

144
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:46,299
The number you have called is not in service at this time.

145
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:49,799
-The number... -This is strange, the number is wrong.

146
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,099
-What? -You've got to call her cell phone,

147
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,699
not her home phone.

148
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,499
I'm sure Kaori is still out somewhere.

149
00:08:56,499 --> 00:08:57,799
Oh, I guess so.

150
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,299
Wait a second.

151
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:00,799
I wonder why

152
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,999
Kaori give you a wrong number for her home phone.

153
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,099
She probably just made a mistake.

154
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:08,799
But it's her home phone.

155
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,399
Would anyone make such a mistake?

156
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,499
Then she wrote down a wrong number on purpose.

157
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,299
There are people like that at times.

158
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:19,099
They leave false information because they don't want their family

159
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:21,299
to find out they visited a detective agency.

160
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,799
But Kaori just wanted to know

161
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,799
where the wedding party was going to be held, right?

162
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,799
That is not something that she wouldn't want her family to know, is it?

163
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,499
How would I know? Cut out your nonsense!

164
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:35,199
Yes?

165
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,499
Hello, is this Kaori?

166
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:40,599
Mouri here. The fact is...

167
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:44,999
I see! I'm at the university hall in Ogawamachi right now.

168
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:48,099
And I was getting worried because the party wasn't taking place here.

169
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:49,999
So it's the Bell Tree Tower?

170
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:51,599
Thank you very much.

171
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:54,999
No problem. Take care.

172
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:58,499
I'm glad that she'll probably make it in time for the party.

173
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:03,299
I wonder why Kaori give us her real cell phone number,

174
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:06,999
but lied about her home phone.

175
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:12,099
Although she said she just happened to pass by,

176
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:15,499
I wonder if anyone would visit a detective agency just like that.

177
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:19,799
Did you ask anything about Kaori's family?

178
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:22,999
Yes, it seems that Kaori is single

179
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:25,199
and living with her parents.

180
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:27,799
Was there anything strange about her

181
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,099
when she was writing down her home phone number?

182
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:32,399
What? No!

183
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,199
What a nuisance!

184
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:40,199
Come to think of it, after she wrote down her cell phone...

185
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:44,199
Should I write down my home phone number too?

186
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:47,199
Yes, if it's okay with you.

187
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:59,799
Maybe she only lied about the last digit.

188
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,399
Yes, this is the Kitasaka residence.

189
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,399
Oh, no! I was so desperate looking for her phone number

190
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,799
that I haven't think of anything to say!

191
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,799
Hello?

192
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:19,299
Well... I'm Conan Edogawa.

193
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,099
Conan Edogawa?

194
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:23,099
What? Conan?

195
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,999
-Excuse me, may I... -Oh, sure.

196
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:27,799
Hello, Conan? This is Officer Sato from the Metropolitan Police Department.

197
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,799
Officer Sato?

198
00:11:31,052 --> 00:11:35,352
I'm at Mr. Kitasaka's house with Officer Takagi now.

199
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:38,152
Why are you calling this house, Conan?

200
00:11:38,152 --> 00:11:41,052
Why are you there, Officer Sato?

201
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:42,752
Did an incident come up?

202
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:45,052
What? Well...

203
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:48,752
I'll put Pops on the line now.

204
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:51,752
This is Mouri, did something come up at the Kitasaka residence?

205
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,052
Mr. Mouri?

206
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:56,452
What happened? Maybe I can help.

207
00:11:57,752 --> 00:12:00,452
The fact is a pistol was lost.

208
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:02,452
What? A pistol?

209
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:07,452
Yes. The lost pistol was an Imperial Japanese Army-issue Type

210
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:09,852
14 Nambu semi-automatic pistol.

211
00:12:09,852 --> 00:12:13,752
The pistol seems to have been found

212
00:12:13,752 --> 00:12:16,452
when Mr. Michio Kitasawa sorting through the belongings

213
00:12:16,452 --> 00:12:20,452
of his late father, Nobuyoshi, who passed away last year.

214
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,752
Of course, military pistols

215
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:26,452
are supposed to be reported to the police as soon as it has found

216
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:31,152
but it seems that Mr. Michio kept it along with 5 bullets

217
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:33,352
as a precious keepsake of his father.

218
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,852
I see.

219
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:37,252
So, that pistol was lost.

220
00:12:37,252 --> 00:12:38,352
Yes.

221
00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:41,352
It doesn't look like anyone broke in to steal it.

222
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:43,052
If it is taken out of the house,

223
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:46,952
the only one who can think of doing this is their daughter, Kaori.

224
00:12:46,952 --> 00:12:52,752
Kaori left this morning after saying that she was going to attend

225
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:55,352
a wedding party of her senior,

226
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:57,652
but she didn't look quite herself then.

227
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,752
They say that she looked depressed.

228
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:03,052
-What? -From what we've heard from her parents,

229
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:07,752
it seems that the senior was two-timing Kaori

230
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:10,352
and the other girl, who is his fiance,

231
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:13,352
and eventually dumped Kaori.

232
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:15,352
Hey, then...

233
00:13:15,352 --> 00:13:18,952
Yes. Mr. Michio realised that the pistol was gone,

234
00:13:18,952 --> 00:13:22,452
and tried several times to call Kaori but couldn't establish a connection.

235
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:25,752
That is why they contacted the police.

236
00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:28,952
We were thinking of checking

237
00:13:28,952 --> 00:13:30,752
where the wedding party was going to be held.

238
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:32,952
I know where the party is going to be held!

239
00:13:32,952 --> 00:13:34,952
-It's at the Bell Tree Tower! -What?

240
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:42,152
But is Kaori really the one who took the pistol?

241
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:43,752
When she came to the agency,

242
00:13:43,752 --> 00:13:46,652
Kaori was holding a large clutch bag, wasn't she?

243
00:13:46,652 --> 00:13:48,152
What? Yes.

244
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:52,852
When she was getting ready to leave,

245
00:13:52,852 --> 00:13:56,752
she probably had the pistol in that bag.

246
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,452
-What? -Besides,

247
00:13:58,452 --> 00:14:02,652
did you notice that Kaori was wearing low-heeled shoes?

248
00:14:05,652 --> 00:14:08,652
Yes. I was thinking that it would be better

249
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:11,452
if she wear higher heels since she was going to a party.

250
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:14,152
She was probably wearing low-heeled shoes...

251
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:17,452
To stabilise herself

252
00:14:17,452 --> 00:14:20,752
so that she wouldn't miss the target when she fires the pistol.

253
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:24,452
What? Then she really did...

254
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:27,152
Kaori was bad at deductions or codes,

255
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:30,152
she joined the Deduction Research Club

256
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:33,652
might be because she loves the senior.

257
00:14:33,652 --> 00:14:37,452
This is bad! We won't make it in time.

258
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:41,152
How? What can I do?

259
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,452
Conan?

260
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:53,652
I hope this can somehow make her have second thoughts!

261
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:10,852
"Reserved"

262
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:27,052
Thank you all for coming here today

263
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,752
to celebrate this happy occasion!

264
00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:32,152
Did you all figure out this party hall right away?

265
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:33,952
Well, how could we?

266
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,052
Yonekura is not even here yet!

267
00:16:36,052 --> 00:16:38,952
Yes... we'll hear you all out later.

268
00:16:38,952 --> 00:16:42,452
Let's call the bride and groom over now!

269
00:16:49,452 --> 00:16:51,652
Congrats...

270
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:54,652
First, we'd like to start with a speech

271
00:16:54,652 --> 00:16:56,152
from our groom who is filled with happiness.

272
00:16:56,152 --> 00:16:59,152
I wonder if Kaori is still not here.

273
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,752
No, if she came here from Kanda Ogawamachi,

274
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:03,752
she should've been here long before.

275
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:08,752
Kaori...

276
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:10,452
Dad!

277
00:17:22,452 --> 00:17:24,452
Kaori!

278
00:17:37,852 --> 00:17:39,152
Don't do it!

279
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:44,052
Don't do it, Kaori!

280
00:17:51,052 --> 00:17:52,952
What did you say when you proposed?

281
00:17:52,952 --> 00:17:56,752
Well, you really want me to say that?

282
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:06,452
Kaori?

283
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,052
Kaori.

284
00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:19,852
Kaori!

285
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:26,152
Congratulations, Mr. Nagai.

286
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:29,952
Thank you, Kaori.

287
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:50,752
I'm glad you didn't go through with it.

288
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:52,352
Little boy.

289
00:18:52,352 --> 00:18:56,752
Pops went down stairs together with the other officers.

290
00:18:56,752 --> 00:19:00,452
It seems like he mistook someone else for you.

291
00:19:07,152 --> 00:19:08,952
A while ago,

292
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:12,052
when I was trying to head to the party hall...

293
00:19:18,052 --> 00:19:19,352
"You have a message"

294
00:19:27,052 --> 00:19:31,352
"To Kaori"

295
00:19:31,352 --> 00:19:35,152
At first, I didn't know what was written,

296
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:40,052
but when I read the mail ignoring the characters "ke" and "i",

297
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:44,452
it was interpreted as, "I'm glad that you got to split with him."

298
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:49,252
At that time,

299
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:54,152
all the feelings I had vanished like an ebb tide.

300
00:19:55,152 --> 00:20:01,152
I was sure that you'd be able to decode the Tanuki Code.

301
00:20:01,152 --> 00:20:06,152
What? Then, this message didn't come from Mr. Mouri?

302
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:08,852
Conan!

303
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:10,852
Kaori!

304
00:20:12,052 --> 00:20:17,652
Kaori, you said that you just happened to pass by the agency

305
00:20:17,652 --> 00:20:22,352
but I'll bet you came to the agency on purpose

306
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:26,452
because you wanted Pops to solve the problem, right?

307
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:31,052
Yes, I used the great Detective Mouri.

308
00:20:32,952 --> 00:20:34,652
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:38,752
No... don't worry about it.

310
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:40,452
Ms. Kaori Kitasaka.

311
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:42,152
Yes.

312
00:20:42,152 --> 00:20:43,752
I'm Officer Sato from the First Investigation Division

313
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:44,952
of the Metropolitan Police Department.

314
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,152
I'm Officer Takagi from the same division.

315
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:02,552
Ms. Kitasaka, please come with us.

316
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,652
Yes.

317
00:21:07,652 --> 00:21:10,752
Little boy, your name is Conan, right?

318
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:15,352
Yes, Conan Edogawa. A detective.

319
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:20,952
Thank you, little detective.

320
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:55,952
In the end, papers were filed against Kaori and her father, Mr. Michio,

321
00:22:55,952 --> 00:22:58,752
for breach of the Swords and Firearms Control Law.

322
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,752
But, all charges against them were dropped.

323
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:02,452
Thus, the tragic pistol incident that never came to be

324
00:23:02,452 --> 00:23:05,152
was safely solved.

325
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:06,152
Come to think of it,

326
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:09,752
Sonoko invited us to visit the Tohto Bell Tree Tower tomorrow.

327
00:23:09,752 --> 00:23:11,352
This is something to looking forward to it, isn't it?

328
00:23:11,352 --> 00:23:12,752
I'm looking forward to it!

329
00:23:12,752 --> 00:23:14,352
I hope the weather is good.

330
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:18,052
I'll make a "keep away the rain" charm.

331
00:23:18,052 --> 00:23:20,652
I have to accompany them again.

332
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:25,752
There are a lot of tasty restaurants

333
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:29,152
-near the Bell Tree Tower, aren't there? -We had no idea at that time,

334
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:34,952
-Let's have eels over rice for lunch. -there is another sniper case

335
00:23:34,952 --> 00:23:38,652
was waiting for us at the Bell Tree Tower.

336
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:41,952
"Next Episode"

337
00:23:41,952 --> 00:23:44,052
Just as expected of a great detective,

338
00:23:44,052 --> 00:23:47,452
figuring out the hide-out of Thief K!

339
00:23:47,452 --> 00:23:51,052
So, you've finally appeared, Thief K!

340
00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:03,052
Gosh. Where on earth is he?

341
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:04,452
Next Conan,

342
00:24:04,452 --> 00:24:07,152
"The Secret of the Kogoro Mouri Statue"

343
00:24:24,352 --> 00:24:26,752
Next Conan's Hint:

344
00:24:26,752 --> 00:24:28,852
"Basketball"

345
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:30,152
The movie will be released from today.

346
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:31,452
The theme song is great!

347
00:24:31,452 --> 00:24:33,152
I love the singer too!
