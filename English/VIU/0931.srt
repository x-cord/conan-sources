1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,300
We accompanied Pops to Kokura, Fukuoka,

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,800
for the Japanese Detective League's award ceremony

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,800
so he could accept his Best Detective Award.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,500
"Kokura Station"

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,000
We've arrived in Kokura.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,200
"Kokura Station" -The award ceremony starts at 7 pm,

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,000
so we have plenty of time.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I know. I should give him a call.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,400
Conan, let's visit Munakata first.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,100
Munakata?

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,200
I've always wanted to visit

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Munakata Taisha and Miyajidake Shrine.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,300
He's not answering.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,400
And...

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,300
-Who are you calling? -This camphor tree is huge.

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,200
-My senior from the MPD -That might be a good place

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,700
-runs a company in Kokura. -to shop for souvenirs for Mom.

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,400
Your senior from the MPD?

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Torazo Fukamachi.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,100
They called him the Tiger of Sakuradamon.

21
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,300
The Tiger of Sakuradamon?

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,400
-He's not answering. -I need to buy souvenirs for Mom,

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
-Okay! -Sonoko, and Sera.

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,500
-Let's head over to his office -What would

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,000
-and surprise him. -Shinichi...

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,200
What?

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,600
Hold on! You promised we'd go sightseeing this afternoon!

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,700
We came all the way to Kokura.

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,400
We can afford to stop by for a while.

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,100
Then you should go by yourself.

31
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,800
But...

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,200
I'd like to meet the Tiger of Sakuradamon too.

33
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,200
But, Conan...

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,700
And I'd be worried about leaving him alone.

35
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,900
Let's meet back here around lunch.

36
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,900
Okay!

37
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,600
But I wanted to go sightseeing together.

38
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,200
In my eyes are maximum creation.

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,900
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

40
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,600
Pops been given a detective award?

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,500
Something's happening in Northern Kyushu!

42
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,900
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,600
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,000
His name is Detective Conan!

45
00:03:51,742 --> 00:03:57,542
"The Northern Kyushu Mystery Tour (Kokura Arc)"

46
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:01,942
"Wakato Bridge"

47
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:10,242
"Old Furukawa Mining Wakamatsu Building"

48
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:24,042
"Tiger Tradings"

49
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:27,842
He was hospitalized for an injury?

50
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:28,842
Yes.

51
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:32,742
"Eisaku Kiriyama (45)" -A week ago, he hit his head when he fell.

52
00:04:32,742 --> 00:04:34,642
He's still unconscious.

53
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,242
He's unconscious?

54
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,542
How did he fall?

55
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:41,542
Tell us exactly what happened.

56
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:45,142
Izumi, tell them.

57
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:46,542
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:50,042
"Noriko Izumi (28)" -The president injured his knee several years ago.

59
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:52,042
As part of his rehabilitation,

60
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,642
every morning he takes a walk around the office.

61
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:59,542
"Torazo Fukamachi (63)" -That day, he tripped on a parking block.

62
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:03,542
I found him on the ground

63
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:06,042
and called an ambulance immediately.

64
00:05:07,242 --> 00:05:09,642
Which hospital is he staying at?

65
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,442
If you're hoping to visit him, don't.

66
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:14,942
You'd be hindering his treatment.

67
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:16,242
But...

68
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:18,242
Pops, don't be unreasonable.

69
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:20,442
Shut up.

70
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:22,342
By the way, Mr. Mouri,

71
00:05:22,342 --> 00:05:25,642
I heard you're a great detective.

72
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:28,442
Well, I don't mean to brag,

73
00:05:28,442 --> 00:05:31,542
but I was chosen for the Best Detective Award.

74
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:37,042
In that case, could you catch a culprit for us?

75
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:38,342
A culprit?

76
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:43,642
You mean his injury wasn't an accident?

77
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:47,542
No, that's not what I mean.

78
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:50,642
Someone vandalized our office.

79
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,942
Vandalized?

80
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:59,642
"Tiger"

81
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:00,742
Tiger?

82
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:05,542
Who found this?

83
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:06,842
I did.

84
00:06:07,942 --> 00:06:09,242
Who are you?

85
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:11,242
I'm the president's driver.

86
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:12,842
"Makoto Ukaji (42)" -My name is Ukaji.

87
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:14,342
"Makoto Ukaji (42)" -Three days ago,

88
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:18,442
this was here when I arrived for work in the morning.

89
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:20,342
This isn't the only place.

90
00:06:20,342 --> 00:06:22,642
"Tiger" -It's also on the office parking lot,

91
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:25,042
"Tiger" -the wall of the warehouse,

92
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:28,742
"Tiger" -and even on the front door of my home.

93
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:30,542
Your front door?

94
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:34,642
Yes. It's clearly meant to threaten me.

95
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:36,942
What do you mean by threaten you?

96
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:40,942
The truth is the stockholders' meeting scheduled at 3 pm today

97
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,942
will decide that if President Fukamachi is unable to return to work,

98
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:46,942
I will become the next president.

99
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:51,242
Torahiko must have heard about it.

100
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:52,742
Torahiko?

101
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:55,242
President Fukamachi's son.

102
00:06:55,242 --> 00:06:57,842
He attends a university in Tokyo

103
00:06:57,842 --> 00:07:00,142
but we haven't been able to get in touch with him

104
00:07:00,142 --> 00:07:02,842
since he heard about the accident and came home.

105
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:07,042
Torahiko was lazy and a handful.

106
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:11,342
In high school, he was suspended for writing similar graffiti.

107
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:12,742
He also caused an uproar

108
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:14,642
by using fireworks to build a bomb.

109
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,842
He's gotten in trouble with the police

110
00:07:16,842 --> 00:07:19,142
more than a couple of times.

111
00:07:20,642 --> 00:07:25,642
He probably assumed he'd take over his father's position.

112
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:27,842
So he's threatening you

113
00:07:27,842 --> 00:07:31,042
so you won't become the company president?

114
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:32,742
If we don't do something,

115
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:35,742
it's possible he'll hurt the director.

116
00:07:35,742 --> 00:07:36,742
Have you told the police?

117
00:07:36,742 --> 00:07:40,442
We did but they said the graffiti alone would only allow them

118
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:44,342
to investigate it as a case of vandalism and trespassing.

119
00:07:44,342 --> 00:07:48,642
Do you have proof that Mr. Torahiko did it?

120
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:50,942
I told you to shut up.

121
00:07:50,942 --> 00:07:52,642
There's a witness.

122
00:07:52,642 --> 00:07:54,142
A witness?

123
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:58,142
The security guard, Mr. Iwata, said that saw the culprit fleeing.

124
00:07:58,142 --> 00:08:00,842
Where is he now?

125
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:03,342
He should be at the warehouse on the opposite side of the river.

126
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:06,642
It takes five minutes by boat. I'll take you there.

127
00:08:06,642 --> 00:08:08,042
Thank you.

128
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:10,042
Mister, I want to go too.

129
00:08:11,342 --> 00:08:12,942
You'd be in the way.

130
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:15,042
Wait here.

131
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:17,342
Your necktie is crooked.

132
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:22,042
Shall we go?

133
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:25,242
-Yes. -Be careful.

134
00:08:25,242 --> 00:08:29,442
"Tiger Tradings"

135
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:38,442
"Miyajidake Shrine"

136
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:52,842
"President's Office"

137
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:53,842
What?

138
00:08:53,842 --> 00:08:55,342
He did?

139
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:58,742
Yeah. He went to gather information

140
00:08:58,742 --> 00:09:00,942
with the secretary, Ms. Izumi,

141
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:03,042
in order to find the person who graffitied the buildings.

142
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,642
Should he have accepted that job?

143
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:08,842
Where are you right now?

144
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:12,442
Miyajidake Shrine. It's famous for its path of light.

145
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:13,942
Path of light?

146
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:16,542
The shrine approach stretches straight to the ocean.

147
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:19,242
Twice a year, the sun sets right over it.

148
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:22,542
It's supposed to be breathtaking.

149
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:25,242
I went to Munakata Taisha too.

150
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:28,442
"Munakata Taisha" -It's mentioned in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki.

151
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,142
It's one of Japan's oldest shrines.

152
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:40,942
It's famous for its Miare Festival held in the fall.

153
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:44,742
The Sacred Island of Okinoshima

154
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:47,342
and Associated Sites in the Munakata Region

155
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:50,342
are inscribed on the World Heritage List.

156
00:09:50,342 --> 00:09:52,042
World Heritage List?

157
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:53,442
That's amazing.

158
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:56,842
Anyway, let's meet somewhere for lunch.

159
00:09:56,842 --> 00:09:57,942
Okay.

160
00:10:02,942 --> 00:10:06,542
So this is President Fukamachi and his son, Mr. Torahiko.

161
00:10:37,842 --> 00:10:40,642
Sonny, this is the president's office.

162
00:10:40,642 --> 00:10:42,842
You shouldn't be in here.

163
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,242
Sorry.

164
00:10:44,242 --> 00:10:49,742
And don't tell anyone I was sitting in his chair.

165
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:51,442
Where's Director Kiriyama?

166
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,742
He's visiting the president in the hospital.

167
00:10:53,742 --> 00:10:57,142
But isn't he still unconscious?

168
00:10:58,442 --> 00:11:00,842
Today is a special day.

169
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:02,542
A special day?

170
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,842
You might be too young to understand,

171
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:08,442
but in a shareholders' meeting at 3 pm today,

172
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:11,742
he will be appointed as the next president.

173
00:11:11,742 --> 00:11:13,342
So he wants to report it to the president

174
00:11:13,342 --> 00:11:16,442
even if it's only as a formality.

175
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:20,342
But he told Pops not to visit him.

176
00:11:20,342 --> 00:11:23,242
That's why I said today's a special day.

177
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:25,742
Today, the director will be taking the president's car

178
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:28,042
to the shareholders' meeting.

179
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:31,942
I haven't driven his car in a week.

180
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,842
It's a very important day for the company.

181
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:39,142
Where's the parking lot where the president tripped?

182
00:11:39,142 --> 00:11:41,142
Beneath that window.

183
00:11:42,742 --> 00:11:45,642
"Tiger Tradings"

184
00:11:45,842 --> 00:11:48,642
"Wakamatsu Ferry"

185
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,642
"Tobata to Wakamatsu"

186
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,942
Mr. Mouri.

187
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:03,942
Could we keep what I'm about to tell you between us?

188
00:12:03,942 --> 00:12:05,242
Of course.

189
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:08,842
It's a detective's job to keep secrets.

190
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:11,542
The truth is...

191
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:22,042
"Tiger"

192
00:12:25,242 --> 00:12:27,542
Bloodstains.

193
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:30,542
So this is where Mr. Fukamachi hit his head.

194
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:35,342
The blocks are approximately two meters apart.

195
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:40,442
Mr. Fukamachi looked surprisingly small in that photo.

196
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:42,442
If he just tripped on the block,

197
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:45,142
he wouldn't have hit his head here.

198
00:12:45,142 --> 00:12:47,242
It'd be impossible for him to hit his head here

199
00:12:47,242 --> 00:12:49,642
unless he was running.

200
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:52,742
But Mr. Fukamachi's knees were injured so he couldn't run.

201
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:55,542
Which means...

202
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,442
Director Kiriyama did?

203
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:58,742
Yes.

204
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:00,842
The director and president

205
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:05,842
often argued over how to manage the company.

206
00:13:05,842 --> 00:13:10,542
In other words, you believe Director Kiriyama pushed Fukamachi.

207
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:15,942
It's possible.

208
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:17,942
It's possible Torahiko

209
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:20,042
is trying to get revenge on the director

210
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:23,042
because he learned that.

211
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:26,542
Revenge?

212
00:13:31,171 --> 00:13:35,771
"Tiger Tradings"

213
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:37,471
"Genichiro Iwata (63)" -Yes, I saw someone run

214
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:40,171
three days ago in the morning.

215
00:13:40,171 --> 00:13:42,771
You're sure it was Torahiko?

216
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:46,423
When I worked as a fireworks maker,

217
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,515
Torahiko stole some gunpowder from the workshop.

218
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:54,515
It reminded me of how he looked then.

219
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:58,715
Mr. Iwata and the president are childhood friends.

220
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:02,415
It's the reason he knows Torahiko so well.

221
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:04,215
I saw him from behind,

222
00:14:04,215 --> 00:14:06,615
but he had blond hair.

223
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:08,815
I'm fairly certain it was him.

224
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:13,815
Don't you remember what you said in the ambulance?

225
00:14:13,815 --> 00:14:15,515
The ambulance?

226
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:17,215
Are we finished?

227
00:14:17,215 --> 00:14:21,615
I need to take the president's car for cleaning.

228
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:24,015
Sorry to have interrupted your busy schedule.

229
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:32,215
What did he mean about the ambulance?

230
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,415
Inside the ambulance,

231
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:47,215
"Kokura Castle" -the president was barely conscious.

232
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:48,615
Then,

233
00:14:48,615 --> 00:14:51,715
"Kokura Castle - Toraccha" -he only said the word "tora" (Tiger).

234
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:53,915
Tiger?

235
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:59,115
Apparently, the EMTs heard him say "dorako".

236
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:00,915
"Dorako"?

237
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:03,615
"Kokura Castle Gardens" -Maybe he was trying to say

238
00:15:03,615 --> 00:15:05,915
"dora musuko" (lazy son).

239
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:07,915
Whether it was tiger or lazy son,

240
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:11,915
he must have been really worried about Torahiko.

241
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:13,715
It's not like that.

242
00:15:13,715 --> 00:15:15,415
What?

243
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,215
Mr. Iwata believes Torahiko

244
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:20,315
may have pushed the president.

245
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:22,115
He what?

246
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:25,115
Mr. Iwata thinks he's threatening the director

247
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:29,715
in order to keep him quiet because he found out about it.

248
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:33,815
"Tiger"

249
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:40,315
Is Torahiko that bad of a guy?

250
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:45,815
Ms. Izumi, do you have any idea where Torahiko might be?

251
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:48,115
There's a cafe near Mojiko

252
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:52,815
called Airs Cafe where he worked part time in high school.

253
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:58,115
"Three months ago"

254
00:15:58,115 --> 00:15:59,815
"Two months ago"

255
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:01,615
"One months ago"

256
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:03,015
"Three days ago"

257
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:05,915
There he is. It's Mr. Torahiko.

258
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:07,715
Three days ago in the night?

259
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:09,615
That's after the buildings were graffitied.

260
00:16:11,115 --> 00:16:13,015
Huh?

261
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:20,515
Mister, what are you doing?

262
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:24,315
Isn't this President Fukamachi's car?

263
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:27,815
Yeah. It's my job to clean it.

264
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:29,715
That's Toraccha, right?

265
00:16:29,715 --> 00:16:32,515
Kokura Castle's mascot.

266
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:34,315
Who are you?

267
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:35,815
I'm Conan.

268
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:38,815
I came here with Pops Kogoro.

269
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:42,615
Kogoro? Do you mean Detective Kogoro Mouri?

270
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:44,515
Yeah. Do you know him?

271
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:48,415
He was just at the warehouse asking about the graffiti.

272
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:51,815
So you're the witness, Mr. Iwata.

273
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:52,915
Yeah.

274
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:03,215
Hello?

275
00:17:03,215 --> 00:17:05,915
What? In the president's office?

276
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:09,815
Understood. I'll head there immediately.

277
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:16,915
I just cleaned the car,

278
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:18,415
so don't make it dirty.

279
00:17:18,415 --> 00:17:19,415
Okay.

280
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:24,615
The president's office?

281
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:28,215
Where should we go now?

282
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:41,815
This is no fun alone.

283
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,115
Conan?

284
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:50,315
I'm at Mojiko Retro right now.

285
00:17:50,315 --> 00:17:54,715
There are lots of tasty looking shops serving baked curry.

286
00:17:54,715 --> 00:17:56,715
Conan want to come?

287
00:17:56,715 --> 00:18:00,315
I'll wait for the Pops a little longer.

288
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:04,315
What? Aren't you hungry?

289
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:06,615
No, I'm fine.

290
00:18:06,615 --> 00:18:09,815
Eat lunch without me.

291
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:11,415
Okay.

292
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:19,215
This was supposed to be a fun trip.

I'm so lonely.

296
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:44,215
Sorry, were you waiting long?

297
00:18:44,215 --> 00:18:45,315
Huh?

298
00:18:48,915 --> 00:18:51,515
Sorry but could you be my girlfriend for a while?

299
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:52,615
What?

300
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:55,815
I'm being followed by bad men.

301
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:56,915
I just need 10 seconds.

302
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:58,015
What?

303
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:06,915
Darn it!

304
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,615
Let's go!

305
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:17,415
Hey.

306
00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:22,615
Thanks. You saved me.

My dad loves tigers.

314
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:14,315
Was your dad known as the Tiger of Sakuradamon at the MPD?

315
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:16,615
What? How did you know?

316
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:20,015
My dad worked with your dad.

317

His name is Kogoro Mouri.

318

Torahiko was here three ago in night.

00:20:44,715 --> 00:20:46,015
Three days ago?

322
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:49,015
That's the night the buildings were vandalized.

Huh? Ran?

What? Torahiko?

00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:00,615
Could it be?

326
00:21:00,615 --> 00:21:01,715
What is it?

327
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:05,715
I saw Torahiko just now, but he's with...

328
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:08,115
No, that can't be.

329
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:10,015
You saw Torahiko?

330
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,315
I'm not sure it was him,

331
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:14,615
but I may or may not have seen him with a young woman

I see. Your dad's a detective.

335
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:24,015
He's been hired to investigate some vandalism case

336
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:27,515
at Mr. Fukamachi's office.

337
00:21:30,815 --> 00:21:33,115
It's my dad.

338
00:21:33,115 --> 00:21:34,915
Ran, where are you?

339
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:36,415
Where am I?

340
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:38,415
A place called Mojiko Retro.

341
00:21:38,415 --> 00:21:41,815
What? You're not with Torahiko, are you?

342
00:21:41,815 --> 00:21:43,915
What? How did you know?

343
00:21:43,915 --> 00:21:47,215
I knew it. What are you thinking?

344
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:50,015
What are you so angry about?

345
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:52,715
Torahiko is Mr. Fukamachi's son.

346
00:21:52,715 --> 00:21:54,515
I know that!

347
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:56,915
Do you have any who he is?

348
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,215
I told you, he's Fukamachi's son...

349
00:21:59,215 --> 00:22:01,415
Stop!

350
00:22:01,415 --> 00:22:02,915
Let go!

351
00:22:02,915 --> 00:22:05,015
Stop resisting!

352
00:22:05,015 --> 00:22:06,415
What are you doing?

353
00:22:07,515 --> 00:22:09,215
Stay out of the way!

354
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,515
Ran, what's wrong?

355
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:16,115
What happened?

356
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:17,215
Ran!

357
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:45,515
"Next Episode"

358
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:46,615
It's an emergency!

359
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:48,615
Something must've happened to Ran!

360
00:23:49,915 --> 00:23:52,415
Who are you?

361
00:23:52,415 --> 00:23:55,415
Did you write the graffiti, Torahiko?

362
00:23:55,415 --> 00:23:57,015
It wasn't me.

363
00:23:57,015 --> 00:23:58,615
If you're innocent,

364
00:23:58,615 --> 00:24:01,615
my father will protect you.

365
00:24:01,615 --> 00:24:03,115
Ran, listen closely.

366
00:24:03,115 --> 00:24:04,315
That Toraccha...

367
00:24:06,915 --> 00:24:08,415
Next Conan,

368
00:24:08,415 --> 00:24:12,615
