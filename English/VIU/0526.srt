1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,100
"Mouri Detective Agency."

2
00:00:03,102 --> 00:00:06,002
"A man working at a securities company is killed in his condo."

3
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:08,502
"The murder weapon is a hunting rifle."

4
00:00:08,502 --> 00:00:11,802
"The police is investigating the case as murder from a grudge."

5
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:13,502
But, how frightening,

6
00:00:13,502 --> 00:00:15,702
that condo is near here, isn't it?

7
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:18,602
The culprit could be hiding anywhere nearby...

8
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:21,102
Azusa?

9
00:00:21,102 --> 00:00:22,602
"Azusa Enomoto (23)" -I'm sorry.

10
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:26,002
I'll make a new one and bring it right away!

11
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:29,002
Are you all right? You look pale.

12
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:30,402
Really?

13
00:00:30,402 --> 00:00:31,602
Come to think of it,

14
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:34,202
"Sugihito Enomoto (28)" -your older brother

15
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:37,302
also practices shooting, doesn't he?

16
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:39,002
What does that have to do with anything?

17
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:43,302
Sugihito does sporting clays, not rifle hunting.

18
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:47,702
But it looks like there are a lot of people here with scary faces

19
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:49,702
who suspect that he's involved.

20
00:00:49,702 --> 00:00:51,402
Now that you mentioned it,

21
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:52,602
there are a lot of people

22
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:56,102
with threatening looks on their faces in this shop.

23
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:59,802
Some of the guys look sort of familiar, too.

24
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:02,002
The person sitting there at the counter

25
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:04,902
looks exactly like a man I know.

26
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,802
If I'm not mistaken, aren't you...

27
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:16,002
Officer Takagi. What're you doing?

28
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:20,002
A crisis is gracefully revived.

29
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:22,302
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

30
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:24,002
Coffee Shop Poirot is full of police officers.

31
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:26,102
The parcel that is delivered is full of mystery.

32
00:01:26,102 --> 00:01:27,602
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:27,602 --> 00:01:29,602
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:01:29,602 --> 00:01:31,702
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

35
00:03:06,243 --> 00:03:11,743
"A Delivery From The Real Culprit."

36
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:15,843
What? Sugihito is being suspected?

37
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:17,843
You mean about this securities businessman's case?

38
00:03:17,843 --> 00:03:21,043
Yes. The victim, Mr. Takafumi Torihira

39
00:03:21,043 --> 00:03:24,743
is Azusa's older brother, Sugihito's boss.

40
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:26,743
And his fingerprints were found

41
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:28,743
on the rifle left back at the scene of the crime.

42
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:32,243
Moreover, when we went to his apartment, no one was there,

43
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:34,943
and he seems to have been absent from work without contacting the company.

44
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:37,943
We're staking out here because he may just contact

45
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:39,943
his younger sister.

46
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:41,843
I see.

47
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:45,043
And? Did your brother contact you?

48
00:03:45,043 --> 00:03:46,843
I already told the officers too.

49
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:50,643
Yes, just once, telling me not to worry.

50
00:03:50,643 --> 00:03:54,443
Besides, he told me that he's innocent

51
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,043
and hasn't done anything!

52
00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:58,743
Exactly.

53
00:03:58,743 --> 00:04:00,843
I'm sure it's a mistake.

54
00:04:00,843 --> 00:04:03,343
Who are you?

55
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,143
"Touji Kawase (28)" -He's Mr. Kawase,

56
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:07,943
who works with my brother.

57
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:11,243
I came by here on business, so I stopped by.

58
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:14,643
The fingerprints that were found on the rifle,

59
00:04:14,643 --> 00:04:17,743
were they really Sugihito's prints?

60
00:04:17,743 --> 00:04:19,743
Yeah, no doubt about it.

61
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:21,743
That's probably because 4 or 5 members from our company

62
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:24,243
including him went to Mr. Torihira's condo the other day,

63
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:26,743
and were shown a rifle there.

64
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:30,443
Maybe that's why they found his fingerprints on it.

65
00:04:30,443 --> 00:04:33,343
Back then, he was touching the rifle with great interest

66
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:35,943
and even looked into the gun barrel.

67
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,343
Why with great interest?

68
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:40,943
He also does sporting clay, doesn't he?

69
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:43,643
No, shotguns are used in sporting clay.

70
00:04:43,643 --> 00:04:44,943
He was excited saying that

71
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:48,043
it was the first time he ever touched a hunting rifle.

72
00:04:48,043 --> 00:04:49,443
Excited?

73
00:04:49,443 --> 00:04:52,343
But, it doesn't seem your brother had anything against this Mr. Torihira

74
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:56,743
because he obviously went over to spend time at his house.

75
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:59,443
No, brother used to tell me

76
00:04:59,443 --> 00:05:01,943
that he was a very strict boss, but a good person.

77
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:03,543
Strict?

78
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:06,743
It seems that Mr. Torihira took special notice of Enomoto

79
00:05:06,743 --> 00:05:09,343
because he was competent.

80
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:12,143
Enomoto was frequently scolded severely by Mr. Torihira

81
00:05:12,143 --> 00:05:14,743
in front of everyone else.

82
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:17,843
Well, I guess you could call it "strictness born from love".

83
00:05:18,843 --> 00:05:21,943
If the prints just coincidentally got on the rifle,

84
00:05:21,943 --> 00:05:23,443
why did he have to flee?

85
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:25,243
Moreover, it seems that

86
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:27,643
he made it out of his apartment in an extreme rush.

87
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:28,843
An extreme rush?

88
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:31,943
Yeah. The front door was left unlocked,

89
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:35,543
and even his cash card and wallet were left behind.

90
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:39,443
And, those aren't the only things he left behind upon fleeing.

91
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:40,943
At a trash dump near his apartment,

92
00:05:40,943 --> 00:05:43,243
we found his dress shirt

93
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:46,943
that was smeared with an unbelievable amount of blood on it.

94
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:48,543
Oh, no!

95
00:05:48,543 --> 00:05:50,743
And, that blood was...

96
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:55,543
Yes, it was found to be Mr. Torihira's blood through DNA tests.

97
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:59,443
But, how did you find out it was Sugihito's dress shirt?

98
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,943
His fingerprints were also found

99
00:06:01,943 --> 00:06:04,343
on the buttons of that shirt.

100
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:07,943
I have a picture of it too.

101
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:09,543
Does it look familiar?

102
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:11,043
I can't say...

103
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:13,143
It look like a dress shirt that can be found anywhere, so...

104
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:14,643
May I see it too?

105
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:16,643
Conan.

106
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:20,143
This is...

107
00:06:20,143 --> 00:06:22,043
I guess I'll be heading back to the company then.

108
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:23,943
It's an hour drive from here,

109
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:25,643
so it's about time I get going.

110
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:29,343
Oh, yes. Your company's in Kanagawa.

111
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:31,743
If he ever contacts you,

112
00:06:31,743 --> 00:06:33,843
let me know by mail, okay?

113
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:37,843
I'll try to convince him to stop running around and go to the police.

114
00:06:37,843 --> 00:06:40,243
If he happens to get caught while on the run,

115
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:42,843
he may be set up as the culprit, besides.

116
00:06:42,843 --> 00:06:44,543
Okay.

117
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:46,243
See you.

118
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:50,043
Thank you for coming all this way.

119
00:06:52,743 --> 00:06:55,843
Was that man a good friend of your brother?

120
00:06:55,843 --> 00:06:58,443
Yep. It seems that they started working for the same section

121
00:06:58,443 --> 00:06:59,443
of the company from last month

122
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:01,743
and suddenly became friends.

123
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:05,043
I heard that he recently used to stay over at Sugihito's place a lot.

124
00:07:05,043 --> 00:07:07,943
After all, his apartment is near the company.

125
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:09,843
Oh, I see.

126
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:15,643
I'm sorry that we police officers are intruding on you like this too.

127
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,043
Oh, not at all. If I'm going to be watched either way,

128
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:20,943
it doesn't matter if it's from the inside or outside.

129
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:25,943
And I'd also like to prove that my brother isn't the culprit.

130
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:30,743
Just as I thought your room would be, Azusa.

131
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,243
It's cute.

132
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,443
You think so?

133
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:36,843
What a load of gifts too!

134
00:07:36,843 --> 00:07:38,643
Are these from the patrons of Poiroit?

135
00:07:38,643 --> 00:07:41,843
No. They're all from my brother.

136
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:44,243
He frequently buys queer gifts on his business trips

137
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:46,643
and sends them to me.

138
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:49,443
Talking about sending me stuff,

139
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:52,943
he also sends me queer pictures taken on his cell.

140
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:55,643
Even last night,

141
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:58,243
he sent me this strange photo.

142
00:07:58,243 --> 00:07:59,743
Snow?

143
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,243
Did it snow last night?

144
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:04,243
I guess it snowed quite a bit,

145
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:06,543
where my brother's apartment is.

146
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:09,743
Brother said he also sent it to Mr. Kawase.

147
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:11,743
But, can you imagine a person

148
00:08:11,743 --> 00:08:14,143
who sends pictures like this killing somebody?

149
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:16,043
True.

150
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:18,943
Besides, brother told me when he called me this morning

151
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,443
that he uses a shotgun for sporting clay,

152
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:24,143
and that handling a hunting rifle

153
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:26,343
is not easy.

154
00:08:26,343 --> 00:08:29,843
Well, about handling and stuff, it was...

155
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,043
A guest?

156
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:35,643
Were you expecting anyone?

157
00:08:35,643 --> 00:08:38,043
No.

158
00:08:38,043 --> 00:08:39,543
Which means...

159
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:42,143
Don't tell me it's...

160
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:46,443
Hello, delivery.

161
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,343
What is it?

162
00:08:48,343 --> 00:08:49,943
Nothing.

163
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:52,143
Who is it from?

164
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:56,243
It's from Mr. Sugihito Enomoto.

165
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:58,643
Brother.

166
00:08:58,643 --> 00:09:01,743
I hope you don't mind me checking the contents.

167
00:09:01,743 --> 00:09:03,543
Go ahead.

168
00:09:13,143 --> 00:09:15,143
-Here. -Thank you.

169
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:20,743
It's assorted cookies.

170
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:25,243
Hey, maybe there's a letter or something inside?

171
00:09:25,243 --> 00:09:29,843
It doesn't look to be so.

172
00:09:29,843 --> 00:09:34,243
Azusa, do the cookies bring anything to mind?

173
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:37,143
Azusa?

174
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,443
The cookies?

175
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:42,943
I love cookies, I think that's why he sent it to me.

176
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:46,543
See. The more he can't be a person would kill, right?

177
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:48,443
True.

178
00:09:50,443 --> 00:09:55,143
Oh, that's right. I have to go out shopping now.

179
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:59,843
To the neighborhood supermarket to buy groceries and a few other things.

180
00:09:59,843 --> 00:10:01,843
Would you like to come along?

181
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:03,843
Oh, yes, of course.

182
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:07,143
The person who first found the corpse

183
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:10,943
was Mrs. Torihira who came back this morning from a trip.

184
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,143
Yes, the estimated time of murder is

185
00:10:13,143 --> 00:10:17,643
probably between 22:00 - 23:00 last night.

186
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:20,243
Yes, right. Just around that time last night,

187
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:21,643
I had a hell of a time.

188
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:22,843
Hell of a time?

189
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:25,643
I had to go to the Kanagawa Prefectural Police Department

190
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:27,643
but the freeway was blocked

191
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:30,243
and the trains were delayed too.

192
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:31,943
An accident or something?

193
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:34,343
No, not an accident.

194
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:38,843
Yes, this is Chiba.

195
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:42,043
Oh, Officer Takagi. What is it?

196
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:46,543
Azusa split on you?

197
00:10:46,543 --> 00:10:48,543
Yeah, a message saying where to meet him

198
00:10:48,543 --> 00:10:50,243
was in the box of cookies she received a while ago, after all.

199
00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:53,243
It can't be! There was no message in it.

200
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:57,243
No, a message was definitely written there.

201
00:10:57,243 --> 00:11:00,743
In an unexpected place that only Azusa would notice.

202
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:04,843
Moreover, the person who sent it wasn't Sugihito,

203
00:11:04,843 --> 00:11:07,543
but most probably the real culprit.

204
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:11,743
He probably called Azusa to conceal everything.

205
00:11:12,743 --> 00:11:14,243
That person who from his own side,

206
00:11:14,243 --> 00:11:17,843
called himself a murderer through the slip of his tongue.

207
00:11:23,605 --> 00:11:25,805
You idiot!

208
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:28,005
Accompanying the younger sister of the suspect,

209
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:29,605
and yet letting her get away from you. What do you think you're doing?

210
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,305
I'm sorry.

211
00:11:31,305 --> 00:11:36,405
Ms. Enomoto, previously cooperated in solving cases

212
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,305
so I didn't think she would flee.

213
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:42,305
The one that is suspected of killing Mr. Torihira

214
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:45,905
is Azusa's older brother, Sugihito Enomoto.

215
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,705
The more she's a good younger sister,

216
00:11:47,705 --> 00:11:50,605
the more she would want to help her brother who is in trouble.

217
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:53,005
Didn't that dawn on you?

218
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:55,405
What would you have done then, Inspector?

219
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:56,605
She told me that she wanted to go

220
00:11:56,605 --> 00:12:01,005
to the underwear section to shop, so to wait a while.

221
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:02,905
I would've gone along with her anyway.

222
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:05,105
What if she says it's okay to go with her,

223
00:12:05,105 --> 00:12:07,205
but to not watch her too closely

224
00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:09,905
when she's choosing underwear!

225
00:12:09,905 --> 00:12:13,105
If she says that with a slightly

226
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:14,105
troubled blushing face?

227
00:12:14,105 --> 00:12:16,005
Then what?

228
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:17,905
Well, then I would have no choice.

229
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,005
Azusa pretty shrewd, isn't she?

230
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,305
Yep.

231
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:25,905
Come on. Stuff like that doesn't matter at this point!

232
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:28,305
The problem here is that

233
00:12:28,305 --> 00:12:30,805
we've completely lost track of the suspect.

234
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:32,605
But, Inspector,

235
00:12:32,605 --> 00:12:35,805
is Sugihito really the culprit?

236
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:38,405
His fingerprints were found on the murder weapon,

237
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:40,605
the rifle, and on top of that he's on the run right now.

238
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:43,005
And, furthermore, the blood smeared dress shirt

239
00:12:43,005 --> 00:12:44,805
that was found in trash box.

240
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,805
The blood that had splattered is Mr. Torihira's blood

241
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:49,505
and the fingerprints of Sugihito Enomoto

242
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:52,705
have also been found on the buttons of the dress shirt.

243
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:53,805
I guess we can say

244
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:55,505
there's a 10 to 1 chance that he's the culprit.

245
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:58,105
Oh, no!

246
00:12:58,105 --> 00:13:01,105
Hey, Conan, just what do you think you're doing?

247
00:13:01,105 --> 00:13:04,905
I got thirsty so I wanted to get the coke in the refrigerator.

248
00:13:04,905 --> 00:13:07,605
But, the coke gushed out.

249
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:12,305
Huh? My elbows and underarms aren't all that wet.

250
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:15,705
It's probably because you opened the can with your arms fixed in place.

251
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:16,905
I see.

252
00:13:16,905 --> 00:13:19,405
Armpits close against the body...

253
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:23,105
Inspector, there's something strange about this dress shirt.

254
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:25,305
What's strange about it?

255
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,105
Take a look at this, the armpit and elbow part.

256
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:31,105
Blood is splattered evenly and also on these parts.

257
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:33,805
Judging from the large amount of blood that is splattered on the shirt,

258
00:13:33,805 --> 00:13:37,205
the rifle must've been fired from point blank range.

259
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:39,605
In other words, the culprit didn't have to look through the scope,

260
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:41,805
but rather just held it under his arm and fired.

261
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:44,705
If so, the blood that would've splattered on the sides

262
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:46,805
and elbows should've been blocked.

263
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,705
However, since the dress shirt is bloody all over,

264
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:51,005
that's what somebody probably set up.

265
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:55,005
No, it's only natural that the shirt is bloody all over.

266
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:58,605
Mr. Torihira wasn't shot with the rifle,

267
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:02,605
but rather, struck to death with the handle part.

268
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:04,005
Is that so?

269
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:07,705
I also thought that he was shot with a rifle too.

270
00:14:07,705 --> 00:14:12,505
But, there was somebody who said exactly that, wasn't there?

271
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:16,505
Remember, Sugihito's colleague at work called Mr. Kawase.

272
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:21,205
He said that Sugihito was looking with interest into the gun barrel.

273
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:23,705
In other words, he wanted to say

274
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:27,305
that Sugihito's fingerprints are on the rifle, right?

275
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:29,305
It seems to be true that the culprit held the part of the rifle

276
00:14:29,305 --> 00:14:31,905
that's easiest to hold and struck the victim.

277
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,905
How did Mr. Kawase know about this?

278
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:35,105
When the only thing announced in the papers

279
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:37,605
is that the murder weapon is a rifle.

280
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:41,905
That's because Mr. Kawase is the very person who struck him.

281
00:14:41,905 --> 00:14:45,905
His tongue slipped because he is indeed the culprit.

282
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:49,905
But, didn't Mr. Kawase try to stand up for Sugihito?

283
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:53,705
He's the one that told us that Sugihito's fingerprints were there

284
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:55,705
because he touched it before, right?

285
00:14:55,705 --> 00:14:57,205
But, back then,

286
00:14:57,205 --> 00:15:00,405
he also said that Sugihito was excited, right?

287
00:15:00,405 --> 00:15:01,905
He also said that Mr. Torihira

288
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:05,705
thought Sugihito was a capable man.

289
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,905
I remember him saying that.

290
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:10,905
Sugihito was scolded a lot by Mr. Torihira, too.

291
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:13,505
I see. It looks like he's trying to back him up,

292
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:16,105
but it could be the exact opposite.

293
00:15:17,105 --> 00:15:20,205
But Mr. Sugihito Enomoto's fingerprints

294
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:21,905
were also found on the buttons of this dress shirt...

295
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:24,605
Oh, that's right. Mr. Kawase also said that

296
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:26,605
he stayed over a lot at Sugihito's place,

297
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:29,905
because his apartment was near the company.

298
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:33,605
I see! If he goes to work the next day after staying over,

299
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:36,905
he could've borrowed the dress shirt.

300
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:40,105
In other words, he could've kept the dress shirt he borrowed,

301
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,405
wore it just before committing the crime, then carried out his thing.

302
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:45,605
Right. Then, he disposed of it

303
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:49,205
at a trash dump near the Sugihito's apartment after committing the crime.

304
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:51,705
Then, why did he flee?

305
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:55,205
Maybe Mr. Kawase told him to.

306
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,405
By saying something like, "You touched that rifle, didn't you?

307
00:15:57,405 --> 00:16:00,805
If you're arrested now, you'll be caught and made the culprit."

308
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:04,205
It could be that Azusa was also called out by Mr. Kawase.

309
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:05,405
What?

310
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:08,605
Why does he have to call her out, too?

311
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:11,205
Oh, well... I just kind of thought so.

312
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:13,605
The cell phone photo, I think.

313
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:17,605
Remember, Sugihito sent an interesting picture

314
00:16:17,705 --> 00:16:19,905
to Azusa last night, right?

315
00:16:19,905 --> 00:16:22,905
It seems like he also sent it to the person called Kawase,

316
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:26,905
so I'm sure that man wanted to have it all to himself.

317
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:31,205
How stupid can you get? Why would he want to have

318
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:32,805
such a silly picture like that all for himself?

319
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:34,405
Snow?

320
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:37,705
That picture was of snow.

321
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,205
Officer Chiba, didn't you have a tough time last night

322
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:43,005
because of the snow?

323
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:47,405
Yeah. Just around the time of the murder between 22:00 and 23:00

324
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:49,205
when I was returning from the Kanagawa Prefectural Police Department,

325
00:16:49,205 --> 00:16:52,505
the freeway was closed and the trains were delayed because of the snow.

326
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:55,205
Hey, Sugihito's apartment

327
00:16:55,205 --> 00:16:57,405
was near his company in Kanagawa, right?

328
00:16:57,405 --> 00:17:01,305
Yes, an hour or so away from here.

329
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:05,305
The murder was committed in a condo in this neighbourhood...

330
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:10,005
Won't that picture serve as evidence?

331
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:12,805
Because transportation was paralyzed by snow.

332
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:16,805
Yeah, though digital photos are rarely used as evidence.

333
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,805
But, if the culprit thought it could be used,

334
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,905
he could've called out Sugihito's younger sister

335
00:17:21,905 --> 00:17:25,205
and told her to bring the photo in her cell phone

336
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:27,305
in order to get rid of the evidence.

337
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:29,605
But, how did he call her out?

338
00:17:29,605 --> 00:17:32,105
What we should suspect is the assorted cookies

339
00:17:32,105 --> 00:17:35,205
that came for Sugihito just a while ago.

340
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:38,805
Is it Azusa's birthday today?

341
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:41,805
I wonder... I don't think so, though. Why?

342
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:44,605
Because the parcel had a ribbon wrapped around it,

343
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,905
so I thought maybe it was a special present.

344
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:51,005
Well, since all the other parcels that Sugihito sent her

345
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:52,205
didn't have ribbons around them,

346
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:56,405
so that's why Azusa thought, "What kind it be?", right?

347
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:59,105
Hey! Where did she put that ribbon?

348
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:02,805
I'm sure she threw it in the trash basket together with the wrapper.

349
00:18:07,805 --> 00:18:11,705
A vacant warehouse 4 in 3rd district, Okuhocho.

350
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:13,405
Contact the police in this jurisdiction,

351
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:15,305
-and have them dispatch officers immediately. -Yes, sir.

352
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:17,905
Are we going to make it in time?

353
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:21,805
No, we most likely won't make it in time,

354
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:23,505
starting off now.

355
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:28,105
Sugihito, where are you?

356
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:31,005
You're here, aren't you? Sugihito!

357
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:32,905
Oh, Azusa?

358
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,305
Sugihito.

359
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:38,005
Why'd you come here?

360
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:39,205
What do you mean why?

361
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:40,805
You wrote the address of this place

362
00:18:40,805 --> 00:18:44,105
on the ribbon of the parcel you sent me and told to come here.

363
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:47,605
That's why I mailed Mr. Kawase, too and called him out here.

364
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:51,005
So that he could convince you to stop running around

365
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,705
and go to the police if you're really innocent.

366
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:57,705
Stop running around? I mean he's the one who told me

367
00:18:57,705 --> 00:18:59,905
to run for it and hide here, too.

368
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,805
He? Just what do you mean?

369
00:19:05,505 --> 00:19:07,305
Azusa!

370
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:09,905
This is what it means.

371
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:14,605
I've been waiting for two hours now, Azusa,

372
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:16,905
for you to come here.

373
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,605
You were waiting here?

374
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:19,705
Yeah.

375
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:23,405
Because you sent me such a meaningless cell phone picture.

376
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:27,305
Okay then. You brought your cell phone with you like I told you to.

377
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:30,005
Cell phone photo? You mean the one I sent you last night?

378
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:33,605
Yeah, it'll serve as your alibi, despite me

379
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,205
going out of my way to set you up as the killer.

380
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:39,305
Don't tell me that you're the one who killed department head Torihira?

381
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:40,705
Yeah, that's right.

382
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:44,105
I bought the stocks of the company and really lost out

383
00:19:44,105 --> 00:19:46,705
and had a debt of 1 billion yen.

384
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:49,805
And old man Torihira found out about it.

385
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,605
He told me that he'll make me pay him back

386
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:55,105
even if I have to do so all my life, so I shut him up.

387
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:57,405
It was right after that

388
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,505
I got that cell phone picture from you.

389
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:05,105
If you didn't send me that cell phone photo,

390
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:07,805
Azusa didn't have to die.

391
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:08,805
Wait!

392
00:20:08,805 --> 00:20:10,405
If you don't want your little sister to die,

393
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:12,405
write a will right here and now.

394
00:20:12,405 --> 00:20:15,105
Later put your neck through the rope.

395
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:18,905
And you know what to do, right?

396
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:21,005
Why you!

397
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:24,105
If you write it well, I'll save your little sister.

398
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:26,605
Fortunately, she hasn't heard my voice

399
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:29,405
and it seems she also trusted me too,

400
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:32,605
so write it well, now. Bad mouth Torihira

401
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:35,305
and write the reason why you decided to stop running.

402
00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:39,305
Write a prize sob story that will bring tears to the dumb police.

403
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,905
No, no!

404
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:43,905
That won't bring tears to our eyes at all.

405
00:20:43,905 --> 00:20:46,505
I mean a silly story like that would dry tears

406
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:49,505
rather than make them flow.

407
00:20:49,505 --> 00:20:52,405
If I were you, I would rewrite the script this way.

408
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:57,305
A tomboy police officer raids the site in the nick of time

409
00:20:57,305 --> 00:20:59,905
and succeeds in getting hold of the suspect.

410
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:01,705
I think this story will be more favoured

411
00:21:01,705 --> 00:21:03,205
being it's a happy ending, don't you?

412
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:05,805
Why's a police officer here?

413
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:08,705
Nobody was tailing Azusa!

414
00:21:08,705 --> 00:21:11,405
I came here directly from a different route.

415
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:15,105
Don't tell me that ribbon trick was disclosed?

416
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:18,605
It could be, because I was contacted by mail to come here

417
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:20,805
since the real culprit will be coming here.

418
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:22,905
Well, as to who the person that contacted me is,

419
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:26,905
I will not reveal it since I was told not to tell.

420
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:04,105
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused you.

421
00:23:04,105 --> 00:23:06,305
I was scolded a bit at the police station.

422
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:09,005
After all, I fled from the police officer.

423
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:11,105
Well, everything turned out fine.

424
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:13,505
Your brother was found innocent too.

425
00:23:13,505 --> 00:23:17,405
Now, you'll be freed by all those officers with threatening looking eyes.

426
00:23:20,405 --> 00:23:23,205
Hey, hey, officers are still around?

427
00:23:23,205 --> 00:23:26,105
Oh, the officers come here often these days,

428
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:28,305
ever since they ate the special pasta dish

429
00:23:28,305 --> 00:23:30,405
the other day when they were staking me out,

430
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:33,305
saying that it's really delicious.

431
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:35,805
Is something wrong?

432
00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:39,705
Oh, no... I'm happy for you.

433
00:23:39,705 --> 00:23:42,005
Boy! It looks so much like the officers room

434
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,205
that I don't feel comfortable.

435
00:23:47,205 --> 00:23:51,105
"Next Episode."

436
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:56,005
This rapier is genuine.

437
00:24:02,605 --> 00:24:04,705
Maybe he got lost because this place is so big.

438
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:06,505
I'll go look for him.

439
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:11,705
Oh, come on. Where are you, Conan?

440
00:24:11,705 --> 00:24:13,205
Next Conan,

441
00:24:13,205 --> 00:24:17,305
"Malice Hidden In The Masque."

442
00:24:28,105 --> 00:24:30,205
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:32,805
"Stone coffin."

444
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,705
Stone but it's not the Rolling Stones!

445
00:24:34,705 --> 00:24:36,405
Repent Takagi!
