You imbecile who blasphemies the passage of time,

00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:09,861
as punishment for this,

4
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:13,061
I shall stop your time with my invisible sword

Wait.

8
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:23,661
This is blackmail of forewarning of the intent of murder.

00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:24,961
Yes.

"Hoshina Family Butler" -when Mrs. Hoshina's birthday approaches,

12
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,261
it's been sent here.

13
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:32,961
That letter with no sender's name on it.

14
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:35,561
But despite it coming from two years ago,

15
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:36,861
that is, last year as well as the year before last,

16
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:39,161
Mrs. Hoshina is fine, isn't she?

17
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:40,161
Yes.

18
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:43,961
Her birthday went well with nothing bad happening.

19
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:49,861
However, since she tells the guests about the letter,

20
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:52,761
the number of guests attending the party

21
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,461
keep decreasing year after year.

22
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:56,861
Therefore, you want me, Kogoro Mouri

23
00:00:56,861 --> 00:01:01,461
to find out who the sender of that letter is?

24
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,561
Yes, sir!

25
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:06,461
So, we would like you to come to Mrs. Hoshina's 50th birthday party

26
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:10,561
and serve as her bodyguard.

27
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:12,861
A middle-aged lady in her fifties?

28
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:16,861
No, I'd like to decline the bodyguard part.

29
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:20,561
We were planning to pay you about this much.

30
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:28,461
I'll accept the work!

31
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:30,361
Thank you so very much.

32
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:31,461
So,

33
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:35,761
what does blasphemy the passage of time mean?

34
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,061
Who knows?

35
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:40,561
Maybe it means somebody is going against time to the point of corruption?

36
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:45,661
If so, is that lady really not punctual or something?

37
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:47,361
No.

38
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:48,861
Well...

39
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:50,861
it's completely the other way around.

40
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:55,661
Like the fog clears.

41
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:57,861
Let's see through love and crime as well.

42
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:59,561
A blackmail warning that time will be stopped is delivered.

43
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:01,761
Fear sweeps through the birthday party.

44

2 minutes and 17 seconds late.

49
00:04:00,217 --> 00:04:04,217
You promised to come at 14:30, didn't you, Detective Mouri?

50
00:04:04,217 --> 00:04:05,517
Well...

51
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:08,717
it was quite a walk from the garage to here

52
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:10,917
and moreover, it was also raining.

Yes, ma'am! I'll have them fix it immediately!

58

67
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:53,417
No, they're just like humans.

68
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,217
Unless you perform maintenance on them sometimes

69
00:04:55,217 --> 00:04:58,017
like people go to get a physical exam,

70
00:04:58,017 --> 00:05:00,717
they will rust and soon start malfunctioning.

74
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:08,517
the cogwheels wear out

75

and the springs also gradually become weak.

76
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:14,417
Who are they?

77
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:17,317
Mr. Karube who designed this building

78
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,317
and Ms. Suou who was in charge of interior decorating.

79
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:21,817
And he's Mr. Furugaki who made the grand clock

80
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:25,417
that is here in this building.

81

They're all guests who were invited to tonight's party.

82

I just came to check on the grand clock.

83
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:37,217
I just happened to be at your birthday party while I was at it.

84
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:40,117
Sorry, but I'm helping myself in.

85
00:05:40,117 --> 00:05:41,917
I gave my word to an old friend

86
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:43,617
that I would take care of that grand clock

87
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:46,917
as long as I'm alive, you see.

88
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:49,117
An old friend?

89
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:51,917
A clock technician that was hired here before.

90
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,817
He was a very outstandingly skilled

91
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:56,117
and until he died of an accident four years ago,

92
00:05:56,117 --> 00:06:00,217
he was in charge of almost all the clocks in this building.

93
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:03,117
If I remember correctly, was he your older brother?

94
00:06:03,117 --> 00:06:04,217
Yes!

95
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:05,517
I got to do the interior here

96
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:08,017
because he introduced me here.

97
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:10,417
Oh, that's right, ma'am!

98
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:13,317
I found a really nice carpet,

99
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:15,517
but would you like to see a sample of it?

100
00:06:15,517 --> 00:06:17,817
-Later then. -Yes, ma'am!

101
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:19,017
Well,

102
00:06:19,017 --> 00:06:21,617
shall we all go inside instead of standing here talking.

103
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:24,517
I shall keep your umbrellas for you.

104
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,817
Thank you.

105
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:27,417
Sure.

106
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:29,817
-Thank you. -No problem.

107
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:31,517
Not me,

108
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:32,917
because it's a folding umbrella.

109
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,017
I see.

110
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:35,217
Here you go.

111
00:06:35,217 --> 00:06:37,617
I shall take it for you.

112
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:38,817
But,

113
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:41,417
talk about a huge number of clocks!

114
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,517
Really.

115
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:46,517
Did you buy all this, Mrs. Hoshina?

116
00:06:46,517 --> 00:06:47,617
Yes.

117
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:49,117
My late husband who died of an illness last year,

118
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,717
used to always complain about them

119
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:55,017
saying, "I feel like I married clocks".

120
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:59,717
Well, it's true that I'm entranced by clocks,

121
00:06:59,717 --> 00:07:02,317
the cute tick-tocking sound

122
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:06,317
and the sound that it plays when the long hand faces the top of the clock.

123
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:14,617
It's true

124
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:17,417
that it sure is grand when they start sounding altogether.

125
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:18,517
True!

126
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:21,117
It's lively and almost like being at an amusement park!

127
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:23,417
-Mr. Oume. -Yes, ma'am?

128
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:26,417
One of the clocks is 0.5 seconds late!

129
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:28,917
What's going on?

130
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,417
I'm sorry!

131
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,117
I'll have it fixed immediately!

132
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:34,417
Then, go and tell him

133
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:36,117
just in case that unless all the clocks

134
00:07:36,117 --> 00:07:40,217
sound in unison at 6:00 p.m. sharp, the time I was born,

135
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:42,317
he's fired!

136
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:43,917
I understand!

137
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:50,917
Nobody can adjust the clocks like your older brother did, after all.

138
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:56,217
I hired three people already to take his place after he passed away,

139
00:07:56,217 --> 00:08:00,717
and yet there are one or two clocks that are late every week.

140
00:08:00,717 --> 00:08:04,717
But not so for that large clock that comes with the building.

141
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:08,117
It's only been late a number of times during the past 10 years.

142
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:12,017
Well, the very one who made it comes every year to tune it up

143
00:08:12,017 --> 00:08:13,717
so I guess it's only natural, but...

144
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:21,217
Fantastic!

145
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:25,217
This sure is quite overwhelming.

146
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,417
I wonder what this door is.

147
00:08:31,217 --> 00:08:33,217
You mean the face of this clock

148
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:36,017
is also in view on the backyard side!

149
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:40,917
It's the man from before.

150
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:43,917
Why is he facing the well and praying?

151
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:47,417
It's because he fell there and died.

152
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:50,417
My older brother, who used to be a clock technician here,

153
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:52,617
was repairing the face of the grand clock

154
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,717
when he was blown by the wind and...

155
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:58,317
The well was here before we rebuilt this place.

156
00:08:58,317 --> 00:09:01,117
People are supposed to be here next week and bury it

157
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:03,117
because it's dangerous.

158
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:06,417
Everyone, I guess I'll offer my prayers later too then.

159
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:11,617
I used to be childhood friends with him, you see.

160
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:14,617
Please pray on my behalf too then.

161
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:16,917
Aren't you going to offer your prayers?

162
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:18,517
You're his baby sister, aren't you?

163
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:22,917
I already offered my prayers this morning.

164
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:25,717
Today is the day he passed away.

165
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:27,817
He died today?

166
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,917
In an accident on Mrs. Hoshina's birthday?

167
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:30,917
Yes.

168
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:34,817
Well, I'll tell you the details in my room.

169
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:38,817
I would like Detective Mouri to find out

170
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:41,817
who the sender of that blackmail is too.

171
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:42,917
Yes.

172
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:01,817
It was nothing.

173
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:02,817
So you mean,

174
00:10:02,817 --> 00:10:05,417
she didn't tell you anything about the accident after all?

175
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:06,617
No,

176
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:09,317
she did tell me about the guy who she has business with

177
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,317
that hates her in detail, though.

178
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:14,217
So, the name of the sender of that letter

179
00:10:14,217 --> 00:10:17,117
was "The timekeeper" right?

180
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,617
So what?

181
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:20,417
If so, then...

182
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:24,017
clock technicians are also timekeepers, aren't they?

183
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:27,517
Then, are you saying that the three clock technicians that she's hired

184
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:29,317
are the ones who sent her the blackmail?

185
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:31,817
It's just a possibility.

186
00:10:31,817 --> 00:10:34,017
But if so,

187
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:36,017
it seems more likely that Mrs. Hoshina who's very particular about time

188
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:38,817
would be the timekeeper.

189
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:40,717
Mr. Oume, I think it's about time.

190
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:42,317
Yes, ma'am.

191
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:47,317
It's been bothering me from some time ago,

192
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:50,817
but that gold watch... May I have a look at it?

193
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,517
Yes, go ahead.

194
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:56,417
Very nice.

195
00:10:56,417 --> 00:11:00,817
Well! The silver flashlight clock was nice too,

196
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:03,617
but this one matches you too, Mrs. Hoshina!

197
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:07,517
This is a one of a kind specially ordered watch

198
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:09,517
that I had a Swiss clock craftsman make for me.

199
00:11:12,217 --> 00:11:14,917
I feel sorry for the watches that are on the verge of rusting

200
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:17,917
being put away in drawers just because of their capricious owner

201
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:19,617
who wants to purchase them at will.

202
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:22,117
You need not worry about that.

203
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,617
That watch has already been...

204
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:27,817
I don't have it anymore.

205
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:32,317
It broke, so I disposed of it.

206
00:11:35,317 --> 00:11:37,817
-No. -A blackout?

207
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:38,917
Oh, no!

208
00:11:50,117 --> 00:11:51,217
Come on,

209
00:11:51,217 --> 00:11:53,617
she's going to blow out the candles of her birthday cake?

210
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:12,417
Hey, what's going on?

211
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,817
What? What's the matter?

212
00:12:21,217 --> 00:12:23,317
Somebody fled from the window?

213
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:26,117
What was that?

214
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:27,317
The light!

215
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:28,917
Somebody, turn on the light!

216
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,420
I see.

217
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,220
After the candles on the birthday cake were blown out,

218
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,720
right after the room became dark,

219
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,720
someone pierced the chest of the owner of this building,

220
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,420
Rukako Hoshina in one blow.

221
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,920
Then within the few seconds before the lights were turned on again,

222
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,120
the culprit fled along with the weapon,

223
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,820
going out to the backyard through the window facing it?

224
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,520
Yes, sir. Please take a look at

225
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,120
the blood that splattered on the floor when Mrs. Hoshina was stabbed.

226
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,920
Just about here, there are no blood stains, are there?

227
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,820
This is evidence that when the culprit pulled the knife out,

228
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,420
he was standing here

229
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,820
and a lot of blood would've splattered on him.

230
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,620
In spite of this, although the people who are in this room

231
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,320
may have a slight amount of blood on them,

232
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,420
no one seems to have been splattered with a huge amount of blood.

233
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,420
Moreover, on the window frames and handrail of the balcony there

234
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,520
are traces of smeared blood.

235
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,420
Inspector, there is no doubt that the culprit

236
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,220
who was splattered with the victim's blood fled out that window.

237
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,120
But if so, Mr. Mouri,

238
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,420
the thing that's supposed to be here isn't.

239
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,720
This is the second floor.

240
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,220
If it was raining till evening and the ground was wet,

241
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,420
an obvious definite trace of it should be here, shouldn't it?

242
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,220
Traces of the shoe prints of the culprit

243
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,020
when he jumped to the ground from this balcony.

244
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,820
That... that's ridiculous!

245
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,120
It's started to rain again.

246
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,820
Are you sure that there are really no footprints of the culprit?

247
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,820
There were none.

248
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,920
Then, maybe the one who sent the blackmail

249
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,720
was the clock technician that died four years ago.

250
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,120
Idiot!

251
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,620
How can a dead person send a letter?

252
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,820
But...

253
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,820
the sender was "Timekeeper", right?

254
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,620
A clock technician is also a timekeeper, no?

255
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,020
What's this blackmail thing about?

256
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,320
It seems to have been sent to the madam, the victim,

257
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,520
from about two years ago.

258
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,620
"I shall stop your time with my invisible sword

259
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,120
at the exact time that you were born into this world"

260
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,820
is what it says in the blackmail.

261
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,520
The time that she was born in this world?

262
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,020
It seems that the victim was born at exactly 18:00 today.

263
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,120
And she also seems to have blown out the candles

264
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,320
at 18:00 sharp every year.

265
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,920
And?

266
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,520
Did that clock technician who died four years ago

267
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,620
have a grudge against the victim?

268
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,320
I... I'm not sure of the details,

269
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,720
but it seems that he died of an accident

270
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,920
on the very day of Mrs. Hoshina's birthday.

271
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,820
He didn't die.

272
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,620
He was killed!

273
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,120
By that callous woman who was dominated by time,

274
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,120
as if she were God or something.

275
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,920
It was a very stormy day, back then.

276
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,420
It was so bad

277
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,620
that despite the clock technician who is tied to a rope

278
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,820
to keep from falling while fixing the face of the clock

279
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,920
was blown by the wind and fell into the well below.

280
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,420
But wasn't it an accident?

281
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,820
Yeah.

282
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,520
It would've been just a plain stupid accident,

283
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,220
if that lady

284
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,220
didn't insist on celebrating her birthday party at 18:00 sharp,

285
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,320
and went to look for the clock technician.

286
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,620
You mean she went on having the party despite one person missing?

287
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,020
Yes. Therefore, his body ended up being found the following morning.

288
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,620
According to the police,

289
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,720
it seems that he drowned to death

290
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,520
during the time the party was being held,

291
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,420
because the well had water in it.

292
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,820
Well, if somebody else went out to look for my older brother,

293
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,920
he may have made it alive too, though.

294
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
Once the party begins,

295
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,420
I got so busy

296
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,020
that I have no time to go look for anybody.

297
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,420
Inspector.

298
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,420
It sounds like the one who would've most hated the victim

299
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,020
is that clock technician that passed away.

300
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,320
Come on.

301
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,520
Just as I thought.

302
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,520
The killer is that person's ghost.

303
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,720
That's why we heard no footsteps either.

304
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,720
If so, then the ghost must've had really bad eyes.

305
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,620
Because look at Mrs. Hoshina's necklace.

306
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,420
It shines in the dark.

307
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,120
I'm sure that it has fluorescent paint on it.

308
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,320
So that everyone would know where she is despite it getting dark.

309
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,520
Hey!

310
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,420
Who's the one that painted the necklace?

311
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,520
She was letting a lot of people touch it during the party.

312
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,920
This party was also one in which she planned

313
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,620
to show her newly bought accessories

314
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,220
to the guests who came, so...

315
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,620
Come to think of it, she was also showing off

316
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,420
and letting everyone touch her gold flashlight watch too.

317
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,720
Then,

318
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,320
isn't the guest with fluorescent paint on his fingers the culprit?

319
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
Well, if I were the culprit,

320
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,720
I would've washed it off in the restroom by now though.

321
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,120
If we could at least specify the suspects down

322
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,720
to a few people with the fingerprints.

323
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,820
I'm sure a lot of people touched it.

324
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,220
How stupid, Pops.

325
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,820
If a ghost touched it,

326
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,520
there would be no detectable fingerprints.

327
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,020
Because a ghost can flee like air, with nobody noticing,

328
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,420
floating through the air.

329
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,320
You're the one who's stupid!

330
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,020
A ghost wouldn't possibly go through the trouble of coming out

331
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,020
to paint fluorescent paint on the necklace, then stab somebody in the dark!

332
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,520
But,

333
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,220
you didn't find any footprints of anyone fleeing, right?

334
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,420
If the culprit's not a ghost,

335
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,420
then, that person deceived everybody into believing that he fled

336
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,920
and yet could still be here, right?

337
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,620
I see!

338
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,920
The culprit could've smeared blood

339
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,620
on the railing of the balcony and the window frame beforehand.

340
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,120
To make it look as if he fled outside after opening the window.

341
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,520
Moreover, if the culprit hasn't gone outside yet, it means that

342
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,620
it is highly likely that he still has

343
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,020
the ice pick like long sharp murder weapon that he used to stab

344
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,520
and pierce right through the heart of the victim on him!

345
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,620
Okay, then,

346
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,020
let's have each of you come one by one to another room

347
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,120
so that we can interrogate you and do a body check.

348
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,620
Hold it!

349
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,820
What about the blood that splattered from the victim to the culprit?

350
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,920
According to you,

351
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,820
the culprit should've gotten a lot of blood on himself, right?

352
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,320
Right,

353
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,120
unless that's cleared,

354
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,020
I don't feel like going through an interrogation or body check either.

355
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,620
Right.

356
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,320
To think that we're not even suspects and are being investigated anyway...

357
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,720
Is rude, don't you think?

358
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Well, it's just to be sure.

359
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,420
I'm sorry,

360
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,620
but I've got other things to attend to, so I'm leaving.

361
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,920
-Me too, then. -Same here.

362
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,320
Please wait!

363
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,520
Please wait, everyone!

364
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,120
Do you all understand

365
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,120
that a person has died?

366
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,420
We've all come here today

367
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,020
to celebrate Mrs. Hoshina's birthday.

368
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,520
If the culprit who has done harm to her may be here,

369
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,120
isn't it only right to cooperate with the police?

370
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,520
If things are left as is,

371
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,020
the ghost of the clock technician who was my childhood friend

372
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,420
could end up being the killer too.

373
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,220
So you're an architect.

374
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,520
I'm Karube,

375
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,920
the one who designed this building.

376
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,420
Your hands and sleeves have blood on them.

377
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,820
It probably got there

378
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,820
when I ran over to Mrs. Hoshina who fell to the floor.

379
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,420
But there's no blood anywhere else is there?

380
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,720
No.

381
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,520
And? Is there anything

382
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,220
that you noticed at the time of the crime?

383
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,520
Come to think of it,

384
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,820
I think I heard something like cloth

385
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,620
being rubbed against something approaching,

386
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,120
so the culprit could be a woman who is wearing a dress.

387
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,220
By the way, the mouthpiece of your pipe

388
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,620
also looks long and sharp.

389
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,120
Is it all right if I check it?

390
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Sure.

391
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,720
Hey! Enough already!

392
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,820
It's true that the clock technician who died four years ago

393
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,120
was my older brother,

394
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,220
so I have the most motive to be the killer

395
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,320
but that was an unfortunate accident!

396
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,420
I had no grudge against Mrs. Hoshina.

397
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,020
But you were given charge of decorating the interior of this building.

398
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,220
Therefore, you could've rigged this place any way you wanted to.

399
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,520
As to that, Mr. Karube the architect,

400
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,320
as well as Mr. Furugaki who made the grand clock

401
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,920
would also be in the same boat.

402
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,420
But I guess Mr. Furugaki who is quite aged shouldn't be included.

403
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,920
Why not?

404
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,620
The culprit after stabbing Mrs. Hoshina,

405
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,620
went pass my left side quite swiftly!

406
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:11,820
So, see, there is a smear of blood on my left arm, isn't there?

407
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:17,120
By the way, the thing that you're wearing in your hair...

408
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,720
This is a hairpin that my older brother bought for me some time ago.

409
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,420
May I check it, please?

410
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,520
You can check it all you want!

411
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,820
But make sure that you give it back to me later!

412
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,820
Yes, ma'am.

413
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,020
I mean it's not a samurai movie or anything,

414
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,920
so I couldn't possibly have a sword or the like on me.

415
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,220
I guess not.

416
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,020
It was you, wasn't it?

417
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,220
The clock technician that made that grand clock.

418
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,020
Yeah, I'm Furugaki.

419
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,120
Your right shoulder

420
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,420
seems to have a bit of splattered blood on it.

421
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,320
It seems that woman was stabbed to my right, so...

422
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,220
It seems to be a pretty old cane,

423
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,120
have you been using it for long?

424
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,220
Yeah. This cane was given to me ten years ago

425
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,020
by the clock technician that we were talking about a while ago.

426
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,620
I could care less,

427
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,520
but I think the culprit is someone who is quite fat.

428
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,320
Just before that woman screamed,

429
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,720
I was pushed by a soft resilient body.

430
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,020
I'm sure the culprit

431
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,520
is someone who was in this large reception back then.

432
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,520
Who on earth is the culprit

433
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,120
who calls himself "The Timekeeper"?

434
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,020
"Next Episode"

435
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,520
I see, I got it!

436
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,020
The Timekeeper really passed through here

437
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,620
at the time of the crime!

438
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,420
Dad?

439
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,820
I'm spinning around and around.

440
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,920
I was almost about to fall

441
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,120
for the scheme

442
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,520
that the culprit set up.

443
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,820
Next Conan,

444
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,620
"The Blade of the Timekeeper (Part 2)".
