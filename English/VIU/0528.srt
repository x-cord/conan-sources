1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What? You have an appointment with someone?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,200
Right now?

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,300
Yes, that's right.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,500
Since you called for us to come at this hour,

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,100
I was sure we were going out to have dinner.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,400
Dad just happens to be out

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,500
drinking with the master of Poirot and the others.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,900
Well, it can't be helped.

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,900
There's someone I wanted you to meet.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,100
"Mouri Detective Agency" -All right, looks like it's time to go.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,300
It's fax.

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,300
What's this about?

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,200
No way!

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,700
A catch-22 crisis is gracefully revived.

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,000
The table is turned and the mystery solved!

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,500
A three-way battle among a woman judo champion, Kogoro and Eri.

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,200
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,200
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,300
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

20
00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:43,143
"Might Over Mystery (Part 1)"

21
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Troubled by a stalker?

22
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,020
Your acquaintance, Mom?

23
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,120
Well... Her husband was taken to court in the past,

24
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,420
in order to settle a traffic accident.

25
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,020
Oh, remember the judo player Yuko Arisawa!

26
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,320
You know her, don't you?

27
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,920
I do, I do!

28
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,320
They say that, if she hadn't got injured,

29
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,320
she would have won a gold medal at the Olympics!

30
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,220
She's the former All-Japan champion for the 70kg class, right?

31
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,020
But if it's her, wouldn't the stalker be the one running away?

32
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,420
No. Even though she was the one who approached me,

33
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,720
it was her husband that was concerned.

34
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
What?

35
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,520
He was suddenly on edge,

36
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,120
and noted that ever since the traffic accident,

37
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,820
it seemed like someone was always watching him.

38
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,220
It seems he isn't sleeping at night, either.

39
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,620
Then, maybe the stalker's the victim of the traffic accident?

40
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,020
I'm not convinced that's the case.

41
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,420
The victim came to a mutual understanding

42
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,720
that it had been his own fault, and settled privately.

43
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,220
Also, it seems the victim has completely recovered from his injuries.

44
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,020
Then, who is the stalker?

45
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,420
She tried to convince him otherwise,

46
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,920
and even told him, "It's probably your imagination",

47
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,920
but he won't listen to her.

48
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,420
That's why she wants me to come.

49
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,320
If there aren't any wiretaps or cameras,

50
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,920
we can prove there isn't a stalker.

51
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,120
But why are you going, Ms. Kisaki?

52
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,420
I wonder. Her husband seemed very grateful

53
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,220
during the settlement proceedings before,

54
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,320
so she probably thought that he would believe what I tell him.

55
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,920
No, that's not what I mean.

56
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,020
Huh?

57
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,020
I mean, why didn't you ask Pops to handle the case?

58
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,320
-What? -That's right...

59
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,920
Mom is a lawyer! Dad is a detective!

60
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,320
If it's a stalker case, a detective is...

61
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Because I didn't want to!

62
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,420
Isn't that reason enough?

63
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,320
Of course that's not "enough" at all!

64
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,920
Well, considering the things Pops usually does...

65
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,720
Strike!

66
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,020
Oh, no!

67
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,420
Jackpot!

68
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,820
It may just be a waste of time asking him to do the job.

69
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,020
What's this?

70
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,120
While you have no problem coming to another's defense,

71
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,120
you won't intercede when it comes to your personal affairs, huh.

72
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,420
"Yuko Arisawa (37)" -Don't you think it's time.

73
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,620
"Judo player" -for you to forgive your husband, Ms. Kisaki?

74
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,920
Yuko Arisawa! It's really her!

75
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,020
I'm afraid that's impossible for the time being.

76
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,520
Before I do, I'll wait for him to demonstrate his sincerity.

77
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,420
Then, why not go on and divorce him?

78
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,420
No, well, that's...

79
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,720
Well, at least he was able to give you a lovely daughter.

80
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,420
I guess it's not that easy.

81
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,720
Oh, my. Did you have a son as well?

82
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,420
No, he's a boy of our acquaintance who's staying with us for now.

83
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,620
Well, at any rate, shall we head over to your house?

84
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,520
I'm sure your husband is waiting, too.

85
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,720
Yes, you're right.

86
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,820
Since it's about time for him to return from the office,

87
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,020
so I'll give him a call.

88
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,920
That's strange.

89
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,720
No answer.

90
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,320
Could he be taking a bath?

91
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Oh, dear.

92
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,120
Where are you?

93
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,420
I'm at a wake.

94
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,620
What? A wake?

95
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,620
Yeah, someone I know passed away,

96
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,820
so I came to his wake.

97
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,520
You can hear the chanting, can't you?

98
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,320
The speaker phone?

99
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,420
So yeah, I'll be home late so go to bed ahead of me.

100
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,520
Ahead of you? It's tonight, you know!

101
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,720
Lawyer Kisaki is coming over now to discuss the stalker problem.

102
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,820
Was that today?

103
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,220
I'm at Lawyer Kisaki's office right now.

104
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,220
I'll put her on!

105
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,320
Yes, this is Kisaki speaking.

106
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,020
Well, no...

107
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,320
If it's truly an inconvenience,

108
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,020
we can meet on a more suitable day.

109
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,020
Yes.

110
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,720
Is that so? We will review the situation then.

111
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,720
How was he?

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,120
He said he'll be arriving home at 9:25,

113
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,920
so I'll meet with him then.

114
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,420
25 minutes later... That's really peculiar, isn't it?

115
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,520
Normally, wouldn't you say 9:00 or 9:30?

116
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,620
He's just really punctual.

117
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,320
He's rarely late for anything without a reason.

118
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,320
It does seem like he completely forgot

119
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,220
about Lawyer Kisaki coming over tonight, though.

120
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,720
Furthermore, we still have another two hours until 9:30.

121
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,220
Then, how about if we have dinner at a nearby hotel restaurant?

122
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,320
Actually, while I were killing time in the cafe until the appointment,

123
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,320
my car was in the parking lot of the hotel.

124
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,920
Not to mention, the parking fee will be cheaper.

125
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,920
In that case, is it all right if these two come along?

126
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,720
Why, of course!

127
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,320
You won the karate tournament championship!

128
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,620
That's amazing, Ran!

129
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,520
Thank you very much.

130
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,220
But didn't you do so, as well?

131
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,920
No. My talent developed later on!

132
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,520
I was first crowned a champion in university.

133
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,120
Given the comparatively high injury rate,

134
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,820
my peak lasted only two, three years.

135
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,720
And after retiring, I got married.

136
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,520
I still haven't been able to achieve my dream of earning the gold medal

137
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,720
in front of the superior I admired so much.

138
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,920
The superior you admired?

139
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,120
He's currently the coach for the all Japan team, Hajime Kajimoto.

140
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,920
At one time, he was an unrivalled gold medalist in the 81kg class.

141
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,920
I took up judo after seeing him on TV.

142
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,220
It's the same as me, then.

143
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,220
I admire the karate champion of Japan.

144
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,220
But admiration is admiration.

145
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,020
It's the same as viewing flower from afar.

146
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,920
When you get too close,

147
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
it becomes like Icarus who lost his wings

148
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,720
and plunged to the earth after flying too close to the sun.

149
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,320
Disaster befalls oneself.

150
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,020
I'm sorry to drop that remark.

151
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,220
No.

152
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,020
-But I'm glad I brought Ran with me. -What?

153
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,020
I called you to my office so that you could see her.

154
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,620
Since you both practice martial arts,

155
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,120
I figured you'd both have something in common.

156
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,920
I didn't think we'd be having dinner together though.

157
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,620
Then, why didn't you call Dad as well?

158
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,920
Dad actually practiced judo!

159
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,320
Now that you mentioned it, I suppose he did.

160
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,920
The truth is, I was worried.

161
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
What?

162
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,220
I wasn't sure whether or not he was on a case,

163
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,120
so I decided against using the hand of such a renowned detective.

164
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,920
Is that so?

165
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,920
If that's the case, you should have mentioned it from the start!

166
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,320
Well, didn't I mention it?

167
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,920
-Say? -Yes, what?

168
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,720
Isn't it about time to go?

169
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,220
You said it would take ten minutes

170
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,220
to get to your house by car, right?

171
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,520
That's true.

172
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,720
But before we go, I need to go to the bathroom.

173
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
Wasn't it delicious, that blend of western and Japanese style food?

174
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,520
Yes, absolutely.

175
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,420
Do you come here often?

176
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,220
Yeah, I make sure I come once a week!

177
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,920
With your husband, right?

178
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,220
Nope, I come alone without telling him.

179
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,620
My husband has zero tolerance for new food.

180
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,720
Oh, yeah?

181
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,920
Let's see, where did I park?

182
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,320
Isn't it that white car?

183
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,120
When I saw you with your husband before,

184
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,220
that's the car you were driving, right?

185
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,220
Yep, yep! That's it!

186
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,220
Then, I'll give Ran and the boy a ride as well.

187
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,820
We'll pass right by the detective agency on the way home.

188
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
Thank you very much.

189
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,420
You know how to adjust the seat, don't you?

190
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,920
There's a lever on the right side of the seat.

191
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,420
And if you pull it...

192
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,120
See, like this, the seat will move.

193
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,620
No need to worry, my car has the same thing.

194
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,120
Well, sonny,

195
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,920
we'll get there right away so stay put, okay?

196
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,620
Huh? The parking ticket...

197
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,720
Where did I put it?

198
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,720
I'm afraid you'll have to pay the daily maximum of 3,000 yen.

199
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,520
Guess it can't be helped.

200
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,020
If you don't mind, I'll gladly pay half.

201
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,020
It's fine, because it's my fault.

202
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,720
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,920
The children are truly being an inconvenience.

204
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,520
Not at all.

205
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,220
It's because you insisted on having it your way, Conan.

206
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,220
Because, if she's the former All-Japan champion,

207
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,020
she must have a lot of trophies and plaques, right?

208
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,720
Don't you wanna see them too, Ran?

209
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,220
Well, I suppose so, but...

210
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,620
I'm home!

211
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,020
Oh, my husband's shoes!

212
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,520
It's just 9:30.

213
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,220
I guess he really punctual.

214
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,920
Well, I'll go get my husband.

215
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,420
You can wait in our living room here.

216
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,620
Dear! Lawyer Kisaki is here!

217
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,320
No matter how you look at it, this is something.

218
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,520
Look at the number of these trophies and plaques!

219
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,920
Yeah, I know!

220
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,620
When she was in her prime, she never lost.

221
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,220
She was even said to be invincible!

222
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,520
Say, this picture...

223
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,720
See the tall man standing to the far right?

224
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,920
I think that's the gold medalist that she mentioned earlier.

225
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,620
Right, right. That's Hajime Kajimoto of the 81kg class.

226
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,820
Oh, and the other one, standing to her left.

227
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,420
That's Yuko's husband, Shiro Arisawa.

228
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,720
Then, the boy making the peace sign, is Arisawa's son?

229
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,520
No, that's Kajimoto's son, Kouta!

230
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,720
He would come along to the judo dojo where I worked as a coach.

231
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,120
He is really cute.

232
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,420
And, your husband?

233
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,220
The thing is, I can't find him anywhere.

234
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,520
He's not in the bath or bathroom either.

235
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,820
He might have gone out for cigarettes after getting home.

236
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,220
I'll try to get him on his cell.

237
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,420
A ringtone...

238
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,020
You hear it, too?

239
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,720
Don't cut the phone!

240
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,320
Conan!

241
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,820
Could it be inside this closet?

242
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,920
Dear!

243
00:14:18,622 --> 00:14:22,622
The victim is Shiro Arisawa, age 37.

244
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:26,315
He was a businessman that worked for Haido Co.

245
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:28,915
This is his residence.

246
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:32,215
And Yuko Arisawa.

247
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:35,915
Are you sure he is your husband?

248
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:36,915
Yes, very sure.

249
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:41,215
It appears that some sort of rope was used to strangle him to death.

250
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:44,615
Absolutely. We haven't found the weapon yet.

251
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:47,715
It was likely something along the line of a thin cloth.

252
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:49,415
Like a tie, right?

253
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:50,515
-What? -What?

254
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,615
Because before, on the phone...

255
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:55,015
He said, "I'm at a wake",

256
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:56,815
so shouldn't he have a tie?

257
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:59,615
Usually, when men go to a wake,

258
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:01,715
don't they wear suits with a black tie?

259
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:03,915
That's true.

260
00:15:03,915 --> 00:15:06,015
This raises the possibility of the culprit

261
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:08,715
taking the victim's tie and using it as a weapon.

262
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:11,515
And, do you know whose wake it was?

263
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:13,915
Well, all my husband said on the phone

264
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:17,315
was that someone he knew passed away suddenly.

265
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:22,115
And I think I heard chanting in the background.

266
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:26,115
What? Ran, you spoke with the victim on the phone as well?

267
00:15:26,115 --> 00:15:29,915
No. While I was speaking with my husband on the phone,

268
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:33,415
my fingers slipped and hit the speaker button.

269
00:15:33,415 --> 00:15:35,815
That's why we heard it as well.

270
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:41,215
But why were you and the children with her

271
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:43,215
while she was speaking to the victim?

272
00:15:43,215 --> 00:15:45,215
Actually...

273
00:15:45,215 --> 00:15:49,415
The victim was her husband, Shiro, who had consulted with me

274
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:53,815
on settling a traffic accident in the past.

275
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:59,015
Ever since the accident, he had been plagued by a stalker,

276
00:15:59,015 --> 00:16:01,115
which led her to consulting with me again.

277
00:16:01,115 --> 00:16:02,615
Her husband had been saying that

278
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:05,915
he felt as if "someone was always watching him".

279
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:07,615
But personally,

280
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:10,315
I never felt there was any indication of anything like that

281
00:16:10,315 --> 00:16:14,015
so I had our old lawyer, Ms. Kisaki visit our us.

282
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,915
Since my husband has such great faith in Ms. Kisaki,

283
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:19,515
I thought that, if she could prove

284
00:16:19,515 --> 00:16:24,415
there weren't any wire taps or cameras anywhere,

285
00:16:24,415 --> 00:16:29,415
it might put his mind at rest.

286
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:33,915
Also, prior to leaving Ms. Kisaki's office by car,

287
00:16:33,915 --> 00:16:36,315
as this boy said earlier,

288
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:40,015
my husband told me that he was at a wake.

289
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:41,415
And her husband told her over the phone

290
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:45,415
at time that he would be back around 9:30.

291
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:48,415
Until then, we were at a nearby restaurant,

292
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:51,615
with the children and ate there.

293
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:53,715
Then we came here in her car afterwards.

294
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:55,615
Do you know what time it was?

295
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,815
Let's see, it was...

296
00:16:57,815 --> 00:17:02,515
She called her husband at around 7:30 in the evening,

297
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:05,015
and we went to the hotel immediately.

298
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:09,815
So, by the time we finished our meal and left, it was around 9:00.

299
00:17:09,815 --> 00:17:12,915
When we got here, it was almost exactly 9:30.

300
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:18,915
And then, somehow, you came across the body in the closet?

301
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:22,215
Yeah, since I couldn't find him,

302
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:24,715
I called his cell phone and...

303
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,615
We heard ring tone from the closet.

304
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,015
Which amounts to...

305
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:36,915
Your husband claimed he wouldn't be home until 9:30,

306
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:39,615
but actually arrived thirty minutes early.

307
00:17:39,615 --> 00:17:43,015
His estimated time of death is around 9:00 tonight.

308
00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:45,815
So, at that time, he must have already been home.

309
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:53,215
That means, there's a chance that the stalker is still somewhere nearby.

310
00:17:53,215 --> 00:17:57,015
The culprit had been lying in wait,

311
00:17:57,015 --> 00:18:00,915
for her husband to return.

312
00:18:00,915 --> 00:18:03,315
About your husband's stalker...

313
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,215
Did you have nothing of the situation?

314
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:08,415
No, at all.

315
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:12,415
Not being a fan of hers, it's unlikely that you'll understand.

316
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:13,715
What?

317
00:18:13,715 --> 00:18:16,115
A fan of hers?

318
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:19,015
Oh, don't you recognize her?

319
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:23,815
She is the former All-Japan champion of judo in the 70kg class.

320
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:26,515
This is Yuko Arisawa.

321
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:28,615
It really is her!

322
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:31,415
I thought I'd seen her face somewhere!

323
00:18:31,415 --> 00:18:33,515
Thanks.

324
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:37,715
But it's strange for a guy to be so worried about a stalker

325
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:39,515
when he has such an able-bodied bodyguard like her.

326
00:18:39,515 --> 00:18:41,415
That's true.

327
00:18:41,415 --> 00:18:42,915
After thinking about it,

328
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:45,415
it could be the victim from that traffic accident.

329
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,515
I'm not so sure that's the case.

330
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:51,615
They might have just been after the money.

331
00:18:51,615 --> 00:18:52,915
Conan!

332
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:54,615
Cause look down here!

333
00:18:54,615 --> 00:18:57,215
At this person's left ring finger!

334
00:18:57,215 --> 00:18:59,815
It looks like one was there before.

335
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:01,515
But now there's no ring!

336
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,715
It's true.

337
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:06,315
Isn't the left finger for wedding bands?

338
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:08,915
Did your husband always wear his wedding ring?

339
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,415
Yeah.

340
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:13,515
But that's weird!

341
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:15,415
Even though the ring is gone,

342
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:18,615
this fancy-looking watch is still here!

343
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,415
Why is it?

344
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:25,415
I'm so sorry. I should be keeping a better eye on him.

345
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:28,715
Since it's still here, their motive wasn't money after all, huh?

346
00:19:28,715 --> 00:19:30,415
Guess not.

347
00:19:30,415 --> 00:19:31,715
At any rate,

348
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:34,515
for time being, we'll concentrate on inspecting the house.

349
00:19:34,515 --> 00:19:38,115
While we do, will all of you please wait in another room.

350
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:45,615
To think all of this started while looking into a stalker...

351
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:47,615
I feel sorry for Yuko.

352
00:19:47,615 --> 00:19:49,715
Yes, I guess so.

353
00:19:49,715 --> 00:19:54,015
I don't want to conclude that she planned the murder already.

354
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:55,315
What?

355
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:02,415
Are you trying to say Yuko is the culprit?

356
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:05,515
Yeah, it's certainly a possibility, isn't it?

357
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:09,415
But her husband was killed around 9:00 tonight.

358
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:12,715
That's the same time we left the hotel restaurant.

359
00:20:12,715 --> 00:20:15,915
Wasn't Yuko with us the entire time?

360
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:19,715
But she excused herself to the bathroom once, didn't she?

361
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:21,715
Just before we left the restaurant.

362
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:24,615
But it was only for around ten minutes.

363
00:20:24,615 --> 00:20:27,615
Her husband was at a wake then.

364
00:20:27,615 --> 00:20:29,315
Are you saying that she would tell him to come to the hotel

365
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:30,915
despite knowing what she did?

366
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:32,915
No, that's not it.

367
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:38,015
When Officer Takagi checked the call history on her phone,

368
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:44,015
it said that last call she made was at 7:30, which was from my office.

369
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:48,315
Then, how could Yuko be the culprit?

370
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:52,215
The call from my office could have been fabricated.

371
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:53,415
What?

372
00:20:53,415 --> 00:20:59,015
By then, shouldn't he have already been home, normally?

373
00:20:59,015 --> 00:21:02,915
But this time, when she called her husband,

374
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:05,615
she went for his cell instead of the home phone.

375
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:08,415
Isn't that suspicious?

376
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:11,915
What's more, I think she purposely put it on speaker,

377
00:21:11,915 --> 00:21:14,815
just so we could hear the conversation.

378
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:18,115
What? A wake?

379
00:21:18,115 --> 00:21:21,415
Yeah. Someone I know suddenly passed away.

380
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:24,515
You're thinking about it too much.

381
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:28,715
Because after that, didn't she let you speak to him?

382
00:21:28,715 --> 00:21:31,815
The voice on the phone was that of her husband, right?

383
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:36,115
Yeah. I doubt there was a trick involved there.

384
00:21:36,115 --> 00:21:38,115
That's true.

385
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:41,315
If his voice had been recorded beforehand

386
00:21:41,315 --> 00:21:44,015
and it was just played back over the phone,

387
00:21:44,015 --> 00:21:47,915
she could easily fake a conversation that way.

388
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:50,515
But it would've been 100% impossible

389
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:53,015
to hold a conversation with Ms. Kisaki after that.

390
00:21:53,015 --> 00:21:56,715
Someone could have imitated his voice over the phone.

391
00:21:56,715 --> 00:22:01,915
After meeting with her so many times during the settlement proceedings,

392
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:04,215
she would be hard to fool.

393
00:22:04,215 --> 00:22:08,015
If she really did call her husband then...

394
00:22:09,215 --> 00:22:11,715
I'm at a wake.

395
00:22:11,715 --> 00:22:14,415
You can hear the chanting, can't you?

396
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:18,115
Without knowing where the wake was being held...

397
00:22:18,115 --> 00:22:21,615
Could Arisawa really have planned to murder him?

398
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:49,915
"Next Episode" -Say! Should I give Dad a call?

399
00:23:49,915 --> 00:23:52,915
I'd rather sell my soul to the devil.

400
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:55,115
A devil, huh?

401
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:57,615
-Ron! -Ron?

402
00:23:57,615 --> 00:24:02,215
Sorry! I'm at the table practicing with some of the neighbors.

403
00:24:02,215 --> 00:24:05,715
Yes. I want the culprit

404
00:24:05,715 --> 00:24:08,415
the one who strangled Shiro, your husband to death

405
00:24:08,415 --> 00:24:09,915
to turn himself into the police!

406
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:16,715
Next Conan, "Might Over Mystery (Part 2)"

407
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:29,615
Next Conan's Hint:

408
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:31,715
"The sound of Mahjong."

409
00:24:31,715 --> 00:24:33,615
In the next episode, Dad is really on his toes!

410
00:24:33,615 --> 00:24:35,915
No way! Seriously?

411
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:37,115
Ron!
