1
00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:03,962
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:05,862
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,863 --> 00:00:07,662
The princess and the queen, the two moms.

4
00:00:07,663 --> 00:00:09,562
The key is in Pop's hands.

5
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:11,162
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:13,162
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,163 --> 00:00:15,163
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:56,646 --> 00:01:58,045
Pops is asked to find the person

9
00:01:58,046 --> 00:02:00,145
who is after the life of Mr. Mikio Fujieda

10
00:02:00,146 --> 00:02:02,745
for a fee of 10 million yen.

11
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:04,545
He thinks this is an easy case

12
00:02:04,546 --> 00:02:06,945
and holds a celebration party in advance, only to spend a lot of money.

13
00:02:06,946 --> 00:02:08,845
He couldn't close the case, however,

14
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:10,645
and he is in debt of about 8 million yen.

15
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:12,746
He is shocked and takes to his bed.

16
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:15,945
Acting on behalf of pops,

17
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:18,745
Ran's mom goes to the client's place.

18
00:02:18,746 --> 00:02:21,646
There, she happens to meet my mom.

19
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:29,646
And then, Mr. Mikio Fujieda is killed in a closed room.

20
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:39,646
"Two Princesses of a Kind (Part 2)"

21
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:48,445
Well, well. It's Eri.

22
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:50,445
And Yukiko, too.

23
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:54,845
What's the matter with you two?

24
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:55,945
I'm here for...

25
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:59,645
I'm here on behalf of my husband.

26
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:04,345
He got a request for finding a person living on the premises

27
00:03:04,346 --> 00:03:07,646
that is after the life of Mr. Mikio Fujieda.

28
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:10,945
But how did he know

29
00:03:10,946 --> 00:03:14,245
that the person is among the people on the premises?

30
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:17,845
These were placed under the pillow of Mr. Mikio Fujieda.

31
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:22,245
"Watch behind you! I'll send you to heaven."

32
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:24,845
So was this used bullet.

33
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:25,945
Who could have done a thing like that

34
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:28,545
except someone living in the house?

35
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:30,345
You could be right.

36
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:33,845
-The crime took place at about... -Hey.

37
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,945
-Wasn't it about 8 pm? -Yes.

38
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:38,945
It's when all of us were watching

39
00:03:38,946 --> 00:03:41,245
the display of the surveillance camera.

40
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:42,545
I see.

41
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:46,145
Then suddenly, Mr. Fujieda stood up holding his hands up,

42
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:48,745
was shot and fell down to the floor.

43
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:50,745
We hurried to the room

44
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:53,345
and heard two gun shots from inside the room.

45
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:56,445
We broke the door, went inside the room,

46
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:58,846
and found this.

47
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:03,345
Inspector Megure!

48
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:05,645
We found the gun, sir.

49
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,045
Good!

50
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:10,245
The gun is a Colt Compact 45 automatic.

51
00:04:10,246 --> 00:04:12,245
There were three cartridges beside the gun

52
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:14,845
and the number of cartridges coincides with the number of bullet wounds.

53
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:18,745
It seems that the culprit shot across this window

54
00:04:18,746 --> 00:04:20,945
and hurried out of this place.

55
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:24,145
Then we have to consider the possibility of a culprit from outside.

56
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:25,445
But what is this?

57
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:27,545
This towel with a burn on it.

58
00:04:27,546 --> 00:04:28,745
It is probably...

59
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:30,445
It was probably burnt when the culprit

60
00:04:30,446 --> 00:04:32,145
wrapped the towel around the gun when firing,

61
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,645
and tried to hide the powder traces.

62
00:04:33,646 --> 00:04:37,345
Or tried to muffle the gun shot but failed.

63
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:39,645
-Hey, ladies. -Officer Chiba, you go and find out

64
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,345
where and how the gun was obtained.

65
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:42,346
Yes.

66
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:44,445
Officer Takagi, you go and find out

67
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:46,145
if any suspicious person was around or seen.

68
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:47,245
Yes.

69
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,545
Hey, wait a minute.

70
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:50,245
And by the way...

71
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:53,145
Check the bullets in the body

72
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:56,645
against the bullet left under the pillow, please.

73
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:59,145
Now, Inspector, bring the lab people

74
00:04:59,146 --> 00:05:01,545
and come with me to the living room.

75
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:05,245
We'll check the gun powder traces on all the people in the house,

76
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:06,445
and start questioning them.

77
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:08,445
Hey, Eri.

78
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:10,645
Come on, Inspector. Eri is trying her best.

79
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:14,845
-But... -For her, 10 million yen is at stake.

80
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,146
What?

81
00:05:16,646 --> 00:05:18,545
Hey!

82
00:05:18,546 --> 00:05:20,645
I wanna go to the toilet.

83
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:22,645
I need to...

84
00:05:22,646 --> 00:05:24,246
Toilet!

85
00:05:26,746 --> 00:05:30,645
Then, one by one, let's have each of you talk to the Inspector.

86
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:33,045
After Mikio was shot in the audio room,

87
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:36,545
for about 3 minutes until we found the dead body,

88
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:39,145
where were you all, and what were you all doing.

89
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:42,645
I went to my room to get the key

90
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:45,045
and ran to the audio room.

91
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:49,945
I called the police and an ambulance on the phone in my room

92
00:05:49,946 --> 00:05:52,946
and I stayed in my room.

93
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:57,245
But you knew your husband was shot?

94
00:05:57,246 --> 00:06:01,045
Still, there could be a man with a gun around!

95
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:02,445
Could be.

96
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,245
Besides, you know I was watching Mikio get shot and go down

97
00:06:05,246 --> 00:06:08,545
on the display with the butler and the others?

98
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:10,545
If you must suspect someone, you can pick on Shigeru

99
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:13,745
because he went out of the monitoring room just before Mikio went down.

100
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:15,645
Did you leave?

101
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:16,646
I did.

102
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:20,445
I had to write the manuscript I was working on in my room.

103
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,245
But I stopped writing

104
00:06:22,246 --> 00:06:25,046
and joined Eri and the others to go up to the audio room.

105
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:29,945
I heard the two gun shots in front of the room.

106
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:32,345
So I couldn't have possibly done it.

107
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:37,245
Did you hear any suspicious sound or something?

108
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:42,146
No. The sound of the classical music was so loud.

109
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:44,745
Excuse me, Inspector,

110
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:46,545
but do you mind if I sit down?

111
00:06:46,546 --> 00:06:48,545
Of course not.

112
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:51,245
You can sit down, Mr. Ueki and everybody else.

113
00:06:51,246 --> 00:06:55,045
I'd prefer to keep standing. It's easier on me.

114
00:06:55,046 --> 00:06:56,145
Inspector Megure!

115
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:59,245
I caught a man loitering around the garden, sir.

116
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:01,245
-You did? -Hey! Come on up quick.

117
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:03,345
Oh, he is...

118
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:05,446
He is Mr. Doi, the gardener.

119
00:07:06,246 --> 00:07:09,145
Gardener, is he?

120
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:10,745
He's been like this, sir.

121
00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:13,045
He doesn't say anything, doesn't answer me.

122
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:17,145
Mr. Doi was at a place in the garden not very far from the audio room,

123
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:21,345
for at least 3 minutes after Mr. Fujieda was shot at 8 o'clock.

124
00:07:21,346 --> 00:07:24,545
Mr. Doi was seen in the surveillance camera and on the display.

125
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:26,745
He was absorbed in gardening even after the incident

126
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,045
and just didn't come here.

127
00:07:29,046 --> 00:07:31,945
Seeing is believing, they say.

128
00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:33,445
Would you care to go

129
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:35,645
and take a look at the video of the surveillance camera?

130
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:37,945
I see.

131
00:07:37,946 --> 00:07:40,646
He seems to be in the garden when he was shot.

132
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:44,945
But he disappeared right after it.

133
00:07:44,946 --> 00:07:48,045
But the light is seen on the screen.

134
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:52,645
The light is flickering, and that means he is there.

135
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:56,545
But if there were cameras in all of the rooms,

136
00:07:56,546 --> 00:07:59,345
we would be able to tell when, where, and who did what.

137
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,745
I wish we knew.

138
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,445
But these pictures tell you enough, don't they?

139
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:05,545
The chance of an outsider is breaking in is slight,

140
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:06,945
and the possibility that the crime was committed by an insider

141
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:08,445
is more likely.

142
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,446
How come?

143
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,045
There are so many cameras around,

144
00:08:12,046 --> 00:08:15,245
but there is no picture of a suspicious person on any of them.

145
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:16,645
The crime was committed by a person

146
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:21,045
who knows precisely where the cameras are located, see?

147
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:23,145
I see.

148
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:26,145
So, we have four suspects to go.

149
00:08:26,146 --> 00:08:27,146
When they commit the crime,

150
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:30,945
it seems that two of them are always together.

151
00:08:30,946 --> 00:08:33,745
How about going after their motives?

152
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:37,045
Conan, you are very quiet today.

153
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:39,146
You usually get all excited over a case. What's come over you?

154
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:43,845
The two of them say so much

155
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:46,045
that there's not much left for me to say.

156
00:08:46,046 --> 00:08:49,145
But this is a strange case.

157
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:52,645
The butler and Motoka were with us watching the display

158
00:08:52,646 --> 00:08:54,545
when the first shot was fired.

159
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:57,445
But they have no alibi for the second and third shots.

160
00:08:57,446 --> 00:09:01,345
Mr. Doi was not seen after the first shot except for the light.

161
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:04,045
Shigeru Fujieda has no alibi for the first shot,

162
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:06,746
but he was with us at the second shot.

163
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:10,845
This means, if the displayed image of the surveillance camera is a trick,

164
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:13,945
or if the second and third shots were part of a trick,

165
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:16,645
their alibis won't stand.

166
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:19,145
Two things worry me.

167
00:09:19,146 --> 00:09:20,845
One is that the second shot

168
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:23,345
and the third shot were about 3 minutes apart,

169
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:26,546
and the other is that he inserted a bookmark into the book he was reading.

170
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:29,745
If he was being threatened with a gun pointed at him,

171
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:31,346
why did he do such a thing?

172
00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:35,445
Who resented him?

173
00:09:35,446 --> 00:09:37,445
Of the four people?

174
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:39,145
Yes.

175
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,745
Mr. Ueki, the butler, for sure.

176
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:44,245
He was ordered to clean the storage that was full of dust,

177
00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:46,646
and he had a relapse of asthma.

178
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:51,945
But if I were Shigeru, I would've got angry.

179
00:09:51,946 --> 00:09:55,145
I know the Master inherited this residence

180
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:58,645
but Shigeru has been living in this house since his childhood,

181
00:09:58,646 --> 00:10:01,945
yet now he has to pay rent because he was told to pay.

182
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:05,545
The young mistress had no grudge on Master, I suppose,

183
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:08,845
but it's so obvious that she married for the inheritance.

184
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:13,445
I wouldn't be surprised if she is overjoyed about the master's death.

185
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,645
You could be right.

186
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:18,245
Mr. Doi, the gardener glared at the young Mistress the other day.

187
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:19,445
Of course, he would.

188
00:10:19,446 --> 00:10:21,245
When she learned the master was going to rebuild this house,

189
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,045
she asked him to break down the garden

190
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:25,346
and turn it into a swimming pool.

191
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:28,846
What are you doing up there?

192
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:32,645
Excuse me, but the late Mistress cared much for the garden.

193
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:35,845
It has been most dear to her.

194
00:10:35,846 --> 00:10:36,846
But...

195
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:38,945
That's enough. Leave right this minute.

196
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:40,146
Yes, sir.

197
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:45,545
Excuse me, but are you from Kouchi, Mr. Doi?

198
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:46,546
What?

199
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:49,145
I've been in Takajou town.

200
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:52,045
In Takajou town! What a coincidence.

201
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:53,745
I'm from Kami town.

202
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:55,745
Wow, from Kami!

203
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:59,445
When I was a small fry, I used to swim in the Kagami River.

204
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:00,745
You did, ma gal!

205
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:04,145
That river was the prettiest,

206
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:05,745
and that famous Ryoma Sakamoto

207
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:08,045
learned swimming in dat river, did ya know?

208
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:09,445
Is that Kouchi accent?

209
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:12,445
I wonder if Yukiko was born in Kouchi?

210
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:14,545
No. When she was an actress,

211
00:11:14,546 --> 00:11:16,645
she played a role in Kouchi accent.

212
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:18,945
She learned the accent then.

213
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:22,445
She is a genius in playing and applying things like this.

214
00:11:22,446 --> 00:11:24,546
That's what Shinichi used to tell me.

215
00:11:25,746 --> 00:11:27,945
Is that so?

216
00:11:27,946 --> 00:11:29,445
Good news?

217
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:34,345
Yes. He told me a very interesting thing.

218
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:35,945
He heard the gunshot several seconds

219
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:39,245
after he heard the glass crack.

220
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:41,145
What?

221
00:11:41,146 --> 00:11:42,345
What does that mean?

222
00:11:42,346 --> 00:11:45,545
Usually, the glass will crack at the same time as the gunshot?

223
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:46,546
I don't know.

224
00:11:46,547 --> 00:11:49,345
The glass was cracked with a gun then the shot was fired?

225
00:11:49,346 --> 00:11:51,445
But it bothers me, the sound of the cracked glass.

226
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:54,945
Naturally, it was before the first gunshot was heard, wasn't it?

227
00:11:54,946 --> 00:11:59,245
He doesn't remember how many shots he heard.

228
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:00,945
He thought some naughty kids in the neighborhood

229
00:12:00,946 --> 00:12:03,745
were making noise out of bamboo fireworks or something,

230
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:05,945
so he didn't care much about it.

231
00:12:05,946 --> 00:12:09,845
I wonder it may have something to do with the hint Yusaku gave me.

232
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:11,945
Did you call your husband?

233
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:13,645
Yes, I did just a moment ago.

234
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:15,445
When I told him about the case,

235
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:19,045
he chuckled and told me.

236
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:23,445
He says, "Wrong road sign. Tell her that."

237
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:25,545
Tell her? Tell who?

238
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:27,045
Huh?

239
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,045
Of course, to you.

240
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:30,945
Oh, to me.

241
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:33,745
Should I be overjoyed?

242
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:35,245
Of course not.

243
00:12:35,246 --> 00:12:37,446
I thought so.

244
00:12:47,147 --> 00:12:48,946
Excuse me, Inspector,

245
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:51,546
but didn't you investigate enough already?

246
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:52,946
And besides, now you know it's impossible for us

247
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:54,447
to have committed the crime.

248
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:57,546
Inspector.

249
00:12:57,547 --> 00:13:02,046
The neighbors say they have not seen any suspicious person.

250
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,246
I see.

251
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:06,946
And we don't know how the gun was obtained,

252
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:09,046
but the bullets used in the murder

253
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:13,546
were identical to the bullet that was used for making threats.

254
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:16,446
But there is one strange thing.

255
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:19,746
One of the bullets extracted out of the body

256
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:22,046
shows a streak on the surface of the bullet.

257
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,846
What does that mean?

258
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:25,247
Now I see.

259
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:29,646
-What? -Don't what me!

260
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:32,046
You look as if you alone know it all already.

261
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:34,246
Who cares because I do know it all.

262
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,146
Well, then, tell me all about it, Shinichi, dear.

263
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:39,446
Don't you call yourself the Night Baroness

264
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:42,246
and start a flashy action scene again, mom.

265
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:43,546
Don't worry. It's all right.

266
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:46,047
Tonight, I'll be cool and collected with no-frills action.

267
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:49,046
People!

268
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:51,746
It's past eleven o'clock already!

269
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,546
Will you do the rest of it tomorrow?

270
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:55,846
We are still investigating.

271
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:57,446
Investigating?

272
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:59,246
You have done all the investigating already and finished it!

273
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:00,747
I don't like to be deceived!

274
00:14:01,947 --> 00:14:05,446
Yes, we have been deceived by the culprit.

275
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:09,146
It was made to look as if Mr. Mikio Fujieda was threatened

276
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:11,946
with a gun from outside the window and shot.

277
00:14:11,947 --> 00:14:16,347
But the culprit couldn't deceive the eyes of the detective.

278
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:25,746
Can't deceive the private eyes of this Baroness of Night!

279
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:29,247
Hey. Where did she get those lights?

280
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:32,446
Are you saying that...

281
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,246
You found out who the culprit is?

282
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:36,246
I surely did.

283
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:39,646
But how did the culprit deceive you?

284
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:43,046
The surveillance camera?

285
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:46,746
We have been deceived a lot earlier than that.

286
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:50,446
The culprit has already deceived us into thinking wrong

287
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:53,946
by showing us the two memo sheets and the used bullet.

288
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:57,146
The culprit put up a deceiving road sign

289
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,546
to make us think he was going to shoot a gun.

290
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:03,646
But Mr. Mikio was actually shot with a gun.

291
00:15:03,647 --> 00:15:06,046
Did you notice, Inspector Megure?

292
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:09,846
Mikio was reading a book just before he was shot,

293
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:13,346
and he placed a bookmark into the book.

294
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,546
Yes, I remember.

295
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,446
Usually, you put a bookmark between the pages

296
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:18,646
when you finish reading the page,

297
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:23,546
not when you are threatened with a gun pointed at you.

298
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,046
You are right.

299
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:26,946
What would you do, Inspector,

300
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:29,746
if you finished reading a book and wanted to take a rest?

301
00:15:29,747 --> 00:15:33,246
I'd turn my head or rub my shoulders.

302
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:35,547
Or stretch out and...

303
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:41,546
That's right. He just stood up and stretched.

304
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:42,547
Don't be a fool.

305
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:44,846
Right after that, Mikio fell to the floor, didn't he?

306
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:46,846
You don't go down right after stretching.

307
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:50,146
It's not the stretching that did it. Standing up did it.

308
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:52,546
It's rare, but some people stand up quickly

309
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:54,846
and feel faint or fall down.

310
00:15:54,847 --> 00:15:58,446
But how could he have fainted at such convenient timing?

311
00:15:58,447 --> 00:16:00,846
There is a drug that does it.

312
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:06,446
The name of the chemical is isop... isopro... isope?

313
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:08,446
Isoprotelenol, it is.

314
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,246
It is used for inducing faintness.

315
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:14,146
It is given to patients who have a tendency to faint easily,

316
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:15,946
and it's used for inducing feeling faint.

317
00:16:15,947 --> 00:16:18,246
They are trying to find out what causes fainting.

318
00:16:18,247 --> 00:16:21,146
I see. That drug made him faint

319
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,146
and made us believe that he held at gun point then shot.

320
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:25,746
Is that right?

321
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:27,446
Yes. What I wanted to say is that

322
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:29,846
he was not yet shot at that time.

323
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:33,446
But the culprit thought that it was not sufficient to fool us,

324
00:16:33,447 --> 00:16:38,846
so added a word to make sure to mislead us.

325
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:41,246
He said, "The master is holding his hands up."

326
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:43,946
What? Don't tell me...

327
00:16:43,947 --> 00:16:46,446
He had us taken in good.

328
00:16:46,447 --> 00:16:47,546
Yeah.

329
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:49,046
You did really well, didn't you?

330
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:51,446
Mr. Souhachi Ueki, the butler.

331
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:53,146
Mr. Ueki knew well

332
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:55,746
that Mr. Fujieda drinks coffee while he reads a book.

333
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:59,746
And he stands up and stretches after reading.

334
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:01,846
This chemical is good for asthma

335
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:03,946
when you take a moderate amount of it.

336
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:07,346
Well, he made an alibi for himself

337
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:10,046
and then pretended to go and get the key to the audio room,

338
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:12,246
but he actually went to the room from outside,

339
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:17,146
and shot three bullets into Mr. Fujieda who was passed out,

340
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:19,046
to murder him.

341
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:23,046
But you heard two shots, didn't you?

342
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:26,346
Yukiko asked Mr. Doi and learned so a while ago.

343
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:28,846
Several seconds after the sound of the glass cracking,

344
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,846
he heard the shots.

345
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:36,046
And there was the loud sound of classical music played.

346
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:38,446
You understand, don't you?

347
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:39,946
I see.

348
00:17:39,947 --> 00:17:41,846
It's a silencer!

349
00:17:41,847 --> 00:17:44,646
He put a silencer on when he fired the first shot

350
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,846
so only the sound of glass cracking was heard.

351
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:52,746
And the silencer left a streak on the surface of the bullet.

352
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:57,246
Then he used a towel to hide the traces of gun powder.

353
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,646
Anyway, go find the silencer.

354
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:01,446
You don't need to.

355
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:05,146
Because the butler must still have it.

356
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:06,746
Probably in one of his socks.

357
00:18:06,747 --> 00:18:07,747
What?

358
00:18:07,748 --> 00:18:09,846
Excuse me.

359
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:13,146
Inspector! I've found it, the silencer!

360
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:18,246
He hesitated to sit down, so it dawned on me.

361
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:20,246
Sitting down will make the hem of his pants go up

362
00:18:20,247 --> 00:18:23,946
and it may show what he had concealed.

363
00:18:23,947 --> 00:18:27,146
Hey. You have burn marks!

364
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,446
I can withstand the burn, sir.

365
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:32,946
It's nothing, if I can keep the garden for the late Mistress.

366
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:35,546
-The garden, you say? -Yes, sir.

367
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,446
The garden of the premises has been carefully maintained

368
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:42,146
since the madam was a little child.

369
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:46,147
I feel she is somewhere here with me.

370
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:51,646
I cannot forgive the master, who is a perfect stranger to the house,

371
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,347
to have everything done his own way.

372
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:55,846
Gosh!

373
00:18:55,847 --> 00:18:58,346
So, it's you. You're the culprit.

374
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:02,146
All this time, I thought it was his brother, Shigeru.

375
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:04,747
Now, my share of inheritance has decreased.

376
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:09,446
I hired a detective to get something on him,

377
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:10,846
but I made a big mistake!

378
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:11,946
Listen.

379
00:19:11,947 --> 00:19:16,246
If Mr. Mikio Fujieda had no parents, brothers or sisters,

380
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:17,946
you would've gotten the entire share of inheritance.

381
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:20,746
No share goes to the brothers of a former wife.

382
00:19:20,747 --> 00:19:21,946
Really?

383
00:19:21,947 --> 00:19:24,246
Why, I got it all wrong!

384
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,847
But this is only if Mr. Fujieda left no will behind.

385
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:31,246
Anyway, I must ask for the amount of 10 million yen

386
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:33,346
for finding the culprit.

387
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:34,746
What? How can you?

388
00:19:34,747 --> 00:19:37,146
Mikio got killed already!

389
00:19:37,147 --> 00:19:38,446
The contract says

390
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:41,746
nothing about protecting Mr. Fujieda's life, as you can see.

391
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,347
See? Your signature and seal are here.

392
00:19:46,147 --> 00:19:47,446
Okay.

393
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:50,846
With Mikio's inheritance, 10 million yen is small money.

394
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:53,646
I might add that until the inheritance is settled and finalized,

395
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:56,546
all the assets in the name of Mr. Fujieda's will be frozen,

396
00:19:56,547 --> 00:19:59,947
so please pay me out of your private account.

397
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:02,046
I don't believe it!

398
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:03,646
You'd better. If you refuse to pay,

399
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:07,346
I will execute it by law to attach your property.

400
00:20:07,347 --> 00:20:09,047
You understand, I hope?

401
00:20:10,847 --> 00:20:12,846
Well, so it goes.

402
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:16,446
Afterwards, Mikio Fujieda's will was publicized as follows.

403
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:18,746
It said, "No inheritance will go to

404
00:20:18,747 --> 00:20:20,446
those who were not able to protect my life.

405
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:22,346
The entire estate shall be donated to the country."

406
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:25,047
This has been carried out to the letter.

407
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:53,646
"Mouri Detective Agency" -The next day.

408
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:54,946
Here you are, dear.

409
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,546
After deducting your debt,

410
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:58,646
it comes down to one million and 943 thousand yen.

411
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:00,547
Now, you can thank me.

412
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:03,946
Don't you smell something?

413
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,946
Do you keep a pet or something?

414
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:10,947
A client of mine came this morning with a dog, and it did it.

415
00:22:14,347 --> 00:22:17,946
By the way, it's been a long time, Yukiko.

416
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:21,446
Yeah. There's something that I want to ask you, Kogoro.

417
00:22:21,447 --> 00:22:23,246
Hey, Eri. Come on and ask him.

418
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:26,746
No. You're the one who wanted to ask.

419
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:28,646
They want to know which one you chose

420
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:32,347
for the Miss Teitan High School Contest.

421
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:36,746
You mean the one that took place 20 years ago.

422
00:22:36,747 --> 00:22:38,446
It's probably Eri

423
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:40,546
because they were in love with each other.

424
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:42,146
Surely it's Yukiko.

425
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:45,346
She was unbelievably beautiful, then.

426
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:48,146
It must be Eri, if I remember right.

427
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:49,647
Dear.

428
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:54,746
I was very ignorant of those festivities at that time

429
00:22:54,747 --> 00:22:57,546
so I took the word "Miss" Teitan to mean mistake

430
00:22:57,547 --> 00:23:00,946
and wrote the name of the one who I thought was a klutz.

431
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,046
What?

432
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,746
Then, if you knew what it really meant,

433
00:23:03,747 --> 00:23:05,746
which one would you have chosen?

434
00:23:05,747 --> 00:23:07,146
Of course, it's Yukiko.

435
00:23:07,147 --> 00:23:10,847
You don't have to ask me. She was utterly beautiful.

436
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:17,847
No! Eri was pretty, too, for a smart girl!

437
00:23:19,747 --> 00:23:21,546
I'd like to tell you.

438
00:23:21,547 --> 00:23:23,646
For the work Yukiko and I did for you this time,

439
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:27,147
we'll take 10 percent of the total, which is 1 million yen.

440
00:23:28,247 --> 00:23:31,746
And for us, I have to get paid for the bills at the bars,

441
00:23:31,747 --> 00:23:33,846
and be reimbursed for dad's advance allowance,

442
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,646
and the living expenses for this month and next month.

443
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:38,846
And laundering dad's pants.

444
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:40,446
Here is your change.

445
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:42,446
Hey.

446
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:46,046
It's only 4,382 yen in all.

447
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:49,346
Well, let's go out and have something delicious, Yuki.

448
00:23:49,347 --> 00:23:50,847
Let's go, Eri.

449
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,347
Hey!

450
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:57,646
And which one won the contest?

451
00:23:57,647 --> 00:23:59,147
It's marginal.

452
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:03,847
"Next Episode"

453
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:11,946
They were tailing us for quite some time.

454
00:24:11,947 --> 00:24:13,346
Right, I thought so, too.

455
00:24:13,347 --> 00:24:18,046
So, I was planning to take off as soon as the light turned red.

456
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,547
I wonder who they are?

457
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:30,747
