1
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:02,264
Due to a misunderstanding,

2
00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:06,315
Kyogoku-san accidentally knocked out a stuntman filming a TV drama.

3
00:00:07,145 --> 00:00:11,865
He was recruited to fill in for the stuntman, but...

4
00:00:13,235 --> 00:00:17,985
While filming, actor Tokuzono-san fell to his death.

5
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:21,735
The police arrived, and as their investigation progressed...

6
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:27,625
Odori Daisaku (48) Assistant Director

7
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:32,054
Sorry.

8
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:34,965
This is an inappropriate time for me to laugh about the past.

9
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:40,114
Only four people besides Ran-san's group are visible.

10
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:42,644
And we can't see the fourth floor.

11
00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:44,355
Odori Daisaku Found the culprit [music]

12
00:00:57,915 --> 00:00:59,694
Find the question that solves the mystery!

13
00:00:59,695 --> 00:01:01,974
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

14
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:04,074
Sera relentlessly pursues the truth!

15
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:06,154
Three high school girls demonstrate their mystery-solving skills!

16
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:07,774
Always determining the one truth

17
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:09,584
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

18
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:12,085
his name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:57,905
Kyogoku Makoto the Understudy (Part Three)

20
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:04,084
And if we can't figure that out, we can't make any progress.

21
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:05,255
Right, Conan-kun?

22
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:09,844
Rather, Kudo Shinichi-kun?

23
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:11,545
Well, yeah.

24
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:23,175
Wh-What are you talking about?

25
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:25,225
D-Don't tease me.

26
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:27,104
Look closely.

27
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:28,895
See? I'm a child.

28
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:34,314
Shinichi-niichan is a high school student, so he's tall.

29
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:37,395
But I'm this short. Really, really short.

30
00:03:40,435 --> 00:03:44,025
Yeah, that's what an ordinary person would think.

31
00:03:47,015 --> 00:03:51,675
But my mom went to see my dad in London,

32
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:58,095
and I saw her return as a young girl.

33
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:03,055
And I believed the key to solving that mystery

34
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:06,315
was this boy who caught my eye.

35
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:09,555
I'm Holmes' apprentice.

36
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:15,225
If you refuse to admit it, then it can't be helped.

37
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:18,814
I'll go talk to the girls again.

38
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,735
Huh? What?

39
00:04:19,736 --> 00:04:21,525
Hey, wait.

40
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:31,955
Is there a kid who hangs out with Conan-kun who seems mature for their age?

41
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,844
There is one.

42
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:38,125
They're even more mature than we are.

43
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:41,975
What's their name?

44
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:43,974
It's M-Mitsuhiko.

45
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:44,755
What?

46
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:50,765
Mitsuhiko knows a lot for a first-year grade school student.

47
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:53,244
That boy with the freckles?

48
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:56,645
He certainly seems smart, but he's not as smart as you, is he?

49
00:04:57,925 --> 00:04:59,065
Conan-kun.

50
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:00,934
Do you have a minute?

51
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:01,655
Huh?

52
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:06,485
You were nearby when Odori-san was poisoned and collapsed, right?

53
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:07,834
Yeah.

54
00:05:07,835 --> 00:05:11,115
Could you give the Inspector a detailed account of the incident?

55
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:12,705
What? Right now?

56
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:13,865
Yeah.

57
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:18,804
He wants to confirm if Odori-san poisoned himself.

58
00:05:18,805 --> 00:05:20,045
What? Um...

59
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:24,975
I'm kind of, uh...

60
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:27,064
I'm in a tough spot right now.

61
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:27,465
What?

62
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:30,924
And besides, I don't know that I'd be useful.

63
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:32,304
There you go again.

64
00:05:32,305 --> 00:05:34,484
You're not acting like your usual self.

65
00:05:34,485 --> 00:05:35,325
Gotcha.

66
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:36,335
Hey, wait.

67
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:38,174
I'm borrowing him for a bit.

68
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,855
You can do it, Conan-kun.

69
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:42,504
Come on, stop struggling.

70
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:47,615
So, do you know any other kinds who are strangely mature for their age?

71
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:50,984
It's got to be Ai-chan, right?

72
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:53,115
Yeah, Haibara Ai.

73
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:56,074
She lives at Professor Agasa's house.

74
00:05:56,075 --> 00:05:58,244
She's more than just mature.

75
00:05:58,245 --> 00:06:00,125
She's got a totally cool personality.

76
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:02,185
Haibara Ai.

77
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:05,755
She's the girl I met on the Bell Tree Express.

78
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:10,874
What's going on?

79
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:15,394
First Mitsuhiko-kun was sneezing earlier, and now you're sneezing, Ai-kun?

80
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:17,404
Are you okay, Ai-chan?

81
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:20,044
Yeah. I just felt a chill.

82
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:22,334
Maybe someone's talking about you.

83
00:06:22,335 --> 00:06:23,724
It's probably a cold.

84
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:25,404
That's not good.

85
00:06:25,405 --> 00:06:27,905
I'll get you some cold medicine. Wait here.

86
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:33,505
I'm next.

87
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,165
I wish I could've gone to see a movie with Conan-kun, too.

88
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:41,424
The Azengers, right?

89
00:06:41,425 --> 00:06:44,465
Apparently Kamen Yaiba is teaming up with them.

90
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:49,374
Sonoko-san was going on a date at the same time, so it couldn't be helped.

91
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,345
Apparently that cool girl went with them.

92
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:54,814
Sera Masumi-san, right?

93
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:58,605
She seems kind of similar to Ai-chan.

94
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:01,654
Maybe I'm the only one who thinks that.

95
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,235
Who knows?

96
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:05,855
I found it.

97
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:07,984
It's the cold medicine.

98
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:09,485
Now this is no good.

99
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:12,745
It's way past the expiration date.

100
00:07:13,135 --> 00:07:14,994
Shirohato Pharmaceutical Company, huh?

101
00:07:14,995 --> 00:07:16,864
No wonder it's old.

102
00:07:16,865 --> 00:07:18,934
Shirohato Pharmaceutical Company?

103
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:20,734
I've never heard of them.

104
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:26,175
They used to be famous for their cheap but effective medicines.

105
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:29,714
They were a pretty big company, too,

106
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:33,175
but for some reason they suddenly went under.

107
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:36,055
They went bankrupt 25 years ago.

108
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:36,925
What?

109
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:41,314
It happened because a larger company attempted to acquire them,

110
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:43,185
but it didn't go well.

111
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:45,304
Y-You know a lot about them.

112
00:07:45,305 --> 00:07:47,815
Yeah, after all,

113
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:51,884
30 years ago, my father worked as a member

114
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:55,345
of that pharmaceutical company's R&D team.

115
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:03,345
But the company went bankrupt, and my parents were forced to become GPs instead.

116
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:06,674
Since they were renting out their old home to an acquaintance,

117
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:09,305
they opened a small clinic elsewhere.

118
00:08:09,835 --> 00:08:14,595
That same group kept trying to recruit them even after they became GPs.

119
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:17,504
My father kept turning down their offers,

120
00:08:17,505 --> 00:08:20,395
but something made them join their lab.

121
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:23,944
This isn't very interesting, is it?

122
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:25,135
Could you forget what I said?

123
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:27,855
I'm actually curious to know what happened next.

124
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,534
My late sister told me about it.

125
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:32,585
I don't know anymore either.

126
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:36,505
There's no way I could ever tell them.

127
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:42,625
At that lab, my parents were forced to create the drug

128
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:47,375
that turned Kudo-kun and I into children.

129
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:55,595
How many times do I have to tell you?

130
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:58,234
The director just handed him his shake.

131
00:08:58,235 --> 00:09:00,765
The two didn't talk much.

132
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:06,334
They intended to discuss who'd fill in for Tokuzono-san,

133
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:09,825
but because I interrupted them, they tabled the discussion.

134
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:12,264
Damn it.

135
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:16,405
I need to keep an eye on them so Sera doesn't ask any weird questions.

136
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:20,704
Did he hand him any food, like a snack?

137
00:09:20,705 --> 00:09:23,325
He was walking around with ramune candies.

138
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,634
He didn't hand him anything.

139
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:28,795
Odori-san received a message on his phone, though.

140
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:33,215
What? But there wasn't a phone among Odori-san's belongings.

141
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:35,465
That's right.

142
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:41,494
But I'm pretty sure the footage of Tokuzono-san's fall captured Odori-san holding a phone.

143
00:09:41,495 --> 00:09:43,054
Check the footage again.

144
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:44,035
Yes, sir.

145
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:52,735
Hey, we're not ready ye—

146
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:57,445
See? Odori-san is holding a phone.

147
00:09:57,685 --> 00:09:58,395
Huh?

148
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:01,354
Did you notice something, Conan-kun?

149
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:02,924
Y-Yeah.

150
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:05,955
Hold on. I'll write it down.

151
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:09,205
Huh?

152
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:12,335
I left the cap off, so it won't write anymore.

153
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:21,965
I see. It's the cap.

154
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,085
Your car is ready, Jinmei-san.

155
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:37,574
Thanks.

156
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:38,664
Sir.

157
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:39,505
Yeah.

158
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,755
Officers, would it be all right if we left?

159
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:49,015
Tokuzono-chan fell from the fourth floor because of a practical joke device.

160
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:51,264
Odori-kun pranked him.

161
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:52,895
In other words, it was an accident.

162
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:57,775
His light-hearted joke caused an unexpected accident.

163
00:10:57,995 --> 00:11:02,594
Since poison wasn't found in Odori-san's shake or cup,

164
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,475
he must have poisoned himself, right?

165
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:08,125
He felt responsible for the accident and committed suicide.

166
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:10,075
Right?

167
00:11:10,076 --> 00:11:12,864
You won't find anything by keeping us here any longer,

168
00:11:12,865 --> 00:11:17,035
and Hideka-chan and I need to head to my gravure shoot.

169
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:18,245
No.

170
00:11:18,246 --> 00:11:20,655
If they're allowed to leave, they'll destroy the evidence.

171
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:27,175
But Sera's more interested in investigating me than solving the case.

172
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:28,925
I don't have a choice.

173
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:33,475
Sonoko-neechan, I need to talk to you.

174
00:11:35,215 --> 00:11:37,334
What is it, kid?

175
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:40,435
Who's Kyogoku-no-niichan's manager?

176
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:41,565
What?

177
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:47,854
Apparently a TV station producer wants to talk to him about his acting debut.

178
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:48,865
Really?

179
00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:50,045
Yeah.

180
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:52,414
He's waiting behind that car.

181
00:11:52,415 --> 00:11:53,624
Got it.

182
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,225
I'll go hear what he has to say.

183
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:01,875
Huh?

184
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:14,265
Looks like I don't have a choice.

185
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:24,275
Sera-chan seems distracted, so why don't I solve this serial murder case instead?

186
00:12:24,435 --> 00:12:27,324
Yes! It's Sonoko the Detective Queen!

187
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:29,175
Detective Queen?

188
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:33,194
I see.

189
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:36,535
When Detective Mori isn't around, he uses her.

190
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:37,855
Makoto-san.

191
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:42,625
Could you keep people away from me so they can't interfere with my deduction?

192
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:43,895
Got it.

193
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,704
Excuse me.

194
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:46,835
What? Hey, wait.

195
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:48,715
Serial murder?

196
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:50,215
What do you mean?

197
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:55,475
First, there's actor Tokuzono-san's fall to his death.

198
00:12:55,995 --> 00:13:01,025
Everyone gathered to film the action scene in the classroom where he fell.

199
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:05,794
The crew went on break, and everyone on the fourth floor returned to the first floor.

200
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:09,945
Later, Makoto-san headed up to the fourth floor ahead of the others for his stunt.

201
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:13,075
AD Hoegi-san was still down below.

202
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:16,555
Tokuzono-san came to the fourth floor before him.

203
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:20,574
Tokuzono-san said he couldn't find his favorite phone

204
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:22,585
and called it using another one.

205
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:26,554
Because there wasn't a scratch on the phone,

206
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,854
we know it wasn't dropped by accident.

207
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:31,815
It was placed outside the window to lure Tokuzono-san out there.

208
00:13:32,255 --> 00:13:33,345
And then...

209
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:39,515
From the beginning, the police assumed the phone had been tampered with in some way.

210
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:44,414
If a loud ringtone were set to sound when a certain number called,

211
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:47,735
the culprit could have startled Tokuzono-san.

212
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:50,624
But that number would remain in the phone's call history,

213
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:54,485
and more than anything, nobody heard a loud noise at that time.

214
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,594
The only sound anyone heard

215
00:13:56,595 --> 00:14:01,375
was the quiet fluttering Makoto-san heard on the fourth floor.

216
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:03,495
You mean the toy butterfly.

217
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:04,615
Yes.

218
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:09,285
The practical joke device found in Odori-san's belongings flew then.

219
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:11,954
The phone was unscathed

220
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:16,005
because it had to be place carefully on top of the butterfly.

221
00:14:17,735 --> 00:14:20,555
Tokuzono-san hated bugs.

222
00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:24,024
But Tokuzono-san immediately letting go of his phone,

223
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:27,645
which meant it remained unscratched, was unexpected.

224
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:30,145
So, who set it up?

225
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:34,665
Since Odori-san was hiding it, doesn't that mean it was him?

226
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:39,374
The butterfly flew inside through the fourth floor window by chance.

227
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:44,695
Odori-san entered the classroom after the fall and secretly took it with him.

228
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:48,545
That's how he determined the method used by the culprit.

229
00:14:48,925 --> 00:14:51,574
Right, Detective Queen?

230
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:52,925
Y-Yes.

231
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:58,175
Odori-san was killed because he tried to use that as evidence to threaten the culprit.

232
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:00,124
You're saying that not only was it not Odori-kun's prank,

233
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,805
but it also wasn't the reason he killed himself?

234
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:08,565
While checking the footage of Tokuzono-san's fall, Odori-san laughed.

235
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:14,415
Odori-san laughed because he saw a certain person from the footage.

236
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:18,095
Decisive evidence of the true culprit's guilt.

237
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:22,874
Look closely.

238
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:27,085
There's someone behaving strangely even though a person just fell.

239
00:15:33,855 --> 00:15:34,864
That's right.

240
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:37,465
They took no notice of Tokuzono-san's fall

241
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:40,205
and kept staring up at the fourth floor.

242
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:45,725
Makeup artist Aburai Hideka-san, you're the culprit.

243
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,954
You were watching to see where the practical joke device went.

244
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:55,235
You intended to retrieve it while everyone was distracted by Tokuzono-san.

245
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:59,225
But unfortunately, it flew inside the classroom.

246
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:02,285
Kyogoku-kun, you didn't see it?

247
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:06,285
No, but I feel like I heard the fluttering the whole time.

248
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:10,575
You decided to kill Odori-san after he threatened you.

249
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:15,584
Odori-san's phone was missing from his belongings

250
00:16:15,585 --> 00:16:17,545
because you swiped it to hide your conversation.

251
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:21,294
You can't expect me to sit quietly and listen to this.

252
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:25,245
If Hideka-chan is the culprit, then how did she poison him?

253
00:16:26,345 --> 00:16:30,435
There wasn't poison in Odori-san's shake or his straw.

254
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:34,065
Aburai-san used that straw to poison him.

255
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:37,674
She removed the straw's tip, made a vertical cut in it,

256
00:16:37,675 --> 00:16:40,505
and attached it to another straw like a cap.

257
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:45,075
Aburai-san coated the cap with poison beforehand

258
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,575
and said she couldn't take her allergy medicine

259
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:51,175
so the AD would go buy drinks.

260
00:16:51,585 --> 00:16:56,085
Naturally, she had already confirmed that the nearby shop would have the right shake.

261
00:16:56,335 --> 00:17:02,095
Then she pretended to help distribute drinks and swiped the straw she needed.

262
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:07,595
All that was left was to give Odori-san the straw with the cap.

263
00:17:08,305 --> 00:17:11,694
After killing him, she waited for an opportunity to remove the cap,

264
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:16,175
creating the mysterious murder in which no poison would be found anywhere.

265
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:19,275
Then show us the proof.

266
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:25,115
Aburai-san, did you take your allergy medicine?

267
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:26,365
What?

268
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:29,994
It's dangerous to carry a poisoned cap around against your bare skin.

269
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:34,164
If it were me, I'd roll it up and hide it inside a capsule

270
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:36,375
after committing the crime.

271
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,594
That's what you did, isn't it?

272
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:41,894
And because you hid it among the other capsules,

273
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,565
you can't take them anymore.

274
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,965
If that capsule were found, that would prove it was you.

275
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:49,644
There was just one problem.

276
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:52,974
Shakes typically come with straight straws.

277
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:55,895
It would be immediately obvious if one had a cap.

278
00:17:56,135 --> 00:17:58,545
In other words, that trick...

279
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:00,905
Yes.

280
00:18:01,435 --> 00:18:05,634
It was insurance in case I failed to kill Tokuzono-san using the practical joke device.

281
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:07,975
It wasn't meant for Odori-san.

282
00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:11,535
Tokuzono-san doesn't drink shakes.

283
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,654
I was lucky that nobody found the straw type suspicious

284
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:18,455
because the director handed Odori-san his shake.

285
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:21,095
Then it really was you?

286
00:18:21,695 --> 00:18:23,354
But why?

287
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:25,555
Was it because of Nishibe?

288
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:27,815
Yes.

289
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:34,514
Tokuzono-san's prank reminded him of how he hurt Jinmei-san.

290
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:36,565
He didn't get any sleep that night.

291
00:18:37,245 --> 00:18:40,874
But the next day, he said he was heading to the filming location.

292
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:45,045
He said he'd cause more trouble if he didn't go and took his car.

293
00:18:47,475 --> 00:18:50,744
I spent so much time wondering if I should kill him.

294
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:55,824
I kept telling myself that more than one thing caused the accident.

295
00:18:55,825 --> 00:18:57,085
But...

296
00:18:57,315 --> 00:19:01,335
Unlike you ADs, us actors can't be replaced.

297
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,604
After hearing those words today, I made up my mind.

298
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:11,765
I had to make him apologize to Nishibe-kun in the afterlife.

299
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:14,895
What?

300
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,564
Hey, open the door.

301
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:20,315
Open the door, Aburai-san.

302
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:32,355
Huh?

303
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:39,205
Sera-chan!

304
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,415
Crap.

305
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:45,955
Is she trying to kill herself by crashing into the school building?

306
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:52,145
Nishibe-kun.

307
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,314
Just wait.

308
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:57,355
I'm on my way.

309
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:05,155
Huh?

310
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:09,655
What?

311
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:16,745
R-Ran-san, hurry!

312
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:34,465
You idiot.

313
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,624
I was trying to kill myself so I could join Nishibe-kun.

314
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,555
Why did you stop me?!

315
00:20:40,345 --> 00:20:44,695
To save you from earning any more guilt.

316
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:46,834
What guilt?

317
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:49,315
I was just trying to kill myself.

318
00:20:49,455 --> 00:20:52,845
Lives don't belong to anyone.

319
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:57,085
They're something precious that should never be taken away.

320
00:21:01,165 --> 00:21:05,345
It's something I picked up from my friend's mom.

321
00:22:38,265 --> 00:22:39,645
Hideka-chan.

322
00:22:41,385 --> 00:22:44,855
I know this isn't the right time to say this,

323
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:48,325
but she looked incredible just now.

324
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:52,445
She reminds me of a young Fujimine Yukiko.

325
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:56,525
Maybe I'll scout her.

326
00:22:58,475 --> 00:23:00,825
You should talk to him first.

327
00:23:01,475 --> 00:23:05,274
He stopped a car from speeding into a building by himself.

328
00:23:05,275 --> 00:23:06,165
Yeah.

329
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,125
It's the birth of two new stars.

330
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:15,164
And so, the case was solved,

331
00:23:15,165 --> 00:23:19,515
and the tumultuous drama was rebooted.

332
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,175
But unfortunately...

333
00:23:22,975 --> 00:23:29,145
Y-Y-You're u-u-under arrest for interference of public duties.

334
00:23:29,445 --> 00:23:31,095
Cut.

335
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:34,154
He's stuttering too much.

336
00:23:34,155 --> 00:23:36,035
S-Sorry.

337
00:23:37,405 --> 00:23:39,575
Maybe he's not meant to be an actor.

338
00:23:39,695 --> 00:23:42,225
Makoto-san is so cute!

339
00:23:45,065 --> 00:23:48,335
Your eyes are like mine.

340
00:23:49,315 --> 00:23:50,455
They're sharp.

341
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:53,554
Falcons are delicate creatures.

342
00:23:53,555 --> 00:23:54,835
Be careful.

343
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:06,105
What was that?

344
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:07,225
Conan-kun.

345
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:08,605
Dad.

346
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:13,035
The next episode of Conan is "The Skilled Hawk Hides His Crimes!"
