1
00:00:00,461 --> 00:00:04,361
Suspicious of Inspector Otaki's actions, we followed him

2
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:08,061
and came to a mansion in the remote mountains.

3
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:11,261
There, we encounter siblings in a disquieting atmosphere

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,161
about to discuss the distribution of inheritance.

5
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:16,861
Everyone who gathers in the dining room

6
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:19,261
after receiving text mail from the owner of the mansion,

7
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:21,961
witness the eerie image of the owner outside the window,

8
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:23,961
and a monster flying through the sky.

9
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:28,061
After that, the second son is found dead.

10
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:33,861
Aim for a 100% solution.

11
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:36,361
Clear all mysteries and codes.

12
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:38,261
Danger closes in on Ran and Kazuha!

13
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:40,361
Solve the mystery to haunting phenomenon!

14
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:41,961
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:43,861
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:46,461
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:31,147
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (Three)"

18
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:35,747
This is bad, Kudo.

19
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:38,747
Yeah, if this murder was committed by Hikaru,

20
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:39,847
her motive is probably

21
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:41,947
to take revenge on the person who killed her mother,

22
00:02:41,947 --> 00:02:43,547
making it look like an accident!

23
00:02:43,547 --> 00:02:45,847
And the one who schemed this,

24
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:47,747
were Asanobu who was just found dead

25
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:50,747
and Ms. Shimizu the maid who died six months ago.

26
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:53,947
And if Kamiyo who hasn't been seen for a while,

27
00:02:53,947 --> 00:02:57,047
also took part in it...

28
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:59,047
She's probably already been killed and her body's

29
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:01,847
already in that locked freezer!

30
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:06,547
Kazuha and Ran are about to open it just now.

31
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:08,447
Ran and Kazuha are in trouble!

32
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:13,147
Oh, it opened. It opened, Ran!

33
00:03:13,147 --> 00:03:14,447
You did it!

34
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:18,347
What a loud thunder burst.

35
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:20,647
Yep. It's kind of scary.

36
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:22,647
But we cooked a lot of pot sticks!

37
00:03:22,647 --> 00:03:23,747
That's right, exactly!

38
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:26,647
We'll overcome this with garlic power!

39
00:03:28,647 --> 00:03:30,647
-Darn! -Just as I thought!

40
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:34,647
-Kazuha! -Are you all right? Ran?

41
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,847
Hikaru...

42
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:38,247
Hey, you!

43
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:45,947
Pot sticks?

44
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:47,047
"Hikaru Hinohara (24), Torakura Family Maid"

45
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:49,447
Oh, I was hungry,

46
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:53,247
so when I smelled the pot sticks, I just couldn't help myself.

47
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:55,747
I'm sorry! For eating without permission.

48
00:03:55,747 --> 00:03:58,947
But, it was really delicious!

49
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,647
Thank you...

50
00:04:02,647 --> 00:04:04,947
And? Did you look inside the freezer?

51
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:06,047
Yep.

52
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:08,547
Something strange was inside.

53
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:10,047
Huh?

54
00:04:11,147 --> 00:04:13,547
See, a large can of laver.

55
00:04:13,547 --> 00:04:18,747
My mom always also puts laver in the freezer so it doesn't go stale.

56
00:04:18,747 --> 00:04:20,547
But, usually not the entire can.

57
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:21,747
True.

58
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:23,747
Wasn't there anything else inside?

59
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:27,147
Nope. It's such a large freezer and yet...

60
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:30,447
To think that all that was in here was this can.

61
00:04:31,547 --> 00:04:33,647
Then, what was that anyway?

62
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:36,647
The trace of something being dragged along

63
00:04:36,647 --> 00:04:39,647
that was found on the floor.

64
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:41,547
How about up there?

65
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,747
The one on top is also a freezer and it wasn't locked.

66
00:04:44,747 --> 00:04:47,247
But it was packed fully with food.

67
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:51,647
Are you the only person who had the key to this freezer, Hikaru?

68
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:54,147
I think Hakuya has it too...

69
00:04:54,147 --> 00:04:56,747
Which means that he entrusted you

70
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:58,347
with all the keys to this mansion?

71
00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:00,447
No. The only keys I have

72
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:04,147
are the ones for this kitchen and the rooms nearby.

73
00:05:04,147 --> 00:05:08,247
The other maids and the butler have the rest of the keys.

74
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:12,847
-Is everyone still up, right? -Yes.

75
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:14,947
If so, will you please tell them to come to the kitchen?

76
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:18,047
So, we can serve them pot sticks for a late-night snack.

77
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:20,647
But, after such an incident,

78
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:22,947
I wonder if they'll be up to eating?

79
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,547
I was starved, though.

80
00:05:25,547 --> 00:05:27,647
After such an incident?

81
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:28,647
Do you want to know about it?

82
00:05:28,647 --> 00:05:30,647
No, I don't want to hear about it, no!

83
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:33,047
Well, don't worry.

84
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:37,147
Half the haunted phenomenon that occurred here today's been solved.

85
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:41,847
I'll bet everyone will regain his appetite after hearing so.

86
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,447
Hey. I hope you're serious?

87
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,347
About the problem having been solved.

88
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:53,647
Yeah, most of it.

89
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:57,147
Mystery? It's obvious who the culprit is.

90
00:05:57,147 --> 00:06:00,847
It's Hakuya, isn't it? The one who killed my husband?

91
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:04,047
Don't tell me you figured out the cause of why Hakuya

92
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:05,247
turned into a vampire?

93
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:07,947
Well, since too many strange things have been happening,

94
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:10,647
I can understand that you can't help feeling that way but...

95
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:11,647
-"Rikushige Koga (71), Butler" -I wonder if such a thing

96
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:13,947
as vampires really do exist?

97
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:15,947
Well, you can decide for yourself as to that

98
00:06:15,947 --> 00:06:18,547
after you watch this trick and tell me what you think.

99
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:19,947
This room is...

100
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,847
Are you also referring to the time

101
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:24,147
when Hakuya vanished from inside that coffin?

102
00:06:24,147 --> 00:06:26,747
Yeah. At first, there was nothing visibly done

103
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:32,447
to the tile under the coffin so it was a mystery, but...

104
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,647
The position of where the coffin was placed was different to begin with!

105
00:06:34,647 --> 00:06:36,847
-Huh? -The position was different?

106
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,447
See.

107
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:41,147
The carpet is slit

108
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:45,147
so that when you pull on it, this part can be pulled off.

109
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:48,347
And, if you pull the part of the carpet that has been pulled off...

110
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:52,747
The entrance of the hidden corridor appears.

111
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:55,047
A hidden corridor?

112
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,747
The entrance door is a sliding door

113
00:06:57,747 --> 00:07:00,047
and the hidden corridor is connected to the 1st floor storeroom.

114
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:04,247
But, there are no stair in the storeroom!

115
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:06,247
You just didn't realize there

116
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:08,147
since it was camouflaged by the hidden door

117
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:09,847
that moves shelf and all.

118
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,547
Come to think of it, after that trip,

119
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:16,847
I felt like the storeroom sort of seemed a bit more cluttered.

120
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:18,047
A trip?

121
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:20,447
Yes. About six months ago,

122
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:23,347
just before the incident of Ms. Shimizu occurred,

123
00:07:23,347 --> 00:07:27,247
the owner told everyone in the mansion to take a break

124
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,647
so we all went abroad for about a week.

125
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:34,247
Which means, this hidden corridor was built during that week.

126
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:35,647
Hey, hold it.

127
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:37,247
I understand the corridor,

128
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:39,847
but how did Hakuya come out of the coffin?

129
00:07:39,847 --> 00:07:41,147
That's simple.

130
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:45,947
There's a sliding door at the bottom of the coffin too.

131
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:49,547
And besides, on the place of the lid that matches,

132
00:07:49,547 --> 00:07:52,347
there is a strong magnet embedded

133
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,747
and it seems that once you close it, the lid locks.

134
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:58,047
Until you undo it, using this remote controller

135
00:07:58,047 --> 00:08:00,447
that was here in the storeroom.

136
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,947
In other words...

137
00:08:04,447 --> 00:08:06,147
If you use this trick,

138
00:08:06,147 --> 00:08:11,847
you can go in and out of the coffin at will.

139
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:13,847
Of course, it's possible to go out

140
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:16,447
and murder the maid Ms. Shimizu too.

141
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:20,247
Which means Ms. Shimizu was killed by Hakuya?

142
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:22,047
Yeah, probably so.

143
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:23,647
The gate guard of this mansion

144
00:08:23,647 --> 00:08:25,247
seems to have positioned there,

145
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:27,047
after the incident of Ms. Shimizu occurred.

146
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:30,247
If he could somehow lure Ms. Shimizu to come to the site,

147
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:32,647
it would be easy for him to go out to kill her,

148
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:35,947
still pretending to be asleep in the coffin.

149
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:38,447
And? Where's Hakuya now?

150
00:08:38,447 --> 00:08:39,847
Beats me.

151
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:43,747
He may be hiding somewhere, ambushing his next prey.

152
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:45,147
Oh, no.

153
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:48,347
But, if we all stay together we'll be fine,

154
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:50,747
because he's no monster.

155
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:52,647
Because a vampire who can go through walls

156
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:55,347
and fly through the sky

157
00:08:55,347 --> 00:08:57,947
wouldn't have to use hidden corridor, would he?

158
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:03,847
Wow, what a downpour!

159
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:05,747
What bum weather for sure.

160
00:09:05,747 --> 00:09:09,647
Right. Everyone's late, don't you think?

161
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:11,947
And, we've cooked so many pot sticks.

162
00:09:11,947 --> 00:09:14,847
By the way, Ran. I wonder what's up?

163
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:18,047
The thing that Hikaru mentioned a while ago.

164
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:21,147
I wonder but I'd rather not think about it.

165
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:23,847
If by chance, if the owner of this mansion that we saw

166
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:25,947
is really a vampire,

167
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:28,247
maybe Heiji and Conan's been bitten,

168
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:30,547
and transformed one after the other into vampires...

169
00:09:30,547 --> 00:09:35,647
No way! You mean we're the only humans in this mansion?

170
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:37,747
It can't be.

171
00:09:37,747 --> 00:09:39,247
No, it can't.

172
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:41,147
No good. After all this ridiculous talk,

173
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,047
I'm starting to get hungry.

174
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:44,947
Then, shall we take a bite?

175
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:47,847
We can just cook more after everyone gets here!

176
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:49,947
Which means that the psychic picture

177
00:09:49,947 --> 00:09:53,247
we took in this room is also a trick?

178
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:56,147
Yep! Will you all get into the same position that you were in

179
00:09:56,147 --> 00:09:58,047
when the picture was being taken?

180
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:59,447
Okay.

181
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:02,847
Come on, smile everybody!

182
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:05,447
Heiji relax more too!

183
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:07,747
-Huh? -Heiji?

184
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:09,047
What're you talking about?

185
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:11,647
There are only five of us here in this room including you.

186
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:13,747
There is another person behind you!

187
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,347
What's going on?

188
00:10:17,347 --> 00:10:19,747
Isn't this a mirror?

189
00:10:19,747 --> 00:10:21,547
It's a magic mirror!

190
00:10:21,547 --> 00:10:25,147
If one side of it is dark, it looks like a mirror.

191
00:10:25,147 --> 00:10:29,247
But if you light up the dark side, it becomes like glass!

192
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,347
It's easy to see right through the trick.

193
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:33,647
All you have to do is stick your finger on to it.

194
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:35,047
Finger?

195
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:37,047
With a normal mirror, there'll be a gap

196
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:39,047
between your finger and its reflection,

197
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:44,747
since a reflective coating is applied to the glass's back surface.

198
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:46,647
But in a magic mirror, the reflective surface

199
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,147
is on the front surface of the glass,

200
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,647
the real image and the image in the mirror

201
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:52,247
look as if they are stuck together!

202
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:55,347
Well, when we lit the light from this side,

203
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:58,047
we could see all the clothes that were hanging!

204
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:00,047
All the clothes hanging?

205
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:02,347
I get it!

206
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:04,347
The closet of the next room!

207
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:06,747
Exactly!

208
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:10,147
There's a sliding door on the closet's back wall.

209
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:13,247
If opened, the magic mirror will appear at the spot

210
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:15,847
where the mirror frame of the next room is.

211
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:18,247
All that needs to be done after this is,

212
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:20,047
just before taking the picture, the person in the closet

213
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,447
shines light on his own face.

214
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:25,047
Then a psychic picture of that person's blurry face

215
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:28,347
emerging in the mirror is completed.

216
00:11:28,347 --> 00:11:30,347
So, now you know.

217
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:33,247
The culprit desperately used the trick

218
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,747
to make himself look like a monster.

219
00:11:35,747 --> 00:11:38,447
It means that he's merely human!

220
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,447
So is the culprit Hakuya after all?

221
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:44,647
Yeah! There's no doubt, he's one of the culprits!

222
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:46,347
One of the culprits?

223
00:11:46,347 --> 00:11:48,147
Does he have an accomplice?

224
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:51,047
Hakuya's got a serious illness, doesn't he?

225
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:52,647
He wouldn't be able to move around

226
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:55,747
without getting help from someone else, would he?

227
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:59,547
And for now, the prime suspect of being an accomplice

228
00:11:59,547 --> 00:12:02,947
is the oldest daughter who has been gone for several hours now.

229
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:06,547
I just got word from the gate guard

230
00:12:06,547 --> 00:12:08,147
that a person was found dead in the forest

231
00:12:08,147 --> 00:12:10,447
in front of the mansion.

232
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:11,847
What?

233
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,347
It's the oldest daughter, Kamiyo!

234
00:12:21,347 --> 00:12:23,147
She's tied to a pole...

235
00:12:23,147 --> 00:12:24,147
Strangulation.

236
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:27,447
You're guards, aren't you?

237
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,647
Haven't you seen who left to go out with her?

238
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:33,647
No. The thing is after the man called Otaki

239
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:36,347
and the man with a mustache drove away in the car,

240
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:39,347
no one left out the gate.

241
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:42,747
That can't be! Then, how did she go out of the gate?

242
00:12:42,747 --> 00:12:44,947
Are you telling me she flew through the sky or what?

243
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:46,351
Really?

244
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:49,551
You really didn't open the gate of the mansion

245
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:51,651
since Mr. Otaki left with his car?

246
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:53,151
Oh, well...

247
00:12:53,151 --> 00:12:55,051
We did open the gate once.

248
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:57,751
Because the furniture company truck came.

249
00:12:57,751 --> 00:12:59,951
The owner had ordered the chairs

250
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:03,451
he wanted to buy newly from several days ago

251
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:05,751
but when we checked the package, they mistakenly

252
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,951
had brought a sofa.

253
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:11,151
So, we told them to take it back with them for today,

254
00:13:11,151 --> 00:13:13,351
and that's when there was that explosion.

255
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:16,251
You mean of the tunnel collapsing?

256
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:20,051
Yeah. I watched for a while.

257
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:22,051
If the culprit used that split moment,

258
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,551
it may have been possible to go out the gate without being noticed.

259
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:27,951
But after tying the corpse to the pole,

260
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:31,251
whoever went out would be noticed when coming back.

261
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:34,651
Besides, why did the culprit stop part way?

262
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:36,051
Part way?

263
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:39,451
Look! There's a hole near the corpse.

264
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,651
I think the culprit was planning to stand her corpse.

265
00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:43,751
True.

266
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:48,451
If it's the same culprit who killed Ms. Shimizu six months ago,

267
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:51,951
the culprit might've done it to drain her blood.

268
00:13:51,951 --> 00:13:53,751
The strange bruise on the right upper arm

269
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:57,051
of the corpse bothers me too.

270
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:58,551
The thing that bothers me most though

271
00:13:58,551 --> 00:14:02,751
is that the fingertips of both her hands are wounded badly.

272
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,851
True. It doesn't look like something that was incurred

273
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:08,151
when she tried to fight the culprit off either.

274
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,251
Kamiyo...

275
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:17,451
Was found killed in the forest?

276
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:19,551
Was it really Honey?

277
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:20,851
Yeah.

278
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:24,451
Oh, no. Why?

279
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:27,351
More than that, who's the culprit?

280
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:29,151
The gate guards should've witnessed somebody, right?

281
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:31,851
They say that after Inspector Otaki left by car,

282
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:34,651
no one went in or out of the gate.

283
00:14:34,651 --> 00:14:35,951
Nobody did?

284
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:37,251
It can't be.

285
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,451
Maybe there are other hidden corridors or something

286
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:42,051
and the culprit could've gone out of the gate from there?

287
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:45,051
I looked once around the fences of the mansion,

288
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,651
but there was nowhere that you could go out from.

289
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:50,751
The gate guards said that there are sensors on top of the fence

290
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:55,151
and if someone were to go over it, they would be caught right away.

291
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:58,551
Then, maybe from a tunnel or something from the mansion?

292
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:02,851
The owner made renovations on the mansion in just a week.

293
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:06,951
There's no way that a tunnel can be dug in such a short time.

294
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:08,551
That's ridiculous?

295
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:11,651
Then how did the culprit make it out of the gate?

296
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:13,551
Moreover, take Kamiyo along?

297
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:15,551
They flew.

298
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:21,251
Hakuya who turned into a vampire with those abhorrent wings.

299
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:23,951
Cool head, Ruri.

300
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:26,051
This young police detective said that

301
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,251
there're no such things as vampires, didn't he?

302
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:30,351
Police detective? No, wrong.

303
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:34,051
I'm Heiji Hattori! A high school detective from Osaka!

304
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:35,651
A detective?

305
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:38,251
I thought you were too young to be a police detective.

306
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:40,351
You're only a high school kid?

307
00:15:40,351 --> 00:15:42,651
Well, I'm going to check things a bit more,

308
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,351
so will you all wait in the dining room again?

309
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:47,751
-Hey. -You've gotta be kidding!

310
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:50,051
I was listening to you because I thought you were an officer but...

311
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:52,851
Honey was killed after all too!

312
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:56,251
I'll protect myself on my own.

313
00:15:56,251 --> 00:15:58,251
Everyone... Hey, hold it!

314
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:01,951
Oh. So you're not a police officer.

315
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:05,751
But if you're a detective, are you training under Mr. Mouri?

316
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:09,851
Huh? Why should I train under that goofy?

317
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:13,951
That's right!

318
00:16:13,951 --> 00:16:15,951
I'm supposed to be getting a certificate of proficiency

319
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:17,651
from my trainer Mouri soon.

320
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:20,451
Then, can you figure out

321
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:23,751
the trick of how the owner swung his body around?

322
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:24,851
Swung?

323
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,951
Remember, the time when the owner stuck his head out

324
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:31,651
from the window of the dining room hanging.

325
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:34,051
But, before the curtains were opened,

326
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:35,351
the owner's silhouette that was lit up

327
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:36,851
the flash of lightning came from below

328
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:39,051
and wasn't upside.

329
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:42,851
Moreover, his body seemed to be like that of a ghost!

330
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:49,051
If I remember correctly, it was here, wasn't it?

331
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,751
The place where the owner's neck was seen through the window.

332
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:51,951
Yeah.

333
00:16:55,951 --> 00:16:57,651
How about it, Kudo?

334
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:59,551
Just as we figured!

335
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,151
Which means that the thing in question...

336
00:17:08,951 --> 00:17:11,251
Great idea.

337
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:14,751
But this large-scale trick...

338
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,551
Isn't something that can be done right after

339
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:18,451
coming to his mansion.

340
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:22,151
Uh, the foursome, do they come to this mansion often?

341
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:28,551
They were here when I was a child and my mother brought me here.

342
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:31,551
But after becoming a maid, it's the first time I've met them.

343
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,851
It's been a year since they've all been here.

344
00:17:35,851 --> 00:17:38,551
Everyone asks about how Hakuya is doing

345
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:41,851
or about his health on the phone.

346
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:44,751
But they rarely come here.

347
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:49,251
That's why I thought that somebody among them was "pregnant"

348
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:53,151
and gathered here to celebrate.

349
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,651
Pregnant?

350
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:59,051
Because the owner was buying a pool for children

351
00:17:59,051 --> 00:18:01,551
and toy planes by internet shopping

352
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:05,151
which I thought were gifts for the coming baby!

353
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,451
Before I became a maid here,

354
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:09,651
he used to often buy me clothes and such, too.

355
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:13,051
Is that airplane one that flaps its wings and flies?

356
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:16,351
Yes, it was written so on the invoice.

357
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:21,151
I thought the box was quite large to be a child's toy.

358
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:24,851
But, when I asked Kamiyo who came with Mr. Hagawa,

359
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:27,451
whether she was pregnant,

360
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:30,751
they said, "No, no way" while laughing.

361
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:35,551
Then, Kishiharu who came later, was holding a big bag,

362
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:38,751
so I thought that maybe he had brought a gift.

363
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,751
But, he told me that he had his camera

364
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:42,551
and tools for developing films inside.

365
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:44,951
I also asked Mr. and Mrs. Asanobu Torakura

366
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:47,651
who came a bit earlier than you did, about it,

367
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:49,051
And Ruri remarked,

368
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:52,351
"I wonder if Mina and Mr. Hagawa got back together again?"

369
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:54,651
Then, did you ask everybody else too?

370
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:58,751
Yes, because they came a bit later than you did.

371
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:00,851
I was given the cold shoulder, though.

372
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:02,851
Get back together again? Does that mean that...

373
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,551
Mina and Mr. Hagawa were going with each other?

374
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:08,551
Yes. But, it seems that passionate Mina

375
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:12,551
came on too strong for Mr. Hawgawa.

376
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,151
And, before we knew it, Mr. Hagawa had changed partners to Kamiyo.

377
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:17,951
Then, what about Kishiharu and Ruri?

378
00:19:17,951 --> 00:19:21,951
Those two were engaged to begin with

379
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:24,751
but after Yoko passed away because of the accident,

380
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:27,251
Kishiharu became deeply depressed

381
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,451
and called off the engagement.

382
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:34,051
Then, Asanobu proposed to Ruri and they got married.

383
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:35,751
It seems that Kishiharu

384
00:19:35,751 --> 00:19:42,451
really liked Yoko who was the owner's fiance.

385
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:44,251
On the day of Yoko's funeral,

386
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,851
he was crying more than the owner.

387
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:50,051
But, I heard the maids say that

388
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:52,351
you were crying a lot too, Mr. Koga.

389
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:55,051
They say it was probably because you got along very well with her.

390
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:57,051
No.

391
00:19:57,051 --> 00:19:59,051
Things sort of seem so messed up.

392
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:03,251
Yeah. Everyone seems to have a motive.

393
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:08,351
Oh, it's text mail from Kishiharu.

394
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:11,351
He wants me to bring sake up to his room.

395
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:14,351
Does he know your mail address?

396
00:20:14,351 --> 00:20:16,651
Not only does Kishiharu know!

397
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:18,551
On the day before they came here,

398
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,151
I sent everyone text mail

399
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:22,051
that we'd be waiting for them to arrive.

400
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:23,951
Why go out of your way to do so?

401
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:24,951
Because the other day,

402
00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:29,151
the owner gave me everyone's mail address so...

403
00:20:29,151 --> 00:20:31,151
I thought he meant for me to greet all

404
00:20:31,151 --> 00:20:35,051
who were coming beforehand, so I sent out the text mail.

405
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:38,051
I often exchange text mail with the owner, you see.

406
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:41,751
Then, when he told you to come to the European room also...

407
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:44,051
Yes. I got texted!

408
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:45,851
-See! -After breakfast,

409
00:20:45,851 --> 00:20:48,651
come to the European room, without telling anyone about it.

410
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:51,851
Make sure that the butler doesn't see you coming.

411
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,251
But, I saw this mail after noon,

412
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:59,351
so, I ended up standing him up.

413
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:01,451
You didn't notice the mail?

414
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:03,451
I had completely forgotten that

415
00:21:03,451 --> 00:21:06,451
I was charging my cell phone in the bathroom.

416
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:08,851
It's from Kishiharu, asking me to come ASAP!

417
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,451
I've got to go!

418
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:13,051
From the text mail...

419
00:21:13,051 --> 00:21:17,851
It doesn't sound like the owner doesn't like her at all.

420
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:21,451
No joke, you mean nobody's coming to eat the pot sticks?

421
00:21:21,451 --> 00:21:22,851
Have they all gone to sleep?

422
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:26,951
No. I think that everyone is up

423
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:29,251
but doesn't feel up to eating.

424
00:21:29,251 --> 00:21:32,751
I think it's best that both of you hurry and get to bed.

425
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:36,651
Oh, no. When the pot sticks came out so deliciously...

426
00:21:36,651 --> 00:21:40,451
But we ate most of it already.

427
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:42,151
True.

428
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:44,851
What shall we do if Conan and Heiji come to eat some?

429
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:49,051
We've got more ingredients, so we could just make more, right?

430
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:54,051
I'm sure the culprit is that person.

431
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:55,551
Right, Kudo?

432
00:21:55,551 --> 00:21:58,851
Yeah. But we have no proof.

433
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:00,151
Besides...

434
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:03,551
The way that Kamiyo was killed.

435
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:07,051
Unless we can figure out that trick, our hands are tied.

436
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:10,451
How did that person go pass the gate

437
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:13,351
and kill Kamiyo in the forest?

438
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:40,351
I hope my daughter's okay?

439
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:50,951
Now we know for sure

440
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:55,851
that we're not dealing with a vampire with wings.

441
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,351
Yeah. It's an evil creature all right.

442
00:23:59,351 --> 00:24:02,051
But it's a murderer rather than a vampire!

443
00:24:02,051 --> 00:24:03,551
Next Conan,

444
00:24:03,551 --> 00:24:07,651
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (Four)"
