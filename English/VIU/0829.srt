1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:01,772
"Kometo Brigde"

2
00:00:01,773 --> 00:00:03,372
This river...

3
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:06,672
dries up during this season.

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,773
What a dirty bridge.

5
00:00:09,673 --> 00:00:12,272
The railing is completely black.

6
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:14,472
So, what is it you want to talk to me about?

7
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:18,372
Oh, there's something I want to show you right across the bridge.

8
00:00:18,373 --> 00:00:21,172
Gosh, I tell you

9
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:24,072
I want to go to the shopping arcade in front of the station.

10
00:00:24,073 --> 00:00:26,873
I'm sorry, it won't take long.

11
00:00:34,873 --> 00:00:36,872
What's up, gramps?

12
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:38,673
Hey, what's that?

13
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,573
What's that?

14
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:56,972
A canvas stained black with crime.

15
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,372
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color!

16
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:01,472
A glowing toy leads to a case.

17
00:01:01,473 --> 00:01:03,672
A chance meeting causes a miracle.

18
00:01:03,673 --> 00:01:05,372
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:05,373 --> 00:01:07,372
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:09,673
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:54,224
"Wonder Boy"

22
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:57,923
Hey, you guys.

23
00:02:57,924 --> 00:03:00,923
Are you going to look for UFOs again tonight?

24
00:03:00,924 --> 00:03:04,623
Of course, we've already been going for two days.

25
00:03:04,624 --> 00:03:06,923
There was nothing those two days though.

26
00:03:06,924 --> 00:03:09,923
That's why we think it'll come around tonight.

27
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:11,523
-That's right. -That's right.

28
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,723
UFOs...

29
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:17,023
Oh, you don't believe us, after all.

30
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:19,323
Since this month there've already

31
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,523
been three eye-witness reports, three, you know?

32
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:24,823
And all of them were near Kometo Bridge here.

33
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:26,723
A thing that glowed goldenly

34
00:03:26,724 --> 00:03:29,723
seems to have flown through the riverbed at tremendous speed.

35
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:31,223
Yes, that's right.

36
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:32,323
There are people saying

37
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:34,223
they've seen extraterrestrials at the riverbed, too.

38
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:37,423
We, as members of the Detective Squad, cannot overlook this.

39
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:40,023
That's not the job of a detective, is it?

40
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:42,723
Anyway, we're going through with it tonight, too.

41
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:45,023
Aye!

42
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,124
Look, the curtains of "Nagai Toy Shop" are open.

43
00:03:49,424 --> 00:03:52,124
Maybe they're going to be opening the shop again?

44
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:58,023
It won't open.

45
00:03:58,024 --> 00:04:01,923
They closed quite some time ago.

46
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:04,223
I came here several times, too.

47
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:08,123
A kind looking grandpa and grandma used to run this shop.

48
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:11,823
But there wasn't much of anything I wanted,

49
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:14,624
because all the toys were of the olden days.

50
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:19,023
Hey, what're you doing? Let's go.

51
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:21,323
Yeah.

52
00:04:21,324 --> 00:04:24,323
Your hands are smeared with ice cream.

53
00:04:24,324 --> 00:04:26,023
Sorry, sorry.

54
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:28,224
Gosh, I'm all sticky.

55
00:04:30,724 --> 00:04:32,623
"Tsutomu Oshiro (30)" -I tell you, even shops like this...

56
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:35,923
"Kuromaru Finance Employee" -are still of some interest to kids.

57
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:37,623
That boy wearing glasses was

58
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:40,423
staring with great interest at this locomotive.

59
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:41,523
Hey, don't!

60
00:04:41,524 --> 00:04:42,624
Don't touch it.

61
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:46,024
Don't scare me. I dropped it.

62
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:49,723
"Tokujiro Nagai (72)" -Never mind that stuff already.

63
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:53,123
"Owner of Nagai Toy Shop" -This is something my wife treasured.

64
00:04:53,124 --> 00:04:57,023
Anyway, sell this shop and make money.

65
00:04:57,024 --> 00:04:59,324
I can't wait any longer.

66
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:04,023
Okay, I'll do as you say.

67
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:05,123
Really?

68
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:07,023
Yeah. But in exchange for that,

69
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:10,224
will you at least offer incense to the altar?

70
00:05:11,624 --> 00:05:13,723
I can't be doing something like that.

71
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:16,923
I see. I got it, then.

72
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:19,423
Oh, right. Take this with you.

73
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:21,823
You like liquor, don't you?

74
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:25,723
Is it okay? Isn't that expensive Scotch?

75
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:29,223
I bought it when I went on a trip to Britain with my wife.

76
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:31,524
I stopped drinking, you see.

77
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:34,924
Thank you.

78
00:05:37,524 --> 00:05:39,324
This is good stuff.

79
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:43,923
I'll come again with the documents, then.

80
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:45,424
See you.

81
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:54,324
Gosh, that brat.

82
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,723
What? Are you going out, too?

83
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:02,923
I have something to talk to you about.

84
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:04,523
Come with me, will you?

85
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:05,623
Talk to me?

86
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:07,624
Sure, I guess.

87
00:06:11,224 --> 00:06:13,223
"Kometo Brigde" -This river...

88
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:16,723
dries up during this season.

89
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:19,723
What a dirty bridge.

90
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:22,323
The railing's completely black.

91
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:24,523
So, what did you want to talk to me about?

92
00:06:24,524 --> 00:06:28,223
Oh, there's something I want to show you across the bridge.

93
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:31,023
Gosh, I tell you

94
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:34,223
I want to go to the shopping arcade in front of the station.

95
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:36,924
I'm sorry, it won't take long.

96
00:06:41,424 --> 00:06:42,823
This way!

97
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:45,023
That's unmistakably a UFO.

98
00:06:45,024 --> 00:06:47,823
It came flying over from the bridge and landed.

99
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,223
Really? I didn't see anything.

100
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:53,124
I didn't either.

101
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:57,423
It was around here that the lights went out.

102
00:06:57,424 --> 00:06:59,123
Okay, let's start searching!

103
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:00,523
-Aye! -Aye!

104
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:02,323
It's along the wall, I'm sure.

105
00:07:02,324 --> 00:07:04,624
Along the wall? It's a UFO.

106
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,324
What's this?

107
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:10,423
This is...

108
00:07:10,424 --> 00:07:12,424
Why is something like this over here?

109
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:16,624
Hey, Edogawa?

110
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:21,524
You guys stay away!

111
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:26,223
Haibara, call the police.

112
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:27,224
All right.

113
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:33,723
The victim is Tsutomu Oshiro, age 30.

114
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:37,623
It seems he worked at Kuromaru Finance in Haido.

115
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,923
A loan shark debt collector?

116
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:41,823
Yes, probably.

117
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:43,923
According to the security camera of the shopping arcade,

118
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:45,923
at about 4:00 pm, he went out of the station,

119
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,323
walked through the shopping arcade

120
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:49,823
and headed directly over this way.

121
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:53,623
It's most likely that he came around here to collect debts.

122
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:55,123
I see.

123
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:56,723
Judging from the circumstances,

124
00:07:56,724 --> 00:07:58,823
it's likely he got drunk

125
00:07:58,824 --> 00:08:01,923
and fell off this bridge.

126
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:05,423
But just in case, go check on Kuromaru Finance tomorrow.

127
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:07,223
Yes, sir.

128
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:10,023
So you guys in order to look for UFOs

129
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:11,323
came here?

130
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,523
Yes...

131
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:14,323
Did you hear any suspicious sounds

132
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:17,023
or see any suspicious characters back then?

133
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:18,523
Thanks everyone.

134
00:08:18,524 --> 00:08:19,723
By the looks of it,

135
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:22,123
it's most likely an accident.

136
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:23,423
After the investigation is done...

137
00:08:23,424 --> 00:08:25,124
Hey, Inspector Megure.

138
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:30,323
There's a printout for a half-price discount ticket

139
00:08:30,324 --> 00:08:33,523
for a ramen shop in this person's wallet.

140
00:08:33,524 --> 00:08:35,623
What about it?

141
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:38,223
To have printed it out like this and bring it along with him,

142
00:08:38,224 --> 00:08:41,823
he must've really wanted to eat ramen at Shinobiya.

143
00:08:41,824 --> 00:08:43,723
But it's strange, isn't it?

144
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,523
This bridge doesn't lead

145
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:48,923
to Shinobiya Ramen near the station shopping center.

146
00:08:48,924 --> 00:08:52,523
Maybe he was planning to go on another day.

147
00:08:52,524 --> 00:08:56,623
No, this discount ticket is only valid till today.

148
00:08:56,624 --> 00:09:01,423
Which means he was planning to drop by after work.

149
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:04,423
If so, it's strange after all,

150
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:06,124
that he would go pass here.

151
00:09:07,324 --> 00:09:11,423
If he finished work, he wouldn't have gone by this road.

152
00:09:11,424 --> 00:09:12,723
And if he wasn't finished,

153
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:15,224
he wouldn't have been drinking either.

154
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:17,524
This is...

155
00:09:24,624 --> 00:09:26,224
Who is it?

156
00:09:44,924 --> 00:09:46,324
Who is it?

157
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:07,024
What's the matter at this hour of the night?

158
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:11,024
I live near here but forgot my house key

159
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:12,824
and can't get inside.

160
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:15,024
Where are your mother and father?

161
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:16,524
They're not home.

162
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:19,424
May I stay here until they come back?

163
00:10:19,425 --> 00:10:20,725
Here?

164
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:23,524
No, sorry, I don't think...

165
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:26,724
Somebody died at Kometo Bridge.

166
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:27,924
A person?

167
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:31,324
That explains the sirens I heard.

168
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:33,824
A murder, it seems.

169
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:36,524
It's gotten dangerous around here.

170
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:38,924
Okay, come in.

171
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:41,724
If just for a little while you can wait here.

172
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,225
Thank you.

173
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:49,624
What're you doing?

174
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,925
Come in.

175
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:56,824
This flashing boomerang is nostalgic, isn't it?

176
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:59,825
I haven't seen it around recently.

177
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:02,724
Did it broke?

178
00:11:02,725 --> 00:11:06,624
Yeah. It was on the shelf, but it dropped.

179
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,324
The shelf, you mean there?

180
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:09,724
Right.

181
00:11:09,725 --> 00:11:13,625
I tried to take it but dropped it.

182
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:17,424
Do you live here alone, Grandpa?

183
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:20,725
Yeah. My wife died last year.

184
00:11:21,825 --> 00:11:23,324
She was in the hospital

185
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:25,524
because of a difficult illness.

186
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:27,824
Were you alone all this time?

187
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:28,925
Yeah.

188
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,624
Did someone come to see you today?

189
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,024
No, nobody came.

190
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:38,524
Were you here all this time?

191
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:41,625
Yeah, I was here all day today.

192
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:52,424
What are you doing, sonny?

193
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:54,724
Does your shoulder hurt, Grandpa?

194
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:57,024
From about six months ago.

195
00:11:57,025 --> 00:12:00,424
When I try to raise my arm, it hurts really bad.

196
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:03,324
But how'd you know?

197
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:06,624
The lower part of this shelf is clean,

198
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,124
but the upper part is full of dust, right?

199
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,624
So, I thought maybe you can't raise your arm.

200
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,924
It's exactly as you say, sonny.

201
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:18,024
Cleaning the upper shelf is hard.

202
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:20,824
Then, you can't take the locomotive, can you?

203
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:24,724
-What? -That shelf is up pretty high.

204
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:28,424
How did you take the locomotive if your shoulder hurts so bad?

205
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:32,024
I tried to do what I couldn't that's why I dropped it.

206
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:34,424
Why did you try to take it when you couldn't?

207
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:36,324
There's no reason.

208
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:40,024
I was here alone, so I started feeling nostalgic.

209
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:44,024
But I'm sure somebody came to see you today.

210
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:46,324
How do you know?

211
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:48,924
I'm not lying.

212
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:51,824
The traces of shoe polish are left behind.

213
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:53,724
Is something wrong?

214
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:55,724
See, look over there on the floor.

215
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:58,225
There's a brown stain, right?

216
00:13:01,725 --> 00:13:03,925
That's the remains of shoe polish, right?

217
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:08,624
Come to think of it, it seems that the person

218
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,124
who was found dead by the bridge was also wearing brown shoes.

219
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,824
An insurance salesman came at noon.

220
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:16,924
Those traces are probably his.

221
00:13:16,925 --> 00:13:18,824
I'm not interested in insurance,

222
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:20,824
so I had him leave right away, though.

223
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:23,224
That's why I forgot about it.

224
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:26,524
This trace was left behind when someone wears his shoes.

225
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:30,524
Which means that person took off his shoes and came in here, right?

226
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:34,324
Why did you let him in when you had no interest in insurance?

227
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:38,024
Sonny, isn't it about time your parents are coming home?

228
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,624
Grandpa, try smelling my hand.

229
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,124
Sonny, that's enough.

230
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,925
Please.

231
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:51,324
You smell strawberries, right?

232
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,024
Yeah, I do.

233
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:55,024
At sundown today, my friend

234
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:58,524
touched the door here with ice cream on his hands.

235
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:01,524
I touched the door a while ago when I opened it.

236
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:03,524
So see, it smells of strawberries.

237
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:06,724
I see, I'll wipe it in the morning.

238
00:14:06,725 --> 00:14:10,525
This same smell was on the man who died, too.

239
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:14,024
He came here today, didn't he?

240
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:16,824
What... what are you getting at, sonny?

241
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:18,124
It sounds like you think

242
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,624
that I'm involved with the case or something.

243
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,024
You are, aren't you?

244
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:26,424
You killed him, didn't you?

245
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:29,824
What... what a thing to say.

246
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:32,324
If it's as you say,

247
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:36,324
you're here together with a murderer.

248
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:38,124
Aren't you afraid?

249
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,124
I'm not scared.

250
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:43,125
Because I know you're really not a bad person, Grandpa.

251
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:59,524
No matter what you say, I have nothing to do with any murder.

252
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:03,624
First of all, didn't that man mistakenly fall off the bridge?

253
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,324
You threw this from the bridge

254
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:08,724
and when that man was distracted seeing this,

255
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:11,024
you pushed him over.

256
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:15,124
I don't think a toy boomerang would fly that well, though.

257
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:18,824
You experimented at the riverbed several times, didn't you?

258
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:23,224
To test how the boomerang would glow and fly.

259
00:15:23,225 --> 00:15:26,724
When people saw it, they started saying it was a UFO.

260
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,524
A UFO?

261
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:31,424
It's a rumor among us, too.

262
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:33,224
Ridiculous.

263
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,924
Besides, why would I have to do something

264
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:39,324
as troublesome as that to push somebody off a bridge?

265
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:42,824
The man who died was young and of good built,

266
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:44,724
so you couldn't match up to him in strength.

267
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:48,324
Besides, you have a bad shoulder and you can't raise your arms.

268
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:50,624
That's why you had to distract him with something,

269
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,424
then scoop up his legs.

270
00:15:53,425 --> 00:15:56,724
How do you know I scooped his legs?

271
00:15:56,725 --> 00:16:00,124
The dirt of the railing wasn't on the slacks of the corpse.

272
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,524
On the other hand, the palm of his hand was dirty and completely black.

273
00:16:03,525 --> 00:16:06,624
It's proof that he was leaning over holding the railing.

274
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,324
But that doesn't show that I did it, does it?

275
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:13,224
I could never do something so ruthless as to kill somebody...

276
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:17,724
No store sells this toy boomerang anymore.

277
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:19,524
But there are a lot here.

278
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:22,124
And the strawberry ice cream, too.

279
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,124
It's only a coincidence.

280
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,124
I don't know anything.

281
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,624
If so, how did you know he fell off the bridge?

282
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,725
I just said that somebody died at the bridge.

283
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:35,924
If you hear that someone died at the bridge,

284
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:37,524
you'd think he fell, right?

285
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:41,424
That guy drank too much Scotch and accidentally fell off.

286
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:43,025
I'm sure that's...

287
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:49,224
How do you know that the victim was drinking Scotch?

288
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:53,125
You didn't say beer or plain whisky but Scotch?

289
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,924
I just thought so

290
00:16:56,925 --> 00:16:58,625
for some reason.

291
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,724
It doesn't move, does it?

292
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:11,424
It seems to be missing a part.

293
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:14,124
I think it's a small gear.

294
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,724
Did you try looking for it?

295
00:17:15,725 --> 00:17:16,924
Of course.

296
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:20,224
Uh, try remembering once more.

297
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:22,725
The time when the locomotive dropped.

298
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,925
I think the gear went into the shoe.

299
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:39,924
It seems the police doesn't think he died of a mere accident, too.

300
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,524
I think that they'll find out right away

301
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:44,824
that he came here, too.

302
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:48,625
On top of that, if the gear is found in his shoe.

303
00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:54,124
My wife was ill and in the hospital for a long time.

304
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:57,024
It cost a lot of money, too.

305
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:59,624
I ended up borrowing money from a bad place

306
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:03,224
to pay for the hospital bills.

307
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:07,024
The man who fell from the bridge and died was a debt collector.

308
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:09,924
He was really cruel.

309
00:18:09,925 --> 00:18:13,624
But nothing bothered me.

310
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,724
Because it was all for my wife.

311
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:18,624
But that guy...

312
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:23,424
went over to where my wife was hospitalized and asked to be repaid.

313
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:27,124
My wife who got depressed suddenly got worse.

314
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,124
Her last words were...

315
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,325
"I'm sorry".

316
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:40,424
I remember you now, sonny.

317
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:43,324
I thought you looked familiar.

318
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:46,524
Yes. You're the one who came to the shop, aren't you?

319
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,525
Back then...

320
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:51,624
Who dropped it?

321
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,425
Oh, I don't know.

322
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:06,024
That boy's the one who dropped the locomotive.

323
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:07,924
It... it wasn't me.

324
00:19:07,925 --> 00:19:09,924
Don't say stuff like that.

325
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:11,724
I'm not just saying it.

326
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:15,024
Your shoeprints are on the footstool there.

327
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:18,624
The one who did it got on it and tried to take the locomotive.

328
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,524
This is the print of the sneakers of a boy.

329
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:24,224
So the girls are excluded.

330
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:27,624
All the remaining three are wearing sneakers.

331
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,724
But the soil that is left on the footstool

332
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:32,024
is damp and sticky.

333
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:34,125
This is not what was found on the school campus.

334
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,824
Yes, it's the soil of the shrine in the back.

335
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:41,624
The soil on your shoes is dry.

336
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,424
It's probably from school,

337
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:46,124
so you're not the one.

338
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,624
You're tall,

339
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,524
so you don't need a footstool to take the locomotive.

340
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:52,025
So, we're left with...

341
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,225
only you.

342
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:58,025
Hey! Wait!

343
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,324
Why don't you go after him?

344
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:06,424
I don't have to because he'll be back.

345
00:20:06,425 --> 00:20:07,924
What?

346
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:10,124
I believe him.

347
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,624
But the locomotive broke.

348
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,725
If it broke, all I do is fix it.

349
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,825
I'm sorry.

350
00:20:32,225 --> 00:20:36,125
My late wife used to talk a lot about that day, too.

351
00:20:41,225 --> 00:20:43,724
No, it can't be.

352
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:46,925
You haven't changed at all, since 10 years ago.

353
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:49,525
What on earth...

354
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:19,124
If he goes to the police at this point,

355
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,124
he would be turning himself in.

356
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,625
You were really lenient to this perp, weren't you?

357
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,925
I guess so.

358
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:55,524
All right.

359
00:22:55,525 --> 00:22:58,924
Officer Takagi, please rush over to Mr. Nagai's shop.

360
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:00,524
-Yes, sir. -Officer Sato,

361
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:02,724
I want you to continue your investigation on Kuromaru Finance.

362
00:23:02,725 --> 00:23:04,924
If it's a fact that they are conducting malicious debt collection,

363
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,924
check them out thoroughly.

364
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:08,125
Yes, sir.

365
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:13,024
Then, Mr. Nagai, please come to the station.

366
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,324
Yes, sir.

367
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:17,124
It's not for me to say,

368
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:20,024
but what made you decide to turn yourself in?

369
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:23,024
A wonder boy appeared.

370
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:25,224
A wonder boy?

371
00:23:25,225 --> 00:23:26,225
Yes.

372
00:23:26,226 --> 00:23:30,824
He looked exactly the same as he did 10 years ago.

373
00:23:30,825 --> 00:23:31,925
He could've...

374
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,224
He could've been a messenger

375
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:40,425
sent from my wife in the heavens.

376
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,524
"Next Episode" -Conan.

377
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:46,324
This forest really look like zombies would appear

378
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:49,225
and is kind of creepy, isn't it?

379
00:23:51,925 --> 00:23:53,924
This... this is...

380
00:23:53,925 --> 00:23:55,324
the sword that Yoko was talking about.

381
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:58,824
The cursed sword that turns zombies that touch it into ashes.

382
00:23:58,825 --> 00:24:00,825
Mr. Harawaki.

383
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:05,925
Let's go and get out of here already!

384
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:08,524
Next Conan,

385
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:12,125
"A Villa Surrounded by Zombies (Part 1)"
