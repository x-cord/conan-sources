1
00:00:01,891 --> 00:00:05,291
Huh? You got a letter from a dead person?

2
00:00:05,291 --> 00:00:08,091
-For Heiji? -Yeah.

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,791
That person is my mother's acquaintance.

4
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,391
A person named Wakamatsu

5
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:15,491
who is the president of a design company in Tokyo.

6
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:18,091
I've met him several times before too,

7
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:22,791
but it seems he was killed at a villa in Karuizawa.

8
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,491
-Killed? -Yeah.

9
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:26,791
But it just so happened that

10
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,691
we were having a birthday party for Mr. Wakamatsu's wife

11
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:31,491
that day at the villa.

12
00:00:31,491 --> 00:00:32,791
The local police seems to think that

13
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:36,991
a robber who broke into the villa encountered Mr. Wakamatsu,

14
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:40,191
and as a result ended up killing him.

15
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:43,691
But, why would he send you a letter, Heiji?

16
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:46,991
Don't tell me that he sent it out before he was killed?

17
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:47,991
No.

18
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:51,691
That letter is post marked 10 days after the crime,

19
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:54,091
so I don't think he's the one who sent it out.

20
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:57,291
The name of the sender is Kohei Wakamatsu,

21
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,891
but the contents of the letter

22
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:01,291
seems to have been written by the culprit who killed him.

23
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,391
-The culprit? -Yeah.

24
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:06,091
This is what is written in the letter.

25
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:09,091
"Dear Heiji Hattori.

26
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:12,591
I would like to see you, Mr. High School Detective

27
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:16,291
and confess the crime that I have committed.

28
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,391
But, even if I were to meet you,

29
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:22,091
I feel slightly doubtful whether you'd be able to visibly see me or not.

30
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:26,291
Why? Because I am a warped entity

31
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,991
that you people have made up on your own.

32
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:29,291
I'm an illusionary figure

33
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,691
that one cannot visibly see under normal circumstances.

34
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,491
Despite this, if you'd still like to see me,

35
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:36,591
I'll be waiting for you at the residence of the man

36
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:39,791
that I have killed during the night of the next full moon.

37
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,391
And, at the end of the letter,

38
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:46,391
Mr. Wakamatsu's address in Osaka is written."

39
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:48,091
And along with...

40
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:53,691
the key of the house was inside, too!

41
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:16,391
If all cases were men,

42
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:17,991
all hidden mysteries are women.

43
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:19,991
Heiji receives a letter and a key.

44
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:21,991
The mystery of the word that is carved on the tile!

45
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:23,591
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:25,391
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:27,591
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:03:52,785 --> 00:03:58,585
"Design of Poison and Illusion (Eye)"

49
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:01,187
And?

50
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:02,287
Did you go to the house

51
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:04,387
where that ghost-like guy was waiting for you?

52
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:07,687
Of course I was planning to go and disclose his identity.

53
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:09,687
But I caught a cold.

54
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:12,387
Then she, without my permission took the key.

55
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:14,687
I went there in your place, Heiji!

56
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,487
-What? -You mean you went to

57
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:18,287
the haunted house all by yourself, Kazuha?

58
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:21,387
No. I took three friends along with me!

59
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,487
I persuaded them to come

60
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:24,487
saying that it was a game to test their courage.

61
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:27,487
Besides, it wasn't anything like a haunted house!

62
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:28,887
It seems that the late president

63
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:32,487
used to return to the house when he came back to Osaka.

64
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:34,687
The house was clean and neat, too.

65
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,887
The electricity was usable, too.

66
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:40,387
And? Was somebody waiting at that house?

67
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:43,387
Nope, there was no answer when we rang the doorbell.

68
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:45,587
So having no choice, I opened the door using the key

69
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:46,987
that I had with me and went inside,

70
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,587
but it was really fancy inside.

71
00:04:49,587 --> 00:04:50,887
So although we went there thinking that

72
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:52,387
we were going to be testing our courage,

73
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:53,787
it turned out to be a visit to a gorgeous villa!

74
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:57,187
We decided to check out what the bath room looked like

75
00:04:57,187 --> 00:04:59,687
and went to see it.

76
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:01,287
You took a look and?

77
00:05:01,287 --> 00:05:03,987
An eerie looking long-haired person

78
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:07,087
was leaning against the wall of the bath room and sitting down!

79
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:08,487
What?

80
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:10,587
Did you talk to that person?

81
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:13,387
Before I even got a chance to talk to that person,

82
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:15,387
the lights went out.

83
00:05:15,387 --> 00:05:17,087
I was talking over with my friends

84
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:19,687
whether we should call the police or not.

85
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,887
Then, we heard an eerie rustling noise.

86
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:25,187
We got scared and decided to leave the house right away then,

87
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:27,087
the lights suddenly turned back on.

88
00:05:27,087 --> 00:05:30,687
And the person who there a moment ago was gone!

89
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:35,487
I'm sure the guy got away

90
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:37,587
after turning the lights off with remote control or something.

91
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,987
Well, if he's the only one who disappeared,

92
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:42,687
I wouldn't have come all the way to Tokyo!

93
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:44,187
There was a letter left behind at the bath room

94
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:45,987
where the guy disappeared.

95
00:05:45,987 --> 00:05:47,287
A letter?

96
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:51,087
This is what seems to have been typed by a word processor.

97
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:53,387
"The only thing that disappeared is your physical body

98
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,787
and not the words!"

99
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:58,487
Words? What do you mean?

100
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:02,087
On the tile wall that the guy was leaning against, near his head,

101
00:06:02,087 --> 00:06:04,987
it seems that there was a carving by a knife of something.

102
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:07,287
-Isn't that right? -Yep.

103
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:09,387
It was written in three letter of the alphabet.

104
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:12,987
Spelled "E-Y-E" was written largely!

105
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:16,487
E-Y-E?

106
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:18,287
Eye.

107
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:19,887
Eye...

108
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:22,687
Those letters disappeared along with the person,

109
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:23,687
and yet on the piece of paper it was written

110
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:25,587
that the word didn't disappear.

111
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:29,187
Then, maybe the tile was switched with a tile

112
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:31,487
from another place where there was no carving?

113
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:35,387
There were a lot of scratches on the bottom part of the tile wall.

114
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:37,887
Although I thought the same thing at first...

115
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:38,887
As for that tile,

116
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:41,187
the more you go from the top of the wall to below,

117
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:43,187
the color gradually got paler.

118
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:46,187
So if you switched the top tiles to those below,

119
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:48,787
it'd be obvious because the color would be different!

120
00:06:48,787 --> 00:06:52,087
Did you go to see the tile too, Heiji?

121
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:53,287
Yeah.

122
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,387
But that house was scheduled for rebuilding construction from that day

123
00:06:56,387 --> 00:06:59,387
and there were a lot of workers there.

124
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:01,787
They wouldn't let me inside the house.

125
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:05,787
Then, how long were the lights out in that house?

126
00:07:05,787 --> 00:07:09,487
I think it lasted only less than 5 minutes.

127
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:12,287
If so, maybe a tile of the same color as the one

128
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:15,487
with the word carved on it was prepared beforehand.

129
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:17,387
I guess it'd be appropriate to think that

130
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:19,187
the guy switched the tiles in the dark

131
00:07:19,187 --> 00:07:22,887
and took the tile with the word on it away with him.

132
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:25,987
But, why try such a stupid trick?

133
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,787
It's only natural to think that way, right?

134
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:30,487
But now we're getting to the main issue.

135
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:33,287
Mr. Wakamatsu who was stabbed to death in Karuizawa

136
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,987
was also found in a bath room with the same kind of tile,

137
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:38,487
but when he was first found,

138
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:42,487
there was a dying message that he had written in his own blood.

139
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:45,987
However, it seems when the police got there, it was gone.

140
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:50,187
A dying message disappeared?

141
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:52,887
There was blood on Mr. Wakamatsu's fingers

142
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:55,487
and it's obvious that he had written something,

143
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:57,287
so don't you think it's strange?

144
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:59,387
Could it be that the culprit who noticed it,

145
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:01,787
snuck back and wiped it off?

146
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:04,487
If so, there luminol reaction should've been found from the tiles

147
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:06,887
around Mr. Wakamatsu's fingers, right?

148
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,787
Then, maybe like the person that Kazuha and her friends saw,

149
00:08:09,787 --> 00:08:12,487
the tiles were switched with ones that had no blood on them?

150
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:13,987
Well, just at that time,

151
00:08:13,987 --> 00:08:17,987
Mr. Wakamatsu was in the midst of redoing the tiles himself,

152
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:20,687
and the glue didn't seem to have dried completely yet.

153
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:23,287
So, the tiles could've been switched.

154
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:25,387
But there it was the same as what Kazuha saw,

155
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:28,587
and the tiles gradually got paler towards the bottom.

156
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:32,587
So, if they were switched, it would be readily visible.

157
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:36,587
If that culprit erased the word using the same trick that Kazuha saw,

158
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:39,587
-wouldn't that be of concern? -Yes! It would!

159
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:43,687
So, I had Mom get me to go to Mr. Wakamatsu's main house in Tokyo

160
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:47,887
to ask about the incident,

161
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:49,587
but would you guy like to come along too?

162
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:51,787
Then, can I come along too?

163
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:55,187
Sorry, I promised that only five of us would go!

164
00:08:55,187 --> 00:08:56,887
What?

165
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:01,787
It's better for you this way, right?

166
00:09:01,787 --> 00:09:03,487
Sort of.

167
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,287
-Shoots. -Sorry about that.

168
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:08,987
My...

169
00:09:08,987 --> 00:09:12,587
So, you're Shizuka's son, Heiji?

170
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:14,587
Is this the first time we've met?

171
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,887
Yeah.

172
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:19,687
My husband's always told me about you.

173
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:23,087
He used to say that you're really sharp despite your age.

174
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:25,587
He said that you're probably a good match

175
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:28,587
with another high school detective called Shinichi Kudo!

176
00:09:32,387 --> 00:09:36,387
Well, if you ask me, this famous Detective Kogoro Mouri,

177
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:39,987
their battle is like the kettle calling the black pot!

178
00:09:42,187 --> 00:09:44,187
Hey, is dinner ready yet?

179
00:09:44,187 --> 00:09:45,487
Ikuro.

180
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:47,487
I'm famished and on the verge of starving to death,

181
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:50,387
where's dinner?

182
00:09:50,387 --> 00:09:52,387
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:54,787
The housekeeper went out to get some soy sauce,

184
00:09:54,787 --> 00:09:56,587
so wait a little while more, okay?

185
00:09:56,587 --> 00:09:58,687
Then, tell her this when she gets back!

186
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:02,487
To give me a bigger serving of dinner than the others!

187
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:06,487
-Is he your son? -Yes.

188
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:10,287
But I'm his step-mother, you see.

189
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:12,687
We remarried.

190
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:17,087
Oh? Guests?

191
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:19,287
He's the detective I told you about the other day

192
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:21,387
and his company.

193
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,387
I see.

194
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:25,487
But so many...

195
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:26,987
Is anything wrong?

196
00:10:26,987 --> 00:10:28,487
Oh, no.

197
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:32,887
I bought some baumkuchen that's the president's favorite,

198
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:34,987
but I don't think there are enough pieces.

199
00:10:34,987 --> 00:10:36,887
I guess it'll be fine,

200
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:40,787
because the president's dead and not here anymore.

201
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:42,887
I tasted a bit of it a while ago,

202
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:44,187
so I don't want any either.

203
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:46,087
Hey, Fujinami!

204
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:48,387
Uh, who are these people?

205
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:50,487
This is Mr. Masashige Shiina,

206
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:52,687
the head of our business affairs office

207
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:56,587
and chief designer, Mr. Sumio Fujinami!

208
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:59,287
Is Ms. Satake here?

209
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:00,487
Oh, yes.

210
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:03,787
Ikuro seems to be annoyed because he's hungry.

211
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:06,387
I think having some baumkuchen may calm him down,

212
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:08,087
so could you serve us some tea?

213
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:09,787
Sure.

214
00:11:09,787 --> 00:11:11,187
Will the Prince of Wales brand

215
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:14,987
that the president used to like be all right?

216
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:16,387
Yes, that'll be fine.

217
00:11:16,387 --> 00:11:19,387
I'll do so right away, ma'am.

218
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,687
Who is that woman?

219
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:22,387
She's Ms. Yoshimi Satake,

220
00:11:22,387 --> 00:11:24,187
who used to be my husband's secretary.

221
00:11:24,187 --> 00:11:27,387
But she works as my secretary now.

222
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:31,187
Since everyone who was at the villa

223
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:34,187
when my husband died is here except for the housekeeper,

224
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:38,187
so shall we talk over the day of the incident in the living room?

225
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:45,087
Did your husband like to do Sunday carpentry?

226
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:47,987
Yes. That's why despite my birthday party that day,

227
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:51,487
he said since they were tiles that he designed himself

228
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:53,987
and special ordered that he wanted to redo it himself.

229
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:56,487
Well, I don't think that president even imagined

230
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:58,387
something like that would happen to him, though.

231
00:11:58,387 --> 00:12:00,087
Mr. Fujinami!

232
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,787
Yes, siree.

233
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:05,287
And, who first discovered his body?

234
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:07,087
That was...

235
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:08,487
Me!

236
00:12:08,487 --> 00:12:11,587
I went to the bath room thinking to help master,

237
00:12:11,587 --> 00:12:14,887
and found him lying on the floor smeared with blood.

238
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:16,287
I'm sorry.

239
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:17,887
I heard voices, so...

240
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:19,987
She's the housekeeper, Ms. Yonehara.

241
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:23,687
Then, you're the one who also saw the dying message in question?

242
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:25,487
Yes, sir.

243
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:28,187
And? What was written?

244
00:12:28,187 --> 00:12:30,987
If you saw it before it disappeared, you remember, don't you?

245
00:12:30,987 --> 00:12:33,587
Yes. If I remember correctly, it was written in alphabet.

246
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,987
Enough of that already!

247
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:38,287
It's going to spoil the taste of the baumkuchen!

248
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:40,987
Come on, cut it for me, will you?

249
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:42,787
Yes, sir.

250
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:44,787
I'm the one who should be doing the cutting!

251
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:46,787
Then, you cut the pieces, Ms. Yonehara.

252
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:48,087
And I'll put them on the plate.

253
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:49,887
-More than that... -Yes.

254
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:53,087
Since all the major members of the company are here,

255
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:55,687
let's talk about the next would-be president!

256
00:12:58,187 --> 00:12:59,487
Right now, Mom,

257
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,087
the vice-president is serving as temporary substitute president,

258
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:06,787
but how about jumping a flight of stairs and appointing me as president?

259
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,587
Although I'm just an ordinary employee now,

260
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,487
I'm going to eventually take after my Dad

261
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:14,387
and become the president.

262
00:13:14,387 --> 00:13:18,387
That's right, isn't it, Mother?

263
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:21,087
Yes.

264
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:23,687
No problem, then!

265
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:26,687
Make me president!

266
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:30,487
That's most likely what my late Dad wants too.

267
00:13:31,787 --> 00:13:35,487
Hey! Don't eat it before it's put on the plate.

268
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:38,287
Idiot! Eating it like this is...

269
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:53,187
Ikuro!

270
00:13:53,687 --> 00:13:54,787
Ikuro!

271
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:56,987
Don't move!

272
00:13:56,987 --> 00:14:00,087
Until I, the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri tell you it's okay,

273
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:02,387
don't anybody move!

274
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:03,787
But...

275
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:06,987
these two young men have already...

276
00:14:06,987 --> 00:14:09,487
No good. He's already dead.

277
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:10,987
-What? -What?

278
00:14:10,987 --> 00:14:13,787
It seems to be a cyanide hydrogen type of toxin.

279
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:15,087
Which means that

280
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:18,787
it could've been in the baumkuchen that he ate a while ago.

281
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:20,487
Ran and the others!

282
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:23,287
Don't eat the baumkuchen that was served a while ago, okay?

283
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:25,187
Yeah.

284
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:26,587
Kazuha, get on the phone!

285
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:29,387
-And call the police? -Yeah!

286
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:32,287
Tell them that the idiot who had the nerve to kill a person

287
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,287
right in front of a detective is here!

288
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:45,183
The victim is Ikuro Wakamatsu, age 25.

289
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:47,183
He's the son of company president Kyohei Wakamatsu

290
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:50,783
of a design company who died last month in Karuizawa.

291
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:53,183
Is that correct?

292
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,383
Yes.

293
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:58,983
But, just when was the poison put into the baumkuchen?

294
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:00,983
I don't know when,

295
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,683
but it seems that the poison was put into a capsule.

296
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:05,783
-Huh? -See.

297
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:09,583
There's a capsule like thing at the bottom of the teacup!

298
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,383
Though it's pretty melted.

299
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:16,083
The culprit probably cracked the capsule

300
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,783
and sprinkled the poison onto the baumkuchen,

301
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,083
and while we were distracted by the corpse,

302
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,583
he sunk the capsule into the teacup.

303
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,983
Once it melts, you can't get fingerprints from it.

304
00:15:26,983 --> 00:15:28,283
Which means that

305
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:31,883
the person who was near the teacup is the culprit?

306
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:34,683
But when everyone was told to stay away from the corpse,

307
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,683
everybody gathered over to this table.

308
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:40,583
So anybody who was in this room at that time

309
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:44,783
could've put the capsule with the poison inside the cup, no?

310
00:15:44,783 --> 00:15:46,783
It... It's not me!

311
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:50,783
I didn't go near the baumkuchen even once.

312
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,783
Moreover, that teacup is mine.

313
00:15:54,683 --> 00:15:57,383
Then, who cut the baumkuchen into divided pieces?

314
00:15:57,383 --> 00:16:00,183
I'm the one who cut it.

315
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:01,583
As for putting the pieces on the plate,

316
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,083
I had Ms. Satake help me.

317
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,383
I cut the baumkuchen into 8 pieces as she told me.

318
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,483
Divide into eight?

319
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:10,983
I wanted it divided into eight because there are 5 guests,

320
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:13,583
Mrs. Wakamatsu, and her son Ikuro.

321
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:19,183
Plus Mr. Shiina, the managing director who loves sweets.

322
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:22,283
The managing director's the one who bought the baumkuchen,

323
00:16:22,283 --> 00:16:24,083
and I thought that if we cut it into more pieces,

324
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,883
the pieces would be too small.

325
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:28,783
So you're the one who bought it?

326
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:30,283
Yes, sir.

327
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:34,883
The late president and I loved the baumkuchen of that shop,

328
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:37,283
so I always bring it along when I come here.

329
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:39,683
I had Mr. Fujinami stop by

330
00:16:39,683 --> 00:16:41,983
at the shop on our way here by car today, too.

331
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,383
Come to think of it,

332
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:47,083
you were saying that you picked on the baumkuchen, didn't you?

333
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,983
I just took a really small piece!

334
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:52,683
I was in the car and waiting in front of the cake shop

335
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:55,983
when the managing director handed me the box of baumkuchen

336
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:58,383
saying that he forgot to get the receipt

337
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:00,983
and went back into the shop.

338
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:03,283
So, I just got a bit playful while waiting

339
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:05,483
-and picked on a little piece. -Right!

340
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,683
Mine was a little broken off!

341
00:17:07,683 --> 00:17:08,883
In other words,

342
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:14,183
you could've sprinkled poison on the entire baumkuchen?

343
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:16,583
Then, are you saying that the poison

344
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,583
was sprinkled on the entire baumkuchen,

345
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:22,183
and that Ikuro just happened to eat it before the others?

346
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:24,183
No, it was a logical consequence!

347
00:17:24,183 --> 00:17:26,883
It seems that Ikuro was really hungry, you see.

348
00:17:26,883 --> 00:17:29,583
But even if it were to be so,

349
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,883
it wouldn't be necessary to drop the capsule into the teacup then.

350
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:36,883
-It's fake! -Fake?

351
00:17:36,883 --> 00:17:40,383
It was set to make it look as if the poison was sprinkled on here,

352
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:42,883
so that the one who couldn't come near the baumkuchen

353
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:44,383
wouldn't be suspected.

354
00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:45,783
Isn't that right?

355
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:48,183
If so, would I from my side go

356
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:49,883
and tell you that I picked on it?

357
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:54,283
Besides, after we got here and I was parking the car into the garage,

358
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:56,683
the managing director took the baumkuchen into the house first,

359
00:17:56,683 --> 00:18:00,383
so he also had the chance to lace it with poison.

360
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:01,583
In the first place,

361
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,983
we didn't know that the stupid brat was hungry,

362
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,683
so why would we do something as crazy as

363
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:09,083
to sprinkle poison over the entire baumkuchen?

364
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,883
I mean, if someone else ate it first,

365
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:12,883
that person would die, right?

366
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:17,283
By the way, why was Ikuro so hungry?

367
00:18:17,283 --> 00:18:19,183
I went out to buy soy sauce that we ran out of,

368
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,683
so dinner was delayed.

369
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,483
Who else knew that he was hungry?

370
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:28,283
The secretary Ms. Satake, Ms. Yonehara the housekeeper,

371
00:18:28,283 --> 00:18:30,283
and I could've all figured out that he was hungry, no?

372
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:31,983
Yes.

373
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:34,983
If I remember correctly, Ikuro grabbed 1 piece of baumkuchen

374
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:38,683
out of the two that were on the tray and ate it.

375
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:40,983
-But does he always eat like that? -Yes.

376
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:42,683
He says that it tastes better that way.

377
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:45,283
So he doesn't use a fork even when he eats shortcake.

378
00:18:45,283 --> 00:18:47,383
Don't tell me that somebody who wanted

379
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:48,583
to make Ikuro who was greedy over food,

380
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,883
take a big piece, cut a bit piece

381
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:52,283
and sprinkled poison on that piece?

382
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:54,783
I cut it into 8 even pieces!

383
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:56,183
The pieces that I served all of you

384
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:59,283
were cut into same size pieces, weren't they?

385
00:18:59,283 --> 00:19:02,483
At any rate, we're going to be checking

386
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:05,383
the left-over baumkuchen and teacups in detail from now,

387
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:07,883
so after you're done having your body checked,

388
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:10,583
please wait in another room.

389
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:14,983
But, what shall I do?

390
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:17,683
The deadline for the orders of the designs we received

391
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:19,883
is at the end of this month,

392
00:19:19,883 --> 00:19:22,683
and yet after what happened to Ikuro...

393
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:26,183
At this rate, I guess we won't be able to go home tonight.

394
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:27,483
No joke.

395
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:29,783
And I've still got unfinished work to take care of.

396
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:31,383
I also have a document

397
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:33,883
that I need you to sign and seal, vice-president.

398
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:37,083
And I sent the characters, colors and designs

399
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,683
that were chosen to the computer here,

400
00:19:39,683 --> 00:19:41,583
but did you take a look at it?

401
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,083
I told you to print things like that out

402
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,783
and then show it to me, didn't I?

403
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,383
I'm sorry.

404
00:19:46,383 --> 00:19:49,883
The president used to tell me to do so, that's why I...

405
00:19:49,883 --> 00:19:52,983
The computer here has a different operating system from mine,

406
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,183
so I can't use it.

407
00:19:55,183 --> 00:19:56,683
Well, I'll look at it on the monitor together

408
00:19:56,683 --> 00:19:58,183
with the managing director later,

409
00:19:58,183 --> 00:19:59,683
so let me know which file it is!

410
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:02,583
-Yes, ma'am. -Talking of the president...

411
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:06,583
What that stupid son of his said a while ago, was he serious?

412
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:09,183
About him taking over the company eventually

413
00:20:09,183 --> 00:20:11,083
because he was blood related to the president?

414
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,083
-I was also surprised. -Me too.

415
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:18,583
I wonder... I think he just believed that it would be so.

416
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,283
Either way, I had no intention

417
00:20:21,283 --> 00:20:23,683
to work under that stupid son, so thank God.

418
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:25,183
Hey, you guys!

419
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,283
Please, that's enough!

420
00:20:27,283 --> 00:20:30,783
A person has passed away, you know!

421
00:20:30,783 --> 00:20:34,183
It's true that Ikuro wasn't much liked by everyone,

422
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:37,183
but it's a fact that he was killed by someone!

423
00:20:37,183 --> 00:20:40,783
Moreover, the one who killed him could be among us, do you get it?

424
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:41,883
Will you all please be more considerate of

425
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:43,683
the situation that we're under right now?

426
00:20:45,783 --> 00:20:47,983
Do you understand the situation at all?

427
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:49,583
Serving everyone tea again

428
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,783
when somebody was poisoned to death.

429
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:55,383
I served the tea while the officer was looking on!

430
00:20:55,383 --> 00:20:58,683
If you still think that there's poison in it, don't drink it!

431
00:20:58,683 --> 00:20:59,883
Why you...

432
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:03,383
We were only part way through that story in question.

433
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:04,683
The story in question?

434
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:07,583
The one about the case last month where the president was killed

435
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,983
and found in the bath room of his villa in Karuizawa.

436
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:12,783
You were the first one to find him, weren't you?

437
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:14,583
Yes.

438
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,483
Back then, there should've been a dying message

439
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:20,183
that the president wrote with his own blood.

440
00:21:20,183 --> 00:21:23,583
But when the police got there, it was gone, right?

441
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,083
If I remember correctly,

442
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,583
you said that you remember that word that disappeared.

443
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,783
I remember you said something about it being an alphabet.

444
00:21:30,783 --> 00:21:33,883
Don't tell me that the alphabets were...

445
00:21:33,883 --> 00:21:36,283
"E-Y-E"?

446
00:21:36,283 --> 00:21:38,283
E-Y-E?

447
00:21:38,283 --> 00:21:40,683
It's probably referring to "eyes"!

448
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:42,183
I saw it, too!

449
00:21:42,183 --> 00:21:44,683
I was contacted by the culprit who said he killed the president,

450
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:47,183
who told me to come to the president's residence in Osaka.

451
00:21:47,183 --> 00:21:49,983
That's when I saw the eerie three letters that disappeared!

452
00:21:49,983 --> 00:21:52,783
My... At that house in Osaka?

453
00:21:52,783 --> 00:21:56,383
That's why we came all the way out here to hear more about it.

454
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:59,883
But, what I saw was...

455
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:02,083
the alphabet "S"!

456
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,083
There seemed to be continuation of something else,

457
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,583
but it covered by his hand and I couldn't see it.

458
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,483
"S", was it?

459
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:10,283
Hey! Hold it!

460
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:12,883
The managing director Mr. Masashige Shiina

461
00:22:12,883 --> 00:22:15,783
as well as Chief designer Mr. Masuo Fujinami,

462
00:22:15,783 --> 00:22:17,883
the secretary Ms. Yoshiimi Satake,

463
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:20,883
and the president's wife Mrs. Serika Wakamatsu,

464
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:24,283
all have either names or last names

465
00:22:24,283 --> 00:22:27,183
starting with the letter "S"!

466
00:22:27,183 --> 00:22:31,783
My name is Sakurako, so it also starts with "S".

467
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,183
What?

468
00:22:33,183 --> 00:22:36,383
The dying message that disappeared...

469
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:38,083
The letter "S" written with blood,

470
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,783
what on earth are they indicating?

471
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:03,483
"Next Episode" -Isn't the officer with the wounded eye

472
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:06,183
that we met during the Fuurinkazan incident there?

473
00:24:06,183 --> 00:24:09,183
Oh, you mean Inspector Kansuke Yamato.

474
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:13,483
I heard nothing of the tile at the crime site being like this.

475
00:24:13,483 --> 00:24:15,383
The day the case was closed,

476
00:24:15,383 --> 00:24:19,383
Yui seemed to have confessed to Inspector Yamato, besides.

477
00:24:19,383 --> 00:24:20,783
It's strange that after she confessed,

478
00:24:20,783 --> 00:24:23,683
nothing occurred after that!

479
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:31,283
Next Conan, "Design of Poison and Illusion (S)"

480
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:49,483
Next Conan's Hint:

481
00:24:49,483 --> 00:24:51,383
"Tile"

482
00:24:51,383 --> 00:24:53,283
It seems that people are excited over gifts over the phone.

483
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,183
This week King Kazu is appearing on our show!
