1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,499
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,299
They can be the culprit or the actor.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,999
The Osaka duo watch a magic show.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,499
Off stage, however, a life-taking trap is set up.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,999
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,899
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,300
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,519
Yes, so we're gonna go and see that with these people right now.

9
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,819
Oh, that sounds amazing!

10
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,019
Okay, to go to that hall,

11
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,620
you need to go straight down this street and then...

12
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,519
Why...

13
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,420
Man, it's stressing me out.

14
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,120
Guess who I am?

15
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,219
-Hey! Stop it! -It's me!

16
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,420
Stop it! I'm serious! Kudo!

17
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,520
So you know, Ran.

18
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,320
Hey, Hattori!

19
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,319
You want me to do the Judo throw on you?

20
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,720
Heiji?

21
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,620
Well...

22
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,820
Hey, Hattori.

23
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,720
"Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (Tricks)"

24
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,920
I'm so sorry, Ran! For asking you a big favor.

25
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,819
Hattori, what brings you here?

26
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,120
Is it the Dogo Hoshikawa's Super Magic Show?

27
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,519
She said "I feel like watching miracles".

28
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,119
So I had to come for this stupid girl's stupid tricks.

29
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,219
Don't call me stupid, stupid!

30
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,220
Huh?

31
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,019
Kazuha, they are over there.

32
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,320
Now, let's go! Conan.

33
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,720
"Dogo Hoshikawa's Illusion Magic Show."

34
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,119
Hey, it's here. Hurry up, Ran!

35
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,819
There are a lot of young people here, don't you think?

36
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,620
Are there?

37
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,519
I see, so he is Dogo Hoshikawa.

38
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,119
That's right! Don't you think he is handsome, Ran?

39
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,320
He's not just a handsome guy but also a great magician!

40
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,820
"Illusion Magic Show."

41
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,019
She's a hot girl, huh?

42
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,220
Yes.

43
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,119
What? I thought he was hanging on strings.

44
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,120
That's what I thought too.

45
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,019
It's amazing.

46
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,520
Is it?

47
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,419
No way.

48
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,920
He vanished.

49
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,419
It's unbelievable.

50
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,419
He must be a wizard.

51
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,820
Are you stupid?

52
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,519
There's no such thing called a wizard.

53
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,519
I think so too.

54
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,819
That cage looks impossible to escape from,

55
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,819
but it actually has a door in the back.

56
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,719
So, after the cloth covers the cage, he goes out through the backdoor.

57
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,419
We didn't see him anywhere on the stage though!

58
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,019
The girl assistants on the stage are the key to the trick.

59
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,419
Inside the cage, that magician probably changed his clothes

60
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,220
to the ones that the girls are wearing in order to camouflage himself.

61
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,719
Nobody was counting how many assistants were on the stage,

62
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,219
so we wouldn't know whether it was eight or nine assistants, right?

63
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,319
By walking closely with the female assistants,

64
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
he disappeared into the wing.

65
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:30,619
While people are watching the clothes burn up,

66
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,819
he comes to the audience seats!

67
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,820
Yes.

68
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,919
But the levitation magic was amazing, right?

69
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,919
It looked like he was really flying!

70
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,919
I didn't see any wire at all.

71
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,019
For that, he used a bar to hold his body in place,

72
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,620
and there was a crane behind the curtain to move the bar.

73
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,419
The curtain can be cut lengthwise and sideways.

74
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,519
The audience pays attention only to the magician above

75
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,019
who they think is being suspended in air by a wire.

76
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,719
Enough!

77
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,820
You guys speak no more!

78
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,519
For God's sake.

79
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,420
You're the ones who wanted to know how the tricks worked.

80
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,719
Now, it's time for today's last illusion.

81
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,020
It's just a little dangerous magic, "Escape from water"!

82
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,919
With both hands and feet handcuffed,

83
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,819
he will try to escape from this aquarium which is sealed with a chain.

84
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,120
Please give a big applause if he makes it through!

85
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,420
It's taking too long.

86
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,719
Ran, it's been almost 10 minutes

87
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,719
since he went into the water, right?

88
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Yes.

89
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,719
Close the curtain!

90
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,519
Somebody, bring an axe!

91
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,619
There has been a minor complication.

92
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,819
Please wait for a moment.

93
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,519
That's what the legendary magician Harry Houdini used to do.

94
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,319
Yes, that's too common in escape tricks.

95
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
-Let's go! Ran! -Yes!

96
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,320
They're gone, Hattori.

97
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,220
Excuse me!

98
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,020
You can't go in!

99
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,020
-You can't... -Get out of the way!

100
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,220
Ran! Break the aquarium with your karate!

101
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,919
Somehow, I made it.

102
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,219
To my luck,

103
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,519
and to these two brave ladies

104
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,719
who made this show even more exciting.

105
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,620
Please give them a warm hand.

106
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,119
Hey, Hattori.

107
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,720
Yes, what?

108
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,719
That wasn't a part of the show, right?

109
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,120
I don't know.

110
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:14,610
"Hoshikawa. Waiting Room"

111
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:17,010
-I'm so sorry! -I'm so sorry!

112
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:20,710
We just thought you were gonna die. Right, Ran?

113
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:23,211
Yes! I'm sorry.

114
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:25,510
Don't worry about it.

115
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:30,310
In fact, I'm still alive partly thanks to you ladies.

116
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:31,411
-Huh? -Huh?

117
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,410
"Dogo Hoshikawa (27), Magician" -I heard your voices

118
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:37,610
when I was half unconscious underwater.

119
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:40,511
Your love brought me back to life.

120
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,510
-Really? -Really?

121
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:44,411
He's telling a lie.

122
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:47,610
He was probably hiding a pin or something in his mouth

123
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:49,210
to unlock the handcuffs.

124
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:52,010
I guess he was out of the aquarium way before. What do you think?

125
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:56,910
Yes, people believe it's impossible to open the aquarium

126
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:59,610
since they saw it being sealed with a chain.

127
00:13:59,611 --> 00:14:02,510
But the truth is, some part of the cover has no chain on it.

128
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:05,510
And from that space, it is possible to escape.

129
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,010
All he needs is to wait behind the curtain

130
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:08,710
until the audience starts to worry.

131
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:10,910
As the staff give him the sign,

132
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:13,610
he pours water over his head and shows up.

133
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:17,611
Now, the great breathtaking-escape illusion is done!

134
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:23,910
Well, it was great, Hoshikawa.

135
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:26,010
"Riki Handa (41), Magician" -I was just thinking about you and I

136
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:28,210
doing some collaborative performance. What do you think?

137
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:30,910
Sure. If it's okay with you.

138
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,810
That would be a great help,

139
00:14:32,811 --> 00:14:35,311
since you're a popular man now.

140
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:40,111
Would you mind if I joined you guys?

141
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:44,511
We should make clear,

142
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:48,410
"Tenko Himemiya (32), Magician" -which one of us three

143
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:52,011
is the true heir of our master, Mr. Masakage.

144
00:14:53,611 --> 00:14:55,710
Mr. Masakage?

145
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:58,610
He was a mysterious magician who used to be on TV and stage

146
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:02,310
but disappeared all of a sudden about 10 years ago.

147
00:15:02,311 --> 00:15:06,310
I heard he's still alive somewhere.

148
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:08,110
Mr. Masakage.

149
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:12,411
I never knew these three people were Mr. Masakage's pupils.

150
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:14,910
Oh, yes!

151
00:15:14,911 --> 00:15:18,010
If we wanna perform together, then why don't we get Kazumi Sanada

152
00:15:18,011 --> 00:15:20,210
since he's as popular as Hoshikawa,

153
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,810
and name the event "Dream Collaboration of the Four Magic Kings"!

154
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:25,710
Kazumi Sanada?

155
00:15:25,711 --> 00:15:27,610
I wouldn't mind.

156
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:30,111
I don't know if he's up to it though.

157
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:34,410
We actually never met him before although we were in the same field.

158
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:38,010
Hey, Ran, you've met this Kazumi Sanada guy before, right?

159
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:42,110
Yes. First, it was when Sonoko invited me

160
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:44,610
at the cruise party for the Zaibatsu Suzuki's 60th anniversary.

161
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,410
Kid sent us a letter.

162
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:49,210
So for the entertainment at the party,

163
00:15:49,211 --> 00:15:52,311
Sonoko's mother hired Mr. Sanada to disguise as Kid.

164
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:56,710
I met him for the second time when Motoyasu Tsukumo,

165
00:15:56,711 --> 00:15:58,810
a genius magician's wife

166
00:15:58,811 --> 00:16:01,610
asked my dad to investigate the cause of his death.

167
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:05,810
Mr. Tsukumo had three pupils and Mr. Sanada was one of them.

168
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:09,610
Really? You never know who's connected to who.

169
00:16:09,611 --> 00:16:13,810
Then, we should ask this lady to get in touch with Sanada.

170
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:18,110
Now, I think we should head to master's house and talk.

171
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,510
How about you guys?

172
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,410
We could show you a simple magic show after dinner if you like.

173
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:25,311
-Oh, are you serious? -Can we do that?

174
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,410
But why his house?

175
00:16:29,411 --> 00:16:31,510
For God's sake, have you forgotten?

176
00:16:31,511 --> 00:16:34,711
Today is the day master disappeared 10 years ago.

177
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:39,711
He may just decide to return home today, you know?

178
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:47,010
"Masakage."

179
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:49,110
Oh, hello there!

180
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:50,310
"Mari Masakage (54), Wife of Mr. Masakage."

181
00:16:50,311 --> 00:16:53,810
Is it Tenko and Hoshikawa back there?

182
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:54,910
Hello.

183
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:56,410
Long time no see!

184
00:16:56,411 --> 00:16:59,810
It's been quite a while. I guess it's been what, 10 years?

185
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,910
Oh, sorry, who are those people?

186
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:03,910
They're our special guests tonight!

187
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:05,510
-Nice to you meet you! -Nice to you meet you!

188
00:17:05,511 --> 00:17:08,910
All right, I guess I should go and get some more groceries for tonight.

189
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,610
Oh no, don't.

190
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:12,511
We thought so...

191
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:14,610
so here it is!

192
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:15,811
I see.

193
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:20,210
So you've been visiting here the same date every year.

194
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:23,910
Yes, in anticipation that master might just come back.

195
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:28,010
Unfortunately, we've heard nothing from him these past 10 years.

196
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:30,410
Well, this brings back memories.

197
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:33,310
Yes, we used to live here together

198
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:35,710
and went through master's intensive training together.

199
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:39,110
Well, Hoshikawa, I think you used to drop by here

200
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:41,110
even before my husband decided to have pupils, right?

201
00:17:41,111 --> 00:17:44,510
Then, Mr. Hoshikawa is his first pupil.

202
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:47,310
It doesn't matter who's first and who's last.

203
00:17:47,311 --> 00:17:52,410
What matters is, who's surpasses master as a magician.

204
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:54,511
Hey, Tenko.

205
00:17:55,311 --> 00:17:58,710
If we're really going to do a show together,

206
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:02,811
the highlight of my magic will be "Witch Reborn"!

207
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:07,110
I'm gonna place a huge cross in the middle of the audience

208
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:10,310
and tie myself to it.

209
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:12,511
I'll have the audience fire it up,

210
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:16,810
and before the cross burns out, I'll vanish.

211
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:20,711
Next time you see me is when I emerge out of the ashes.

212
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:24,210
What do you think?

213
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:26,711
It's breathtaking and exciting, isn't it?

214
00:18:29,411 --> 00:18:31,910
I should start preparing dinner now.

215
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:35,010
Okay, let us help you then.

216
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:36,210
Sure!

217
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:40,010
I think I'll look around the house since it's been a while.

218
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:41,710
That's a good idea.

219
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:44,910
Actually, I'm gonna go to my room and take a nap.

220
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:46,910
I had to wake up early this morning.

221
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,711
All right. We'll call you when dinner is ready.

222
00:18:50,711 --> 00:18:53,710
Hattori, she just changed the atmosphere, didn't she?

223
00:18:53,711 --> 00:18:54,811
She did.

224
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:58,410
-Today, I'm going to... -What?

225
00:18:58,411 --> 00:19:02,710
You want me to call the magician, Kazumi Sanada?

226
00:19:02,711 --> 00:19:04,410
I can't do that!

227
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:07,210
I don't even know his phone number!

228
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:10,710
True. We only met him twice. I guess it's impossible.

229
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:13,210
Hey, Ran, where are you now?

230
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:15,410
I'm starving to death!

231
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:18,010
Sorry, dad, I think we'll be late.

232
00:19:18,011 --> 00:19:19,710
Why don't you eat in a restaurant?

233
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:22,211
Ran, I need you to help me!

234
00:19:24,111 --> 00:19:25,711
What? Hey!

235
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:28,410
Hey!

236
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:31,010
I just can't handle this all alone, Ran!

237
00:19:31,011 --> 00:19:33,610
What? Where is Mrs. Masakage?

238
00:19:33,611 --> 00:19:36,610
She went out to get some seasoning because we ran out,

239
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:39,510
and although it's been quite a while, she still hasn't come back.

240
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,411
I was gonna ask the boys for a help, but...

241
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:48,310
I can't do this.

242
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:51,010
This knife isn't as sharp as my deductions are.

243
00:19:51,011 --> 00:19:52,110
Yes.

244
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:53,710
I think cohesiveness is a necessary factor

245
00:19:53,711 --> 00:19:55,411
when it comes to deductions.

246
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:05,210
I guess we did all right.

247
00:20:05,211 --> 00:20:08,810
I made you two do all the work. I'm so sorry.

248
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:11,010
Oh, that's okay. Right?

249
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:12,210
Yes.

250
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,611
How's it coming?

251
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:17,411
It looks yummy.

252
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:20,910
Huh? Where're your friends?

253
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:24,210
-They're treating their wound in the kitchen. -What?

254
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:27,310
It seems one of them cut their finger with the knife.

255
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:30,210
Okay, I'll go and wake Handa up.

256
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:33,510
He usually will stay in the room way in the back of the first floor.

257
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:36,910
Hoshikawa, would you please go and get Tenko?

258
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:41,710
Sure. She's most probably in that room that I think she's in.

259
00:20:41,711 --> 00:20:43,110
Which room?

260
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:46,610
Oh, I mean Mr. Masakage's room.

261
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:50,110
There're pictures and instruments for old magic tricks there.

262
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:52,810
There are many memorable objects in that room.

263
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:55,010
-What? -Old magic tricks?

264
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:57,210
Would you like to take a look?

265
00:20:57,211 --> 00:20:59,511
-Yes! -Why not?

266
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:05,310
Mr. Masakage designed and built this house himself.

267
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:06,510
-I see. -I see.

268
00:21:06,511 --> 00:21:09,111
His room is on the second floor.

269
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:20,610
It's a narrow hallway.

270
00:21:20,611 --> 00:21:23,510
It's kinda dark and scary too.

271
00:21:23,511 --> 00:21:27,211
That door on the right is master's room.

272
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:36,211
Maybe the light bulb burned out.

273
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:40,911
-What is it? -A blackout?

274
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:42,611
Where's the breaker?

275
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:47,811
I guess it's not in this room.

276
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:52,010
Hi, Mrs. Masakage. Where's the breaker?

277
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,611
It's in the next room. In the bathroom.

278
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:00,511
Okay, I found it.

279
00:22:20,811 --> 00:22:22,411
-Hattori! -Yes!

280
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:26,511
What is it? What's going on?

281
00:23:57,911 --> 00:23:59,410
What the heck is this?

282
00:23:59,411 --> 00:24:01,510
Tell me, what is this room?

283
00:24:01,511 --> 00:24:06,110
Our master, Mr. Masakage traveled all around the world.

284
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,910
Those are the documents on magic that he collected.

285
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:11,110
This must be it. This is the Christmas tree magic.

286
00:24:11,111 --> 00:24:15,410
What do you mean? Don't you call me kid, you brat!

287
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:16,611
This picture.

288
00:24:17,311 --> 00:24:19,910
A picture of his three young pupils.

289
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:21,511
Maybe this is...

290
00:24:21,811 --> 00:24:23,210
Next Conan,

291
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:27,411
"Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (House)"

292
00:24:43,111 --> 00:24:45,110
Next Conan's Hint:

293
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:47,310
"Narrow hallway."

294
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:48,710
-Next week, we'll have a battle. -Yes.

295
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:52,311
-Oh, you mean a magic battle? -No! A deduction battle!
