1
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:13,636
That's good.

2
00:00:13,946 --> 00:00:15,506
Beer is great!

3
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:18,675
Dad, don't drink too much.

4
00:00:18,676 --> 00:00:19,966
I know.

5
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:23,395
Anyway, listen to this.

6
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:24,906
What is it?

7
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:26,955
It's about the other day.

8
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:28,656
What a masterpiece.

9
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:34,416
While heading home the other day, I saw a strange man in front of my house.

10
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:36,916
Totally suspicious, right?

11
00:00:37,846 --> 00:00:40,826
So I reported him to the police.

12
00:00:42,636 --> 00:00:45,755
You're calling me suspicious? That's ridiculous.

13
00:00:45,756 --> 00:00:48,575
I came to check on my coworker who lives in this apartment,

14
00:00:48,576 --> 00:00:51,676
but I forgot his room number, so I texted him.

15
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:56,186
Sorry about that. My mistake.

16
00:00:56,326 --> 00:00:59,186
You're the guy who should've minded his own business!

17
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,186
Can you believe that happened?

18
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:05,525
You sure do love to meddle in other people's business.

19
00:01:05,526 --> 00:01:08,696
I prefer to think of myself as considerate.

20
00:01:09,046 --> 00:01:13,906
Besides, it's his fault for behaving suspiciously.

21
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:22,185
Find the question that solves the mystery!

22
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:24,295
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

23
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:26,295
A small kindness becomes a major nuisance!

24
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:28,335
A man's meddling turns into a case!

25
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:29,925
Always determining the one truth

26
00:01:29,926 --> 00:01:31,735
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

27
00:01:31,736 --> 00:01:34,306
his name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:17,056
"Troublesome Kindness!"

29
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:24,870
Everyone should be grateful for my actions.

30
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,095
Kotani Shin (32) Restaurant Customer

31
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:29,845
By the way, something else happened to me the other day.

32
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:33,855
I was waiting in line to use the ATM

33
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:37,855
when I noticed a man behaving strangely.

34
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:43,365
He was standing in front of the ATM without using it while talking on the phone.

35
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,805
Yes, yes. I understand.

36
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:48,974
What? Next month, too?

37
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:51,064
Next month will be difficult.

38
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,625
Fine. I'll see what I can do.

39
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:56,934
I figured it must be phone fraud,

40
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:59,395
so I reported him to the police immediately.

41
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:04,084
This really isn't phone fraud.

42
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:07,505
My mother called me. It has nothing to do with this.

43
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:09,784
I was transferring money to my workplace.

44
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:11,815
So it was a mistake.

45
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:16,015
Kotani, what have you done?!

46
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:18,044
The other party hasn't receive the funds yet!

47
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:19,395
It's causing a huge problem!

48
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:21,364
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:23,605
You'll pay for this.

50
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,234
Can you believe what happened?

51
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:28,905
He's hardly fit to be a working member of society, don't you think?

52
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:31,194
I wouldn't go that far. (Yamanashi Hajime (30) Salaryman)

53
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:35,354
Guys like him don't get it until something that drastic happens to them.

54
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:37,295
That's awful.

55
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:45,755
Patient. Be patient.

56
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:47,755
What's his deal?

57
00:04:48,225 --> 00:04:49,535
What is it, kid?

58
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:51,485
Nothing.

59
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,585
He's just drunk.

60
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,364
Excuse me. Are you all right?

61
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:02,645
Yeah.

62
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:05,964
Excuse me. Could I get another beer?

63
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:06,885
Yes, sir.

64
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:10,024
Dad, if you get drunk, I'm leaving you here.

65
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:11,480
I'll be fine. Make it a large.

66
00:05:11,505 --> 00:05:13,644
Conan-kun, have you had some of this?

67
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:14,845
It's good.

68
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:17,165
Conan-kun?

69
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:26,024
Anyway, I'm a genuinely good guy.

70
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,925
I can't ignore someone who's in trouble.

71
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,450
I'll keep living my life in service of others...

72
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:35,424
Sir, shall I bring you some water?

73
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:38,904
No. Could I get another beer?

74
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,445
Okay, one beer.

75
00:05:45,865 --> 00:05:47,455
I'm going to the bathroom.

76
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:49,834
Take a right outside the restaurant.

77
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:50,825
I know.

78
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:03,085
Kotani

79
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,845
Mining Co.

80
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:24,535
It's an emergency!

81
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,775
Someone help!

82
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:28,885
Conan-kun.

83
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:37,585
What's the matter?

84
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:41,665
Kusano was taking a while to return, so I came here.

85
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,074
Ran, call an ambulance.

86
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:46,745
Okay.

87
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:48,044
And the police.

88
00:07:48,045 --> 00:07:49,145
Got it.

89
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:51,985
Damn. He's dead.

90
00:07:57,615 --> 00:07:58,725
No...

91
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:01,655
No way. No way!

92
00:08:02,305 --> 00:08:04,935
Wh-What's going on here?

93
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:15,429
Kusano-san was struck on both the front and back of the head.

94
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,419
The weapon is the deck brush next to the body.

95
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:24,069
For some reason, there's a roll of toilet paper stuck inside the hand drier.

96
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:27,399
There are signs of a struggle.

97
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,949
What's that?

98
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:33,699
Hey!

99
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:37,988
I'm always telling you not to wander around crime scenes.

100
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:39,929
Sorry.

101
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:56,268
Let's go over your story again.

102
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,838
Your coworker Kusano-san was spending a long time in the bathroom,

103
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,109
so you went to check on him, correct?

104
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:03,679
Yes.

105
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:07,648
I left the restaurant and was heading towards the bathroom

106
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:11,498
when I nearly ran into a man wearing a cap low over his eyes.

107
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:15,119
The man headed towards the stairs.

108
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:19,418
I ignored him and stopped in front of the bathroom.

109
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:23,338
I heard the hand drier running inside the bathroom,

110
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,349
so I thought Kusano would be coming out right away and waited for a while,

111
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:30,569
but he didn't come out.

112
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:33,978
You didn't see anyone other than that man?

113
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:36,499
No, I'm absolutely certain.

114
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,729
That man who passed by me must be the culprit.

115
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:42,899
If only I'd gotten a better look at his face.

116
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:52,408
Immediately after that, you heard Yamanashi-san's voice and came here, right?

117
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:57,008
Yeah. When we arrived, Yamanashi-san was sitting here.

118
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:00,789
I checked Kusano-san's pulse, but he was already dead.

119
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:05,048
Mori-san, you didn't see the man in the cap, did you?

120
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:08,549
There wasn't anyone here when we arrived.

121
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:11,078
What about you two, Ran-san and Conan-kun?

122
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:14,008
I didn't run into anyone on the way here.

123
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:17,608
I didn't see the man in the cap either.

124
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:18,559
I see.

125
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:23,688
We've started an emergency search for him and are gathering information in the area.

126
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,688
I hope we find some useful information.

127
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:31,319
Since his wallet is still here, it looks like the motive was a grudge and not theft.

128
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:35,869
Most likely. That's how we're investigating the case.

129
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:42,049
But what we don't understand concerns the elevator next to the bathroom.

130
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:48,389
Why did the culprit walk all the way to the stairs instead of using the elevator?

131
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,638
That's obvious.

132
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:55,978
If someone found Kusano-san while he was waiting for the elevator,

133
00:10:55,979 --> 00:10:57,099
he'd have nowhere to run.

134
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:03,068
But, Mori-kun, the culprit deliberately activated the hand drier before he fled.

135
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:05,258
Creating noise for a prolonged period of time

136
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:07,109
would mean someone would notice something was off sooner.

137
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:11,109
In other words, didn't he do it so the body would be discovered quickly?

138
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:12,869
I see.

139
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:18,239
If the culprit bothered to do that, that means...

140
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:19,959
That means...?

141
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:22,229
What does it mean?

142
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,948
If the culprit wanted to hang around the bathroom,

143
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:29,249
blending in with the customers at the various restaurants on this floor would be the natural choice.

144
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:34,259
The culprit could've used the confusion cause by the discovery of Kusano-san's body to flee.

145
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:39,639
None of the restaurants reported a customer wearing a cap.

146
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:45,139
So the man came here, attacked Kusano-san, and left.

147
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:49,218
And it doesn't make sense since he couldn't have known

148
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:50,649
when Kusano-san would go to the bathroom.

149
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:54,279
You don't know what you're talking about, kid.

150
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:57,158
No, he's right. It doesn't make sense.

151
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:00,848
Yes, Inspector. Now that you mention it, you're right.

152
00:12:00,849 --> 00:12:04,159
Perhaps it was an indiscriminate murder.

153
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:10,599
For the time being, we'll have to keep all manner of possibilities in mind.

154
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,619
Hey, mister forensics officer.

155
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:18,648
Did you retrieve the belongings that were in the drain?

156
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:20,309
Of course.

157
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:21,929
You mean this?

158
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:23,549
I knew it.

159
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:27,319
He's lying.

160
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:29,258
You brat!

161
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:31,939
How many times do I have to tell you not to scamper around?

162
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:34,229
Sorry.

163
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:37,239
Scamper, scamper.

164
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,638
Scamper, scamper.

165
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,788
Scamper away, little froggies.

166
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:42,349
Scamper away together.

167
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:44,928
Mori-kun?

168
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:45,999
Could it be?

169
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:49,389
Yes, indeed.

170
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,229
I've figured out the truth behind this case.

171
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,089
Allow me to be direct.

172
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:04,849
The culprit in this murder is the man who discovered the body, Yamanashi-san.

173
00:13:07,099 --> 00:13:11,359
Him? But what about the man wearing the cap?

174
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:13,329
No such man exists.

175
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,859
We were fooled by Yamanashi-san's lie.

176
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:22,448
You're lying!

177
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:23,808
What proof do you have?

178
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:25,539
I really did see him.

179
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:27,869
Allow me to explain.

180
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:33,638
It's possible that this case couldn't have been solved by anyone other than me,

181
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,549
who arrived just after Yamanashi-san.

182
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:41,179
In fact, one clue is disappearing as we speak.

183
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,219
A clue?

184
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:47,868
In order to cover the sound of Kusano-san's scream,

185
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,959
you attacked him the moment he put his hands inside the hand drier.

186
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,779
Then you activated the hand drier once again

187
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:09,289
so a third party would discover the body.

188
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:17,689
However, something unexpected occurred.

189
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:22,469
How could you?

190
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:29,209
You'll pay for this!

191
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:44,528
You believed the hand drier hadn't drowned out

192
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:47,889
the loud noises made during your scuffle,

193
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:57,249
so you hastily changed your plan and decided you'd discover the body.

194
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:02,108
It's an emergency!

195
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,509
Someone help!

196
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:08,279
Conan-kun.

197
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:14,429
What's the matter?

198
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:18,289
Kusano was taking a while to return, so I came here.

199
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,948
Ran, call an ambulance!

200
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:23,579
Okay.

201
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,878
And the police.

202
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:25,889
Got it.

203
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:28,909
Damn. He's dead.

204
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:39,299
Naturally, there's no man wearing a cap.

205
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:43,419
It's a lie you made up to confuse the investigation.

206
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,318
That's a false accusation.

207
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,368
How can you call someone a liar without any proof?

208
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:50,428
Do you have any proof?

209
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:55,099
The first piece of evidence I mentioned earlier is already disappearing.

210
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,578
When I saw you in front of the bathroom,

211
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:00,439
I felt as though something was off.

212
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,729
The cuff of your pants was wet,

213
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,578
probably because Kusano-san grabbed it when he woke up.

214
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:16,619
What?

215
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:20,008
What are you talking about?

216
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:22,208
That's just speculation.

217
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:23,209
This is nonsense.

218
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:25,388
Then allow me to confirm something.

219
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:30,728
When you opened the bathroom door, you were shocked to see Kusano-san on the floor.

220
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:32,489
Then you shouted for help.

221
00:16:33,219 --> 00:16:36,769
In other words, you haven't set foot inside the bathroom, correct?

222
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:38,008
That's right.

223
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:41,319
Maybe you just thought my pant cuffs were wet.

224
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:43,939
Look. They're not wet.

225
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:48,549
Now that they're dry, I can't prove it.

226
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:52,679
But what about your shirt sleeve button?

227
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,729
Shirt sleeve button?

228
00:16:56,219 --> 00:16:59,459
When did you lose that?

229
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,389
I...

230
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:07,569
Forensics recovered the button from the bathroom drain earlier.

231
00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:11,159
Hey, Mister Forensics Officer.

232
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:15,688
Did you retrieve the belongings that were in the drain?

233
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:17,319
Of course.

234
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:18,849
You mean this?

235
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:28,349
Kusano-san's body was covering the bathroom drain.

236
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:34,619
If you haven't set foot inside the bathroom, then how did your button get in there?

237
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:43,359
Yes, because that button came off during your scuffle with Kusano-san.

238
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,609
It proves you're the culprit.

239
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:53,208
Well, Yamanashi-san?

240
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:55,759
Why did you kill your coworker Kusano-san?

241
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,789
I hated him.

242
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:03,549
Because of his meddling...

243
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:08,864
My sister was coming home late from work one night

244
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:10,234
Help me!

245
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:14,319
when she happened to witness a phantom slasher stab someone to death.

246
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,749
The culprit pursued her.

247
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,946
She attempted to get help from a police box,

248
00:18:22,947 --> 00:18:23,864
(Out On Patrol)

249
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:28,629
but because of Kusano, the officers were out patrolling for a suspicious person.

250
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:36,618
(Murder Witness Dead)(Victim Yamanashi Akiho (25))

251
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:37,564
(The Victim Ran to a Police Box, but Officers Were Absent Due to Being on Patrol)

252
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:40,634
There was no one there to protect my sister.

253
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:44,978
When I learned it was Kusano's fault that my sister died,

254
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:47,398
I wanted to kill him.

255
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,787
Damn. Damn it!

256
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:53,037
He was a truly terrible person!

257
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:54,507
Considerate? Yeah, right!

258
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,578
He was always sticking his nose where it didn't belong!

259
00:18:57,088 --> 00:19:01,078
Despite the injustice you experienced, what you did was still a crime.

260
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:04,078
It's unforgivable.

261
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:09,858
There's someone here who chose not to commit a crime,

262
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:11,838
even though he faced injustice like you.

263
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:12,838
Huh?

264
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:13,968
What?

265
00:19:15,608 --> 00:19:17,488
Yes, you.

266
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:20,478
You had your eye on Kusano-san.

267
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,248
You in the hoodie.

268
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:33,678
The man from the restaurant?

269
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:39,118
You clearly bore some grudge against Kusano-san.

270
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:48,758
Yes.

271
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:52,708
Because of his meddling, I was fired from my job.

272
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:59,218
Lately I'd been keeping an eye on him and had been rehearsing my own murder.

273
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:00,968
You what?

274
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:02,907
Not only that, but today

275
00:20:02,908 --> 00:20:08,978
I'd planned to kill him using exactly the same method you deduced, Mori-san.

276
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:10,228
What?

277
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:11,768
Unbelievable.

278
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,977
So when the murder occurred,

279
00:20:58,978 --> 00:21:02,448
I thought I might've done it. I was scared.

280
00:21:02,768 --> 00:21:04,867
But you didn't do it.

281
00:21:04,868 --> 00:21:08,708
You made yourself stay in the restaurant. You controlled yourself.

282
00:21:08,878 --> 00:21:12,657
But if he hadn't acted,

283
00:21:12,658 --> 00:21:16,338
I think I probably would've attacked Kusano-san.

284
00:21:16,518 --> 00:21:19,797
You've been watching Kusano-san for a while.

285
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:24,358
You've probably had plenty of chances to kill him until now.

286
00:21:25,778 --> 00:21:27,048
I...

287
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:36,068
I believe you deliberately chose not to commit a crime.

288
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:40,718
M-Mori-san...

289
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:21,348
Hup.

290
00:23:24,668 --> 00:23:26,887
Ma'am, allow me to hold that.

291
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:28,207
What are you doing?

292
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:30,147
You're not trying to rob me, are you?

293
00:23:30,148 --> 00:23:32,918
What? Of course not.

294
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:38,058
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.

295
00:23:38,488 --> 00:23:42,818
Jeez, it's so hard to be considerate.

296
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:45,108
You've got that right.

297
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,738
We were too late.

298
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:52,088
He's dead.

299
00:23:52,538 --> 00:23:55,328
This is what that letter was warning us about.

300
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,887
It's the piano's curse!

301
00:23:57,888 --> 00:23:59,298
This isn't a curse.

302
00:24:00,118 --> 00:24:02,168
It's a murder case.

303
00:24:02,348 --> 00:24:06,308
Does this sheet music that was found with the body mean anything?

304
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:10,178
And what about the letter warning us about this case?

305
00:24:11,168 --> 00:24:11,888
Wait a minute.

306
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:17,298
The next episode of Conan is "The Moonlight Sonata Murder, Part One!"
