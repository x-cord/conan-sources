1
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:26,359
What? You saw Shuichi Akai?

2
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,159
Remember that robbery

3
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:32,359
at Tohto Bank at Beikacho the other day?

4
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,659
They reported on the news that the trial

5
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,059
for that incident started yesterday,

6
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,859
it seems that he was seen turning around towards the camera.

7
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:41,959
A man who resembled him

8
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,359
seemed to be among the people who were released.

9
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:50,959
Well, it's most probably some guy that just looks like him, though.

10
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:54,859
Because after all, you and me,

11
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:57,959
we confirmed with our own eyes.

12
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:01,759
That Akai who came walking right into our trap at Raiha pass,

13
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,959
was shot in the head by Kir's gun.

14
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,859
-Go get Kir. -What?

15
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:41,059
Sherry who got away appeared at Haido City Hotel.

16
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:47,859
Akai who tried to attack us, lured us to go

17
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:50,859
to the Mouri Detective Agency in Beikacho.

18
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,759
The hospital that the FBI confined Kir in

19
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,359
was the Haido Central Hospital.

20
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,359
"Haido Central Hospital"

21
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,559
And, the man who resembled Akai

22
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:07,659
appeared at the bank in Beikacho.

23
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:11,359
Beikacho and Haidocho are so near.

24
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:13,559
Do you think this is a coincidence?

25
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:22,059
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

26
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,159
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

27
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,859
There is a bomb scare at a department store.

28
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:28,459
What are the men in black after?

29
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,159
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,059
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:33,959
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

32
00:04:15,265 --> 00:04:18,065
The man that we ran into on our way home from school

33
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:19,665
was called Mr. Kyozo Daita.

34
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:24,765
After realizing that he was planning on committing suicide,

35
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,665
we tried to somehow stop him from doing so and succeeded.

36
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:29,065
But, at that time I found out

37
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:32,765
from Genta and the others about an unexpected fact.

38
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:35,465
When we encountered the bank robbery,

39
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:37,765
they say that the man, who was also present

40
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:42,165
at the previous bus jack we got messed up in, was there.

41
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:44,565
That person can't possibly be...

42
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:48,765
In the meantime, a strange job offer

43
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:51,265
came to the Mouri Detective Agency.

44
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:52,665
The client asked us to solve a mystery

45
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:55,765
about red T-shirts that were being sent every week,

46
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:58,365
and asked us to talk to him.

47
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:02,165
The following day, in order to meet the client,

48
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:05,565
we went to the Beika Department Store.

49
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:10,065
FBI agent, Jodie was also there.

50
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:12,665
The person she is searching for is most probably,

51
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:13,865
that man.

52
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:23,465
"The 13 Black Suggestions"

53
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:25,665
"Beika Department Store"

54
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,865
Really, I tell you.

55
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:37,865
It's after 1 pm already.

56
00:05:37,865 --> 00:05:41,465
The client hasn't shown up yet.

57
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:42,965
Forget it.

58
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:44,465
I'm quitting!

59
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:49,665
We're going home.

60
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:55,065
I wonder what this paper bag is?

61
00:05:55,065 --> 00:05:57,165
Maybe somebody forgot it?

62
00:05:57,165 --> 00:06:01,165
I don't think you should touch that.

63
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:07,765
Because I think there's a bomb inside it.

64
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:09,265
Bomb?

65
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:10,765
You said bomb?

66
00:06:10,765 --> 00:06:13,265
How do you know?

67
00:06:13,265 --> 00:06:16,565
Well...

68
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:20,465
Because I am also...

69
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,965
Look at me.

70
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,865
That's why.

71
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:27,665
A bomb?

72
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:36,065
I'm sorry, James.

73
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:38,565
I haven't finished lunch yet.

74
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:42,965
Hey, just how long do you intend to spend on lunch, Jodie?

75
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:44,965
Well, a lot of things have been happening

76
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:47,565
and I'm still at the cafe on the basement floor.

77
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:51,665
A lot of things? Any problem?

78
00:06:51,665 --> 00:06:54,065
No, it's nothing like that.

79
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:57,465
Okay, after Camel comes out of the men's room,

80
00:06:57,465 --> 00:06:59,665
and I finish drinking my ice tea,

81
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:01,865
we'll head on to join you there.

82
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,465
I wonder, what's gotten into her?

83
00:07:05,465 --> 00:07:09,365
Jodie recently seems to have changed.

84
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:12,265
Ever since the robbery, I think.

85
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,665
She told me not to tell James

86
00:07:14,665 --> 00:07:17,865
but I wonder what her concern about the black cap is?

87
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,165
Hold... Hold it...

88
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,165
Hold it there!

89
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:45,465
That was... It can't be...

90
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,865
It can't be!

91
00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:52,865
Strange...

92
00:07:52,865 --> 00:07:56,065
If a man with a burn who can't talk comes to shop,

93
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:59,265
I'm sure that one of the sales clerks should remember him.

94
00:07:59,265 --> 00:08:02,765
Does that mean that there was no such person in the first place?

95
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,065
Then who was that guy that I saw?

96
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:11,965
Shu?

97
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:13,265
Sorry.

98
00:08:16,865 --> 00:08:18,765
Shu.

99
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,465
Shu, is it you? It's you, isn't it, Shu?

100
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:23,265
Tell me that it's you, Shu!

101
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:27,665
What's it about?

102
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:32,565
The edge of the coaster is bent.

103
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:34,265
Was it bent to begin with?

104
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:41,665
Get out of here! This area is dangerous.

105
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:45,465
Shu!

106
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:51,065
Shu!

107
00:09:01,565 --> 00:09:04,365
Why do you have something like that on your body?

108
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:06,265
I have no idea!

109
00:09:06,265 --> 00:09:08,565
I was attacked from behind in the men's room and passed out.

110
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:12,565
When I came, a masked man had wrapped this around me.

111
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:15,265
That man told me

112
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:18,165
to put paper bags in front of the escalator

113
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:20,865
as well as in front of the stairs too, so I did.

114
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:25,965
He threatened to set the bomb off if I didn't listen to him.

115
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,465
At any rate, get the police!

116
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:30,365
-Call the police, won't you... -No, you can't!

117
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:32,065
Because he told me that the moment the police

118
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:33,365
approached this department store,

119
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,865
he would push the bomb switch to set it off!

120
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:38,065
And of course,

121
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:40,565
he told me that even if one person flees from this floor,

122
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:42,065
that's it.

123
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:44,765
No way... Can't be!

124
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:47,765
What did the man want?

125
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:50,265
He wanted to find

126
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:55,365
the sender who puts of the 13 red T-shirts in this bag.

127
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:58,165
He needs to be found at any cost.

128
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,765
-Red T-shirts? -What?

129
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:04,965
Yes. He said that...

130
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:08,065
the sender is definitely on this floor!

131
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:11,165
He's definitely on this floor?

132
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:18,665
"Beika Department Store"

133
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:21,065
Hey... Are you serious?

134
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:24,865
He said that if he can't find the sender of the T-shirts,

135
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:27,665
he's going to blow up the bomb?

136
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:34,565
Yes. The masked man who wrapped the bomb around my body said so.

137
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:39,365
Moreover, he tells you that the sender is on this floor too?

138
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:41,165
Yes.

139
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:46,265
He said that if the person turns up,

140
00:10:46,265 --> 00:10:49,865
he won't push the switch of the bomb.

141
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:52,065
Hey! You heard what he just said, didn't you?

142
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:53,665
I don't know what your problem is,

143
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:56,765
but come out you, sender of the load of red T-shirts!

144
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:59,165
If you're here, please come on out!

145
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,765
I guess nobody's coming out.

146
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:09,965
Yes.

147
00:11:09,965 --> 00:11:12,765
He was saying to turn off the escalators

148
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:16,965
and to make sure that the elevator doesn't stop on this floor too.

149
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:18,565
I see.

150
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:20,365
He plans to keep all the people confined here

151
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:25,065
until he finds the sender of the T-shirts.

152
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:26,965
It can't be.

153
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:28,965
No way, no darn way!

154
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:30,365
Hey, hold it!

155
00:11:30,365 --> 00:11:32,665
Hold your horses! Hey!

156
00:11:34,665 --> 00:11:35,865
Calm down, hey!

157
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:36,965
Everyone, calm down!

158
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:38,465
Hey!

159
00:11:57,772 --> 00:12:00,372
Excuse me. Please stay on this floor.

160
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,672
Calm down!

161
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:22,972
You heard what he said, didn't you?

162
00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:24,172
The culprit is saying

163
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:27,772
that he wants to find the one who send him the red T-shirts

164
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:31,672
and that he's sure that the sender is here on this floor.

165
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:35,372
He also saying that if anyone flees from this floor,

166
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:37,372
he's going to switch the bomb on!

167
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:40,572
Of course calling the police is the out of the question!

168
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:44,372
Even if one person acts on his own, there's going to be victims.

169
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:46,172
I mean, that's what he said, right?

170
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:48,372
Yes.

171
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,772
Excuse me,

172
00:12:54,772 --> 00:12:57,972
but could you call the person in charge

173
00:12:57,972 --> 00:12:59,972
and have the escalators stopped

174
00:12:59,972 --> 00:13:03,472
as well as not make the elevators stop on this floor.

175
00:13:03,472 --> 00:13:07,372
-Yes, sir. -Of course not to use stairs too.

176
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:12,372
Please make sure too that no one contacts the police!

177
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:14,772
Because it is very likely that the culprit is here

178
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:19,572
and watching everything that we're doing.

179
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:21,372
All right.

180
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:27,272
So, what are we going to do now?

181
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:30,472
Why don't we take a look?

182
00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:32,072
At the mysterious red T-shirts

183
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:35,772
that are being sent to him every week!

184
00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:37,772
What? Did I mention it?

185
00:13:37,772 --> 00:13:40,472
That they were being sent every week?

186
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:45,872
A client who seems to know the bomb man asked us to do some checking.

187
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:50,072
We were told by the person who red T-shirts sent to him every week,

188
00:13:50,072 --> 00:13:52,472
would come after noon to the sports goods floor

189
00:13:52,472 --> 00:13:55,472
of the Beika Department Store

190
00:13:55,472 --> 00:13:57,172
and would like me,

191
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:59,672
Kogoro Mouri's help on the matter!

192
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,072
Kogoro Mouri...

193
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:04,172
You mean that famous detective?

194
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:06,072
Yes. That's why,

195
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:13,172
I will find the sender of the red T-shirts and bomb man right away!

196
00:14:13,172 --> 00:14:16,772
Well, keep your distance and watch.

197
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,272
Yes...

198
00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:23,572
What?

199
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,172
A man with a burn scar on his right cheek

200
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:28,372
left this store a while ago?

201
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:30,472
Is that true?

202
00:14:30,472 --> 00:14:34,172
Yes. Right after you left to go outside

203
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:37,472
to answer the call that you received.

204
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:41,772
That man, wasn't he wearing a cap like this?

205
00:14:41,772 --> 00:14:44,472
Yes, he was.

206
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:49,072
Is he Mr. Akai?

207
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:52,472
I passed him in the men's room a while ago.

208
00:14:52,472 --> 00:14:56,172
With a man who looks exactly like Mr. Akai with a burn scar.

209
00:14:56,172 --> 00:14:59,372
No way! Is he here?

210
00:14:59,372 --> 00:15:03,272
Yes. I lost track of him, though.

211
00:15:03,272 --> 00:15:05,172
But, what brings him here?

212
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:09,072
What? Then don't tell me that the person you said

213
00:15:09,072 --> 00:15:13,072
you saw during the bank robbery was...

214
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:14,472
Yes, exactly!

215
00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:17,672
I was looking for him because he disappeared in the hustle and bustle

216
00:15:17,672 --> 00:15:18,972
after the case.

217
00:15:18,972 --> 00:15:23,372
Then I realized that the mark on the back of the cap

218
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:27,372
was an original design by the Beika Department Store.

219
00:15:27,372 --> 00:15:30,872
So, I came down looking for a clue or something!

220
00:15:32,572 --> 00:15:34,072
I'm sorry.

221
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:36,172
I wasn't too sure myself,

222
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:38,372
so I couldn't tell any of the agents yet.

223
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:42,072
Besides, it seems as though he lost his memory and can't talk,

224
00:15:42,072 --> 00:15:44,272
so I couldn't confirm anything either.

225
00:15:44,272 --> 00:15:46,072
You see...

226
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:49,872
Is it possible that this is a trap that they set?

227
00:15:49,872 --> 00:15:51,172
What?

228
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:53,572
You said so yourself too!

229
00:15:53,572 --> 00:15:55,772
That Shuichi Akai died!

230
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:58,472
You also confirmed the fingerprints of the corpse, didn't you?

231
00:15:58,472 --> 00:16:00,172
There's no way that he's alive!

232
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:01,972
But...

233
00:16:01,972 --> 00:16:06,972
The fingerprints of Conan and you were found,

234
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:09,372
along with fingerprints of the man

235
00:16:09,372 --> 00:16:11,472
who burned to death a while ago.

236
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:15,372
If it's Shu, I'm sure he'll do something about the situation!

237
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:18,872
Besides, just what kind of trap do you propose this to be?

238
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:22,972
Well... maybe they're up to something

239
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:25,972
and trying to throw us off by confusing us.

240
00:16:25,972 --> 00:16:27,672
The riot police?

241
00:16:30,872 --> 00:16:32,272
Why?

242
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:36,172
Come to think of it, something happened on the floor above.

243
00:16:36,172 --> 00:16:41,172
People were shouting that the elevator wouldn't stop on it.

244
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:44,572
If so, I'm sure that the man with the burn is Shu!

245
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:45,672
What?

246
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:51,272
Look! This is a message that the man with the burn secretly gave me.

247
00:16:51,272 --> 00:16:52,972
What?

248
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:55,972
Then, Mr. Akai somehow found out beforehand

249
00:16:55,972 --> 00:16:58,972
that something was going to happen at this department store and...

250
00:16:58,972 --> 00:16:59,972
Yes.

251
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:03,872
There's no doubt that he already got his memory back.

252
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:05,872
But, what's going on?

253
00:17:05,872 --> 00:17:09,572
What on earth is going on, Shu?

254
00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:18,872
According to the torn piece of paper of the courier

255
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,772
that had been peeled off, where the T-shirts were inside,

256
00:17:22,772 --> 00:17:25,972
the T-shirts that were sent 7 weeks, 6 weeks and 5 weeks ago

257
00:17:25,972 --> 00:17:29,872
were all two each,

258
00:17:29,872 --> 00:17:32,972
but for some reason the one sent 4 weeks ago,

259
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:34,972
was just one.

260
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:38,672
Then, 3 weeks, 2 weeks ago and last week,

261
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:44,472
two red T-shirts were sent again.

262
00:17:44,472 --> 00:17:46,972
I wonder if there's any meaning to it?

263
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:48,072
I wonder...

264
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:53,172
They total 13 T-shirts in all, unlucky number...

265
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,672
Hey, don't come near me!

266
00:17:55,672 --> 00:17:57,372
I mean you're carrying a bomb!

267
00:17:57,372 --> 00:17:59,472
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:03,672
There something red on the shoulder

269
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:06,672
part of the coat you're wearing, sir.

270
00:18:06,672 --> 00:18:08,972
Hey... if it's red,

271
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:11,072
is it has something to do with what's happening too?

272
00:18:11,072 --> 00:18:15,172
Oh, I think it's somebody's lipstick.

273
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:19,272
Because the train I took here was quite crowded.

274
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:20,772
Is that so...

275
00:18:20,772 --> 00:18:24,672
Anyway, you go and stay some distance away for a while.

276
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:26,372
Yes, sir.

277
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:30,072
There something more inside the package

278
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:33,772
-that the T-shirts were in. -What?

279
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:37,872
Isn't this the receipt of the T-shirts when they were bought?

280
00:18:37,872 --> 00:18:40,972
The number of T-shirts that were bought match too.

281
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:42,572
A receipt?

282
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:44,172
Yes.

283
00:18:44,172 --> 00:18:46,572
There's a receipt of the T-shirt for the package

284
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:49,572
with one T-shirt inside!

285
00:18:49,572 --> 00:18:52,372
They seem to be inside the other packages too!

286
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:54,472
-What? -Look.

287
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:05,372
Certainly, the date shown on the receipt

288
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:08,572
and the date on the courier invoice match,

289
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:11,372
so we can tell that it was sent the same day it was bought.

290
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:13,172
Since the receipt is ripped,

291
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:15,672
it's impossible to tell where the item was bought.

292
00:19:15,672 --> 00:19:18,572
But something is in view only on the receipt

293
00:19:18,572 --> 00:19:20,872
for the T-shirts bought last week.

294
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:22,772
See, it wasn't ripped off clean enough,

295
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:25,572
so a mark of something is in view.

296
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:28,872
This is...

297
00:19:28,872 --> 00:19:31,672
It's the mark of the Beika Department Store here!

298
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:35,272
Besides, doesn't it bother you that all the items were

299
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:39,072
bought at the same time, 12:28 pm?

300
00:19:42,372 --> 00:19:45,272
I see! That's why the bomb man

301
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:48,972
is so sure that the sender is on this floor!

302
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:50,072
Because he found out that the sender

303
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:53,972
was buying the T-shirts here afternoon!

304
00:19:53,972 --> 00:19:55,372
Wait a sec.

305
00:19:55,372 --> 00:19:58,772
But why is this sports item floor?

306
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:02,372
Maybe because this T-shirt is an underwear?

307
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:05,572
"Underwear" -It's written on the receipt too.

308
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:08,872
You know, it's a polyester wear that is worn

309
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:12,872
when jogging that sucks up perspiration and dries quickly!

310
00:20:12,872 --> 00:20:14,572
I get it!

311
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:17,672
Do you know where this is sold?

312
00:20:17,672 --> 00:20:21,072
I think it's sold in the fitness wear section.

313
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:23,772
Please take us there!

314
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:26,072
Yes, sir. This way.

315
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:33,472
Strange.

316
00:20:33,472 --> 00:20:35,772
The receipts till two weeks ago are torn,

317
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:38,372
so you can't tell where the items were bought.

318
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:41,072
Why did the sender make such a mistake just this week.

319
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:42,572
Besides...

320
00:20:45,872 --> 00:20:47,772
What's the matter, Conan?

321
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:49,672
Did you notice something again?

322
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:51,172
Oh, yes...

323
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:53,772
I was thinking that this receipt is strange.

324
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:54,872
Strange?

325
00:20:54,872 --> 00:20:56,272
Because... Look.

326
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:58,272
If the sender wanted to hide the place,

327
00:20:58,272 --> 00:21:00,772
he could've just torn off the upper left part,

328
00:21:00,772 --> 00:21:03,372
but the upper right part is torn off too.

329
00:21:03,372 --> 00:21:06,172
Maybe this person is just not too reliable?

330
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:08,572
Even the T-shirts are folded messily.

331
00:21:08,572 --> 00:21:11,672
-What? The way they're folded? -Yes.

332
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:19,872
See! There's a strange crease on this one T-shirt.

333
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:23,172
If you fold this T-shirt, according to the crease...

334
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:25,472
This is how it looks.

335
00:21:27,172 --> 00:21:29,772
This is...

336
00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:31,472
Couldn't it be...

337
00:21:36,072 --> 00:21:38,772
What shall we do? Shall we force entry?

338
00:21:38,772 --> 00:21:40,472
No, wait.

339
00:21:40,472 --> 00:21:43,472
It seems that the bomb man said that if the police approach,

340
00:21:43,472 --> 00:21:46,272
he would set the bomb off.

341
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,672
But...

342
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:49,972
According to the informant, the bombs are...

343
00:21:49,972 --> 00:21:51,972
We can't rely on that information.

344
00:21:51,972 --> 00:21:55,972
They may have said that just because they want to be safe.

345
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:58,372
We've got no choice now but to wait

346
00:21:58,372 --> 00:22:00,872
for the bomb man to make his move.

347
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:04,972
Hey.

348
00:22:04,972 --> 00:22:08,072
How long do I have to wait?

349
00:22:08,072 --> 00:22:10,972
For a phantom that's not even around.

350
00:22:10,972 --> 00:22:13,272
Hold horses, Chianti.

351
00:22:13,272 --> 00:22:15,272
The info we got of a man who resembles Akai,

352
00:22:15,272 --> 00:22:18,672
is going into the department store is certain.

353
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,572
I'm going to check with my own eyes

354
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:24,272
whether that guy is really a phantom or not.

355
00:22:24,272 --> 00:22:27,372
If it turns out that he isn't a phantom,

356
00:22:27,372 --> 00:22:29,572
in that exact moment,

357
00:22:29,572 --> 00:22:33,372
you're going to become a phantom.

358
00:22:33,372 --> 00:22:34,872
Kir.

359
00:23:56,472 --> 00:24:00,172
Transform!

360
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:03,572
I'm so overjoyed I can't contain it.

361
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:06,672
Because then, I could kill him all over again.

362
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:12,372
Wait, Dad. That's right near the bomb.

363
00:24:12,372 --> 00:24:14,972
I won't allow the bombs to explode.

364
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:20,372
In the name of the great detective, Kogoro Mouri.

365
00:24:20,372 --> 00:24:21,872
Next Conan,

366
00:24:21,872 --> 00:24:28,772
"Black Time Limit Closes In"
