1
00:00:00,742 --> 00:00:03,642
The old man was hired by three suspicious people

2
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:06,042
to protect the racing horse, White Spirits,

3
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:09,942
who had received several death threats.

4
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:12,242
"White Spirits, Racing Horse" -Several days later,

5
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:16,242
"Kozo Tokuyoshi (55), Horse Owner" -White Spirits was to be transported

6
00:00:16,242 --> 00:00:19,142
to a track outside of Tokyo for a race.

7
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:21,642
"White Spirits" -The old man escorted the horse trailer, but...

8
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:33,142
At some point, White Spirits was swapped out for an impostor.

9
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:37,242
Horse owner, Tokuyoshi received a ransom note

10
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:39,542
demanding 100 million yen.

11
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:43,342
Unable to trust the police or detectives,

12
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:45,642
Tokuyoshi followed the kidnapper's instructions alone

13
00:00:45,642 --> 00:00:48,542
and had the ransom money stolen from him.

14
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:52,642
In my eyes are maximum creation.

15
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:54,442
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

16
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:56,142
The ransom money and horse go missing.

17
00:00:56,142 --> 00:00:58,242
The two cases are connected in a surprising way.

18
00:00:58,242 --> 00:00:59,942
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:01,742
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:04,042
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:50,835
"The Thoroughbred Kidnapping Case (Part 2)"

22
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:05,862
"White Spirits"

23
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:11,862
I'm certain of it, inspector.

24
00:03:11,862 --> 00:03:15,462
This is the horse blanket White Spirits was wearing.

25
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:19,462
Oh, no.

26
00:03:19,462 --> 00:03:21,762
Is he already...

27
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:23,962
Inspector, according to a local

28
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:26,862
who took their garbage out an hour ago,

29
00:03:26,862 --> 00:03:29,962
that wasn't here at that time.

30
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:34,662
How did the police know this was here?

31
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:37,462
We received an anonymous tip.

32
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:39,062
An anonymous tip?

33
00:03:39,062 --> 00:03:41,062
They thought it was dumped illegally.

34
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:43,062
And there seems to be blood on it,

35
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:44,862
so they wanted us to investigate.

36
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:52,862
I received a report from forensics.

37
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:57,862
The blood on the horse blanket matched White Spirits'.

38
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,062
Are you sure?

39
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:02,562
We got the data from the stable's vet.

40
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:04,162
It's definitely his.

41
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:09,162
Which means it's possible he's already...

42
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:12,762
The media's starting to make a fuss, too.

43
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:15,062
That can't be helped.

44
00:04:15,062 --> 00:04:17,862
He's an extraordinary and popular racing horse.

45
00:04:17,862 --> 00:04:20,062
We should prepare for a press conference immediately.

46
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:25,762
Actually, they're also making a fuss over something else.

47
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:27,262
What do you mean?

48
00:04:27,262 --> 00:04:29,762
"Famous Horse Missing, Kidnapped!"

49
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:30,762
"100 million yen ransom!"

50
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:32,562
"Death threats previously received!"

51
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:34,462
"Bloody horse blanket discovered! Is the horse already dead?"

52
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:35,962
"Massive failure!"

53
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:38,262
"Kidnapping happened under the watch of a great detective and the police!"

54
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:41,962
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Darn it! Who do they think they are?

55
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:46,662
I hate to say it, but if Tokuyoshi had cooperated,

56
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:49,562
this wouldn't have happened.

57
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:52,862
You've had too much to drink, dad.

58
00:04:52,862 --> 00:04:54,862
How can I not drink?

59
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:57,762
It's not like I wanted to fail.

60
00:04:57,762 --> 00:04:58,962
More importantly,

61
00:04:58,962 --> 00:05:03,162
we're still not sure White Spirits was killed, right?

62
00:05:03,162 --> 00:05:08,362
Well, yeah, but the blood was a match.

63
00:05:08,362 --> 00:05:09,862
I'm sure he's fine.

64
00:05:09,862 --> 00:05:13,362
The kidnapper got the ransom money he wanted.

65
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:15,362
I'm sure he'll return him.

66
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:23,662
"Saniaki Nagaura, Masao Shiomi" -I know who did it. I'm absolutely certain.

67
00:05:23,662 --> 00:05:27,862
"Yasutaka Hase, Chizuru Kakuta" -So why did they hire the old man?

68
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:31,562
I'll have to review the case again.

69
00:05:43,062 --> 00:05:44,162
What's this?

70
00:05:47,662 --> 00:05:49,062
Could it be...

71
00:05:57,562 --> 00:06:00,762
I see. So that's how it is.

72
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:03,362
How did I not notice this?

73
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:12,462
Hello, Officer Takagi?

74
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:16,662
Kogoro asked me to do something for him.

75
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:20,062
Over here.

76
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:25,162
Hey, Conan.

77
00:06:25,162 --> 00:06:26,662
Please play the tape.

78
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:27,662
Got it.

79
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:35,562
This is it. Stop the video.

80
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:39,262
This is the trailer the real White Spirits was in.

81
00:06:39,262 --> 00:06:41,662
Which means we might know where it went

82
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:45,062
if we follow it on the other security camera.

83
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:47,562
I'm impressed Mouri noticed.

84
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:50,662
Is he really in there?

85
00:06:50,662 --> 00:06:54,462
Are we sure the real White Spirits was in this trailer?

86
00:06:54,462 --> 00:07:00,162
Well, we can't see inside the trailer from here, but...

87
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:03,062
Could you show us that part again?

88
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:04,062
Sure.

89
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:10,062
Stop the video!

90
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,462
Look at this, Officer Takagi.

91
00:07:13,462 --> 00:07:15,862
What? The date?

92
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:18,362
Wait, what? Could it be?

93
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:21,062
Which means...

94
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:24,662
But why?

95
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:27,262
There's only one conceivable reason.

96
00:07:27,262 --> 00:07:28,762
Now I just need evidence.

97
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:36,262
"Satoshi Ihara (25)" -I'm sorry, I'm still only a trainee.

98
00:07:36,262 --> 00:07:40,362
I'm unsure of the details, but...

99
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:43,462
But there's something bothering you, isn't there?

100
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:46,662
One of the horse trailers hasn't come back.

101
00:07:47,862 --> 00:07:49,562
Since when?

102
00:07:49,562 --> 00:07:51,662
I think it's been three days now.

103
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:52,762
Three days...

104
00:07:54,062 --> 00:07:57,462
Come to think of it, it must be since three days ago.

105
00:07:57,462 --> 00:07:59,662
"White Spirits" -I couldn't find White Spirits' spare riding

106
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:03,162
or grooming gear.

107
00:08:03,162 --> 00:08:06,362
So it disappeared along with the horse trailer.

108
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:09,562
Where was White Spirits then? Here?

109
00:08:09,562 --> 00:08:12,562
I'm not sure.

110
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:15,162
I was working with another horse that day,

111
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,762
so I was out at the track.

112
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:22,762
But when I returned that night, White Spirits was here.

113
00:08:22,762 --> 00:08:25,962
Which means it probably happened then.

114
00:08:28,262 --> 00:08:31,362
Hey, is this a bloodstain?

115
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:32,662
A bloodstain?

116
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:35,762
Oh, actually...

117
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:37,362
What happened?

118
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:40,762
It's not a secret or anything.

119
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:43,362
That happened three days ago, too...

120
00:08:43,362 --> 00:08:46,562
No, the day before that.

121
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:51,262
White Spirits rubbed against a splinter that formed there.

122
00:08:51,262 --> 00:08:56,062
But the vet said it fortunately wasn't serious,

123
00:08:56,062 --> 00:08:59,062
and wouldn't affect his ability to race.

124
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:02,262
I see. So that's how it is.

125
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:05,862
What's that?

126
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:08,962
The truth is starting to come together.

127
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:12,762
Hello, Takagi?

128
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:17,262
I need you to convey a message to the inspector immediately.

129
00:09:17,262 --> 00:09:19,062
Hello, this is Takagi.

130
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:20,062
Mouri?

131
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:27,113
What's the meaning of this?

132
00:09:27,113 --> 00:09:30,113
I thought I said I was through with detectives and the police!

133
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:33,213
Well, actually...

134
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:34,613
Takagi,

135
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:36,013
it better be true

136
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:38,913
that you discovered the culprits and the truth behind the case.

137
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:41,013
What? Mouri, you told me to tell the inspector

138
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,913
that you uncovered the culprit's identity

139
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:46,013
and the truth behind the case.

140
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:49,113
What are you two arguing about?

141
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:50,213
Either way, it doesn't matter.

142
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:52,513
Hurry up and explain the situation.

143
00:09:52,513 --> 00:09:54,213
Dad...

144
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:56,813
You can do it, old man.

145
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:59,513
Mouri.

146
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:01,013
Fine.

147
00:10:01,013 --> 00:10:04,013
Allow me to explain the culprit's identity

148
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:06,813
and the truth behind the case.

149
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:08,113
What?

150
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:10,613
All right.

151
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:12,013
This case

152
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:17,613
about the kidnapping of White Spirits and the stolen ransom money

153
00:10:17,613 --> 00:10:21,813
used fundamentally the same trick.

154
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:23,213
In other words, solve one,

155
00:10:23,213 --> 00:10:25,813
and you've solved the other.

156
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:29,313
Is that true?

157
00:10:29,313 --> 00:10:32,913
Then quit putting on airs and speak.

158
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:35,813
First, how was White Spirits

159
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:38,113
swapped out for another horse?

160
00:10:38,113 --> 00:10:43,813
The driver swapped him for the horse

161
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:46,113
in the other identical trailer parked on the side road.

162
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,313
Since his wife and child were kidnapped,

163
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:51,513
he was forced to follow the culprit's instructions.

164
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:53,613
Isn't that right?

165
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:55,313
Yes.

166
00:10:55,313 --> 00:10:58,113
Takagi, what did you see there?

167
00:10:58,113 --> 00:11:00,713
I believe it was...

168
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:04,413
Tire tracks from two trailers.

169
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,713
It's strange, though.

170
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:08,913
What was strange, Conan?

171
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:14,513
One set of tire tracks was much shallower than the other,

172
00:11:14,513 --> 00:11:18,113
as though nothing were inside it.

173
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:20,013
What?

174
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,013
There was a convenience store at the road

175
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:23,913
leading to the crime scene.

176
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:25,213
At Mouri's direction,

177
00:11:25,213 --> 00:11:28,413
I investigated the security camera footage.

178
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:30,913
Did I tell you to do that?

179
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:33,113
What?

180
00:11:33,113 --> 00:11:35,013
Continue, Takagi.

181
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:36,413
Yes, sir.

182
00:11:36,413 --> 00:11:39,113
I found footage of a horse trailer exiting that side road

183
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:42,813
and passing in front of the convenience store.

184
00:11:42,813 --> 00:11:45,013
Then that must have been it.

185
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:48,013
What about White Spirits? Was he inside?

186
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:51,313
Unfortunately, I was unable to confirm that.

187
00:11:51,313 --> 00:11:55,213
But more importantly, the footage was from three days ago.

188
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:56,613
What?

189
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:59,913
Which means it's possible the trailer and tire marks

190
00:11:59,913 --> 00:12:04,513
were a camouflage created three days earlier.

191
00:12:04,513 --> 00:12:05,813
In other words,

192
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:09,513
the other trailer wasn't on the side road that day,

193
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:11,913
but made to look like it was.

194
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:14,613
The culprit did this to make us believe

195
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:16,913
the horses were swapped, and...

196
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:20,613
No, but White Spirits was actually

197
00:12:20,613 --> 00:12:23,613
swapped out for the impostor, so...

198
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:26,413
Wait. Which means they were swapped not there,

199
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,413
but someplace else.

200
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:32,713
Could it be that they were swapped all along?

201
00:12:32,713 --> 00:12:35,613
-What? -What?

202
00:12:35,613 --> 00:12:37,513
-No way. -Yes.

203
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:39,913
That's what makes this case similar to

204
00:12:39,913 --> 00:12:41,813
"The Adventure of Silver Blaze."

205
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,013
I actually investigated another stable

206
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:47,013
at Mouri's direction, too.

207
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:48,913
What? You, too?

208
00:12:51,113 --> 00:12:52,113
Continue.

209
00:12:52,113 --> 00:12:53,613
Yes, sir.

210
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:58,913
Currently at that stable is this horse.

211
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,913
It's that horse that looks exactly like White Spirits.

212
00:13:04,913 --> 00:13:07,413
This is White Legion.

213
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:09,613
He's the brother of White Spirits.

214
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:10,813
Brother?

215
00:13:10,813 --> 00:13:13,213
I see. I've got it.

216
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:17,313
In other words, the horses weren't swapped there.

217
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:24,013
The disguise placed on White Spirits' brother was removed.

218
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:25,413
That's right.

219
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:30,313
Conan found this there.

220
00:13:30,313 --> 00:13:32,313
Horse hair?

221
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:33,913
Yes. According to forensics,

222
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,413
one is White Spirits' hair used in the disguise.

223
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:40,813
The other belongs to White Legion.

224
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:45,813
They probably both fell out when the disguise was removed.

225
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:49,413
Which means the culprits are the people

226
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:54,213
who dragged me into this by hiring me,

227
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:55,913
setting me up to fail,

228
00:13:55,913 --> 00:13:57,713
and made horse owner Tokuyoshi shun my and the police's protection

229
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,913
and attempt to pay the ransom money alone.

230
00:14:00,913 --> 00:14:03,513
Stable hand Saniaki Nagaura.

231
00:14:03,513 --> 00:14:05,613
Trainer Yasutaka Hase.

232
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:07,813
Jockey Chizuru Kakuta.

233
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:11,413
You three.

234
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:14,113
Is this true, Mouri?

235
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:15,813
How dare you?

236
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:21,313
You think you've used the great Kogoro Mouri,

237
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:23,413
but you haven't at all!

238
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:25,013
He couldn't do it.

239
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:27,313
I thought I'd let the old man handle this one

240
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:29,213
since he loves horses, but...

241
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,513
What? Is this it?

242
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:42,613
It took a little longer this time...

243
00:14:46,313 --> 00:14:47,313
Mouri?

244
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:48,713
Dad?

245
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:53,913
Excuse me.

246
00:14:53,913 --> 00:14:58,313
It's true that the three of you committed this crime.

247
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:01,213
I had Takagi and Chiba confirm

248
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:03,013
that you have no alibis

249
00:15:03,013 --> 00:15:05,213
for when White Spirits was being transported.

250
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:08,013
Nor for three days earlier,

251
00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:10,913
when White Spirits and a horse trailer

252
00:15:10,913 --> 00:15:12,413
temporarily disappeared from the stable.

253
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:15,313
White Spirits was probably already swapped out

254
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:18,913
for White Legion at this time.

255
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:20,413
There's one more person.

256
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:22,413
Trailer driver Shiomi,

257
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:24,213
you're also their accomplice.

258
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:28,613
If there wasn't a second trailer on that side road,

259
00:15:28,613 --> 00:15:31,413
that ruins your whole testimony.

260
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:37,913
Or were your wife and child pretending to be kidnapped, too?

261
00:15:37,913 --> 00:15:41,413
However, there's a ringleader,

262
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:44,013
a mastermind behind this plot.

263
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:47,013
You, Kozo Tokuyoshi.

264
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,513
What?

265
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:50,313
Is that true, dad?

266
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:53,913
Well, well.

267
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:57,813
When did you become the great confused detective?

268
00:15:57,813 --> 00:15:59,813
I'm the victim who was made to pay

269
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:04,513
a 100 million ransom for a mere horse.

270
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:07,313
A mere horse?

271
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:10,413
Hard to imagine a horse owner saying that,

272
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:15,413
especially when you haven't actually paid a single yen.

273
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:18,813
What? What does that mean, Mouri?

274
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:23,013
Remember that none of us checked to see

275
00:16:23,013 --> 00:16:25,413
if there was actually 100 million yen inside that back.

276
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:27,613
You're right.

277
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:31,913
The bag Tokuyoshi took was filled with worthless stuffing.

278
00:16:31,913 --> 00:16:33,813
Just as it was a different horse

279
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:36,713
inside the trailer all along,

280
00:16:36,713 --> 00:16:39,113
he pretended the bag stuffed with magazines

281
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:42,013
contained 100 million yen.

282
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:43,613
What?

283
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:45,713
-Conan. -Here.

284
00:16:47,513 --> 00:16:50,913
You stuffed the magazines in the rack in your living room

285
00:16:50,913 --> 00:16:53,313
inside the bag, didn't you?

286
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:56,013
You left behind part of a ripped cover.

287
00:16:56,013 --> 00:16:59,913
If there are any ripped magazines inside the bag,

288
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:01,513
and it matches that...

289
00:17:01,513 --> 00:17:03,113
Which means...

290
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:04,513
Could it be?

291
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:05,613
Yes.

292
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:08,313
It was all a lie.

293
00:17:08,313 --> 00:17:11,313
But why?

294
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:12,613
Chiba!

295
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:13,613
Yes, sir.

296
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:15,913
Mouri asked me to look into it.

297
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:17,813
Someone requested a payout of the life insurance policy

298
00:17:17,813 --> 00:17:21,513
on White Spirits with a major foreign insurance company.

299
00:17:21,513 --> 00:17:25,513
The beneficiary is Kozo Tokuyoshi.

300
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:28,013
The problem lies in the date the money was requested.

301
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:32,413
It was the day before White Spirits' horse blanket was found.

302
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:35,713
The day before? Wait a minute.

303
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:38,213
Yes.

304
00:17:38,213 --> 00:17:39,913
How did you know

305
00:17:39,913 --> 00:17:44,113
White Spirits was dead at that time, Tokuyoshi?

306
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:49,713
Because they threatened to kill White Spirits.

307
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:53,113
Really? Surely you didn't really think

308
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,613
you'd be paid the insurance money

309
00:17:54,613 --> 00:17:57,013
over such uncertain circumstances.

310
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:03,713
It's actually because your employees reported to you

311
00:18:03,713 --> 00:18:06,713
that they'd killed White Spirits, isn't it?

312
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:10,513
That's right.

313
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:12,413
You...

314
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:14,013
I know nothing of this.

315
00:18:14,013 --> 00:18:17,013
They kidnapped him on their own.

316
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,713
I'm innocent. I'm a victim.

317
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:23,813
And ultimately, White Spirits is dead.

318
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:26,713
They killed him.

319
00:18:26,713 --> 00:18:30,113
It's within my rights to request the insurance money.

320
00:18:30,113 --> 00:18:31,913
Yes, that's right.

321
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:36,413
But only if White Spirits really is dead.

322
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:37,913
What?

323
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:39,613
What do you mean, dad?

324
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:40,613
Could it be?

325
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:48,813
White Spirits!

326
00:18:48,813 --> 00:18:51,513
He's okay. What a relief.

327
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:53,013
Impossible.

328
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:54,913
You knew?

329
00:18:54,913 --> 00:18:56,313
Yes.

330
00:18:56,313 --> 00:18:58,513
While acting according to Tokuyoshi's

331
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:02,713
White Spirits kidnapping and murder plot,

332
00:19:02,713 --> 00:19:04,013
in the end,

333
00:19:04,013 --> 00:19:07,913
you hid White Spirits in a safe place rather than killing him.

334
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:13,313
And to increase the credibility of your report to Tokuyoshi,

335
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:15,013
you left an anonymous tip with the police

336
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:18,913
so they'd discover the horse blanket White Spirits bled on

337
00:19:18,913 --> 00:19:21,613
when he scratched himself at the stables.

338
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:23,013
What?

339
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:29,313
Where has White Spirits been until now?

340
00:19:29,313 --> 00:19:31,713
-Conan! -Here!

341
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,113
Did you bring it?

342
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:34,713
Yeah, you mean this?

343
00:19:36,713 --> 00:19:40,413
This photo wasn't taken at Tokuyoshi Stables.

344
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,513
The color of the wall is different.

345
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:43,913
It's Kitado Stables.

346
00:19:43,913 --> 00:19:47,013
We used to work there.

347
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:51,213
White Spirits and White Legion were born there.

348
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:53,513
So he's been there until now?

349
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:58,113
Yes. The trailer I used to transport White Spirits is there, too.

350
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,613
But why did you do this?

351
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:05,213
Isn't it obvious, inspector?

352
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:09,513
Because for them, he's not a mere horse.

353
00:20:10,713 --> 00:20:13,313
We were bought with money.

354
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:16,113
That man, Kozo Tokuyoshi,

355
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:19,313
poached us and White Spirits.

356
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:24,613
But I loved White Spirits, as a jockey.

357
00:20:24,613 --> 00:20:26,613
As a stable hand.

358
00:20:26,613 --> 00:20:27,913
As a trainer.

359
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:36,413
You must've raised White Spirits

360
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:38,813
since the day he was born.

361
00:20:38,813 --> 00:20:41,113
Tokuyoshi, who was under financial strain

362
00:20:41,113 --> 00:20:43,013
due to some reckless foreign investments,

363
00:20:43,013 --> 00:20:46,313
planned to fake the kidnapping of and ultimately kill White Spirits

364
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:49,813
in order to fraudulently obtain a huge insurance payout.

365
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:51,713
He used the debts his employees owned

366
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:54,813
to force them to carry out the crime.

367
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:56,813
In order to stop him,

368
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:59,013
they disguised themselves and hired the old man

369
00:20:59,013 --> 00:21:02,113
to protect White Spirits.

370
00:21:02,113 --> 00:21:04,013
"Great Detective Kogoro Mouri" -With a great detective on the case,

371
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:07,913
they assumed Tokuyoshi would cancel his plans.

372
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:10,613
However, Tokuyoshi believed having a famous detective nearby

373
00:21:10,613 --> 00:21:13,713
would help him play the victim

374
00:21:13,713 --> 00:21:16,113
and carried out his plan.

375
00:21:16,113 --> 00:21:18,913
They pretended to follow his plan

376
00:21:18,913 --> 00:21:21,513
and hid White Spirits instead,

377
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:25,413
hoping to reveal the truth and that White Spirits was safe

378
00:21:25,413 --> 00:21:28,913
once Tokuyoshi requested the insurance money.

379
00:21:46,913 --> 00:21:48,713
Tokuyoshi was arrested

380
00:21:48,713 --> 00:21:51,413
and his employees were questioned,

381
00:21:51,413 --> 00:21:53,413
but the police later chose not to prosecute them

382
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,313
due to their circumstances.

383
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:25,513
Later, White Spirits returned to racing under a new owner.

384
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,413
White Spirits!

385
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:39,213
You can do it!

386
00:23:43,013 --> 00:23:45,913
"Next Episode" -What? Ms. Sadako!

387
00:23:45,913 --> 00:23:48,513
She was killed last night.

388
00:23:48,513 --> 00:23:49,613
Last night?

389
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:50,813
Is there a problem?

390
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:55,513
Then Detective Kogoro Mouri might know something.

391
00:23:55,513 --> 00:23:58,713
While these three are suspicious,

392
00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:01,513
the culprit isn't one of them.

393
00:24:01,513 --> 00:24:04,113
It's all three of them.

394
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:08,613
Next Conan,

395
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:12,613
