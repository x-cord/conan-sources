1
00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:04,863
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,863
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06,864 --> 00:00:08,863
The fragrance of murder and the blotches

4
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:11,063
of a love affair in a glass of wine.

5
00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:12,663
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:14,563
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:16,664
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:01,737
Yes, who is it?

9
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:03,337
It's Ran Mouri.

10
00:02:03,338 --> 00:02:05,838
Okay. One moment.

11
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:08,937
What's up, Ran?

12
00:02:08,938 --> 00:02:10,237
Yuki,

13
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:13,037
thanks for the books.

14
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:14,137
How did you like it?

15
00:02:14,138 --> 00:02:17,337
Well. My heart was pounding excitedly from beginning to end.

16
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:18,637
So, you thought so, too?

17
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,638
"Yuki Kojima (20)" -You came all this way

18
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,337
just to return it to me?

19
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:23,137
Thank you.

20
00:02:23,138 --> 00:02:24,138
No, well not really.

21
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:28,337
I was on my way to a restaurant with my father and family

22
00:02:28,338 --> 00:02:29,537
so I just dropped by on the way.

23
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:33,537
Hello. Thank you for being nice to my daughter always.

24
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:36,437
No, I've done nothing. Thank you.

25
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:38,237
Hey, Kojima.

26
00:02:38,238 --> 00:02:40,737
"Junji Togashi (22)" -Which plate should I put out?

27
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:42,137
Please wait.

28
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:44,137
Oh, that's right.

29
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:46,737
We're holding a birthday party for a friend now.

30
00:02:46,738 --> 00:02:48,537
Why don't you all join us, Ran?

31
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:49,937
But...

32
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:51,737
Please do so by all means.

33
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,137
There are only going to be three of my university friends,

34
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:56,137
so you don't have to be hesitant.

35
00:02:56,138 --> 00:02:59,137
Besides, being able to meet the renowned Detective Mouri

36
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,738
is a birthday present that can't be beaten.

37
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:05,937
Ran, if it's okay with you, right?

38
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:07,837
Dad!

39
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:11,038
I'll bet all you want to do is get free booze.

40
00:03:12,438 --> 00:03:18,138
"Mystery of the Birthday Wine"

41
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:25,838
Yuki.

42
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:28,537
Where shall I put this?

43
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:30,537
Can you put it in the kitchen for now?

44
00:03:30,538 --> 00:03:31,638
Okay.

45
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:44,737
Oh, my. Are you okay?

46
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:46,838
Yes, I'm fine.

47
00:03:52,338 --> 00:03:56,337
I'm sorry. This chair is a little broken.

48
00:03:56,338 --> 00:03:59,837
The chair that Keiko, the star of today sits on goes way inside, right?

49
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:04,237
Yes. And will you put your bag in the kitchen?

50
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:06,137
It's kind of in the way here.

51
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:08,337
Okay, right away, madam.

52
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:09,937
Are you really okay?

53
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:11,337
You're not hurt, are you?

54
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:13,537
Yes, I'm fine.

55
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:16,437
Yuki, is there anything else you'd like me to do?

56
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:18,137
No, I guess that's it.

57
00:04:18,138 --> 00:04:20,637
I'm sorry to have made you help me.

58
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:22,338
No problem at all.

59
00:04:27,738 --> 00:04:30,237
That chair's broken, Togashi.

60
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:33,238
No problem, because I'll sit in it.

61
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:38,537
-It's Keiko and the others. -Yes.

62
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:39,638
Coming!

63
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:42,237
"Keiko Sawaguchi(20)" -Good evening.

64
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:44,337
We've been waiting for you, Keiko.

65
00:04:44,338 --> 00:04:45,937
Hello.

66
00:04:45,938 --> 00:04:49,137
-Hi, thanks for coming. -Hi there, you're late.

67
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:51,937
Sorry, the roads were jammed.

68
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:54,737
Keiko, I'll go park the car then.

69
00:04:54,738 --> 00:04:56,037
Okay.

70
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:59,737
Keiko, has the day you're going abroad as an exchange student been decided?

71
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:01,837
I'm leaving next week Tuesday.

72
00:05:01,838 --> 00:05:03,937
So, I'm sort of busy with this and that.

73
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:06,138
You mean, you're leaving that soon?

74
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:10,137
Mr. Mouri, please move a bit more to the left.

75
00:05:10,138 --> 00:05:12,537
You mean like so?

76
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:16,537
Yes, okay. Here goes. One plus two is...

77
00:05:16,538 --> 00:05:18,837
Three...

78
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:21,037
I'm so happy to be able to take a snapshot

79
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:22,838
with the renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri.

80
00:05:26,638 --> 00:05:29,537
Huh? The glass cups are already out here.

81
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,237
Yes. Nonaka, will you get the thing out?

82
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:34,538
"Kasuki Nonaka (22)" -Huh? Oh, right.

83
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,137
This is my gift to you!

84
00:05:40,138 --> 00:05:42,137
I bought it when I went to Germany some time ago.

85
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:44,037
Just for your birthday.

86
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:45,738
It wasn't cheap, you know.

87
00:05:46,438 --> 00:05:47,737
Thanks so much!

88
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:50,737
Hey, I dished out my half for it too, you know.

89
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:52,838
Oh, you did?

90
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:00,937
First, for the birthday girl.

91
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:02,338
Thank you.

92
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,637
I hope you like it.

93
00:06:05,638 --> 00:06:06,938
Thank you.

94
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:09,537
Nice color.

95
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:12,437
Hey, Nonaka, leave some for me, too.

96
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,537
Shoots, there's still some more left.

97
00:06:14,538 --> 00:06:17,037
Here you go.

98
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:19,738
Like they say, "Save the best for last".

99
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:22,838
Just enough.

100
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:25,637
Here's a toast to our dear friend,

101
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:28,437
Keiko Sawaguchi's 20th birthday,

102
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:31,537
as well as her study trip abroad to the States.

103
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:32,538
Cheers!

104
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,137
Cheers...

105
00:06:34,138 --> 00:06:35,538
Thank you!

106
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,638
It's delicious.

107
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:44,238
Really. It's so refreshing.

108
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,938
This is really good!

109
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:52,937
Everybody, please don't forget

110
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:55,138
I dished out half the cash.

111
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:05,337
Just what do you think you're doing, Togashi?

112
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:06,637
Sorry, sorry!

113
00:07:06,638 --> 00:07:09,437
I'd completely forgotten about this chair.

114
00:07:09,438 --> 00:07:11,737
Keiko, it didn't spill on your clothes, did it?

115
00:07:11,738 --> 00:07:13,037
I think I'm fine.

116
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:15,537
I spilt the wine of the birthday girl.

117
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:18,337
The bottle's already empty too,

118
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,137
so if you want my drink, you can have it.

119
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:21,538
Go ahead and pass it around.

120
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:26,237
-Nonaka. -Yes.

121
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:29,138
I tell you, you're hopeless, Togashi.

122
00:07:30,138 --> 00:07:32,937
I'm sorry, please bear with that.

123
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:35,137
Okay. Thank you.

124
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:37,637
I almost forgot the cake.

125
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:39,837
Yes, I'll bring it.

126
00:07:39,838 --> 00:07:40,838
Oh, will you please.

127
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,537
"Happy Birthday, Keiko"

128
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:43,937
Ready?

129
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:45,838
I'm going to turn out the lights.

130
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:56,538
Go ahead, Keiko.

131
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:01,937
Happy birthday!

132
00:08:01,938 --> 00:08:03,438
Happy birthday.

133
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:08,038
It's really good.

134
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:13,838
-All set. -Okay, I'll cut the cake, then.

135
00:08:19,738 --> 00:08:21,237
Keiko?

136
00:08:21,238 --> 00:08:23,138
Keiko, what's the matter?

137
00:08:28,438 --> 00:08:30,937
Keiko, what the matter? Get a hold of yourself!

138
00:08:30,938 --> 00:08:32,638
Keiko!

139
00:08:35,138 --> 00:08:36,738
Keiko?

140
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:41,837
Ran, get the ambulance!

141
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:43,637
-Okay. -Get the police, too.

142
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:45,337
Okay.

143
00:08:45,338 --> 00:08:50,438
Stay back! Don't touch anything on the table!

144
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,437
Inspector, poison was found

145
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:03,238
from the cup that the victim drank out of after all.

146
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:06,537
And what about the other glass cups?

147
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:10,237
No poison was detected from the other four glass cups

148
00:09:10,238 --> 00:09:12,738
or the empty wine bottle.

149
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:16,537
And on the cup that was used by the victim, Ms. Sawaguchi,

150
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:19,637
her fingerprints, as well as those of Mr. Togashi,

151
00:09:19,638 --> 00:09:23,037
Mr. Nonaka and Ms. Kojima were also found.

152
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:24,538
The fingerprints of all four people?

153
00:09:29,138 --> 00:09:30,337
I see.

154
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:32,937
The glass cup that Ms. Sawaguchi drank from

155
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:34,437
was the one that Mr. Togashi had passed around

156
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:37,137
to Ms. Kojima and Mr. Nonaka,

157
00:09:37,138 --> 00:09:40,437
and finally passed around to Ms. Sawaguchi, the victim.

158
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:42,337
If you want my drink, you can have it.

159
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:43,638
Go ahead and pass it around.

160
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:48,537
-Nonaka. -Yes.

161
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:51,538
I tell you, you're hopeless, Togashi.

162
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:56,037
-Yes. -And who opened the wine bottle?

163
00:09:56,038 --> 00:09:57,137
It's me.

164
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,837
I pulled the cork off the bottle.

165
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:02,037
Then, I poured wine for Keiko, the birthday girl,

166
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:04,237
the guest, Mr. Mouri,

167
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:06,837
Yuki and myself.

168
00:10:06,838 --> 00:10:09,937
Then I finally took the bottle from Nonaka

169
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:12,138
and poured wine for myself.

170
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:20,037
Inspector, maybe someone had put poison in the glass cup beforehand?

171
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:23,437
But Mr. Togashi, you said that you took a sip of wine from your glass

172
00:10:23,438 --> 00:10:26,237
before you gave it to the victim, didn't you?

173
00:10:26,238 --> 00:10:27,337
Yes.

174
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:30,538
And how do you feel?

175
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:34,538
Just fine.

176
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:41,337
Then, the poison must've been inserted after he drank the wine.

177
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:45,237
Maybe he just pretended to drink and didn't.

178
00:10:45,238 --> 00:10:47,238
He drank out of his cup for sure.

179
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:50,838
I saw him drink after the toast.

180
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:53,837
Shut up, kid.

181
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:57,537
If there were ice cubes in the cup,

182
00:10:57,538 --> 00:11:01,538
then maybe poison could've been put in the ice cubes beforehand.

183
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:06,138
I don't think people ever drink wine on the rocks.

184
00:11:07,638 --> 00:11:08,937
True.

185
00:11:08,938 --> 00:11:12,837
And after he took a sip, Mr. Togashi gave that cup of wine to who?

186
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,137
Me, and I gave it to Mr. Nonaka.

187
00:11:16,138 --> 00:11:18,837
He couldn't have put poison in the cup

188
00:11:18,838 --> 00:11:20,537
since everybody was watching.

189
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:21,837
I see.

190
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:24,238
I was watching him, too.

191
00:11:25,338 --> 00:11:26,737
Inspector,

192
00:11:26,738 --> 00:11:29,237
when Ms. Sawaguchi blew out the candles,

193
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:31,438
the room was dark for an instant.

194
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:33,637
I see.

195
00:11:33,638 --> 00:11:36,138
If then, I guess poison could've been put in.

196
00:11:41,338 --> 00:11:43,837
I see. If then, maybe it would've been possible.

197
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:48,737
Inspector Megure, how about having everyone take their seats again?

198
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:50,937
You want to replay the scene of the crime?

199
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:53,437
Will you help us out, everyone?

200
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:54,638
Yes.

201
00:11:56,038 --> 00:11:57,638
Sure thing.

202
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:01,037
Let's start, then.

203
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:04,737
So, you all sat in this order?

204
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:06,837
Yes, that's right.

205
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:10,837
So, the glass cup that the victim received from Mr. Togashi goes here?

206
00:12:10,838 --> 00:12:12,837
Is this correct?

207
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:13,937
Yes.

208
00:12:13,938 --> 00:12:16,837
I put it there, so there's no mistake about it.

209
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:19,337
After that, the candles were blown out,

210
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,937
the room got dark,

211
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:24,837
and the lights were switched back on again right away?

212
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:27,138
I turned the lights back on with that switch over there.

213
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:34,637
How long was it pitch dark?

214
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:37,137
I think it was no more than 4 to 5 seconds,

215
00:12:37,138 --> 00:12:39,937
because I got up and turned on the lights

216
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:41,837
right after the candles were all blown out.

217
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:43,937
Do you all agree?

218
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:45,337
Well...

219
00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:47,537
I think so, too.

220
00:12:47,538 --> 00:12:50,337
Then, the answer is simple.

221
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:51,338
The only one who could pour poison in the cup

222
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:52,637
within a period of 4 to 5 seconds

223
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,237
would be the one who was sitting to the right of the victim.

224
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:56,237
That is the one who was nearest to the cup.

225
00:12:56,238 --> 00:12:59,238
No one other than you, Mr. Nonaka!

226
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:01,537
Dad.

227
00:13:01,538 --> 00:13:04,237
It... it doesn't have to me.

228
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:07,637
Even Yuki could've reached the glass if she leaned over.

229
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:09,137
Why should I do something like that?

230
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:12,237
Inspector, it's true that from where Ms. Kojima was seated,

231
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:14,638
she could've done so, too.

232
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:18,037
Oh, no.

233
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:20,037
I couldn't have done it.

234
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:24,737
I'd have to climb over to the table or something to reach the cup.

235
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:27,037
Or, you went around behind everybody,

236
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:29,037
came all the way here

237
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:31,938
and went back to turn on the lights.

238
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:38,137
No, 4 to 5 seconds isn't enough time.

239
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:39,737
Even if it were dark,

240
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:42,537
I'm sure somebody would've sensed you do so if you did.

241
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:47,637
Which means that Mr. Togashi couldn't have done it after all.

242
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:51,037
Inspector. I guess it would be safe to say

243
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,337
that the killer is either Mr. Nonaka or Ms. Kojima.

244
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:54,837
Yes.

245
00:13:54,838 --> 00:13:57,837
No.

246
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:58,938
Why...

247
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:04,038
why did that person take such a strange attitude?

248
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:14,938
Wait a second. If that method is used...

249
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:17,437
I got it.

250
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:20,438
I figured out the method of how the poison was put inside the cup.

251
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:30,256
Inspector Megure.

252
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:35,355
I checked the belongings of the three.

253
00:14:35,356 --> 00:14:38,156
And found this is in Mr. Nonaka's bag.

254
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:41,356
Just what is it?

255
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:44,955
That's the bottle that I...

256
00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:47,255
There could be poison inside.

257
00:14:47,256 --> 00:14:49,255
We'll check it out right away.

258
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:50,756
Please do.

259
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:54,155
So, Mr. Nonaka.

260
00:14:54,156 --> 00:14:56,255
Will you please explain the bottle that we just found?

261
00:14:56,256 --> 00:14:57,955
I know nothing about it.

262
00:14:57,956 --> 00:15:00,455
That's my bag all right,

263
00:15:00,456 --> 00:15:02,855
but it's the first time I've ever seen that tiny bottle.

264
00:15:02,856 --> 00:15:05,655
That's what they all say,

265
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:09,655
"I know nothing of it. It's the first time I've seen it".

266
00:15:09,656 --> 00:15:11,555
Officer Takagi!

267
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:13,655
What is it, Conan?

268
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:14,856
There is one thing...

269
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:18,355
What? The same thing?

270
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:20,255
Yes, sir. As to the detailed substance,

271
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:22,855
I'll go back to headquarters and analyze it.

272
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,155
This was found in Ms. Sawaguchi's glass

273
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:27,455
and this was found in the tiny bottle.

274
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:30,756
The reaction of both is exactly the same.

275
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:35,455
Mr. Nonaka, we'd like to hear more details from you so.

276
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:37,155
I... I didn't do it!

277
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:39,355
Somebody stuck the stuff into my bag!

278
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,555
Please calm down, Mr. Nonaka!

279
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:43,055
Please come with me to the station!

280
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:44,755
No good.

281
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:46,355
Please hear me out, inspector!

282
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:49,055
I've never seen that bottle, honestly!

283
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:50,656
Please believe me!

284
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:01,356
Please wait, inspector!

285
00:16:02,156 --> 00:16:03,855
What is it, Mouri?

286
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:05,355
Inspector.

287
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:07,355
Hey, that pose?

288
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:09,955
That's the Sleeping Kogoro.

289
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:13,655
I've figured out who the real killer is, inspector.

290
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:15,355
Real killer?

291
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:17,755
He's not the one?

292
00:16:17,756 --> 00:16:20,355
Are you saying that it's her?

293
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:21,455
I didn't...

294
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:24,255
No. It's not her.

295
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:25,755
Then, is it Mr. Togashi?

296
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:29,255
But Dad, I thought you said he didn't have the chance

297
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,555
to insert the poison just a while ago, didn't you?

298
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:35,455
No, the poison was not inserted afterwards,

299
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:38,155
but rather, was in the glass, to begin with.

300
00:16:38,156 --> 00:16:41,255
Cut it out. I drank out of the cup myself,

301
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:43,455
but I'm alive and kicking as you can see for yourself.

302
00:16:43,456 --> 00:16:45,955
That's just it, Mr. Togashi!

303
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:50,055
That's the very reason why I was suspicious of you to start with.

304
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:51,355
What?

305
00:16:51,356 --> 00:16:53,455
When someone who drank the same wine as you

306
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:55,855
starts to suffer in agony,

307
00:16:55,856 --> 00:16:58,155
even if you didn't drink the poison,

308
00:16:58,156 --> 00:17:00,155
you would be worried nonetheless

309
00:17:00,156 --> 00:17:03,355
and get sick for real.

310
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,655
I see. Come to think of it, that's true.

311
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:09,455
But, you acted differently.

312
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:12,155
Ms. Sawaguchi drank the poison

313
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,056
and collapsed right before your eyes, yet you...

314
00:17:16,556 --> 00:17:18,955
No, I'm fine.

315
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:24,955
You were completely sure that you didn't drink the poison.

316
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:26,455
Why?

317
00:17:26,456 --> 00:17:32,955
Because you're the one who used a trick to poison Ms. Sawaguchi.

318
00:17:32,956 --> 00:17:36,256
So, there's no mistake about it, Mr. Togashi.

319
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:40,155
Cut out the gibberish!

320
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:42,455
If the poison was in there, to begin with,

321
00:17:42,456 --> 00:17:45,155
I would've been poisoned, too.

322
00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:47,156
Right, Yuki?

323
00:17:49,456 --> 00:17:53,655
Just a while ago, Conan found one empty container of gum syrup

324
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:57,356
from the basket in the kitchen.

325
00:17:57,956 --> 00:18:01,755
The thing is, the murder is possible if gum syrup is used.

326
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:04,355
Even if the poisoned wine were to be drunk,

327
00:18:04,356 --> 00:18:08,855
the first sip can be drunk without drinking the poison.

328
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:11,555
Is... is that true, Mr. Mouri?

329
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:15,255
Yes. First, gum syrup is put into the glass,

330
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:19,455
then the poison, and the liquid is stirred.

331
00:18:19,456 --> 00:18:21,855
Back then, in one of the five glasses

332
00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:24,355
that Mr. Togashi brought from the kitchen,

333
00:18:24,356 --> 00:18:28,455
gum syrup was inside.

334
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:32,555
The bottom part of that glass was colored.

335
00:18:32,556 --> 00:18:36,356
Therefore, there was no worry of anyone noticing it.

336
00:18:37,556 --> 00:18:38,955
I see.

337
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:43,055
Moreover, he poured the wine in slowly.

338
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,055
Even if you pour wine over the gum syrup

339
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:46,655
which is heavier than the wine,

340
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:49,755
they won't mix and the wine stays on top of the gum syrup.

341
00:18:49,756 --> 00:18:53,455
In other words, the poison won't mix with the wine.

342
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:55,255
I see.

343
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:57,855
It's the same principle as when you put gum syrup into iced coffee

344
00:18:57,856 --> 00:19:01,155
and it sinks to the bottom of the cup.

345
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:03,355
Then, after the toast,

346
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:06,255
Mr. Togashi drank the wine for everyone to see.

347
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:10,755
After which he deliberately tipped over Ms. Sawaguchi's wine glass.

348
00:19:10,756 --> 00:19:13,855
By giving her his own glass,

349
00:19:13,856 --> 00:19:18,155
he made her drink the poison that was at the bottom of the glass cup.

350
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,655
Togashi!

351
00:19:20,656 --> 00:19:22,655
No, it's not me.

352
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:26,255
Mr. Mouri, all you just said is based only on assumption!

353
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:29,155
Do you have any proof that I did it?

354
00:19:29,156 --> 00:19:32,855
Did you get the fingerprints I asked you for, Officer Tome?

355
00:19:32,856 --> 00:19:38,155
Yes. There were no fingerprints on the sides of the bottle.

356
00:19:38,156 --> 00:19:43,255
But, Conan's fingerprints were found on the bottom of the bottle.

357
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:44,555
What?

358
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:46,255
Before the party started,

359
00:19:46,256 --> 00:19:50,455
I goofed and turned your bag upside down, Mr. Togashi.

360
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:54,155
And at that time, a bottle just like that one came rolling out

361
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:56,855
so I put it right back into the bag.

362
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:59,455
Like this, so it wouldn't drop.

363
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:01,655
Huh? But, it's strange.

364
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:04,455
I put it back inside Mr. Togashi's bag

365
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:07,756
and yet, why is it in Mr. Nonaka's camera bag?

366
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:13,355
Conan, thank you. There's nothing strange about it.

367
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:14,955
Why not?

368
00:20:14,956 --> 00:20:19,056
Because he sneaked that bottle into Mr. Nonaka's bag.

369
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:23,856
Mr. Togashi, isn't it right?

370
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:29,955
Mr. Togashi, you must've worked very carefully

371
00:20:29,956 --> 00:20:33,055
not to leave your fingerprints behind.

372
00:20:33,056 --> 00:20:37,856
That's why you didn't bother to wipe off the fingerprints at the end.

373
00:20:42,856 --> 00:20:46,755
I used to date Keiko 2 years ago.

374
00:20:46,756 --> 00:20:52,055
She kept on asking me to get her expensive presents during that time.

375
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:55,055
I kept giving her stuff despite having to go into debt.

376
00:20:55,056 --> 00:20:59,455
Then, in the end, that darn woman had the nerve to switch over to Nonaka.

377
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:03,156
She dumped me as if I were a worn-out rag or something.

378
00:21:04,156 --> 00:21:08,455
I've been waiting for today.

379
00:21:08,456 --> 00:21:12,155
Her 20th birthday.

380
00:21:12,156 --> 00:21:16,155
I planned it out carefully to poison Keiko

381
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:22,956
and then schemed to frame you, Nonaka, up as the killer.

"Mouri Detective Agency"

383
00:23:04,256 --> 00:23:06,355
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

384
00:23:06,356 --> 00:23:08,055
Dad!

385
00:23:08,056 --> 00:23:11,155
Sonoko came back from Germany yesterday

386
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,955
and she brought a bottle of wine as a souvenir.

387
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,155
Would you like to drink it?

388
00:23:14,156 --> 00:23:16,255
Wine?

389
00:23:16,256 --> 00:23:18,356
Sure!

390
00:23:24,356 --> 00:23:27,656
It sure is good!

391
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:32,655
I'm so lucky that it tastes just like the one we had last week.

392
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:35,056
-Ran... -What?

393
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:38,855
Oh, you're right.

394
00:23:38,856 --> 00:23:42,856
Well... expensive things sure suit my taste buds.

395
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:47,456
I made a mistake and gave him the cheap wine I got at a shop nearby.

396
00:23:49,356 --> 00:23:50,755
Cheers!

397
00:23:50,756 --> 00:23:52,856
Who cares? Since he seems to be enjoying himself.

398
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:59,656
Cheap stuff is just the thing for Pops' taste buds.

399
00:24:01,956 --> 00:24:06,955
"Next Episode"

400
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:09,755
Then, when you passed here about 7 pm,

401
00:24:09,756 --> 00:24:12,755
there was nobody lying on the road?

402
00:24:12,756 --> 00:24:14,455
A bicycle?

403
00:24:14,456 --> 00:24:16,555
This is...

404
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:18,755
Let's go see the place

405
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:22,055
where you all say you were watching the fireworks.

406
00:24:22,056 --> 00:24:25,556
There are bicycle wheel traces near the broken fence.

407
