1
00:00:00,172 --> 00:00:01,272
Here!

2
00:00:03,172 --> 00:00:05,072
Got it!

3
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:06,872
Nice catch!

4
00:00:06,872 --> 00:00:09,272
Fantastic, Shinpei!

5
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:10,372
"Shinpei Asakawa (21)" -Okay.

6
00:00:10,372 --> 00:00:12,472
Next, it's your turn, Conan!

7
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:14,472
Here it comes.

8
00:00:26,172 --> 00:00:30,372
Come on, stop that...

9
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:31,972
Ma... Matsunosuke?

10
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:33,872
Matsunosuke...

11
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:36,272
Stop it, Matsunosuke.

12
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:43,072
Good morning, granny.

13
00:00:43,072 --> 00:00:44,572
Granny...

14
00:00:44,572 --> 00:00:45,572
"Kanae Asakawa (65)" -Shinpei.

15
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:49,572
You're playing from morning without working again?

16
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:52,172
Playing? I'm not really.

17
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:54,372
He wasn't playing!

18
00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:58,272
He teaches us how to throw frisbee here every week!

19
00:00:58,272 --> 00:01:01,172
He is really kind!

20
00:01:01,172 --> 00:01:04,572
It's the same as playing, isn't it? You're an adult.

21
00:01:04,572 --> 00:01:10,372
Thanks to you, even Matsunosuke has learned to catch frisbees.

22
00:01:10,372 --> 00:01:13,072
Is that dog's name Matsunosuke?

23
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:14,272
How cute.

24
00:01:14,272 --> 00:01:17,972
Well... you're all soiled.

25
00:01:17,972 --> 00:01:21,272
I'll return it to you after it's cleaned.

26
00:01:21,272 --> 00:01:24,272
It's okay, don't worry about it.

27
00:01:24,272 --> 00:01:27,772
No, this have to be taken care of nicely.

28
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:31,672
I don't want your parents complaining to me later.

29
00:01:31,672 --> 00:01:34,272
Granny, you're going to eat breakfast, aren't you?

30
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:37,072
Won't you serve me breakfast too?

31
00:01:37,072 --> 00:01:38,472
Only after you start working

32
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:41,272
and repay me the money I lent you.

33
00:01:41,272 --> 00:01:43,772
All right.

34
00:02:04,072 --> 00:02:05,972
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

35
00:02:05,972 --> 00:02:07,972
are slashed by the light of deduction.

36
00:02:07,972 --> 00:02:09,972
Walking the dog along the same route every morning.

37
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,972
A slight difference causes an incident.

38
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:13,572
He sees through the one and only truth.

39
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:15,372
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

40
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:17,772
His name is Detective Conan!

41
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:50,053
"Suspicious Promenade"

42
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,290
"Kanae Asakawa, Matsunosuke"

43
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,990
Granny, are you home?

44
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,690
We came to get Conan's clothes.

45
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,290
She doesn't seem to be home.

46
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,290
Maybe she's out walking the dog?

47
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,790
I guess so. We should come back again.

48
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,690
But, it seems like Matsunosuke's sleeping over there.

49
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,590
You're right.

50
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,390
He is sleeping so soundly.

51
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,290
He's not moving at all.

52
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,690
Is Matsunosuke sleeping?

53
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,690
I was just thinking of giving him a snack.

54
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,590
Who are you?

55
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,990
"Tomoko Hirota (52)" -Friend of Kanae.

56
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,390
I own Matsunosuke's sibling.

57
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,390
What? Matsunosuke has siblings? Do they look alike?

58
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,690
Of course. Exactly alike.

59
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,190
Hey... Don't tell me...

60
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,890
Conan?

61
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,390
It's open?

62
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,790
Kanae.

63
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,990
What's all the fuss about?

64
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,990
It's so noisy that I can't concentrate.

65
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,990
I told you, we came to get Conan's clothes,

66
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,590
and found that Matsunosuke asleep!

67
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,690
He won't wake up no matter how much we call him.

68
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,290
What? Matsunosuke?

69
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,490
It's the dog!

70
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,690
The one sleeping in the kennel outside.

71
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,690
According to the forensics, it seems to have been drugged.

72
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,290
Drugged?

73
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,690
You're Ms. Hirota, a friend of hers, aren't you?

74
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,190
Yes, I came to share snacks with the dog.

75
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,690
Then...

76
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,990
And you're Mr. Kitazawa who lives next door?

77
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,690
"Sokichi Kitazawa (54)" -Yes, I was wondering what's going on

78
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,090
because the doorbell kept ringing and I saw this.

79
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,890
Do you two know each other?

80
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,590
Yes.

81
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,390
Ms. Hirota, I hear that you owed Kanae a lot of money.

82
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:13,590
She was always complaining, saying that you wouldn't pay her back.

83
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,390
I'll bet you're the one who did it.

84
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,290
Speak for yourself. I've heard you were always complaining about her too!

85
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,890
You told everyone her dog was too noisy.

86
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,590
What? Are you saying that I'm the murderer?

87
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,890
Cut out the joke!

88
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,390
Speak for yourself!

89
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,790
Well... calm down.

90
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,390
Inspector Megure, it seems that between 08:00 to 08:15 this morning,

91
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,290
various people at the shopping arcade and park

92
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,190
witnessed Mrs. Asakawa walking her dog.

93
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,290
Okay.

94
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,990
Do you know the route that Mrs. Asakawa usually walks her dog?

95
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,590
I remember she mentioned that after she leaves home,

96
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,390
she goes to the shopping arcade, then heads to the park.

97
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,990
Then, she walks along the street and returns home.

98
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,990
Yes, she used to say it's best for her

99
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,290
to walk the dog about an hour.

100
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,690
If so...

101
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,590
She left the house before 08:00 am,

102
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,590
and finished walking her dog and came home at about 09:00 am.

103
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,190
She would've been killed after that.

104
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,990
What were the two of you doing during this time?

105
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,590
I was at home playing shogi with an acquaintance.

106
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,090
I was at home too.

107
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,590
I had the florist deliver me some flowers.

108
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,890
And, I asked them to arrange the flowers for me.

109
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,290
My jacket is back from the dry cleaners.

110
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,790
A beige spring coat.

111
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,290
It's the coat she was wearing when she died.

112
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,690
A pack of ready-made food. Is that for her breakfast?

113
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,690
What? But didn't Shinpei say...

114
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,890
Inspector, please come.

115
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,290
What's wrong?

116
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,290
Take a look at this.

117
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,690
A bandana.

118
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,990
Is that a blood stain?

119
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,690
Hey, isn't that?

120
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,890
Yes.

121
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,390
Shinpei's bandana!

122
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,990
Shinpei?

123
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,690
Kanae's grandson.

124
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,990
Inspector Megure!

125
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,590
She says she saw a man flee from this house.

126
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,890
What?

127
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,590
I'm sorry, will you repeat what you told me a while ago?

128
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,190
Yes, sir.

129
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,890
I think it was after 09:00 am,

130
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,990
a young man came out of this house.

131
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,990
He looked stark pale and fled.

132
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,190
I remember that he is Mrs. Kanae's grandson.

133
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,390
Do you know where he lives?

134
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,990
I heard that he was living on his own in an apartment nearby.

135
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,290
Okay, let's interrogate him right away.

136
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,190
Yes, sir.

137
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,290
Impossible!

138
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,990
Shinpei would never commit murder!

139
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,590
It's some kind of mistake!

140
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,390
How terrible to call Shinpei the murderer!

141
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,690
He was so passionate about teaching us how to throw frisbees...

142
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,490
It's not possible! No way!

143
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,990
Hey, Genta!

144
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,390
What's with you at a time like this?

145
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,390
It's not me.

146
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,190
Shinpei?

147
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,790
Conan?

148
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,390
Hey, you! The police are looking for you.

149
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,690
About granny, right?

150
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,290
Yes, they say you're the murderer.

151
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,790
No, I'm not! I didn't do it!

152
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,390
But, you fled from the site, didn't you?

153
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,390
Well, granny texted me to come over.

154
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,990
But when I got there, she was already...

155
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,790
I rushed outside and bumped into somebody.

156
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,290
I have no idea what happened after that.

157
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,990
Shinpei, you mentioned that granny will having breakfast

158
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,690
was after she finished walking Matsunosuke, didn't you?

159
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,790
What? Yes.

160
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,990
She used to say she felt better eating after exercising.

161
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,990
Here he is!

162
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,890
No! It's not me!

163
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,990
Shinpei got caught!

164
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,690
Hey, Conan!

165
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,690
Why aren't you doing anything about it?

166
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,390
I've got no choice, right?

167
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,090
Shinpei's bandana was at the site of the crime

168
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,090
and there's even a witness.

169
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,690
No way.

170
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,190
Do you think that Shinpei is the murderer, too?

171
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,590
I despise you!

172
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,790
But...

173
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,190
There's a continuation to your story, isn't there?

174
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,790
Sort of...

175
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,990
First of all, the bandana that was found at the site

176
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,190
is not something special

177
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,190
so anyone could get one if they wanted to.

178
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:09,990
I see. It could be the real murderer put it there to frame Shinpei.

179
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,190
But that won't be enough.

180
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,290
I found a plastic bag with a tag

181
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,990
from the dry cleaners in the trash box at the site.

182
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:24,190
"Woman's beige spring coat" is written on the tag.

183
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,590
A beige spring coat?

184
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,590
The coat that granny was wearing when she died!

185
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,690
Right.

186
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,990
And under that plastic bag,

187
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,090
a pack of ready-made food for breakfast was disposed.

188
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,390
A pack of ready-made food for breakfast under the plastic bag?

189
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,690
Which means she disposed of the pack of food for breakfast first, right?

190
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,190
So, she took Matsunosuke for a walk after she ate breakfast.

191
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,290
It's the other way around...

192
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,690
Exactly!

193
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:57,690
According to Shinpei, granny always eats breakfast

194
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,390
after finishing her walk with Matsunosuke,

195
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,290
but the circumstances at the site shows that it was the other way around.

196
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,590
In other words, there's a possibility that someone manipulated the scene.

197
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,590
But what if Shinpei's lying?

198
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,390
No way.

199
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:16,790
He talked about granny's breakfast last week too, didn't he?

200
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,490
Granny, you're going to eat breakfast, aren't you?

201
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,490
Won't you serve me breakfast too?

202
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,290
If that was a lie,

203
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,990
he must've planned the crime in advance.

204
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,690
So, he would never drop a blood stained bandana there, right?

205
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,190
You might be right.

206
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,190
Then who could've done it?

207
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,390
The only suspects we have right now are her friend, Ms. Hirota,

208
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,990
and her next door neighbour, Mr. Kitazawa.

209
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,390
But, both of them have alibis.

210
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,690
Then, why don't we investigate whether their alibis are true?

211
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:48,290
I see! If we do so, Shinpei may be able to come back!

212
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,590
It's showtime for the Youth Detective Squad!

213
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,690
-Yes! -Yes!

214
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,390
I'll start with Mr. Kitazawa's house.

215
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,390
Then we'll go and ask around the shopping arcade.

216
00:12:58,269 --> 00:12:59,969
No waiting, okay?

217
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:02,469
Shut up! I know!

218
00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:05,469
Here it comes! There!

219
00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:10,469
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:13,569
Our frisbee went inside, could you pick it up for us?

221
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:14,869
Geez...

222
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:16,169
I'm so sorry.

223
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,469
Okay...

224
00:13:17,469 --> 00:13:19,469
Go around to the front door.

225
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:23,969
I'm sorry, sir. The frisbee...

226
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,969
You're playing shogi!

227
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:28,569
Good match!

228
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:31,469
Since when have you been playing?

229
00:13:31,469 --> 00:13:32,969
From this morning!

230
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:34,969
Amazing!

231
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:37,269
I've won 99 games and lost 99 games

232
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:38,569
in the past 10 years!

233
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,269
Today is the day to decide who the stronger player is.

234
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:43,269
We've been playing against each other

235
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:45,969
from 06:00 in the morning non-stop.

236
00:13:45,969 --> 00:13:47,969
You're on the verge of losing.

237
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:50,769
Shut up! Don't get in the way of our game!

238
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:53,469
I'm... I'm sorry!

239
00:13:54,469 --> 00:13:56,969
Yes, at 08:30 am!

240
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:01,969
I was told by Ms. Hirota to deliver the flowers then.

241
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:04,169
Arrangement and all?

242
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:06,969
Yes, since there were a lot of flowers,

243
00:14:06,969 --> 00:14:09,469
it took till about after 12:00 pm.

244
00:14:09,469 --> 00:14:11,269
I see.

245
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:16,969
Their alibis were fully established after all.

246
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:19,369
So, what now, Conan?

247
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:23,369
They're going to make Shinpei the murderer.

248
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:28,369
Maybe the prerequisite circumstance was wrong to begin with.

249
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:30,669
Prerequisite circumstance?

250
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,869
I first thought that victim was killed

251
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:38,169
after she came back from her walk with Matsunosuke.

252
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,669
Just what do you mean?

253
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:42,269
Granny used to walk the dog along the same road

254
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:45,169
at the same time every morning.

255
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:47,869
That's why maybe...

256
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:50,269
I see! The people who witnessed her

257
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:53,169
may have thought they saw her like always today too!

258
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:57,769
Oh, the woman wearing the beige coat walking the dog, right?

259
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:59,969
I saw her this morning too.

260
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:01,969
Are you sure it was this morning?

261
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:04,569
Yes, It must've been after 08:00 am.

262
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:08,169
We always go pass each other when I walked my dog.

263
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:12,269
That dog always marks that pole.

264
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:14,969
But, it seems that she was in a rush today

265
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:17,969
and pulled forcibly on the dog then took him with her.

266
00:15:17,969 --> 00:15:18,969
Yes.

267
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:21,969
The lady that walks her dog every morning, right?

268
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:23,069
I saw her.

269
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:25,169
They really had it out this morning.

270
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:26,569
Had it out?

271
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:30,969
That dog always fights with a cat in front of this store.

272
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:33,569
This morning it was really bad.

273
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:37,869
She's been trying to keep the dog away from the cat these days

274
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:40,469
but it seems she was a bit off her guard.

275
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:44,269
It takes 15 minutes to get here from her house.

276
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:46,969
Everybody's saying that the she went by with the dog.

277
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:51,869
Which means they weren't just imagining.

278
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:59,269
Ma'am.

279
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:01,469
Yes. What is it?

280
00:16:01,469 --> 00:16:05,469
Did you see a woman walking her dog around here this morning?

281
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:09,669
What? The police asked me the same thing.

282
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,369
I did, I'm sure of it.

283
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:15,969
Was that woman pulling the dog along with force?

284
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:17,769
With force?

285
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,769
Yes, it did seem like she was.

286
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:24,669
She always goes left after leaving the park.

287
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:26,369
But, this morning,

288
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:29,969
she pulled her dog along as she turned right.

289
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:31,869
She pulled it to the right?

290
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:33,669
Hold on, Conan.

291
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:36,269
This is opposite the walking course.

292
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:39,469
There's no way we can find witnesses then.

293
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,569
This is...

294
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:49,069
Oh, it's you kids.

295
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:52,969
Are you still looking for eye-witnesses?

296
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:55,469
Oh, you're the one we saw a while ago.

297
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:59,469
I couldn't tell who you were because you didn't have your dog with you.

298
00:16:59,469 --> 00:17:03,169
I see! I get the picture.

299
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:05,569
Everybody's made a mistake.

300
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:07,269
Even the witness...

301
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:09,469
and the murderer too.

302
00:17:10,469 --> 00:17:14,469
Then there's one place the murderer will have to go...

303
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,569
in order to hide the vital evidence.

304
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:30,869
Good evening.

305
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:36,069
Why are you here so late?

306
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:38,269
You kids.

307
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:43,569
Ma'am. We figured out the real murderer

308
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:46,769
that killed Mrs. Kanae.

309
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:50,469
The murderer killed Mrs. Kanae

310
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:54,569
who finished preparing her breakfast before 08:00 am.

311
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:58,269
After that, the murderer cleaned up the breakfast that was prepared

312
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:02,569
and dressed her in the coat that had just came back from the dry cleaners

313
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:06,269
to make it look as if she was killed after she walking her dog.

314
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:08,569
Then the murderer put Shinpei's bandana

315
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:12,169
that had prepared beforehand at the front entrance,

316
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:17,169
disguised as Mrs. Kanae and took Matsunosuke for a walk.

317
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:21,869
To create eye-witnesses believe that she was walking Matsunosuke,

318
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,969
and establish the alibi...

319
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:26,969
Of course, it was a simple disguise,

320
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:29,569
so they might've been found out if someone paid attention,

321
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:33,969
but they were all deceived by having Matsunosuke along.

322
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:36,269
The dog pees and marks the usual place,

323
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:39,469
fights with the cat as usual.

324
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:44,469
So, everyone believes it's the granny walking Matsunosuke as usual.

325
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:51,169
But the murderer turned right after leaving the park.

326
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:53,469
Though granny's always turns left.

327
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:57,569
Of course, because if the murderer walking the dog as usual,

328
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,469
she wouldn't be able to establish the alibi.

329
00:19:00,469 --> 00:19:05,169
The murderer who left the park, went home along with Matsunosuke,

330
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:09,369
met the person she had summoned and completed her alibi.

331
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:11,969
Hold it there. What about the dog?

332
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:14,069
What about Matsunosuke?

333
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,769
Back then, Matsunosuke was asleep over here, wasn't he?

334
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:18,569
The murderer couldn't have taken him.

335
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:20,769
It was a fake.

336
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:23,569
The dog that was drugged to sleep back then

337
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:27,469
was a fake Matsunosuke that the murderer got ready.

338
00:19:27,469 --> 00:19:29,769
This means that the murderer owns a dog

339
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,269
that looks like Matsunosuke!

340
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:36,769
You said you own one of Matsunosuke's siblings, right?

341
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:39,069
One that looks exactly like Matsunosuke.

342
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:42,469
In other words, you're the only one who could be the murderer,

343
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:44,469
Ms. Tomoko Hirota!

344
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:46,769
Conan.

345
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,769
Inspector!

346
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:53,769
Please help me. These kids suddenly saying strange things.

347
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:57,069
We came because Mr. Mouri contacted us.

348
00:19:57,069 --> 00:20:02,669
Yes! He couldn't come because of something urgent

349
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,569
so he told us to come and tell you instead.

350
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:09,869
I see. I hope you have evidence though.

351
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:11,969
That's right! Evidence!

352
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:13,869
Show the proof!

353
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:16,869
The proof is right there.

354
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:20,269
The dog that you switched with your own,

355
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:23,169
the real Matsunosuke!!

356
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:25,869
How about it, Ms. Hirota?

357
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:28,569
No, they're wrong!

358
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:30,469
This is my dog!

359
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:32,569
Matsunosuke is tied up over there.

360
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:34,569
Hey, Matsunosuke!

361
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:36,569
Here it comes!

362
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:46,269
-He did it! -He did it!

363
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:52,069
Ma'am.

364
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:56,069
I'll bet you think that we got to the truth because of the dog?

365
00:20:56,069 --> 00:20:57,769
But, that's what it is, right?

366
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:00,469
If that stupid dog didn't go after that frisbee...

367
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,669
You're wrong.

368
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:05,669
After you killed Mrs. Kanae,

369
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:08,569
you cleaned up the breakfast and put the coat on her.

370
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,569
Then you set the place up to make it look as if she was killed

371
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,869
after she came back from walking her dog.

372
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:17,269
That was your biggest mistake.

373
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:20,269
Mrs. Kanae always used to eat breakfast

374
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:23,069
after walking her dog.

375
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:26,169
That's why if she was killed right after she got home,

376
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:29,669
the breakfast preparation would've had to be left as is.

377
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:32,769
And if she was killed after she ate breakfast,

378
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:36,869
it would be strange for her to still be wearing the coat.

379
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:38,869
In other words, that site

380
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:42,869
was a site full of awkward, unnatural settings.

381
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:08,269
But I'm glad that we found the real murderer.

382
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:11,569
We can have Shinpei teach us to throw frisbee again.

383
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:14,269
That's right. I can't wait!

384
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:17,269
You even got your jacket back all clean.

385
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:22,769
Yes, Matsunosuke's footprints are all cleaned off...

386
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:29,469
I'm sorry, Conan.

387
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:32,769
I'll take it to the dry cleaners again.

388
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:34,969
No, don't bother already.

389
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:39,569
"Next Episode" -Here you go, detective!

390
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:41,969
Drink this for the time being.

391
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:45,769
You'll soon lose track of what's real and what's not

392
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:46,869
and end up being cooped up,

393
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:49,469
then eventually hang yourself to death!

394
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:57,969
Mr. Usuda's not moving as if he's dead!

395
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:01,169
He's really dead.

396
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:03,569
Next Conan,

397
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:06,569
