1
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:17,934
"Ms. Masudo's Dressing Room."

2
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:34,034
How is it?

3
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:36,734
Well...

4
00:00:38,134 --> 00:00:41,634
Is there anybody that you do not know?

5
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:46,533
Is there?

6
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:47,833
Yes.

7
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:50,333
I have never seen that person.

8
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:53,934
The man with tanned skin, brown hair and sunglasses.

9
00:00:55,734 --> 00:01:00,333
And also that skinny man with bobbed hair.

10
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:04,733
And the man with the beard and glasses.

11
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:07,133
That's all.

12
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:10,733
I think the last guy is the most suspicious one.

13
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:13,633
Huh? Why do you say so, Ran?

14
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:17,033
Because he was taking pictures of a lot of people

15
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:19,634
saying that they looked like his friend or something like that.

16
00:01:20,634 --> 00:01:25,034
Then he could be my uncle, Uncle Gunji, because he's a photographer.

17
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:31,033
But you don't know what he looks like, right?

18
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:32,333
No.

19
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:35,633
He used to play with me when I was little.

20
00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:40,333
Back then, he was much skinnier and had no beard.

21
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,533
But since he started working internationally as a photographer,

22
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:45,733
I haven't seen him at all.

23
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:48,233
Then what about the other two?

24
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:51,133
Especially that guy who doesn't take off his sunglasses

25
00:01:51,134 --> 00:01:52,134
even inside the building.

26
00:01:53,434 --> 00:01:57,433
Maybe he is my instructor, Mr. Shimabukuro,

27
00:01:57,434 --> 00:02:00,833
who gave me snowboarding lessons before.

28
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:04,133
I met Masateru at his snowboarding lesson.

29
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:05,334
That's why we invited him.

30
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,533
I see.

31
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:11,633
I quit snowboarding already though.

32
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:12,833
I think I couldn't recognize him

33
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:16,434
is because his face was always covered with goggles and a hat.

34
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:20,633
I understand.

35
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:23,334
Then what about the man with bobbed hair?

36
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:26,033
All I can think of right now

37
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:28,633
is that he is the administrator of the hot spring website.

38
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:31,233
His name is Mr. Karube, I think.

39
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,233
A hot spring website?

40
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:35,333
Administrator?

41
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:39,633
Inspector, internet sites have administrators.

42
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:42,433
Of course I know that!

43
00:02:42,434 --> 00:02:45,933
He is very shy that he didn't want to come to a party we had before.

44
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:49,933
We talked to him and finally convinced him to attend our wedding,

45
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:52,133
so this is the first time we actually got to see him.

46
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:55,933
But that person seemed to know who you were.

47
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:59,133
He talked to Officer Yumi who was pretending to be you.

48
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:02,833
A few days ago, I sent him a summer gift with my picture in it,

49
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,934
so he should know how I look like.

50
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:07,733
Inspector.

51
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:11,133
I think we have to call them out, get their fingerprints

52
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:14,034
and see if it matches the serial killer's fingerprint.

53
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:15,734
No.

54
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:18,334
They came here for our wedding. We can't do that!

55
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:22,733
But there's no other way to find the killer.

56
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:27,333
Hey, how did you figure out that it was the bad man's fingerprints?

57
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:32,033
The criminal is a suspect of four different homicide cases

58
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:36,233
and his fingerprints were found from one of the murder scenes.

59
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:40,533
We found it on the earring the victim was wearing.

60
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:44,033
There was a piece of gloves on the victim's teeth.

61
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:47,533
Which tells us that the killer put his left hand on the victim's mouth

62
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:50,033
and stabbed the throat but the victim struggled and bit off the gloves.

63
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:52,433
The killer then tried to silence the victim with his bare left hand

64
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:54,133
and that was when he touched her earring.

65
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:58,333
We found the same fingerprints on the cooking knife

66
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:00,333
that the killer left at Ms. Rei's house.

67
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:01,933
Not only we got the fingerprints,

68
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:03,933
but we also got the pattern of his left palm on the knife.

69
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:05,333
That's how we found

70
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:09,133
the fingerprints on the earring was from the killer's left ring finger.

71
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:11,433
Inspector, then the killer wasn't wearing gloves

72
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:13,433
when he broke into Ms. Masudo's house?

73
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:16,033
No, I heard he was wearing gloves.

74
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:19,233
Maybe he grabbed the cooking knife with his bare hand before he broke in.

75
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:20,933
The killer didn't leave any of his murder weapons behind

76
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:23,833
in the first four cases.

77
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:27,333
I guess he didn't think that he would be chased off by Mr. Taira.

78
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,333
So he panicked and forgot to wipe off his fingerprints.

79
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:33,633
Yeah, since no fingerprints were found other than on the cooking knife.

80
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:36,633
Let me ask you, Mr. Taira.

81
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:39,233
Was the front door locked when you came to save Ms. Masudo?

82
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:42,033
No. It was not locked.

83
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:43,933
That's because

84
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:46,333
the house was totally dark,

85
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:48,433
so I was groping around searching for the front door.

86
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:49,934
Then I found the door and opened it.

87
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,933
Is there anything wrong?

88
00:04:54,934 --> 00:04:57,133
No. Actually, I think I saw something.

89
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:58,533
What was it? Tell me.

90
00:04:58,534 --> 00:05:00,233
Please remember.

91
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:03,833
Excuse me, this is not a place for interrogation.

92
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:04,834
Huh?

93
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:07,133
What is it, Ran?

94
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:09,533
Look at those three men.

95
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:14,233
The bobbed hair guy has a bandage on his left pinky and ring finger.

96
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:19,433
The bearded guy with glasses has a Band-Aid on his ring finger.

97
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:21,533
And the one with sunglasses is keeping his left hand

98
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:24,033
in his pocket all the time.

99
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:28,734
They may be trying to avoid leaving their fingerprints anywhere.

100
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:31,433
All right then.

101
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:34,633
Why don't you call them and get their fingerprints or whatever?

102
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:38,333
It will prove whether the killer is here or not.

103
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:41,734
I don't think any of our guests is a criminal though!

104
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:47,134
But Conan is already out there asking around right now.

105
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:52,134
What? Why is that brat always like that?

106
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:55,934
Mouri.

107
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:58,133
Now what?

108
00:05:58,134 --> 00:06:01,033
So what happened to their left hand?

109
00:06:01,034 --> 00:06:03,033
The man who had a bandage on said

110
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:04,933
he sprained his ring finger when he was playing baseball.

111
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:08,233
The one with Band-Aid slammed his hand with the door of his house.

112
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,433
The guy with his hand in his pocket said it's just his habit.

113
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:17,333
That's right, he's wearing sunglasses indoors to hide a stye on his eye.

114
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:19,334
Oh, I remember it now!

115
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:22,933
I saw it.

116
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:26,533
I saw it when Masateru came to save me.

117
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:27,933
It was...

118
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:30,234
It was a stye that I saw on his right eye!

119
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:33,834
What?

120
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:36,334
A stye?

121
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:41,133
Then the man with sunglasses is the serial killer?

122
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,734
But stye usually disappears within a week.

123
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:59,433
A stye.

124
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:04,234
Now I know who the serial killer is.

125
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:11,851
What?

126
00:07:11,852 --> 00:07:15,851
You're telling me maybe the serial killer is here already?

127
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,251
In this wedding ceremony hall?

128
00:07:17,252 --> 00:07:18,351
Yes.

129
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:22,451
He killed one of the guests in order to get the invitation,

130
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:24,552
so he can get in here.

131
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:29,851
You guys are the scapegoat for the bride and groom,

132
00:07:29,852 --> 00:07:31,551
you have to be careful.

133
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:33,851
In fact, I have some other ideas about the suspect as well.

134
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:35,351
What? Other ideas?

135
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:37,451
-What is it? Is there someone else you can think of? -Hey, Yumi.

136
00:07:37,452 --> 00:07:38,951
I need you to do me a favour.

137
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:40,751
What is it?

138
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:44,152
Sorry. Takagi, could you leave us for a moment?

139
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:48,051
It's girl's talk, you know.

140
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:49,451
Oh, okay!

141
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:53,351
I'll go to the washroom. No, I just went to washroom a while ago.

142
00:07:53,352 --> 00:07:54,752
Anyway, I'm going again.

143
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,652
Of course.

144
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,751
I knew it was going to be like this.

145
00:08:09,752 --> 00:08:11,651
So I brought this.

146
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:13,451
See?

147
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,052
Thanks, Yumi.

148
00:08:24,352 --> 00:08:28,351
We can't just judge who the killer is by his face.

149
00:08:28,352 --> 00:08:31,751
Well, Ms. Masudo is not sure who those three guys are,

150
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:34,151
so we should take their fingerprints

151
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:37,951
and see if it matches the killer's before the wedding starts.

152
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,151
Please, you cannot do that.

153
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,351
What if nothing's found?

154
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:42,851
What if they're all innocent?

155
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:44,251
I understand,

156
00:08:44,252 --> 00:08:46,551
but the only information we have about the criminal

157
00:08:46,552 --> 00:08:50,851
is the fact that he had a stye on his right eye.

158
00:08:50,852 --> 00:08:53,651
But that information can't prove anything

159
00:08:53,652 --> 00:08:55,751
because his stye must have healed since it was six months ago.

160
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:58,751
Don't you remember his voice?

161
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:02,651
You heard him saying "I will never forgive you", right?

162
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:06,651
Yeah. But he was wearing a mask so his voice wasn't that clear.

163
00:09:06,652 --> 00:09:08,651
If the voice left an impression,

164
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:11,651
we would've told you six months ago.

165
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:12,751
Inspector Megure.

166
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:16,151
The hall staff is saying that we should start the ceremony soon.

167
00:09:16,152 --> 00:09:18,151
I understand. Let's start then.

168
00:09:18,152 --> 00:09:20,751
-Hey, hey! -We'll be there soon!

169
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:21,851
Wait!

170
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,251
Hey, you...

171
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:24,252
Let's go.

172
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:32,151
Mr. Taira.

173
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:33,152
Mr. Taira!

174
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:36,351
Regardless, the wedding is still going on no matter what happens.

175
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:39,551
If you guys are still worried, why don't you guys attend our ceremony

176
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:42,051
and check what's going on?

177
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:45,351
I really don't expect the killer to show anyway.

178
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,752
Hey, Mr. Taira!

179
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:51,051
Just leave him now.

180
00:09:51,052 --> 00:09:53,751
Let him do whatever he wants to do.

181
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:55,951
You know we cannot do that.

182
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:57,751
Now, I'll tell you what I think about this case,

183
00:09:57,752 --> 00:10:00,351
but it is up to you whether you believe it or not.

184
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:01,652
Okay, Inspector Megure?

185
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:05,152
It is up to you.

186
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:20,152
Huh? How come nobody is around?

187
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:24,752
It's Takagi! I'm coming in!

188
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:29,152
I'm coming in.

189
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:32,552
What? No way!

190
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:35,451
No one's here.

191
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,451
What is this?

192
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:39,851
There you are, Takagi.

193
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:42,651
I just got a call from Inspector Megure.

194
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:46,351
He said you should stay in this room until he tells you what to do.

195
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:48,851
He really said that? What about Yumi?

196
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:52,651
Oh, Inspector gave her instructions and she left.

197
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,251
Okay.

198
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:56,351
But where is she going?

199
00:10:56,352 --> 00:11:01,451
Now here comes the bride, being escorted by her father.

200
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,952
Please welcome with applause.

201
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:19,152
Wait a minute.

202
00:11:21,252 --> 00:11:22,752
It's been half a year, hasn't it?

203
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:25,851
My two friends!

204
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:26,952
That's him!

205
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:29,951
-Arrest him! -Yes, sir...

206
00:11:29,952 --> 00:11:32,951
Hey! Don't you even think about it!

207
00:11:32,952 --> 00:11:35,951
You think I didn't know cops are among those attendants?

208
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:37,251
Don't worry.

209
00:11:37,252 --> 00:11:40,252
I'll disappear after cutting these two people into pieces.

210
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,652
Please, no more stupid acting.

211
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:47,651
Officer?

212
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:48,652
What are you talking about?

213
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:51,752
I'm the one who broke into that girl's house six months ago!

214
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:54,351
Are you joking?

215
00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:57,151
You gotta stop this. You look pathetic.

216
00:11:57,152 --> 00:12:00,252
There's no way that you are the killer.

217
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:03,452
How?

218
00:12:03,453 --> 00:12:07,252
How do you know that he isn't the killer?

219
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:09,751
What do you mean?

220
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:10,851
Six months ago,

221
00:12:10,852 --> 00:12:12,851
when you went to Ms. Rei's house and chased the robber off,

222
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:15,051
the inside of the house was totally dark.

223
00:12:15,052 --> 00:12:17,751
That means it was impossible to recognize him by his appearance.

224
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:20,951
You obviously couldn't know by just looking at him, right?

225
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:22,451
It's the voice.

226
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:23,851
Really?

227
00:12:23,852 --> 00:12:28,151
I thought you said the killer's voice wasn't distinct enough to identify.

228
00:12:28,152 --> 00:12:29,751
I just saw him a while ago.

229
00:12:29,752 --> 00:12:33,251
The police officer who has the same voice as this masked man.

230
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,051
Really? Where did you see him?

231
00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:37,052
I don't know.

232
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:39,551
I think it was inside the building.

233
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:41,251
I have to be right.

234
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:43,551
No one would play such a joke here.

235
00:12:43,552 --> 00:12:45,951
We don't have any friend who would do things like this.

236
00:12:45,952 --> 00:12:49,352
You're right. This guy is my subordinate.

237
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:52,651
But it's weird.

238
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:54,751
He was by the Teimuzu River

239
00:12:54,752 --> 00:12:57,951
and he got here just a minute ago.

240
00:12:57,952 --> 00:12:59,752
It's Officer Chiba.

241
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:02,052
What?

242
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:05,451
Now, let me ask you again.

243
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,551
Why did you think that he was not the serial killer?

244
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:11,051
Well, that's...

245
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:15,751
Also, tell us why you opened the package you received earlier,

246
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:19,351
without even knowing who it was from.

247
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:24,451
Normally, people wouldn't open it without checking what's inside

248
00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:26,351
because there might be some dangerous things in it.

249
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:28,751
What was your confidence based on?

250
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:31,451
Yes. The confidence that made you think

251
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:34,351
that no dangerous objects would be delivered to you,

252
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:37,451
or no such person as "serial killer" would be coming.

253
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:40,451
I know why you were so confident.

254
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,351
Because you already

255
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:44,552
murdered that serial killer...

256
00:13:46,052 --> 00:13:48,452
at the empty warehouse by Teimuzu River.

257
00:13:50,152 --> 00:13:53,452
You murdered the serial killer!

258
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:02,398
Come on! You have to explain it to me!

259
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,998
How come only I have to stay in this dressing room?

260
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:07,698
Well, they are busy right now.

261
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:10,998
Then tell me where Yumi and Ms. Sato went.

262
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:13,198
Just tell me anything.

263
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,698
Sato should be with you right now to protect you.

264
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:17,699
Well, she's not here.

265
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,598
What? Why not?

266
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:22,099
That's why I'm asking because I don't see them here.

267
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,698
Hey, we're on a mission right now.

268
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,799
You got to be more serious, Ms. Sato.

269
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:31,898
What? I murdered the serial killer?

270
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:35,698
All I said was the serial killer wouldn't come to this wedding

271
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:39,298
where all the cops are waiting for him.

272
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:42,898
What does it have to do with murdering him?

273
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:43,998
You know what?

274
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:45,398
Before asking me such dumb questions,

275
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:46,598
you should investigate who those three guys are

276
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,698
because they are people my wife doesn't know.

277
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:50,398
No. They are clean.

278
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,398
Because all those guys talked to Yumi

279
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,199
whom they thought was Ms. Rei.

280
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,598
I'm sorry. You look just like my friend.

281
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,998
Hi, Ms. Masudo.

282
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:03,999
Hey.

283
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:09,798
If one of them murdered and was disguised as the serial killer,

284
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:12,598
he would have avoided contact with the bride until he takes action.

285
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:13,599
That's right.

286
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,798
It is too risky to talk to her

287
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,098
because you don't know what the killer said to the bride.

288
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:20,798
And the bride heard their voice.

289
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,598
They wouldn't know whether she remembers what kind of voice they had.

290
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:27,398
So if the killer did come here,

291
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:30,199
he wouldn't want to talk with her too early.

292
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:37,798
Well, we didn't notice it until Mr. Mouri pointed it out.

293
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:40,098
Then, what about their left ring finger?

294
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:42,498
They were all hiding it, remember?

295
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:44,798
It was just a coincidence.

296
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,698
But let's just that say one of them robbed Ms. Masudo's house.

297
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,098
We found the fingerprint on the cooking knife,

298
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:52,798
but the robber was wearing gloves.

299
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,698
Which means, he touched the knife with his bare hands beforehand.

300
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:58,798
If so, then it is less likely

301
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,598
that they remember which hand touched the cooking knife.

302
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,598
Therefore, they would be hiding both of their hands.

303
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:04,898
Except you, though.

304
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:08,998
You knew that the police was going to ask you about the fingerprint.

305
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:10,798
So you lied that you broke your left thumb and wrist

306
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,298
while struggling with the robber,

307
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:15,598
to hide your left arm with a cast.

308
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,298
That way, you can avoid leaving your fingerprints behind

309
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:19,098
so the police won't suspect you.

310
00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:22,598
You did it because the fingerprint left on that cooking knife was yours.

311
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:27,998
You touched the knife while struggling with the robber.

312
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:31,198
Also, we found only your left hand fingerprint

313
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,298
because your right hand was holding something.

314
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:36,398
Do you remember what Ms. Rei said?

315
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,698
She groped her way through the dark house and ran.

316
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,998
But she was caught by the robber at the door.

317
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:42,998
Then you came to save her

318
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:46,798
and she saw that the robber had a stye on his right eye.

319
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,098
If she could see a stye on his eye when you came to save her,

320
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:55,598
indicates that you were holding a flashlight at the time.

321
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,498
-That tells me... -That tells me...

322
00:16:57,499 --> 00:17:00,198
that he knew that the electric wiring in her house had been cut

323
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:03,798
way before he came to save Ms. Masudo.

324
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:06,999
In conclusion, he was also the robber.

325
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:14,598
Well, luckily, you were fighting the robber on a rug.

326
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,798
Thus, you left only your fingerprint on the cooking knife.

327
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:22,598
Otherwise, your fingerprints may have been on the floor.

328
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:25,498
The reason why you saved Ms. Rei

329
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:31,498
was because you felt sorry for her while robbing her house, right?

330
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:33,098
Being betrayed by him,

331
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:37,598
the robber was waiting for the opportunity for his revenge.

332
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,698
But what you did was you let him break into your house,

333
00:17:40,699 --> 00:17:44,598
display the old data about the wedding on your computer

334
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,898
and make him believe that the wedding was yesterday.

335
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:51,098
Then you found him wandering around this building yesterday,

336
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:52,398
trying to take revenge on you.

337
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:54,598
Saying that you want to apologize,

338
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:59,098
you took him to the warehouse by Teimuzu River and killed him.

339
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:00,998
Well, am I wrong?

340
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:03,598
Yeah, that's almost right.

341
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,098
But the reason I saved this girl

342
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:08,698
was because I could get more money that way than killing her.

343
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:10,198
You! How could you say that?

344
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:14,198
I tried to explain it to that fool.

345
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:16,798
He didn't get it, so I killed him.

346
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,198
All he could do was to open safes. He was a useless man after all.

347
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:23,098
Yes, that's right.

348
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:24,799
Just like the police!

349
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:35,098
Showing a knife in front of a serial killer?

350
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:37,798
You police are helpless!

351
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:38,998
Darn it!

352
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:40,099
Hey, Conan!

353
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:44,199
Don't even think about it!

354
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,598
Only police officers are here other than the bride's father!

355
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:47,798
You cannot run away!

356
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,298
Run away?

357
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:52,598
My life's over once my fingerprints are checked.

358
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,599
If so...

359
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,298
I may as well kill as many people as I can with me

360
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:57,499
to the other side.

361
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,699
Yumi?

362
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:05,999
Yumi!

363
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:09,199
Yumi!

364
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,799
Yumi?

365
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,198
Sorry!

366
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,899
I am not Miwako.

367
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,898
But that's Ms. Sato's clothes, right?

368
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,998
Right! We changed!

369
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:23,598
People didn't notice because I fixed my hair in Japanese style.

370
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,698
You changed your hairstyle?

371
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:28,498
The reason why I was clinging to you

372
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:32,798
was to make Miwako wants to wear a wedding dress.

373
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,298
She was trying hard to become your bride.

374
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,598
Because she has muscles on her back,

375
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,598
the protective vest could not fit in.

376
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,998
So where's Ms. Sato?

377
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,698
I took her to the ceremony hall as Inspector told me to

378
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:49,098
but I don't know what happened later.

379
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:50,099
Yumi!

380
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:03,599
One down.

381
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:08,599
No way!

382
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,098
Did you know?

383
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:17,299
Corset wires are pretty hard.

384
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,599
Miwako?

385
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,599
Sato?

386
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:33,899
Get out of my way!

387
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:35,899
Hey!

388
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,799
I can't use my martial art skills in a wedding dress.

389
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:42,599
Good!

390
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:46,498
I forgot.

391
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:48,298
-Get out of my way, kid! -Conan!

392
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:49,599
Ran, you gotta stop him!

393
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:04,498
I had to do that, right?

394
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:06,399
-I guess so. -Ms. Sato!

395
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,299
Wait!

396
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:18,498
Ms. Sato.

397
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:19,999
It's over!

398
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:22,999
Ms. Sato!

399
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,299
Takagi?

400
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:29,199
Yeah! I got it!

401
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:32,298
Takagi, why?

402
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:34,499
Please, don't ask me.

403
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:42,399
What were you doing, Takagi?

404
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:56,899
Gotta be careful around those ladies. Seriously.

405
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:28,998
Really? You already realized that the groom was suspicious, Officer Sato?

406
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:32,398
Yeah. It wasn't hard to piece everything together.

407
00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:35,298
I noticed the second I saw the video.

408
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:39,698
Even with his wrist and thumb broken, he was able to change fast.

409
00:23:39,699 --> 00:23:44,398
That's why I thought he had a cast on just to hide his fingerprints.

410
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:47,298
Besides, he hid the fact that his house was broken into.

411
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:49,798
I see. If he called the police,

412
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:53,598
they will find out that he's the serial killer by his fingerprints.

413
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:58,098
I figured that the bride shouldn't be beside such a dangerous man.

414
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:01,099
So I became the fake bride instead of Yumi.

415
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:07,098
But you seemed glad to be wearing a wedding dress.

416
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:08,398
Not really.

417
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:10,598
I don't look good in that kind of stuff.

418
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,698
Do you think so?

419
00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:14,498
But it was surprising, wasn't it?

420
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:17,698
Who would have thought the beard man was a famous photographer

421
00:24:17,699 --> 00:24:19,799
who made the poster for the wedding hall?

422
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:26,598
Hey, just hurry past it!

423
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,698
It's so embarrassing. Walk faster, guys!

424
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:29,998
Hurry, hurry!

425
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:32,298
Go on, Yumi. Go, Takagi.

426
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:34,198
Come on, everyone.

427
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:37,698
It was a prophetic dream, but it's over now.

428
00:24:37,699 --> 00:24:39,898
Izawa, Yamamoto and Murakoshi...

429
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:41,899
Okay. Three more people to go.

430
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,798
It's vandalism if you tear it down.

431
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,398
I know that.

432
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:51,399
What were you thinking, Chiba?

433
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:55,798
"Next Episode."

434
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,098
This looks amazing, doesn't it?

435
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:00,098
The sign looks like a haunted house

436
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,398
which you really like!

437
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:04,299
Somebody's trying to kill you?

438
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,498
Hey, wasn't that the signal just now?

439
00:25:11,499 --> 00:25:12,898
It looked that way to me, too!

440
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:13,899
Wait!

441
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:24,099
Next Conan, "Trick Versus Magic (Part 1)"

442
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:41,798
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:44,098
"Stage Light."

444
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:46,598
Which type of wedding ceremony is it?

445
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,999
-Is it a trick or magic? -Are you joking?
