1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,440
A producer was murdered at the new Nichiuri TV building.

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:11,440
Hattori Heiji and I identified the murderers, but the case took a surprising turn.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,030
A connection emerged between the murder victim and a man who died in Kyoto.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,019
Meanwhile, another explosion occurred in Osaka Nanko,

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,020
claiming yet another victim.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,300
The Osaka police's efforts uncovered an important suspect, but...

7
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,419
Hey, are you all right?

8
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,830
Hang in there! Who did this?

9
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,400
This man...

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,749
It's Ishizawa!

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,830
What's going on?

12
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,599
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,429
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

14
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,209
An important suspect becomes a victim!

15
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,309
The bombing cases reach their critical moment!

16
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,859
Always determining the one truth

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,659
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,000
his name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:56,029
Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba (Climax)

20
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,030
Naniwa Police Hospital

21
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:05,340
Doctor, what's Iwazawa's condition?

22
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:08,606
He has bruises all over his body.

23
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:11,616
Most of them are light,

24
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:15,116
but the problem is the blow to the back of his head.

25
00:03:15,117 --> 00:03:17,606
It's a bit troubling.

26
00:03:17,607 --> 00:03:22,607
He'll live, but he'll need total bed rest for a while.

27
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:25,106
Has he regained consciousness?

28
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:27,736
We'd like to question him a little.

29
00:03:27,737 --> 00:03:30,386
Were you listening to what I said?

30
00:03:30,387 --> 00:03:32,497
You won't be able to question him for a while.

31
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:34,316
Isn't there something you can do?

32
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:37,076
He's a suspect in an important case.

33
00:03:37,077 --> 00:03:38,637
There's nothing to be done.

34
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:41,837
If he dies, you'll have nothing.

35
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:46,996
In any case, for now he needs total rest, and he's not receiving any visitors.

36
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:47,987
Got it?

37
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:56,256
Hey, mister.

38
00:03:56,257 --> 00:03:57,017
Huh?

39
00:03:57,387 --> 00:04:02,716
Shouldn't we check out Iwazawa-san's house one more time before returning to the hotel?

40
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:04,596
I'm tired.

41
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:08,266
I'm going back to the hotel, taking a shower, and having a drink.

42
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:13,076
You're saying Ishizawa's condition didn't make the great Mori Kogoro feel anything?

43
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:13,787
Huh?

44
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:20,196
If Ishizawa is the serial bomber, who was keeping him locked up?

45
00:04:20,197 --> 00:04:23,176
Why was Ishizawa covered in bruises?

46
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:25,297
There's a lot of curious mysteries.

47
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:28,056
Once Ishizawa regains consciousness—

48
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:30,426
You're sure you want to wait for a confession?

49
00:04:30,427 --> 00:04:32,767
Aren't you a great detective?

50
00:04:34,997 --> 00:04:36,686
Fine, fine.

51
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:40,406
But we're just taking a quick look and then leaving.

52
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:41,087
Okay.

53
00:04:41,088 --> 00:04:42,296
I'll see you later.

54
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:42,777
Got it.

55
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:46,157
He's not coming with us?

56
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:49,326
He's taking his bike to Kyoto.

57
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:51,537
Kyoto? To do what?

58
00:04:51,797 --> 00:04:52,917
Who knows?

59
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:58,917
Anyway, forensics searched his whole house and didn't find anything.

60
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,797
What am I supposed to find?

61
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:06,177
Isn't it a detective's job to figure that out?

62
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:07,457
I guess.

63
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:11,177
What a filthy kitchen.

64
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:14,676
Now this is what you call a bachelor pad.

65
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:16,937
Ishizawa-san was found here?

66
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:18,117
Yeah.

67
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,516
Where was Ishizawa-san being locked up?

68
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:27,367
I think it was his room on the second floor.

69
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:31,947
Apparently he was held here for a couple of days.

70
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:34,787
They left him without anything to eat or drink.

71
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:39,587
Hey, mister. The lock on this door is broken.

72
00:05:40,787 --> 00:05:43,837
Ishizawa probably kicked it open.

73
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:47,466
Once he left his room,

74
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:52,677
he slipped on the stairs and fell down.

75
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:56,687
That's when he got all those cuts and bruises all over his body.

76
00:05:56,997 --> 00:05:58,187
Probably.

77
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:04,567
I wonder what Ishizawa-san was doing in the kitchen.

78
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:06,886
Isn't it obvious?

79
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:11,697
He was looking for a knife or something to cut the ropes binding him.

80
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:16,486
But look. The front door is right at the bottom of the stairs.

81
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:19,676
He would've been saved immediately if he left through the front door,

82
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:21,717
so why did he go to the kitchen?

83
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,236
He was probably out of his mind.

84
00:06:26,237 --> 00:06:29,587
After all, he'd been locked in a room without food or drink.

85
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:33,097
Now that we've checked the place out, let's go.

86
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:35,847
This is probably why.

87
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:38,457
But what about this?

88
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:43,857
Haibara Ai Message Received

89
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,987
Didn't I ask for okonomiyaki?

90
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:54,737
Sorry. I don't know where to get one.

91
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:57,826
Where's the high school detective of the west?

92
00:06:57,827 --> 00:06:59,867
We're acting separately for now.

93
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:02,497
You should've asked him.

94
00:07:03,137 --> 00:07:04,326
Yeah.

95
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:07,497
Didn't he promise to treat me to okonomiyaki?

96
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:15,007
Now then.

97
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:17,877
This place is bigger than I thought.

98
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:27,826
It's all right.

99
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:31,567
Uh, Haibara? More importantly...

100
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:35,346
The data you asked for is right here.

101
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:36,527
Thanks.

102
00:07:37,277 --> 00:07:39,636
Of the four you mentioned,

103
00:07:39,637 --> 00:07:43,686
I haven't had time for Ishizawa who you tacked on later,

104
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:47,917
but that's almost certainly how the other three are connected.

105
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:51,456
I see.

106
00:07:51,457 --> 00:07:55,606
Yonekura-san, Suemura-san, and Onda-san

107
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:58,927
all carried large amounts of debt at one point.

108
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:05,187
And all three of them paid off their debts exactly ten years ago.

109
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:06,906
Smells fishy.

110
00:08:06,907 --> 00:08:13,576
I thought you'd say that, so I also picked up unsolved cases from the year before.

111
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,197
Good thinking, Haibara.

112
00:08:15,707 --> 00:08:18,736
But there was only a single case

113
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:24,627
committed by four suspects for an amount that would've paid off all their debts.

114
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:30,587
The culprits broke into the mansion by blowing up the back door.

115
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:35,417
After tying up the couple that owned the house and two of their employees,

116
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:39,387
they stole 120 million yen in cash and fled.

117
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:41,116
That's odd.

118
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:42,187
Right?

119
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:49,286
But if the four current victims were the culprits in this robbery,

120
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:52,277
how is that connected to the current case?

121
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:58,317
I doubt the victims from ten years ago are getting their revenge now.

122
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:04,476
Normally you'd assume they had a falling out.

123
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,056
But it was ten years ago.

124
00:09:07,057 --> 00:09:08,627
Why now?

125
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:12,646
A lot can happen in ten years.

126
00:09:12,647 --> 00:09:16,257
Some will succeed, while others will fail.

127
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:20,486
You're right. A lot can happen.

128
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:24,947
Ten years ago, I never thought I'd end up like this.

129
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:30,747
Oh, right. That reminds me...

130
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:36,197
Onda recently had a failed investment and was on the verge of bankruptcy.

131
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:39,567
That's it! At least, I wish I could say that.

132
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:46,047
The problem is that everyone connected to the case has already been killed.

133
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:47,827
There's nothing you can do.

134
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,707
There are four big questions.

135
00:09:51,077 --> 00:09:57,217
Onda-san had two cars, so why was only one of them rigged with explosives?

136
00:09:57,547 --> 00:10:03,877
Why didn't the bomb in Yonekura-san's car have a detonator or timer?

137
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:09,347
How did the culprit know Suemura-san would go to that warehouse?

138
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:14,567
Why was Ishizawa-san locked inside his room and abandoned for several days?

139
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:16,937
And then there's one more.

140
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:21,037
Will there be a fourth bombing?

141
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:31,417
I'll give you ten minutes.

142
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:34,226
Any more than that will tax the patient.

143
00:10:34,227 --> 00:10:35,676
Understood.

144
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,917
Okay, Ishizawa-san.

145
00:10:37,357 --> 00:10:39,456
I'll have a nurse wait outside.

146
00:10:39,457 --> 00:10:41,456
Let them know if you need anything.

147
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:42,297
Okay.

148
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:45,467
You'd better stick to the time limit.

149
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:46,747
Okay.

150
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:49,727
Thanks for the food.

151
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:51,687
Hey.

152
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:52,647
Huh?

153
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:57,216
These bombings are pretty sloppy, aren't they?

154
00:10:57,217 --> 00:10:58,397
Sloppy?

155
00:10:58,697 --> 00:11:03,416
Of the three bomb plots, only the third succeeded.

156
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:07,556
The first exploded on a different day than originally planned,

157
00:11:07,557 --> 00:11:11,296
and someone else killed the target of the second, right?

158
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:12,497
Yeah.

159
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:15,766
Once the first two out of three plans failed,

160
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:22,507
wouldn't you normally postpone the third and come up with a new one?

161
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:26,406
The culprit must either be really confident,

162
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:30,187
or there must be some reason they couldn't postpone their plan.

163
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:33,647
That's it. So that's how it is!

164
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:34,647
Huh?

165
00:11:34,648 --> 00:11:36,616
Thanks, Haibara.

166
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:38,746
You can have my takoyaki.

167
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:39,647
What?

168
00:11:39,857 --> 00:11:42,256
Or should I go get you some more?

169
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:43,137
What?

170
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:44,777
Hattori?

171
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:48,147
I know what you need to look for.

172
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:00,470
Gomera has risen out of the Osaka Bay and is headed straight this way!

173
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,430
Cut!

174
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,390
We're checking the footage.

175
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,169
Watching this is so exciting.

176
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,109
Yeah. Real actors are so cool.

177
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,649
Maybe I'll become an actor, too.

178
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,350
What?

179
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,340
Maybe I'll be in a tiger drama.

180
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,949
It's Taiga, not tiger.

181
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,520
Genta-kun, you can do it.

182
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,340
Is something wrong, Kazuha-chan?

183
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,779
Maybe I got carried away.

184
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,160
You're worried about Hattori-kun?

185
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,439
Gomera and Yaiba were right in front of me.

186
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,290
I couldn't help myself.

187
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,919
It's all right. I'm sure he understands.

188
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,790
Oh, there you are.

189
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,430
Kosugi-san?

190
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,530
There's something I'd like you to do for me.

191
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,850
What? You want us to audition?

192
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,970
It's an audition, but it's not that big a deal.

193
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,429
We were supposed to select some actors to appear in the movie

194
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,679
at yesterday's public announcement,

195
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,889
but two people dropped out after what happened with Yonekura-san's case.

196
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,610
So...

197
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,289
But we're not...

198
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,370
Yes, yes, yes! I'll do it!

199
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,120
Really?

200
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,379
I'd do anything to appear in a movie with Gomera and Yaiba!

201
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,960
Osaka Police HQ

202
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,250
I see.

203
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,380
I thought we could confirm before the meeting,

204
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,509
but Ishizawa won't talk.

205
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,890
He just keeps repeating that he doesn't know anything.

206
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,270
It's odd, though.

207
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,759
He's protecting the person who kept him locked up.

208
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,689
Come to think of it, I wonder what Mori-san is doing.

209
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,780
He said he'd return to his hotel after stopping by Ishizawa's house.

210
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,030
I hope he finds something.

211
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,830
Come in.

212
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,410
Hello.

213
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,920
Mori-san, we've been waiting for you.

214
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,179
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,559
I only meant to take a quick break at the hotel, but ended up oversleeping.

216
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,430
How was your visit to Ishizawa's house?

217
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,640
There's nothing to say.

218
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,810
Mori-san?

219
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,170
Nothing came of it...

220
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,820
Since I went right after forensics searched the place, I wasn't expecting much,

221
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,820
but I discovered something confusing about Ishizawa-san's actions.

222
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,839
What was confusing about his actions?

223
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:42,260
First, I'd like to know your opinion on the situation as an Osaka police investigator.

224
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,960
We're remaining silent,

225
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,340
but we believe Ishizawa Katsuji committed the bombings.

226
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:55,249
He plotted to murder Yonekura and the others to get revenge for the past.

227
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,279
Then who locked up Ishizawa?

228
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,720
We suspect he's putting on an act.

229
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,529
For what reason?

230
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,709
Didn't he want us to think there was another culprit?

231
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,630
The police were catching up to him.

232
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:15,159
But Ishizawa's name only came up yesterday.

233
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,559
Did he have time to set that up?

234
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,019
Well...

235
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,740
And concerning Onda-san's murder,

236
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,829
he had two cars which he drove on alternating days, correct?

237
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,750
Yes. On even days he drove the red one, and on odd days he drove the blue one.

238
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,849
But he died on an odd numbered day.

239
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,510
That's because the blue car happened to be having mechanical problems.

240
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,890
That coincidence was the first question I had.

241
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,859
If the culprit wanted to kill Onda-san as soon as possible,

242
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,780
he would have rigged both cars with explosives.

243
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:59,660
But the culprit deliberately chose the red car and installed a bomb in it.

244
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,910
In other words, the culprit wanted Onda-san to die in the red car

245
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,040
on an even day.

246
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,540
Next, there's Suemura-san's case.

247
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,579
The bomb was placed in the abandoned factory beforehand, right?

248
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:22,929
The bomb was placed inside a box and set to explode if it was opened.

249
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:28,299
How did the culprit know Suemura-san would be the one to open the box?

250
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,249
It happened at an abandoned factory.

251
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,440
No one else would come.

252
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,469
Then how did they know Suemura-san would go to an abandoned factory

253
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,570
that no one else would go to?

254
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,959
And why did the culprit do something as dangerous as leaving a bomb there beforehand?

255
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,080
So they'd have an alibi.

256
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:53,330
They'd be far away by the time the bomb exploded.

257
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,840
That's it.

258
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,009
That's why it was just the red car.

259
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:04,370
They wanted an alibi for when Onda-san's car exploded.

260
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,910
Onda-san was supposed to die a day later,

261
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,100
on the day of the movie's production announcement.

262
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,169
Of the people involved,

263
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,860
there was one man who'd have an alibi for that day and the day Suemura-san died,

264
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:25,280
as well as the authority to make Suemura-san go to the warehouse.

265
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,660
It was Yonekura.

266
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,209
But there was a bomb in Yonekura's car, too.

267
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,920
About that bomb...

268
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,949
Neither a timer nor a detonator has been found.

269
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,670
In other words,

270
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,519
It was an explosive, but it wasn't a bomb. Not yet, at least.

271
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,430
Not yet?

272
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,379
Yonekura-san probably intended to go rig the explosive as a bomb

273
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,369
on his way to the airport for his business trip,

274
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,310
after the production announcement.

275
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,559
Go rig the bomb? Where?

276
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,570
I see. So that's why he locked Ishizawa inside his house.

277
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:09,849
He probably intended to blow up Ishizawa and his house

278
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,580
with the bomb, and frame him for everything.

279
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:18,269
So it'd be treated as an accidental explosion caused by the bomber himself.

280
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,650
But it's possible...

281
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,379
Yonekura intended to leave a bomb in his car,

282
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,860
and then blow it up in the airport parking lot.

283
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,900
And he'd escape misfortune because he happened to be on a business trip.

284
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,070
Do you recall their testimony?

285
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:44,900
Yonekura-san kept muttering Onda's name while staring at the screen of his phone.

286
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,769
I see.

287
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,939
He was so distressed that Onda had died a day early

288
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,910
that he couldn't get out of the way of the falling kaiju.

289
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,540
But what was his motive?

290
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:05,050
This is where the strange actions taken by Ishizawa-san come in.

291
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,560
Ishizawa-san kicked open the door and escaped his prison,

292
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,350
but he slipped on the stairs and fell.

293
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:20,010
But the front door was just across from the stairs he fell down.

294
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:25,109
Why did Ishizawa-san go into the kitchen where he was discovered

295
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,310
instead of leaving through the front door and seeking help?

296
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,540
The answer was in a newspaper in the entryway.

297
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,430
It had been delivered while Ishizawa-san was locked up.

298
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,170
An article on Yonekura-san's murder was all over the front page.

299
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,670
Ishizawa-san had a thought.

300
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,349
If he sought help from the police, he'd be questioned about Yonekura-san's bombing,

301
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,879
and his past deeds could be exposed.

302
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,310
His past deeds?

303
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,690
Ten years ago, four men stole 120 million yen in Kobe.

304
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,950
I-Impossible. They're the suspects in that case?

305
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:15,239
My investigation revealed that Yonekura-san, Onda-san,

306
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,529
and Suemura-san all paid off large debts ten years ago.

307
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,330
What?

308
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,309
Not only that, but recently Onda-san had a failed investment,

309
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,720
and he was in debt once again.

310
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,909
So Yonekura planned to kill everyone involved

311
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,029
because Onda was blackmailing him?

312
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,730
But there's nothing we can do without proof.

313
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,740
The proof should be arriving shortly.

314
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,389
I finally found it.

315
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,910
It was hard to find since the mansion was so huge.

316
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,160
What are you doing? We're in a meeting!

317
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,540
I was just doing as Kud—

318
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,830
As Mori-han asked and looking for evidence in Onda's house.

319
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,960
Kumori-han?

320
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:11,550
There should be concrete evidence on this disc right here.

321
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,510
Team Yonekura

322
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,709
Hey, Takashi! Are you listening?

323
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:44,439
I'm listening. Right, Katsuji?

324
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,230
Yone won't shut up.

325
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,859
The one they called Takashi is Onda, and the man next to him is Ishizawa.

326
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,240
And the other man is Yonekura.

327
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,759
Then Ryohei-san will...

328
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,230
Hey! What are you filming for, you idiot?!

329
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,680
Ryohei must be Suemura.

330
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:08,850
If we copy this video and distribute it to everyone, no one can betray us.

331
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,769
We should contact the Hyogo police immediately.

332
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,610
Wait!

333
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,529
This is bad news.

334
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,260
What's bad?

335
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,180
Look at the screen.

336
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,009
There are four men in the shot, right?

337
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,069
Yeah.

338
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,810
What about it?

339
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,310
Then who's shooting the video?

340
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,599
So there were five robbers.

341
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,320
Yeah.

342
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,700
Which means in the presence of the final man...

343
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,450
It's already been set.

344
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,740
A bomb that could go off at any time.

345
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,709
Seems like Ishizawa didn't talk.

346
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,590
Which means it's our turn at bat.

347
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,710
Yeah.

348
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,720
We've learned that what we thought was a team of four robbers was actually a team of five.

349
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,720
Find him!

350
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,100
It's time for our final participant.

351
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,100
Entry number 5, from right here in Osaka.

352
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,950
Toyama Kazuha-san.

353
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:15,110
The next episode of Conan is "Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba, Finale!"
