1
00:00:01,063 --> 00:00:02,862
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,863 --> 00:00:04,662
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,663 --> 00:00:06,262
The abduction case is more than what it seems.

4
00:00:06,263 --> 00:00:08,262
But as we look into the mysteries, their motive becomes clear.

5
00:00:08,263 --> 00:00:09,862
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,863 --> 00:00:11,762
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:13,763
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,709 --> 00:02:00,409
We went to participate in a tennis tournament at Kunamoto.

9
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:06,908
After finding a cell phone that someone had dropped,

10
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:09,209
Ran and Sanoko went to deliver it back to the owner.

11
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:13,509
But there, Ran unable to defend herself...

12
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:17,209
and was kidnapped by someone.

13
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:28,709
"Smash of Love and Resolve (Part 2)"

14
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:33,508
We've kidnapped a high school girl called Ran Mouri.

15
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:37,008
If you want her back safely, get 50 million yen ready.

16
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:39,108
Take that money

17
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:42,108
and get on the Amakusa Pearl Line Cruiser departing at 3:00 pm.

18
00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:45,109
We'll contact you again from there.

19
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:49,408
Darn.

20
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:51,808
Fifty million yen is totally impossible.

21
00:02:51,809 --> 00:02:56,008
Moreover, it's only 2 hours till 3:00 pm.

22
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,708
Mr. Mouri.

23
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,808
Mr. Mouri, about that...

24
00:02:59,809 --> 00:03:04,908
After hearing your name, a local big shot has offered to help.

25
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:06,808
I want to thank you for that.

26
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:11,508
Then, let me take the money.

27
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:13,208
No, that's not...

28
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:15,408
Please. Let me take it.

29
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:19,309
I can't just sit here and do nothing, I can't take it.

30
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:21,708
All right.

31
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:25,008
But, you've got to give me your word that you won't do anything rash,

32
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:27,408
and that you'll follow our orders.

33
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:29,609
Okay. I owe you one.

34
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:38,809
"Kumamoto Prefectural Police Department."

35
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:46,309
You don't seem to like the idea.

36
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:48,608
Ai.

37
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:52,008
You're thinking that it's not just a plain kidnapping case, right?

38
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:53,508
Right.

39
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:58,508
Why'd the kidnapper call the police department directly?

40
00:03:58,509 --> 00:03:59,908
It's strange because normally no criminal

41
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:03,208
would want to get in touch with the police

42
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,208
if at all possible.

43
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:07,508
Besides, there's two hours to go

44
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:08,608
before the money is to be handed over.

45
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:11,808
It's as if they're giving the police to get their men together.

46
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:12,908
Right.

47
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:14,309
And, there's one more thing...

48
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:18,508
The last words Ran mentioned over the phone.

49
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,909
They were saying that they're going to kill somebody today...

50
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:24,909
Which means...

51
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,608
That the kidnapping is just a sham,

52
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:29,908
and there's a possibility that they kidnapped Ran

53
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:32,608
so that their murder plan wouldn't be revealed.

54
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:35,608
Which means that even if the ransom is paid,

55
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,008
that won't guarantee that they'll let her go.

56
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:39,708
Yeah.

57
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:42,008
However, although it would've been really simple

58
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,908
to shut Ran up on the spot,

59
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,408
they went out of their way to kidnap her.

60
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:49,509
So, they just may let her free.

61
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:52,108
I guess so.

62
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:56,608
First priority is to figure out where Ran is being confined.

63
00:04:56,609 --> 00:04:58,708
Once that's done, everything will co me to light.

64
00:04:58,709 --> 00:04:59,709
Right.

65
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:04,408
Bad news.

66
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:06,308
Conan is nowhere in sight.

67
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:09,108
-What? -Come to think of it, neither is Ai.

68
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,908
Ai too?

69
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:15,608
Really, and the semi-finals is going to be starting soon.

70
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:17,308
Maybe...

71
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:20,209
Maybe they both went to look for Ran.

72
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:26,308
No good, there're no clues to the kidnappers left.

73
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:28,408
Nobody seems to have heard of a place called Hirukomachi either.

74
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:29,808
Darn.

75
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:34,208
I searched the internet and hit several sites, though?

76
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,208
But they are all far and most likely not what we're looking for.

77
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:42,808
Yeah. It took them an hour to call after kidnapping Ran.

78
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,808
If they're traveling by car,

79
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:46,908
they are within a radius of 40 km.

80
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:50,008
If there is no place call Hirukomachi within that distance,

81
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:53,408
she probably read it wrong, or it's somebody's name.

82
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:56,408
Will you look for the name of a town that is within this distance?

83
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:59,909
I'll go check out all the names in the phone book.

84
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,909
Hiru, Hiru...

85
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,208
Hey. You guys.

86
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:09,908
We looked all over for you.

87
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:11,808
Hey, what about the match, you guys?

88
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:15,608
How rude. We're worried about Ran too.

89
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,008
Don't take us lightly.

90
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,509
Sonoko was crying at the hotel too.

91
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:23,509
That's it.

92
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:29,508
Ran, Ran...

93
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:31,508
Answer the phone. Please.

94
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:34,509
Come on, you're a detective's daughter, aren't you?

95
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:36,908
Ran?

96
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,608
It's you, Conan.

97
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:42,808
Sonoko, about that cell phone that you picked up...

98
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:45,109
Is there anything else you noticed about it besides the mail?

99
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:48,208
Come to think of it...

100
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,408
Just before we reached the coffee shop were supposed to meet,

101
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,108
a mail came in.

102
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:54,609
Come on, why didn't you mention that earlier?

103
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:57,908
What was it about?

104
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:00,509
Well... It was kind of strange.

105
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:03,908
Sonoko, if you can't make it today,

106
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:08,308
please go offer incense by yourself on the memorial day of his death.

107
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:09,908
And don't forget to take the sunflower

108
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:11,508
that is growing behind the factory in Yokomachi.

109
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:12,909
That's what the content said.

110
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,208
On the other side of the sunflowers,

111
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:19,209
there is a sign.

112
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:25,909
It's Yokomachi.

113
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:31,308
Yokomachi, Yokomachi...

114
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:33,708
Here it is. It's written "Hirunoko"

115
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:35,408
but read Yokomachi Clinic.

116
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:37,008
I found it.

117
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:39,408
Conan, what's up?

118
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:41,408
Hey, are you listening?

119
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:44,308
Hey, how dare you hang up like that on me?

120
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:45,609
Come to think of it...

121
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:49,109
"The sunflower..." -The sunflowers that Ran saw...

122
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:52,908
Oh no.

123
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,608
"Cruise ship docks."

124
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:56,808
"Cruise ship docks and sourvenir shop."

125
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,809
"Cruise ship ticket booth."

126
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:02,009
Hold on a just a while longer, Ran.

127
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:07,509
"Akira Doi (25), Factory Worker."

128
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:11,708
Now, the semi-finals are finally about to begin.

129
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,708
Who is going to win the first match?

130
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,308
Will it be Masato Tachikawa?

131
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:18,109
Or will it be the new star of hope, Kyohei Umabuchi?

132
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:25,008
Both contestants are exchanging a firm hand shake now.

133
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,608
Masato Tachikawa is his usually composed self.

134
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:31,108
On the contrary, his opponent, Kyohei Umabuchi is full of fighting spirit.

135
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:33,208
As would be most fitting for the first match,

136
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:36,109
the finals start off with both contestants who belong to this locale.

137
00:08:38,109 --> 00:08:39,308
Don't move.

138
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,208
"Hideki Mamiya (25), Factory Worker" -You'd better stay still or,

139
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:42,309
you see this.

140
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,708
"Yokomachi."

141
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,408
Thanks for the lift.

142
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:50,209
Yeah, take care.

143
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:56,608
There it is, the sunflower field.

144
00:08:56,609 --> 00:09:00,209
Okay. Here goes the Youth Detective Squad.

145
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:07,009
Win. You've got to win.

146
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:27,909
The Youth Detective Squad is here.

147
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:31,308
Are you all right, Ran?

148
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,308
Thank you, Conan.

149
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:34,508
I'm glad.

150
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:36,108
It's good to know you're okay.

151
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,508
Sorry to keep you waiting.

152
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:39,408
Thank you everybody.

153
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:40,808
Right. We've got big trouble.

154
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:42,908
These men were saying,

155
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:45,008
"Today's the only chance to kill that guy."

156
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:47,308
We've got to get the police right away.

157
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:49,309
Today's the only chance?

158
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:00,708
What?

159
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:03,709
Hideki, how could you? You let her get you?

160
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:07,308
Darn.

161
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:08,408
It's hurt.

162
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,108
Get a taste of your own medicine.

163
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,208
Okay. Leave the rest to us.

164
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:14,209
Stay still.

165
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:17,609
Case closed.

166
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:25,508
Yes.

167
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:27,808
What? Really?

168
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:29,809
All right, we'll be right there.

169
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:32,409
Mr. Mouri.

170
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,209
You don't have to board the cruiser anymore.

171
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:40,108
What's taking the police so long?

172
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:42,108
You're right.

173
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:45,609
By the way, who were you guys thinking of killing?

174
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:50,108
If you don't want to tell me, I'll tell you.

175
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,808
If today's the only chance you have to kill him,

176
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:56,308
it must be somebody who is involved in today's tournament.

177
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:58,409
You were watching the TV broadcast too, besides.

178
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:03,008
When I checked out this map, I didn't notice anything but,

179
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:05,609
the person who gave us a lift was saying...

180
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:09,808
that this iron factory is the possession of Kenzo Narimasu,

181
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:12,709
the host of the tennis tournament.

182
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:19,808
I'll bet you were asked to kill somebody by Mr. Narimasu, right?

183
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:22,208
Why should we team up with a guy like that?

184
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:24,608
Stupid. Don't talk.

185
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:29,109
Which means you were planning to kill Mr. Narimasu after all, right?

186
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,308
What's the matter?

187
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:36,908
The place that they hit me when they kidnapped me

188
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,108
is starting to hurt.

189
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:39,909
Hey, are you all right?

190
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:45,208
Conan, there's another criminal. The one who hit me.

191
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:46,408
What?

192
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:49,008
You mean the one they call Sonoko?

193
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:52,008
No, I think it was a man.

194
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:55,509
When I passed out, I heard the voice of another man.

195
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:59,108
Maybe that man is still...

196
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:02,309
He is after Mr. Narimasu's life.

197
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,945
What?

198
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:15,945
Cancel the tennis match and protect Mr. Narimasu?

199
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:18,345
Yes, because besides the men who are here,

200
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:19,945
there is one more of them,

201
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:22,645
and that man is after Mr. Narimasu's life.

202
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:24,245
Wait a minute.

203
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:29,245
So, what you're saying is this was not a kidnap for ransom?

204
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:32,845
No. But, there's no time now to go into detail.

205
00:12:32,846 --> 00:12:36,345
You've got to hurry or Mr. Narimasu's life is in danger.

206
00:12:36,346 --> 00:12:40,645
Okay. You're going to have to give me the details later, though.

207
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:41,945
Officer Tamana.

208
00:12:41,946 --> 00:12:44,346
Okay, I'll see to it that they do so immediately.

209
00:12:48,246 --> 00:12:49,746
You have got to be kidding.

210
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:54,145
"Kenzo Narimasu (60)" -My political life rests on this tournament.

211
00:12:54,146 --> 00:12:55,945
"Congressman" -I'm not going to let the police interfere this tournament

212
00:12:55,946 --> 00:12:57,445
just for their own convenience.

213
00:12:57,446 --> 00:12:59,545
But, your life is being endangered...

214
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:00,845
Shut up.

215
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:04,745
That's why I hire them and pay them a lot of money to protect me.

216
00:13:04,746 --> 00:13:06,545
I'm not canceling the tournament.

217
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:08,546
We're continuing the match as is.

218
00:13:11,646 --> 00:13:15,645
Strange, they're not canceling the match.

219
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:17,245
I wonder what's going on?

220
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:18,646
Hey, Conan.

221
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:21,346
Mr. Narimasu.

222
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:25,045
What a match.

223
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:27,845
Do you have any comments as host of this tournament?

224
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:29,345
Well, I guess this is above all riches and fame,

225
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:31,045
I couldn't ask for more as a host.

226
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:35,045
It seems that my life is being sought after,

227
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:38,545
however I, Narimasu will not be intimidated by such threats.

228
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:40,545
What?

229
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:45,245
I am firmly determined to throw my life out

230
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:49,145
for the local citizens of Kumamoto.

231
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:50,446
No.

232
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:54,012
So, who will be going to the award stand

233
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:55,412
to receive the honorable championship trophy

234
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:58,312
from the chairman of this tournament Kenzo Narimasu?

235
00:13:58,313 --> 00:14:00,212
Will it be Masato Tachikawa?

236
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:02,313
Or will it be Kyohei Umabuchi?

237
00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:05,413
What shall we do, Conan?

238
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:12,013
Too bad. Your efforts have gone down the drain.

239
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:15,212
I'll tell you something good.

240
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:19,512
That guy, Narimasu doesn't give a darn about people coming after his life,

241
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:24,012
because he's spending a lot of money to keep himself protected.

242
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:26,012
Right.

243
00:14:26,013 --> 00:14:27,912
If they're only after his life,

244
00:14:27,913 --> 00:14:30,512
it doesn't have to be today.

245
00:14:30,513 --> 00:14:34,512
Because even today, he is in fact, being protected by his bodyguards.

246
00:14:34,513 --> 00:14:36,112
But, according to Ran, they were saying

247
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:38,713
that today's the only chance they have of carrying out the murder.

248
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:43,512
Why? Why is it today?

249
00:14:43,513 --> 00:14:45,512
Sonoko.

250
00:14:45,513 --> 00:14:48,313
Maybe the one called Sonoko can stop them?

251
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:54,213
Because wasn't Sonoko against this idea?

252
00:14:55,513 --> 00:14:58,212
Didn't you two actually want Sonoko to stop you

253
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:00,412
from going through with this?

254
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:02,812
Isn't that why you sent her that mail?

255
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:06,212
Shut up. We're avenging his death.

256
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:09,512
Besides, Sonoko's the one who was most maltreated

257
00:15:09,513 --> 00:15:12,112
by Narimasu among all of us.

258
00:15:12,113 --> 00:15:15,112
That's why this is also for Sonoko's sake too.

259
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:19,712
But, wasn't already trying to forget everything already?

260
00:15:19,713 --> 00:15:22,513
Maybe that's why she was against this plan?

261
00:15:24,413 --> 00:15:25,413
Hey.

262
00:15:25,414 --> 00:15:27,112
Isn't he Mr. Narimasu's secretary,

263
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:31,513
Mr. Saiki, who committed suicide the other day?

264
00:15:33,113 --> 00:15:35,812
So, that's the story after all.

265
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:38,312
Today is Mr. Saiki's memorial day, isn't it?

266
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,812
You all used to visit his grave together, right?

267
00:15:41,813 --> 00:15:44,712
I think Sonoko is waiting for you at the grave.

268
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:46,312
I'm sure she's waiting for you both to come.

269
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,012
She believes that you'll drop this plan

270
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,912
and come to his grave,

271
00:15:49,913 --> 00:15:51,613
where she's waiting.

272
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:55,412
It's too late.

273
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:59,512
Maybe Sonoko could've stopped this plan.

274
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:01,912
But, no more, not from now.

275
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:03,312
Hey, Hideki.

276
00:16:03,313 --> 00:16:05,612
The match has already gone this far.

277
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:07,012
You idiot.

278
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:08,013
What?

279
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:09,312
That's it folks, this is the last game,

280
00:16:09,313 --> 00:16:10,812
whether you like it or not.

281
00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:13,413
Tachikawa serves the ball.

282
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:18,112
I see. I got it.

283
00:16:18,113 --> 00:16:20,613
Now I know why it's got to be carried out today.

284
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,212
So, who will be the one going up to the award stand

285
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:25,612
to receive the honorable championship trophy

286
00:16:25,613 --> 00:16:28,913
from the chairman of this tournament Kenzo Narimasu?

287
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:33,712
The bodyguards are going to be some distance away

288
00:16:33,713 --> 00:16:35,812
for just an instant during this match.

289
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:37,712
But, which of them is it?

290
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:40,312
Which of them is the killer?

291
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:42,512
They're both from this locale.

292
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:44,412
They're ages are more or less the same.

293
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:45,712
Which of them is it?

294
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,612
Which of them on earth is it?

295
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:48,813
Darn.

296
00:16:52,313 --> 00:16:53,313
What is it?

297
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:57,613
This is...

298
00:17:00,113 --> 00:17:02,312
I found him.

299
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,313
The killer is him.

300
00:17:07,713 --> 00:17:08,912
It's a chopper.

301
00:17:08,913 --> 00:17:11,012
I'm sure it's the police.

302
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:12,212
Ran!

303
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:14,013
Hey, Ran!

304
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:17,113
Are you okay, Ran?

305
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,912
I'm fine. I'm okay.

306
00:17:20,913 --> 00:17:22,612
I'm sorry, Ran!

307
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:24,312
I'll bet you were scared.

308
00:17:24,313 --> 00:17:25,613
Sonoko!

309
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:31,912
I can understand why you want to kill Mr. Narimasu,

310
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:35,012
but I'm still not convinced.

311
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:39,412
A brat like you would never understand how we feel.

312
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:42,412
Yeah, I don't even want to know how it feels.

313
00:17:42,413 --> 00:17:43,912
Who cares about how somebody feels

314
00:17:43,913 --> 00:17:46,012
about wanting to kill somebody else?

315
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:49,212
Darn, who the heck are you anyway?

316
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:53,013
I'm Conan Edogawa, a detective.

317
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,012
Officer. Please head for the tennis tournament grounds immediately.

318
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:07,412
I've figured out who the other criminal is.

319
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:08,812
What?

320
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:10,713
We've got to hurry, or we won't make it in time.

321
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:15,913
We will now award the winner with the championship trophy.

322
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:21,012
Winner, Mr. Masato Tachikawa.

323
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:23,112
You have achieved outstanding performance

324
00:18:23,113 --> 00:18:29,912
at the memorable First Land of Fire Cup Charity Tennis Tournament

325
00:18:29,913 --> 00:18:33,912
and will be awarded the Championship Cup.

326
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:37,113
Mr. Tachikawa, please step up to the award stand.

327
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:47,413
Congratulations.

328
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:56,212
It's been a long time, Mr. Narimasu.

329
00:18:56,213 --> 00:18:59,012
I wonder where I have seen you before?

330
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,512
I'm Tachikawa, who was working under Mr. Saiki

331
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:05,812
at your factory 10 years ago.

332
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:09,813
10 years ago under Saiki...

333
00:19:10,813 --> 00:19:13,613
Don't tell me that you're...

334
00:19:16,313 --> 00:19:18,512
So, you finally remember.

335
00:19:18,513 --> 00:19:22,712
I'm Masato Tachikawa, who was slave driven at your factory

336
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:24,513
without being paid decently either.

337
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:28,713
Don't move.

338
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:34,512
I was worried when I heard that Mr. Saiki became your secretary

339
00:19:34,513 --> 00:19:36,512
when you became a congressman.

340
00:19:36,513 --> 00:19:38,912
I'll bet you pushed all your wrongdoings onto Mr. Saiki

341
00:19:38,913 --> 00:19:40,212
and killed him, right?

342
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,412
No. Saiki committed suicide.

343
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:44,413
You made him commit suicide, didn't you?

344
00:19:46,513 --> 00:19:50,312
Darn, how dare you kill such a good person...

345
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:54,312
10 years ago, when we fled from your factory,

346
00:19:54,313 --> 00:19:57,612
Mr. Saiki's the one who stopped us from taking revenge on you.

347
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,612
But, we should've killed you back then.

348
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:04,312
If we did, Mr. Saiki wouldn't have had to die.

349
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:06,812
Don't... please don't.

350
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:09,313
Go to the world beyond and apologize to Mr. Saiki!

351
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,812
Masato Tachikawa.

352
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:18,012
Throw down your weapon and let the hostage go.

353
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:20,212
Shut up, if you come any closer...

354
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:21,913
Masato, please don't.

355
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:28,413
It's me, Sonoko.

356
00:20:29,613 --> 00:20:31,212
Sonoko.

357
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:33,312
Let's stop all this already, Masato.

358
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:35,712
Today's Mr. Saiki's memorial day.

359
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:40,812
He'll be lonely if we don't go visit his grave all together.

360
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:45,212
Okay? Let's all go together, please.

361
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:46,513
Sonoko.

362
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,412
No. Please.

363
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:53,312
The tennis that Mr. Saiki approved of,

364
00:20:53,313 --> 00:20:56,212
your tennis is going to get all messed up.

365
00:20:56,213 --> 00:21:01,012
Mr. Saiki was really happy when you became a pro tennis player, remember?

366
00:21:01,013 --> 00:21:05,413
Please don't do anything to make him sad.

367
00:21:14,113 --> 00:21:15,413
Masato.

368
00:21:27,313 --> 00:21:28,612
"Congressman Narimasu Arrested."

369
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:29,712
Three days later,

370
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:33,512
congressman Narimasu was arrested on charges of bribery.

371
00:21:33,513 --> 00:21:35,512
It also said in the papers that further investigation

372
00:21:35,513 --> 00:21:37,012
will be conducted as to the truth

373
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:38,812
behind his secretary Saiki's suicide.

374
00:21:38,813 --> 00:21:40,913
"Congressman Narimasu's True Intentions."

375
00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:09,412
All seems to have ended well.

376
00:23:09,413 --> 00:23:10,712
However, Ai and I have to take responsibility

377
00:23:10,713 --> 00:23:14,112
for losing our chance to win the finals...

378
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:17,412
No, the semi-finals, that is.

379
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:19,112
Oh boy.

380
00:23:19,113 --> 00:23:21,212
Conan, shape up.

381
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:22,512
Break a leg!

382
00:23:22,513 --> 00:23:25,513
You've got three more laps to go.

383
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:34,013
I'll keep you company.

384
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:39,012
I guess I'll go take a run too.

385
00:23:39,013 --> 00:23:40,013
Hey.

386
00:23:41,613 --> 00:23:44,212
Good morning, Ai.

387
00:23:44,213 --> 00:23:46,213
Shall we go run too?

388
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:49,713
Wait for me.

389
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,512
Let's go.

390
00:23:53,513 --> 00:23:55,113
Oh, brother.

391
00:23:57,713 --> 00:24:02,712
"Next Episode."

392
00:24:02,713 --> 00:24:04,312
Amazing.

393
00:24:04,313 --> 00:24:06,012
It's so pretty.

394
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:08,013
Tamaya!

395
00:24:12,713 --> 00:24:13,812
Mr. Kawai?

396
00:24:13,813 --> 00:24:17,112
Mr. Kawai, please get a hold of yourself!

397
00:24:17,113 --> 00:24:18,313
Mr. Kawai!

398
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:21,213
This is...

399
00:24:22,203 --> 00:24:23,712
Next Conan,

400
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:27,713
"Houseboat Fishing Shock."
