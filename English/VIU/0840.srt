1
00:00:02,094 --> 00:00:03,994
Good morning, Dad.

2
00:00:03,994 --> 00:00:06,494
We already started eating because you didn't get up.

3
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:08,794
They seem to have arrested the perp for the murder

4
00:00:08,794 --> 00:00:10,994
the day before yesterday.

5
00:00:10,994 --> 00:00:12,794
The day before yesterday?

6
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:15,194
You mean the one at Tonkoro City?

7
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:18,594
This woman...

8
00:00:19,694 --> 00:00:23,594
The suspect is currently being held at Tonkoro Police Station,

9
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:25,494
where she is being questioned.

10
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,994
A canvas stained black with crime.

11
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:31,494
Vivid brilliant deduction skills changes its color!

12
00:00:31,494 --> 00:00:33,694
A beautiful perp that came on TV,

13
00:00:33,694 --> 00:00:35,794
Pops acts unexpectedly.

14
00:00:35,794 --> 00:00:37,494
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:39,594
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult

16
00:00:39,594 --> 00:00:42,094
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:26,889
"The Last Gift"

18
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:29,589
What is it, Mr. Mouri?

19
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:31,889
The important thing you wanted to talk to me about?

20
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:36,689
First, could you tell me the details of case?

21
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:41,689
It started yesterday on Saturday morning.

22
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:43,889
The body of Masaru Katsui,

23
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:46,389
who was thought to be murdered the night before

24
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:49,489
was discovered in the back of a park in Tonkoro City.

25
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:54,489
Because he was a serial blackmailer,

26
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:58,189
we believed that the suspect was one of his victims.

27
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:02,189
As we were questioning the suspects that we had on our list...

28
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:03,589
"Junko Hirose (25)"

29
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:06,889
Last night, Katsui came.

30
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:09,389
He demanded money from me again.

31
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,889
I just couldn't take it anymore.

32
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:15,389
Since she had a motive and she herself confessed,

33
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:17,089
we arrested her.

34
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:20,689
And, there's no mistake that this man Katsui was murdered

35
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:24,589
on Friday night around 8:00?

36
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:27,889
His wristwatch was stopped at that time.

37
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:31,789
We believed it broke when he was killed.

38
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:34,889
Besides, at around 7:20pm,

39
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:39,789
the security camera caught him arriving at Tonkoro City Station.

40
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:43,789
If he met the killer after that and was killed then...

41
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:47,189
If this wristwatch was stopped was stopped at 8pm

42
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:50,089
and that equals the time of the murder,

43
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:53,689
then she is not the killer after all.

44
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:55,689
What?

45
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:57,589
That night around 8:00,

46
00:03:57,589 --> 00:04:00,589
she was at Beika City.

47
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:03,389
It's still 8pm?

48
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:05,489
Thank God it's Friday!

49
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:07,389
One more shop!

50
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,189
Beautiful lady?

51
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:25,589
Are you all right?

52
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:33,389
Miss?

53
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:39,489
That's why she couldn't have committed the crime.

54
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:42,189
From Beika City to the scene of the crime,

55
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:45,489
it would take close to an hour even by car.

56
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:46,589
Inspector.

57
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:48,989
What?

58
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,989
You want me to roll up my pants?

59
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:53,789
Just for our reference.

60
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:54,989
The left side.

61
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:06,089
So, it was you after all.

62
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:10,089
I happened to see you

63
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:13,189
on Friday night at 8:00 in Beika City.

64
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:18,889
Could you explain, Ms. Hirose?

65
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,389
You're right.

66
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:29,589
There's a restaurant that I know in Beika City,

67
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:31,389
so I was planning to go there.

68
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:35,089
But my leg hurt, so I ended up not going.

69
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:39,689
Rather, why did you lie and say you killed Katsui?

70
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:40,889
Well...

71
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:46,489
I figured that the killer would be somebody like me.

72
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:48,089
If that person was being blackmailed by Katsui,

73
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:51,089
I didn't mind being the killer.

74
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:56,589
At any rate, your alibi's been established.

75
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:00,589
But false testimony is an interference of public duties.

76
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:03,889
We'll let it go this time.

77
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:08,089
We're also at fault for rushing to make an arrest.

78
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:09,489
I'm happy for you.

79
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:11,389
Thank you very much.

80
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:12,789
No problem.

81
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:20,789
So, she was acquitted and safely released.

82
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,489
Thanks to me, her savior!

83
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:27,889
But something's strange about that lady called Ms. Junko Hirose.

84
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,889
To turn herself in for a murder she didn't even commit.

85
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:32,889
What?

86
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:36,289
She has a motive, right?

87
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:39,289
But she has a witness to her alibi.

88
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:44,789
Maybe the actual time of the crime's not correct.

89
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:50,789
Maybe the killer adjusted the time on his watch after killing him.

90
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:53,889
Ms. Junko Hirose confessed that she committed the crime.

91
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,089
Since she confessed to the crime,

92
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:58,389
she didn't need to change the time of committing the crime, did she?

93
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:00,589
Well, I guess so. But...

94
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:07,489
Wait, brat!

95
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:09,889
She's unmistakably innocent.

96
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:12,389
But doesn't something bother you about her?

97
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,089
I'll go check.

98
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,289
Maybe I can find out why Ms. Hirose

99
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:18,389
wanted to turn herself in as the killer.

100
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:23,989
Then, you should look into her connections with Beika City.

101
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:25,889
Because when I saw her,

102
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:27,789
she didn't appear to be going to a restaurant

103
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:30,289
to eat, drink, and have a good time.

104
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:34,589
I need to figure out what she really came to Beika City for.

105
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:35,589
I see.

106
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,989
Ms. Hirose was lying.

107
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:40,789
Just because she lied I don't think she's guilty.

108
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:43,989
I see.

109
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:47,389
You want to prove that Conan is wrong.

110
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:51,189
And in order to do so, I think it's best to find the real killer.

111
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:52,489
Over here.

112
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:54,689
This is where Masaru Katsui's body was found.

113
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:55,989
Here?

114
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:57,989
But this place is...

115
00:07:57,989 --> 00:08:02,589
I'm surprised they found the body in such a well concealed place.

116
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:08,389
An anonymous woman called the police.

117
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:10,089
I see.

118
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:14,889
But I wonder why that woman came to a place like this?

119
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,989
How would I know?

120
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:20,389
The time he was killed was determined to be around 8:00 at night

121
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,589
because the victim's wristwatch was stopped at that time, right?

122
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:25,689
Yes.

123
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:30,889
We know that Katsui got to Tonkoro City Station at about 7:20pm.

124
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,489
That matches the time of death determined by the autopsy.

125
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:38,789
Which was between 7pm and 9pm.

126
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,989
Between 7pm and 9pm?

127
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:46,989
If she hurried back to Tonkoro City

128
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:49,689
after being seen at Beika City at 8pm,

129
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:51,289
she would've arrived around 9pm.

130
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:55,189
Ms. Hirose could've barely committed the crime, too.

131
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:59,189
Then, made it seem as though he'd been killed at 8pm.

132
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:02,989
Then, she would've created an alibi for that time beforehand, right?

133
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:07,189
Somebody other than who just coincidentally happened to see her!

134
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:08,189
But...

135
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:11,889
And? Do you have any evidence that could lead us to the real killer?

136
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:13,889
Nothing whatsoever.

137
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:17,689
Katsui bought two packs of cigarettes at the station,

138
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:22,089
but one was left untouched in his pocket.

139
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:24,489
So he was a heavy smoker.

140
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:27,289
Either way, there's no clue.

141
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:30,189
But if there's even a slight chance

142
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:31,789
that she could've committed the crime...

143
00:09:31,789 --> 00:09:33,989
Enough, brat!

144
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:39,289
Her man lives in Beika City?

145
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:42,689
It's her ex-boyfriend to be exact.

146
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:45,689
His name is Mr. Atsuro Matsubayashi.

147
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:47,889
And it seems he recently got engaged

148
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:50,289
to the daughter of an executive where he works.

149
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:54,789
So, Ms. Junko Hirose was dumped.

150
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:58,789
But she has no other connections with Beika City,

151
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:03,989
so I think she was actually visiting him the other night.

152
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,989
So, she did have somebody else

153
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:10,689
who could verify her alibi besides you, Pops.

154
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:12,689
At 8pm.

155
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:15,389
You're saying that's him?

156
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,389
What're you talking about?

157
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:19,089
Fabricating an alibi.

158
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:22,589
If you assumed she used her ex-boyfriend...

159
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,789
Then, wouldn't she have naturally

160
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:29,089
told the police about Mr. Matsubayashi when they suspected her?

161
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:30,989
Right.

162
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:32,589
True, but...

163
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:36,289
I got it.

164
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:39,289
I've figured out why Ms. Hirose wanted to turn herself in.

165
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:46,689
That night, Ms. Hirose visited Mr. Matsubayashi.

166
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:51,689
In order to get rid of old mementos still left there.

167
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:54,789
But she couldn't tell the police about it.

168
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:57,089
She couldn't tell the police?

169
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,589
Right. She couldn't tell them.

170
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:01,789
Why not?

171
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:04,089
If she did, the police would try persistently

172
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:07,389
to confirm story with Mr. Matsubayashi.

173
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:11,189
If they do, then Mr. Matsubayashi's fiance may find out

174
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:16,189
that he let his ex-girlfriend into his room, right?

175
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:20,089
Then his fiance might think that he was up to something and doubt him!

176
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:23,889
If worse comes to worse, she may call off the engagement.

177
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:28,289
More so, she's the daughter of an executive at his company.

178
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:31,889
Mr. Matsubayashi may end up not being able to stay at his company, too.

179
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:34,189
Ms. Hirose probably hid the truth

180
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:36,989
because she didn't want him to go through something like this.

181
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,389
Even if it meant being convicted of a crime she didn't commit,

182
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:43,389
because she wanted to protect Mr. Matsubayashi's happiness!

183
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:46,089
He dumped her for another woman, you know?

184
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:47,989
But she still wanted to do it.

185
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:52,289
Because Ms. Hirose still loves Mr. Matsubayashi.

186
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:55,389
She turned herself in as the killer

187
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:59,789
as her last gift to Mr. Matsubayashi.

188
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:02,389
But, Ran...

189
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,189
Interesting.

190
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:10,689
Your theory that she tried to use her ex to fabricate her alibi.

191
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:14,389
And Ran's theory that she still loves him.

192
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:17,589
If we meet this Matsubayashi guy,

193
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,189
we'll find out right away which of you is correct.

194
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:23,289
"Atsuro Matsubayashi (28)" -What?

195
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:25,689
You're asking me if Junko came here?

196
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:27,789
Yes, two nights ago.

197
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,389
Of course not.

198
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:31,189
Because we broke up.

199
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:32,889
But, Mr. Matsubayashi...

200
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:33,989
What a nuisance!

201
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:35,189
Don't ever come here again!

202
00:12:41,989 --> 00:12:46,989
Based on his reaction, it's obvious that Ms. Hirose went to visit him.

203
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:49,089
But being the kind of man he is,

204
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:51,889
both your theories aren't supported.

205
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:53,089
You're right.

206
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:54,989
It's hard to believe that he's the kind of guy you'd want to protect

207
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:58,589
to the point of being convicted for something you didn't do.

208
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:02,389
And I doubt that he would've agreed to verify Ms. Hirose's alibi

209
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:04,589
even if she asked him to.

210
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:08,989
In other words, she couldn't have used him to fabricate her alibi.

211
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:12,989
I guess I was wrong about suspecting Ms. Hirose.

212
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:15,789
So, you finally admit it!

213
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:25,589
Either way, he's a selfish gold digger.

214
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:32,189
Even so, Ms. Hirose still really loved and trusted him.

215
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:36,189
Wait a sec.

216
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:37,989
Maybe this case...

217
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:41,489
Pops.

218
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:44,189
When you went to verify her alibi for her,

219
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,589
how did Ms. Hirose react?

220
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:52,689
She was surprised and flustered.

221
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:54,289
She pondered.

222
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:56,189
And then, she looked happy.

223
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:57,589
So what?

224
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:00,989
I'm just confirming.

225
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:04,989
If so, there should be a trace of it.

226
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,490
Excuse me.

227
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,190
Is Ms. Hirose moving out?

228
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,590
Yes. Because of the awful things she went through

229
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,790
like being suspected by the police.

230
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,790
Really?

231
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,090
That's rubbish, right?

232
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,890
I'll go throw it away for you.

233
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,890
Thanks, you're so thoughtful.

234
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,790
Since it was Friday night,

235
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,590
it probably hasn't been collected yet and should be here.

236
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,590
I found it.

237
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,290
What would you possibly want with me now?

238
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,990
Why did I have to be called out to a place like this?

239
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,690
Well, we don't have the slightest idea either.

240
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,690
Sorry to keep you waiting.

241
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,990
Why did you gather all of us here, Mr. Mouri?

242
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,190
What?

243
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,990
I was told to come here by you, Inspector.

244
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,690
Mr. Mouri, we examined this thing Conan brought us.

245
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,890
You were exactly right.

246
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,290
But what does this mean?

247
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,790
What's that?

248
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,390
I didn't...

249
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:38,290
You couldn't take it anymore, could you, Ms. Junko Hirose?

250
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,290
Yes?

251
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,890
I don't know what weak point he knew about you,

252
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,690
but Masaru Katsui kept blackmailing you.

253
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,390
And your boyfriend, Mr. Matsubayashi

254
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:51,790
went after an executive's daughter to marry her for money.

255
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,990
That's none of your business, is it?

256
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,990
And when Masaru Katsui demanded money from you again,

257
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,090
you wanted to get rid of this obnoxious blackmailer

258
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,690
from the face of this earth.

259
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,190
It's impossible to run after committing murder.

260
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,790
But you made up your mind.

261
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,090
If you could use the murder for another purpose,

262
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,390
you figured you didn't mind getting caught.

263
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,590
Then you carried it out.

264
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,490
But, Mr. Mouri...

265
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,190
You're the one who said she was innocent.

266
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,290
I thought you verified my alibi for me.

267
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,590
Just after 7:00 at night on the day of the incident,

268
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,790
you visited Mr. Matsubayashi who lives in Beika City.

269
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,190
What do you want?

270
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,090
You're getting married, aren't you?

271
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,790
Then, you've got to erase all traces of me.

272
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,190
Hey, wait.

273
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,290
You can't do that!

274
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,090
You entered Mr. Matsubayashi's room using some appropriated excuse.

275
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,790
Just about that time Masaru Katsui comes to Tonkoro City

276
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,390
because you told him to come.

277
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,290
And after leaving Mr. Matsubayashi's room at 8pm,

278
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,890
you rushed back to Tonkoro City.

279
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,590
And, I just happened to witness you then.

280
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:12,490
Then you led Masaru Katsui who was waiting for you to the crime scene

281
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,490
and killed him around 9pm.

282
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,090
You turned the hands of the wristwatch back to 8pm and broke it.

283
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,590
And the following morning,

284
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,690
you made an anonymous call to the police

285
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:26,390
and made them find Katsui's body.

286
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,790
You confessed your crime to the police detective that was asking around.

287
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,490
And everything was completed.

288
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,690
Last night, Katsui came.

289
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,290
He demanded money from me again.

290
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,990
I just couldn't take it anymore.

291
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,990
If the suspect is denying to have committed the crime,

292
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,690
there's a possibility that the wristwatch may have been rigged.

293
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,990
However, since you confessed to committing the crime,

294
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,890
nobody would doubt that.

295
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,190
You're right.

296
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,190
But if she meant to confess to the crime,

297
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,590
why did she fabricate such an alibi?

298
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,790
Mr. Matsubayashi.

299
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,490
You must've known that Ms. Hirose was arrested for murder

300
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,690
by seeing the news on TV, correct?

301
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,990
And that the time of the crime was 8pm on Friday night.

302
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,190
In other words,

303
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,990
even though you knew Ms. Hirose couldn't have done it,

304
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,190
you didn't come up front.

305
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,990
No. I was just about to...

306
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,090
That's a lie!

307
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,690
You're not the type to throw the good fortune

308
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,690
that you grasped down the drain, no matter what!

309
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,990
The other purpose for the killing of Katsui

310
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,490
was to make Mr. Matsubayashi feel guilty

311
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:46,990
for ignoring to save an innocent person from being accused.

312
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,090
This would've been Ms. Hirose's first crime

313
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,990
and if you think of her motive,

314
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,690
she would've been released in more or less a short period.

315
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,090
And after that...

316
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,390
How dare you ignore me, despite my being innocent?

317
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,190
How dare you watch and do nothing?

318
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,590
Dear, who is she?

319
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,990
What does she mean saying that you watched and did nothing?

320
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,090
You rigged the watch to make it look like the crime to place at 8pm,

321
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,690
so that Mr. Matsubayashi who selfishly dumped you, would feel guilty.

322
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,590
It was your last gift to him.

323
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,390
A gift filled with hatred.

324
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:40,690
You miscalculated when another person witnessed you.

325
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,290
That's why you were surprised.

326
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,690
And you were flustered and pondered.

327
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,190
You were considering how to handle my testimony.

328
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,390
Then, you happily latched onto it.

329
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,490
You weren't able to get rid of your grudge for Mr. Matsubayashi,

330
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,990
but you would be free of having committed murder.

331
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,290
They're all assumptions.

332
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,690
I haven't met Katsui for many years now.

333
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,290
That night at 7:20,

334
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,490
Katsui who arrives at Tonkoro City.

335
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,890
Just where was he for an hour and a half till 9pm when he was murdered?

336
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,790
Since you wanted to make everyone think that he was killed at 8pm,

337
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,790
you couldn't afford to have anyone witness Katsui.

338
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,290
The safest hiding place would be

339
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,690
your room.

340
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,290
She sure is late.

341
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,190
Officer Takagi, please explain.

342
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,790
In this convenience store shopping bag there are 10 cigarette butts

343
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,290
and a carton of 10 cigarettes that haven't been smoked yet.

344
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,990
Katsui's fingerprints were found on all the items.

345
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,790
And from this bag, Ms. Junko Hirose's fingerprints were also found.

346
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:06,390
In other words, Katsui was waiting for you in your room.

347
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:15,390
So he could be killed by me.

348
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,090
And I meant to use his murder

349
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:24,990
to take revenge for the betrayal of the man I loved and trusted.

350
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,890
You're absolutely correct.

351
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,590
Then Ms. Junko Hirose,

352
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,390
may I ask you to come with me to the station once again?

353
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,990
What a stupid lady.

354
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,090
I wonder if you can really laugh at her, Mr. Matsubayashi?

355
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,190
When the background of Ms. Hirose's crime is publicized in detail,

356
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,190
what will your fiance or her father think of you?

357
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,990
Suspect Junko Hirose who was arrested once again,

358
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,390
has obediently confessed to committing the crime.

359
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,890
You were right, Conan, after all.

360
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,790
It's just a coincidence.

361
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,990
That's right.

362
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,390
What went through his head just happened to be right.

363
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,390
It's like night and day from my deduction,

364
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,690
totally different like chalk and cheese!

365
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,990
Totally different.

366
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,290
Totally different.

367
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,890
-Totally different. -Give me a break, old man.

368
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:49,090
"Next Episode"

369
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,590
Are you hurt?

370
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,690
Tsutsumi?

371
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,590
Where did they find that suicide note?

372
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:04,690
It seems the paramedics found it in Mr. Tsutsumi's jacket pocket.

373
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:12,190
