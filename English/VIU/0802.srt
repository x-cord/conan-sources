1
00:00:00,586 --> 00:00:03,985
Ran, Pops and I who came to Tottori

2
00:00:03,986 --> 00:00:06,286
encounter a robbery case.

3
00:00:07,286 --> 00:00:10,785
The bride of a famed local family called Kumado is attacked,

4
00:00:10,786 --> 00:00:14,686
and the incense burner that is an heirloom, is stolen.

5
00:00:15,986 --> 00:00:17,085
The housekeeper of the family

6
00:00:17,086 --> 00:00:19,585
named Naomi Senda is at first suspected,

7
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:22,185
but she turns out to have an alibi and is found innocent.

8
00:00:22,186 --> 00:00:25,985
Pops deduces that someone among the family is the perp.

9
00:00:25,986 --> 00:00:29,686
However, for some reason, the stolen incense burner is returned.

10
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:34,085
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

11
00:00:34,086 --> 00:00:36,185
Love and cases come from the same origin.

12
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:38,285
A robbery with too many mysteries.

13
00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:40,685
Who is the culprit standing on the sand dunes?

14
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:42,285
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:42,286 --> 00:00:44,085
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,086
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:31,789
"Tottori Sand Dunes Mystery Tour (Tottori Edition)"

18
00:02:33,126 --> 00:02:36,326
The darn perp's given himself away.

19
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:40,025
The perp must've naturally assumed that the police would

20
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,125
keep a sharp eye out if something was actually stolen.

21
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:45,825
However, the perp was confident that the blackmail would succeed

22
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:47,525
so the incense burner was stolen.

23
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:51,025
But something that perp didn't expect happened.

24
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:55,925
The great and famed Detective, Kogoro Mouri made his appearance.

25
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,325
Huh?

26
00:02:57,326 --> 00:02:59,925
So, the perp gives in thinking he is no match for me.

27
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:04,325
Not wanting to be exposed of having the heirloom,

28
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:06,426
the perp hurriedly returns it!

29
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:10,325
And the only people who know of my involvement here

30
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:13,025
are the members of the Kumado family.

31
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,526
Therefore, the perp is among one of you here!

32
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:26,725
Scared of the detective and returned it, Sis?

33
00:03:26,726 --> 00:03:29,625
"Makie Kumado (35)" -I'll bet it was you?

34
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,325
Or was it you, Soichi?

35
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:32,425
"Soichi Kumado (32), oldest son."

36
00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:34,225
Like I said, it's not me.

37
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:36,125
"Iwao Kumado (68), head of the household" -Cut it out!

38
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:39,025
Well... Now that this has been returned,

39
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:41,525
who cares who the perp is.

40
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:44,725
Yes.

41
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:46,325
That won't do,

42
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,025
since this is a robbery, after all.

43
00:03:49,026 --> 00:03:52,725
I wonder why the robber returned the incense burner?

44
00:03:52,726 --> 00:03:55,625
What? Like I just said, the perp gave up.

45
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:58,425
The perp figured there'd be trouble, so quickly returned it.

46
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:00,825
Then all the perp had to do was

47
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:03,026
get rid of it instead of return it, right?

48
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:06,025
True, but...

49
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:08,026
It just goes to show that the perp has a conscience.

50
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:15,725
How will we determine which one of them, did it?

51
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:18,025
We'll go by your insider deduction

52
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:21,025
and do a thorough check on the alibis of the four.

53
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:25,026
After all, Ran and I could only get so far investigating.

54
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:27,325
The one without an alibi is the perp.

55
00:04:27,326 --> 00:04:30,025
It'll only be a matter of time.

56
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:33,525
I guess I'll leave that to Pops and the others.

57
00:04:33,526 --> 00:04:36,425
While I go check on the other person.

58
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:40,426
I wonder if there's anyone who knows a lot about Ms. Naomi Senda?

59
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:43,925
What?

60
00:04:43,926 --> 00:04:45,925
There's sure something fishy about her, too.

61
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:49,025
Who knows about Naomi's acquaintances and such.

62
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:52,225
I think her family's long gone, too.

63
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,525
I think she mentioned having an Uncle?

64
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:58,125
What? She did?

65
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:01,726
I think he worked as an employee at Pear Paradise.

66
00:05:04,226 --> 00:05:08,226
"Pear Paradise."

67
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:11,825
There's sure something fishy about Ms. Naomi Senda.

68
00:05:11,826 --> 00:05:14,525
Her alibi sounds so made up, too.

69
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:16,125
That too,

70
00:05:16,126 --> 00:05:20,525
but I wonder why she visited the Kumado's a day before the robbery?

71
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:23,025
To borrow money, right?

72
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:24,626
I think it's him.

73
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:33,125
This gigantic tree is the largest Asian pear tree in Japan.

74
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:34,126
After all...

75
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:37,025
"Kozo Adachi (55), Naomi's uncle" -We're okay on that.

76
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:39,525
You wanted to know about Naomi, right?

77
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:43,825
I've heard that she had quite a lot o debts.

78
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:46,125
See, that's why she went to borrow money.

79
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:49,125
But she couldn't have borrowed the money.

80
00:05:49,126 --> 00:05:50,525
Why should I lend her money?

81
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:52,725
That ungrateful swine stole money from this house

82
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,325
when she quit and took off.

83
00:05:54,326 --> 00:05:56,125
I see.

84
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:59,626
Unless she had some other means of getting what she needed.

85
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:04,426
Maybe she had a hold of someone's sore spot.

86
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,325
Hello?

87
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:12,626
Okay. I'll be right over.

88
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:15,125
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:17,825
Some urgent business seems to have come up.

90
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:20,426
Something comes to mind, right?

91
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:24,426
Really? Please tell us about it.

92
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:27,825
I scolded her not to gossip

93
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:31,525
about the family that she's working for.

94
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:33,725
She was rendezvousing with a man.

95
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,625
At the sand dunes, secretly.

96
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:37,125
She looks so virtuous,

97
00:06:37,126 --> 00:06:40,326
but who knows what goes on behind the scenes.

98
00:06:42,926 --> 00:06:46,225
It happened to years ago, just before she quit.

99
00:06:46,226 --> 00:06:47,425
That idiot!

100
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:49,526
She called this juicy information or what not's.

101
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:54,925
Juicy meaning a great content for blackmailing, right?

102
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:58,325
But I wonder if Shuko's the type to have an affair.

103
00:06:58,326 --> 00:07:00,625
The point is that she secretly went to see a man

104
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:03,525
and was witnessed doing so.

105
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:06,425
If Naomi threatened her saying she would tell,

106
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,925
Shuko would have no choice but to pay her to keep her quiet.

107
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:14,226
But I don't think Shuko has money that she can use freely.

108
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:17,425
I get the picture!

109
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:20,425
That's why Shuko was tied up back then!

110
00:07:20,426 --> 00:07:22,526
What? What do you mean?

111
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:29,025
All four had alibis?

112
00:07:29,026 --> 00:07:31,425
At around 1:00 when the incident occurred,

113
00:07:31,426 --> 00:07:35,725
the eye-witnesses testified seeing Iwao, head of the household,

114
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:37,925
the oldest daughter, Makie,

115
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:40,025
the oldest son, Soichi

116
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,125
and Junji as well.

117
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:44,726
So, all four of them are innocent?

118
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:51,625
The members in the family are the only ones with the key,

119
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:54,325
and the ones who could've picked up the pendant

120
00:07:54,326 --> 00:07:58,825
that Naomi Senda dropped the previous day...

121
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:02,025
Wait a sec. This robbery...

122
00:08:02,026 --> 00:08:03,726
Maybe...

123
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:08,625
Then, Dad, you too?

124
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:11,425
Yeah, it seems I've come to the same conclusion as this brat.

125
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:15,325
But all both of you have now are your deductions.

126
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:17,825
For now, there's no evidence.

127
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:19,525
But as to the key of this case,

128
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:22,325
that the incident occurred at around 1:00,

129
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:24,825
I think that can be overturned.

130
00:08:24,826 --> 00:08:28,025
The Kumado's...

131
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:30,425
It was just around 12:00 noon

132
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,626
when I made my first delivery.

133
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:38,325
But nobody was home,

134
00:08:38,326 --> 00:08:40,625
so I left a please contact us slip.

135
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:43,725
Then, got a call for re-delivery,

136
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:45,725
so I delivered it again later.

137
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,125
May I go now?

138
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,726
I'm sorry to have bothered you during work.

139
00:08:51,526 --> 00:08:56,225
I was just wondering because Shuko rushed out to get the package.

140
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:58,025
Yes?

141
00:08:58,026 --> 00:08:59,425
A delivery?

142
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:00,426
I'll be right out.

143
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:02,226
No, I'll go.

144
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:04,725
She probably didn't want somebody else to get it

145
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:08,225
and find out that it was a re-delivery, right?

146
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:10,125
Because she was supposed to be home watching the house.

147
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:11,825
She didn't want anyone to know

148
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:13,825
that she couldn't get the package at 12:00 noon.

149
00:09:13,826 --> 00:09:16,326
I think that Shuko was at that point...

150
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:24,526
Already tied up.

151
00:09:26,126 --> 00:09:27,926
So, that's the story.

152
00:09:29,126 --> 00:09:31,125
It all started two years ago.

153
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:33,225
When Naomi Senda witnessed.

154
00:09:33,226 --> 00:09:37,325
Shuko secretly meeting a man at the sand dunes.

155
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:41,325
Naomi began blackmailing Shuko about this.

156
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:46,025
I guess Shuko went all out each time to get the money ready.

157
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:48,025
But this can't go on forever.

158
00:09:48,026 --> 00:09:50,925
So, they both decided to gang up together,

159
00:09:50,926 --> 00:09:53,626
steal the heirloom incense burner and get cash in return for it.

160
00:09:54,726 --> 00:09:56,625
After making sure that all the members of the family had left,

161
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:59,725
Shuko hid the incense burner somewhere.

162
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:04,025
Then, she let Naomi Senda into the house from the backdoor.

163
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:07,925
Made Naomi tie both her hands and legs.

164
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:10,625
Then, hid the pendant by the sofa.

165
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:11,925
After that, she cracked the vase,

166
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:13,425
and determined the time that she was attacked

167
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:15,425
by the robber to be around 1:00.

168
00:10:15,426 --> 00:10:18,525
Finally, Naomi Senda created her alibi for that time span!

169
00:10:18,526 --> 00:10:22,325
Heck. I wasted my time and money.

170
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:25,326
It's late. That clock.

171
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,025
I'm sorry, Kazuma.

172
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:30,325
It'll be over soon.

173
00:10:30,326 --> 00:10:33,725
Waiting for the right time, Shuko called the police.

174
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:36,225
She was tied up because she wanted everyone

175
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:38,725
to believe that a robber broke in, right?

176
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:41,325
The most important thing about this fake robbery was

177
00:10:41,326 --> 00:10:44,425
that no one found out they were in this together.

178
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:48,225
So, the pendant was a prop to fight over.

179
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:50,325
They wanted to make everyone believe

180
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:52,825
that they were on bad terms with each other.

181
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:55,125
They're in the same boat.

182
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:56,725
They're finished.

183
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:58,225
But, Pops...

184
00:10:58,226 --> 00:11:01,025
I wonder why Shuko returned the incense burner?

185
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:02,125
What?

186
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:04,925
Like I said, she gave in because I appeared!

187
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:07,225
I wonder if she'd give up that easily?

188
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:10,725
She needed the money, right?

189
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:12,225
Money to keep her quiet.

190
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:14,425
Moreover, back then...

191
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:16,725
If you want, I could serve as your bodyguard.

192
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:18,125
What?

193
00:11:18,126 --> 00:11:21,025
No, I think she's just harassing me.

194
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:23,725
If she wanted to emphasize that they were on bad terms...

195
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:26,325
It would be natural to ask to be protected

196
00:11:26,326 --> 00:11:28,825
because you don't know what your enemy's going to do to you, right?

197
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:30,425
Stop blabbering!

198
00:11:30,426 --> 00:11:33,226
We'll find out the truth when we strike them with our deductions!

199
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,625
What? She went to meet Naomi Senda?

200
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:38,625
Yes. Just a while ago.

201
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:42,125
I just got a call from Naomi saying she wants to see me.

202
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:45,225
It seems she's still angry about the other day.

203
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:48,025
So, I'd like to go and apologize to her.

204
00:11:48,026 --> 00:11:52,026
Go. Soichi and I will take care of Kazuma.

205
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:57,925
Naomi Senda asked her out.

206
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,025
It happened to be good timing, too.

207
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:01,425
If the incense burner wasn't returned,

208
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:04,025
Father wouldn't have let her out that easily.

209
00:12:04,026 --> 00:12:05,625
That woman!

210
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:06,825
Since things didn't go well this time,

211
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,925
she's plotting her next scheme!

212
00:12:08,926 --> 00:12:10,325
Oh, no!

213
00:12:10,326 --> 00:12:12,725
But, if so, I don't think Shuko would've

214
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:14,825
told her family that she'd be meeting Naomi.

215
00:12:14,826 --> 00:12:16,225
Where'd she go?

216
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:18,625
She said she was going to Uradome Coast.

217
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:20,425
A coast?

218
00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:21,626
No way!

219
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:24,425
What about Shuko?

220
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:27,125
I see! I got it!

221
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:28,225
Get there in time!

222
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:30,726
The real incident is about to occur from now!

223
00:12:34,768 --> 00:12:37,068
"Uradome Coast."

224
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:44,101
"Arasuna Shrine."

225
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:54,001
Come on, hurry up and give it to me!

226
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:57,601
Let's go a little farther up.

227
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:03,601
You're both here together.

228
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:08,001
Up there there's a very steep cliff, isn't there?

229
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:11,501
You'd never make it if you fall off!

230
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:14,600
Let's change places.

231
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:17,900
And go to the Sand Dunes

232
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:19,500
where everything began two years ago,

233
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:21,300
which is also connected to the fake robbery case that occurred!

234
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,000
Fake robbery case?

235
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:26,800
No use already, Naomi.

236
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:30,000
I've seen through everything.

237
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:31,100
It's her!

238
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,700
She's the one that planned it!

239
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:35,100
Even so, who's the one that cornered her

240
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:36,701
and drove her to do what she did?

241
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:58,100
What were you planning to make Shuko do next?

242
00:13:58,101 --> 00:14:00,700
Next?

243
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:03,600
What were you going to...

244
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,101
Dad.

245
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:09,200
Just as I thought after all.

246
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:11,300
Shuko called you telling you that she got a hold of the 10 million yen

247
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:12,400
and would like to give it to you.

248
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:14,900
So to come here.

249
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,900
-Right. -What?

250
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:22,800
Shuko is the one who asked Naomi to come to the coast.

251
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:25,401
So that she could fulfill her real purpose.

252
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:30,000
So, you knew what I was up to already.

253
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:32,100
What're you talking about?

254
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:35,300
What do you mean by her real purpose, Dad?

255
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:36,700
Two years ago,

256
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:40,401
why did you secretly meet with a man, Shuko?

257
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:45,800
That's what caused all this blackmailing stuff, no?

258
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:49,900
My husband is a very kind person deep inside.

259
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:53,500
He's also the oldest son of a distinguished family.

260
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:56,400
He fell in love with me at first sight.

261
00:14:56,401 --> 00:14:59,600
Our marriage went through and my parents were delighted.

262
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:01,100
But as soon as I entered the family,

263
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:04,100
I realized that I had made a mistake.

264
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:06,600
I even considered divorce,

265
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:08,601
but when I thought about my parents, I couldn't.

266
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:13,500
One day, Mr. Kotani who was my classmate

267
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:16,200
in intermediate school gave me a call.

268
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:18,301
You mean that doctor?

269
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:25,201
He died at the beginning of this month in South Africa.

270
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:30,800
I've decided to go to South Africa.

271
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:32,900
Just like you've been saying from before!

272
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:34,700
I want you to come with me.

273
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,600
What?

274
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,500
I know.

275
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:40,800
The circumstances you're undergoing now.

276
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:43,301
I've never stopped thinking about you, you see.

277
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:49,300
If you told me a bit earlier, I may have thought about it.

278
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:51,501
I'm pregnant.

279
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:54,300
When I found out I was pregnant,

280
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:59,600
I made up my mind to dream only of my child's future.

281
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:03,400
I decided to forget and drop everything else.

282
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:04,900
I see.

283
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:06,800
I'll be praying from miles away

284
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:08,701
that a good child will be born then.

285
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:12,101
Thank you.

286
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:15,701
Take care of yourself too, Mr. Kotani.

287
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:26,301
He's a nice man, isn't he? Mrs. Kumado.

288
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:30,500
You'd be kicked out of the house

289
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:33,200
if I show this to them, wouldn't you?

290
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:36,701
But you're pregnant with a boy, so...

291
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:42,200
I know that father would do whatever it takes

292
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,800
to take the child away from me.

293
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:47,500
So, the blackmailing started

294
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:49,800
when Naomi started taking advantage of your feelings

295
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,400
of not wanting to be torn apart from your son.

296
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:52,800
However, you can only go so far

297
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:54,400
as to preparing money each time.

298
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:56,100
Besides, hush money was

299
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:58,300
only a temporary solution in the first place.

300
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:01,801
Therefore, you wanted to shut her up eternally.

301
00:17:02,701 --> 00:17:04,800
Shuko's real purpose was to...

302
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:05,801
No, it can't be.

303
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:09,200
You mean... You were thinking of killing me.

304
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:11,200
I thought I had no other choice.

305
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:12,400
But there must've been a trigger

306
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:14,800
that drove you to make up your mind.

307
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,701
I think it was when you saw the news on Mr. Kotani's death.

308
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:23,000
Dr. Kotani, who unfortunately got involved in an accident,

309
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,500
was carrying out medical activities there...

310
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:28,000
Kotani... You mean that guy back then

311
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:30,100
was a doctor?

312
00:17:30,101 --> 00:17:32,400
When his identity became known,

313
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:35,400
I was overtaken by fear of being trapped.

314
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:37,700
So, you made up your mind to kill her.

315
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:41,000
And in order to not get caught after killing her,

316
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,901
you thought up the fake robbery.

317
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:47,200
What's it about?

318
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:50,400
I got Naomi into this.

319
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:52,800
I told her that we'd steal the heirloom incense burner

320
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:55,500
and blackmail Kumado for a large sum of money.

321
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:57,700
And that I'd give her all of it,

322
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,100
so let's end this deal once and for all.

323
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:02,000
She told me that even if the police kept guard over the house,

324
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:03,800
as long as we could get him to prepare the cash,

325
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:07,500
she would sneak in at night and steal the cash.

326
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:09,500
You believed her story,

327
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:11,100
came back to Tottori

328
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:14,800
where the fake robbery was carried out.

329
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,800
Just as planned.

330
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:18,700
How dare you lie like that?

331
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:20,900
-I tell you, stop lying! -Stop it!

332
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:22,800
I'll pay you back for all of this,

333
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,301
so just you wait and see.

334
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:29,800
I... I'm going to be killed by her.

335
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:32,500
You thought that it was a sham

336
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:35,400
to make it look as though you two didn't get along.

337
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:37,700
That's what we talked over.

338
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,900
You've got it all wrong.

339
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,800
The person that Shuko was after

340
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:43,800
was the one she called to come to the coast

341
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:46,100
so that she could hand the money over.

342
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:49,301
Come on, hurry up and give it to me! The money!

343
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:59,101
After fulfilling her purpose, Shuko was going to...

344
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:02,700
No matter how much I apologized about the other day,

345
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:06,300
Naomi refused to forgive me.

346
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:09,000
Then, she tried to push me off from here.

347
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:12,700
I desperately fought back to protect myself.

348
00:19:12,701 --> 00:19:14,300
And by the time, I realized it...

349
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:17,600
You did mention that she may come after you and kill you.

350
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:20,600
I wouldn't be surprised if that violent woman did.

351
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:23,101
Self-defense would be applied to a case like this.

352
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:27,900
You're not guilty of anything!

353
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,601
We, the police more than anyone else can see that.

354
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:33,100
After killing Naomi,

355
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:35,000
you were going to try to get away with it

356
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:37,400
by saying that you did so in self-defense.

357
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:39,200
The fake robbery that was committed was

358
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:41,900
set up just to carry this out.

359
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:44,600
Which means I was called to come to Tottori

360
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,400
for the sole sake of being killed?

361
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:49,400
However, in order to go through with this scheme,

362
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:52,000
she would have to make it out here alone.

363
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:53,700
But under the highly strained circumstance

364
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:55,500
of the incense burner being stolen,

365
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:59,500
the head of the household would never let her out.

366
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:01,900
Therefore, you returned the incense burner.

367
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,700
And you refused being watched by a bodyguard.

368
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:06,800
Because if a detective is stuck to you,

369
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:09,400
you won't be able to move about freely.

370
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:12,500
But everything I did was in vain.

371
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:15,100
Because Mr. Mouri saw through it all.

372
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:16,300
But, Dad...

373
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:19,500
Yeah, attempted murder cannot be applied here.

374
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:22,200
But this woman actually tried to kill me!

375
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:23,700
But she didn't, did she?

376
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:26,600
She just schemed it, but didn't lay a finger on you!

377
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,101
No...

378
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:35,700
But the result is the same.

379
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:36,701
What?

380
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,700
The fake robbery cannot be erased.

381
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:46,300
I'm guilty of the crime of stealing the precious heirloom,

382
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:48,500
I'm going to be kicked out of the Kumado family.

383
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:51,300
I'll be torn apart from Kazuma!

384
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:52,800
No way.

385
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:54,700
There's nothing a detective can do

386
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:57,300
when it comes to the affairs of families other than my own.

387
00:20:57,301 --> 00:20:58,801
You've got me!

388
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:08,600
I'll cut ties with the family.

389
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,900
My kid brother Junji can inherit the estate.

390
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:14,600
You, Kazuma and I...

391
00:21:14,601 --> 00:21:17,500
We can start a new family together!

392
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:19,900
Dear.

393
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:22,600
I'll bet you didn't know,

394
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:26,101
but I really love you, Shuko.

395
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:56,700
-Stop pushing me! -Okay.

396
00:22:56,701 --> 00:22:58,001
Shuko.

397
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:02,000
I'll wait for you.

398
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:05,300
Together with Kazuma.

399
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,900
Thank you.

400
00:23:06,901 --> 00:23:08,701
I'm happy for them.

401
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:11,900
Mr. Mouri.

402
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:15,000
You're my pride and joy, after all.

403
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:19,000
Dad! Did you hear what he just said?

404
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:21,401
I don't think he can.

405
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,601
Crab, I want to eat crab...

406
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:29,700
On the other side of that, if I remember correctly...

407
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:31,901
The sea. Right?

408
00:23:33,001 --> 00:23:35,801
-Pops! -Dad!

409
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:44,000
"Next Episode" -What's that?

410
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:45,600
No joke?

411
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:47,600
Are you sure about that, Genta?

412
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm sure.

413
00:23:49,001 --> 00:23:51,300
Whenever I go to by Eel's over rice lunch,

414
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:54,300
he always buying the large size Nori Bento.

415
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:56,101
It's him! Him!

416
00:23:57,601 --> 00:24:00,500
Hey, do you want to eat eels?

417
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:02,300
Arsonist?

418
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:03,600
Who is this?

419
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:07,100
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

420
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:12,501
Next Conan, "Pitfall of Fire Prevention"
