1
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:05,871
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,571
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:09,371
The treasure of the Gods is finally found!

4
00:00:09,372 --> 00:00:11,971
Did Thief Kid get it or did the Youth Detective Squad get it?

5
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:13,571
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:15,171
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,172 --> 00:00:17,372
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,559
We came along to camp together with Dr. Agasa.

9
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,359
Genta and the others find a mysterious looking stone

10
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,459
near a suspicious looking mansion.

11
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,859
There are codes concerning the Big Jewel there.

12
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,659
And besides it,

13
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,960
we find a body of a man who had been strangled to death.

14
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,059
We then enter the mysterious looking mansion of tricks

15
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,659
where we encounter two treasure hunters

16
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,760
and an queer old woman.

17
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,959
I guess we'll have to find the other sacred treasure

18
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,259
to solve the mystery.

19
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,859
The other?

20
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,359
They're called the three sacred treasures.

21
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,559
The mirror and the comma-shaped bead were found,

22
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,759
so there should be one more somewhere.

23
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,759
The three sacred treasures?

24
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,659
Yes. The mirror is the Mirror of Yata,

25
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,759
the comma-shaped bead is called the Magatama of Yasakani.

26
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,559
And the remaining one

27
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,459
is the sword of the Gods.

28
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,759
It got its name because it is said to have saved God Takeru Yamato,

29
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,659
who was in a pinch

30
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,959
by slashing down the grass when fire was set to the field.

31
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,660
The Sword of Kusanagi.

32
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,660
"Adventure at an Eccentric Mansion - Case Closed."

33
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,059
I know about that Sword of Kusanagi!

34
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,159
It's the fantastic sword that comes out a lot in games, right?

35
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,859
The Sword of Kusanagi?

36
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,659
If we look at the writings on that sword,

37
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,460
we may be able to figure something out.

38
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,459
Before searching for the treasure,

39
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:28,159
I think our priority is to get out of this basement cell.

40
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,059
If it is about getting out of here,

41
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,460
he should know it.

42
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,559
Unless you already came here once and read the writings on the gravestone,

43
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,759
you wouldn't be hiding that stone mirror that you have on you.

44
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,959
Yes, yes.

45
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,560
Let me show you the way.

46
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,359
What a large house.

47
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,660
The basement is strangely large.

48
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,759
The floor's starting to get wet.

49
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
Yes.

50
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,459
Water is flowing in from somewhere.

51
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,360
There! Over there.

52
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,660
What's that trace that looks as if something had moved out of place.

53
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,359
Now that you mentioned it, there was an earthquake a little while ago.

54
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,760
That's why the house moved a bit, and water from below flowed out.

55
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,859
Just as Kichiemon says,

56
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,959
maybe God Nioh is angry.

57
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,960
Telling us to quit treasure hunting and quickly go back home.

58
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,359
Hey, the notebook that the man who was found in the swamp,

59
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,759
it's dry now and are readable.

60
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,159
It seems that he was killed by his partner.

61
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,559
"I've teamed up with a dangerous guy.

62
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,959
I've got to hide this stone I found, or he'll kill me.

63
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
Poison rat says he's going to kill me

64
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:53,959
and take the treasure all for himself."

65
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,660
After that, it's ripped so I can't read on.

66
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,760
Amazing!

67
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
Amazing!

68
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,459
Is this smoke comes from a hot spring or something?

69
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,460
Yes.

70
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:17,160
Kichiemon probably dug it up.

71
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,159
To hide this entrance with steam.

72
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,259
-I see. -Fantastic!

73
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,959
What a red hot spring.

74
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,360
I wonder if it contains a lot of iron?

75
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,659
Hey, brat!

76
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,659
That's not the exit.

77
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,860
Brat!

78
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,660
Conan, what's up?

79
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,260
Are you all right?

80
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,259
Hey, do you know?

81
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,859
Do you know where the Sword of Kusanagi came out from?

82
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,259
What?

83
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,159
I'm sure you've all heard about the story of Susano,

84
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,759
the kid brother of Oomikami Ametarasu,

85
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,759
making a monster drink sake to get it drunk

86
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,359
and eventually defeat it in order to rescue Princess Kushinada.

87
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,959
And the sword that came out of the tail of the monster

88
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,959
was the Sword of Ameno Murakumo,

89
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,259
which later became known as the Sword of Kusanagi.

90
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,259
Don't tell me that monster

91
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,959
is the one that often comes out in stories of long ago.

92
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,059
Yes.

93
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,459
Its eye are flaming red like those of an ogre

94
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,059
and its stomach is inflamed with blood.

95
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,060
Although it has just one body,

96
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:23,659
it is the legendary eight-headed dragon with eight heads and eight tails.

97
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,459
Look at the basin of this waterfall.

98
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,860
Doesn't it look very similar...

99
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,760
to the eight-headed dragon?

100
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,759
I see.

101
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,259
The waterfall is the dragon's neck and the branches its tails.

102
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,559
Which means that the sword is in one of the branches?

103
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,959
Yes. According to the legend, the sword came out of the tail in the middle.

104
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,359
In other words, the Sword of Kusanagi should be up ahead of this branch.

105
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,859
Don't tell me you plan to dive through the hot water?

106
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,759
Forget it! There's nothing there.

107
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,859
What if it's the bottom of the valley up ahead?

108
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,660
But we came this far, so I want to see what there is up ahead.

109
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,559
Something is rising.

110
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,160
The water level is decreasing.

111
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,059
Now, we can go through the hole!

112
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,459
All right!

113
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,459
Okay! Let's go.

114
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,560
Hold it, Genta!

115
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,060
Out of my way!

116
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,559
Hey, Granny!

117
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,660
Darn it!

118
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,560
That is indeed the Sword of Kusanagi!

119
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,160
So you were after the treasure, too.

120
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,659
What a dangerous trap.

121
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,459
When you try to get close to the sword,

122
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,159
weight bears down on the floor and blades come flying from all directions.

123
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,359
I guess he doesn't want it to be taken, does he?

124
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,760
No, it's not just an ordinary mean trap.

125
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,059
Blades come from all directions.

126
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,060
Conan!

127
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:36,059
And the blades settling in all four directions

128
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,359
only goes to show that the timing is slightly synchronized

129
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,160
so that they won't bump into each other.

130
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,560
Moreover...

131
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,559
the fact that there is a handle like this on the blade,

132
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,760
is telling you to use it to go over to the sword!

133
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,459
He got to the other side!

134
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,860
Conan is amazing!

135
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,360
-What's written on it? -What's written on the sword?

136
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,759
Dragon.

137
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,859
-Dragon? -Dragon?

138
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,860
Forever, flames and dragon.

139
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,759
Just as expected of Kichiemon!

140
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,259
It probably means, suffer in agony forever

141
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,859
as if being burned by the flames of the dragon.

142
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,459
So let's forget about treasure hunting and go home.

143
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,459
Maybe there was no treasure to begin with anyway.

144
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,659
What's with you?

145
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,260
You were going all out to get it just a while ago.

146
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,760
"Lost ones, offer the sacred treasure to me."

147
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,059
Forever.

148
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,459
Flames.

149
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,759
Dragon.

150
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,660
"Offer me..."

151
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,359
"To me!"

152
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,159
Hey, Conan!

153
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,360
Conan!

154
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,660
Can you still come back here?

155
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,060
Oh, my.

156
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,859
You look satisfied. So, you've figured something out?

157
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,159
Really, Conan?

158
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,659
No.

159
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,659
This look on my face is a wretched look that says,

160
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,060
"Let's hurry up and head on home."

161
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,660
Are you serious?

162
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,359
Hey, Conan.

163
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,559
Are you serious about heading home?

164
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,559
After we found the mysterious three sacred treasures?

165
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,860
You're going to forget about the diamond?

166
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,759
The words that are carved on the sacred treasures,

167
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,459
flames, forever and dragon, as far as the meaning is concerned

168
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,759
and as to the meaning of the writings in the stone lantern,

169
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,959
I don't have the slightest idea.

170
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,360
I guess I'll get going then.

171
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,860
I guess I'll check this mansion a bit more, too.

172
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,959
We finally made it outside.

173
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,759
It seems Dr. Agasa hasn't come back yet.

174
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,059
Doctor?

175
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,560
Dr. Agasa is suppose to bring some police officers here.

176
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,059
I guess you'll be able to get out of these mountains even without me.

177
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,859
If you don't want God Nioh to curse you,

178
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,660
don't dilly-dally and head on home right away.

179
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,459
Now that all the people you don't want around have left,

180
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,360
lead the way, will you?

181
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,660
To where the treasure is.

182
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Come on, Conan.

183
00:12:00,335 --> 00:12:01,934
Then, you...

184
00:12:01,935 --> 00:12:04,534
You figured out the code!

185
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:07,634
It was written on the gravestone in the basement, right?

186
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:11,534
"Lost ones, offer the sacred treasure to me."

187
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:14,934
The "me" here refers to Kichiemon Samizu.

188
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,434
In other words, it's telling you to add the kanji character "Mizu"

189
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:19,234
to the characters of the sacred treasures.

190
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:20,934
The words that were found on the three sacred treasures

191
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:22,134
were "Hono" for flames...

192
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:23,734
And "El" for forever.

193
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:25,834
And "Ryu" for dragon!

194
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:27,835
What happens when you put "Sanzui" alongside it?

195
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:33,335
The character "Hono" for flames becomes "Awa" as in Awaji Island!

196
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:37,535
The character "El" becomes "ei", the character for the word swimming!

197
00:12:41,335 --> 00:12:43,135
The character "Ryu" becomes "taki", the character for waterfall.

198
00:12:44,435 --> 00:12:47,334
Does it mean to go swimming in the waterfall of Awaji Island?

199
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:51,134
It said on the gravestone in the basement "Lost ones", right?

200
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:53,134
That was a hint for those who couldn't figure out

201
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:55,334
the code of the stone lanterns.

202
00:12:55,335 --> 00:12:56,534
The writing on the lantern said,

203
00:12:56,535 --> 00:12:58,134
a place nearest to the sun,

204
00:12:58,135 --> 00:13:01,334
in an extremely busy location where the elders get together.

205
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:04,634
When you put this together with the three characters,

206
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:06,434
the place nearest to the sun is Mercury,

207
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:08,934
the first planet in the solar system.

208
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:12,134
The elders refer to the carps with whiskers.

209
00:13:12,135 --> 00:13:15,934
The busy place means a place where the sound of the water never stops.

210
00:13:15,935 --> 00:13:23,434
In other words, the stone of the God Nioh, the diamond

211
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,234
is hidden near the waterfall where a lot of carps swim in fresh water!

212
00:13:25,235 --> 00:13:26,634
Amazing, Conan!

213
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:28,034
It's the waterfall in the basement!

214
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:30,334
It's where the eight-headed dragon is.

215
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:33,735
Too bad. That's a hot spring and not fresh water.

216
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:38,234
Maybe it's the river that was in the house?

217
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,834
There were lots of carps swimming inside, too.

218
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:43,434
But there was no waterfall.

219
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:45,334
Oh, that's right.

220
00:13:45,335 --> 00:13:48,734
Listen carefully.

221
00:13:48,735 --> 00:13:50,234
You hear it, don't you?

222
00:13:50,235 --> 00:13:52,934
It's leading us to where the treasure is.

223
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:54,535
That sound.

224
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,234
I see!

225
00:13:57,235 --> 00:13:59,334
It's at the first swamp that we saw.

226
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:00,534
Let's go!

227
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:01,735
Okay!

228
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:06,134
Hey.

229
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:09,034
That body is gone.

230
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:10,134
Yes.

231
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:14,434
The killer hid it again after we entered the house.

232
00:14:14,435 --> 00:14:15,635
What're you talking about?

233
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:17,935
About a body.

234
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:22,534
Do you see anything?

235
00:14:22,535 --> 00:14:26,934
Well, it's dark and I can't tell unless I dive in there or something.

236
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:28,735
Too bad.

237
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:35,434
He seems to have gotten there before you.

238
00:14:35,435 --> 00:14:37,034
Sarina.

239
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:39,034
Just when did she get here?

240
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:41,434
Look behind the waterfall.

241
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:43,334
Behind the waterfall?

242
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:45,835
There is a card or something up there.

243
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:49,534
"Thanks for the stone of the God Nioh."

244
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:51,534
Thief Kid?

245
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:53,934
-Oh, no. -No joke!

246
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,535
Seriously?

247
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:59,934
He is indeed the great thief under the heavens.

248
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:03,234
Well, if the stone was taken by the great thief that deceives the world,

249
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,934
I guess puppet maker Kichiemon couldn't have asked for more.

250
00:15:06,935 --> 00:15:11,435
Granny, I thought you went home.

251
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:14,934
What's up?

252
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:16,335
Mitsuhiko!

253
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:33,234
Are you all right?

254
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:34,734
Let's pull out of here!

255
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:37,135
There seems to be nothing here.

256
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:41,835
I found something!

257
00:15:44,135 --> 00:15:47,234
It was hidden in the mud,

258
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:48,334
but there was definitely a stone that was shining

259
00:15:48,335 --> 00:15:49,735
at the bottom of the swamp.

260
00:15:53,835 --> 00:15:55,334
It's mine!

261
00:15:55,335 --> 00:15:57,735
Hey! Don't take it!

262
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:01,434
Those who do not fear the rage of the God Nioh,

263
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:05,134
get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand

264
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:07,934
and learn from the proverb of long ago.

265
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,735
Proverb of long ago...

266
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:16,234
Don't move!

267
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:18,835
Who would've thought it was hidden with mud?

268
00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:22,834
I didn't search that well and was about to overlook it,

269
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:25,835
thanks to that card.

270
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:30,834
Go on, line up on that side!

271
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:34,734
When that man comes out from the water holding the treasure,

272
00:16:34,735 --> 00:16:37,335
I'll give you all a good dunk in the water together.

273
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:40,934
You've finally shown your true identity.

274
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:42,235
Thief Kid!

275
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,334
She is?

276
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:46,934
I'm the Thief Kid?

277
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:48,334
Don't be silly, I'm...

278
00:16:48,335 --> 00:16:51,234
You're the poison rat that killed your partner

279
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:54,335
in order to hog the treasure all for yourself, right?

280
00:16:55,635 --> 00:17:01,035
When that guy showed the stone mirror, you said...

281
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:05,434
Which means that the one that you kids found

282
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:08,534
had something like flames carved on it?

283
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:09,735
Isn't that right?

284
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:15,234
Back then, all I said was I found a stone sacred treasure.

285
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,934
So how did you know

286
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,634
that what we found was not the sword, but the comma-shaped bead?

287
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:22,434
You knew because you're the one who tore off the page from the notebook

288
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:25,334
of the man that you sunk to the bottom of the swamp.

289
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,534
You took the diagram that showed that the character flames

290
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:30,434
was written inside the comma-shaped bead.

291
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:33,835
How did you find out what was written?

292
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:38,934
The notes were written in pencil,

293
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:41,935
so you could see slight traces on the paper.

294
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:46,134
So you're a bit smart.

295
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:47,834
But also careless, kid.

296
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:50,534
You come close to the gun barrel from your side.

297
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:52,635
Right. I had to do this...

298
00:18:03,635 --> 00:18:06,835
or else that anesthetic needle won't hit you directly.

299
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:12,734
But that was suprising.

300
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:15,934
That woman is Thief Kid.

301
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,635
No. Thief Kid is...

302
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:22,734
I've got the stone of the God Nioh!

303
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,335
No!

304
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:48,234
Hurry and put the diamond back where it was!

305
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:49,235
What?

306
00:18:49,236 --> 00:18:50,934
Otherwise you'll drift down to the bottom of the valley

307
00:18:50,935 --> 00:18:52,135
together with the water!

308
00:18:58,035 --> 00:19:00,635
There it is.

309
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:03,335
It's that mansion!

310
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:26,934
That diamond was the switch to this huge trap.

311
00:19:26,935 --> 00:19:31,734
He had no intention of letting anybody have the treasure to begin with.

312
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:36,734
Yes. Diamonds, because of their impenetrable hardness,

313
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:39,834
once used to be called adamas from which the word adamant,

314
00:19:39,835 --> 00:19:41,234
meaning utterly unyielding was derived.

315
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:43,234
Therefore, learn from the proverb of long ago

316
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:45,334
means the treasure shall never be taken.

317
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:47,734
Well, when the Shogunate collapsed,

318
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:50,434
not wanting the ones who overthrew the government to confiscate his assets,

319
00:19:50,435 --> 00:19:54,434
it's most likely that Kichiemon thought this up.

320
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:58,934
That's why you stole it once but decided against it. Right, granny?

321
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:02,035
Or rather, the greatest thief under the heavens.

322
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:15,234
There he is!

323
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:17,334
-Thief Kid! -Thief Kid!

324
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:20,434
Exactly. Good work.

325
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:23,034
The wall of the mansion that was slightly raised, and the basement passage

326
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:25,634
that was slightly out of place where the water came gushing out.

327
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:28,634
Contrary to what was written on the card, the jewel was not taken.

328
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:33,234
And shouting, "Don't take it!" all points

329
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:37,234
to none other than the fact that granny is Thief Kid.

330
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:39,134
Bingo!

331
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:44,234
Well, I didn't take it also because it was not what I was after.

332
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:48,334
That's why you said, "Let's forget about the treasure hunt and go home."

333
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:53,134
But you knocked me down and tried to take the sword.

334
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:56,234
That was to rescue you, Genta.

335
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:58,634
If he didn't go in before you and make you realize there was a trap there,

336
00:20:58,635 --> 00:21:01,335
you would've been slashed to pieces.

337
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:07,034
So he waited for us in the basement

338
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:08,434
so that we wouldn't get caught by the traps?

339
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,634
My, my.

340
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,734
What a heart-warming and touching thief we have.

341
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:15,934
I'm truly honored by your words, little lady.

342
00:21:15,935 --> 00:21:21,334
Well, I'll let you go for today since you rescued my friends from danger.

343
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:25,134
But I'll expose you to the light of day for sure someday,

344
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:26,335
so don't forget that.

345
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:34,034
I'll peel off that cape of yours as well as make you show yourself.

346
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:36,334
I advise you not to.

347
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:41,434
Pandora opened the box because she didn't know what was inside.

348
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:44,335
Knowing the contents before opening the treasure box...

349
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:51,935
is no fun.

350
00:21:56,635 --> 00:21:58,134
You idiot.

351
00:21:58,135 --> 00:22:00,434
It's the work of a detective

352
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:02,535
to find out what's inside before opening the box.

353
00:23:30,335 --> 00:23:32,734
So, what now?

354
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:34,234
That's right.

355
00:23:34,235 --> 00:23:37,834
Since the jewel was returned, it seems the water is receding.

356
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:41,134
I guess we have no choice but to wait for help to come.

357
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:42,735
What happened to Dr. Agasa?

358
00:23:52,335 --> 00:23:54,535
Better not let go.

359
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,834
"Next Episode" -The victim is the person who lives here,

360
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:01,034
Ms. Fumie Ozawa, age 24,

361
00:24:01,035 --> 00:24:02,635
She works for financial institution.

362
00:24:08,435 --> 00:24:10,535
Manner mode? At home?

363
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:16,535
Etsuko or Mr. Shimizu, which of them is the killer?

364
00:24:17,535 --> 00:24:18,834
Huh?

365
00:24:18,835 --> 00:24:20,934
Pops, I wonder what this is?

366
00:24:20,935 --> 00:24:26,935
Next Conan, "Spicy, Bitter and Sweet Flavour".

367
00:24:42,735 --> 00:24:45,434
Next Conan's Hint:

368
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:46,934
"Powder."

369
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:47,935
What are you guys doing during Golden Week?

370
00:24:47,935 --> 00:24:48,935
-What else... -But going...

371
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:51,635
-to the movie called... -"Strategy Above the Depths..."
