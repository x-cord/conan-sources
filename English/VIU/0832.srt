1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,880
We arrived at the filming site of a zombie movie.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,480
We encounter the staff who came to film a sequel of the movie there.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,180
But during the filming,

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,180
Mr. Takashi Harawaki, the producer, dies.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,680
Furthermore, amidst the commotion of the zombie audition,

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,280
Ms. Kyoko Ejiri, the cameraman, died too.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,880
A canvas stained black with crime.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,980
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,080
Although Inspector Yamamura stirs things up,

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,480
The Heiji-Conan duo solve the mystery in an unexpected way.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,280
He sees through the one and only truth.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,380
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,780
His name is Detective Conan!

14
00:02:18,352 --> 00:02:23,552
"The Villa Surrounded by Zombies (Part 3)"

15
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:28,152
Excuse me...

16
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:33,852
The zombies said, they brought police officers

17
00:02:33,852 --> 00:02:36,352
from the Gunma Prefectural Police Department.

18
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:38,452
Ran?

19
00:02:38,452 --> 00:02:41,152
The Gunma Prefectural Police?

20
00:02:41,152 --> 00:02:42,852
Which means that...

21
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:45,052
Don't tell me...

22
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:46,952
Those having problems with zombies,

23
00:02:46,952 --> 00:02:50,152
sorry to keep you all waiting!

24
00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:53,052
There's nothing to worry about anymore now

25
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:55,352
that monster hunter Yamamura is here for you.

26
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:01,952
Zombies...

27
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:04,652
Zombies everywhere.

28
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:08,252
Begone, evil spirits...

29
00:03:08,252 --> 00:03:09,952
-Hey! -What?

30
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,452
What're you doing?

31
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:13,252
The corpse is upstairs.

32
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:15,852
You guys?

33
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:17,852
I see...

34
00:03:17,852 --> 00:03:19,652
So you're saying...

35
00:03:19,652 --> 00:03:22,352
After finishing filming the movie trailer,

36
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:26,952
the two of you went to call Mr. Harawaki because it was time for lunch.

37
00:03:26,952 --> 00:03:30,752
But he was collapsed in the room next to this one,

38
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:34,852
and on the phone he was holding, a video of him taking the poison,

39
00:03:34,852 --> 00:03:37,952
and something that looked to be a suicide note were displayed.

40
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:42,352
Then the surprise Zombies that Mr. Harawaki called over scared you

41
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:44,852
and you instructed the staff to evacuate upstairs.

42
00:03:44,852 --> 00:03:48,852
While you two were fighting the zombies downstairs,

43
00:03:48,852 --> 00:03:51,052
Ms. Kyoko Ejiri was for some reason

44
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:53,852
was slashed on the neck and killed, correct?

45
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:55,552
Yeah, that's right.

46
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:58,752
Furthermore, a video of her being bitten on the neck

47
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,152
was left on the cell phone,

48
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:04,152
along with the perpetrator who did this to her and committed suicide.

49
00:04:04,152 --> 00:04:05,152
And that supposed perpetrator, Mr. Harawaki,

50
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:08,852
suddenly disappears from the room he committed suicide in.

51
00:04:08,852 --> 00:04:12,952
This can mean nothing more than that he...

52
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:18,752
Mr. Harawaki turned into a zombie and killed Kyoko!

53
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:21,052
How frightening! Scary!

54
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,452
I thought that what he'd say.

55
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:24,752
I guess this was to be expected.

56
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:28,252
Then, where did that Mr. Harawaki disappear to anyway?

57
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:30,552
I think he fled amidst the zombies?

58
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:33,852
That's why he called so many zombies over!

59
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:34,952
Gosh.

60
00:04:34,952 --> 00:04:36,452
Everything falls into place.

61
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:39,852
If not, this video couldn't exist!

62
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:43,052
It kept on recording until you stopped it, right?

63
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:44,052
Yeah.

64
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:47,652
If let's say he tricked the victim Kyoko and tried taking that video,

65
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:49,052
I don't think she would go as far as

66
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:52,452
to cooperate being bitten by a zombie and killed!

67
00:04:52,452 --> 00:04:54,852
In the first place, Kyoko is a cameraman

68
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:56,452
and not an actress, correct?

69
00:04:56,452 --> 00:04:58,352
Well, it seems she was an actress eight years ago

70
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:03,252
when they filmed a zombie movie back when she was in college, though.

71
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:05,852
I'm sure that they would all check the image of the videos

72
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:08,452
they've taken for themselves,

73
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:11,052
Besides, you can tell just by looking at it, right?

74
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:13,252
What?

75
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:16,252
Nobody saw the video that was taken eight years ago?

76
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:17,852
Is that true?

77
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:18,852
Yes.

78
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,452
"Ria Kawabata (29)" -Because the chief told us that

79
00:05:21,452 --> 00:05:24,652
he'd show us the video after he edited and compiled the videos.

80
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:28,052
That's why even Kyoko, who was cameraman, back then complained that

81
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:30,252
she may have parts that she wanted to do a retake of

82
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:34,252
"Orie Baisho (29)" -but couldn't!

83
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:35,552
"Tetsuto Naito (38)" -I'm sure that my brother

84
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:38,652
considered you all as his first audience

85
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:42,152
and was looking forward to how you would react.

86
00:05:42,152 --> 00:05:43,152
And?

87
00:05:43,152 --> 00:05:47,152
What kind of role did Mr. Harawaki and Kyoko play in that movie?

88
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:49,652
If I remember correctly,

89
00:05:49,652 --> 00:05:54,252
Harawaki who turns into a zombie tries to attack Kyoko

90
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:55,652
but since they were lovers before,

91
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:57,352
he didn't attack her, correct?

92
00:05:57,352 --> 00:06:00,552
Isn't that scenario the one that chief got rid of

93
00:06:00,552 --> 00:06:02,752
because he said love was unnecessary in zombie movies?

94
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:04,552
Come to think of it,

95
00:06:04,552 --> 00:06:06,552
Harawaki mentioned that he didn't just want to become a zombie,

96
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:08,952
but resisted to some extent.

97
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,252
That's a first.

98
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:11,252
What's this?

99
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:14,052
Nobody remembers for sure?

100
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:15,052
Hey.

101
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:20,052
Did the data for that movie really go missing?

102
00:06:20,052 --> 00:06:21,152
Yes.

103
00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:23,052
Kyoko said so, didn't she?

104
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:25,352
"Masahaschi Ninomiya (29)" -But Harawaki told me

105
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:28,852
that he had it in his tablet.

106
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:31,152
Was he carrying it around?

107
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:34,052
Yes. If it was his mini tablet, Harawaki...

108
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:38,452
Always carried it around in the chest pocket of his jacket.

109
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:39,452
Let's see.

110
00:06:40,552 --> 00:06:41,752
This is it.

111
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:45,052
No good!

112
00:06:45,052 --> 00:06:47,952
The data is all deleted.

113
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:51,352
But if it's the picture that we took with everybody in it

114
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:54,752
when were taking that movie, I have it!

115
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:55,852
See!

116
00:06:57,752 --> 00:07:02,352
This T shirt that Kyoko is wearing.

117
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:03,852
This is the T shirt that

118
00:07:03,852 --> 00:07:05,852
Kyoko used to favor and wear,

119
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:09,052
a brand of a shop that has T shirts with capitalized "E" on it.

120
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:11,652
She said because her last name is Ejiri,

121
00:07:11,652 --> 00:07:14,352
she had various colors of this T shirt.

122
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:18,852
Talking about clothes, before was killed Kyoko had taken off her top,

123
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:20,452
but do you know why?

124
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:22,352
It was a bit damp too, right?

125
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:23,552
I wonder.

126
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:26,052
Maybe she perspired so she changed clothes?

127
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:29,752
Come to think of it, she was saying even during the filming

128
00:07:29,752 --> 00:07:33,652
that she wanted to take a bath and get change as soon as possible.

129
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:34,652
That was about an hour

130
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:38,552
before we started searching for Mr. Harawaki, wasn't it?

131
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:39,752
Right! That's right!

132
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:44,052
During the break I also went to the restroom

133
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:46,052
but something strange happened!

134
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:47,652
Something strange?

135
00:07:47,652 --> 00:07:49,952
Ran, who used the restroom before me warned me that

136
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:55,052
there was only one roll of toilet paper left, so to be careful,

137
00:07:55,052 --> 00:07:56,952
but when I went inside I found no extra rolls of toilet paper at all.

138
00:07:56,952 --> 00:07:58,952
But when I went to the restroom just a while ago,

139
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:02,552
there was a roll of extra toilet paper inside!

140
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:06,552
That's... That's a bit creepy, isn't it?

141
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,652
Well, as to how that roll was used.

142
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:11,352
I have an idea.

143
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:13,452
What? You know too, Conan?

144
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,652
No!

145
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:17,352
I'm just copying Heiji!

146
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:24,052
There seems to be no hidden doors or anything inside the room.

147
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:26,752
The only thing you can use toilet paper for is

148
00:08:26,752 --> 00:08:31,152
if you want to go from being a zombie to a mummy.

149
00:08:31,152 --> 00:08:32,352
Wait...

150
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:37,852
The beads of the rosary that were in the top drawer

151
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:40,352
came out of the drawer below.

152
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:41,552
Why?

153
00:08:41,552 --> 00:08:43,252
I see.

154
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:45,052
You can't see what's right under your nose.

155
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:47,352
This is what it's all about.

156
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:49,652
Come to think of it, I didn't ask you,

157
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:52,452
but did you come all the way here from Osaka on the motorbike?

158
00:08:52,452 --> 00:08:53,752
Nope,

159
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:56,152
we arrived in Tokyo on the bullet train

160
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:58,052
and rented a motorbike from there,

161
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:00,952
because we heard that it was a villa out in the remote mountains.

162
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:04,452
Which means you insisted on coming along again, Kazuha?

163
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:06,952
Heiji's the one who asked me to come along.

164
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:10,552
He said he had something important he wanted to talk to me about...

165
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:12,352
Something important to talk about?

166
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:16,752
What?

167
00:09:16,752 --> 00:09:17,852
You've figured out the perpetrator,

168
00:09:17,852 --> 00:09:19,552
so you'd like to disclose the mystery?

169
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:22,052
Yeah. Me and this boy.

170
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:25,452
Did you figure out who the perpetrator is too, Conan?

171
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:27,152
No!

172
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:30,052
I'm just helping Heiji out!

173
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:31,652
I see.

174
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:34,752
I guess there'll no Sleeping Kogoro.

175
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:38,452
Because he's sick over poisoned mushroom.

176
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:40,652
Funny!

177
00:09:40,652 --> 00:09:42,152
What's with him?

178
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:44,952
But, isn't Harawaki the perpetrator?

179
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,052
Yeah!

180
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,452
Because there was a video of him attacking Kyoko, right?

181
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:52,152
Besides, even the video of him drinking poison

182
00:09:52,152 --> 00:09:54,052
and committing suicide too.

183
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,752
How are you going to explain that video?

184
00:09:57,852 --> 00:10:00,352
That's the video of the movie

185
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:03,752
that was filmed here eight years ago by all of you.

186
00:10:03,752 --> 00:10:05,152
-What? -What?

187
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:08,852
The video that was saved in Mr. Harawaki's tablet

188
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:11,252
was recorded using the cell phone.

189
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:13,252
Then simultaneous to black out,

190
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:15,352
the side of the cell phone with the lens on it

191
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:17,652
was placed face down on the chair

192
00:10:17,652 --> 00:10:21,352
and the floor while the device kept on recording as is.

193
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:25,152
But was there a scene where Harawaki drank poison?

194
00:10:25,152 --> 00:10:26,252
Beats me?

195
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:30,552
Mr. Harawaki mentioned that he not only just wanted to be a zombie

196
00:10:30,552 --> 00:10:32,252
but wanted to resist, right?

197
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:36,252
So, maybe he took the video secretly with the chief.

198
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:39,852
The part where he drank the poison and committed suicide.

199
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:42,752
Besides the first script was about the star of the show

200
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:45,752
using the Zombie Blade to kill all of his friends

201
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:49,252
who turned into zombies one after the other, wasn't it?

202
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:50,952
Yeah.

203
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:53,352
If so, should be around somewhere,

204
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:56,052
the video of the scene that Mr. Harawaki bites onto Kyoko

205
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:58,652
and turns her into a zombie.

206
00:10:58,652 --> 00:11:02,552
The perpetrator used it to his advantage!

207
00:11:02,552 --> 00:11:06,152
But, it's hard to believe this is something that was taken in the past.

208
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:08,952
We filmed here, so the background is the same.

209
00:11:08,952 --> 00:11:11,752
The proof is right there on the monitor!

210
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:26,524
Before Mr. Harawaki died he had a goatee,

211
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:29,024
but he didn't have one in the video

212
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:31,924
and the color of his pants is slightly different too.

213
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,324
Kyoko had lipstick on,

214
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:36,524
but had none on the video, wasn't it?

215
00:11:36,524 --> 00:11:37,824
Her hair that she usually had tied back

216
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:40,524
was untied like in her university days!

217
00:11:40,524 --> 00:11:42,724
Talking of her university days,

218
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:44,524
the T-shirt that she bought at the shop

219
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:47,324
that was in the picture that we just saw a while ago

220
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:50,024
Kyoko, in the video was also wearing it.

221
00:11:50,024 --> 00:11:51,824
See, right here!

222
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:54,424
It's hidden with her hand and you can't really see it but,

223
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:56,324
if you enlarge it,

224
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:58,824
you can see the alphabet capital "E" can't you?

225
00:11:58,824 --> 00:12:00,324
True.

226
00:12:00,324 --> 00:12:04,124
Kyoko's corpse was wearing only a plain white T shirt.

227
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:08,624
It's proof that the two were killed by the same perpetrator!

228
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:11,824
But what about Mr. Harawaki's will?

229
00:12:11,824 --> 00:12:14,524
The thing that was written on the will, "Funeral Procession of the Dead"

230
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:18,324
was the subtitle of the movie that Harawaki had thought up

231
00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:20,624
and sealed inside the envelope.

232
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:24,524
You said that only Mr. Harawaki could've written it, right?

233
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:27,324
That's because we didn't realize back then...

234
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:32,824
That the perpetrator used this to look inside the sealed envelope!

235
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:34,624
Toilet paper?

236
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:36,624
How?

237
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:37,924
It's easy.

238
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,024
You put the toilet paper roll against the envelope

239
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:42,924
and look through the hole.

240
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:44,524
Do you want to try?

241
00:12:44,524 --> 00:12:45,524
Okay.

242
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:50,024
You're right!

243
00:12:50,024 --> 00:12:51,824
It's slightly transparent and I can see!

244
00:12:51,824 --> 00:12:53,224
But, how come?

245
00:12:53,224 --> 00:12:55,224
The reflection of light.

246
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:58,324
You can't see through the white envelope

247
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:00,524
because of the reflected light.

248
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:04,924
So if you block off just the right amount of light,

249
00:13:04,924 --> 00:13:07,724
you can see right through the envelope!

250
00:13:07,724 --> 00:13:12,224
Which means that the toilet paper missing during break time was...

251
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,724
Yeah. The perpetrator probably used that time

252
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:17,124
to poison Mr. Harawaki to death,

253
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:18,524
look inside the envelope

254
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:21,324
and wrote his note in the cell phone.

255
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:25,324
But then, where is Harawaki's body?

256
00:13:25,324 --> 00:13:28,124
It's right here in this room!

257
00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:29,224
-What? -What?

258
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:31,824
Inside this wardrobe!

259
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:32,824
What?

260
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:35,624
Just what're you talking about?

261
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:38,124
Only a jacket is inside it

262
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:40,024
and the drawers are empty!

263
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:41,924
Okay then, look closely.

264
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:43,224
First...

265
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,624
You take off the top and bottom drawers.

266
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:49,324
Then, you remove the inside board.

267
00:13:49,324 --> 00:13:51,924
It should be in here.

268
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:57,124
The cart with Mr. Harawaki's body on it.

269
00:13:57,124 --> 00:14:00,024
-No way. -It's just like magic!

270
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:05,824
The trick is the inside board and top drawer of the wardrobe.

271
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:06,924
See.

272
00:14:06,924 --> 00:14:08,524
Just enough is cut out

273
00:14:08,524 --> 00:14:10,524
so that the torso of a human can fit inside. Right?

274
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:12,124
Using this trick,

275
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:17,124
the body of a person can be hidden inside the wardrobe!

276
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:20,324
That's why the beads that went in from the top drawer

277
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:23,324
came out of the bottom drawer.

278
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:27,224
Yeah. They fell through the hole to the bottom drawer.

279
00:14:28,324 --> 00:14:29,924
This is what's called...

280
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:32,524
You can't see what's right under your nose!

281
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:36,024
They say the closer you are to it the more you don't realize it's there!

282
00:14:36,024 --> 00:14:37,924
Right, Heiji?

283
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:39,624
Yeah.

284
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:42,424
Shoots, I was just going to say that.

285
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,924
He always steals my thunder.

286
00:14:44,924 --> 00:14:49,624
But didn't you notice that the first time opened the drawer?

287
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:53,124
I thought the drawer was a bit heavy

288
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:55,624
but the body was on the cart

289
00:14:55,624 --> 00:14:58,424
and the middle board distributed his weight evenly,

290
00:14:58,424 --> 00:15:00,624
so I didn't notice.

291
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:02,924
But even if he were on the cart,

292
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:05,824
if you open the drawer, wouldn't the corpse come out?

293
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:06,924
Look!

294
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:10,524
Neither of the drawers have a board behind it. Right?

295
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:12,924
By setting the middle board in place, you can keep what's inside in place.

296
00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:15,524
A gimmick for keeping the board in place is also here.

297
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:17,524
So even if the drawer were to be pulled out,

298
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:19,324
the board would serve as a stopper

299
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:21,224
and the corpse won't come out.

300
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:25,024
But, we didn't have time to put a trick like that together.

301
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,124
No!

302
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:28,724
The one who made this isn't the perpetrator.

303
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:32,724
Your younger brother made this contraption eight years ago!

304
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,824
What? Joji did?

305
00:15:34,824 --> 00:15:38,524
Then, are you saying that the chief disappeared from this room by...

306
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:39,524
Yeah!

307
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:41,924
He probably used this contraption and hid inside the wardrobe

308
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,224
to make it look like he vanished.

309
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:48,424
Well, there's no mistake that Joji was hiding in the wardrobe.

310
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:52,324
The fact that he was found sitting with his arms around his knees

311
00:15:52,324 --> 00:15:54,924
shows that he got stuck, couldn't come out of the wardrobe

312
00:15:54,924 --> 00:15:57,124
and starved to death.

313
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,024
You mean my brother died

314
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,924
because he couldn't make it out of the wardrobe on his own?

315
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:02,024
No.

316
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:05,024
If he pushed the top drawer out and remove the board that is inside,

317
00:16:05,024 --> 00:16:09,524
I'm sure he could've come out on his own.

318
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:10,824
Then why?

319
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:14,124
Most probably because he couldn't push the drawer out.

320
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:15,624
Hey, wait...

321
00:16:15,624 --> 00:16:19,924
Don't tell me that because we moved the wardrobe of this room

322
00:16:19,924 --> 00:16:23,724
to look for the chief eight years ago,

323
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:26,824
he couldn't push out the drawer and...

324
00:16:26,824 --> 00:16:30,624
Since Mr. Harawaki and Kyoko were killed, then...

325
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:33,524
Don't tell me that the perpetrator is chief's older brother?

326
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:36,024
Oh, no. I...

327
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:38,924
Well, that's one of the reasons why he died.

328
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:40,824
But that's not the problem.

329
00:16:40,824 --> 00:16:44,824
After being trapped in the wardrobe and starved to death,

330
00:16:44,824 --> 00:16:46,324
why was Joji sitting on the floor

331
00:16:46,324 --> 00:16:49,624
when you all came back to look for him again four days later?

332
00:16:49,624 --> 00:16:51,424
Why?

333
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:53,524
Somebody knew.

334
00:16:53,524 --> 00:16:56,424
That Joji was hiding in the wardrobe.

335
00:16:56,424 --> 00:16:57,424
What?

336
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:58,624
Isn't that right?

337
00:16:58,624 --> 00:17:01,224
Actress Ms. Ria Kawabata!

338
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:05,324
You're the one who killed Mr. Harawaki and Ms. Kyoko too!

339
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:10,124
First during break time, you went to Mr. Harawaki's room,

340
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:15,924
conned him into drinking the poisoned water and killed him.

341
00:17:15,924 --> 00:17:19,624
Then you used the roll of toilet paper to read the subtitle

342
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:21,624
before including it in the suicide note.

343
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,324
After that you played the video that was taken eight years ago

344
00:17:24,324 --> 00:17:25,824
using the tablet

345
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:28,124
and recorded it onto his cell phone.

346
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:29,324
After you make the blacked out scene,

347
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:32,524
you made his body hold his cell phone

348
00:17:32,524 --> 00:17:35,924
and finally returned to the place where they were filming.

349
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:37,024
If you stopped there,

350
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:40,924
Mr. Harawaki's death would've been concluded as suicide.

351
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:44,024
However, Kyoko realized what you did.

352
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:47,824
Well, if the whereabouts of the data can be found then,

353
00:17:47,824 --> 00:17:52,024
maybe the mystery of Harawaki's suicide can be solved too.

354
00:17:52,024 --> 00:17:53,224
Because you had no other choice,

355
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:55,924
you wet Kyoko's T-shirt with water or something

356
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:58,824
when you fled to the second floor during the zombie scare

357
00:17:58,824 --> 00:18:01,224
and made her get changed into a plain white T-shirt.

358
00:18:01,224 --> 00:18:02,924
After that you cornered her to the wall

359
00:18:02,924 --> 00:18:05,924
and slashed her neck with a cutter-knife.

360
00:18:05,924 --> 00:18:07,224
In order to make it look exactly like the video

361
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:09,424
that was taken eight years ago.

362
00:18:09,424 --> 00:18:14,024
You recorded the video taken eight years ago on Kyoko's cell phone

363
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:18,824
to make everyone think that Mr. Harawaki turned into a zombie

364
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:22,324
and killed Kyoko then hid his corpse into the wardrobe.

365
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:24,324
Using the contraption of the wardrobe

366
00:18:24,324 --> 00:18:26,524
that you heard about from Joji eight years ago.

367
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:33,124
If we check I'm sure we'll find it on your clothes,

368
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:36,424
the blood that splattered on you when you killed Kyoko.

369
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:40,924
But anybody else besides Ria could've used that trick too.

370
00:18:40,924 --> 00:18:43,224
Ms. Ria, remember what you said?

371
00:18:43,224 --> 00:18:45,724
When I tried to look into the wardrobe,

372
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,724
you asked me to check under the bed, didn't you?

373
00:18:50,124 --> 00:18:52,124
That was because you thought you'd be in trouble

374
00:18:52,124 --> 00:18:54,524
if I looked there since I'm short, right?

375
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:58,624
You thought that the corpse you hid in the drawer would be found, right?

376
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:01,324
Besides, remember what Ms. Orie said?

377
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:02,324
That eight years ago

378
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:06,224
when Ms. Kyoko and you went upstairs to look for Joji,

379
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:09,024
your scream was heard after a while,

380
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:15,024
and Kyoko was standing behind you, who had gone weak in the hips.

381
00:19:15,024 --> 00:19:18,224
Heiji said that's when he figured it out.

382
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,824
This room is right near the stairs,

383
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:24,724
and one of the two of you would've searched the wardrobe first thing,

384
00:19:24,724 --> 00:19:27,124
and yet, Ria's scream was not heard for a while,

385
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,724
so that it's strange.

386
00:19:28,724 --> 00:19:32,124
If Kyoko was standing behind Ria,

387
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:34,424
then he said that it had to be Ria,

388
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,424
who pulled the corpse out of the wardrobe,

389
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:38,524
and pretended to be stunned!

390
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:43,324
Well, it's true that I was stunned.

391
00:19:43,324 --> 00:19:46,824
I thought he had gotten out of the wardrobe long before

392
00:19:46,824 --> 00:19:49,924
and snoring in bed,

393
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:52,624
but was surprised to see him still in there.

394
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,924
So, I quickly pulled him out of the drawer

395
00:19:55,924 --> 00:19:59,324
and scream after I sat him up.

396
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,624
As if I had just found him.

397
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:04,624
But isn't that an accident?

398
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:06,324
Right.

399
00:20:06,324 --> 00:20:09,724
You were asleep in bed with a cold back then.

400
00:20:09,724 --> 00:20:13,524
But Harawaki didn't think so.

401
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:16,324
When we came as the staff for the filming,

402
00:20:16,324 --> 00:20:19,824
it seems that Harawaki found the letters written in blood by the chief

403
00:20:19,824 --> 00:20:24,224
inside the wardrobe that I didn't remove completely.

404
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,624
It's true.

405
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,124
It says, "I'll curse you".

406
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:29,324
There are a whole bunch of stuff written here.

407
00:20:29,324 --> 00:20:31,924
I, myself was surprised.

408
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:35,824
I made him drink the poison because he threatened me to act in the movie

409
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:38,924
if I didn't want him disclosing to everyone that I was a killer.

410
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:41,824
To think that I went as far as to even kill Kyoko

411
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,224
who getting close to revealing the trick.

412
00:20:44,224 --> 00:20:48,924
I'm supposed to be the woman warrior who defeats zombies and yet...

413
00:20:48,924 --> 00:20:52,324
The one who has a rotten heart and turned into a zombie

414
00:20:52,324 --> 00:20:54,524
must be me.

415
00:22:20,624 --> 00:22:23,024
Is this the sound of Hattori's motorbike?

416
00:22:23,024 --> 00:22:26,124
Yep! It seems the road service man just came

417
00:22:26,124 --> 00:22:27,924
and filled the motorbike up with gas.

418
00:22:27,924 --> 00:22:29,824
I guess I'll go see them off then!

419
00:22:29,824 --> 00:22:31,424
Don't!

420
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,724
What?

421
00:22:32,724 --> 00:22:37,324
Heiji said that he had something important to talk to Kazuha about.

422
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,724
Really?

423
00:22:40,724 --> 00:22:42,724
Something important to talk about?

424
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:47,624
Hey, Heiji, what is it?

425
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:50,924
You had something important to tell me, didn't you?

426
00:22:50,924 --> 00:22:55,124
Kazuha. This something that's been on my mind from some time ago.

427
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,324
The thing is...

428
00:23:05,624 --> 00:23:06,724
What?

429
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:09,224
Wasn't today the day for audition?

430
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:11,024
It was yesterday, you idiot!

431
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:13,924
It finished long ago.

432
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:16,424
Everybody, they say that the audition's over!

433
00:23:16,424 --> 00:23:17,524
What?

434
00:23:17,524 --> 00:23:18,724
No joke.

435
00:23:21,724 --> 00:23:24,124
And? What did you want to talk to me about?

436
00:23:24,124 --> 00:23:25,424
Hold your skirt down

437
00:23:25,424 --> 00:23:27,624
so that your panty doesn't show is what I wanted to say.

438
00:23:27,624 --> 00:23:28,924
What? Wait a minute.

439
00:23:30,524 --> 00:23:32,024
Heiji?

440
00:23:32,024 --> 00:23:33,724
I guess the time's not right yet.

441
00:23:37,924 --> 00:23:39,924
Well, at least I gave him back what I owed him.

442
00:23:42,424 --> 00:23:44,724
"Next Episode"

444
00:24:03,524 --> 00:24:04,924
Don't die!

445
00:24:04,924 --> 00:24:06,524
Pops!
