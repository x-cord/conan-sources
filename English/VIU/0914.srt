1
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:04,584
The police cornered jewelry store robber,

2
00:00:04,584 --> 00:00:06,784
"Iwao Takatori (38)" -Iwao Takatori, in a warehouse.

3
00:00:06,784 --> 00:00:08,284
But just as I was beginning to explain my reasoning

4
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:10,884
as the Sleeping Kogoro...

5
00:00:14,084 --> 00:00:15,684
What?

6
00:00:15,684 --> 00:00:16,884
Run!

7
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:34,284
Don't move!

8
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,584
Takatori, stop right...

9
00:00:37,584 --> 00:00:38,684
Conan?

10
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:39,984
Kid?

11
00:00:39,984 --> 00:00:41,084
Stand up.

12
00:00:43,684 --> 00:00:46,184
Don't move!

13
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:48,784
I'll blow the kid's head apart...

14
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:52,984
like a crushed tomato.

15
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:01,184
-Wait! -Takatori!

16
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,084
Conan!

17
00:01:03,084 --> 00:01:07,584
Takatori kidnapped me so I could retrieve the stolen jewels

18
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,984
from the body of Utsumi,

19
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:12,784
the man who betrayed him.

20
00:01:16,884 --> 00:01:19,184
Is this all?

21
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:21,084
Hiding them won't do you any good.

22
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:22,884
I'm not hiding anything.

23
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:25,184
I thought it was strange, too.

24
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:29,584
Didn't you steal 300 million yen worth of jewels?

25
00:01:29,584 --> 00:01:33,084
This clearly isn't enough.

26
00:01:33,084 --> 00:01:34,384
It was him.

27
00:01:35,784 --> 00:01:39,184
He talked him into it.

28
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:41,684
For less than half a share,

29
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,984
he agreed to kill me.

30
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:46,784
Idiot!

31
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:48,884
Who's "he"?

32
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:54,184
Mister, maybe you were betrayed.

33
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:56,484
What are you going to do now?

34
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:59,084
Are you going to...

35
00:02:09,784 --> 00:02:12,384
Your job's over.

36
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:15,984
Keep your curiosity in check.

37
00:02:15,984 --> 00:02:19,584
If you think I won't kill a kid,

38
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:21,184
you're dead wrong.

39
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:35,284
Where?

40
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:37,184
Where are we going?

41
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:47,184
He's slowing down?

42
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:48,684
What's happening?

43
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:51,184
What's he going to do?

44
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:53,984
Want to get out again, kid?

45
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:57,184
If you're lucky, you might be saved.

46
00:03:01,284 --> 00:03:02,284
What?

47
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:09,884
Farewell.

48
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:21,484
When the countdown reaches zero,

49
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:23,984
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

50
00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:28,484
A kidnapping and someone being pushed down a chimney!

51
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:30,584
Where is this case of betrayal headed?

52
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:32,184
He sees through the one and only truth.

53
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:33,984
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

54
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:36,284
His name is Detective Conan!

55
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:20,032
"Conan Kidnapped (Part 2)"

56
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:31,455
What happened to me?

57
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:32,955
Where am I?

58
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:44,495
What?

59
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:46,195
You found Conan?

60
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:47,295
What?

61
00:05:47,295 --> 00:05:49,595
Where is he? Is he all right?

62
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:51,495
"Beika Central Hospital"

63
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,195
A chimney?

64
00:05:54,195 --> 00:06:00,595
Yeah. The body of his accomplice, Utsumi was there.

65
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:02,595
Takatori must've killed him.

66
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,495
No.

67
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:06,495
I don't think so.

68
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:11,195
He probably tried to kill him but failed.

69
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:13,095
Did Takatori tell you that?

70
00:06:13,095 --> 00:06:15,395
I find that hard to believe.

71
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:18,495
But he said someone talked his accomplice

72
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:22,995
into trying to kill him for less than half a share.

73
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:24,295
Someone...

74
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:26,995
Which means there's another accomplice...

75
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:30,295
No, a mastermind.

76
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:32,095
If that's true,

77
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:34,695
then there's more to this case than we thought.

78
00:06:37,195 --> 00:06:41,195
Takagi, find the abandoned factory immediately.

79
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:42,995
Confirm Utsumi's death

80
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:45,795
and search for clues to Takatori's whereabouts.

81
00:06:45,795 --> 00:06:48,095
Chiba, determine who this "someone" is

82
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:50,295
from their mutual acquaintances.

83
00:06:50,295 --> 00:06:51,295
Yes, sir!

84
00:06:55,195 --> 00:06:57,095
Conan!

85
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:58,295
Are you okay?

86
00:06:58,295 --> 00:07:00,095
Ran.

87
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,595
Sorry for making you worry.

88
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:04,495
He's not badly hurt.

89
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:06,695
They're keeping him in the hospital

90
00:07:06,695 --> 00:07:08,395
for a few days for observation.

91
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,095
That's good.

92
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,895
You didn't tell me anything, dad.

93
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,095
Sorry.

94
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:18,095
I thought I'd make sure he was safe first.

95
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:21,395
I know. But I'm really glad

96
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:24,195
that you're all right.

97
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:25,195
Ran...

98
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:29,295
I feel tired.

99
00:07:31,595 --> 00:07:34,095
Well, we should get going.

100
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:35,195
Right.

101
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:38,495
Look after him, Ran.

102
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,995
Got it.

103
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:42,395
Take care.

104
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,095
Conan, is there anything you want?

105
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:49,195
I'm a little thirsty.

106
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:51,195
Then I'll ask a nurse

107
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:54,895
if it's okay for me to buy you a drink.

108
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:57,195
Okay. Sorry.

109
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:58,695
For what?

110
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:00,695
Just take it easy.

111
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:05,795
I'm really sorry, Ran.

112
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:13,695
The only clue I have so far is...

113
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,895
"Shingetsu Bar"

114
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:21,195
I need to stop Takatori soon.

115
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:28,295
In any case, I'd better check it out.

116
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:33,095
What? Conan?

117
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:36,195
You can't be serious.

118
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:38,095
What?

119
00:08:38,095 --> 00:08:40,595
Conan is missing again?

120
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:42,595
What should we do, dad?

121
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:45,195
What if he's in danger again?

122
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:47,995
Find him and bring him back, dad.

123
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,295
Gosh.

124
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:54,095
That busybody's always causing headaches.

125
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:56,395
Did something happen to Conan?

126
00:08:56,395 --> 00:08:58,195
You won't believe what happened.

127
00:08:59,395 --> 00:09:00,495
Please.

128
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:03,095
Please help me look for him.

129
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:04,895
Got it.

130
00:09:09,895 --> 00:09:13,495
Takatori's goals are most likely acquiring his share,

131
00:09:13,495 --> 00:09:17,995
and getting revenge on someone who betrayed him.

132
00:09:17,995 --> 00:09:21,395
He talked him into it.

133
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,795
For less than half a share,

134
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:27,095
he agreed to kill me.

135
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:29,195
Idiot!

136
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:30,795
I'll stop him.

137
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:43,095
Stop the car.

138
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:52,495
"Shingetsu Bar"

139
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:53,995
"Genji"

140
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:55,095
This is it.

141
00:10:01,295 --> 00:10:02,495
"Shingetsu Bar"

142
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:04,995
"Genji"

143
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:05,995
That's it.

144
00:10:10,595 --> 00:10:11,895
It won't open.

145
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:16,495
"Utsumi"

146
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:17,695
Is this...

147
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:19,295
"Tokuro Utsumi (32)"

148
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:23,595
It's that man's apartment.

149
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:33,295
There's no mistaking it.

150
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:34,995
The body inside the chimney

151
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:37,695
belongs to Takatori's accomplice, Utsumi.

152
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:42,695
However, we haven't found any clues to Takatori's location.

153
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:44,995
Chiba is currently

154
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:46,595
looking into Utsumi's personal life.

155
00:10:53,995 --> 00:10:55,995
This place is awful.

156
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:06,795
It's not that old.

157
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:22,895
This man...

158
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:24,895
"Jewelry Shop Shimazu" -He worked at the jewelry shop...

159
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:26,395
"Buyer, Setsuo Yamaga" -Takatori robbed.

160
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,095
What's this?

161
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:41,195
Utsumi, Takatori, and Yamaga.

162
00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:43,695
Who's the last person?

163
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:49,095
But I'm starting to see what's really going on.

164
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,395
What's that?

165
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:01,795
What's this?

166
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:05,695
Today at 4:00 pm, HK.

167
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:07,395
Hong Kong?

168
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:08,995
And it's at 4:00 pm.

169
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:12,595
I've got an hour and a half.

170
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:27,595
What?

171
00:12:27,595 --> 00:12:28,695
Takatori?

172
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:31,795
Gosh.

173
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:35,195
You're quite the mischievous boy, kid.

174
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:37,195
Did you kill him?

175
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:43,195
I can see why you'd think that.

176
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:47,595
But he's not the one who betrayed me.

177
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:50,795
Then is the fourth man that "someone"?

178
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:02,695
Mister, wait!

179
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:04,595
Open the door!

180
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:06,695
In that case...

181
00:13:06,695 --> 00:13:08,095
Oh, no.

182
00:13:08,095 --> 00:13:10,595
Darn it. What should I do?

183
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:18,808
I've determined Utsumi's address.

184
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:20,408
I'm on my way there now.

185
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,708
What?

186
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,408
Where did you come from?

187
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:39,808
Lucky me.

188
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:51,308
Taxi!

189
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:54,108
Drive, please.

190
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,508
Mouri speaking.

191
00:14:06,508 --> 00:14:08,008
Mister, where are you?

192
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:09,608
Conan?

193
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:13,508
Chiba?

194
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:14,708
What?

195
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:18,208
You found Yamaga's body at Utsumi's apartment?

196
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,408
What?

197
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:20,708
Don't be ridiculous, Conan.

198
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,208
Where are you?

199
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,308
Hong Kong?

200
00:14:23,308 --> 00:14:24,508
What?

201
00:14:24,508 --> 00:14:27,008
Yes. HK...

202
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:30,208
We believe he's getting on the 4:00 pm flight to Hong Kong.

203
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,108
I see. A plane.

204
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:36,508
Conan, are you on your way to the airport?

205
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,608
I am. Hurry, Pops.

206
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,708
Thank you.

207
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,708
I appreciate the help.

208
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,608
Everyone head to the airport immediately!

209
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:49,808
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

210
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:20,208
So you've already exchanged the jewels for cash

211
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,908
and are off to an elegant overseas vacation.

212
00:15:22,908 --> 00:15:26,508
You've forgotten my share.

213
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:30,408
And the fee you owe Utsumi for hiring him to kill me!

214
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:41,608
Darn!

215
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,908
Will I make it in time?

216
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:46,508
Too scared to talk?

217
00:15:54,908 --> 00:15:56,608
Go to the underworld!

218
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,208
That's it.

219
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,508
Go!

220
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:30,108
Mister, get down!

221
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,608
Now we're even.

222
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:48,808
You said you'd kill a child,

223
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:53,608
but you threw me into the median.

224
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:55,708
It wasn't a coincidence, was it?

225
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,108
You even slowed down.

226
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:04,808
Who are you?

227
00:17:04,808 --> 00:17:07,608
Conan Edogawa.

228
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:09,008
I'm a detective.

229
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:15,208
You're a sharp kid.

230
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,308
Takatori.

231
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:19,908
You can't escape this time.

232
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:22,108
Inspector.

233
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,608
On the ground behind you is the robbery accomplice

234
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:28,408
and suspect wanted for murder and attempted murder.

235
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:33,708
Takatori's "someone" and jewelry store owner.

236
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,608
Arrest Teruaki Shimazu!

237
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,608
What was that?

238
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:44,008
What do you mean, Mouri?

239
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:47,008
I thought Takatori killed his accomplice Utsumi

240
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:52,908
and the buyer Yamaga who leaked the information.

241
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:54,008
No.

242
00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:57,708
Utsumi died accidentally when he fell from the chimney

243
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,808
while trying to kill Takatori.

244
00:18:00,808 --> 00:18:03,708
And Yamaga was killed

245
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:08,008
by none other than Teruaki Shimazu.

246
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:09,608
This is ridiculous.

247
00:18:09,608 --> 00:18:12,508
What proof do you have?

248
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,808
He was trying to kill me.

249
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:16,508
I was defending myself.

250
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:18,608
What?

251
00:18:18,608 --> 00:18:22,208
Mister, you smell like noodles soup.

252
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:26,808
Did you eat noodles soup somewhere? Or...

253
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:29,508
There were footprints at Utsumi's apartment

254
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:33,408
in the broth of a spilled instant noodles cup.

255
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:37,108
But the victim Utsumi's socks were clean.

256
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:38,508
That's right.

257
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:44,008
Which means it was...

258
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:47,008
Shimazu, could you please take off your socks

259
00:18:47,008 --> 00:18:51,008
so we can check them?

260
00:18:51,008 --> 00:18:52,408
I refuse to accept this.

261
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:55,908
Why would I steal jewels from my own jewelry store?

262
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:57,108
Because...

263
00:18:57,108 --> 00:19:02,308
Because you insured the valuable jewels.

264
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,408
It'd be easy enough to figure out.

265
00:19:04,408 --> 00:19:10,608
That and the jewelry store's circumstances that required it.

266
00:19:13,408 --> 00:19:17,808
Yamaga wasn't so much an accomplice

267
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:20,308
as he was forced to cooperate with your orders,

268
00:19:20,308 --> 00:19:22,908
without realizing he'd be framed

269
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:27,808
for leaking information and murdered.

270
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:29,708
You probably enticed him

271
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:36,208
by saying he could join you and Utsumi in Hong Kong.

272
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,508
-Cheers! -Cheers!

273
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,708
I'm impressed you noticed, Conan.

274
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:17,108
The cup noodles were just like someone else's crepe.

275
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:18,608
What?

276
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:24,708
Pops told me about his reasoning that was interrupted.

277
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:30,108
The Sleeping Kogoro.

278
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:32,208
One more thing,

279
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,808
even though you always wore masks,

280
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:35,608
there was a incriminating piece of evidence

281
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:37,708
captured by the cameras.

282
00:20:49,308 --> 00:20:51,208
So that's what it was.

283
00:20:57,308 --> 00:21:01,008
You're the great detective's assistant.

284
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:09,708
Actually, it's the other way around.

285
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,708
Well done, Mouri!

286
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:16,108
You finished your explanation that was interrupted.

287
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,308
You've redeemed yourself.

288
00:21:19,308 --> 00:21:23,608
This isn't good.

289
00:22:50,108 --> 00:22:55,708
Something feels different this time.

290
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,508
Maybe you're hungover.

291
00:22:57,508 --> 00:23:01,308
You're right. I did have too much to drink yesterday.

292
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:03,308
Just yesterday?

293
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:06,108
Oh, almost forgot.

294
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:07,108
Here.

295
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:10,908
Thank you.

296
00:23:10,908 --> 00:23:12,808
Call Ran.

297
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,608
She's worried about you.

298
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:17,208
Right.

"Ran Mouri"

300
00:23:23,808 --> 00:23:25,608
Ran?

301
00:23:25,608 --> 00:23:27,008
Conan?

302
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:30,208
Where have you been? What have you been doing?

303
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,508
You'd better come straight home this time!

304
00:23:32,508 --> 00:23:33,808
We need to talk!

305
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:41,208
Ran, I'm really sorry.

306
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:45,108
"Next Episode"

307
00:23:45,108 --> 00:23:46,408
Sorry.

308
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:50,208
Does this look like the arm you saw?

309
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,908
The same flowerbeds are on the roof.

310
00:23:52,908 --> 00:23:55,108
If what I saw was on the roof,

311
00:23:55,108 --> 00:23:57,608
then the body's buried up there.

312
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:59,508
There's one logical conclusion.

313
00:23:59,508 --> 00:24:02,208
The culprit couldn't dispose of it.

314
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,308
In other words,

315
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,608
the body should still be hidden in this building!

316
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:08,508
Next Conan,

317
00:24:08,508 --> 00:24:12,608
"High School Girl Detective Sonoko Suzuki"
