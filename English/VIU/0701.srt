1
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:09,923
Mystery train?

2
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:12,023
The Bell Tree Express?

3
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:14,623
It's unthinkable that Sherry would ever ride

4
00:00:14,623 --> 00:00:16,223
such a flashy idiotic train like that, though.

5
00:00:16,223 --> 00:00:20,323
Oh, maybe that's the very reason why she chose it, right?

6
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:22,723
The compartments in that train are all single and private.

7
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,523
I don't think that there's a more suitable way to divert

8
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:26,123
the Organization's eyes

9
00:00:26,123 --> 00:00:29,023
and flee from the Kanto district, don't you?

10
00:00:29,023 --> 00:00:31,523
But, it really is hard to believe

11
00:00:31,523 --> 00:00:33,423
that Sherry was living in hiding in

12
00:00:33,423 --> 00:00:35,623
-a remote mountain area in Gunma. -Yes.

13
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:37,623
Bourbon who got that information

14
00:00:37,623 --> 00:00:39,123
also feels the same.

15
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:42,423
Because she just happened to tell a third party

16
00:00:42,423 --> 00:00:44,223
that she coincidentally ran into about it,

17
00:00:44,223 --> 00:00:46,523
so it may not be too reliable.

18
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:49,523
But, if Sherry were to be on that train,

19
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:52,223
wouldn't it make a great hunting ground?

20
00:00:52,223 --> 00:00:53,223
Yeah.

21
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:57,523
If we can only keep her from getting off part way.

22
00:00:57,523 --> 00:00:58,923
It's a moving steel prison.

23
00:00:58,923 --> 00:01:00,823
We can corner her with terror as if hunting down deer,

24
00:01:00,823 --> 00:01:02,723
then, I'm sure she'll expose herself from her side

25
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:04,323
before the gun.

26
00:01:04,323 --> 00:01:06,823
I hope you understand why I went out of the way

27
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:09,223
to leak this information to you?

28
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:10,823
You don't want me to do anything

29
00:01:10,823 --> 00:01:14,123
until the iron snake returns to its nest, right?

30
00:01:14,123 --> 00:01:17,523
Well, I'm sure happy to hear about Sherry from your side,

31
00:01:17,523 --> 00:01:19,423
after such a long time

32
00:01:19,423 --> 00:01:21,923
I was worried maybe you two were getting into some girl talk

33
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:24,923
and you were showing mercy for her or something so...

34
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:29,323
How stupid. Just who do you think I am?

35
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,823
At any rate,

36
00:01:31,823 --> 00:01:34,623
I'll contact you again after the hunt is over.

37
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:36,323
Yeah.

38
00:01:37,823 --> 00:01:39,223
Okay.

39
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:42,323
You win.

40
00:01:42,323 --> 00:01:45,423
I'll forget about Sherry.

41
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:50,323
But...

42
00:01:51,923 --> 00:01:54,623
I'm not the one who's going to do it,

43
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:56,723
Bourbon is.

44
00:01:58,323 --> 00:01:59,923
She's one person

45
00:01:59,923 --> 00:02:03,023
that shouldn't be on this planet.

46
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,323
No offense.

47
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:08,423
Silver Bullet.

48
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,223
Aim for a 100% solution.

49
00:02:13,223 --> 00:02:15,523
Clear all mysteries and codes.

50
00:02:15,523 --> 00:02:17,323
The shadow of the Organization closes in on Haibara.

51
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:19,323
The departure bell echoes throughout.

52
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:20,723
He sees through the one and only truth.

53
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,823
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

54
00:02:22,823 --> 00:02:25,823
His name is Detective Conan!

55
00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:11,083
"Pitch Black Mystery Express Train (Departure)"

56
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,070
"Tokyo Station"

57
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,370
Fantastic!

58
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,770
This is the first time I've seem a locomotive!

59
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,070
Me too!

60
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,170
It sure is magnificent!

61
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,770
Well, it just looks to be a steam locomotive on the outside.

62
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,270
The inside looks to be

63
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,870
a state-of-the-art diesel locomotive, though.

64
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,770
Ai, you still have a cold?

65
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,770
Yes.

66
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,670
You know whose virus is so persistent, you see.

67
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,570
If so, you should've stayed in bed at home.

68
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,470
Hey, you kids!

69
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,370
You'd better be grateful to the owner

70
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,270
of the Bell Tree Express, the Suzuki Financial Group!

71
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,770
I specially reserved seats for you guys, get that?

72
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,470
Yes, Ma'am!

73
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,870
Well, unlike you guys,

74
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,470
we're sitting in a sparkling first class car, though.

75
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,970
Come to think of it, it's the first class car, isn't it?

76
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,470
That Kid said that he be coming after next time, right?

77
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,170
That's right!

78
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,770
This train usually only runs once a year,

79
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,870
but when Uncle Jirokichi announced that

80
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,870
he would specially run it and display a gem

81
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,170
called whatever,

82
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,570
Kid got super interested and...

83
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,570
That's why I decided to

84
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,870
get on board beforehand this time,

85
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,570
write him a love letter

86
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,170
and hide it in the train. What do you think?

87
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,370
I wonder.

88
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,170
I don't think that Kid would have the time

89
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,870
to get the letter though.

90
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,470
Rather, Kyogoku will get angry at you, you know.

91
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,170
My love for Kid is a different story.

92
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,870
More than a thief like him, I'm more concerned

93
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,970
about the deduction quiz that

94
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,370
they always have in the train!

95
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,370
Sera? What brings you here?

96
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,570
You're here?

97
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,470
I'm a detective! It's only natural for me to be on board.

98
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,370
Isn't your Daddy with you?

99
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,870
Huh? He was here till just a while ago.

100
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,170
Well, if it isn't you, Mr. Ando... Long time no see.

101
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,870
Shall I take your bags for you?

102
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,970
No, thank you.

103
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,970
It's an important thing that

104
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,570
a client asked me to carry for him,

105
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,670
and, it's pretty heavy too.

106
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,670
Well, the only thing that's heavy

107
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,670
is the genuine gold frame though.

108
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,170
The artwork itself is fake.

109
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,470
Since it has already been appraised,

110
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,470
I'm taking it to a client in Nagoya.

111
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,070
Huh? This is a mystery train that's headed for

112
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,770
an unknown destination, you know?

113
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,670
Why are you sure it'll go to Nagoya?

114
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,770
Hey.

115
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,870
Conductor, how many years have you known us already?

116
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,670
If we check which train has a change

117
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,670
in time schedule today,

118
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,670
it wouldn't be difficult to figure it out, no?

119
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,970
Oh.

120
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,170
The target of our intellectual excitement

121
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,570
lies only in the mystery that occurs on board this train.

122
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,370
Isn't that right, Ms. Sumitomo?

123
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,470
Yes, Ma'am.

124
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,570
Just as would be expected of all you, mystery lovers.

125
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,770
I'm sorry to have under estimated you.

126
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,470
Hey, you!

127
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,570
What on earth's going on?

128
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,370
I reserved the same room as I always do,

129
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,470
in the 8th car

130
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,570
where the first class rooms are,

131
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,570
but why has my room been changed to the 7th car?

132
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,370
I'm very sorry.

133
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,770
We already informed you of that the other day.

134
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,270
Due to careless oversight on our part,

135
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,370
there's been an overbooking.

136
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,970
Therefore, we had no choice

137
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,470
but to change your room.

138
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,170
That room's been a favorite of mine

139
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,570
and I've been reserving it every year

140
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,170
since tickets have first been issued.

141
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,670
Who the heck came in between and took the room?

142
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,870
It's me over here.

143
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,370
Well, I'm so very sorry.

144
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,770
My daughter happens to be friends with the owner of this train.

145
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,370
Well, no need for worry since I am on board.

146
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,970
No matter what may happen on this train...

147
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,170
I, the renown detective, Poirot Mouri

148
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,570
will solve the case in the wink of an eye.

149
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,770
Hey, Dad! Just what do you think you're doing!

150
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,470
Nothing, I was just introducing myself

151
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,870
to the people that are staying in car 8 with me.

152
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,770
It's no smoking here.

153
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,070
What's with you? Calling yourself "Poirot"?

154
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,070
You're Kogoro Mouri, aren't you, Dad?

155
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,370
-Oh, you heard me? -Come on!

156
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,770
Everybody's waiting for you in front of car 6

157
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,370
to take pictures together, before the train starts off.

158
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,770
Oh, is that right?

159
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,170
What's this tense atmosphere all about?

160
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,570
Is it because they all found out that Pops is a detective?

161
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,170
Or...

162
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,470
Wow! That's awesome!

163
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,770
It's passing all the stations!

164
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,870
I hear that this train virtually won't stop

165
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,670
until it reaches its destination.

166
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,270
No joke!

167
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,370
Well, it's a mystery where the final destination is, though.

168
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,470
It's Nagoya.

169
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,470
If you check the service status on the web,

170
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,570
you can more or less make out the service planning diagram.

171
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,570
What a boring thing to say when after all,

172
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,170
we're all on board a mystery train.

173
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,470
More than that, what bothers me is,

174
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,870
the deduction quiz that is given out

175
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,070
during the time this train is running.

176
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,670
Rumor has it that the culprit and victim

177
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,070
will be picked out at random

178
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,570
from among the passengers of the train,

179
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,970
and an incident occurs.

180
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,370
All the other remaining passengers become detectives,

181
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,970
and by the time the train reaches its final destination,

182
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,370
it seems that the culprit has to be disclosed.

183
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,770
Yes! What is it?

184
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,870
Huh?

185
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,570
No one's here.

186
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,170
Huh? A letter?

187
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,170
Congratulations.

188
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,470
You've been chosen to play the role of the detective!

189
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,070
An incident will occur

190
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,070
in room B of car 7 in 10 minutes

191
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,370
so go and investigate.

192
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,470
Aren't all the passengers supposed to be detectives?

193
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,770
Room B of car 7...

194
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,070
Here it is! It's this room!

195
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,670
Excuse me.

196
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,170
I'm coming in.

197
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,570
Idiot! Don't come in!

198
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,270
Wow, looks real!

199
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,270
-Let's go after him. -Aye!

200
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,570
Come on, Conan and Ai too!

201
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,170
Rather than being a mystery...

202
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,670
This is just a game of tag.

203
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,470
Darn, we've lost track.

204
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,070
It's full of private rooms,

205
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,370
so it's hard to find him once he goes into a room.

206
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,570
Children?

207
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,270
Is this the first time you've all boarded this train?

208
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,270
Yes.

209
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,770
Then, I think you should stay in your room.

210
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,570
Because the deduction quiz for this time

211
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,770
will be announced from the speaker in your room.

212
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,670
Huh? Hasn't the incident or anything happened yet?

213
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,770
No.

214
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,470
I think it'll be in an hour or so this time.

215
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,770
Then, don't tell me that what happened a while ago is...

216
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,470
Hey, Conan?

217
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,870
Please wait!

218
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,970
-Ai, come on! -Okay.

219
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,770
Ai?

220
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,970
Come on, Ai, let's go.

221
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,970
It can't be...

222
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,570
Oh, Conan, what's the matter?

223
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,270
At least knock when you enter a lady's room!

224
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,270
Oh, no...

225
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,370
This is car number 7, right?

226
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,370
Just what are you talking about? This is car number 8!

227
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,770
I just came over a while ago!

228
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:28,470
Strange. I don't think I miscounted the cars and yet...

229
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,970
It can't be helped.

230
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,970
Because the car numbers

231
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,870
are written only on the body of the train,

232
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,370
and moreover, the only thing written on the door

233
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,670
of the rooms is one letter of the alphabet.

234
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,470
How'd you do on the deduction quiz?

235
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,670
Doc. Is that room, our room in car number 6?

236
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,070
Huh? Yeah. See.

237
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,470
The snacks that you've all been eating till a while ago,

238
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,670
are still there too.

239
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,270
Hey, Conan.

240
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,670
Something's strange?

241
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,870
We only moved one car from car number 8 and yet...

242
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,870
Car number 7...

243
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,570
You mean, car number 7...

244
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,470
disappeared while the train was running?

245
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:19,446
Car number 7 disappeared?

246
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:20,546
That's ridiculous.

247
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:22,446
It was in car number 7 a while ago,

248
00:13:22,446 --> 00:13:24,446
where the man who was shot was.

249
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:27,946
And we went after the culprit who shot the man,

250
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:30,946
but lost track of him.

251
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:34,046
When we returned to car number 7 where the passenger was shot,

252
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,846
it happened to be car number 8!

253
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:38,146
Shot?

254
00:13:38,146 --> 00:13:42,546
Then why didn't you tell us conductors about it right away?

255
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:45,846
We thought that it was the deduction quiz back then!

256
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:47,946
At any rate, please confirm!

257
00:13:47,946 --> 00:13:49,946
Because car number 7 disappeared

258
00:13:49,946 --> 00:13:52,146
along with the passenger who was shot!

259
00:13:52,146 --> 00:13:56,246
If so, it's best to ask the conductors who are in each car.

260
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:58,246
They are seated like I am,

261
00:13:58,246 --> 00:14:01,246
at the rear end of the corridor of the passengers' room.

262
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:04,946
Well, I'm sure that you're mistaken, though.

263
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:07,146
Because of the intention of the owner of this train,

264
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,546
the car numbers aren't displayed

265
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:10,046
on the inside of the train, so...

266
00:14:10,046 --> 00:14:12,246
The owner's intention?

267
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:15,446
Because of this, many passengers

268
00:14:15,446 --> 00:14:18,146
who lose track of where their rooms are,

269
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:21,446
keep us conductors really busy.

270
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:25,846
Excuse me. May I help you?

271
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:27,346
So, when the bell is rung

272
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:28,946
and the light of the room turns on,

273
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:30,846
the conductor comes to the room!

274
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:33,846
Wow! I'm going to give it a try later on too!

275
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:36,046
Right now, our priority is to find car number 7 that disappeared!

276
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:38,846
-Let's go confirm! -Aye!

277
00:14:42,746 --> 00:14:45,646
Ai, are you feeling bad because of your cold?

278
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:49,046
I'm fine because I drank medicine.

279
00:14:49,046 --> 00:14:51,046
Okay, let's go then!

280
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:57,946
That man just now resembled that person.

281
00:14:57,946 --> 00:15:00,146
But, that burn...

282
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:01,746
what's going on?

283
00:15:03,546 --> 00:15:05,146
Car number 7?

284
00:15:05,146 --> 00:15:07,046
Is this really car number 7?

285
00:15:07,046 --> 00:15:08,346
Yeah.

286
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:11,546
Car number 7 has returned!

287
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:12,846
But, how?

288
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:16,146
Let's go back to room B once more then.

289
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:17,846
Yeah.

290
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:24,446
I'm going to open the door.

291
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:27,546
Huh?

292
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:30,246
You know what...

293
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:31,546
Is this really...

294
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:33,946
I said it's car number 8, didn't I?

295
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:37,946
Go back to your room brat, and stay there!

296
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:39,446
Just what is going on...

297
00:15:39,446 --> 00:15:42,246
I wonder if that conductor's making a mistake.

298
00:15:42,246 --> 00:15:46,146
Could be... He kind of looked sleepy too, so, you know.

299
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,346
Wait a sec...

300
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:50,246
If I remember correctly, at first...

301
00:15:57,646 --> 00:15:59,246
That's...

302
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:03,546
Hey, you.

303
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,546
You know, this room...

304
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:10,346
is really actually room B of car number 7.

305
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:11,446
Right?

306
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:13,346
Like I've been trying to tell you...

307
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:16,746
You received it too, didn't you, Sonoko?

308
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:18,946
A card that looks like this.

309
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:22,246
And you did as was instructed on the card, right?

310
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:24,546
It told you to change rooms temporarily

311
00:16:24,546 --> 00:16:26,646
with the person playing the role of the victim

312
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:30,446
in order to confuse the detectives that came to this room.

313
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:32,446
Am I wrong?

314
00:16:32,446 --> 00:16:34,846
Wow! Just as would be expected of you, Conan!

315
00:16:34,846 --> 00:16:36,346
Correct!

316
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:39,346
Somebody knocked on the door, and when I opened it,

317
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:41,146
an envelope was on the floor.

318
00:16:41,146 --> 00:16:44,146
This is what was written on the card.

319
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:48,346
"Congratulations, you've been chosen as the accomplice!"

320
00:16:48,346 --> 00:16:50,646
The rest is just as you said, Conan.

321
00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:52,046
We were instructed to liven up the deduction quiz

322
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:54,546
by switching rooms with the person playing

323
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,846
the role of the victim in room B of car number 7!

324
00:16:57,846 --> 00:17:00,446
Angry at me for being correct, eh.

325
00:17:00,446 --> 00:17:02,846
And, I happened to pass by

326
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:04,946
just when the person playing the role of the victim

327
00:17:04,946 --> 00:17:08,946
was switching rooms with them, so I joined them!

328
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:11,546
So, I'm sure the person playing the role of the victim

329
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:14,146
is relaxing in car number 8 now.

330
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:16,046
Then, where's Pops?

331
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:18,246
He went to the dining room after being told to do so,

332
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,546
by the person playing the victim!

333
00:17:20,546 --> 00:17:22,346
The dining room?

334
00:17:22,346 --> 00:17:24,046
He was told to wait in the dining room

335
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:27,046
because they wanted him to play the role of the detective

336
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,446
that would act as commentator of this deduction quiz at the end.

337
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:30,846
Oh...

338
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:32,246
That's that.

339
00:17:32,246 --> 00:17:34,046
But, I guess it's nice to meet you, for the first time, isn't it?

340
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:35,446
Huh?

341
00:17:35,446 --> 00:17:37,646
It's you, isn't it? The one called Haibara?

342
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:39,146
Oh, yeah.

343
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:43,446
I wanted to talk to you from before.

344
00:17:43,446 --> 00:17:45,946
This person...

345
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:48,146
Don't tell me that...

346
00:17:48,146 --> 00:17:49,646
It can't be.

347
00:17:49,646 --> 00:17:51,046
Who is it?

348
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:55,446
What?

349
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:59,146
I thought somebody was peeking through the door just now.

350
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:01,446
I guess not.

351
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:13,046
The food and the wine are exquisite.

352
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:19,946
Fire burning in the field?

353
00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:39,146
You solved the mystery of the missing corpse?

354
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:44,146
The deduction quiz this time has not been announced yet.

355
00:18:44,146 --> 00:18:46,646
But, I got a card like this!

356
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:48,246
We did too.

357
00:18:48,246 --> 00:18:50,046
Let me see.

358
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:53,246
It looks to be the same as the instruction card

359
00:18:53,246 --> 00:18:55,946
that is usually given out but...

360
00:18:55,946 --> 00:19:00,546
what I was told this time was not this sort of trick.

361
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:02,946
What on earth is going on?

362
00:19:02,946 --> 00:19:05,046
I guess we have no choice but to go to the room

363
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:06,646
of the person playing the role of the victim,

364
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,246
who's in car number 8 and ask him!

365
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:10,246
Before that, I got to go to the restroom!

366
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:12,846
I've got to go too!

367
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,546
What's up, Haibara?

368
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:20,046
This train... don't you feel a strange presence?

369
00:19:20,046 --> 00:19:21,946
A murderous-like atmosphere.

370
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:26,546
Well, that's because you've read too many Christie novels.

371
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:28,846
That presence

372
00:19:28,846 --> 00:19:31,446
doesn't feel to be just one or two people.

373
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:39,446
Mr. Noto, may I help you?

374
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:42,746
Mr. Noto! Mr. Noto?

375
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:45,746
What is it? I didn't call you!

376
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:47,246
Huh?

377
00:19:47,246 --> 00:19:49,546
But the bell just rung.

378
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:51,046
Beats me.

379
00:19:51,046 --> 00:19:53,246
I tell you. You don't come when I call

380
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:55,546
and yet you come when I don't need you.

381
00:19:55,546 --> 00:19:57,346
Oh, I'm so very sorry.

382
00:19:57,346 --> 00:19:59,646
Oh, I'm fine.

383
00:19:59,646 --> 00:20:01,546
There seems to have been some trouble next door,

384
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:04,346
but it seems to have been a mistake.

385
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:07,046
All right.

386
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:09,146
Oh, yes.

387
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:16,846
Ms. Idenami.

388
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:19,246
Hey, do something about it, will you?

389
00:20:19,246 --> 00:20:21,146
Do what?

390
00:20:21,146 --> 00:20:25,246
The sound... I hear strange noises in my room!

391
00:20:25,246 --> 00:20:27,746
Oh.

392
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:30,146
I don't hear anything.

393
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,146
I heard it a while ago!

394
00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:34,746
Are you implicating that I'm lying?

395
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:37,346
No, I'd do no such thing.

396
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:42,246
See, it's this sound. You hear it, don't you?

397
00:20:42,246 --> 00:20:44,346
Yes, ma'am. I think it's probably

398
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:47,546
a cell phone or the like that someone forgot.

399
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,946
Hey, don't come in! I'll look for it myself!

400
00:20:50,946 --> 00:20:52,746
Oh.

401
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:54,646
What I really want to say is,

402
00:20:54,646 --> 00:20:58,446
why you didn't find that cell phone before the train started off!

403
00:20:58,446 --> 00:21:01,046
I'm very sorry.

404
00:21:01,046 --> 00:21:04,046
What's up?

405
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:06,946
Over here! This is our room.

406
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:09,046
Hey, sir,

407
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:11,346
the trick's already been figured out.

408
00:21:11,346 --> 00:21:14,446
Come out and explain it, will you?

409
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:18,746
Don't tell me he fell asleep in our room.

410
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,246
No joke!

411
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:25,046
Sir! Get up and unlock the chain, will you?

412
00:21:25,046 --> 00:21:26,446
Hey, sir!

413
00:21:26,446 --> 00:21:27,546
What's the matter?

414
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:30,346
He seems to be napping on the sofa.

415
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:35,146
He's bleeding from the temple, as if he's dead.

416
00:21:35,146 --> 00:21:38,046
I'll bet it's just another part of the deduction quiz?

417
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,146
Move it, will you?

418
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:45,746
-The smell of... -Gun powder.

419
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,646
Let's break the door down!

420
00:21:48,946 --> 00:21:51,246
Ready, get set, go!

421
00:21:59,146 --> 00:22:00,646
Wow!

422
00:22:00,646 --> 00:22:02,946
Another deduction quiz?

423
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,846
No.

424
00:22:04,846 --> 00:22:06,346
He's really dead.

425
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:07,946
Huh?

426
00:22:12,746 --> 00:22:14,646
Moreover, this is...

427
00:22:15,946 --> 00:22:18,146
A locked door murder.

428
00:23:43,746 --> 00:23:47,246
I shall splendidly see through the truth

429
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:50,046
of this Bell Tree Express murder and solve the case!

430
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:53,746
I just got word from Vermouth.

431
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:57,546
She says she confirmed that Sherry's on the train.

432
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:59,046
What shall I do?

433
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:01,946
If the Organization is really after me

434
00:24:01,946 --> 00:24:04,546
and is on board this train...

435
00:24:04,546 --> 00:24:06,846
I don't stand a chance.

436
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,646
Next Conan,

437
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:12,846
"Pitch Black Mystery Express Train (Tunnel)"

438
00:24:28,746 --> 00:24:30,746
Next Conan's Hint:

439
00:24:30,746 --> 00:24:32,546
"Conductor's Testimony"

440
00:24:32,546 --> 00:24:33,746
-Locked room. -Building blocks.

441
00:24:33,746 --> 00:24:34,846
-Hot air balloon. -Eel.

442
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:35,946
-Scrutiny. -Locked room.

443
00:24:35,946 --> 00:24:37,846
I'm locked in and can't stop the round.
