1
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:03,182
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,183 --> 00:00:04,882
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,883 --> 00:00:06,482
Officer of police headquarters and the detective squad.

4
00:00:06,483 --> 00:00:08,682
Love and mystery is on the verge of explosion.

5
00:00:08,683 --> 00:00:10,282
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,283 --> 00:00:12,282
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,283 --> 00:00:14,583
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:11,154
Hey! Isn't that Hide?

9
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:13,454
Where? I can't see!

10
00:02:13,455 --> 00:02:18,054
No! They said on radio just a while ago

11
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,354
that Hide is going to be riding the car at the end of the line!

12
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:22,054
Is that right?

13
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:25,754
It sure is unusual to have a soccer victory parade though.

14
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:27,554
It can't be helped.

15
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:29,454
Every year a big fuss is made

16
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:31,654
over the Tokyo Spirits being the winning candidate,

17
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:33,154
and finally this year

18
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:35,454
they won the J1 championship for the first time!

19
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:39,754
Moreover, they won by a dramatic come-from-behind victory.

20
00:02:39,755 --> 00:02:40,755
Right!

21
00:02:40,756 --> 00:02:43,354
In the second half lost time they were losing 1 to 0,

22
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:45,254
but Hide tied the game!

23
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:48,354
And then right after the playoffs, Naoki scored a V goal!

24
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:50,754
He was awesome!

25
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,454
But with all this crowd,

26
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:54,454
we can't really see the parade.

27
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:55,554
Right.

28
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:57,954
I even brought along my video camera.

29
00:02:57,955 --> 00:02:59,254
It's so disappointing.

30
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:01,054
That's why I told you, right?

31
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,354
We should've kept watching TV like we were!

32
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:05,554
Come...

33
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:07,954
We set the video recorder before coming here,

34
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:11,154
so we can all watch it together later!

35
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:12,954
Hey! Maybe if we go there,

36
00:03:12,955 --> 00:03:14,555
we can have a better view!

37
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:17,554
There! Over there!

38
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:18,654
I see!

39
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:19,954
If you go on top the empty cans container,

40
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:21,054
we may get a better view!

41
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:22,955
-Let's go! -Okay!

42
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,654
How is it?

43
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:29,054
Can you see?

44
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:30,854
Wait a second...

45
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:33,454
I can see glimpses of their heads

46
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,455
but not their faces.

47
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:39,054
It hurts...

48
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:41,954
Hey...

49
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,054
Darn it.

50
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:45,854
If it was only a bit higher!

51
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:47,554
But I don't see anything

52
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:49,254
that is higher than this empty cans container.

53
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:51,055
Neither do I...

54
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:55,554
-That's it! -That's it!

55
00:03:55,555 --> 00:03:57,855
Hey...

56
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:05,055
"Parade of Malice and Saints (Part 1)"

57
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:08,154
I see him in the distance!

58
00:04:08,155 --> 00:04:09,254
It's Hide!

59
00:04:09,255 --> 00:04:11,854
Naoki is also behind!

60
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:14,254
It seems like he's looking this way and waving his hand!

61
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,454
Really?

62
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,654
Hey, let me see too!

63
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:20,554
Wait a minute.

64
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:22,254
This is the best part.

65
00:04:22,255 --> 00:04:23,455
Hey!

66
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:28,954
You shouldn't climb up there!

67
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:30,754
I... I'm sorry.

68
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:32,454
I'll put him down right away.

69
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:34,954
Staying up here a little while won't hurt will it,

70
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:36,055
old lady?

71
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:39,654
Hey! What's with the old lady bit?

72
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,054
How dare you call me an old lady?

73
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:43,954
If you don't listen to me, I'm going to...

74
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:46,154
arrest you.

75
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:48,054
Officer Sato!

76
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,554
What are you doing dressed like that?

77
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:52,354
Oh, I get it!

78
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:53,754
You sneaked of from work

79
00:04:53,755 --> 00:04:57,554
and came to watch the parade in secret!

80
00:04:57,555 --> 00:05:00,454
I see! That's why you're in disguise!

81
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:01,754
No, I'm not!

82
00:05:01,755 --> 00:05:03,454
I have my reasons.

83
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:05,554
You're on a date, right?

84
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,454
With Officer Takagi.

85
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,054
Yumi!

86
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:10,654
I happened to see...

87
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:12,254
Saw what?

88
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:16,054
Officer Takagi choosing a wig in the restroom just now.

89
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:19,054
Dating while on the move,

90
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:22,054
you guys are pretty cool!

91
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:25,554
-No! This is... -Then...

92
00:05:25,555 --> 00:05:27,854
You can't talk about us.

93
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:30,454
You mean it's okay for officers to do stuff like that?

94
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,154
It's against service regulations.

95
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:34,854
What will become of the future of Japan?

96
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:37,854
I... I'm telling you, you got it all wrong!

97
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:40,554
We're on duty. On duty!

98
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:42,554
It's not a date!

99
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:44,354
Inspector Shiratori.

100
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:46,854
Why are you in disguise too?

101
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:52,054
We just received an odd fax at the headquarters a while ago.

102
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:54,354
"I am an anti-Spirit."

103
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,854
"Something interesting

104
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,654
will happen at the championship parade." It said.

105
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,854
And that fax was very similar

106
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:03,854
to the one that we handled previously.

107
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:07,154
That's why the First Investigation Division is here too.

108
00:06:07,155 --> 00:06:10,954
But, the culprit knows our faces,

109
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:13,654
so we disguise ourselves while investigating.

110
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:16,354
Well, it's more likely a bad prank

111
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:18,954
of some jealous fans of the championship.

112
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:20,354
What?

113
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:22,054
So it's not a date.

114
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:24,154
No, it's not!

115
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:25,654
And besides,

116
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:27,854
the date in question,

117
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,055
is supposed to be next week.

118
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:34,554
I thought that you couldn't wait till then

119
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:37,754
so you both got eager and...

120
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:40,254
I guess not then.

121
00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:42,854
Hey, how come you know about it?

122
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:45,354
Everybody knows about it.

123
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:49,054
You're going to Tropical Marine that just opened, right?

124
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:51,054
Everybody?

125
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:54,254
Don't take the Japanese police lightly.

126
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:55,454
If he takes a day off

127
00:06:55,455 --> 00:06:57,554
on the day that you're off,

128
00:06:57,555 --> 00:06:59,454
everybody can tell.

129
00:06:59,455 --> 00:07:01,054
I heard that when Officer Takagi

130
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,954
was shoved into the interrogation room

131
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,354
and cross examined by everybody,

132
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:06,754
he confessed immediately.

133
00:07:06,755 --> 00:07:08,655
Confessed?

134
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:12,955
About that...

135
00:07:15,655 --> 00:07:18,354
Well, just be careful, okay?

136
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,854
It seems that a lot of other people

137
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:24,054
asked for the same day off too.

138
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:25,154
Right...

139
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:27,454
And it also seems that rental reservation

140
00:07:27,455 --> 00:07:30,054
of the binoculars and communication equipment

141
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:32,154
for that day is full too.

142
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:34,754
Don't tell me that they're planning to keep an eye on us?

143
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,654
It sure sounds interesting.

144
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:40,854
Then, shall we go to Tropical Marine Land too!

145
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:43,754
Let's go!

146
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,354
You know what?

147
00:07:45,355 --> 00:07:47,654
I'm just going out with Officer Takagi

148
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:49,154
because I want to show him my appreciation for helping me before!

149
00:07:49,155 --> 00:07:52,054
So, it's not a date!

150
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,854
Really?

151
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,554
That's hard to believe.

152
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:58,354
I'm telling you it's true and I'm not lying.

153
00:07:58,355 --> 00:08:00,754
Believe me.

154
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:03,554
And? You're just going to sit back

155
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:05,854
and watch this all take place, Inspector Shiratori?

156
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:07,154
Oh, no.

157
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:08,954
I'm not going to wave a white flag

158
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,454
just because she refused to marry me.

159
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:15,854
They still call each other very formally.

160
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:19,254
There's still room for me to try for her.

161
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:22,054
Besides, as far as this stakeout is concerned,

162
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:26,054
I'm the one in charge.

163
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:27,354
Is that right?

164
00:08:27,355 --> 00:08:30,854
-Date... -Date...

165
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:33,654
Hey, Yumi. Help me out here, will you?

166
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:35,055
Give it your best shot!

167
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:41,655
Oh, my. Talk of the devil, look who's here.

168
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:45,654
You idiot.

169
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,755
Showing up at a time like this.

170
00:08:57,255 --> 00:08:58,655
Mr. Matsuda.

171
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:06,554
It's Officer Takagi!

172
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:09,455
You're not hiding under your disguise at all!

173
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:12,354
You've figured me out after all.

174
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:15,454
I had no idea that you guys would be here, though.

175
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,654
But all three police officers were surprised!

176
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:20,454
Really?

177
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:23,954
Yes. Sort of.

178
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:26,254
How about you, Ms. Sato?

179
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:29,655
Don't you think I disguised myself quite well?

180
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,254
Ms. Sato?

181
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:53,954
Inspector Megure gave you instructions saying that

182
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:56,754
you don't have to disguise yourself, didn't he?

183
00:09:56,755 --> 00:09:58,254
Oh, yes.

184
00:09:58,255 --> 00:09:59,754
But, I thought I should anyway.

185
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:02,054
Then, why do you come dressed like that?

186
00:10:02,055 --> 00:10:05,054
I... I'm sorry.

187
00:10:05,055 --> 00:10:06,854
Now that you know, get rid of that disguise right away

188
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:08,454
and go back to your post!

189
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:09,455
Understand?

190
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:11,255
Okay.

191
00:10:15,655 --> 00:10:20,354
I wonder if I did something I shouldn't have.

192
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:23,854
Nope. You just kind of resembled him.

193
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:25,654
The you just a while ago.

194
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:27,054
Him?

195
00:10:27,055 --> 00:10:30,054
The officer who was employed for only seven days

196
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:34,054
at First Investigation Division

197
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:35,955
before you came to headquarters.

198
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:44,555
Hide!

199
00:10:45,755 --> 00:10:47,454
-Naoki! -Naoki!

200
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:50,754
The car that Hide is in seems to have come!

201
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:53,954
Let's force ourselves to the front and take a video of him!

202
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:56,954
But since I've been taping from a while ago,

203
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:58,454
I don't think there's much tape left already.

204
00:10:58,455 --> 00:11:00,654
You mean you didn't bring any spare tape?

205
00:11:00,655 --> 00:11:02,554
I brought it!

206
00:11:02,555 --> 00:11:05,054
Then, insert it and let's get on with it!

207
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:06,055
Okay.

208
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:08,154
Come on! Hurry!

209
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:09,755
Please wait.

210
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:13,554
I wonder if everything's going to be okay.

211
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:16,254
You received an odd fax saying that

212
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:18,954
something was going to happen at this parade, didn't you?

213
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:20,054
Yes.

214
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:24,754
But it seems to have been a prank after all.

215
00:11:24,755 --> 00:11:28,154
By the way, what are you doing here, Yumi?

216
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,954
I've come to back up giving tickets for illegal parking!

217
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:31,955
There seems to be a lot of people

218
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:33,354
parked their cars all over the street

219
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:36,954
in order to see the parade, so...

220
00:11:36,955 --> 00:11:39,754
You better move your car quickly too, Officer Takagi!

221
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:41,054
Or I'll have to give you a parking ticket!

222
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:43,055
I'll move it right away.

223
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:50,655
Where are you, everybody?

224
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:57,855
Excuse me, somebody...

225
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:01,655
Hold on!

226
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:06,854
Congratulations!

227
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:10,254
But aren't you a fan of Big Osaka?

228
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:12,454
It's a wonder you came to watch this parade.

229
00:12:12,455 --> 00:12:14,654
I came to place a curse

230
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:17,255
that they won't win next year.

231
00:12:19,755 --> 00:12:22,054
Hey, where were you?

232
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:23,554
You've got to film it quick

233
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:26,154
or the car's going to leave!

234
00:12:26,155 --> 00:12:27,754
Well, the thing is...

235
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:30,354
The key...

236
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:31,455
There.

237
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:34,954
Oh, boy.

238
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:38,054
It's not my day today.

239
00:12:38,055 --> 00:12:41,654
What? Somebody took your video camera?

240
00:12:41,655 --> 00:12:45,155
Yes. Just a while ago, in the crowd.

241
00:12:50,255 --> 00:12:51,455
What is this?

242
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:57,255
"Unknown number."

243
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:05,655
What happened?

244
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,422
This is bad.

245
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:31,122
Cancel the parade immediately

246
00:13:31,123 --> 00:13:33,122
and evacuate the people!

247
00:13:33,123 --> 00:13:34,222
Yes, sir!

248
00:13:34,223 --> 00:13:36,322
What was that?

249
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:37,722
A bomb.

250
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:41,022
It seems like a car blew up.

251
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:45,322
Isn't that car Officer Takagi's car?

252
00:13:45,323 --> 00:13:48,322
Don't tell me that Officer Takagi...

253
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:50,122
It's possible.

254
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:53,022
Because just a while ago, I saw somebody go over to that car

255
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,122
from the space between the crowds.

256
00:13:55,123 --> 00:13:56,522
Darn it!

257
00:13:56,523 --> 00:13:57,822
Hey, Conan!

258
00:13:57,823 --> 00:14:00,222
Inspector Shiratori!

259
00:14:00,223 --> 00:14:02,422
Where's Officer Takagi?

260
00:14:02,423 --> 00:14:04,122
It exploded

261
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:07,922
just as he went over to the car to move it.

262
00:14:07,923 --> 00:14:11,222
If he got caught in the explosion,

263
00:14:11,223 --> 00:14:13,722
I doubt that he would make it.

264
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:15,322
Then, you mean that Officer Takagi...

265
00:14:15,323 --> 00:14:17,022
Oh, no.

266
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,522
That's only if the worst happens.

267
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:21,123
What's that supposed to mean?

268
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:26,822
I made it to safety by a hair's breadth,

269
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:29,722
so please don't talk like I didn't make it!

270
00:14:29,723 --> 00:14:31,322
Officer Takagi!

271
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:33,022
You're okay!

272
00:14:33,023 --> 00:14:35,222
Yeah, somehow.

273
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:40,122
I coincidentally found a paper bag

274
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:44,222
that wasn't under the car when I parked.

275
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,922
Just when I was about to return

276
00:14:46,923 --> 00:14:50,323
and consult with Inspector Shiratori that this may be a bomb...

277
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:55,322
The car exploded.

278
00:14:55,323 --> 00:14:58,022
It's amazing that you though the content

279
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,522
inside the paper bag may have been a bomb.

280
00:15:00,523 --> 00:15:01,822
Oh, that's because...

281
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:03,722
It's only natural.

282
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:05,422
I mentioned already

283
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:07,622
that the fax that was received at headquarters

284
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:10,222
resembled the one of a case

285
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:12,222
that we were involved with previously, right?

286
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:16,922
If the officer was briefed on the case failed to notice

287
00:15:16,923 --> 00:15:19,523
that it may have been a bomb, something is wrong.

288
00:15:20,723 --> 00:15:23,322
Talk about failing to notice, look at her.

289
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:26,822
She still doesn't seem to realize that you're okay.

290
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:29,522
-Let's stop her! -Officer Sato?

291
00:15:29,523 --> 00:15:32,622
Officer Takagi...

292
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:36,222
No, Sato! You won't make it!

293
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:38,822
It's dangerous, stay back!

294
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:41,322
But, he's still inside.

295
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:43,822
He's still inside...

296
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:45,323
He's inside!

297
00:15:48,923 --> 00:15:50,523
Hey, Miwako!

298
00:15:52,423 --> 00:15:55,022
What do you think you're doing?

299
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:58,622
I... I'm trying to lift the car up and get him out.

300
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:01,622
Officer Takagi is fine. See?

301
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:03,323
Officer Sato?

302
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,822
Aren't that burns on the palm of your hands!

303
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:12,222
Hey, we've got to treat it right away!

304
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:13,722
I guess so.

305
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,323
I'll let you take care of things from here then.

306
00:16:20,623 --> 00:16:21,923
Tears?

307
00:16:23,323 --> 00:16:27,222
It seems that the one Officer Sato was trying to rescue was...

308
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:28,622
Yes.

309
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:32,722
Probably Officer Matsuda.

310
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:34,323
Officer Matsuda?

311
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:38,722
The type of bomb is a plastic bomb!

312
00:16:38,723 --> 00:16:40,922
The detonating device is not the timer type,

313
00:16:40,923 --> 00:16:42,322
but wireless!

314
00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:47,422
A cell phone or something was probably used to activate it.

315
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,322
Then, don't tell me that...

316
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:50,522
Yes.

317
00:16:50,523 --> 00:16:51,622
The bomber was probably

318
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:55,522
watching you approach the car from somewhere nearby,

319
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:59,122
and pushed the switch of the detonation device.

320
00:16:59,123 --> 00:17:00,522
What?

321
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:01,722
Right.

322
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:05,422
Which means that although the type of bomb is not the same,

323
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:07,722
there's a high probability that

324
00:17:07,723 --> 00:17:11,422
the bomber is after the lives of the police force,

325
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,422
just as was the case three years ago!

326
00:17:13,423 --> 00:17:15,922
So, all of you keep that in mind

327
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:18,622
and work with great care,

328
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:20,622
yet speedily to arrest the bomber.

329
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,622
Excuse me.

330
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:23,722
What is it?

331
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:28,122
The bomber could've been filmed in the video camera!

332
00:17:28,123 --> 00:17:33,122
Mitsuhiko was taking video all through right near the site.

333
00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:34,422
Really?

334
00:17:34,423 --> 00:17:35,522
Yes.

335
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:37,522
Besides, somebody among the crowd,

336
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:41,422
who were watching the parade, stole the camera.

337
00:17:41,423 --> 00:17:44,222
-Yes. -The camera was stolen?

338
00:17:44,223 --> 00:17:47,422
Yes but the tape is fine!

339
00:17:47,423 --> 00:17:50,122
He inserted a new tape just before the camera was stolen

340
00:17:50,123 --> 00:17:52,922
because he was running out of tape.

341
00:17:52,923 --> 00:17:55,322
The video camera's fine too!

342
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:56,822
It was thrown away

343
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:59,722
in a trash can of a nearby station with only the tape removed!

344
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:02,722
Which means the person who stole the camera,

345
00:18:02,723 --> 00:18:06,622
wanted the tape and not the camera, right?

346
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:09,022
The only ones who would do something like that

347
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,622
has to be a fervent fan of the Spirits

348
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:15,822
that wanted the film of the parade

349
00:18:15,823 --> 00:18:19,322
or someone who didn't want to be taped,

350
00:18:19,323 --> 00:18:21,723
like the bomber, right?

351
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:27,122
We connected it to a large monitor

352
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:29,422
and looked through it but...

353
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:33,922
It was mostly only Mitsuhiko's feet.

354
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:37,522
I forgot that I kept the filming

355
00:18:37,523 --> 00:18:39,522
with the camera facing down.

356
00:18:39,523 --> 00:18:43,122
I can tell what you guys are talking about.

357
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,822
But the scene cannot be seen on the tape.

358
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:49,422
Inspector Megure gave you instructions saying that

359
00:18:49,423 --> 00:18:52,822
you don't have to disguise yourself, didn't he?

360
00:18:52,823 --> 00:18:54,122
Who is this man?

361
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:56,623
I'm sorry, that's me.

362
00:18:58,523 --> 00:19:00,922
How come you taped this part okay?

363
00:19:00,923 --> 00:19:03,522
I'm sorry, I just happened to film it.

364
00:19:03,523 --> 00:19:06,523
Hey, Officer Sato looks to be crying.

365
00:19:09,423 --> 00:19:12,922
Oh, no, well you see this is...

366
00:19:12,923 --> 00:19:18,322
Somebody is behind you near the car.

367
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,122
It looks like a passerby...

368
00:19:21,123 --> 00:19:23,322
Besides, at this distance

369
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:24,622
it's hard to tell one person from the next.

370
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:28,623
Oh, no! The camera's face down again!

371
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:32,323
And that's the end of the tape.

372
00:19:34,723 --> 00:19:36,822
It seems that the scene

373
00:19:36,823 --> 00:19:41,022
that we were expecting of the bomber placing the paper bag

374
00:19:41,023 --> 00:19:44,122
under Officer Takagi's car was not filmed.

375
00:19:44,123 --> 00:19:47,222
Maybe something was filmed in the first part of the tape,

376
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:49,322
that among the crowd!

377
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:52,123
Why don't we rewind the tape and look at it then?

378
00:19:56,423 --> 00:19:58,323
Yes, this is Megure.

379
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:00,423
What?

380
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:02,723
Another bomb went off?

381
00:20:04,623 --> 00:20:05,623
Yes.

382
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:09,122
This time it was at the phone booth in front of Haido Park.

383
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:12,022
Fortunately, nobody's been hurt, though.

384
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:13,522
From the type of bomb that was used,

385
00:20:13,523 --> 00:20:15,522
it's most likely the same bomber.

386
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:17,422
Okay, got it.

387
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:20,522
Go on and continue investigations.

388
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:21,622
Hey.

389
00:20:21,623 --> 00:20:24,422
What road is there to get

390
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,522
from the first site of the explosion to the Haido Park?

391
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:30,922
The road order of the parade of the Spirits!

392
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:35,022
Which means that the bomber is not after us, the police,

393
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:36,522
but carried out an extremely heinous prank

394
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:39,222
against the Tokyo Spirits.

395
00:20:39,223 --> 00:20:41,122
Officer Sato.

396
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:42,422
Are you all right?

397
00:20:42,423 --> 00:20:43,822
How's your hands?

398
00:20:43,823 --> 00:20:45,822
I heard you got burns.

399
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:48,622
No problem. I can go!

400
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:52,222
Okay, we've figured out what the bomber is after!

401
00:20:52,223 --> 00:20:56,322
Moreover, he may have set bombs up elsewhere too!

402
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,822
Get all the officers nearby

403
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:00,922
and go to the front of the course of the parade,

404
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:03,322
and evacuate the people in the vicinity!

405
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:04,722
Do what you can to take the suspect into custody,

406
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:08,522
then search for the bombs with all your might!

407
00:21:08,523 --> 00:21:10,123
-On the double! -Yes, sir!

408
00:21:11,223 --> 00:21:13,222
Just in case, Shiratori,

409
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:15,422
will you contact the bomb disposal crew

410
00:21:15,423 --> 00:21:17,122
and have them stand by?

411
00:21:17,123 --> 00:21:19,022
Yes, sir!

412
00:21:19,023 --> 00:21:21,822
Officer Takagi, I want you to stay back here

413
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,122
and keep checking the video.

414
00:21:24,123 --> 00:21:26,822
If you find anything, contact me immediately!

415
00:21:26,823 --> 00:21:29,222
But I want to go to the site too.

416
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:31,822
You can't. You wait back here.

417
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:35,322
Officer Sato.

418
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:38,323
And I'd like to have a word with you later.

419
00:21:44,323 --> 00:21:46,022
Strange.

420
00:21:46,023 --> 00:21:50,322
What is the culprit after anyway?

421
00:21:50,323 --> 00:21:53,122
Pretending to be the bomber of three years ago,

422
00:21:53,123 --> 00:21:55,822
sending fax to headquarters,

423
00:21:55,823 --> 00:21:59,422
and blowing up the car of the officer that is dispatched.

424
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:01,422
But, soon afterwards,

425
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:02,922
the culprit blows up a phone booth

426
00:22:02,923 --> 00:22:05,323
that has nothing to do with the police.

427
00:22:06,523 --> 00:22:08,422
I wonder if it's really only a prank

428
00:22:08,423 --> 00:22:10,623
of bad taste towards the Spirits.

429
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:16,223
And, besides, this tape that Mitsuhiko took.

430
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:21,222
Is something that will point out the bomber

431
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:22,923
really filmed on it?

432
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:26,422
If so,

433
00:22:26,423 --> 00:22:29,023
what was filmed?

434
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:03,922
"Next Episode" -Are you really watching it carefully?

435
00:24:03,923 --> 00:24:06,522
I watched it three time already.

436
00:24:06,523 --> 00:24:08,822
If you think that the crowd is suspicious,

437
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:11,022
everybody in the crowd looks suspicious

438
00:24:11,023 --> 00:24:12,222
and if you think nothing is suspicious,

439
00:24:12,223 --> 00:24:14,422
nothing looks suspicious.

440
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:18,922
Maybe the culprit thought he was being filmed

441
00:24:18,923 --> 00:24:22,022
although nothing was filmed?

442
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:23,822
Nothing was filmed?

443
00:24:23,823 --> 00:24:25,023
I see!

444
00:24:25,723 --> 00:24:27,222
Next Conan,

445
00:24:27,223 --> 00:24:31,523
"Parade of Malice and Saints (Part 2)"
