1
00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:03,838
As compensation for what happened on the Bell Tree Express,

2
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:07,338
Sonoko invited us to go to Izu Highlands.

3
00:00:08,538 --> 00:00:11,538
And for some reason, Tohru Amuro was also there

4
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:14,238
as a tennis coach.

5
00:00:15,938 --> 00:00:17,438
Conan!

6
00:00:17,438 --> 00:00:19,038
By some queer work of fate,

7
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:20,538
we ended up taking a rest at a villa

8
00:00:20,538 --> 00:00:22,638
where a group of tennis club members were gathered.

9
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:25,038
However, when I came to, lying next to me on the floor

10
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:27,438
was a corpse in an unnatural position.

11
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:31,838
Aiming for a 100% solution.

12
00:00:31,838 --> 00:00:34,238
He cleared all mysteries and codes.

13
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:36,338
I deduced the locked room murder with Bourbon?

14
00:00:36,338 --> 00:00:38,438
What's he after sticking around me?

15
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,038
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:42,138
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:44,338
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:28,274
"Bourbon Solves the Mystery"

19
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:34,674
Yes. I went to Ishiguri's room

20
00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:36,674
to ask him if he really didn't want

21
00:02:36,674 --> 00:02:38,674
cold Chinese noodles for lunch.

22
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:41,274
"Kotone Momozono (21)" -But he said he didn't want it since he wanted

23
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:42,974
"University Student" -to eat the ice cake from yesterday.

24
00:02:42,974 --> 00:02:44,274
I see.

25
00:02:44,274 --> 00:02:46,574
Then, what did you do after that?

26
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:49,474
After eating lunch with everyone in the kitchen,

27
00:02:49,474 --> 00:02:51,174
I took a shower.

28
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:54,974
Come to think of it, my girls also said they took a shower.

29
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:59,574
Yes. After that, I stayed with them

30
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:03,274
until I went to check on Ishiguri together with Machi.

31
00:03:03,274 --> 00:03:07,774
By the way, when did the spare key to Mr. Ishiguri's room disappear?

32
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:09,574
I think it was last night.

33
00:03:09,574 --> 00:03:14,074
I had the key in the drawer in my room.

34
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:16,374
Yes, that's right.

35
00:03:16,374 --> 00:03:18,274
"Machi Umejima (22)" -I went to check on Ishiguri

36
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:19,674
"University Student" -together with Kotone.

37
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:22,974
You went there just that once?

38
00:03:22,974 --> 00:03:25,774
I also went there before I took a shower.

39
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:28,574
I wanted to tell him that I was going to use the shower

40
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:30,774
because I experienced him peeping me some time ago.

41
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:33,574
Did you take a shower after Ms. Kotone?

42
00:03:33,574 --> 00:03:34,674
Yes.

43
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:38,174
And? Was Mr. Ishiguri in the room back then?

44
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:40,674
He didn't answer back then,

45
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:42,574
but I think he was in his room.

46
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:44,974
It seems like the air conditioner was running.

47
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,274
Then, what were you doing before and after the shower?

48
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:48,974
Like I already said.

49
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:50,874
I was getting lunch ready

50
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:53,874
and mending the girls' racket.

51
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:57,474
At any rate, I was with somebody all the time.

52
00:03:57,474 --> 00:03:59,674
Yes, I also went there

53
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:01,574
to apologize to Ishiguri.

54
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,674
"Noboru Takanashi (22)" -I kind of had it out with him before lunch.

55
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:06,574
"University Student" -I wanted to tell him that I am sorry.

56
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:10,874
Do you know if that was before or after Ms. Machi took a shower?

57
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:14,674
I don't know when Machi took a shower,

58
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:16,474
but it was after cleaning the dishes

59
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:17,974
and before taking out the garbage.

60
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:20,174
Come to think of it, that fight had something to do

61
00:04:20,174 --> 00:04:23,374
with a member of the circle who passed away, right?

62
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:24,574
Right.

63
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:27,874
This winter, a man called Uryu passed away.

64
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:29,274
He was a member of our circle,

65
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:30,874
and he was found buried in the snow behind the lodge

66
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:32,674
after he went skiing.

67
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:36,674
Back then, the snow behind the lodge lay as high as 2 meters.

68
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:39,874
He took Ishiguri's joke saying that

69
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:42,074
jumping from the second floor into it wouldn't kill him literally.

70
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,274
He actually jumped into it.

71
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:47,374
Yesterday was Uryu's birthday,

72
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:50,374
so we all got together to celebrate it.

73
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:54,174
He had a terrible birthday last year.

74
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:56,474
A terrible birthday?

75
00:04:56,474 --> 00:05:00,674
We got together last year at about the same time,

76
00:05:00,674 --> 00:05:02,774
and since it was Uryu's birthday,

77
00:05:02,774 --> 00:05:06,374
Ishiguri said that we should surprise him.

78
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:10,474
We snuck into the room Uryu was sleeping in through the veranda

79
00:05:10,474 --> 00:05:13,974
and popped some party crackers near his ear.

80
00:05:13,974 --> 00:05:18,374
Then he got panic and started crying.

81
00:05:18,374 --> 00:05:20,974
On top of that, a video of his plight was taken

82
00:05:20,974 --> 00:05:23,074
and it was uploaded on the web by Ishiguri.

83
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:24,474
I see.

84
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:26,274
As to you three,

85
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:30,374
it seems that you all have more than enough motive to kill Mr. Ishiguri.

86
00:05:30,374 --> 00:05:31,874
Motive?

87
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:35,274
The only time I went to Ishiguri's room was just that once.

88
00:05:35,274 --> 00:05:38,674
Other than that, I was with all of you the whole time, wasn't I?

89
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:41,474
I was with you while the detective was talking.

90
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,874
"The air conditioner in this room isn't working well,

91
00:05:43,874 --> 00:05:46,574
so go to Ishiguri's room and rest."

92
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:49,074
Wasn't it me who told that to the kid?

93
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:51,274
-Is that true? -Yes.

94
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:53,974
After that, I saw Mr. Ishiguri in the corridor,

95
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:55,774
so I had him take me with him.

96
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:57,674
How could I possibly commit murder

97
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:59,674
knowing that a child is sleeping in the room?

98
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:01,174
True.

99
00:06:03,374 --> 00:06:05,874
No matter what kind of trick was used,

100
00:06:05,874 --> 00:06:08,174
I thought it was only possible for a man

101
00:06:08,174 --> 00:06:09,674
to move the heavy corpse of Mr. Ishiguri,

102
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:12,874
which was none other than the only male suspect, Mr. Takanashi.

103
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:14,574
-Yes. -But...

104
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,274
if it was only to lift the top part of the body,

105
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:18,474
wouldn't a woman be able to do it too?

106
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:20,774
One could place the corpse up against the doorway

107
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:22,974
and let go of the body so it would slide down,

108
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:24,574
then finally close the door.

109
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:27,374
No. I think that would be impossible

110
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:29,374
because the buttocks of the corpse

111
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:31,074
was in a position that blocked the door.

112
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:33,874
Besides, the spare key to Mr. Ishiguri's room

113
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:35,974
hasn't been found yet either.

114
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:38,074
What's the key like?

115
00:06:38,074 --> 00:06:40,374
It seems to have been the same kind

116
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:42,974
as the one found in the pocket of the corpse.

117
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:45,774
We haven't heard that it's been found yet.

118
00:06:45,774 --> 00:06:48,374
Then, maybe it was disposed together with the trash?

119
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:52,274
I helped throw the trash away together with Ran.

120
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:53,474
What?

121
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:57,374
We put it into the trunk of Mr. Takanashi's car, though.

122
00:06:57,374 --> 00:07:00,274
We were told that he would take it home and throw it away.

123
00:07:00,274 --> 00:07:04,274
Then, maybe the key is in that trash.

124
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:05,674
Check it immediately!

125
00:07:05,674 --> 00:07:07,474
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

126
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:11,574
Did anyone else ask you to do anything else?

127
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:14,374
Ms. Kotone asked us to put the sports drink

128
00:07:14,374 --> 00:07:16,674
back into the freezer.

129
00:07:16,674 --> 00:07:17,974
So we did that.

130
00:07:17,974 --> 00:07:20,374
Put the sports drink into the freezer?

131
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:23,074
She said that she likes to drink it frozen.

132
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:25,774
At the time, there was a fuss

133
00:07:25,774 --> 00:07:26,974
about Mr. Ishiguri not coming out of his room.

134
00:07:26,974 --> 00:07:30,574
Ms. Kotone was holding a PET bottle.

135
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:33,774
I think she wanted to freeze it again because it was starting to melt.

136
00:07:33,774 --> 00:07:36,274
She just made it look like that and put the key in there.

137
00:07:36,274 --> 00:07:39,074
A key wouldn't fit inside.

138
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:44,874
After I took a shower, I took a sip of that drink,

139
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:46,774
but it was totally frozen.

140
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:48,674
Oh, that's right.

141
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:51,174
Ms. Machi told us that she would re-wrap

142
00:07:51,174 --> 00:07:53,674
the grip tapes of our rackets.

143
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,674
We left our rackets with her.

144
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:57,374
And while she was at it, she also changed

145
00:07:57,374 --> 00:08:00,374
the strings of our rackets, too.

146
00:08:01,474 --> 00:08:03,374
Inspector Yokomizo.

147
00:08:03,374 --> 00:08:06,774
We found no key in the trash.

148
00:08:06,774 --> 00:08:07,874
I see.

149
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:10,874
The sports drink in the freezer is frozen solid

150
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:15,474
and it doesn't seem possible for a key to be inside it.

151
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:17,574
What about the rackets?

152
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:20,474
We checked the rackets of everyone,

153
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:22,874
but there wasn't anything that looks like a key attached anywhere.

154
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:24,574
Speaking of rackets, we got a report

155
00:08:24,574 --> 00:08:27,274
that the strings of the racket under the corpse's buttocks

156
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,774
seem to be out of shape in several spots.

157
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:32,474
The strings? Why?

158
00:08:32,474 --> 00:08:33,574
We don't know.

159
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:37,474
Also, the shape of the copper vase that had blood on it,

160
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:40,674
matched the wound on the head of the corpse.

161
00:08:40,674 --> 00:08:44,074
But for some reason, it seems there was water in the vase.

162
00:08:44,074 --> 00:08:45,474
Water?

163
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:47,774
Why would water be inside the murder weapon?

164
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:50,274
By the way, the estimated time of death

165
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:53,474
was two to three hours before the corpse was found.

166
00:08:53,474 --> 00:08:56,274
Depending on the temperature of the room at that time,

167
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:59,874
there may be a discrepancy of about 30 minutes or so.

168
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:02,974
I had lunch with everyone here

169
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:06,074
around three hours before the corpse was found.

170
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:10,774
All three of them had the chance to commit the crime.

171
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:14,174
You. Didn't you see the culprit?

172
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:16,274
You were in the room the whole time, weren't you?

173
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:18,374
I was fast asleep.

174
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:22,174
So you also don't remember that Sonoko and I

175
00:09:22,174 --> 00:09:24,274
took the cold Chinese noodles to that room, do you?

176
00:09:24,274 --> 00:09:26,574
Nope. I think I was asleep.

177
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:28,774
Come to think of it, Ran.

178
00:09:28,774 --> 00:09:32,474
Back then, you said something weird, didn't you?

179
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:35,174
It seems he's asleep, so why not let him be?

180
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,674
Missing lunch won't kill him either.

181
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:38,974
That's true.

182
00:09:38,974 --> 00:09:42,674
It seems that the air conditioner of this room is working, too.

183
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:44,974
How would you know that

184
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:46,774
despite being outside of the room?

185
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:50,474
That's because my toes were cold.

186
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:52,674
I'm sure that cold air was leaking out

187
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:54,974
through the space under the door.

188
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:58,274
If I remember correctly, Ms. Machi said something similar.

189
00:09:58,274 --> 00:10:00,174
I think he was in the room.

190
00:10:00,174 --> 00:10:02,374
It seems like the air conditioner was running.

191
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:07,474
I see. That's how it is.

192
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:11,174
The culprit ingeniously used an object that doesn't keep its form

193
00:10:11,174 --> 00:10:15,174
and completed the locked room murder.

194
00:10:18,412 --> 00:10:19,912
Officer.

195
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,152
Maybe it was an accident after all?

196
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:26,852
Ishiguri's corpse was on the floor and was blocking the door.

197
00:10:26,852 --> 00:10:29,752
If there was a racket under his buttocks,

198
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:32,952
maybe when he tried to pick up the racket,

199
00:10:32,952 --> 00:10:36,852
the vase just happened to fall on him?

200
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:39,752
On top of that, the room was locked.

201
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:42,752
The spare key hasn't been found yet, has it?

202
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:44,252
No.

203
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:47,552
The area around the villa is being checked now.

204
00:10:47,552 --> 00:10:48,952
However, we've still got no such report.

205
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,552
I don't care what it is,

206
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:52,352
but this is what I call messy handwriting.

207
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,452
As long as I can read it, it's fine.

208
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:56,852
Okay, he sat down.

209
00:10:56,852 --> 00:11:00,752
Like usual, I'll fire the tranquilizer gun at Pops.

210
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:04,852
What are you doing, Conan?

211
00:11:04,852 --> 00:11:08,252
The lid of my wristwatch broke.

212
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,552
Even if I wanted to, I guess I can't start

213
00:11:11,552 --> 00:11:14,052
the Sleeping Kogoro stunt in front of him.

214
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:17,852
He's Bourbon, a member of the Black Organization.

215
00:11:17,852 --> 00:11:19,852
I can't afford to have him find out that I'm Shinichi Kudo,

216
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:21,852
whose body has become a child's because of the organization's drug.

217
00:11:21,852 --> 00:11:24,852
Even if Vermouth says nothing about it,

218
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:28,052
they may still find out that the same thing's happened to Ai, too.

219
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:30,452
Besides,

220
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:33,052
maybe the sound that we heard when we were downstairs

221
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:35,852
wasn't the sound of the vase falling, was it?

222
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:37,752
Back then, only the corpse

223
00:11:37,752 --> 00:11:40,452
and the sleeping boy were in that room.

224
00:11:40,452 --> 00:11:43,352
Besides, the vase wouldn't fall on its own.

225
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:47,352
I guess it was the sound of the house creaking after all.

226
00:11:47,352 --> 00:11:48,752
If it was the creaking of the house,

227
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:51,452
I also heard it when we were eating cold Chinese noodles.

228
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:53,052
It was totally different.

229
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:54,652
Hey, hey.

230
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:57,152
Speaking of cold Chinese noodles,

231
00:11:57,152 --> 00:11:58,852
you use ice when making it, right?

232
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,952
Yes. The noodles that are boiled

233
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:03,952
are cooled down in ice water.

234
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:07,252
Hey, cut out the unnecessary talk.

235
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:12,452
But ice melts, doesn't it?

236
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:14,352
That's common sense!

237
00:12:14,352 --> 00:12:17,652
If so, if the vase was made of ice,

238
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:20,752
it would eventually melt and fall on its own.

239
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:22,052
You idiot.

240
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:24,052
That vase is made of bronze.

241
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:26,652
I mean, you touched it too, didn't you?

242
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:29,152
Please wait.

243
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:32,552
If a lot of ice is stacked

244
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,652
only on one side in the vase,

245
00:12:34,652 --> 00:12:38,252
and it was placed near the rim of the shelf,

246
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:40,252
it's just a matter of time before the ice would melt,

247
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:43,552
and the vase would tilt out of balance and fall on its own, right?

248
00:12:43,552 --> 00:12:47,252
But if a large amount of ice were to be carried around,

249
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:49,252
wouldn't anyone have noticed it?

250
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:53,452
No, you can do so without holding it in your hands.

251
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:55,452
When the Chinese noodles were being made,

252
00:12:55,452 --> 00:12:58,652
all three of them were in their tennis wear.

253
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:02,652
The pants of men's tennis wear have large pockets

254
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:05,552
so that tennis balls would fit into them.

255
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:08,852
There are also skirts in women's tennis wear

256
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:10,852
with pockets big enough for the balls to fit in.

257
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:12,852
But...

258
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:16,152
even if it were possible to automatically drop the vase,

259
00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:17,752
it wouldn't be possible to move the corpse

260
00:13:17,752 --> 00:13:19,452
over to the door, would it?

261
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:22,452
There were no drag trails on the floor either.

262
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:24,652
Come to think of it,

263
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:26,652
ice is very slippery, isn't it?

264
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:28,352
Not you again, brat.

265
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:31,452
I see! I've figured it out!

266
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:34,952
Remember the racket under the buttocks of the corpse?

267
00:13:34,952 --> 00:13:37,452
The corpse was moved by placing ice under the racket

268
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:40,052
that was under the buttocks of the corpse.

269
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:43,052
The strings of the racket being out of shape proves just that!

270
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:45,052
Wow, Sonoko!

271
00:13:45,052 --> 00:13:47,752
But if that was the case,

272
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:50,152
like the vase, water from the melted ice

273
00:13:50,152 --> 00:13:52,152
should be left on the floor.

274
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:55,152
And the slacks of the corpse should also be wet.

275
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:58,752
But there were no such traces.

276
00:13:58,752 --> 00:14:00,052
Is that so?

277
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:01,652
It would've been nice if there was something

278
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:05,452
like ice that leaves nothing behind even after it melts.

279
00:14:05,452 --> 00:14:09,252
Could that be dry ice, then?

280
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:12,052
Dry ice is made of carbon dioxide,

281
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,952
so it will vanish.

282
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:19,352
But dry ice can't be carried around easily.

283
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:21,752
Unlike ice, you can't touch it directly.

284
00:14:21,752 --> 00:14:25,452
Mr. Ishiguri unknowingly carried it with him.

285
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:28,752
After deciding to have lunch, he was about to go to his room.

286
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:33,352
Someone must've secretly put dry ice inside the ice cake box.

287
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:35,052
The culprit probably took a racket with a string

288
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:38,152
after hitting Mr. Ishiguri on the head with the vase and killing him.

289
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:40,152
The racket that had a string pulled through it beforehand

290
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:44,452
was placed on top of several pieces of dry ice.

291
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:47,852
Then, the buttocks of the corpse were placed on the racket.

292
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:49,652
After the culprit left the room,

293
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:53,052
the string was pulled towards the door.

294
00:14:53,052 --> 00:14:55,252
Of course, the string was left untied

295
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:56,952
so that it could be retrieved later.

296
00:14:56,952 --> 00:14:58,352
I see.

297
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:03,152
That's why when I went to that room, my toes felt chilly.

298
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,352
It was because the dry ice was near the door.

299
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:10,052
Come to think of it, Ms. Machi said something similar, too.

300
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:11,352
Yes.

301
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:14,052
Didn't any of you notice anything?

302
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:16,552
-No. -Neither did I.

303
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:20,552
I figured that the boy was sleeping in the room,

304
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,252
so I left right away.

305
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:24,152
I see.

306
00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:27,352
I've finally figured out the culprit.

307
00:15:28,252 --> 00:15:32,052
First of all, we could remove Ms. Machi from the list of suspects

308
00:15:32,052 --> 00:15:36,052
because she testified that there was dry ice.

309
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:39,752
And the same goes for Mr. Takanashi

310
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:41,852
who knew that the boy was in Mr. Ishiguri's room.

311
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:45,052
Since there probably isn't anyone who would commit a murder

312
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:47,052
right next to a sleeping child.

313
00:15:47,052 --> 00:15:49,352
If so, rather than the two, the culprit is the one

314
00:15:49,352 --> 00:15:51,752
who went to Mr. Ishiguri's room before them.

315
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:55,552
The one who could buy enough time for the ice and dry ice to melt.

316
00:15:55,552 --> 00:15:58,852
Ms. Kotone Momozono.

317
00:15:58,852 --> 00:16:02,752
The culprit is none other than you!

318
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,452
Am I wrong?

319
00:16:05,452 --> 00:16:08,152
Hey... Hold it there, Mr. Mouri.

320
00:16:08,152 --> 00:16:11,152
Is it alright for you not to do your usual stunt?

321
00:16:11,152 --> 00:16:14,452
-What? -The sleeping pose!

322
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:17,852
For once, he's doing it right and then.

323
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,452
So, the procedure Ms. Kotone took to commit the crime is as follows.

324
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:25,352
First, while she was making the cold Chinese noodles,

325
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:28,252
she snuck the ice into her skirt pocket.

326
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:32,452
She said, "I'll go and ask if Ishiguri wants lunch".

327
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:35,152
With that, she left for his room.

328
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:39,152
Then, after hitting Mr. Ishiguri to death near the door,

329
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:41,052
she packed the murder weapon vase with ice

330
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:42,552
and put it on the shelf.

331
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:45,152
So, like the trick mentioned earlier, after she left the room,

332
00:16:45,152 --> 00:16:49,652
she moved Mr. Ishiguri's corpse so that it would block the door.

333
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:51,052
At that time, she had no idea

334
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:54,452
that the boy with glasses was sleeping there.

335
00:16:54,452 --> 00:16:57,152
After returning to the kitchen, Ms. Kotone said,

336
00:16:57,152 --> 00:17:01,652
"He's not eating cold Chinese noodles after all".

337
00:17:01,652 --> 00:17:03,752
Just like that, she lied, ate lunch as if nothing had happened,

338
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:06,852
and completed the locked room murder.

339
00:17:06,852 --> 00:17:11,052
But it seems you couldn't deceive the eyes of this famed detective.

340
00:17:12,752 --> 00:17:15,752
Somehow, he looks more quack when he's awake.

341
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:17,152
I guess so.

342
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:20,252
Then, where's the spare key?

343
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:23,552
The door of Ishiguri's room was locked, wasn't it?

344
00:17:23,552 --> 00:17:25,652
Well, most probably...

345
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:28,952
I'm sure we'll find it somewhere in time.

346
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:31,552
That's right. Speaking of ice...

347
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,952
-Ice... -Ice?

348
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,652
When water freezes, it become icy, right?

349
00:17:35,652 --> 00:17:38,052
That's why it's called ice, right?

350
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:42,352
How should I know?

351
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,052
Talking about frozen water,

352
00:17:44,052 --> 00:17:46,852
the sports drink that Ms. Kotone was drinking...

353
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:49,152
Was the key in there, after all?

354
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,352
No way.

355
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:53,152
I drank that drink too,

356
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:57,152
but it was virtually frozen and the contents wouldn't come out.

357
00:17:57,152 --> 00:18:00,452
Then, maybe the key was put inside before it was frozen.

358
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:02,652
If so, I think it should show

359
00:18:02,652 --> 00:18:04,552
through the bottom of the PET bottle.

360
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,252
That's because keys are heavy.

361
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:10,452
However, if there is magic water that freezes

362
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:12,952
the minute the key is put inside, maybe it's possible.

363
00:18:12,952 --> 00:18:16,652
Idiot. There's no such cartoon-like water.

364
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:18,452
There is.

365
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:19,952
Super-cooled water.

366
00:18:19,952 --> 00:18:22,152
Water is supposed to freeze when it reaches freezing point.

367
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:24,452
However, this water remains unfrozen

368
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:26,852
even after reaching below 0 degree Celcius.

369
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:28,852
When stimulated by the impact of vibration or such,

370
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:31,552
it will suddenly begin to freeze.

371
00:18:31,552 --> 00:18:34,052
The method to make it is to wrap a towel

372
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:36,252
around the PET bottle so that it chills evenly.

373
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:38,252
Leave it in a freezer at around -5 degrees Celcius

374
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:40,552
for four to five hours.

375
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,052
When impact is applied,

376
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:44,052
it will start freezing from the top

377
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:46,852
and all along the face of the PET bottle.

378
00:18:46,852 --> 00:18:49,552
Ms. Kotone probably put the key

379
00:18:49,552 --> 00:18:52,452
into the super-cooled sports drink in the PET bottle,

380
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:53,852
applied impact to it,

381
00:18:53,852 --> 00:18:56,452
then turned it upside down when the top part started to freeze.

382
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:58,652
Therefore, the key could flow to the middle

383
00:18:58,652 --> 00:19:00,252
before the entire content was frozen.

384
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:02,752
Then, she let Ms. Sonoko drink it.

385
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:07,952
Since sports drink is thickly colored

386
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:09,452
and looks gel-like when frozen,

387
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:12,052
the key inside wasn't visible.

388
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:15,452
Then, if that sports drink is melted...

389
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:18,152
Yes, I'm sure it'll come out.

390
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:22,652
The evidence that proves Ms. Kotone had killed Mr. Ishiguri.

391
00:19:23,952 --> 00:19:26,252
Say that after it comes out, will you?

392
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:28,252
If it doesn't come out, you guys...

393
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:29,952
It's no use.

394
00:19:31,352 --> 00:19:33,152
Because it'll come out.

395
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:37,252
The spare key with my fingerprints all over it.

396
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:39,752
Moreover, I panicked and dropped that key

397
00:19:39,752 --> 00:19:42,852
on top of Ishiguri's blood, too.

398
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:45,452
No... No way. I drank the drink

399
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,052
that had that stuff in it?

400
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,352
But why did you kill Ishiguri?

401
00:19:49,352 --> 00:19:52,152
Of course, it was to avenge Uryu's death.

402
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:54,652
I liked him.

403
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:59,652
Are you talking about the time when Uryu took Ishiguri's joke literally?

404
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:01,952
It's true that Ishiguri told him that with all the snow,

405
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:04,552
even if he jumped from the second floor, he wouldn't die.

406
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:08,252
It was a careless statement that Ishiguri had made.

407
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:11,852
The night when Uryu's body was carried off,

408
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:15,052
I couldn't sleep, so I went out to the veranda

409
00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:18,452
and saw Ishiguri digging up the snow.

410
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:21,052
At first, I thought that he couldn't believe

411
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:22,452
that Mr. Uryu had died

412
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:27,552
and was somehow trying to look for him.

413
00:20:27,552 --> 00:20:29,452
But what he was looking for

414
00:20:29,452 --> 00:20:33,052
was the scarf that he had wrapped around his neck.

415
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:35,152
The smile on his face when he saw it

416
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:37,752
told the entire story.

417
00:20:37,752 --> 00:20:41,752
Uryu didn't dive into the snow intentionally,

418
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:44,452
but was rather pushed off.

419
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,152
Don't tell me that Ishiguri...

420
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:47,552
Yes.

421
00:20:47,552 --> 00:20:51,152
Uryu reflexively grabbed it when he was pushed off.

422
00:20:51,152 --> 00:20:53,752
Ishiguri's scarf.

423
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,852
He was probably going to help him up

424
00:20:56,852 --> 00:21:00,952
after Uryu struggled and got completely exhausted.

425
00:21:00,952 --> 00:21:02,452
However, the new snow that lay 2-meters high

426
00:21:02,452 --> 00:21:06,052
deprived Uryu's energy as if he was in a quicksand.

427
00:21:06,052 --> 00:21:10,052
When we found him, he was already...

428
00:21:10,052 --> 00:21:12,052
But I goofed.

429
00:21:12,052 --> 00:21:16,252
In order to make sure that Ishiguri would eat ice cake for lunch,

430
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:19,652
I deliberately schemed to slightly hurt a random person

431
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:21,852
so that I could invite him over to the villa,

432
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:24,352
in hope that the number of people eating lunch would increase.

433
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,352
I never imagined the racket would hit a child on the head.

434
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,452
Moreover, that child happened to be accompanied

435
00:21:29,452 --> 00:21:33,352
by the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri.

436
00:21:33,352 --> 00:21:36,552
I may have also been trapped in a quicksand

437
00:21:36,552 --> 00:21:39,852
that sinks deeper the more I struggle

438
00:21:39,852 --> 00:21:42,252
towards my own demise.

439
00:23:03,152 --> 00:23:06,452
Yes, the case was solved.

440
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:08,452
It's all thanks to the famed Detective Mouri.

441
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:10,052
Is that so?

442
00:23:10,052 --> 00:23:11,952
By the way, how long to you plan to stick around

443
00:23:11,952 --> 00:23:13,752
with that detective?

444
00:23:13,752 --> 00:23:16,552
You said the detective seems to have some connection with Sherry,

445
00:23:16,552 --> 00:23:19,652
and have wanted to stick around him.

446
00:23:19,652 --> 00:23:22,152
So I tried backing you up in many ways.

447
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:24,552
I don't think he's of any use to you anymore, is he?

448
00:23:24,552 --> 00:23:27,352
Fortunately, information on Sherry came in,

449
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:30,252
and you were able to lay her to rest, too.

450
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:36,452
No. I'm even more interested now

451
00:23:36,452 --> 00:23:40,852
in the detective called the Sleeping Kogoro.

452
00:23:43,652 --> 00:23:45,452
Who are you?

453
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:49,852
Thanks to you, somebody's going to die.

454
00:23:52,352 --> 00:23:56,152
I was looking outside when I happened to see you.

455
00:23:56,152 --> 00:23:58,852
I felt nostalgic that I decided to call you.

456
00:23:58,852 --> 00:23:59,852
Cut out the joke!

457
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:01,952
What was that call a while ago about?

458
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:04,852
Hello, Inspector. This is Mouri.

459
00:24:04,852 --> 00:24:07,752
I have a favor to ask you.

460
00:24:07,752 --> 00:24:12,252
