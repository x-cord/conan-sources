"Tottori Station."

2
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:10,174
We accompanied Pops to Tottori Prefecture.

3
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:11,574
We're finally here!

4
00:00:11,575 --> 00:00:13,074
Yes!

5
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:15,974
But, why Tottori?

6
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:17,774
Why?

7
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:20,175
Well, it's because...

"Tottori Sand Dunes"

9
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:33,775
I'm going to dispose of you in the sand dune!

10
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,275
Conan!

11
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:47,574
The first Super Mystery Awards!

12
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:51,374
I decided to apply for this!

13
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,574
A suspense that describes

14
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:56,374
how a brat that is tied up and left behind all alone

15
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:59,874
at this sand dune makes it out safely!

16
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,274
I'm here to come up with how he does it.

17
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:03,874
I don't know why you suddenly came up

18
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,474
with the idea of wanting to write a novel.

19
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:08,974
But I think that setting is not quite possible.

20
00:01:08,975 --> 00:01:10,074
Not possible?

21
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:11,174
Yes!

22
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:14,874
But it's for sure that someone would come to the rescue right away.

23
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,775
-Right? -What?

24
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,275
This place is forever filled with tourists.

25
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:28,274
This is going to be changed to an ordinary sightseeing trip as of now.

26
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:30,975
First of all, let's go to the Sand Art Museum that's right over there!

27
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:35,975
Dad.

28
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,874
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

29
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,074
Love and cases come from the same origin.

30
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:46,874
Like the sands of the Tottori Sand Dunes.

31
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,974
The mystery of the robbery can't quite be grasped.

32
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,474
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:52,275
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,500
His name is Detective Conan!

00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:43,462
Hey!

38
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:45,262
What's this?

39
00:03:45,263 --> 00:03:47,862
It's nothing more than a clump of sand!

40
00:03:47,863 --> 00:03:51,462
What a rip off taking money to see something like this!

41
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:54,062
Rip off...

42
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:57,162
This is a piece of art, you see.

43
00:03:57,163 --> 00:04:00,862
Heck. I wasted my time and money.

44
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:03,962
It's late. That clock.

45
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:06,162
It shouldn't be.

46
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,362
1 hour...

47
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:08,662
05 min.

48
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:11,462
This clock is accurate, yes?

49
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:14,362
What's with you, lewd mustache jerk?

50
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:15,363
Outta my way!

51
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:16,563
Hey!

52
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:20,462
What's with her?

53
00:04:20,463 --> 00:04:23,262
She looked like she was doing it on purpose.

54
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,363
Maybe she's just super stressed out.

55
00:04:32,163 --> 00:04:33,762
Rip off, she says...

56
00:04:33,763 --> 00:04:36,262
They sure can make unthinkable things by sand.

57
00:04:36,263 --> 00:04:38,862
After they exhibit it for a year,

58
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:41,462
I hear they destroy it and make something new.

59
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:43,262
What a waste.

60
00:04:43,263 --> 00:04:46,562
Maybe the transience is what's so attractive about it.

61
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:49,262
I'm so moved, that I'm getting hungry.

62
00:04:49,263 --> 00:04:50,562
What?

63
00:04:50,563 --> 00:04:53,662
Since we're in Tottori, that's known for its pears and shallots.

64
00:04:53,663 --> 00:04:55,962
But nothing can beat...

65
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,562
Crabs!

66
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,162
Right!

67
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:01,162
If I remember correctly, there was...

68
00:05:01,163 --> 00:05:04,162
The name is, yes, the Kanikkokan!

69
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:07,162
-I'll eat my heart out! -Yes!

70
00:05:07,163 --> 00:05:09,263
But it's...

71
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:14,262
You get to see crabs, but don't get to eat them?

72
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:17,162
Seems so.

73
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:20,163
Shall we go to the place called Kurayoshi next?

74
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:23,663
"Kurayoshi Station" -It's about 30 minutes by Limited Express, it says.

76
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:31,162
Thanks for waiting!

77
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:33,562
I had them keep our luggage for us.

78
00:05:33,563 --> 00:05:35,462
They say that there's a place up ahead where the storehouses

79
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:37,963
that were made during the Edo and Meiji periods are.

80
00:05:48,863 --> 00:05:51,563
It's a historical town, don't you think?

81
00:05:57,963 --> 00:06:00,062
Yamane.

82
00:06:00,063 --> 00:06:01,962
Mr. Mouri?

83
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:04,962
We worked together during a joint investigation in the past.

84
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:07,363
It's when you were at MPD, right, Dad?

85
00:06:08,763 --> 00:06:12,262
Thank you so much for everything back then.

86
00:06:12,263 --> 00:06:14,562
-The famed detective. -Yes.

87
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:17,662
He's always talking about you.

88
00:06:17,663 --> 00:06:19,662
What's up?

89
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:22,062
-Okamoto. -Yes, sir.

90
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,962
We got a report that there was a robbery.

91
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:26,463
What?

92
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:32,262
No answer.

93
00:06:32,263 --> 00:06:35,662
May I look in, too?

94
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:36,763
Yes, sir.

95
00:06:56,463 --> 00:06:57,862
Help me.

96
00:06:57,863 --> 00:06:59,463
What happened?

97
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:07,962
I'm Yamane from the Kurayoshi Police Department.

98
00:07:07,963 --> 00:07:10,062
Are you the one who called us?

99
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,862
I'm Shuko Kumado.

100
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,262
I'm the wife of the oldest son here.

101
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:15,362
And, the perp?

102
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:17,862
I was passed out, so...

103
00:07:17,863 --> 00:07:20,162
He got away during that time.

104
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:21,963
Thank you for saving me.

105
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:25,462
The incense burner is gone?

106
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:27,462
The precious household treasure that was here!

107
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:30,462
So, that was stolen?

108
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:34,363
I... I've done something irreparable.

109
00:07:36,063 --> 00:07:38,263
Please don't cry and give us the details.

110
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:43,562
There's something on the floor here.

111
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,863
What?

112
00:07:51,463 --> 00:07:52,862
You idiot!

113
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:55,563
You mean you can't even watch the house, right?

114
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:58,762
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:58,763 --> 00:08:01,862
Mr. Kumado.

116
00:08:01,863 --> 00:08:04,562
He is the head of the household, Mr. Iwao Kumado.

117
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:07,162
This is the famed detective.

118
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:10,262
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

119
00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:13,663
I happened to be nearby with my daughter and the boy, so...

120
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:19,662
Do I have to introduce my family to you, too?

121
00:08:19,663 --> 00:08:21,662
She's my oldest daughter, Makie.

122
00:08:21,663 --> 00:08:23,462
"Makie Kumado (35)" -She's divorced and lives here now.

123
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:25,862
You didn't need to say that.

124
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:27,762
He's my oldest son, Soichi.

125
00:08:27,763 --> 00:08:29,962
He's helping me with my business,

126
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:32,062
"Soichi Kumado (32)" -but can't be relied on at all.

127
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:34,062
Father.

128
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:35,862
He's my second son, Junji.

129
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:37,862
He's a good-for-nothing that's just loafing around.

130
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:39,762
"Junji Kumado (28), second son"

131
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:41,762
I guess I can't retort.

132
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:45,862
And Shuko, Soichi's wife and Kazuma,

133
00:08:45,863 --> 00:08:47,962
makes all six of you living here together.

134
00:08:47,963 --> 00:08:50,762
Never mind that. Didn't you lock the house?

135
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,463
I did, but still...

136
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:56,962
At around 1:00 after putting Kazuma to sleep,

137
00:08:56,963 --> 00:08:59,063
I came back to this living room and was suddenly...

138
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:09,863
Kazuma!

139
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:15,263
When I came to, I was tied up.

140
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:18,862
And I called the police on my cell phone.

141
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:21,763
So? When you realized it, it was already stolen?

142
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,862
Yes.

143
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:28,462
It seems that the incense burner was the only thing that was stolen.

144
00:09:28,463 --> 00:09:32,262
The perp was only after that incense burner to begin with.

145
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:34,862
That's what's so strange.

146
00:09:34,863 --> 00:09:38,562
It was placed where anybody could see it, right?

147
00:09:38,563 --> 00:09:41,362
All that needed to be done was to make off with it right away,

148
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:44,862
so there was no need to tie Shuko up, was there?

149
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:48,863
And yet, I wonder why the perp went out of the way to tie you up?

150
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:52,062
I have no idea.

151
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:54,762
How are we supposed to know why the perp did what he did?

152
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:56,663
Brat, keep out of this!

153
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:00,962
Talk about a scary gramps...

154
00:10:00,963 --> 00:10:03,462
Any idea on who the perp might be?

155
00:10:03,463 --> 00:10:05,662
According to forensics, there are no traces of

156
00:10:05,663 --> 00:10:08,862
the door in the front or back being forced opened.

157
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:12,562
Maybe the perp broke in using a spare key.

158
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:13,862
Spare key?

159
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,962
The perp was someone who was able to get that ready.

160
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:19,462
And this was found by the sofa.

161
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:22,862
It wasn't there when Shuko cleaned the room this morning,

162
00:10:22,863 --> 00:10:25,862
so it could've been left behind by the perp.

163
00:10:25,863 --> 00:10:28,562
I was a bit concerned.

164
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:33,662
Father, wasn't Naomi wearing a similar looking pendant yesterday?

165
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:35,062
Naomi was?

166
00:10:35,063 --> 00:10:37,662
She was. I think it was yesterday.

167
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:39,262
Now that you mentioned it...

168
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,962
I remember, too.

169
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:44,462
Who is she, this person called Naomi?

170
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:46,162
Naomi Senda.

171
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:49,862
She was working as our housekeeper two years ago.

172
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:52,862
She suddenly came here from Tokyo yesterday

173
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:55,362
to ask if she could borrow money.

174
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,762
But Dad refused.

175
00:10:57,763 --> 00:10:59,162
Why should I lend her money?

176
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:01,262
That ungrateful swine stole money from this house

177
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:02,662
when she quit and took off.

178
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,762
She stole money from you and split?

179
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:08,062
I didn't file a report because I thought it was a shame.

180
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:09,462
You mean she stole the household treasure

181
00:11:09,463 --> 00:11:11,862
because you didn't let her borrow money.

182
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:15,262
That wench would do something like that!

183
00:11:15,263 --> 00:11:17,162
If she used to work here as a housekeeper before...

184
00:11:17,163 --> 00:11:20,162
She could've made a spare key while she was working here.

185
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:23,362
And where is she, this person called Naomi Senda?

186
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:25,663
I have her cell phone number.

187
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:38,011
What?

188
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:42,012
"Naomi Senda (30), former housekeeper" -This is Ms. Naomi Senda?

189
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:43,721
This is...

190
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:45,521
You lewd mustache jerk!

191
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:48,721
You were attacked by the robber at around 1:00?

192
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:50,721
No mistake about it.

193
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:52,721
Then, she's innocent

194
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:56,121
because just around that time we ran into her at the sand dune.

195
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:58,721
So, like I said, I know nothing about it.

196
00:11:58,722 --> 00:12:00,921
But this...

197
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:03,121
I dropped it when I came here yesterday.

198
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,521
But when I cleaned the house this morning, it wasn't there.

199
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:07,521
How dare you lie like that?

200
00:12:07,522 --> 00:12:09,521
-I tell you, stop lying! -Stop it!

201
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:11,021
Cut it out!

202
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,822
-Let go, I said! Get away from her! -Stop it!

203
00:12:14,822 --> 00:12:16,421
Are you all right?

204
00:12:16,422 --> 00:12:18,222
I'm not lying.

205
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:23,921
Yes?

206
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:25,221
A delivery?

207
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:26,321
I'll be right out.

208
00:12:26,322 --> 00:12:28,222
No, I'll go.

209
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:39,922
Soichi, it's for you.

210
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:43,821
You never did like me.

211
00:12:43,822 --> 00:12:45,721
That's why you're trying to frame me.

212
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:46,921
I would never.

213
00:12:46,922 --> 00:12:50,821
Thanks all for ganging up and suspecting me!

214
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:52,621
I'll pay you back for all of this,

215
00:12:52,622 --> 00:12:55,522
so just you wait and see.

216
00:13:01,422 --> 00:13:04,821
I... I'm going to be killed by her.

217
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:06,021
What?

218
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:07,621
Don't exaggerate.

219
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:11,122
It's all because your remarks are so irresponsible to begin with!

220
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:24,322
This is where the real game starts.

221
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:27,721
About that person called Naomi Senda...

222
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:31,221
She's a violent wench, but she has an alibi

223
00:13:31,222 --> 00:13:32,821
so has nothing to do with the crime!

224
00:13:32,822 --> 00:13:35,221
Then, what about her pendant that was found on the floor?

225
00:13:35,222 --> 00:13:36,922
That...

226
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,721
Quit asking for instructions on petty details!

227
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:47,222
What do you think you're getting paid for?

228
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:51,121
I got mail.

229
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,022
"From: Masked Pickled Shallot" -What, "Masked Shallot"?

230
00:13:54,722 --> 00:13:57,321
It's from the perp!

231
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:59,821
"If you want the household treasure incense burner back,

232
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:03,421
get 10 million yen ready. I'll contact you tomorrow."

233
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:06,521
I thought you said that the incense burner was valued at 1 million yen.

234
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:08,421
That's also not the whole truth.

235
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:11,521
It's only worth at most 100,000 yen.

236
00:14:11,522 --> 00:14:14,221
But it's been the token of the head of the household

237
00:14:14,222 --> 00:14:15,621
of the Kumado family for generations.

238
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:18,121
It's invaluable!

239
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:20,821
Get 10 million yen ready by first thing tomorrow morning.

240
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:21,822
Yes, sir!

241
00:14:21,823 --> 00:14:24,421
I see.

242
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:26,621
Will you all tell me what you were doing

243
00:14:26,622 --> 00:14:30,321
and where you were around the time the crime took place?

244
00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:33,421
What? Are you suspecting the people of this family?

245
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:34,921
Although the cash value of it is not much,

246
00:14:34,922 --> 00:14:37,221
a great sum of money can be blackmailed.

247
00:14:37,222 --> 00:14:39,021
The only ones who know of something like this

248
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:41,221
are the ones on the inside, correct?

249
00:14:41,222 --> 00:14:45,321
And what's stranger is that unexplainable pendant.

250
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:47,721
The perp had kept the pendant

251
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:50,021
that Ms. Naomi Senda had dropped the other day.

252
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,621
And today, the perp snuck into the house,

253
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:56,121
robbed it and dropped the pendant

254
00:14:56,122 --> 00:14:59,721
to make it look as if Ms. Naomi Senda committed the crime!

255
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:02,021
You would do it. Sis, wouldn't you?

256
00:15:02,022 --> 00:15:04,721
Talk for yourself. I'll bet you needed money to loaf around!

257
00:15:04,722 --> 00:15:06,821
If you're referring to money, you can't use freely,

258
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,021
the same goes for both of you, no?

259
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:12,421
Even so, why would I do something like that?

260
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:14,921
All three of you are starved for money.

261
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:16,421
Cut it out!

262
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:18,021
What privilege does a detective have

263
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:19,821
to butt his nose into our business to begin with?

264
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:23,021
I just want to help in solving the case.

265
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,521
But is it inconvenient for you?

266
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:29,221
Don't tell me that you suspect me, too?

267
00:15:29,222 --> 00:15:33,121
Your circumstances are no different from these three, you see.

268
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:35,821
You're to blame for all this because you're such an idiot!

269
00:15:35,822 --> 00:15:38,521
Thanks to you, I have to go through the trouble of being suspected!

270
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:41,621
What a jinx you brought home.

271
00:15:41,622 --> 00:15:43,121
What a thing to say.

272
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:45,021
Shuko's a victim, you know.

273
00:15:45,022 --> 00:15:46,822
So what!

274
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:50,521
Nothing.

275
00:15:50,522 --> 00:15:52,022
I'll go prepare some tea.

276
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:55,721
Your role as a bride ended

277
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:58,422
since you given birth to Kazuma, heir to this family.

278
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,021
It must be rough.

279
00:16:05,022 --> 00:16:07,721
Feeling like you don't belong here.

280
00:16:07,722 --> 00:16:10,821
But I can't leave

281
00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:14,721
because Father has his mind set on making Kazuma his heir.

282
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:18,521
I know he'd never let Kazuma go, no matter what.

283
00:16:18,522 --> 00:16:21,121
If the alternative is to be torn away from Kazuma,

284
00:16:21,122 --> 00:16:25,421
I've no choice but to stay here with the Kumado family.

285
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:27,321
Maybe, but...

286
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:31,021
Everyone has their own reasons.

287
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:32,921
And what a detective can do is

288
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:35,921
to find the robber, solve the case

289
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:39,822
and give Shuko some relief from being blamed.

290
00:16:41,622 --> 00:16:43,021
Mr. Mouri...

291
00:16:43,022 --> 00:16:45,022
Right.

292
00:16:49,222 --> 00:16:51,121
"Daigakuin" -Then, the head of the household

293
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:55,121
came here to Daigakuin just around noon yesterday.

294
00:16:55,122 --> 00:16:58,021
This is the grave of Tadayoshi Satomi, etc.

295
00:16:58,022 --> 00:17:00,721
Who "The Eight Dog Chronicles" was modeled after.

296
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:05,621
He offers his services to the annual festivals associated with this

297
00:17:05,622 --> 00:17:08,221
and came to chat over tea.

298
00:17:08,222 --> 00:17:11,421
He was here for about 30 minutes.

299
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:13,521
Till about 12:30...

300
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:14,921
After that?

301
00:17:14,922 --> 00:17:18,021
He mentioned looking in on the Akagawara Building 10.

302
00:17:18,022 --> 00:17:19,121
"Akagwara building 10."

303
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:22,321
He came around 1:30?

304
00:17:22,322 --> 00:17:24,021
Yes, I think so.

305
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:26,121
He came to offer advice on our merchandise.

306
00:17:26,122 --> 00:17:29,022
He's passionate about revitalizing local business, you see.

307
00:17:30,322 --> 00:17:33,321
His crucial alibi for the time around 1:00 is missing.

308
00:17:33,322 --> 00:17:36,322
And his residence is just a stone's throw away.

309
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,821
"Special Express Yakumo."

310
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:40,822
"Yonago Station."

311
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:42,421
"Tottori Prefectural Flower Park."

312
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:44,221
She's an acquaintance of my older sister.

313
00:17:44,222 --> 00:17:45,821
Ms. Makie Kumado.

314
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:48,721
That's why you know what she looks like.

315
00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:51,121
She entered the park around 11:00

316
00:17:51,122 --> 00:17:54,321
and left at around 3:00.

317
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:56,721
Which means, just as she was saying at around 1:00,

318
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:59,221
she was somewhere inside this Flower Park.

319
00:17:59,222 --> 00:18:03,921
If she was really there, all the way from 11:00 to 3:00.

320
00:18:03,922 --> 00:18:05,821
True.

321
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:07,421
"Kaike Hot Springs" -It was true too,

322
00:18:07,422 --> 00:18:09,121
that the second son Junji was also here

323
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:11,821
from the night before spending the night over at Kaike Hot Springs.

324
00:18:11,822 --> 00:18:14,921
The point is where he was yesterday morning

325
00:18:14,922 --> 00:18:17,021
after he checked out of the inn.

326
00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:18,721
"Yonago City Tourist Center" -He said that he stuck around here,

327
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,022
and also have people who can prove that too, but...

328
00:18:22,222 --> 00:18:24,721
It's this guy from yesterday.

329
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:27,122
No doubt about it, it's this guy.

330
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:30,222
Watch out!

331
00:18:31,122 --> 00:18:34,121
But that was about 3:00.

332
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:36,022
So, it's the same as Makie.

333
00:18:36,622 --> 00:18:38,021
"Misasa Hot Spring" -So, their alibis...

334
00:18:38,022 --> 00:18:39,821
are missing a chunk in the middle.

335
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:44,321
Yeah. Neither of them have alibis for around 1:00,

336
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:46,021
but I don't think they could've gone home once

337
00:18:46,022 --> 00:18:49,821
and return to where they were before.

338
00:18:49,822 --> 00:18:52,921
It takes 30 minutes on the Limited Express from Yonago

339
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:56,121
where Kaike Hot Springs and the Flower Park are to Kurayoshi.

340
00:18:56,122 --> 00:18:58,921
Which means all three aren't completely cleared yet.

341
00:18:58,922 --> 00:19:00,921
You mean the head of the household, too?

342
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:02,821
Since he's locally an influential figure,

343
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:04,921
he's been visiting around here and there,

344
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:06,821
but all those places are near his residence.

345
00:19:06,822 --> 00:19:09,721
If he wanted to, he could've.

346
00:19:09,722 --> 00:19:13,421
The only one remaining is Shuko's husband, Soichi.

347
00:19:13,422 --> 00:19:16,121
"Jinjo no Yakjata" -Isn't that the place he was talking about?

348
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,221
Yes, Soichi dropped by

349
00:19:18,222 --> 00:19:21,922
saying he happened to be nearby around 1:00 yesterday.

350
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:26,421
He has a definite alibi.

351
00:19:26,422 --> 00:19:29,121
It'd be too painful if her husband were the robber.

352
00:19:29,122 --> 00:19:32,621
Come off it, you've got yourself all mixed up.

353
00:19:32,622 --> 00:19:34,221
Yesterday at around 1:00,

354
00:19:34,222 --> 00:19:38,222
you were eating Ra-don Noodles with me, weren't you, Tanaka?

355
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:42,722
Well, you see Soichi asked me to do him a favor this morning.

356
00:19:43,522 --> 00:19:46,021
I'm being suspected of something by a detective.

357
00:19:46,022 --> 00:19:48,921
But I don't have an alibi.

358
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,422
So, please help me, Tanaka. Please!

359
00:19:57,622 --> 00:20:00,721
Why aren't they contacting us?

360
00:20:00,722 --> 00:20:04,321
I'm sure the perp can't make a move.

361
00:20:04,322 --> 00:20:06,021
Since the police are on their guard waiting

362
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:08,521
to arrest the perp during the exchange,

363
00:20:08,522 --> 00:20:11,121
and moreover, even a detective's come to help out.

364
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:14,421
You insist that the perp is among one of us, then.

365
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,921
More so, since a person who had asked someone

366
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:18,521
to make a false statement for him is here.

367
00:20:18,522 --> 00:20:22,221
Can't you recall anything about the perp?

368
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,221
He's back.

369
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:26,621
What're you talking about?

370
00:20:26,622 --> 00:20:28,621
Nothing.

371
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:30,521
Dr. Yasunobu Kotani who died of

372
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:34,121
an accident in South Africa earlier this month,

373
00:20:34,122 --> 00:20:37,321
have returned to Japan today.

374
00:20:37,322 --> 00:20:42,321
Dr. Kotani is from the Tottori Prefecture.

375
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:46,021
That doctor who has been performing medical activities abroad.

376
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:48,321
He was from Tottori?

377
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:50,421
Do you know him, Shuko?

378
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:52,721
What?

379
00:20:52,722 --> 00:20:54,721
We used to be classmates in intermediate school.

380
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:57,822
Who cares, at a time like this!

381
00:21:00,522 --> 00:21:01,921
Kumado here.

382
00:21:01,922 --> 00:21:04,621
Thanks for having me yesterday. This is Naomi.

383
00:21:04,622 --> 00:21:06,622
May I speak to Shuko, please?

384
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:10,221
This is Shuko.

385
00:21:10,222 --> 00:21:13,121
When you try to frame people, I'll show you what it's like.

386
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:15,622
You'll see hell.

387
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:22,321
Why's she doing this?

388
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,621
If you want, I could serve as your bodyguard.

389
00:21:24,622 --> 00:21:26,021
What?

390
00:21:26,022 --> 00:21:28,821
No, I think she's just harassing me.

391
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:31,921
Well, if you say it's unnecessary.

392
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:35,922
I wonder if she really has nothing to do with the case?

393
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,521
But she has an alibi.

394
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:41,221
Didn't her alibi sound sort of unnatural?

395
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:44,921
Heck. I wasted my time and money.

396
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:47,622
It's late. That clock.

397
00:21:48,422 --> 00:21:49,921
Now that you mentioned it...

398
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:51,522
It's just a coincidence.

399
00:21:58,022 --> 00:22:00,522
When I got up this morning, I found this at the front door.

400
00:22:01,722 --> 00:22:04,821
It's been returned.

401
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:06,721
What's going on?

402
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:08,621
Why did the perp return the incense burner

403
00:22:08,622 --> 00:22:10,722
without even taking the money?

404
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:23,222
This case is probably not a mere robbery case!

405
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:47,621
"Next Episode" -Therefore, the perp is among you.

406
00:23:47,622 --> 00:23:50,421
Well, since this was returned,

407
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:53,021
who cares at this point, who the perp is.

408
00:23:53,022 --> 00:23:56,921
I wonder why the perp returned the incense burner?

409
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:59,821
Wait a sec. This robbery case...

410
00:23:59,822 --> 00:24:01,721
Don't tell me...

411
00:24:01,722 --> 00:24:03,921
What? She went to see Naomi Senda?

412
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:05,122
Oh, no!

413
00:24:08,122 --> 00:24:09,321
