1
00:00:02,445 --> 00:00:06,245
We coincidentally ran into Inspector Shiratori at the movie theater

2
00:00:06,245 --> 00:00:07,445
and heard of his memory

3
00:00:07,445 --> 00:00:09,345
of a fateful encounter with a girl during his childhood,

4
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:11,845
who he thought was Officer Sato,

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,345
that triggered his desire to become a police officer.

6
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:17,845
The woman that.

7
00:00:17,845 --> 00:00:19,345
"Nami Kasakura (27)" -he gets to know at the theater

8
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:20,945
named Ms. Nami Kasakura,

9
00:00:20,945 --> 00:00:22,945
like the girl in his memory,

10
00:00:22,945 --> 00:00:25,445
decorated the cup of coke with a strip of paper flower

11
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:28,245
that she made out of the wrapper of a straw.

12
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:31,845
Could it be that Nami is the girl in his memory?

13
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:35,945
Hearing that Nami was troubled by a stalker,

14
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:39,945
we went to visit her condo along with Inspector Shiratori,

15
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:42,545
and found her boyfriend Mr. Yoshiro Somei,

16
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:47,145
killed by someone and lying dead.

17
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:49,345
Did the stalker commit the crime?

18
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:52,645
Or did Nami commit the crime

19
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:55,045
making it look like the work of a stalker?

20
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:57,945
But, her alibi was proven by none other than.

21
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:01,045
Inspector Shiratori and ourselves.

22
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:03,345
If she is the one who did it,

23
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:05,845
what kind of trick did she use to commit the crime?

24
00:01:08,645 --> 00:01:10,645
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

25
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:12,445
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

26
00:01:12,445 --> 00:01:13,445
Encounter and goodbye,

27
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:14,645
the season of cherry blossoms.

28
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:16,845
Inspector Shiratori is about to fall in love.

29
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:18,545
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,545
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:22,445
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

32
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:06,504
"Inspector Shiratori Cherry Blossom Memory (Part 2)".

33
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:13,804
We verified Ms. Kasakura's alibi,

34
00:03:13,804 --> 00:03:15,404
and although we looked inside the room,

35
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:19,004
no wiretap or camera was found.

36
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:22,704
No traces of a stalker having been in the room were found, but...

37
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:27,804
Takagi is speaking.

38
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:29,104
Did you find anything?

39
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:31,504
Well, the thing is,

40
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:33,404
there seems to have been quite a lot of people who left the theater

41
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:35,104
during the movie to go to the restroom.

42
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:38,904
Nobody seems to remember who went in and out.

43
00:03:38,904 --> 00:03:41,104
Today is Sunday and it's really crowded,

44
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:42,704
so I think that's to be expected.

45
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:44,004
I see.

46
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:47,504
-Takagi. -Hey.

47
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:49,604
There's a trash can on that floor, isn't there?

48
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:53,804
Yes, although they're about to dispose of what's inside right now.

49
00:03:53,804 --> 00:03:56,404
Then, go tell them that you're a police officer

50
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,704
and retrieve it, won't you?

51
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:00,804
There should be a cup that is wrapped with

52
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:02,904
a strip of paper shaped in flowers made of the wrapper of a straw

53
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:04,104
inside the trash.

54
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:07,704
A strip of paper flowers made out of the wrapper of a straw?

55
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:10,604
I found it!

56
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:13,804
Will you take that to forensics?

57
00:04:13,804 --> 00:04:15,104
Just to be safe,

58
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:17,804
take the other cups inside the bag together with it too.

59
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:20,604
Check the fingerprints on the cup

60
00:04:20,604 --> 00:04:22,404
and substance inside the drink of the cup.

61
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:24,704
-Yes, sir. -And...

62
00:04:26,104 --> 00:04:27,204
And?

63
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:33,404
And...

64
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,004
No, that'll be all.

65
00:04:44,504 --> 00:04:47,504
Let me know as soon as you get the results.

66
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:52,804
I'm sorry that I asked him to do things for me without asking you first.

67
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:55,004
No problem.

68
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:30,804
Hey.

69
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:37,004
Why didn't you ask about the wrapper of the straw?

70
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,904
It could've served as conclusive evidence, and yet...

71
00:05:42,804 --> 00:05:44,104
Just what're you talking about?

72
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:46,404
Don't tell me it's because she's beautiful

73
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:49,304
and you finally got to know her.

74
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:52,104
I sure hope you're not going to say something dopey like that.

75
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:55,804
Personal emotions are to be left out when investigating,

76
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:59,304
right, Inspector Shiratori?

77
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:07,604
Indeed.

78
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,304
Exactly.

79
00:06:14,904 --> 00:06:18,404
Buy a drink at this store?

80
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:20,904
I'm not thirsty, though.

81
00:06:20,904 --> 00:06:23,004
Never mind, just buy one

82
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:25,404
and do as I say from now.

83
00:06:25,404 --> 00:06:26,604
Hey.

84
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:29,504
I've figured out

85
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:33,504
the reason why Inspector Shiratori hesitated.

86
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:42,704
I measured it as you told me to.

87
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:45,504
And? How long is it?

88
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:47,604
Isn't it a bit short?

89
00:06:47,604 --> 00:06:50,904
No, it was exactly the same.

90
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:55,804
I see.

91
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:58,804
So, it was the same,

92
00:06:58,804 --> 00:07:01,604
It seems he got the answer he was looking for.

93
00:07:01,604 --> 00:07:03,504
Yeah.

94
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:08,004
The answer to a sad result.

95
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:10,504
But the cherry blossom mark

96
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:13,004
is what all police officers have on them!

97
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:15,604
It's strong, kind and awesome,

98
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:17,804
a flower of justice!

99
00:07:23,404 --> 00:07:26,504
Taking into consideration Ms. Kasakura's testimony...

100
00:07:26,504 --> 00:07:31,504
While she was watching a movie at the theater today,

101
00:07:31,504 --> 00:07:34,404
the stalker came into this room,

102
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:37,104
and killed Mr. Yoshiro Somei

103
00:07:37,104 --> 00:07:40,104
who was waiting in her room for her to come home.

104
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:44,504
I guess there's no doubt that he fled the scene after that.

105
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:46,304
I can't really come to any conclusion

106
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:49,204
unless we question the people in this vicinity.

107
00:07:49,204 --> 00:07:51,304
What about the children?

108
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:54,004
I've asked the elementary school teacher

109
00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:57,004
to come pick them up.

110
00:07:57,004 --> 00:08:00,204
Since both Dr. Agasa and Mr. Mouri weren't home.

111
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:04,404
Do you still have something you want to confirm with the children about?

112
00:08:04,404 --> 00:08:06,104
No.

113
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:08,204
Inspector Shiratori.

114
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:12,204
Well, then, Ms. Kasakura,

115
00:08:12,204 --> 00:08:14,104
please come to the station with me,

116
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:16,104
so that I can ask you some questions on the case.

117
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:21,004
But could I be given permission to spend some time alone?

118
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:24,904
I'm quite shocked over his death, you see.

119
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,704
I guess so.

120
00:08:26,704 --> 00:08:28,504
Then, after you've gotten yourself together again,

121
00:08:28,504 --> 00:08:30,304
-I'll send one of my men over to pick you up... -No.

122
00:08:30,304 --> 00:08:33,604
Please have her come to the station right away.

123
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:36,604
Not as a material witness,

124
00:08:36,604 --> 00:08:39,404
but as a suspect of this homicide case.

125
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:48,427
The one who murdered Mr. Yoshiro Somei in this room...

126
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,727
is you, isn't it, Ms. Nami Kasakura?

127
00:08:56,927 --> 00:09:00,127
Hey, hey. Just what're you talking about?

128
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:02,727
From the estimated time of death of the victim,

129
00:09:02,727 --> 00:09:06,027
the crime was around 14:00 today.

130
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:10,327
At that time, Ms. Kasakura was seated in the theatre next to you

131
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:13,227
watching the movie, isn't that what you said?

132
00:09:13,227 --> 00:09:16,027
Moreover, the victim had called Ms. Kasahara on her cell phone

133
00:09:16,027 --> 00:09:19,127
just before he was murdered.

134
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:21,127
And the children who were sitting behind you

135
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:25,027
saw that she received the call, you know?

136
00:09:25,027 --> 00:09:27,827
Yeah! We saw it. It was pitch dark,

137
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:30,727
but there was a flash of light in the seat in front and it got bright.

138
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:33,927
I saw that lady who was wearing a hat.

139
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:37,727
That flash of light meant that she received a call.

140
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:41,127
Right? Conan, you saw it with Ai too, didn't you?

141
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:42,227
Yeah.

142
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:43,727
I did see it.

143
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:47,727
The knitted hat that she was wearing.

144
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:53,527
Right. It's not that we saw her in person.

145
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:54,627
What we saw

146
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,627
was the person who was made to wear the hat

147
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:59,027
and was shined on by the light of the cell phone.

148
00:09:59,027 --> 00:10:02,227
The person who emerged in the dark.

149
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:05,027
In other words, what we saw was the silhouette of Inspector Shiratori

150
00:10:05,027 --> 00:10:07,527
who was sitting in the seat next to her.

151
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:11,027
That's right, isn't it, Inspector Shiratori?

152
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,127
Yeah.

153
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:15,427
But, even if the cell phone emitted light,

154
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:18,727
if it's not near the face, isn't it hard to see it?

155
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:21,627
It was on top the cup of coke.

156
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:25,627
If the cell phone is placed opened on the cup, then...

157
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,927
it would be the same distance as

158
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:31,727
when you pick it up by hand, when it shines.

159
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:35,427
Of course, the vibe and ringtone were both switched off.

160
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,027
But if so, wouldn't the people in the surrounding seats

161
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:40,227
think that something funny is happening?

162
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:42,627
If there were people right near our seats,

163
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:45,127
then maybe they would have doubts,

164
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:47,627
but the aisle was behind our seats

165
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:49,627
and the seats to both of our sides were empty.

166
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:50,727
It is highly possible.

167
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:56,727
Ms. Kasahara also bought the tickets for both the seats on the internet.

168
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:58,627
Sitting just one seat away,

169
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:02,627
it is virtually impossible to see what anyone is doing in the dark.

170
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:08,527
Which means that you just happened to buy

171
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:10,927
the seat beside her that she didn't buy?

172
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:12,127
Yes.

173
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:14,327
Even if I didn't buy it,

174
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:15,327
since it's the seat of a movie that is popular

175
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,427
and more so, it being Sunday,

176
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,827
the seat would've eventually been taken by someone right away.

177
00:11:19,827 --> 00:11:23,027
If the ticket is bought on the internet,

178
00:11:23,027 --> 00:11:24,227
it's possible to see on screen

179
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:25,827
the number of seats that are already taken.

180
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:27,627
Ms. Kasakura who saw that the five seats

181
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:28,927
behind the seats that she had purchased were taken,

182
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:32,027
in order to verify that the seats belonged to the children,

183
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:33,927
were watching them from near the ticket vending machine

184
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,827
before the movie started.

185
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:37,427
Then, she deliberately pretended to forget her wallet

186
00:11:37,427 --> 00:11:38,927
in front of the children.

187
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:40,227
After making sure that the children sees her wallet,

188
00:11:40,227 --> 00:11:42,127
she befriends them.

189
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:44,727
Then after watching the movie,

190
00:11:44,727 --> 00:11:46,227
she takes the children with her to her condo,

191
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:48,527
and pretends to find the dead body together with the children.

192
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:51,727
She probably wanted the children to prove her alibi.

193
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:55,527
No way.

194
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:59,627
I'm pretty sure that after finding out I was a police detective,

195
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:04,027
she decided that taking me along with everyone would clear things faster.

196
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:06,627
Hey, just what do you think you're saying?

197
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:12,327
But, unless you happened to fall asleep like you did,

198
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:14,027
she couldn't have committed the crime.

199
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:16,927
I just did not happen to.

200
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:20,627
It's most likely that in the cup of coke I drank from,

201
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:23,827
she poured in some sleeping drug or something.

202
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,527
Sleeping drug?

203
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:28,127
The thing is, before I went to my seat...

204
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:29,727
Seeing me searching for my seat

205
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:32,127
while looking at the half portion of my ticket,

206
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,127
after confirming that I was going to be the one sitting next to her

207
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:37,127
that she was going to place the hat on,

208
00:12:37,127 --> 00:12:38,927
she deliberately bumped into me,

209
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:41,027
and spilled my coke.

210
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,427
She put the sleeping drug inside the cup that she brought back to me

211
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:45,727
in exchange for the coke she had spilled, and gave it to me.

212
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:47,627
Of course,

213
00:12:47,627 --> 00:12:49,027
you can never tell if the sleeping drug would be effective

214
00:12:49,027 --> 00:12:50,327
in a short amount of time

215
00:12:50,327 --> 00:12:52,327
because that differs from person to person.

216
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:55,027
But if she were trying it over and over,

217
00:12:55,027 --> 00:12:56,327
she would eventually run into someone like me

218
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:59,327
who would fall asleep completely.

219
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:03,027
Well, I guess we can figure that out by looking at

220
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:04,727
the history of the tickets she purchased.

221
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:07,327
We would probably find that she bought tickets

222
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:09,027
for the three seats in question

223
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:12,427
at the movie time on Saturday that is most crowded.

224
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:13,927
If not,

225
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:17,027
there is no way she would know in such detail

226
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:20,127
about the contents of the movie that she didn't get to see today.

227
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:22,327
Today is the first time I saw the movie!

228
00:13:22,327 --> 00:13:24,627
The seat I bought for before was for a friend!

229
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:26,027
I invited the friend to come many times

230
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:28,427
but was turned down because something else came up.

231
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:31,527
Right! Please check if there is any sleeping drug

232
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:33,127
inside your coke cup.

233
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:36,927
It should be easy because your cup has something on it.

234
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:41,627
Are you referring to this flower?

235
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:44,027
The strip of flower you made

236
00:13:44,027 --> 00:13:47,327
out of the paper straw wrapper that you stuck on my cup.

237
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,727
In fact, I tore one off

238
00:13:50,727 --> 00:13:54,527
and have it stuck between the page of my notebook to remember you by.

239
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:57,327
So, if we check my cup that I threw away

240
00:13:57,327 --> 00:13:59,727
into the trash box of the theater...

241
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:02,627
Here it is.

242
00:14:02,627 --> 00:14:05,527
Then, please tell us about

243
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:07,827
the length of the strip of flower once again.

244
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:09,027
Yes, sir.

245
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:12,527
The length of the strip of flower

246
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:15,927
and a brand new straw wrapper was the same.

247
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:18,027
The same?

248
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:19,427
Strange.

249
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:22,127
Since Inspector Shiratori had torn off a piece,

250
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,127
it should be a bit short.

251
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:25,727
That's because...

252
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:28,927
When you left the theater once,

253
00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:32,327
you took the cup with the sleeping drug inside it with you,

254
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:33,727
and when you came back in again,

255
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,927
you pasted a new strip of flowers onto the new cup.

256
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:40,427
So, she presumed that she would be investigated on it later.

257
00:14:40,427 --> 00:14:42,027
Yes.

258
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:44,327
In other words, the crime was committed this way...

259
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:45,527
First, she becomes friendly with someone

260
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:46,727
who has come to watch the movie before it starts

261
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:49,427
in order to get herself an alibi.

262
00:14:49,427 --> 00:14:50,727
She inserts a sleeping drug into the cup

263
00:14:50,727 --> 00:14:53,027
of the person who sits next to her.

264
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:56,227
After confirming that the person had fallen asleep,

265
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:58,227
she places her hat on that person's head

266
00:14:58,227 --> 00:15:00,027
then switches her cup

267
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:02,127
with the one the sleeping drug is inside,

268
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:04,627
and places the cell phone on the cup.

269
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:06,727
She takes the cup with the sleeping drug inside

270
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:09,227
out of the theater when she sneaks out.

271
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:12,127
She returns home on a cab,

272
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,227
and strikes Mr. Somei who is waiting there to death.

273
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:16,427
Right after that,

274
00:15:16,427 --> 00:15:17,927
she call her own cell phone

275
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:19,127
that she had left behind at the theater,

276
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,427
using Mr. Somei's phone.

277
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:23,027
Then she makes the people

278
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:25,727
who will establish her alibi watch this

279
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:27,727
so that they will testify for her.

280
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,027
Then all she has left to do is to dispose of the cup

281
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:31,827
with the sleeping drug inside it and the murder weapon somewhere,

282
00:15:31,827 --> 00:15:33,727
go back to the theater by cab,

283
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:36,327
take her hat off the person who is sitting next to her

284
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:38,227
and switch the cup that has her cell phone on it

285
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:42,227
with a new cup with the strip of flower on it.

286
00:15:43,427 --> 00:15:47,227
She went out of the way to stick a new strip of flowers on the cup

287
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:49,927
because I tore the strip of flower off

288
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:52,827
not from the edge, but from part way.

289
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:56,527
It's most likely that she mistakenly thought that

290
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:59,127
she had torn off a part of the strip when she was sticking it on.

291
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:00,527
If she left it cut off as is,

292
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:01,627
when she is investigated,

293
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,527
it would disclose that the cup had been switched.

294
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:07,827
That's probably why she stuck a new strip on.

295
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:10,427
What's the big fuss about a measly strip of flower?

296
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,427
If you want to set me up as a criminal,

297
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:14,827
why don't you bring the cab driver

298
00:16:14,827 --> 00:16:17,427
who drove me over here right this minute?

299
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:20,227
I'm sure they'll find that driver soon.

300
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:22,427
Because there's no doubt

301
00:16:22,427 --> 00:16:27,227
that you rode a cab while the movie was playing.

302
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:28,927
I mean, you didn't know

303
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:32,127
that there was an earthquake during the movie, right?

304
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:33,927
Earthquake?

305
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,227
There was one, wasn't there?

306
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,127
Yeah! A pretty big one too.

307
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:41,327
It was right after the scene where Gomera's organs came in view.

308
00:16:41,327 --> 00:16:44,227
I was so scared, I clinged on tight to Conan!

309
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:47,627
Well, it's no surprise if you were riding a car

310
00:16:47,627 --> 00:16:50,227
and didn't notice the earthquake, though.

311
00:16:50,227 --> 00:16:52,927
I... I just forgot to mention it!

312
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:56,027
Because I was upset over his death.

313
00:16:57,127 --> 00:17:00,027
What? What's with all of you?

314
00:17:00,027 --> 00:17:03,227
Why this sudden change in attitude?

315
00:17:03,227 --> 00:17:06,627
Even you stood up for me in the beginning!

316
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:08,027
Hey!

317
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:12,727
When Inspector Megure asked me

318
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:15,327
about your alibi a while ago...

319
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:16,527
No.

320
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:20,327
I seem to have been sleeping just then.

321
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:22,027
I found the yarn from your hat on my hand

322
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:25,527
after I scratched my head.

323
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:29,527
That's why there's a high possibility

324
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:32,627
that you'll find my hair

325
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:34,927
on the inside of your hat.

326
00:17:44,227 --> 00:17:45,227
Is that so?

327
00:17:47,427 --> 00:17:48,527
Go ahead.

328
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:50,527
Then...

329
00:17:55,127 --> 00:17:57,327
Go ahead and check it if you want to!

330
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,027
I'm sure you'll find what you want.

331
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:04,327
The frizzy hair of that police detective that puts on airs!

332
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:08,227
You admit that you committed the crime, then?

333
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:11,927
Yes, I killed him!

334
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:14,927
That revolting swindler!

335
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,027
Swindler?

336
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:21,427
I started going with that guy seven years ago.

337
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:23,827
When I was 20.

338
00:18:23,827 --> 00:18:27,627
That guy was always in need of money

339
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:31,127
and who knows how much I gave him.

340
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:34,627
When I told him I had no more money I could give him,

341
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:35,827
he started saying that he wanted to

342
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:38,327
take the accessory I had to the pawn shop.

343
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:40,727
I gave it to him once,

344
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:42,327
but since it was my mother's keepsake,

345
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:44,627
I went to the pawn shop to get it back,

346
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:48,427
but was told that no one turned something like that in.

347
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:52,027
I got suspicious and followed him.

348
00:18:52,027 --> 00:18:55,527
And that's when I saw.

349
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:59,927
A woman wearing the ring that was my mother's keepsake.

350
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:03,427
I found out later that she had been going with him from two years

351
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:05,027
before I even met him,

352
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:09,027
and that she was engaged to him too.

353
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:12,327
Why didn't you report it to the police?

354
00:19:12,327 --> 00:19:15,627
That's indeed a case of swindling.

355
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:19,627
Telling the police would only get that guy arrested.

356
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:23,127
I won't get back the seven years that I lost.

357
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:27,327
That's why I put an end to that guy's life!

358
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:30,127
As punishment for wasting seven years of my young and beautiful life,

359
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,527
as well as spending all my cash!

360
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:38,727
Well, I never thought that the police was of any good,

361
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:41,427
so I figured I had to do it myself.

362
00:19:44,927 --> 00:19:47,927
Okay, let's go.

363
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:49,527
It's too bad.

364
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:56,627
You were not like that before.

365
00:19:56,627 --> 00:20:00,527
Huh? Did you know me before?

366
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:04,727
Yes. I doubt you remember, though.

367
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:14,127
Let me tell you then.

368
00:20:14,127 --> 00:20:18,427
It's a man's ego that makes them think that women don't change!

369
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,627
But, we do. Depending on what happens,

370
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:24,327
we go from angels to devils!

371
00:20:26,427 --> 00:20:29,527
Like they say, a woman's heart is as changeable as the autumn sky!

372
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,527
That lady is really cruel.

373
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,027
She really went overboard.

374
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,927
What's an ego?

375
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:41,927
It's being selfishly one-track minded.

376
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:49,627
Are you all right?

377
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:52,927
Inspector Shiratori has so many things going on at once.

378
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:56,227
Hey, do you want me to go call Officer Sato?

379
00:20:56,227 --> 00:20:58,427
I know her phone number.

380
00:20:58,427 --> 00:21:01,527
No, please don't do that.

381
00:21:04,427 --> 00:21:07,127
Never mind. Just leave me alone.

382
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:08,827
Here you go.

383
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:10,027
Huh?

384
00:21:10,027 --> 00:21:12,627
It's a reward for arresting the criminal.

385
00:21:12,627 --> 00:21:15,927
I made it with a straw wrapper a while ago!

386
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:17,327
This is...

387
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:19,927
cherry blossom.

388
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:21,327
A cherry blossom

389
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:24,327
is the mark that all people of the police have on them!

390
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:27,227
It's a symbol of strength, kindness, coolness,

391
00:21:27,227 --> 00:21:29,327
a flower of justice!

392
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:34,027
Who told you that?

393
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:35,927
Ms. Kobayashi!

394
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,327
She taught me how to make it the other day.

395
00:21:39,327 --> 00:21:40,827
Excuse me.

396
00:21:40,827 --> 00:21:43,127
Who's Ms. Kobayashi?

397
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:45,527
I heard that the children of my class are here,

398
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:48,427
so I've come for them.

399
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:14,327
It's Ms. Kobayashi!

400
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,927
Then, please take care of them.

401
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:19,327
Yes, sir. I'll take the cab and see them home.

402
00:23:19,327 --> 00:23:21,327
No.

403
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:23,827
If it's okay with you, let's take my car.

404
00:23:26,027 --> 00:23:27,227
Yes, sir.

405
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:30,427
Thank you.

406
00:23:30,427 --> 00:23:33,227
On top of the children having been a bother,

407
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:35,627
thank you so much for driving them home.

408
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:38,427
No problem at all.

409
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:42,727
An unexpected happy ending I'd say.

410
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:44,627
Yeah.

411
00:23:44,627 --> 00:23:47,827
Cherry blossoms bloom, as they say.

412
00:23:53,427 --> 00:23:56,627
"Next Episode."

413
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:58,827
Soshima?

414
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:00,627
Let's let the people of the jurisdiction

415
00:24:00,627 --> 00:24:01,927
take care of this case as an accident.

416
00:24:01,927 --> 00:24:03,127
Please wait!

417
00:24:03,127 --> 00:24:05,027
I still can't believe it!

418
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,827
Enough!

419
00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:09,727
Go cool your head outside!

420
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:13,127
The rate isn't a 100, but neither is it zero.

421
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:16,527
If he bet on the odds...

422
00:24:16,527 --> 00:24:18,127
Don't tell me that...

423
00:24:18,127 --> 00:24:19,427
Next Conan,

424
00:24:19,427 --> 00:24:22,627
"Crime with Zero Proven Evidence".
