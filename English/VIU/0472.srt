1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:02,455
Adventure!

2
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:04,455
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:05,755
The library room at school ten years ago,

4
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,255
it is filled with memories with Ran!

5
00:00:07,255 --> 00:00:08,855
A slightly dangerous code adventure!

6
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:10,155
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:11,755
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:13,855
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,061 --> 00:02:00,061
"Library"

10
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:20,861
"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Conan Doyle"

11
00:02:26,861 --> 00:02:29,761
Conan! Don't.

12
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:32,461
You're supposed to be quiet!

13
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:34,161
Sorry.

14
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:37,261
Besides, what bad manners yawning while you read.

15
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:39,561
I'm sure that the "Conan Doyle" that you love so much

16
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:42,761
is crying in his grave.

17
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:44,361
I can't help it, can I?

18
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:45,661
I've read all the mysteries that are here

19
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:49,161
when I was in elementary school already.

20
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:51,461
There's nothing more that I haven't read.

21
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:53,361
Really?

22
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:59,161
This world is much deeper and mysterious.

23
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:01,961
What was the voice I heard just now?

24
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,261
It feels like a distant memory.

25
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:06,061
Right, it was back then...

26
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,261
What with that scared look?

27
00:03:09,561 --> 00:03:10,861
No, nothing.

28
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:12,661
Hey!

29
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:14,661
Kojima, just what do you think you're doing?

30
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,061
Standing on books like that!

31
00:03:18,261 --> 00:03:20,961
But I can't reach the books on the higher shelf

32
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:22,661
if I don't do this...

33
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,661
Teacher, help!

34
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:28,861
Teacher!

35
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:31,561
See, I told you so.

36
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,961
Are you all right, Genta?

37
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:35,661
Which do you want to read?

38
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:37,561
I'll get it for you.

39
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:40,161
Ah, let's see...

40
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:43,561
Before that, let's put those books back.

41
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:45,961
Huh?

42
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:49,161
It seems like something is stuck inside.

43
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,261
I wonder what it is?

44
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:54,161
Maybe it's a dead lizard or a snake!

45
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:57,061
There are a lot of those things around nowadays, aren't there?

46
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:16,761
"The Adventures of Young Shinichi Kudo (Part 1)"

47
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:19,461
No.

48
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:21,361
Come on! Don't scare me like that.

49
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,161
I thought it was really a snake or something.

50
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:26,261
This is a wallet, isn't it?

51
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:30,061
Yes, but it looks like leather and not snake skin.

52
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,761
But, who could've put it here?

53
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:33,661
And for what reason?

54
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:37,861
Let's open it. Money could be inside!

55
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,061
Goodness...

56
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:46,761
There's only one piece of paper inside.

57
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:48,161
What?

58
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:51,761
There's something written on it.

59
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:53,361
What does it say?

60
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:54,761
"Thank you."

61
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,961
"Ran Mouri of 1st grade class A."

62
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:00,061
How do you know?

63
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:02,961
Does it really say so?

64
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:04,161
Let's look.

65
00:05:04,161 --> 00:05:05,161
"Thank you, Ran Mouri of 1st grade class A."

66
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:09,561
That's what's written...

67
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:13,761
Of course. Because that's what Ran and I...

68
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:19,361
I mean Ran told me that something like that happened in the past!

69
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,561
What kind of thing?

70
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:23,661
Yeah, that she encountered a very queer

71
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:26,061
and eerie incomprehensible situation!

72
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,761
"Ten years ago" -It was just about ten years ago.

73
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:31,561
Wait up, Shinichi!

74
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:33,461
Let's not do it after all.

75
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:35,061
I mean it's so late.

76
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:36,961
That's why I'm telling you to go home!

77
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,861
If they find out you snuck out, you're going to get scolded!

78
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:42,761
I'll figure out its identity alone.

79
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:45,261
I don't want you to go alone

80
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,061
and be eaten by the ghost.

81
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:51,561
Come off it!

82
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:54,661
There's no such thing as ghosts in the world!

83
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:57,261
But, Sonoko said she heard.

84
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:59,861
That it appears in the library on nights when the moon is full!

85
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:01,161
She says it groans in an eerie voice,

86
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,261
this ghost wearing a strange hat...

87
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:07,561
And tonight there happens to be full moon out there.

88
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:09,261
Very interesting.

89
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:13,461
Shinichi!

90
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:19,961
So, you're coming along after all.

91
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:21,461
Because...

92
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:27,461
No good after all, it's locked.

93
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:28,861
Can do!

94
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:35,361
Why is it not locked?

95
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:39,961
I left this window unlocked before leaving school today.

96
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:42,861
That security guard's not all that careful either.

97
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:47,361
Okay, let's go to the library then.

98
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:49,961
Oh, wait!

99
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:12,861
Ran!

100
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:19,261
Somebody's in the library!

101
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:20,461
Ghost?

102
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:31,161
It's just the security guard.

103
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:32,661
He scared me out of my wits.

104
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:37,061
He looks wasted today too.

105
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:39,261
Okay, since he checked this place now,

106
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:41,061
he won't be back here for some time.

107
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:10,961
See, there's no ghost anywhere.

108
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:13,461
But, there's a strange sound...

109
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:22,461
A ghost wearing a hat is looking in from the window!

110
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,861
Shinichi!

111
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:26,461
Come off it! Take a good look!

112
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:30,661
The hook of the curtain came off and it just looks that way.

113
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:32,761
It's said to appear on nights when the moon is full

114
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,361
because when it's brightly lit by the moon,

115
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:37,261
the silhouette of this is clearly outlined.

116
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:39,061
And the thing that sounds like a laugh

117
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:42,361
is the sound of the wind coming in from the space between the window.

118
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:45,761
This is how it goes for most ghost stories once the trick is revealed...

119
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:47,161
I guess so...

120
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:48,361
Come on, let's go home!

121
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,061
There's nothing here already.

122
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:53,261
Do you really think so?

123
00:08:57,761 --> 00:08:59,061
Shinichi!

124
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:04,061
Could it be that you just read the outline of the beginning of the story

125
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:07,361
and already think that you've figured everything out?

126
00:09:07,361 --> 00:09:08,361
"Arsene Lupin, Gentleman Burglar by Maurice LeBlanc"

127
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:10,961
This world is much deeper...

128
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:14,561
and mysterious.

129
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:16,161
What are you?

130
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:24,961
Me?

131
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:26,961
I'm your...

132
00:09:26,961 --> 00:09:29,061
Sibling.

133
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:30,161
What?

134
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:33,561
Rather, I should say, your younger brother,

135
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:36,261
although we're quite some years apart.

136
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:39,761
My younger brother?

137
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:41,161
Cut out the stupid joke.

138
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:43,361
Ran, get the security guard, quick!

139
00:09:43,361 --> 00:09:44,461
Okay!

140
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:50,461
What? It won't open!

141
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:51,661
What?

142
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:52,761
No use.

143
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:56,161
I've cast a spell on that door.

144
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:58,561
And it only listens to me.

145
00:09:58,561 --> 00:09:59,761
What'd you say?

146
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:03,661
Hold it, I didn't come here to have it out with you.

147
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:07,061
I came to challenge you.

148
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:08,461
That's all.

149
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:15,161
I'm wondering if you can find the treasure that is here.

150
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:16,861
Treasure?

151
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:19,261
If you find it, you win.

152
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:22,161
I'll give you the treasure.

153
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:23,361
On top of that,

154
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:26,461
I'll disclose my identity to you.

155
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:29,961
You're free to take on the challenge or not.

156
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:32,061
If you accept the challenge, I'll undo the spell

157
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:33,761
and you can get out of here.

158
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:34,961
But, if you don't accept it,

159
00:10:34,961 --> 00:10:37,261
you'll end up spending your entire life in this dark and cold room

160
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,261
that sends chills up your spine.

161
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:41,361
And by the way,

162
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:44,161
I happen to love blood.

163
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:46,861
I just can't resist red things.

164
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:49,861
You don't scare me at all!

165
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:53,761
We're not going to listen to a villain like you!

166
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:56,261
What a spirited young lady.

167
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:59,161
I accept.

168
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:01,361
I'm saying that I'm taking on the challenge!

169
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,161
I'm playing his game!

170
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,861
Just as would be expected of "Shinichi Kudo".

171
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:07,661
My "older brother".

172
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:21,461
Shinichi.

173
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:23,061
Why you... What do you think you're doing...

174
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:26,561
He's gone.

175
00:11:29,361 --> 00:11:30,861
He vanished?

176
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:52,971
Hey, Shinichi are you really going to take on the challenge?

177
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:53,971
Yeah.

178
00:11:53,971 --> 00:11:55,971
Because father tells me that I should never back out

179
00:11:55,971 --> 00:11:57,571
when somebody picks a fight with me.

180
00:11:57,571 --> 00:12:01,171
But, that man looked scary like the devil.

181
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:04,771
Be it a devil or an ogre,

182
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:07,971
I want to find out what his identity is.

183
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:09,471
"Let's repress the anger of Haido."

184
00:12:09,471 --> 00:12:11,871
As well as the answer to this code!

185
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:16,971
But if that man casts a strange spell on you again,

186
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:19,271
you might die, Shinichi.

187
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,471
Spell?

188
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:22,571
Remember, he cast a spell on the door

189
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:24,671
so that it wouldn't open, right?

190
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:27,171
Come off it! Take a good look.

191
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:29,671
There's a mop placed over there.

192
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:31,671
A fishing line is tied onto the handle

193
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:34,471
and passed through a hook that is suspended in air.

194
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:36,971
Since the time we entered this room

195
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:39,471
that guy manipulated the fishing line from behind the bookshelf

196
00:12:39,471 --> 00:12:43,571
and made the mop stop the door, so that it wouldn't open.

197
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:45,371
And as for the other door,

198
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:48,871
he probably locked it beforehand from the outside so it wouldn't open.

199
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:53,371
Either way, in this dark place it's hard to tell right off the bat.

200
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:56,671
Moreover, he said a lot of things to scare us

201
00:12:56,671 --> 00:12:58,871
but he's no wizard!

202
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:00,971
He's just a klutz of a magician

203
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:03,171
that forgot to hide the secret to his tricks!

204
00:13:03,171 --> 00:13:04,771
You're amazing, Shinichi!

205
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:06,971
You sound just like Holmes!

206
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:08,671
I guess so.

207
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:12,471
Then, Mr. Holmes?

208
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:15,271
What does that code say?

209
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:17,671
I don't know what it means but...

210
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,071
I think it is read as,

211
00:13:19,071 --> 00:13:23,271
"Haido no okoriwo chinmeyo" (Means let's repress the anger of Haido).

212
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:25,471
"Okoriwo chinmeyo"?

213
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,071
Is that really how you read it?

214
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:30,771
Yeah, the word "okoru" (kanji for anger) comes out a lot in novels.

215
00:13:30,771 --> 00:13:34,671
For the word, "chin", mom has a CD entitled "Chinkonka" (Kanji for Requiem)

216
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:35,671
"Requiem" -I asked her how it's read before,

217
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:37,071
so there's no mistake about it!

218
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:41,371
Maybe a grown-up can tell us what it means!

219
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:43,271
Let's ask our dads!

220
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:44,571
No way!

221
00:13:44,571 --> 00:13:46,871
Don't ever ask any grown-up!

222
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:49,471
This is a match between that guy and me!

223
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,471
That boy...

224
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,171
Read the phrase "Ikariwo shizumeyo" (Kanji for repress the anger),

225
00:14:03,171 --> 00:14:06,971
mistakenly and read, "Okoriwo chinmeyo"!

226
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,471
How cute.

227
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:11,871
I'll bet that boy called Shinichi was dumb!

228
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:15,171
Give me a break. You can't read it either, can you?

229
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:16,771
You don't have to laugh that hard.

230
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:18,071
Hey!

231
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:19,771
You can't help it.

232
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:22,171
I mean he was only a first grader back then after all.

233
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:26,671
But, that boy called Shinichi, kind of resembles Conan.

234
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:28,471
You think so?

235
00:14:28,471 --> 00:14:29,871
And then?

236
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:31,671
What happened after that?

237
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,371
Come on tell us, quick!

238
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:35,971
Did the two get home safely?

239
00:14:35,971 --> 00:14:39,771
Yeah, according to Ran...

240
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:41,771
Ran!

241
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:44,471
Where on earth did you go at this time of night?

242
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:47,971
Well, I sort of forgot something at school so...

243
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,271
Don't lie to me!

244
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:51,771
It's Shinichi again, isn't it?

245
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:53,671
Yes.

246
00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:54,871
Just as I thought!

247
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:57,571
I thought he was putting on a low profile recently but...

248
00:14:57,571 --> 00:15:00,471
I wonder how Yukiko is bringing him up?

249
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:05,271
A liberal upbringing as would be expected of her, I'd say.

250
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,071
Honey, are you going to work?

251
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:11,671
Yeah. There was a murder at a warehouse at Haido Harbor just a while ago.

252
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:14,271
I got a call from Inspector Megure.

253
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:16,371
Please do be careful!

254
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:18,071
I mean it's so dangerous these days.

255
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:20,971
Make sure you lock the doors too!

256
00:15:20,971 --> 00:15:24,971
It seems that the flashy thief is out there having a ball too, so...

257
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:25,971
Of course!

258
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:27,971
I mean I'm the wife of a police officer after all!

259
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:29,471
Bye.

260
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,671
Bye. Take care of Ran, Eri.

261
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:34,671
Okay...

262
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:36,071
I got it!

263
00:15:36,071 --> 00:15:37,871
I'll give him a good lecture.

264
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,771
I'm so sorry, Eri.

265
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:41,071
Good night.

266
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:47,371
So, you're not going to bed until you spit it out, Shinichi.

267
00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:51,471
Why did you take a girl with you to school at night?

268
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:54,371
I told you already, didn't I?

269
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,171
I forgot something and went to get it.

270
00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:59,571
Do you think that suffices as an answer?

271
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:01,471
Well, no big deal!

272
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:04,071
They both came back safely.

273
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:06,471
But, Yusaku...

274
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:09,171
Besides, this is not an interrogation by the police,

275
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:12,471
so getting angry will only make him more reticent.

276
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,271
First, repress your anger and deal with him calmly.

277
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:18,071
"Let's repress your anger"?

278
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:20,471
How do you write that word?

279
00:16:20,471 --> 00:16:21,971
"Let's repress the anger".

280
00:16:21,971 --> 00:16:23,271
Do you write it like this?

281
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:25,771
What's that?

282
00:16:26,971 --> 00:16:28,071
Well, the teacher...

283
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,371
It's a secret code that the teacher made.

284
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:32,171
What a teacher.

285
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:34,571
Giving a code with difficult kanji characters like this to first graders.

286
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:35,771
"Let's repress the anger of Haido."

287
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:39,471
But, she seems to be an interesting teacher who likes riddles.

288
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:41,371
Riddles?

289
00:16:41,371 --> 00:16:45,471
It's to simple to deem that "Haido" is someone's name.

290
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,471
Right!

291
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:48,371
Shall we go to the beach or something soon?

292
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:49,871
How nice!

293
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:53,771
Haido Harbor?

294
00:16:53,771 --> 00:16:57,871
Does that code say "Go to Haido Harbor", Shinichi?

295
00:16:57,871 --> 00:16:59,071
Yeah.

296
00:16:59,071 --> 00:17:02,071
"Let's repress the anger of Haido".

297
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:04,971
It means the place where the anchors of ships are sunk in Haido-cho,

298
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:06,771
in other words the harbor.

299
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:11,571
But, Shinichi, I thought last night you read it as "okoriwo chinmeyo"?

300
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:14,671
Did I?

301
00:17:14,671 --> 00:17:16,571
But are you sure it's okay?

302
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:20,271
After all, that man snuck into school at night

303
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:22,771
and was waiting for you, wasn't he?

304
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:24,571
Don't you think we should notify the police?

305
00:17:24,571 --> 00:17:25,771
He said that if I decipher this code,

306
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:28,671
he would disclose his identity.

307
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:30,771
We can contact the police then.

308
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:32,571
But I'm really sorry, Doc,

309
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:35,471
for making you come along with us so early in the morning.

310
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,071
No... Rather, I'm glad you did.

311
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:41,571
It's been a long time since I've seen you both getting along so well.

312
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:48,071
You two used to always play together up to elementary school,

313
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:49,771
but since you guys haven't been around much together recently,

314
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,571
I got worried

315
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,971
thinking that maybe you fought or something.

316
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:55,971
No, we didn't.

317
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:57,171
Right?

318
00:17:57,171 --> 00:17:59,071
Yeah.

319
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:04,071
Look at all the police cars.

320
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:06,971
I wonder if something happened?

321
00:18:06,971 --> 00:18:09,571
Come to think of it, dad was saying last night

322
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:11,971
that there was a murder at Haido Harbor.

323
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:14,571
Don't tell me that the man is the killer?

324
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:16,471
No, it can't be.

325
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:22,271
The incident occurred about the same time you both snuck into school.

326
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:26,571
And there was a news report saying that the killer was arrested at dawn.

327
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:29,171
The question is why does the man that you saw last night

328
00:18:29,171 --> 00:18:32,971
want you both to come here?

329
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:36,371
-If we wait here, maybe he'll come? -No.

330
00:18:36,371 --> 00:18:39,071
I just can't resist red things.

331
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:40,871
Red, it's red.

332
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,271
Something that's red.

333
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:43,671
What about that?

334
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:46,171
The place where the light is on is red!

335
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:48,271
Dr. Agasa already told us, didn't he?

336
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:51,571
The case has nothing to do with him.

337
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:55,071
He wouldn't have known that police cars would be here.

338
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:57,671
Which means he was referring to something red

339
00:18:57,671 --> 00:18:58,871
that was here to begin with.

340
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:05,871
"Fire hydrant" -The fire hydrant?

341
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:10,671
But nobody seems to be here.

342
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:14,971
It's flipped over!

343
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:21,571
A code is behind it.

344
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:23,271
Another difficult Kanji character.

345
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:24,471
Let's see...

346
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:27,971
"Prove that Toriya is innocent."

347
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:30,371
"Surprise wise old man out of his wits."

348
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:36,771
I can tell that "Toriya" means Toriya-cho,

349
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:40,771
but prove the Toriya innocent is what I can't make out.

350
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:43,771
I'm sure it's some kind of riddle, though.

351
00:19:43,771 --> 00:19:47,371
Does wise old man mean Komon Mito?

352
00:19:47,371 --> 00:19:48,571
Maybe.

353
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:50,271
Doc, if it says the guy's innocent,

354
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:52,471
it means that he's not the culprit, right?

355
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:53,971
Yeah.

356
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:55,671
If he's the culprit, he's black.

357
00:19:56,771 --> 00:19:58,471
My dad, often says,

358
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:00,971
"That guy's black, he's the culprit".

359
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:02,471
Black?

360
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:04,971
He's not the culprit. He's not black.

361
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,771
In other words, he's white.

362
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:09,871
White...

363
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:11,771
The Toriya Castle (Has the same sound as white)!

364
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:14,771
Let's head off immediately to the remains of the Toriya Castle then!

365
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:18,171
No, We're going to the floodgate near that castle!

366
00:20:18,171 --> 00:20:19,171
The floodgate?

367
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:21,071
Not the castle?

368
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:22,471
The wise old man,

369
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,271
just as Ran said is Komon Mito.

370
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:26,471
"Liver" mean internal organ (Has the same sound as wits).

371
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:28,671
"Surprise wise old man out of his wits" most probably means

372
00:20:28,671 --> 00:20:30,371
to take the center out.

373
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:31,571
"Komon Mito" -So, by removing the two kanji words in the middle,

374
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:33,671
"to" and "kou", from Komon Mito.

375
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:35,571
"Suimon" (Means floodgate in kanji)

376
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:36,571
I see!

377
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:39,971
The kanji characters that remain are "Mizu" (water) and "Mon" (gate).

378
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:41,971
Since it's near Toriya Castle,

379
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:43,471
it has to be the Toriya Floodgates!

380
00:20:47,571 --> 00:20:51,071
So, here we are at Toriya Floodgate.

381
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,871
There's nothing red and suspicious here.

382
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:06,071
Maybe we should've gone to the remains of the castle first, after all?

383
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:10,271
If so, the phrase, "Prove that Toriya is innocent" would've sufficed.

384
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,571
But, the flood gate was written after that.

385
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:14,771
Which means that here

386
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:17,371
or in between the floodgate and the castle somewhere,

387
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:18,671
there's a red thing...

388
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:22,471
The railroad crossing!

389
00:21:34,671 --> 00:21:35,971
Did you find anything?

390
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:38,371
No, nothing really.

391
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:39,571
Wait a second.

392
00:21:39,571 --> 00:21:42,571
If we find it before this alarm turns red,

393
00:21:42,571 --> 00:21:43,971
there would be no meaning.

394
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:46,871
The place we can find something after it gets red is...

395
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:48,171
the crossing bar.

396
00:21:57,171 --> 00:21:58,271
Shinichi?

397
00:21:58,271 --> 00:21:59,371
Did you find it?

398
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:02,371
"Erase the mark of Okuho."

399
00:22:02,371 --> 00:22:04,371
"Clench your teeth in solitaire with an unclear voice"

400
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:06,471
-"Erase..." -"Erase..."

401
00:22:06,471 --> 00:22:09,571
"The mark of Okuho."

402
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:13,071
"Clench your teeth in solitaire with an unclear voice."

403
00:22:23,971 --> 00:22:26,671
The third code?

404
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:59,571
"Next Episode" -It's full of kanji characters.

405
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,071
"East" -This looks familiar?

406
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:04,371
A code?

407
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:09,971
I see! Today's a public holiday!

408
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:13,071
Maybe this is "weathervane".

409
00:24:13,071 --> 00:24:14,671
Weathervane?

410
00:24:14,671 --> 00:24:18,371
I see! It's direction!

411
00:24:18,371 --> 00:24:20,771
I see. That's what it is.

412
00:24:21,271 --> 00:24:22,571
Next Conan,

413
00:24:22,571 --> 00:24:26,771
"The Adventures of Young Shinichi Kudo (Part 2)"

414
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:44,571
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:47,371
"The person who gave Thief Kid his name"

416
00:24:47,371 --> 00:24:50,471
Toriya floodgate, a flood gate case indeed.
