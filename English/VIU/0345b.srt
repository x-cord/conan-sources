1
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,938
Thank you.

2
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,138
But, they sure got a lot of them gathered here.

3
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:27,338
You can say that again.

4
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:28,439
What?

5
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,838
It's finally going to start.

6
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:36,939
Yeah.

7
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,738
You devilish diabolic monsters

8
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,838
who wander through the nether world,

9
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:49,638
welcome to our haunted ship named Phantom.

10
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:55,338
I am Captain Gold and I will be navigating this phantom ship.

11
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:58,138
There's only an hour more to go before the party.

12
00:00:58,139 --> 00:01:02,238
Please pick your comrades who will be sharing fate with you.

13
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,538
Seven comrades who have received the same seal as yourself.

14
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:09,038
The same seal?

15
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,538
The tarot card!

16
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:13,238
You got one when you came on board too, didn't you?

17
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,538
I think we're going to team up with people who got the same card

18
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:19,039
and play a game or something.

19
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:23,938
You mean this XV that's written here,

20
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,238
the card of the goat.

21
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,438
Which means we're on the goat team?

22
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,238
That's not a goat.

23
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:34,738
In Roman Numerals XV is the figure 15.

24
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:37,338
The name of the card is The Devil.

25
00:01:37,339 --> 00:01:39,138
The card of the devil.

26
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:41,038
Oh, is that right?

27
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:43,238
Besides, we weren't divided in groups

28
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:46,238
just to play a game.

29
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,138
This party is also an audition for a role in a movie too.

30
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:51,738
An audition?

31
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:53,138
You know, don't you?

32
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:54,538
The movie that's played every summer called.

33
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:57,838
"The Diary of Captain Ghost's Voyage".

34
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:59,238
Yeah.

35
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:01,638
The one about a load of monsters riding a phantom ship

36
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:05,338
and coming to get people who performed evil deeds.

37
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:06,538
Which means if things work out,

38
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:08,738
I may appear in the movie too?

39
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:10,038
Yes.

40
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,538
This seems to be the fourth time this party's been held,

41
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:14,738
and each year the movie staff

42
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:16,838
seem to be mixed among everyone here

43
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:19,139
to judge carefully for the cast.

44
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:22,538
I see.

45
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:25,438
Everyone wants to play the part of popular monster roles,

46
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,738
so they divide people into teams to make choosing easier.

47
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,038
That's why everyone's

48
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,838
trying to put out their best, right?

49
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:36,238
The Werewolf who roars towards the moon.

50
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,338
The Frankenstein that moves like a robot

51
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:40,638
and does pantomime.

52
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,438
The Mummy who keeps his silence no matter who talks to him.

53
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,738
Well, although they're going to appear in the movie,

54
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:49,838
they're no more than supporting actors

55
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:51,738
who will appear behind the main stars.

56
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,138
Since it'll cost an enormous amount of money

57
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:56,438
if the film company has to cover makeup fees

58
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,838
and everything for all the supporting actors,

59
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:00,838
so they let horror fans appear in their best outfits

60
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:03,738
and put on their best act.

61
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:08,638
Besides, holding an event on the this ship that was used in the movie

62
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,839
will serve as an advertisement for the movie too.

63
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,338
All right, all of you!

64
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:23,438
The time to set sail has come!

65
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,538
We shall cross the seven cursed seas

66
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,238
and show the conceited humans our power

67
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,739
as well as teach them a lesson!

68
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,038
Don't tell me this ship is...

69
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,339
really going to move?

70
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:49,738
Is there anyone who has the card of Death?

71
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,138
Hermit!

72
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:53,939
Anybody around who has the card of the Hermit?

73
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,238
What? Shinichi Kudo?

74
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,938
You mean that high school detective is on this ship?

75
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:07,438
Right...

76
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,438
But I heard that he was involved in some kind of incident

77
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,238
and was killed.

78
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,538
No way! That's nothing but lies!

79
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:18,338
And? What kind of disguise was he in?

80
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,838
He was bandaged up,

81
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,138
so maybe a mummy?

82
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:22,238
A mummy detective.

83
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:24,239
That would be so handsome!

84
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,638
Okay!

85
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,438
All seven of us are here!

86
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,238
They're the people we saw just a while ago.

87
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:38,538
Now our names...

88
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:40,138
This is Medusa.

89
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,138
Werewolf, Frankenstein and Mummy.

90
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:49,639
And can we call you Mummy 2?

91
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,439
What? Do you want to shake hands?

92
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,138
I see.

93
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,538
You're Invisible Man.

94
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,038
So...

95
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:12,238
I wonder what the seven of us are going to do?

96
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:15,439
They did say that this was a catch the culprit sort of game.

97
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,338
How do you like the game I made this time?

98
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,738
It's pretty cool, don't you think?

99
00:05:27,739 --> 00:05:29,938
Yeah. It's a masterpiece!

100
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:31,638
Right!

101
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,538
-I'm sure this'll satisfy them. -Yes, Agasa residence.

102
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:35,938
-I'll call them first thing tomorrow. -I'm sorry for calling this late.

103
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:37,238
This is Dr. Araide.

104
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,838
-Is Dr. Agasa there? -I'll have them monitor it!

105
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,338
He's not in.

106
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,338
I think he went out somewhere with Edogawa.

107
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:46,538
What? But I hear their voices.

108
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:48,138
This?

109
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,538
It's their recorded voices.

110
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:51,739
I don't know what prank they're up to.

111
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,138
But it's been playing for some time now.

112
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,138
So, what's up?

113
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,938
Oh, yeah.

114
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,738
Actually, I wanted to talk to you.

115
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:08,038
Well, your cold's taking a while to get better, right?

116
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,738
So I figured you should be checked at a hospital with good facilities,

117
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,238
and asked a friend doctor of mine,

118
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,938
but was told that he has to go on a business trip,

119
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:19,538
so he's only available tonight.

120
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:20,938
That is why...

121
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:22,838
I know this is really sudden

122
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,238
but can I go pick you up now?

123
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:29,538
I'll notify Dr. Agasa later for you.

124
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:32,439
Well, I don't want to force you though.

125
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,138
It doesn't bother me.

126
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:38,238
I was kind of angry anyway because they're doing their own thing.

127
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:41,039
Besides, it's boring staying home alone.

128
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,738
Great.

129
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:45,838
Then, okay.

130
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,238
I'll be there in about an hour

131
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:51,538
so will you get ready to leave as soon as I get there?

132
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:52,638
Okay.

133
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,239
I'll see you in an hour then.

134
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:14,996
All right! All seven of us have finally gathered!

135
00:07:14,997 --> 00:07:17,596
What dense guys.

136
00:07:17,597 --> 00:07:19,396
Pops?

137
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:25,296
Werewolf, Frankenstein and Mummy are nowhere in sight.

138
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:26,496
What?

139
00:07:26,497 --> 00:07:27,996
I wonder if they went to the toilet.

140
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:29,796
I guess so?

141
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:33,196
If that is the case, let's go see.

142
00:07:33,197 --> 00:07:36,496
The party is about to begin too.

143
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,597
Yeah.

144
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:43,196
It's over here.

145
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:44,896
Oh, there he is!

146
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,096
I tell you, Frankenstein!

147
00:07:47,097 --> 00:07:50,596
We looked all over for you!

148
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:54,096
What a toilet this is, though.

149
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:56,296
It's dimly lit and full of spider webs,

150
00:07:56,297 --> 00:07:58,196
even the mirror is cracked.

151
00:07:58,197 --> 00:08:00,796
Not only that, men and women have to use the toilet together!

152
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:03,396
After all, we're all monsters,

153
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:06,796
so I guess there's no need to differentiate between men and women.

154
00:08:06,797 --> 00:08:08,796
It won't come off.

155
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:12,396
The blood on my hands won't come off.

156
00:08:12,397 --> 00:08:16,096
It won't come off even if I wash my hands.

157
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:19,996
Hey, acting your part even in the toilet too?

158
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:21,496
Excuse me.

159
00:08:21,497 --> 00:08:25,597
Are Werewolf and Mummy here?

160
00:08:28,697 --> 00:08:30,196
They don't seem to be here.

161
00:08:30,197 --> 00:08:31,297
Yeah.

162
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:46,797
What was that?

163
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:03,196
Hey, boss! What's up?

164
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:04,396
Bartender.

165
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:07,196
Can you give me the same thing he's drinking?

166
00:09:07,197 --> 00:09:09,496
Silver Bullet?

167
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:12,396
White Lady for me then, please.

168
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:13,996
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:16,796
Hey, you don't look too hot.

170
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:19,297
Are you bummed out or something?

171
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:21,497
Hey.

172
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:27,596
What is it?

173
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:29,797
Is he looking for somebody?

174
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:36,996
I wonder where Mummy disappeared to?

175
00:09:36,997 --> 00:09:39,696
How should I know? Geez...

176
00:09:39,697 --> 00:09:42,996
Of all things! Talk about not being able to work in groups.

177
00:09:42,997 --> 00:09:45,597
An hour has already gone by.

178
00:09:46,997 --> 00:09:48,197
-What? -What's...

179
00:09:49,497 --> 00:09:51,297
The party has started.

180
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:57,896
Listen, you monsters.

181
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:01,296
I've got good news for all of you.

182
00:10:01,297 --> 00:10:04,196
The bait's been set.

183
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:06,896
It seems that there is a human

184
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,296
among us at this party

185
00:10:09,297 --> 00:10:12,696
that is neither ugly nor possesses evil power.

186
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:15,196
Go now and join hands with the seven comrades

187
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,596
that you will share your fate with.

188
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:20,796
Find the good-for-nothing, tear its meat apart,

189
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:22,596
pull out its guts

190
00:10:22,597 --> 00:10:25,696
and drink up to the last drop the blood

191
00:10:25,697 --> 00:10:28,097
that comes flowing out!

192
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,296
Okay!

193
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,296
If it's looking for the culprit, there's none other than I,

194
00:10:33,297 --> 00:10:35,596
Kogoro Mouri, more suited for the job!

195
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:38,896
But, not all seven of us are here yet.

196
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:40,496
Who cares!

197
00:10:40,497 --> 00:10:42,496
If I figure out who the culprit is,

198
00:10:42,497 --> 00:10:45,096
I'm sure they'll come walking out from their side!

199
00:10:45,097 --> 00:10:50,496
I have the keyword which is the hint to who it is.

200
00:10:50,497 --> 00:10:52,696
If you want to get hold of the treasure

201
00:10:52,697 --> 00:10:54,296
that is to be your reward,

202
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:56,397
come out to deck and receive my revelation...

203
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,697
What's that?

204
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:17,896
What's the matter?

205
00:11:17,897 --> 00:11:22,696
I'm sorry, the load that was on the construction truck fell off.

206
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:24,696
We'll clear it up right away,

207
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:26,896
so please give us a moment.

208
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:28,596
I'm in a bit of a rush,

209
00:11:28,597 --> 00:11:29,896
so I'm going to go around.

210
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,397
I'm sorry.

211
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:41,297
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:49,296
Thank you for waiting.

213
00:11:49,297 --> 00:11:50,996
You may go through now.

214
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:53,097
Thank you. Goodbye.

215
00:11:56,597 --> 00:11:58,397
Take care!

216
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:06,397
He just went through.

217
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:10,596
What's that?

218
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,097
That's...

219
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:17,497
Captain of the phantom ship?

220
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:21,997
What a grand performance.

221
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:30,396
This is real blood.

222
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:31,397
What?

223
00:12:31,398 --> 00:12:32,496
Hurry!

224
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:34,597
Hurry, somebody get him down!

225
00:12:54,997 --> 00:12:56,397
Yes...

226
00:13:29,217 --> 00:13:31,017
Hi.

227
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:08,117
Hi.

228
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:40,177
Oh, I'm sorry to have surprised you.

229
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:42,977
I'm an English teacher of Teitan High School,

230
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:45,877
where Dr. Araide is in charge of.

231
00:13:45,878 --> 00:13:50,177
His car broke down on his way here.

232
00:13:50,178 --> 00:13:54,078
That's why I've come to pick you up instead!

233
00:13:55,278 --> 00:14:00,278
If it's okay with you, will you please unchain the door?

234
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:10,578
I'm really late.

235
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:20,778
Jodie.

236
00:14:42,978 --> 00:14:46,677
His chest is pierced through with an arrow of a bow gun.

237
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:47,877
Moreover,

238
00:14:47,878 --> 00:14:50,977
the card of the devil is here too.

239
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:56,177
So, the devil's the guide to the world beyond?

240
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:57,977
I don't think he needed any guide to take him

241
00:14:57,978 --> 00:15:00,977
to the world beyond though,

242
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:03,277
because he seemed to have died on the spot.

243
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:04,777
True.

244
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,277
And as for the bow gun that fired the arrow,

245
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,877
it's probably been disposed of somewhere in this vast Pacific Ocean

246
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:13,477
so virtually will not be found.

247
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:17,377
So, I wonder if there's a camera on this ship?

248
00:15:17,378 --> 00:15:20,577
I'd like to take a picture of the scene.

249
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:22,077
We have a digital camera

250
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,177
that we are using to take pictures of this party.

251
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:26,677
Well, it's something that will serve as evidence

252
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:28,677
so I'd prefer something on film, but...

253
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:29,777
Pops,

254
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:32,877
I've got a disposable camera on me.

255
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:34,577
See.

256
00:15:34,578 --> 00:15:37,078
Well, I guess it's better than nothing.

257
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:48,478
I'll take a look at his face then.

258
00:15:50,978 --> 00:15:53,977
I think I've seen him somewhere before.

259
00:15:53,978 --> 00:15:58,577
Isn't he a movie producer that appears a lot on TV?

260
00:15:58,578 --> 00:16:02,377
I think his name was Senzo Fukuura.

261
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,777
I think he became famous

262
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:08,077
after producing the Unlucky Days series,

263
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:10,277
before the Phantom Ship Captain series.

264
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:14,377
Are you saying that the producer appeared in the movie in person

265
00:16:14,378 --> 00:16:15,977
and acted the role of the captain of Phantom Ship?

266
00:16:15,978 --> 00:16:20,677
No, the movie was filmed using a real actor.

267
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:24,077
Mr. Fukuura loved the captain of the Phantom Ship,

268
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:26,577
so he used to play the role of his own initiative every year

269
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:28,377
at the party on board.

270
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:31,277
Mr. Fukuura is the one who planned the performance of

271
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:33,877
appearing on the mast with the light shining on him

272
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:35,077
and giving out hints to the quiz.

273
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,377
Yeah.

274
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:41,477
You mean that quiz about humans being mixed up here among the monsters.

275
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:45,278
There's a microphone attached to the inside of the mask.

276
00:16:47,878 --> 00:16:51,778
It seems he was talking directly into this microphone.

277
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,477
And?

278
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:56,877
What's the answer to this quiz?

279
00:16:56,878 --> 00:16:59,477
Well, the quizzes and hints

280
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,277
were decide on by Mr. Fukuura alone,

281
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:04,477
so we, the staff know nothing about them.

282
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:07,777
We heard that the first group to solve the quiz

283
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:12,477
would receive an invitation to the preview of the movie, though.

284
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:14,077
Well,

285
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,078
it seems quite definite that one of you among the staff is the killer.

286
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:21,977
First of all,

287
00:17:21,978 --> 00:17:24,677
Mr. Fukuura who was disguised as the captain of the phantom ship

288
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:27,977
started suffering while he was announcing the quiz.

289
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:32,477
He was probably struck by the bow gun then.

290
00:17:32,478 --> 00:17:34,177
However, back then,

291
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,877
we, the passengers,

292
00:17:35,878 --> 00:17:39,177
were still inside the ship at the party hall.

293
00:17:39,178 --> 00:17:41,277
It would've been impossible for us

294
00:17:41,278 --> 00:17:42,877
to fire the bow gun at Mr. Fukuura

295
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:44,477
who was on the top of the mast.

296
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:46,277
So high chances the person who killed him

297
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:48,177
is the one who prepared the lighting

298
00:17:48,178 --> 00:17:51,777
and audio devices when he announce the quiz,

299
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:54,277
which is one of the staff.

300
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:57,777
Secondly, this card of the devil.

301
00:17:57,778 --> 00:17:59,777
The killer probably wanted to mislead people into thinking

302
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,477
that one of the passengers who boarded this ship

303
00:18:02,478 --> 00:18:04,777
that received this card is the killer.

304
00:18:04,778 --> 00:18:07,577
Since you're the ones who prepared the cards,

305
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:09,877
you probably could make as many of these cards as you wanted to.

306
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:10,977
No.

307
00:18:10,978 --> 00:18:15,377
These cards were made by Mr. Fukuura to avoid foul play.

308
00:18:15,378 --> 00:18:17,477
So, it would have been impossible for any of the staff

309
00:18:17,478 --> 00:18:18,877
to prepare these cards.

310
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:21,377
Last year he used playing cards.

311
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:25,177
Besides there was a passenger who was on deck

312
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:27,177
before the quiz was announced too.

313
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:29,378
Saying that he wanted to look at the ocean.

314
00:18:30,578 --> 00:18:32,577
I don't remember who exactly that person was

315
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,777
since it was dark though.

316
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:36,977
Oh, is that right?

317
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:39,177
I see.

318
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:42,677
Which means the possibility of the killer being among us

319
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:46,878
who has received the card of the devil is high!

320
00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:02,977
Are you okay?

321
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:07,677
The doctor that we're going to see is very efficient!

322
00:19:07,678 --> 00:19:10,477
So, your cold will be cured right away

323
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:12,878
and you'll feel better in no time at all.

324
00:19:30,678 --> 00:19:31,877
By the way,

325
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:34,977
when is this ship returning to the harbor?

326
00:19:34,978 --> 00:19:37,877
I think it'll be another hour or so.

327
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:39,077
I see.

328
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,377
Then, shall we go inside the ship

329
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:43,577
and investigate the case?

330
00:19:43,578 --> 00:19:45,577
Mr. Sleeping Vampire?

331
00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:47,078
Oh, okay.

332
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,377
What's up, Pops?

333
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:58,677
It seems we're going to be late

334
00:19:58,678 --> 00:20:00,478
so I thought I'd let Ran know.

335
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:20,977
She's not answering.

336
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:23,277
Maybe she's taking a bath?

337
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:27,078
"Mouri Detective Agency."

338
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,989
Okay, then.

339
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,590
Please show me the card of the devil that you all have.

340
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,389
What?

341
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,589
What's the matter, Mummy?

342
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,190
I wonder if I dropped it somewhere?

343
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,889
You deliberately poked your card with the arrow

344
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,889
and tried to free yourself from being a suspect, right?

345
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,789
You played on the psychology that

346
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,789
nobody would think that the killer himself

347
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,489
would leave his devil card behind with the victim,

348
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,889
unaware that this card

349
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,689
was a one of a kind in this world,

350
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,889
that Mr. Fukuura had exclusively made!

351
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,189
I was fully aware of that too!

352
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,589
How'd you know?

353
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,989
Because...

354
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,089
I was asked by Mr. Fukuura

355
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,089
to sit among the passengers

356
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,489
and choose someone with great makeup on.

357
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,489
After all, I'm also a staff member of the movie!

358
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,490
What?

359
00:21:56,491 --> 00:21:59,090
You're a movie staff member?

360
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,389
So I would never dream of hurting Mr. Fukuura.

361
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,689
Are you the only movie staff

362
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,289
that is mixed up among the passengers here?

363
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,689
No.

364
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,389
Almost all the other mummies besides me are staff members.

365
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,489
When we find passengers with great makeup,

366
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,489
we contacted Mr. Fukuura by e-mail.

367
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,589
Mr. Fukuura was also the one that gave us this outfit, right?

368
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,889
Yeah.

369
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,089
We received all kinds of instructions from Mr. Fukuura

370
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,589
while he was helping us with the makeup.

371
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,589
Instructions? What kind of instructions?

372
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,489
Like, drink a certain kind of wine, et cetera.

373
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,089
I was told to eat only chicken dishes.

374
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,989
I was told to wear this red wig.

375
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,989
All his instructions were varied depending on the person

376
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,089
and the only common instruction he gave us was not to talk.

377
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,889
What kind of instruction is that supposed to be?

378
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,389
How should I know?

379
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,790
It's Mr. Fukuura's instructions!

380
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,189
But...

381
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,889
when we were waiting for the quiz,

382
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,789
you disappeared from before us, didn't you?

383
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,789
I went to the toilet!

384
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,089
These two were with me too!

385
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,389
Right?

386
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,889
It's true.

387
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,889
That you were with us when we went to the toilet.

388
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,389
See!

389
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,889
But...

390
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,389
I didn't see you come out of the toilet.

391
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:34,089
What? What are you talking about?

392
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,889
I passed right behind you when I left!

393
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,789
Why're you saying something like that?

394
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,889
I guess you didn't notice me

395
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,889
because somebody cracked the mirror.

396
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,889
What? You mean that mirror

397
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:51,289
wasn't cracked to begin with in order to give a creepy atmosphere?

398
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,889
Yes.

399
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:57,189
It wasn't cracked until we departed!

400
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,089
Are you sure?

401
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,189
Yes!

402
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,589
We, the staff, decorated this ship together.

403
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,789
But we weren't given instructions

404
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,989
to crack the mirror in the toilet.

405
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,489
Then, just before Mr. Fukuura was about to give out the quiz,

406
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,789
where were you?

407
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,489
I was here!

408
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,389
Near Werewolf! Right?

409
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,589
You saw me, didn't you?

410
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,489
I wonder. I don't remember.

411
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,189
Oh, no.

412
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,389
I was desperate trying to sell myself

413
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,889
because I wanted a part in the movie!

414
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,290
Like this!

415
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,089
Come to think of it,

416
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,190
you were roaring several times.

417
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:51,889
It seems that nobody's seen you around.

418
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:55,789
Which means you don't have an established alibi.

419
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,089
Oh, no.

420
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,489
It... It's a trap!

421
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:03,589
Somebody's conspired to frame me!

422
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:08,189
A killer who's cornered barks a lot.

423
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:13,389
Moreover, you don't have an alibi and the devil card.

424
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,489
Mummy, you're the only one...

425
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:20,189
You're the only one that could've committed the murder!

426
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,689
Detective Mouri, you're a little off there.

427
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,389
What?

428
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,089
The truth is still in the dark.

429
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,389
The voice is coming from the speaker the phantom ship captain was using!

430
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,689
Darn it!

431
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,989
The deck!

432
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,690
Out of my way!

433
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,089
Who is it?

434
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,790
Where are you?

435
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,789
You've already acquired everything you need

436
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,589
to solve the case and yet...

437
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,889
How disappointing.

438
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,989
Why you!

439
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,089
Who are you?

440
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,390
You better shut up or you're going to pay for this!

441
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,089
Have you forgotten me already?

442
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,290
It's me, Detective Mouri.

443
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,990
Invisible man!

444
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,789
Captain of this phantom ship, Captain Gold, that is,

445
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,889
the host of this party

446
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,089
and movie producer, Mr. Senzo Fukuura,

447
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,789
was killed by who?

448
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,689
And...

449
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,290
how was he killed?

450
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:44,990
Shall we...

451
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,590
begin solving the case then?

452
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,589
That voice.

453
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,689
That tone of voice.

454
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,589
It can't be...

455
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,590
Under the moonlight...

456
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,590
that shines light upon the dark night.
