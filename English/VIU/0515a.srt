1
00:00:06,477 --> 00:00:09,977
He's not feeling well? You mean Uncle Jirokichi?

2
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:12,777
I thought that he'd be the one to stick around

3
00:00:12,776 --> 00:00:15,176
even if all mankind perished,

4
00:00:15,176 --> 00:00:18,976
but it seems that he's recently lost his appetite too.

5
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:25,876
Does he have some kind of serious illness?

6
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:29,676
I guess you could call it an illness of the heart.

7
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:31,576
-Heart? -Yes.

8
00:00:31,576 --> 00:00:32,976
He says he has nightmares every night

9
00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:35,676
and wakes up sweating.

10
00:00:35,676 --> 00:00:38,376
He says he sees "you know who" smiling at him in his sleep.

11
00:00:38,376 --> 00:00:39,676
"You know who"?

12
00:00:39,676 --> 00:00:42,676
You know. Him! Who else?

13
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:46,376
What? Who?

14
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:47,976
I'll bet you it's none other than

15
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:50,576
that elusive, audacious, dauntless thief.

16
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:53,676
That villain that puts on airs, right?

17
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:23,276
The start of the age of mystery.

18
00:01:23,276 --> 00:01:25,676
The detective show on Monday at 7.

19
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:27,276
Kid is after the Big Jewel

20
00:01:27,276 --> 00:01:29,376
with teleportation that seems impossible.

21
00:01:29,376 --> 00:01:30,976
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:32,776
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:35,276
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

24
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:16,673
"Thief Kid's Teleportation Magic"

25
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:23,273
Darn!

26
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:25,673
"Jirokichi Suzuki (72)" -No good, no good at all!

27
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:28,473
A plan like this is totally useless!

28
00:03:28,473 --> 00:03:31,373
We're up against the notorious "Magician Under the Moonlight",

29
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:32,973
the great Thief Kid.

30
00:03:32,973 --> 00:03:37,673
What makes you think that such half way measures...

31
00:03:37,673 --> 00:03:40,773
will help to capture him?

32
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:46,173
Sir, I think you should rest a while.

33
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:47,973
I don't think you should push yourself too far.

34
00:03:47,973 --> 00:03:49,373
It's not good for your body.

35
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:52,773
Then, will you think up some fantastic plan

36
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:56,473
to capture him while I'm sleeping?

37
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:58,373
Oh, well, no.

38
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:01,573
Are you going to bestow me with some incredible method

39
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:05,273
of keeping Thief Kid from stealing the "bait"...

40
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:17,173
which I got hold of, the legendary pair of mules "purple nail"?

41
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:21,473
That's the illusionary gem that even Maria Teresia,

42
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:23,873
the sovereign leader of the Roman Empire

43
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:25,473
was said to have been dazzled by.

44
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,473
The dazzling gem on your fingertips

45
00:04:27,473 --> 00:04:31,173
is the 100 karat amethyst!

46
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:33,773
Who cares about its value?

47
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,273
As long as it attracts his attention that's all that counts.

48
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:42,073
It seems that he just can't resist large gems.

49
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,073
Even if I were to be able to fish him with this bait,

50
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:47,473
I still have no skills to actually capture him.

51
00:04:47,473 --> 00:04:51,473
I have no means to surprise him out of his wits.

52
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:55,573
About the strategy of putting the mule

53
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:58,673
into the middle of a gigantic block of ice.

54
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,973
I think is a pretty good idea.

55
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:02,773
But I don't think Thief Kid, no matter how good he is,

56
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:04,773
can take something so big away that easily.

57
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:06,473
Answer me then.

58
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,573
Just where would you exhibit it?

59
00:05:09,573 --> 00:05:10,973
Well, of course I think I would put it

60
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:12,773
inside a sealed refrigerator or something.

61
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:17,973
Fool! If I do so, I won't be able to show the people

62
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:20,973
when I seize him live with my hands.

63
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:23,373
Besides, if I dunk it in ice,

64
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:26,973
the legendary mules will go to waste, you idiot!

65
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:31,473
Then, what about this suggestion?

66
00:05:31,473 --> 00:05:34,273
We place the mules on top of the Tokyo Tower

67
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:37,873
and surround it with the helicopters of the Suzuki Financial Group.

68
00:05:37,873 --> 00:05:43,073
This way, the spectators get to watch what's going on.

69
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:44,673
Have you forgotten?

70
00:05:44,673 --> 00:05:48,673
He possesses that white-winged hang glider.

71
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:53,473
He's so at home in the sky, that we don't stand a chance.

72
00:05:53,473 --> 00:05:55,573
I'm sure that he'll take what he wants

73
00:05:55,573 --> 00:06:00,373
and fly off with the moon behind him again.

74
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:01,573
Wait a sec.

75
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:04,673
Why in the first place does he have the moon behind him?

76
00:06:04,673 --> 00:06:06,973
I'm sure it's because it's night time.

77
00:06:06,973 --> 00:06:09,873
I mean thieves usually work at night.

78
00:06:09,873 --> 00:06:12,073
That's not it.

79
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:13,773
I'm asking why the moon

80
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:18,673
is so conveniently positioned behind him all the time.

81
00:06:18,673 --> 00:06:21,373
Maybe he has it all cleverly calculated?

82
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:23,673
After all, that's more stylish.

83
00:06:23,673 --> 00:06:25,273
Besides, everything he's after

84
00:06:25,273 --> 00:06:28,273
is usually on the top most floor of a building or a museum,

85
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:30,673
so it's only natural that the moon is there.

86
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:34,173
High places seem to go hand in hand with Thief Kid.

87
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,373
I see!

88
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:42,373
I see. There's something I can still do.

89
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:08,773
I didn't think he'd exhibit the treasure

90
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:10,973
right in the center of Ginza.

91
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:16,473
It's just as if he's asking Thief Kid to come and get it.

92
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:18,073
Right.

93
00:07:18,073 --> 00:07:19,773
Is it going to be all right, Sonoko?

94
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,773
Yep!

95
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,373
All I want is for my darling Thief Kid to appear

96
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:27,773
and get a glimpse of him. That's good enough for me!

97
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:29,673
Sonoko.

98
00:07:29,673 --> 00:07:34,573
Well, it seems that Uncle Jirokichi has something in mind, though.

99
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:38,473
Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing?

100
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:41,773
"Ginzou Nakamori (41)" -Any problem, Inspector Nakamori?

101
00:07:41,773 --> 00:07:43,973
Problem packed!

102
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:46,273
How dare you place treasure that's only guarded by four security guards

103
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:49,273
in the middle of the road like that.

104
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:52,573
Left that way, Thief Kid will get to it in no time.

105
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:55,673
Then, what would you do, Inspector?

106
00:07:55,673 --> 00:07:58,973
Well, I'd place it someplace like a high building,

107
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:01,373
where it would be more difficult for him to get to.

108
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:04,673
That's it! That's just what was so stupid of me.

109
00:08:05,673 --> 00:08:09,673
The police as well as I, without being aware,

110
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:12,773
was playing the game the way he wanted us to.

111
00:08:12,773 --> 00:08:16,373
We were made to think that the best place to confront

112
00:08:16,373 --> 00:08:20,273
that white-wing thief is some place staged high from the ground.

113
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:22,973
And time after time,

114
00:08:22,973 --> 00:08:26,873
he repeatedly used those wings of his to escape.

115
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:31,473
Then, don't tell me that you deliberately placed it on the ground...

116
00:08:32,173 --> 00:08:36,073
Right, in order to tear off his wings!

117
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:39,973
After all, he's no bird, so once he's on the ground,

118
00:08:39,973 --> 00:08:43,973
he won't be able to fly off using his hang glider.

119
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:45,873
But...

120
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:50,573
Kid...

121
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,173
What if he mingles among the crowd

122
00:08:52,173 --> 00:08:54,873
instead of fly through the sky?

123
00:08:54,873 --> 00:08:56,173
Then, all we need to do

124
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:59,573
is check all of the people there carefully one by one.

125
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:02,673
If you got notice from the Kid saying he'd be appearing,

126
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:04,373
I'd have dispatched the riot task force

127
00:09:04,373 --> 00:09:07,673
and fenced in this entire area.

128
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,673
I just happened to slam the challenge notice at his face

129
00:09:10,673 --> 00:09:12,273
in this morning's paper.

130
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:14,873
I'm sure he's still contemplating

131
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:17,773
whether he should take me on or not.

132
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:20,973
But he'll come.

133
00:09:22,073 --> 00:09:25,973
To live up to his name, Moonlight Magician.

134
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:30,573
I'll see you, then.

135
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:31,773
I've got to make final adjustments

136
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:33,873
on the strategy with my staff, you see.

137
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,673
Hey, wait!

138
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:39,773
Hey! What strategy?

139
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:47,073
What's this?

140
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:54,173
Here he comes!

141
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:56,273
-It's Kid! -Kid!

142
00:09:56,273 --> 00:09:58,273
Thief Kid!

143
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,973
How daring and bold indeed!

144
00:10:09,973 --> 00:10:12,373
Thief Kid has finally appeared over the skies of Ginza

145
00:10:12,373 --> 00:10:16,173
displaying his mysterious white-wings!

146
00:10:16,173 --> 00:10:20,173
Darling Thief Kid, I'm over here!

147
00:10:28,873 --> 00:10:32,873
There's a propeller attached behind the hang glider?

148
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:40,573
Oh no!

149
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:44,773
Darling Thief Kid?

150
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:46,673
Where is he?

151
00:10:56,473 --> 00:10:57,473
Thief

152
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:59,473
Kid!

153
00:10:59,473 --> 00:11:02,873
Wow! What a guy to jump down from a place like that.

154
00:11:02,873 --> 00:11:04,673
He's almost like superman.

155
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:08,573
No. All he did was explode the radio controlled dummy,

156
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:09,873
and while everyone's eyes were distracted,

157
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:12,073
he made his way out of the crowd

158
00:11:12,073 --> 00:11:15,373
and jumped onto the exhibition stand.

159
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:27,173
Kid...

160
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:31,373
Thief Kid, any comments?

161
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:32,873
Please, one word will do!

162
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:35,173
Thief Kid!

163
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:39,573
Oh, then please relay my message to Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki.

164
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,573
This case is a bolt out of the blue for me.

165
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:44,173
Therefore, I didn't have much time to prepare.

166
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:46,373
As a result, to please forgive me

167
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,373
for not being able to send out the usual letter warning.

168
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:53,173
Okay, now!

169
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:17,173
Oh, it's a net.

170
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:21,173
The intersection blocked off with a gigantic square net!

171
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,573
Uncle Jirokichi really goes all out.

172
00:12:25,573 --> 00:12:28,073
Height of almost 20 meters.

173
00:12:28,073 --> 00:12:29,673
Unless you do so on a hot air balloon or something,

174
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:32,573
it's impossible to make it through this net.

175
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:38,973
How about it?

176
00:12:38,973 --> 00:12:41,173
Even if you were to use a hot air balloon or something,

177
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:44,573
the helicopters in the sky would get in your way.

178
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:46,773
Of course, if you plan to escape from among the crowd,

179
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:48,573
I won't stop you.

180
00:12:48,573 --> 00:12:50,173
When you try to make it over the net,

181
00:12:50,173 --> 00:12:53,073
my staff will make a thorough check.

182
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:56,373
If you have the mule on you at that time, that's it for you.

183
00:12:56,373 --> 00:13:00,073
If you let go of it, you fail to carry out your crime.

184
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:03,073
Either way, I win!

185
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:08,873
Kid, disguise yourself as me and flee.

186
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:10,873
You can disguise yourself as me if you like too, Kid!

187
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,073
No need to worry,

188
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:15,173
I had it figured out that it would turn out this way to begin with.

189
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:17,373
Then, just what do you intend to do?

190
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:20,573
Well, since I've done my job and all,

191
00:13:20,573 --> 00:13:21,973
I guess I'll head home.

192
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:25,273
I mean, how?

193
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,273
Teleportation.

194
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:31,773
What... what did he just say?

195
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:33,873
-Teleportation? -Teleportation?

196
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:36,473
Teleportation.

197
00:13:38,173 --> 00:13:41,373
He's going to transport himself instantaneously and flee?

198
00:13:46,397 --> 00:13:48,797
Teleportation.

199
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:52,197
What... what did he just say?

200
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:55,897
-Teleportation? -Teleportation?

201
00:13:55,897 --> 00:13:57,697
Teleportation?

202
00:13:57,697 --> 00:13:58,697
Fantastic.

203
00:13:58,697 --> 00:13:59,997
Kid is great!

204
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:03,797
He's going to do it? Thief Kid is going to teleport himself!

205
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:06,397
He's going to transport himself instantaneously and flee?

206
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:09,797
That punk. He is doing ridiculous things again!

207
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:12,097
This is really going to be something.

208
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:15,597
Thief Kid has suddenly declared that he wills teleport himself.

209
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:17,697
Will Thief Kid

210
00:14:17,697 --> 00:14:20,397
really make it through the net set up to capture him?

211
00:14:20,397 --> 00:14:29,997
Kid...

212
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:32,197
What now, sir?

213
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:33,397
What shall we do?

214
00:14:33,397 --> 00:14:35,497
Come on, calm down.

215
00:14:35,497 --> 00:14:37,997
Take a good look at the circumstance.

216
00:14:37,997 --> 00:14:39,997
He's surrounded in all four directions by the net,

217
00:14:39,997 --> 00:14:43,997
and can't even fly off on his prized hang glider.

218
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:46,097
He's nailed to the ground.

219
00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:50,097
Teleportation, what a laugh.

220
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:53,097
As you can see, I've got the legendary mule, "Purple Nail"

221
00:14:53,097 --> 00:14:55,997
with me right here.

222
00:14:55,997 --> 00:14:57,397
How dare you, Thief Kid!

223
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,097
Don't you move!

224
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:01,997
Then, I'll see you again a few seconds later

225
00:15:01,997 --> 00:15:05,897
after I cross through time-space.

226
00:15:05,897 --> 00:15:08,697
Thief Kid!

227
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:19,297
He vanished?

228
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:22,697
He really vanished!

229
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:25,797
Could it indeed be teleportation?

230
00:15:27,597 --> 00:15:32,797
No, all he did was mingle in the crowd along with the smoke.

231
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:36,597
You can't call that teleportation, can you?

232
00:15:36,597 --> 00:15:38,497
The GPS.

233
00:15:38,497 --> 00:15:39,997
What's the location GPS

234
00:15:39,997 --> 00:15:41,297
that was attached to the dummy mule?

235
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:44,697
It's moving in the direction of 3-chome from the intersection.

236
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:46,797
Okay, dispatch security guards

237
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:48,497
in the direction of the net towards 3-chome.

238
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:51,597
Rather, reinforce guard of all the nets!

239
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,197
Yes, sir!

240
00:15:58,597 --> 00:16:01,297
Now, he's a cornered rat.

241
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:03,997
I'll get him even if he tries

242
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,997
to use his cheap tricks to get away.

243
00:16:08,697 --> 00:16:10,697
And, where is he?

244
00:16:10,697 --> 00:16:13,697
Well, he suddenly changed directions

245
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:14,997
and is running around here and there

246
00:16:14,997 --> 00:16:18,797
and everywhere within the intersection, like a weasel!

247
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:20,397
Don't be ridiculous!

248
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:24,197
How can he do something like this among this crowd?

249
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:26,997
Where on earth is Thief Kid?

250
00:16:35,397 --> 00:16:37,597
This is the mark of Thief Kid.

251
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,797
Where did it come from?

252
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:43,497
Stuck on the upper left is the GPS.

253
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:45,697
On the backside...

254
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:47,497
"Three"?

255
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:54,697
I caught a Thief Kid card!

256
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:57,097
Hey, something's written on the back.

257
00:16:57,097 --> 00:16:59,997
Really? "Two"?

258
00:17:00,997 --> 00:17:02,797
"One".

259
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:14,797
No way.

260
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:18,897
Can't be?

261
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:30,497
The roof?

262
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:34,297
It's Thief Kid.

263
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:38,197
Thief Kid's suddenly appeared on the roof of a building.

264
00:17:39,897 --> 00:17:42,897
You're great, you're incredible, darling Thief Kid.

265
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:44,597
Indeed...

266
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:48,097
He teleported over to a place like that.

267
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:49,897
That's his double.

268
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:51,597
I'm sure that it's just that his double,

269
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:54,697
who was hiding on the roof of the building to begin with appeared.

270
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:58,197
The real Thief Kid is still among the crowd.

271
00:17:58,197 --> 00:18:01,597
Don't undo the net blocker until you catch him.

272
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:08,897
Please relay to Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki that

273
00:18:08,897 --> 00:18:12,897
I definitely got hold of the gift he sent me,

274
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:16,897
but unfortunately, one of them turned out to be imitation.

275
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:19,497
I will return the imitation to you,

276
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:20,697
so if at all possible,

277
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:22,497
I'd appreciate it if you would please tell him

278
00:18:22,497 --> 00:18:26,297
to bring the other pair here again tomorrow.

279
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:28,997
I would like to give the mules to the woman I love,

280
00:18:28,997 --> 00:18:30,397
but giving her just one of a pair of this

281
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:32,997
would surely upset her, you see.

282
00:18:32,997 --> 00:18:34,497
So long.

283
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:12,697
What?

284
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:15,497
He said he's going to come to steal the treasure tomorrow night again?

285
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:17,797
Did Kid really say that?

286
00:19:17,797 --> 00:19:22,197
Yeah, he said so right in front of the TV camera.

287
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:23,897
He said that he'll leave the imitation behind,

288
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:27,497
so bring the real one tomorrow night to the same place.

289
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:29,197
That's what he said.

290
00:19:29,197 --> 00:19:30,497
But, uncle,

291
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:34,297
why didn't you exhibit imitations of both sides to begin with?

292
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:38,297
If I did so, all he would do is throw both sides out and flee, right?

293
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:40,897
It wouldn't be my victory then, would it?

294
00:19:40,897 --> 00:19:45,197
Then, the least you could do was attaching a GPS.

295
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:46,197
That way,

296
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:50,697
we could've at least figured out how he got to the roof.

297
00:19:50,697 --> 00:19:53,397
Of course a GPS was attached.

298
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:57,097
But, he seems to have removed it along the way.

299
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:59,797
Isn't this the GPS you're talking about?

300
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:03,097
Pops picked it up at that intersection.

301
00:20:03,097 --> 00:20:07,097
Something's stuck on to it with tape.

302
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:11,097
This is indeed the GPS I attached to the dummy.

303
00:20:11,197 --> 00:20:12,897
When did you get this?

304
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:15,597
It came falling from the sky about 5-6 seconds

305
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:18,197
before he appeared by teleportation.

306
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:20,197
There were two others besides that one, right?

307
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:22,897
Right, it came falling in the order

308
00:20:22,897 --> 00:20:25,697
three, two,

309
00:20:25,697 --> 00:20:28,197
and one as written on the back of the card.

310
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:32,197
Right after card number 1, Thief Kid appeared on the roof!

311
00:20:35,297 --> 00:20:36,297
In other words,

312
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:39,997
he quickly attached the GPS that he found to the cards

313
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:43,497
that he was planning to scatter to begin with as part of his show.

314
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:46,297
Which means that when he scattered the cards,

315
00:20:46,297 --> 00:20:49,297
Kid was on the roof.

316
00:20:49,297 --> 00:20:52,697
If he were to throw the cards from among the crowd,

317
00:20:52,697 --> 00:20:55,497
someone is bound to have noticed.

318
00:20:55,497 --> 00:21:00,297
How did he get up on the roof in an instant anyway?

319
00:21:00,297 --> 00:21:04,097
Maybe simply by using the elevator of that building.

320
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,297
Impossible.

321
00:21:06,297 --> 00:21:08,797
I rented the buildings on all four corners

322
00:21:08,797 --> 00:21:10,897
of the intersection for an entire day

323
00:21:10,897 --> 00:21:14,197
and sealed off all the entrances and exits there are.

324
00:21:14,197 --> 00:21:16,197
You rented the buildings?

325
00:21:16,197 --> 00:21:19,397
Besides, even if he did get into the building,

326
00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:20,897
it would take him close to a minute

327
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:23,397
to get to the roof with the elevator.

328
00:21:23,397 --> 00:21:25,797
But...

329
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:27,697
if it's only the mules,

330
00:21:27,697 --> 00:21:30,497
wouldn't it be possible to take them to the roof?

331
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,197
Kid has one accomplice, doesn't he?

332
00:21:33,197 --> 00:21:34,997
If Kid and his accomplice does it

333
00:21:34,997 --> 00:21:37,097
right on the roof and on the ground.

334
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:38,297
I see!

335
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,397
He could've suspended a fishing line

336
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:41,297
or something beforehand from the roof

337
00:21:41,297 --> 00:21:44,697
then the guy on the ground who stole the mule ties it onto the line.

338
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:48,697
Finally the guy who is hiding on the roof pulls it up.

339
00:21:48,697 --> 00:21:52,097
It'll look as if he indeed teleported.

340
00:21:52,097 --> 00:21:54,297
Yeah. If only the mules,

341
00:21:54,297 --> 00:21:55,797
all that is needed is a fishing reel

342
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:57,397
to pull them up in seconds.

343
00:21:57,397 --> 00:22:00,797
No, not only the mules.

344
00:22:01,797 --> 00:22:04,797
Hey. Come inside and explain.

345
00:22:05,897 --> 00:22:08,497
Yes, sir.

346
00:22:09,597 --> 00:22:12,797
I'm one of the 4 guards that was positioned around the stand

347
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:16,097
that the mules were exhibited.

348
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:18,297
You remember when Thief Kid first got here

349
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:20,997
the crowd stampeded over, right?

350
00:22:20,997 --> 00:22:22,097
Yeah.

351
00:22:22,097 --> 00:22:25,197
There was a person who was holding a hamburger in the crowd

352
00:22:25,197 --> 00:22:27,497
and when I blocked the movement of that person,

353
00:22:27,497 --> 00:22:31,497
back then, I unfortunately got ketchup on my hands.

354
00:22:31,597 --> 00:22:35,497
I happened to grab Thief Kid's cape

355
00:22:35,497 --> 00:22:39,397
with my ketchup smeared hands right before he vanished.

356
00:22:39,397 --> 00:22:42,197
And since you had ketchup smeared slippery hands,

357
00:22:42,197 --> 00:22:43,597
he got away?

358
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:46,697
Oh, no. Well, you see...

359
00:22:46,697 --> 00:22:49,097
Take a look at this.

360
00:22:49,097 --> 00:22:51,897
One of it is imitation...

361
00:22:51,897 --> 00:22:53,597
This is the image of him saying that

362
00:22:53,597 --> 00:22:55,197
he's going to come steal again tomorrow.

363
00:22:55,197 --> 00:22:56,197
If possible I will come back here again, tomorrow.

364
00:22:56,197 --> 00:22:57,997
Watch this!

365
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:04,797
Can't you tell?

366
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:07,597
To the left edge of the screen.

367
00:23:07,597 --> 00:23:10,497
It's a cape fluttering in the wind.

368
00:23:11,597 --> 00:23:13,697
The red outline of a hand print.

369
00:23:14,797 --> 00:23:18,097
Is this the trace this guard left behind?

370
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:22,897
Even he couldn't have foreseen such a happening.

371
00:23:22,897 --> 00:23:25,097
This means that the one who appeared on the roof

372
00:23:25,097 --> 00:23:27,097
is the one who first landed on the ground.

373
00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:30,597
It's Thief Kid, the one and the same person.

374
00:23:30,597 --> 00:23:33,497
He actually moved from one place to the other

375
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,397
in less than 20 seconds

376
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:39,297
to that place 30 meters above ground.
