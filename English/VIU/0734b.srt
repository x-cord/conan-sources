1
00:00:02,523 --> 00:00:04,723
Hey, what is it?

2
00:00:04,723 --> 00:00:09,423
What do you officers want to ask us so suddenly?

3
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:12,423
Are you saying we did something?

4
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:15,023
Before we go any further, first of all,

5
00:00:15,023 --> 00:00:19,423
please let us check to see if in your pockets or bags,

6
00:00:19,423 --> 00:00:23,523
you have any 5 yen coins that are painted black?

7
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,923
5 yen coins that are painted black?

8
00:00:25,923 --> 00:00:27,823
What's that about?

9
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:31,023
Why would I have something so strange like...

10
00:00:32,923 --> 00:00:34,723
Why is something like this...

11
00:00:34,723 --> 00:00:38,123
I found it, black 5 yen coins.

12
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:42,523
-I've found one too. -Me too.

13
00:00:43,523 --> 00:00:45,123
This is...

14
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:48,323
You mean all three have it?

15
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:49,923
What on earth is going on?

16
00:00:49,923 --> 00:00:52,123
What's this grotesque 5 yen coin about?

17
00:00:52,123 --> 00:00:54,923
That's what the pickpocket Kurobei

18
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:56,623
left behind for you as a gift, you see.

19
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:00,623
Huh? No joke? Then you mean I was pickpocketed?

20
00:01:00,623 --> 00:01:06,123
Oh. I realized a while ago that I didn't have my wallet

21
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:08,823
and was just about to report it to the police.

22
00:01:08,823 --> 00:01:12,323
Well, I didn't have much inside anyway,

23
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:14,723
so she could go ahead and take it, but...

24
00:01:14,723 --> 00:01:16,723
Did you nab that pickpocket?

25
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:18,723
No, not really.

26
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:22,623
Just a while ago, she was found dead.

27
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:24,323
What?

28
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:29,323
We think that one of you is the perp.

29
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,123
One of us?

30
00:01:32,123 --> 00:01:33,523
No.

31
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:36,123
You mean we're not victims?

32
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:39,423
We'll start with a body check of all of you

33
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:43,223
then check your belongings and cell phone.

34
00:01:44,123 --> 00:01:47,223
Of course, this is voluntary so you may reject this.

35
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:51,723
Only if you do reject, I think you'll have more problems later.

36
00:01:51,723 --> 00:01:54,623
-So if at all possible... -Okay!

37
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:56,923
Go on and check me if you want to!

38
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:58,523
But, mind you,

39
00:01:58,523 --> 00:02:01,623
I'm fat, so my cell phone may be sticky.

40
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,423
Put up with that, will you?

41
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:06,523
Jodie?

42
00:02:06,523 --> 00:02:08,423
Did you notice something?

43
00:02:08,423 --> 00:02:12,723
No. I was just recalling a man from a video

44
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:14,523
you previously took for me.

45
00:02:14,523 --> 00:02:16,823
Remember, the time when we deliberately dropped our cell phone

46
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:19,323
and made them pick it up to figure out who the spy

47
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:22,523
the Organization snuck into the hospital was?

48
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:25,123
The first one who picked it up

49
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:27,623
was an oily skinned fat man.

50
00:02:27,623 --> 00:02:31,423
But the one who picked it up after him was the spy,

51
00:02:31,423 --> 00:02:35,023
and the last one, an old man had a pace maker imbedded.

52
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:39,023
And that cell phone... Shu...

53
00:02:39,823 --> 00:02:44,223
Why don't we take her on the car of an acquaintance of mine?

54
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:47,423
-Huh? -We could lie her down in the backseat.

55
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:50,323
Because those bad buys probably think that

56
00:02:50,323 --> 00:02:52,223
she's going to be carried off in a large car

57
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:53,923
that can accommodate a stretcher.

58
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,923
I think they'll never find out!

59
00:02:55,923 --> 00:02:58,323
I guess so, but...

60
00:02:58,323 --> 00:03:01,623
I'll go outside and call him then.

61
00:03:01,623 --> 00:03:03,623
I'm sure he'll come right away.

62
00:03:05,723 --> 00:03:10,323
That's something I can't do, not even for you, sonny.

63
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,423
This is a job for the FBI.

64
00:03:14,423 --> 00:03:16,723
We can't afford to get ordinary citizens

65
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:18,723
involved in something like this anymore.

66
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:21,023
Oh, but...

67
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:23,623
Leave the rest to us.

68
00:03:24,123 --> 00:03:27,023
Jodie?

69
00:03:27,923 --> 00:03:30,923
That's not of any concern now, is it?

70
00:03:30,923 --> 00:03:32,823
I guess so.

71
00:03:32,823 --> 00:03:34,523
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:36,423
I think I'm a bit flustered at finding out

73
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:40,823
that the man with the burn wasn't Shu.

74
00:03:40,823 --> 00:03:42,523
I've got to shape up.

75
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,623
What's the matter?

76
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:46,823
Raising your voice suddenly like that.

77
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:49,723
Oh, no. It's nothing.

78
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:55,223
And how about it, Doc?

79
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:59,223
Is the perp that you saw among the three?

80
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:05,623
Well, that old man with the cane is suspicious I guess,

81
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:10,023
but the perp had a thin stick about 30cm.

82
00:04:10,023 --> 00:04:12,623
He wasn't using a cane, either.

83
00:04:12,623 --> 00:04:14,723
The hat that the perp was wearing

84
00:04:14,723 --> 00:04:16,723
was not a hunting cap that old people would wear

85
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,823
or a knitted cap for women,

86
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:21,123
but rather, a mountain climbing hat.

87
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:26,323
Besides, the perp didn't have a cough like that man.

88
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:30,523
But, maybe he's just pretending to have a cold?

89
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:32,523
I don't think so.

90
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,123
At the point we met him for the first time,

91
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:39,123
he had no way of knowing that we were acquaintances of Doc.

92
00:04:39,123 --> 00:04:40,723
So, he wouldn't have needed to pretend

93
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:43,923
that he had a cold in front of us, right?

94
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:46,723
Well, I guess so.

95
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:50,023
Then Doctor, how about the style of walking?

96
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:54,923
You said the perp was dragging his legs a bit, no?

97
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:57,823
That old man, rather than drag his leg,

98
00:04:57,823 --> 00:05:01,623
seems unable to stand without a cane.

99
00:05:01,623 --> 00:05:05,623
The other two don't look to be dragging their legs either.

100
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:11,423
What? You can't find the murder weapon?

101
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:13,223
Did you look in every crevice and cranny?

102
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:16,123
Yes, sir. We looked inside the drain of the water spot,

103
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:19,123
and even inside the offertory box.

104
00:05:19,123 --> 00:05:21,923
Those three didn't have any, did they?

105
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:25,323
No! We even checked the old man's cane

106
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:26,923
but there were no traces of it having been used

107
00:05:26,923 --> 00:05:28,023
as a murder weapon.

108
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:31,323
Besides, we checked the cell phones of the three

109
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:34,523
but none of the cell phones had an application that enables

110
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:36,323
pursuit of a transmitter.

111
00:05:36,323 --> 00:05:41,123
Maybe it was deleted to prevent us from finding it, though.

112
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:42,223
Yes.

113
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:46,323
But, to check any further, we need a warrant.

114
00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:48,123
Hey, you guys!

115
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:52,423
When you met those three, did anyone of them act strange?

116
00:05:52,423 --> 00:05:54,423
Act strange?

117
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:56,323
For example, like somebody coming,

118
00:05:56,323 --> 00:06:00,223
to secretly give them what looked to be a thin stick?

119
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:02,323
All three of them were by themselves!

120
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:06,423
The old man taught us to take home the oracle

121
00:06:06,423 --> 00:06:07,923
if the result was good too.

122
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:12,423
That lady told us to ring the bell loudly

123
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:15,223
so that god could hear us!

124
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:16,823
The other man,

125
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:20,423
said that he already cleansed his hands at the water spot.

126
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:22,523
It seems he was at the shrine way

127
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:25,323
before we got here though.

128
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:28,323
Inspector Megure!

129
00:06:28,323 --> 00:06:31,623
We found the hat and coat that could be the perp's!

130
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:33,623
Oh, is that so!

131
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:35,223
There's probably no mistake about it,

132
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:37,323
because blood is splattered on it.

133
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:40,723
But it's covered with flower petals.

134
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:43,223
Yes. It was covered with withered petals

135
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:45,423
as if to hide it.

136
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:46,723
What?

137
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:50,023
Then, maybe the murder weapon is hidden in the same way!

138
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:52,523
Find it even if you have to scatter the flower petals!

139
00:06:52,523 --> 00:06:54,223
Yes, sir!

140
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:59,923
What? I mean it looks like a nice pink carpet, and yet!

141
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:01,323
True.

142
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:04,023
If you look at them one by one, they're flower petals,

143
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,623
and yet when many of them are scattered over the ground,

144
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,923
they look just like one pink carpet.

145
00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:09,323
Yep.

146
00:07:10,523 --> 00:07:13,323
I see. So, that's the story.

147
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:14,323
That's why that person

148
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:17,723
said something like that to the children.

149
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:21,123
If so, the reason the perp was dragging his foot

150
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:23,423
was probably because...

151
00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:27,423
It seems that he got to the truth of the case but...

152
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:31,723
isn't aware of ours.

153
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:45,092
Hey, how long do you intend to keep us stranded here?

154
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:47,192
The sun's starting to set already!

155
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:49,892
I don't know if you're working on a case or what but...

156
00:07:49,892 --> 00:07:52,292
It has nothing to do with us, right?

157
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:55,792
We're very sorry. Please give us a little more time.

158
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:57,492
Inspector Megure!

159
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:03,892
We've got to open the doorways of the shrine already.

160
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:05,192
I see.

161
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:06,792
And, the murder weapon?

162
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:10,892
Too bad, but we haven't got word that it's been found yet.

163
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:13,992
Maybe the perp already fled this shrine

164
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:17,092
and took the murder weapon along too.

165
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:19,292
No, because taking into consideration,

166
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:20,292
the time from when the incident occurred

167
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,992
and entrance and exit were closed off,

168
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:26,392
as well as the perp dragging his leg while leaving.

169
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:28,092
It's highly likely that the perp

170
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,692
is still on the grounds of this shrine!

171
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:33,192
And that the stick that's about 30cm that Mr. Agasa witnessed

172
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:37,492
the perp having, is hidden somewhere here too!

173
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:39,792
If so, the most suspicious

174
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:42,892
are those three victims of pickpocket.

175
00:08:42,892 --> 00:08:44,092
Yeah.

176
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:46,392
If there was a GPS wrapped in the bills

177
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:50,892
of the wallet of the pickpocket who was slugged to death...

178
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:54,192
Just as Jodie mentioned, the suspect deliberately

179
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:56,592
made the pickpocket steal the wallet with the GPS inside,

180
00:08:56,592 --> 00:09:00,692
in order to slug her to death in a lonely place.

181
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:05,392
But, those three, don't look to have hurt their legs.

182
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:08,092
Besides, the old man, rather than dragging his feet,

183
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:10,692
cannot walk without his cane.

184
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:13,892
And moreover, if the perp had an accomplice

185
00:09:13,892 --> 00:09:16,992
who he secretly passed the murder weapon onto,

186
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:19,192
it would have to be one of the flower viewers here.

187
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,492
We'd have to check all of them.

188
00:09:21,492 --> 00:09:23,992
That won't be necessary.

189
00:09:23,992 --> 00:09:28,192
The perp still has a part of the weapon hidden on him!

190
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,692
A part of it?

191
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:31,192
Oh, that's right!

192
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:33,292
The perp bundled that stuff together

193
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,092
and made the murder weapon!

194
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:37,292
Bundled?

195
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:39,092
The murder weapon that you saw, Mr. Agasa

196
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:40,792
was a stick, wasn't it?

197
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,492
What does bundle have to do with it?

198
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:47,192
The perp bundled it into one. A lot of a certain thing!

199
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:48,692
And, the perp hid it in a place where it

200
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:50,292
wouldn't look suspicious

201
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:52,992
even if there were a lot of it around.

202
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,992
He called out to the children

203
00:09:54,992 --> 00:09:57,792
and nicely set up a camouflage too.

204
00:09:57,792 --> 00:10:00,692
-Huh? -You mean to us?

205
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:02,392
Then, are you talking about that old man

206
00:10:02,392 --> 00:10:04,992
who talked to us at the location where the oracles were tied?

207
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:08,292
Come to think of it, there were a lot of oracles tied on,

208
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:10,892
so no one would know the difference if more were added, right?

209
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:13,592
But no matter how many oracles you bundle together,

210
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:14,792
you could never make a murder weapon

211
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:17,392
enough to slug a person to death with.

212
00:10:17,392 --> 00:10:19,592
It's only paper after all.

213
00:10:19,592 --> 00:10:21,392
Then, is it that man?

214
00:10:21,392 --> 00:10:22,592
The one who said he didn't need the scoopers

215
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:26,392
that Genta handed to him at the water spot.

216
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,092
I'm sure it was him!

217
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:32,692
There were many scoopers at the water spot too!

218
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:36,792
If there was a scooper made of iron among them...

219
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:40,592
The police would've found it long ago.

220
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:42,092
I guess so.

221
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:45,092
Of course there was no such scoopers.

222
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:47,692
The only one left is that lady we saw at the place

223
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:50,092
to ring the bell.

224
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:53,792
But, there were only two bells!

225
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:57,292
Didn't you guys do something before you rang the bell?

226
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,492
-I see! -We threw in money offering.

227
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:02,492
We put in 5 yen coins!

228
00:11:02,492 --> 00:11:04,292
Inside the offertory box!

229
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:07,592
Right. Offerings usually made by throwing in 5 yen coins,

230
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:09,992
because they symbolize "goen" meaning good ties with others.

231
00:11:09,992 --> 00:11:12,092
That's why most of the coins are 5 yen coins with holes in them!

232
00:11:12,092 --> 00:11:13,592
I see.

233
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:15,892
If you join all the coins by pulling a string or wire

234
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:17,792
through them and bundle them together,

235
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:19,692
you can make a thin long stick.

236
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:22,292
On top of that, even if a lot of 5 yen coins

237
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:25,892
were to later be found in the offertory box,

238
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:27,192
they would be mixed with other monetary offerings

239
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:28,592
so it wouldn't look suspicious.

240
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:30,792
The perp can deceive the eyes of the police

241
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:33,792
who are set on looking for a thin long metal stick!

242
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:37,192
But in order to make a stick as long as 30cm,

243
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:39,992
you'll need around 200 five yen coins.

244
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:43,392
Besides, if you throw in that many coins at once,

245
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:46,092
the people around will get suspicious, won't they?

246
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:50,192
That's why the perp called out to the children

247
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:52,792
and told them that unless they ring the bell loudly,

248
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,892
god won't hear them.

249
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:56,592
Then...

250
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,492
The perp is...

251
00:11:58,492 --> 00:11:59,792
That's right.

252
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:03,092
The one who hid a GPS transmitter into the wallet

253
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:05,092
to confirm the whereabouts of the pickpocket,

254
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,492
then used a lot of 5 yen coins by bundling them

255
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,792
into the form of a stick to make the murder weapon,

256
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:10,792
then finally slugged Ms. Ikuyo Yatani,

257
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:15,292
so-called pickpocket Kurobei, to death is...

258
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:16,892
you!

259
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:22,135
Then...

260
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:23,735
The perp is...

261
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:25,035
That's right.

262
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,435
The one who hid a GPS transmitter into the wallet

263
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:30,435
to confirm the whereabouts of the pickpocket,

264
00:12:30,435 --> 00:12:31,835
then used a lot of 5 yen coins by bundling them

265
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:34,135
into the form of a stick to make the murder weapon,

266
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:36,035
then finally slugged Ms. Ikuyo Yatani,

267
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:40,035
so-called pickpocket Kurobei, to death is...

268
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:41,835
you!

269
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:43,635
Ms. Yoriko Danno!

270
00:12:43,635 --> 00:12:46,135
You called out to the children

271
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:48,935
and made them ring the bell very loudly,

272
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,035
and erased the sound of the load of 5 yen coins

273
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:54,935
being put into the offertory box!

274
00:12:54,935 --> 00:12:56,335
You untied the tip of the string

275
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:58,335
that bundled the 5 yen coins together,

276
00:12:58,335 --> 00:12:59,835
held the edge of the string

277
00:12:59,835 --> 00:13:02,335
and hung it down in the offertory box.

278
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:06,635
In this way you slid the load of coins into the box at once.

279
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:09,435
Moreover, the murder was committed

280
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:11,735
before you rang the bell.

281
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:13,835
Although by then your wallet

282
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,435
should've been pickpocketed by the victim.

283
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:18,735
You lied saying that you weren't aware this,

284
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:21,235
threw money into the offertory box and rang the bell.

285
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:22,635
This is proof that you're the one who did it!

286
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,235
True.

287
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:26,135
You should've noticed that you'd been pickpocketed

288
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:28,935
at the time you opened your wallet to throw in the offering.

289
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:31,135
Oh my, don't you know?

290
00:13:31,135 --> 00:13:32,735
A saying goes that one should not open their wallet

291
00:13:32,735 --> 00:13:35,835
in front of the offertory box.

292
00:13:35,835 --> 00:13:38,435
If god sees the contents of your wallet,

293
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:39,835
and finds that you have a lot,

294
00:13:39,835 --> 00:13:43,835
but are only giving a small offering, you may enrage him.

295
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:46,635
That's why when I come to visit the shrine

296
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:49,235
I keep 5 yen coins as is, in my pocket!

297
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:52,835
I see. That's why you say you didn't realize

298
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:54,835
that your wallet was gone?

299
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,435
That's right!

300
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:59,335
Well, if you saw me putting a load of 5 yen coins

301
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:01,835
into the offertory box,

302
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:04,135
I wouldn't mind admitting it, though.

303
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,835
We don't have to see it to prove it.

304
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:11,535
So long as we check that shoelace of yours.

305
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:18,735
You probably used your shoelace

306
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:21,835
to bundle the 5 yen coins together.

307
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:26,035
That's why you couldn't leave the site right away.

308
00:14:26,035 --> 00:14:28,535
Because you were missing one of your shoelaces,

309
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:32,235
your shoe would come off if you walked the way you usually do.

310
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:33,835
After ringing the bell,

311
00:14:33,835 --> 00:14:37,435
it seems you put your shoelace back on and re-tied it.

312
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:41,035
If you used that shoelace to commit the crime,

313
00:14:41,035 --> 00:14:43,435
it should be there...

314
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:45,735
the blood of the victim that splattered

315
00:14:45,735 --> 00:14:48,835
when you slugged her to death.

316
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:55,135
Excuse me.

317
00:14:58,335 --> 00:14:59,735
It's here.

318
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:01,435
Blood stains.

319
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:07,635
But, why did you have extra 5 yen coins on you?

320
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:10,435
Weren't the 5 yen coins found near the corpse

321
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:12,135
the ones that were put in your pocket

322
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:14,935
when your wallet was pickpocketed?

323
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:20,035
Those were the ones I showed you police a while ago.

324
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:22,735
Then, what about those 5 yen coins?

325
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:25,835
I put it near that woman because those coins

326
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:28,835
were the ones that woman put into my wallet

327
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:31,835
when she pickpocketed me last year.

328
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:34,935
The 5 yen coins that took the life of my son!

329
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,535
Son...

330
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:39,535
You mean the one that was in the photo

331
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:41,635
that was in your wallet?

332
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:45,835
Yes. That's right.

333
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:48,835
When I was pickpocketed last year,

334
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:51,235
my car keys were also in my wallet.

335
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:54,435
And, because I didn't have the keys, my son who had asthma

336
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:57,135
was locked in the car for several hours.

337
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:59,535
We got to the hospital too late

338
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:02,735
and as a result, he died.

339
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:07,735
So, I checked everywhere on the internet about that pickpocket

340
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:11,435
and ambushed her in places that she was prone to appear.

341
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:14,135
But, why the photo?

342
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:16,235
If it hadn't been in your wallet,

343
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:19,835
we might not have known it was yours.

344
00:16:19,835 --> 00:16:22,635
If you try to take money out of the wallet,

345
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:26,235
that photo would jump into your eyes, wouldn't it?

346
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,335
I wanted to let her know

347
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:30,835
that when she pickpocketed back then,

348
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:34,435
she not only took my money.

349
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:39,035
But, also took the life of a little boy as well.

350
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:47,235
Then, may I go home already?

351
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:48,335
Yes.

352
00:16:48,335 --> 00:16:50,035
I'll be going too, then.

353
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:52,135
We're still working on the pickpocket case,

354
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:55,535
so we may ask you some question at a later date though.

355
00:16:55,535 --> 00:16:57,435
Oh, that's okay with me.

356
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:59,035
Please contact me.

357
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:01,335
Uh, sir!

358
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:04,235
Do you have bad eyes, sir?

359
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:06,035
Huh? Why do you ask?

360
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:07,835
Because that lady pickpocket

361
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:10,535
saw your face and looked really surprised.

362
00:17:10,535 --> 00:17:12,935
I think that was because

363
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:16,335
she just pickpocketed your wallet a while ago.

364
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,435
Why didn't you say anything back then, sir?

365
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:22,035
In spite it being the second time you saw her.

366
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:23,935
Right.

367
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:25,935
I've got bad eyesight, you see.

368
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:28,435
If you got bad eyes, you can't view the cherry blossoms

369
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:30,235
unless you wear glasses!

370
00:17:30,235 --> 00:17:32,535
Did you come to view flowers alone?

371
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:35,135
Actually I came to get lucky charms.

372
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:38,135
What kind of lucky charms?

373
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:40,335
For me, right?

374
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:42,735
Motoe?

375
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:47,335
For this child.

376
00:17:47,335 --> 00:17:49,035
I see, a baby.

377
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:51,535
A charm to help assist a safe birth, eh?

378
00:17:51,535 --> 00:17:54,335
I told you to stay still at home, didn't I?

379
00:17:54,335 --> 00:17:57,135
I came to check on you, because you didn't come home

380
00:17:57,135 --> 00:17:58,635
and I got worried!

381
00:17:58,635 --> 00:18:01,035
Then, could you by chance be...

382
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:05,635
the one who masking taped me during the bank robbery?

383
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:08,835
Oh, you're that non-Japanese person that was there?

384
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:10,535
I'm sorry for what I did then,

385
00:18:10,535 --> 00:18:13,835
I was threatened, and had no choice.

386
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:19,935
Are you all right?

387
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:31,135
I'm sorry, Motoe doesn't seem to be feeling well,

388
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:33,035
so could we leave?

389
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:35,035
Huh? Yes.

390
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:39,235
Morning sickness is a symptom that seen

391
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:40,835
during the early stages of pregnancy, right?

392
00:18:40,835 --> 00:18:43,535
Yeah. But the size of her stomach

393
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:46,435
looked big enough to be six months pregnant.

394
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:50,935
Well, she could be feeling nausea for some other reason too.

395
00:18:50,935 --> 00:18:53,035
Yes, that's right, Camel.

396
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:56,435
That man with the burn, wasn't Shu, I guess.

397
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,535
He seemed to have been just a decoy sent out

398
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:00,735
by the Organization

399
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,835
to confirm whether Shu really died or not.

400
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:05,135
Oh, Jodie.

401
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:09,535
Anyway, I'll give you the details after I get back there, okay?

402
00:19:09,535 --> 00:19:11,835
I think the cash has been taken,

403
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:14,135
but please confirm the contents of the wallet.

404
00:19:14,135 --> 00:19:15,635
Yes.

405
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:19,835
All my cards are intact

406
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:21,935
and the contents of my pocket.

407
00:19:23,435 --> 00:19:27,035
This is... back during the department hijacking.

408
00:19:31,535 --> 00:19:34,735
Huh? The edge of the coaster is bent.

409
00:19:37,835 --> 00:19:40,835
Run for it! This area is dangerous.

410
00:19:43,035 --> 00:19:44,335
Shu!

411
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:47,435
Shu!

412
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:49,935
Shu.

413
00:19:51,735 --> 00:19:55,735
If that man with the burn isn't Shu...

414
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:59,635
Who on earth's doing this? For what?

415
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:04,735
I'm sorry, Agent Jodie.

416
00:21:31,835 --> 00:21:33,935
Hey, you.

417
00:21:33,935 --> 00:21:37,035
You'll catch cold sleeping in a place like...

418
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:39,435
Huh?

419
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:41,335
Hey, you?

420
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:44,935
Don't worry! He's just drunk and sleeping.

421
00:21:44,935 --> 00:21:45,935
Huh?

422
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:48,035
My big brother's not a strong drinker.

423
00:21:48,035 --> 00:21:49,135
Huh?

424
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:51,835
Twins?

425
00:21:56,935 --> 00:21:59,335
What an incident that was?

426
00:21:59,335 --> 00:22:01,035
To think that the man you disguised yourself as

427
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:03,335
was pickpocketed.

428
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:05,535
I did think something was strange

429
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:08,135
because he didn't have a wallet, though.

430
00:22:08,135 --> 00:22:12,235
Well, it was good for me that I took the queer 5 yen coins

431
00:22:12,235 --> 00:22:14,835
that the man had on him.

432
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:17,535
But, to go out of the way to return the wallet

433
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:20,035
that was pickpocketed back to him.

434
00:22:20,035 --> 00:22:22,935
I didn't want him to make a big fuss later!

435
00:22:22,935 --> 00:22:23,935
Because there was a cash card

436
00:22:23,935 --> 00:22:26,035
and driver's license inside too, you know.

437
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:28,935
Well, you'd better be grateful.

438
00:22:28,935 --> 00:22:33,335
When that kitty cat of the FBI grabbed your arm,

439
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:36,935
the wiretap that you put into the fold of her sleeve,

440
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:39,535
I made sure I retrieved it for you.

441
00:22:39,535 --> 00:22:41,435
Thank you.

442
00:22:41,435 --> 00:22:44,835
And?

443
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:48,535
From that kitty cat,

444
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,935
did you get to listen to any good stories?

445
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:55,235
Yes. I got a lot of what I wanted.

446
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:56,435
I got to hear unexpected stories

447
00:22:56,435 --> 00:22:57,835
that went on behind the scenes too besides.

448
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:02,635
I hope I get to hear the rest of that story from you.

449
00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:06,035
Yes, as soon as I get solid proof, I will.

450
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:09,035
But, let me just tell you this.

451
00:23:10,735 --> 00:23:13,335
He's a dreadfully intelligent man.

452
00:23:16,435 --> 00:23:18,635
That young man.

453
00:23:20,835 --> 00:23:25,535
So, you're not convinced of Kogoro's deduction after all?

454
00:23:25,535 --> 00:23:27,135
I see!

455
00:23:27,135 --> 00:23:29,235
That's what that left hand meant.

456
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:33,535
Oh no! I've got to let her know right away!

457
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:36,835
This is bad!

458
00:23:42,035 --> 00:23:43,635
Kaori!

459
00:23:44,835 --> 00:23:50,335
