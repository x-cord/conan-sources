1
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:17,112
Hey, Gin. Today feels different.

2
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:18,212
Yeah.

3
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:20,913
Because it's a two hour and a half special.

4
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:26,413
Hi.

5
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:30,312
We wish everyone...

6
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:33,713
-happy new year! -Happy new year!

7
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:40,812
Detective Conan staff will work harder to improve

8
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:41,912
-the TV episodes... -the TV episodes,

9
00:00:41,913 --> 00:00:43,912
movies and Shonen Sunday!

10
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:47,812
And me, Sonoko Suzuki.

11
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:49,212
And me, Ran Mouri.

12
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:51,913
Hey... What are you two talking about?

13
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:55,612
-Please keep supporting us! -Please keep supporting us!

14
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:57,213
Did we make it?

15
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,612
"Dear."

16
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:24,413
"Mr. Conan Edogawa."

17
00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:43,012
An eerie atmosphere, the mysterious twosome.

18
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:45,012
An enveloping attack that closes in on Conan and Haibara.

19
00:02:45,013 --> 00:02:46,612
They seek not to protect their own lives if for the sake of others.

20
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:48,712
A breathtaking 2 hours and a half is about to begin.

21
00:02:48,713 --> 00:02:50,412
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:52,212
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,313
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:30,512
"The Confrontation with the Black Organization."

25
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:33,913
"The Coincidence of the Two Enemies on a Night with a Full Moon."

26
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:40,512
An Off-season Halloween party?

27
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,312
Just what month do they think it is?

28
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:46,912
Isn't Halloween on October 31st?

29
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:50,912
That's why it's written "off-season", isn't it?

30
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:55,012
What's written on the invitation card?

31
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:57,712
On the letter it says,

32
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:01,312
"Incapable Detective, Kogoro Mouri."

33
00:05:01,313 --> 00:05:03,512
"On the night the full moon cometh,"

34
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:07,112
"I shall invite thee to this hideous night banquet."

35
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:09,712
"To the blood smeared party on the ship."

36
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:12,812
"Be it known that whether thou attend or not,"

37
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:17,012
"the pitiful lamb that goes passing shall curse its own fate,"

38
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:21,313
"and the sinner shall be ecstatic over the agonies of death."

39
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:27,112
So this is a letter challenging

40
00:05:27,113 --> 00:05:29,612
the Famous Detective Kogoro Mouri!

41
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:33,112
Who on earth would've sent this invitation card to me?

42
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:35,012
Maybe a foreigner,

43
00:05:35,013 --> 00:05:37,012
because the name of the sender is in english.

44
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:41,512
V. E. R. M. O. U. T. H.

45
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:44,213
Vermouth?

46
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,157
Vermouth?

47
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:06,157
I'm sorry, Ran.

48
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:09,057
But I've never heard that name before.

49
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:10,357
I see.

50
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:13,657
I wonder who sent us this invitation card?

51
00:06:13,658 --> 00:06:14,957
Besides...

52
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,757
Isn't Kogoro going to the evening party?

53
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:19,057
It's tomorrow, isn't it?

54
00:06:19,058 --> 00:06:20,357
Yes.

55
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:23,357
He says that brave Tokyo people should take on challenges.

56
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:25,557
Father's making preparations for it

57
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:27,657
and having Sonoko put on all kinds of makeup on him,

58
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:29,557
although he's still undecided which makeup he wants to go with.

59
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:31,557
-Makeup? -Yes.

60
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,157
It says on the invitation card that

61
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:35,657
since it's a Halloween party,

62
00:06:35,658 --> 00:06:38,557
all participants must disguise themselves as monsters

63
00:06:38,558 --> 00:06:42,357
and come dressed in formal black suits and dresses.

64
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:43,957
Of course anyone who comes as a companion must do likewise.

65
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,257
What? Companion?

66
00:06:46,258 --> 00:06:48,457
You mean, you're going with him too?

67
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:52,558
Of course I'm not going to such a monster-filled party!

68
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:56,657
I guessed so.

69
00:06:56,658 --> 00:06:58,857
And...

70
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:01,957
I have a favor to ask you, Dr. Agasa.

71
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,657
What is it?

72
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:07,657
If this invitation came to dad,

73
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:10,257
it could be that...

74
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:14,457
he got one too?

75
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,557
Oh, yeah. You mean Shinichi too?

76
00:07:17,558 --> 00:07:21,157
Yes. So could you check the mailbox?

77
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:23,257
Unless you tell him about mail like these,

78
00:07:23,258 --> 00:07:26,557
I'm sure he'll complain later.

79
00:07:26,558 --> 00:07:28,257
Oh, okay.

80
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:31,457
If it's here, I'll call you back.

81
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:35,057
Well, I don't think he got one, though.

82
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:39,957
Oh, and please keep this a secret from Conan.

83
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,857
Because every time he goes to places like these,

84
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:46,057
he tends to stick his nose into dangerous things.

85
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:47,558
Besides...

86
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:54,557
Besides, what?

87
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:55,857
Oh, nothing.

88
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:57,757
And tell him that school will start soon

89
00:07:57,758 --> 00:08:00,757
so to make sure to comes home

90
00:08:00,758 --> 00:08:03,957
and that he shouldn't go here and there till then.

91
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,257
Yeah, okay.

92
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:06,657
I'll give him your message.

93
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:07,757
Bye.

94
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:08,858
Yeah.

95
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,357
How about this?

96
00:08:21,358 --> 00:08:24,258
This is a masterpiece produced by Sonoko Suzuki!

97
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:26,657
I have this feeling that

98
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:29,557
I don't look much different from how I usually look.

99
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:30,957
What're you talking about?

100
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,757
You don't want it to look too drastic, do you?

101
00:08:33,758 --> 00:08:35,557
If I cover you with heavy makeup and goofed,

102
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:38,757
there'd be no way out!

103
00:08:38,758 --> 00:08:39,957
Well, that's true, but...

104
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,157
Isn't it fantastic?

105
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:44,957
You look really good, dad!

106
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,857
That amount of makeup is just enough

107
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:50,157
to bring out the good looks in you, Dad!

108
00:08:50,158 --> 00:08:51,558
Do you think so?

109
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:58,958
What about you?

110
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,157
What kind of makeup did you decide to go as, Sonoko?

111
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:04,657
About that... Of course!

112
00:09:04,658 --> 00:09:06,357
I'm going to go in a super cute mini skirt

113
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:08,957
and knock the monsters out!

114
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,157
Knock the monsters out, my gosh.

115
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:17,657
Who knows? Maybe there'll be super good-looking monsters?

116
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,557
No way, no chance.

117
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:21,957
So what?

118
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,457
I'll bet you're after some super whopper body vampire

119
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,358
or something too. Won't you, Pops?

120
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,458
And?

121
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:42,557
Are you planning to board the phantom ship too?

122
00:09:42,558 --> 00:09:43,657
Yeah.

123
00:09:43,658 --> 00:09:47,257
The sender's name kind of bothers me so...

124
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:50,057
Do you have an idea of who the sender is or something?

125
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:51,058
No.

126
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:54,657
Shouldn't you're the one who has an idea, Haibara?

127
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:57,357
Because Vermouth, like Gin and Vodka,

128
00:09:57,358 --> 00:09:59,457
are names of liquor.

129
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,557
Beats me.

130
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,557
Never heard of it.

131
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:05,257
Besides, I don't know much about liquor.

132
00:10:05,258 --> 00:10:08,057
It's liquor from Italy.

133
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:11,257
Vermouth is the English spelling.

134
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:14,957
In Japan it's called...

135
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,358
"Bermutto".

136
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:32,157
Just as I thought.

137
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:35,157
It's written on your face that the name sounds familiar.

138
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:38,857
I guess it's the code name of one of The Black Organization members.

139
00:10:38,858 --> 00:10:41,057
Then you mean that invitation card is from?

140
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,657
Yeah.

141
00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:47,057
An invitation from Vermouth who is one of them.

142
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:50,157
I don't know if they're ready to take us on

143
00:10:50,158 --> 00:10:52,857
or if they just got tired of waiting

144
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:54,757
but I can't pass up this opportunity.

145
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:56,757
Don't go.

146
00:10:56,758 --> 00:10:58,457
Don't go! Stop, I tell you!

147
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,758
It's a trap and if you go you'll be killed...

148
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:07,158
Yeah. It could be...

149
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:10,457
Then...

150
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,358
Then, why?

151
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:18,057
Hey, Shinichi.

152
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:19,858
You didn't have to do that.

153
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:25,358
Sorry, Haibara.

154
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,457
With things as they are,

155
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,958
I'm stuck and can't move on.

156
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:42,657
But,

157
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:44,657
I wonder if it's okay for you to leave Ai here like this

158
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:47,157
and leave just like that.

159
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:48,857
Look at the address, Dr. Agasa.

160
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:50,457
On the envelope that was delivered to my house,

161
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,357
and the invitation card in it,

162
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:57,657
both were addressed to the name Shinichi Kudo.

163
00:11:57,658 --> 00:12:00,558
But the name on the letter that came with it is addressed to...

164
00:12:02,058 --> 00:12:06,457
Dear Mr. Conan Edogawa?

165
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,757
Hey, Shinichi! This...

166
00:12:09,758 --> 00:12:13,257
Yeah. Everything's out in the open.

167
00:12:13,258 --> 00:12:14,657
My true identity,

168
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:18,057
the fact that my body shrunk because of Apoptoxin 4869,

169
00:12:18,058 --> 00:12:20,358
as well as the fact that I'm Shinichi Kudo.

170
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,957
And they most probably

171
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,957
know that Haibara is the Sherry,

172
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,558
who used to be one of them.

173
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,157
But, isn't it strange?

174
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:36,257
If they have that much information already,

175
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:38,757
why aren't they here raiding us?

176
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,557
Beats me.

177
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:42,957
I don't know the reason

178
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,257
but I have a hunch

179
00:12:45,258 --> 00:12:48,158
about one of the causes.

180
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,857
Hey. Don't tell me that you caught Ai's cold.

181
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,358
I'm fine.

182
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:01,257
What is that?

183
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:02,758
The telephone?

184
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:08,958
Mail?

185
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,358
Okay.

186
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:16,858
The only problem left is...

187
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:34,157
A Halloween Party?

188
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:35,357
Yeah.

189
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:39,357
It's going to start tomorrow night at 19:00.

190
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:41,057
But, Gin,

191
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:43,457
why do I have to go to a crazy place like that?

192
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,958
Vermouth is in this.

193
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:50,057
We've got orders to go check out the internal affairs.

194
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:52,557
I was just about getting fed up

195
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:55,657
with that lady's secretiveness too.

196
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:58,058
I didn't get the go-sign, but who cares.

197
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:03,458
If she acts up,

198
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,457
I'll show no mercy.

199
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,358
Even if she's that person's favourite...

200
00:14:23,658 --> 00:14:24,858
Strange.

201
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:29,858
It's strange after all.

202
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,857
Compared to when I came here to check the mailbox,

203
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:36,357
the water meter as well as the gas meter has moved,

204
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:38,358
although it's really slight.

205
00:14:44,558 --> 00:14:46,457
Who is inside

206
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,558
this house?

207
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:57,858
I guess this is the best place to watch me and Haibara.

208
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:06,657
I know I can handle two men,

209
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:09,058
but what if there are more than three?

210
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:16,057
Cool head.

211
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:18,657
Judging from the meter,

212
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:20,858
the most that would be in here is one or two of them.

213
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:38,358
Besides...

214
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:13,525
What a full moon.

215
00:16:13,526 --> 00:16:17,625
Really, it's so appropriate for "A Blood-smeared Party on Board"!

216
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:18,626
All right.

217
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:21,825
I'm getting excited!

218
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:23,525
I'm feeling a positive turbulent rush of blood.

219
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:25,125
Hey, Pops.

220
00:16:25,126 --> 00:16:26,625
Isn't the werewolf the one who feels a positive

221
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:28,125
turbulent rush of blood when the full moon is out?

222
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:30,925
You're Dracula, you know, Pops.

223
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:32,225
Shut up.

224
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:35,725
I mean I'm getting a positive turbulent rush of blood as a detective!

225
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:37,825
Excuse me?

226
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:39,925
Are you two also going to be attending

227
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:43,725
the Off-season Halloween Party too?

228
00:16:43,726 --> 00:16:45,425
Right.

229
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:46,825
I thought it was ridiculous

230
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:49,325
because it's a costume party, but...

231
00:16:49,326 --> 00:16:52,025
Well, the thing is...

232
00:16:52,026 --> 00:16:54,226
I'm going there too!

233
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:18,225
I wonder if it's going to be okay

234
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:21,226
leaving Ai like that by herself.

235
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,025
Yeah.

236
00:17:26,026 --> 00:17:28,325
I left the room warm.

237
00:17:28,326 --> 00:17:30,225
I also left food and water behind with her too,

238
00:17:30,226 --> 00:17:31,626
so I don't think there'll be any problems.

239
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:36,325
I can't wait to play

240
00:17:36,326 --> 00:17:39,025
that new game you were saying you created.

241
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:40,926
Do you want to try it?

242
00:17:58,126 --> 00:18:00,525
The position of the things in the drawer

243
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:02,226
is also slightly out of place.

244
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:12,525
You looked for it

245
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:14,625
all by yourself

246
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,826
in order to confront them.

247
00:18:23,526 --> 00:18:25,025
Look at them!

248
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:27,525
Werewolf.

249
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:29,725
Frankenstein.

250
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:31,426
Mummy.

251
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:35,825
Even Jiangshi is here!

252
00:18:35,826 --> 00:18:38,125
It's full of monsters!

253
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:40,325
Really! How exciting!

254
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:41,825
Are you sure it's okay

255
00:18:41,826 --> 00:18:43,825
for the daughter of the Suzuki Financial Group

256
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:46,325
to be mixed up among guys like this?

257
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,025
It's fine...

258
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,325
Unlike Ran, I kind of like stuff like this!

259
00:18:51,326 --> 00:18:53,025
By the way, Sonoko?

260
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:55,625
Just what are you disguised as?

261
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:56,925
How rude!

262
00:18:56,926 --> 00:18:58,825
I'm a witch!

263
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:01,126
Don't you see that I've got a broom?

264
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:12,825
What's with him?

265
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:14,725
Hey, Pops?

266
00:19:14,726 --> 00:19:16,225
Maybe he's saying move over

267
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:18,226
because the front seats are open?

268
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:20,825
Darn it.

269
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,125
Then why don't you say so in a way I understand.

270
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:26,325
He's just really trying to be the character

271
00:19:26,326 --> 00:19:29,825
that he's disguised as.

272
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:33,025
My... What a beautiful witch you are.

273
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:34,825
Thank you.

274
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:38,125
But, I'm...

275
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:39,925
not a witch.

276
00:19:39,926 --> 00:19:42,125
Medusa?

277
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:45,425
I'll turn you into stone.

278
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:49,125
Will the next person show us your invitation card!

279
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:52,525
Sure...

280
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:57,325
You're the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

281
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:58,625
So, you saw through my disguise?

282
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:00,425
Oh, no.

283
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:04,325
Your name's written on the invitation card, see?

284
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:06,325
Then, please fill in your name.

285
00:20:06,326 --> 00:20:07,525
Yeah.

286
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:12,425
Kogoro. Mouri.

287
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:14,125
By the way...

288
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:19,325
I hope you're not planning to really commit a murder here, are you?

289
00:20:19,326 --> 00:20:22,925
Well, together with this invitation card,

290
00:20:22,926 --> 00:20:27,225
there was a letter hinting that a crime may be committed here!

291
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,125
It's true that this invitation card is what we made,

292
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:34,325
but I know nothing of this letter or the envelope.

293
00:20:34,326 --> 00:20:36,025
Really?

294
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,125
There will be a "guess who the criminal is" game

295
00:20:39,126 --> 00:20:40,425
played during the party though.

296
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:41,825
Could it be

297
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:44,825
the producer decided to do a little extra

298
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,225
to make sure he'll come here.

299
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:48,025
Producer?

300
00:20:48,026 --> 00:20:50,925
Oh, no, it's nothing.

301
00:20:50,926 --> 00:20:53,725
But, we're sure that you'll enjoy the cursed banquet.

302
00:20:53,726 --> 00:20:55,025
Come on, Pops!

303
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:57,225
Let's hurry and go!

304
00:20:57,226 --> 00:20:59,226
Oh, Hey, you!

305
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:03,626
Next guest please!

306
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:08,426
Your invitation card, please.

307
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:21,725
Aren't you by chance

308
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:23,525
the high school detective?

309
00:21:23,526 --> 00:21:27,026
"Shinichi Kudo."

310
00:23:58,226 --> 00:24:00,125
Thank you.

311
00:24:00,126 --> 00:24:03,325
But, they sure got a lot of them gathered here.

312
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:04,525
You can say that again.

313
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,626
What?

314
00:24:11,226 --> 00:24:13,025
It's finally going to start.

315
00:24:13,026 --> 00:24:14,126
Yeah.

316
00:24:16,926 --> 00:24:18,925
You devilish diabolic monsters

317
00:24:18,926 --> 00:24:22,025
who wander through the nether world,

318
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:26,825
welcome to our haunted ship named Phantom.

319
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:32,525
I am Captain Gold and I will be navigating this phantom ship.

320
00:24:32,526 --> 00:24:35,325
There's only an hour more to go before the party.

321
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:39,425
Please pick your comrades who will be sharing fate with you.

322
00:24:39,426 --> 00:24:44,725
Seven comrades who have received the same seal as yourself.

323
00:24:44,726 --> 00:24:46,225
The same seal?

324
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:47,725
The tarot card!

325
00:24:47,726 --> 00:24:50,425
You got one when you came on board too, didn't you?

326
00:24:50,426 --> 00:24:53,725
I think we're going to team up with people who got the same card

327
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:56,226
and play a game or something.

328
00:24:58,326 --> 00:25:01,125
You mean this XV that's written here,

329
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,425
the card of the goat.

330
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:06,625
Which means we're on the goat team?

331
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:08,425
That's not a goat.

332
00:25:08,426 --> 00:25:11,925
In Roman Numerals XV is the figure 15.

333
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:14,525
The name of the card is The Devil.

334
00:25:14,526 --> 00:25:16,325
The card of the devil.

335
00:25:16,326 --> 00:25:18,225
Oh, is that right?

336
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,425
Besides, we weren't divided in groups

337
00:25:20,426 --> 00:25:23,425
just to play a game.

338
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:27,325
This party is also an audition for a role in a movie too.

339
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,925
An audition?

340
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:30,325
You know, don't you?

341
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:31,725
The movie that's played every summer called.

342
00:25:31,726 --> 00:25:35,025
"The Diary of Captain Ghost's Voyage".

343
00:25:35,026 --> 00:25:36,425
Yeah.

344
00:25:36,426 --> 00:25:38,825
The one about a load of monsters riding a phantom ship

345
00:25:38,826 --> 00:25:42,525
and coming to get people who performed evil deeds.

346
00:25:42,526 --> 00:25:43,725
Which means if things work out,

347
00:25:43,726 --> 00:25:45,925
I may appear in the movie too?

348
00:25:45,926 --> 00:25:47,225
Yes.

349
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:50,725
This seems to be the fourth time this party's been held,

350
00:25:50,726 --> 00:25:51,925
and each year the movie staff

351
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,025
seem to be mixed among everyone here

352
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:56,326
to judge carefully for the cast.

353
00:25:58,026 --> 00:25:59,725
I see.

354
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:02,625
Everyone wants to play the part of popular monster roles,

355
00:26:02,626 --> 00:26:05,925
so they divide people into teams to make choosing easier.

356
00:26:05,926 --> 00:26:07,225
That's why everyone's

357
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:10,025
trying to put out their best, right?

358
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:13,425
The Werewolf who roars towards the moon.

359
00:26:13,426 --> 00:26:15,525
The Frankenstein that moves like a robot

360
00:26:15,526 --> 00:26:17,825
and does pantomime.

361
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:22,625
The Mummy who keeps his silence no matter who talks to him.

362
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:24,925
Well, although they're going to appear in the movie,

363
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:27,025
they're no more than supporting actors

364
00:26:27,026 --> 00:26:28,925
who will appear behind the main stars.

365
00:26:28,926 --> 00:26:31,325
Since it'll cost an enormous amount of money

366
00:26:31,326 --> 00:26:33,625
if the film company has to cover makeup fees

367
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:35,025
and everything for all the supporting actors,

368
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:38,025
so they let horror fans appear in their best outfits

369
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:40,925
and put on their best act.

370
00:26:40,926 --> 00:26:45,825
Besides, holding an event on the this ship that was used in the movie

371
00:26:45,826 --> 00:26:48,026
will serve as an advertisement for the movie too.

372
00:26:56,926 --> 00:26:58,525
All right, all of you!

373
00:26:58,526 --> 00:27:00,625
The time to set sail has come!

374
00:27:00,626 --> 00:27:02,725
We shall cross the seven cursed seas

375
00:27:02,726 --> 00:27:05,425
and show the conceited humans our power

376
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:09,926
as well as teach them a lesson!

377
00:27:15,126 --> 00:27:17,225
Don't tell me this ship is...

378
00:27:17,226 --> 00:27:18,526
really going to move?

379
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,925
Is there anyone who has the card of Death?

380
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:28,325
Hermit!

381
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:31,126
Anybody around who has the card of the Hermit?

382
00:27:37,826 --> 00:27:40,425
What? Shinichi Kudo?

383
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:43,125
You mean that high school detective is on this ship?

384
00:27:43,126 --> 00:27:44,625
Right...

385
00:27:44,626 --> 00:27:47,625
But I heard that he was involved in some kind of incident

386
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:49,425
and was killed.

387
00:27:49,426 --> 00:27:52,725
No way! That's nothing but lies!

388
00:27:52,726 --> 00:27:55,525
And? What kind of disguise was he in?

389
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:57,025
He was bandaged up,

390
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:58,325
so maybe a mummy?

391
00:27:58,326 --> 00:27:59,425
A mummy detective.

392
00:27:59,426 --> 00:28:01,426
That would be so handsome!

393
00:28:06,426 --> 00:28:07,825
Okay!

394
00:28:07,826 --> 00:28:11,625
All seven of us are here!

395
00:28:11,626 --> 00:28:13,425
They're the people we saw just a while ago.

396
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:15,725
Now our names...

397
00:28:15,726 --> 00:28:17,325
This is Medusa.

398
00:28:17,326 --> 00:28:21,325
Werewolf, Frankenstein and Mummy.

399
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:26,826
And can we call you Mummy 2?

400
00:28:30,326 --> 00:28:32,626
What? Do you want to shake hands?

401
00:28:39,726 --> 00:28:41,325
I see.

402
00:28:41,326 --> 00:28:43,725
You're Invisible Man.

403
00:28:43,726 --> 00:28:45,225
So...

404
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:49,425
I wonder what the seven of us are going to do?

405
00:28:49,426 --> 00:28:52,626
They did say that this was a catch the culprit sort of game.

406
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:03,525
How do you like the game I made this time?

407
00:29:03,526 --> 00:29:04,925
It's pretty cool, don't you think?

408
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:07,125
Yeah. It's a masterpiece!

409
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:08,825
Right!

410
00:29:08,826 --> 00:29:11,725
-I'm sure this'll satisfy them. -Yes, Agasa residence.

411
00:29:11,726 --> 00:29:13,125
-I'll call them first thing tomorrow. -I'm sorry for calling this late.

412
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,425
This is Dr. Araide.

413
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:16,025
-Is Dr. Agasa there? -I'll have them monitor it!

414
00:29:16,026 --> 00:29:17,525
He's not in.

415
00:29:17,526 --> 00:29:20,525
I think he went out somewhere with Edogawa.

416
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:23,725
What? But I hear their voices.

417
00:29:23,726 --> 00:29:25,325
This?

418
00:29:25,326 --> 00:29:26,725
It's their recorded voices.

419
00:29:26,726 --> 00:29:28,926
I don't know what prank they're up to.

420
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:34,325
But it's been playing for some time now.

421
00:29:34,326 --> 00:29:36,325
So, what's up?

422
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:38,125
Oh, yeah.

423
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:40,925
Actually, I wanted to talk to you.

424
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:45,225
Well, your cold's taking a while to get better, right?

425
00:29:45,226 --> 00:29:49,925
So I figured you should be checked at a hospital with good facilities,

426
00:29:49,926 --> 00:29:52,425
and asked a friend doctor of mine,

427
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:54,125
but was told that he has to go on a business trip,

428
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,725
so he's only available tonight.

429
00:29:56,726 --> 00:29:58,125
That is why...

430
00:29:58,126 --> 00:30:00,025
I know this is really sudden

431
00:30:00,026 --> 00:30:02,425
but can I go pick you up now?

432
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:06,725
I'll notify Dr. Agasa later for you.

433
00:30:06,726 --> 00:30:09,626
Well, I don't want to force you though.

434
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,325
It doesn't bother me.

435
00:30:12,326 --> 00:30:15,425
I was kind of angry anyway because they're doing their own thing.

436
00:30:15,426 --> 00:30:18,226
Besides, it's boring staying home alone.

437
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:20,925
Great.

438
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:23,025
Then, okay.

439
00:30:23,026 --> 00:30:25,425
I'll be there in about an hour

440
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:28,725
so will you get ready to leave as soon as I get there?

441
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:29,825
Okay.

442
00:30:29,826 --> 00:30:31,426
I'll see you in an hour then.

443
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:37,825
All right! All seven of us have finally gathered!

444
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:40,425
What dense guys.

445
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:42,225
Pops?

446
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:48,125
Werewolf, Frankenstein and Mummy are nowhere in sight.

447
00:32:48,126 --> 00:32:49,325
What?

448
00:32:49,326 --> 00:32:50,825
I wonder if they went to the toilet.

449
00:32:50,826 --> 00:32:52,625
I guess so?

450
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:56,025
If that is the case, let's go see.

451
00:32:56,026 --> 00:32:59,325
The party is about to begin too.

452
00:32:59,326 --> 00:33:01,426
Yeah.

453
00:33:02,726 --> 00:33:06,025
It's over here.

454
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,725
Oh, there he is!

455
00:33:07,726 --> 00:33:09,925
I tell you, Frankenstein!

456
00:33:09,926 --> 00:33:13,425
We looked all over for you!

457
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:16,925
What a toilet this is, though.

458
00:33:16,926 --> 00:33:19,125
It's dimly lit and full of spider webs,

459
00:33:19,126 --> 00:33:21,025
even the mirror is cracked.

460
00:33:21,026 --> 00:33:23,625
Not only that, men and women have to use the toilet together!

461
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:26,225
After all, we're all monsters,

462
00:33:26,226 --> 00:33:29,625
so I guess there's no need to differentiate between men and women.

463
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:31,625
It won't come off.

464
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:35,225
The blood on my hands won't come off.

465
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:38,925
It won't come off even if I wash my hands.

466
00:33:38,926 --> 00:33:42,825
Hey, acting your part even in the toilet too?

467
00:33:42,826 --> 00:33:44,325
Excuse me.

468
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:48,426
Are Werewolf and Mummy here?

469
00:33:51,526 --> 00:33:53,025
They don't seem to be here.

470
00:33:53,026 --> 00:33:54,126
Yeah.

471
00:34:07,726 --> 00:34:09,626
What was that?

472
00:34:23,326 --> 00:34:26,025
Hey, boss! What's up?

473
00:34:26,026 --> 00:34:27,225
Bartender.

474
00:34:27,226 --> 00:34:30,025
Can you give me the same thing he's drinking?

475
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,325
Silver Bullet?

476
00:34:32,326 --> 00:34:35,225
White Lady for me then, please.

477
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:36,825
Yes, ma'am.

478
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:39,625
Hey, you don't look too hot.

479
00:34:39,626 --> 00:34:42,126
Are you bummed out or something?

480
00:34:43,026 --> 00:34:44,326
Hey.

481
00:34:49,326 --> 00:34:50,425
What is it?

482
00:34:50,426 --> 00:34:52,626
Is he looking for somebody?

483
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:59,825
I wonder where Mummy disappeared to?

484
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:02,525
How should I know? Geez...

485
00:35:02,526 --> 00:35:05,825
Of all things! Talk about not being able to work in groups.

486
00:35:05,826 --> 00:35:08,426
An hour has already gone by.

487
00:35:09,826 --> 00:35:11,026
-What? -What's...

488
00:35:12,326 --> 00:35:14,126
The party has started.

489
00:35:17,626 --> 00:35:20,725
Listen, you monsters.

490
00:35:20,726 --> 00:35:24,125
I've got good news for all of you.

491
00:35:24,126 --> 00:35:27,025
The bait's been set.

492
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:29,725
It seems that there is a human

493
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:32,125
among us at this party

494
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:35,525
that is neither ugly nor possesses evil power.

495
00:35:35,526 --> 00:35:38,025
Go now and join hands with the seven comrades

496
00:35:38,026 --> 00:35:40,425
that you will share your fate with.

497
00:35:40,426 --> 00:35:43,625
Find the good-for-nothing, tear its meat apart,

498
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:45,425
pull out its guts

499
00:35:45,426 --> 00:35:48,525
and drink up to the last drop the blood

500
00:35:48,526 --> 00:35:50,926
that comes flowing out!

501
00:35:52,926 --> 00:35:54,125
Okay!

502
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:56,125
If it's looking for the culprit, there's none other than I,

503
00:35:56,126 --> 00:35:58,425
Kogoro Mouri, more suited for the job!

504
00:35:58,426 --> 00:36:01,725
But, not all seven of us are here yet.

505
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,325
Who cares!

506
00:36:03,326 --> 00:36:05,325
If I figure out who the culprit is,

507
00:36:05,326 --> 00:36:07,925
I'm sure they'll come walking out from their side!

508
00:36:07,926 --> 00:36:13,325
I have the keyword which is the hint to who it is.

509
00:36:13,326 --> 00:36:15,525
If you want to get hold of the treasure

510
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:17,125
that is to be your reward,

511
00:36:17,126 --> 00:36:19,226
come out to deck and receive my revelation...

512
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,526
What's that?

513
00:36:39,126 --> 00:36:40,725
What's the matter?

514
00:36:40,726 --> 00:36:45,525
I'm sorry, the load that was on the construction truck fell off.

515
00:36:45,526 --> 00:36:47,525
We'll clear it up right away,

516
00:36:47,526 --> 00:36:49,725
so please give us a moment.

517
00:36:49,726 --> 00:36:51,425
I'm in a bit of a rush,

518
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:52,725
so I'm going to go around.

519
00:36:52,726 --> 00:36:54,226
I'm sorry.

520
00:37:02,526 --> 00:37:04,126
I'm sorry.

521
00:37:10,226 --> 00:37:12,125
Thank you for waiting.

522
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:13,825
You may go through now.

523
00:37:13,826 --> 00:37:15,926
Thank you. Goodbye.

524
00:37:19,426 --> 00:37:21,226
Take care!

525
00:37:27,326 --> 00:37:29,226
He just went through.

526
00:37:30,326 --> 00:37:33,425
What's that?

527
00:37:33,426 --> 00:37:34,926
That's...

528
00:37:37,626 --> 00:37:40,326
Captain of the phantom ship?

529
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,826
What a grand performance.

530
00:37:50,926 --> 00:37:53,225
This is real blood.

531
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:54,226
What?

532
00:37:54,227 --> 00:37:55,325
Hurry!

533
00:37:55,326 --> 00:37:57,426
Hurry, somebody get him down!

534
00:38:17,826 --> 00:38:19,226
Yes...

535
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:32,526
Hi.

536
00:41:08,126 --> 00:41:09,626
Hi.

537
00:41:15,026 --> 00:41:19,525
Oh, I'm sorry to have surprised you.

538
00:41:19,526 --> 00:41:22,325
I'm an English teacher of Teitan High School,

539
00:41:22,326 --> 00:41:25,225
where Dr. Araide is in charge of.

540
00:41:25,226 --> 00:41:29,525
His car broke down on his way here.

541
00:41:29,526 --> 00:41:33,426
That's why I've come to pick you up instead!

542
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:39,626
If it's okay with you, will you please unchain the door?

543
00:41:47,626 --> 00:41:49,926
I'm really late.

544
00:41:58,126 --> 00:42:00,126
Jodie.

545
00:42:22,326 --> 00:42:26,025
His chest is pierced through with an arrow of a bow gun.

546
00:42:26,026 --> 00:42:27,225
Moreover,

547
00:42:27,226 --> 00:42:30,325
the card of the devil is here too.

548
00:42:30,326 --> 00:42:35,525
So, the devil's the guide to the world beyond?

549
00:42:35,526 --> 00:42:37,325
I don't think he needed any guide to take him

550
00:42:37,326 --> 00:42:40,325
to the world beyond though,

551
00:42:40,326 --> 00:42:42,625
because he seemed to have died on the spot.

552
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,125
True.

553
00:42:44,126 --> 00:42:46,625
And as for the bow gun that fired the arrow,

554
00:42:46,626 --> 00:42:50,225
it's probably been disposed of somewhere in this vast Pacific Ocean

555
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:52,825
so virtually will not be found.

556
00:42:52,826 --> 00:42:56,725
So, I wonder if there's a camera on this ship?

557
00:42:56,726 --> 00:42:59,925
I'd like to take a picture of the scene.

558
00:42:59,926 --> 00:43:01,425
We have a digital camera

559
00:43:01,426 --> 00:43:03,525
that we are using to take pictures of this party.

560
00:43:03,526 --> 00:43:06,025
Well, it's something that will serve as evidence

561
00:43:06,026 --> 00:43:08,025
so I'd prefer something on film, but...

562
00:43:08,026 --> 00:43:09,125
Pops,

563
00:43:09,126 --> 00:43:12,225
I've got a disposable camera on me.

564
00:43:12,226 --> 00:43:13,925
See.

565
00:43:13,926 --> 00:43:16,426
Well, I guess it's better than nothing.

566
00:43:24,026 --> 00:43:27,826
I'll take a look at his face then.

567
00:43:30,326 --> 00:43:33,325
I think I've seen him somewhere before.

568
00:43:33,326 --> 00:43:37,925
Isn't he a movie producer that appears a lot on TV?

569
00:43:37,926 --> 00:43:41,725
I think his name was Senzo Fukuura.

570
00:43:41,726 --> 00:43:44,125
I think he became famous

571
00:43:44,126 --> 00:43:47,425
after producing the Unlucky Days series,

572
00:43:47,426 --> 00:43:49,625
before the Phantom Ship Captain series.

573
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:53,725
Are you saying that the producer appeared in the movie in person

574
00:43:53,726 --> 00:43:55,325
and acted the role of the captain of Phantom Ship?

575
00:43:55,326 --> 00:44:00,025
No, the movie was filmed using a real actor.

576
00:44:00,026 --> 00:44:03,425
Mr. Fukuura loved the captain of the Phantom Ship,

577
00:44:03,426 --> 00:44:05,925
so he used to play the role of his own initiative every year

578
00:44:05,926 --> 00:44:07,725
at the party on board.

579
00:44:07,726 --> 00:44:10,625
Mr. Fukuura is the one who planned the performance of

580
00:44:10,626 --> 00:44:13,225
appearing on the mast with the light shining on him

581
00:44:13,226 --> 00:44:14,425
and giving out hints to the quiz.

582
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:15,725
Yeah.

583
00:44:15,726 --> 00:44:20,825
You mean that quiz about humans being mixed up here among the monsters.

584
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:24,626
There's a microphone attached to the inside of the mask.

585
00:44:27,226 --> 00:44:31,126
It seems he was talking directly into this microphone.

586
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:33,825
And?

587
00:44:33,826 --> 00:44:36,225
What's the answer to this quiz?

588
00:44:36,226 --> 00:44:38,825
Well, the quizzes and hints

589
00:44:38,826 --> 00:44:41,625
were decide on by Mr. Fukuura alone,

590
00:44:41,626 --> 00:44:43,825
so we, the staff know nothing about them.

591
00:44:43,826 --> 00:44:47,125
We heard that the first group to solve the quiz

592
00:44:47,126 --> 00:44:51,825
would receive an invitation to the preview of the movie, though.

593
00:44:51,826 --> 00:44:53,425
Well,

594
00:44:53,426 --> 00:44:58,426
it seems quite definite that one of you among the staff is the killer.

595
00:44:59,926 --> 00:45:01,325
First of all,

596
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:04,025
Mr. Fukuura who was disguised as the captain of the phantom ship

597
00:45:04,026 --> 00:45:07,325
started suffering while he was announcing the quiz.

598
00:45:07,326 --> 00:45:11,825
He was probably struck by the bow gun then.

599
00:45:11,826 --> 00:45:13,525
However, back then,

600
00:45:13,526 --> 00:45:15,225
we, the passengers,

601
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:18,525
were still inside the ship at the party hall.

602
00:45:18,526 --> 00:45:20,625
It would've been impossible for us

603
00:45:20,626 --> 00:45:22,225
to fire the bow gun at Mr. Fukuura

604
00:45:22,226 --> 00:45:23,825
who was on the top of the mast.

605
00:45:23,826 --> 00:45:25,625
So high chances the person who killed him

606
00:45:25,626 --> 00:45:27,525
is the one who prepared the lighting

607
00:45:27,526 --> 00:45:31,125
and audio devices when he announce the quiz,

608
00:45:31,126 --> 00:45:33,625
which is one of the staff.

609
00:45:33,626 --> 00:45:37,125
Secondly, this card of the devil.

610
00:45:37,126 --> 00:45:39,125
The killer probably wanted to mislead people into thinking

611
00:45:39,126 --> 00:45:41,825
that one of the passengers who boarded this ship

612
00:45:41,826 --> 00:45:44,125
that received this card is the killer.

613
00:45:44,126 --> 00:45:46,925
Since you're the ones who prepared the cards,

614
00:45:46,926 --> 00:45:49,225
you probably could make as many of these cards as you wanted to.

615
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:50,325
No.

616
00:45:50,326 --> 00:45:54,725
These cards were made by Mr. Fukuura to avoid foul play.

617
00:45:54,726 --> 00:45:56,825
So, it would have been impossible for any of the staff

618
00:45:56,826 --> 00:45:58,225
to prepare these cards.

619
00:45:58,226 --> 00:46:00,725
Last year he used playing cards.

620
00:46:00,726 --> 00:46:04,525
Besides there was a passenger who was on deck

621
00:46:04,526 --> 00:46:06,525
before the quiz was announced too.

622
00:46:06,526 --> 00:46:08,726
Saying that he wanted to look at the ocean.

623
00:46:09,926 --> 00:46:11,925
I don't remember who exactly that person was

624
00:46:11,926 --> 00:46:14,125
since it was dark though.

625
00:46:14,126 --> 00:46:16,325
Oh, is that right?

626
00:46:16,326 --> 00:46:18,525
I see.

627
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:22,025
Which means the possibility of the killer being among us

628
00:46:22,026 --> 00:46:26,226
who has received the card of the devil is high!

629
00:46:40,726 --> 00:46:42,325
Are you okay?

630
00:46:42,326 --> 00:46:47,025
The doctor that we're going to see is very efficient!

631
00:46:47,026 --> 00:46:49,825
So, your cold will be cured right away

632
00:46:49,826 --> 00:46:52,226
and you'll feel better in no time at all.

633
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:11,225
By the way,

634
00:47:11,226 --> 00:47:14,325
when is this ship returning to the harbor?

635
00:47:14,326 --> 00:47:17,225
I think it'll be another hour or so.

636
00:47:17,226 --> 00:47:18,425
I see.

637
00:47:18,426 --> 00:47:20,725
Then, shall we go inside the ship

638
00:47:20,726 --> 00:47:22,925
and investigate the case?

639
00:47:22,926 --> 00:47:24,925
Mr. Sleeping Vampire?

640
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,426
Oh, okay.

641
00:47:33,626 --> 00:47:35,725
What's up, Pops?

642
00:47:35,726 --> 00:47:38,025
It seems we're going to be late

643
00:47:38,026 --> 00:47:39,826
so I thought I'd let Ran know.

644
00:47:58,926 --> 00:48:00,325
She's not answering.

645
00:48:00,326 --> 00:48:02,625
Maybe she's taking a bath?

646
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:06,426
"Mouri Detective Agency."

647
00:50:37,126 --> 00:50:38,825
Okay, then.

648
00:50:38,826 --> 00:50:43,426
Please show me the card of the devil that you all have.

649
00:50:46,326 --> 00:50:49,225
What?

650
00:50:49,226 --> 00:50:51,425
What's the matter, Mummy?

651
00:50:51,426 --> 00:50:54,026
I wonder if I dropped it somewhere?

652
00:50:56,226 --> 00:50:59,725
You deliberately poked your card with the arrow

653
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:02,725
and tried to free yourself from being a suspect, right?

654
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,625
You played on the psychology that

655
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:07,625
nobody would think that the killer himself

656
00:51:07,626 --> 00:51:10,325
would leave his devil card behind with the victim,

657
00:51:10,326 --> 00:51:12,725
unaware that this card

658
00:51:12,726 --> 00:51:14,525
was a one of a kind in this world,

659
00:51:14,526 --> 00:51:17,725
that Mr. Fukuura had exclusively made!

660
00:51:17,726 --> 00:51:21,025
I was fully aware of that too!

661
00:51:21,026 --> 00:51:23,425
How'd you know?

662
00:51:23,426 --> 00:51:24,825
Because...

663
00:51:24,826 --> 00:51:26,925
I was asked by Mr. Fukuura

664
00:51:26,926 --> 00:51:29,925
to sit among the passengers

665
00:51:29,926 --> 00:51:32,325
and choose someone with great makeup on.

666
00:51:32,326 --> 00:51:34,325
After all, I'm also a staff member of the movie!

667
00:51:34,326 --> 00:51:35,326
What?

668
00:51:35,327 --> 00:51:37,926
You're a movie staff member?

669
00:51:39,726 --> 00:51:44,225
So I would never dream of hurting Mr. Fukuura.

670
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,525
Are you the only movie staff

671
00:51:46,526 --> 00:51:48,125
that is mixed up among the passengers here?

672
00:51:48,126 --> 00:51:49,525
No.

673
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:52,225
Almost all the other mummies besides me are staff members.

674
00:51:52,226 --> 00:51:55,325
When we find passengers with great makeup,

675
00:51:55,326 --> 00:51:58,325
we contacted Mr. Fukuura by e-mail.

676
00:51:58,326 --> 00:52:01,425
Mr. Fukuura was also the one that gave us this outfit, right?

677
00:52:01,426 --> 00:52:02,725
Yeah.

678
00:52:02,726 --> 00:52:04,925
We received all kinds of instructions from Mr. Fukuura

679
00:52:04,926 --> 00:52:06,425
while he was helping us with the makeup.

680
00:52:06,426 --> 00:52:09,425
Instructions? What kind of instructions?

681
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:12,325
Like, drink a certain kind of wine, et cetera.

682
00:52:12,326 --> 00:52:15,925
I was told to eat only chicken dishes.

683
00:52:15,926 --> 00:52:19,825
I was told to wear this red wig.

684
00:52:19,826 --> 00:52:22,825
All his instructions were varied depending on the person

685
00:52:22,826 --> 00:52:26,925
and the only common instruction he gave us was not to talk.

686
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:28,725
What kind of instruction is that supposed to be?

687
00:52:28,726 --> 00:52:30,225
How should I know?

688
00:52:30,226 --> 00:52:32,626
It's Mr. Fukuura's instructions!

689
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:47,025
But...

690
00:53:47,026 --> 00:53:49,725
when we were waiting for the quiz,

691
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:53,625
you disappeared from before us, didn't you?

692
00:53:53,626 --> 00:53:56,625
I went to the toilet!

693
00:53:56,626 --> 00:53:58,925
These two were with me too!

694
00:53:58,926 --> 00:54:00,225
Right?

695
00:54:00,226 --> 00:54:01,725
It's true.

696
00:54:01,726 --> 00:54:04,725
That you were with us when we went to the toilet.

697
00:54:04,726 --> 00:54:06,225
See!

698
00:54:06,226 --> 00:54:07,725
But...

699
00:54:07,726 --> 00:54:10,225
I didn't see you come out of the toilet.

700
00:54:10,226 --> 00:54:12,925
What? What are you talking about?

701
00:54:12,926 --> 00:54:15,725
I passed right behind you when I left!

702
00:54:15,726 --> 00:54:18,625
Why're you saying something like that?

703
00:54:18,626 --> 00:54:21,725
I guess you didn't notice me

704
00:54:21,726 --> 00:54:24,725
because somebody cracked the mirror.

705
00:54:24,726 --> 00:54:26,725
What? You mean that mirror

706
00:54:26,726 --> 00:54:30,125
wasn't cracked to begin with in order to give a creepy atmosphere?

707
00:54:30,126 --> 00:54:31,725
Yes.

708
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:36,025
It wasn't cracked until we departed!

709
00:54:36,026 --> 00:54:37,925
Are you sure?

710
00:54:37,926 --> 00:54:40,025
Yes!

711
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:44,425
We, the staff, decorated this ship together.

712
00:54:44,426 --> 00:54:46,625
But we weren't given instructions

713
00:54:46,626 --> 00:54:47,825
to crack the mirror in the toilet.

714
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:51,325
Then, just before Mr. Fukuura was about to give out the quiz,

715
00:54:51,326 --> 00:54:53,625
where were you?

716
00:54:53,626 --> 00:54:55,325
I was here!

717
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:58,225
Near Werewolf! Right?

718
00:54:58,226 --> 00:55:01,425
You saw me, didn't you?

719
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:03,325
I wonder. I don't remember.

720
00:55:03,326 --> 00:55:05,025
Oh, no.

721
00:55:05,026 --> 00:55:08,225
I was desperate trying to sell myself

722
00:55:08,226 --> 00:55:11,725
because I wanted a part in the movie!

723
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:13,126
Like this!

724
00:55:16,426 --> 00:55:17,925
Come to think of it,

725
00:55:17,926 --> 00:55:20,026
you were roaring several times.

726
00:56:25,726 --> 00:56:30,725
It seems that nobody's seen you around.

727
00:56:30,726 --> 00:56:34,625
Which means you don't have an established alibi.

728
00:56:34,626 --> 00:56:35,925
Oh, no.

729
00:56:35,926 --> 00:56:38,325
It... It's a trap!

730
00:56:38,326 --> 00:56:42,425
Somebody's conspired to frame me!

731
00:56:42,426 --> 00:56:47,025
A killer who's cornered barks a lot.

732
00:56:47,026 --> 00:56:52,225
Moreover, you don't have an alibi and the devil card.

733
00:56:52,226 --> 00:56:55,325
Mummy, you're the only one...

734
00:56:55,326 --> 00:56:59,025
You're the only one that could've committed the murder!

735
00:56:59,026 --> 00:57:02,525
Detective Mouri, you're a little off there.

736
00:57:02,526 --> 00:57:05,225
What?

737
00:57:05,226 --> 00:57:08,925
The truth is still in the dark.

738
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:12,225
The voice is coming from the speaker the phantom ship captain was using!

739
00:57:12,226 --> 00:57:13,525
Darn it!

740
00:57:13,526 --> 00:57:15,825
The deck!

741
00:57:15,826 --> 00:57:17,526
Out of my way!

742
00:57:30,926 --> 00:57:32,925
Who is it?

743
00:57:32,926 --> 00:57:34,626
Where are you?

744
00:57:35,726 --> 00:57:38,625
You've already acquired everything you need

745
00:57:38,626 --> 00:57:41,425
to solve the case and yet...

746
00:57:41,426 --> 00:57:42,725
How disappointing.

747
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:44,825
Why you!

748
00:57:44,826 --> 00:57:45,925
Who are you?

749
00:57:45,926 --> 00:57:49,226
You better shut up or you're going to pay for this!

750
00:57:51,226 --> 00:57:52,925
Have you forgotten me already?

751
00:57:52,926 --> 00:57:56,126
It's me, Detective Mouri.

752
00:58:00,526 --> 00:58:02,826
Invisible man!

753
00:58:06,826 --> 00:58:09,625
Captain of this phantom ship, Captain Gold, that is,

754
00:58:09,626 --> 00:58:11,725
the host of this party

755
00:58:11,726 --> 00:58:13,925
and movie producer, Mr. Senzo Fukuura,

756
00:58:13,926 --> 00:58:16,625
was killed by who?

757
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,525
And...

758
00:58:18,526 --> 00:58:21,126
how was he killed?

759
00:58:22,726 --> 00:58:23,826
Shall we...

760
00:58:24,926 --> 00:58:27,426
begin solving the case then?

761
00:58:29,026 --> 00:58:31,425
That voice.

762
00:58:31,426 --> 00:58:33,525
That tone of voice.

763
00:58:33,526 --> 00:58:36,425
It can't be...

764
00:58:36,426 --> 00:58:38,426
Under the moonlight...

765
00:58:42,326 --> 00:58:44,426
that shines light upon the dark night.
