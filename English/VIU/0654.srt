1
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:03,983
Soon after the killing of Design Company President

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:07,683
Kohei Wakamatsu in his villa in Karuizawa,

3
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:11,183
his son Ikuro was poisoned to death in his house in Tokyo.

4
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:13,383
For some strange reason,

5
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:15,983
the pieces other than those that Ikuro ate

6
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:18,983
didn't have poison on them.

7
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:23,283
How on earth did the culprit poison Ikuro to death?

8
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:28,083
Inspector Kansuke Yamato of the Nagano Prefectural Police realized that

9
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,283
the bath room that President Wakamatsu was killed in

10
00:00:30,283 --> 00:00:33,083
was made with tiles that cause an illusion

11
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:36,083
called "Crazy Diamond".

12
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,983
Although President Wakamatsu's dying message

13
00:00:38,983 --> 00:00:41,883
that had vanished was revived...

14
00:00:41,883 --> 00:00:47,183
Three letters of the alphabet were written, "S-O-N"!

15
00:00:47,183 --> 00:00:48,783
Son.

16
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:50,083
His son?

17
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:10,683
If all cases were men,

18
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:12,683
all hidden mysteries are women.

19
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:15,883
Crazy Diamond is newly discovered. The mystery of poison.

20
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:17,583
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,483
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:21,883
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:47,114 --> 00:02:52,692
"Design of Poison and Illusion (Poison)"

24
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:55,515
Hey! Are you serious?

25
00:02:55,515 --> 00:02:57,815
You mean the one who was killed in Tokyo tonight

26
00:02:57,815 --> 00:03:00,715
is the son of the president who was killed in the villa

27
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:02,915
in Karuizawa a month ago?

28
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:05,715
Yeah, no doubt about it!

29
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:09,315
Maybe the culprit deliberately left those letters behind

30
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:11,515
to set the son up as the killer.

31
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:14,215
If so, I'm sure the culprit

32
00:03:14,215 --> 00:03:15,915
would've left the body easier to discover.

33
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:18,015
The culprit wouldn't have gone through the trouble

34
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:22,715
of using the crazy diamond illusion to hide the message.

35
00:03:22,715 --> 00:03:25,215
If so, it's highly probable

36
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:26,615
that somebody held a grudge of some sort.

37
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:29,215
Yes. The culprit who knew that the son had killed the president,

38
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:31,715
avenged the president's death.

39
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:35,115
I guess this deduction is appropriate.

40
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,715
Well, there's also a probability

41
00:03:37,715 --> 00:03:39,215
that an accomplice tried to shut him up.

42
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:41,415
"SON" is the only message left.

43
00:03:41,415 --> 00:03:42,715
It's only natural to believe that

44
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:45,115
-this is the doing of one culprit then? -So, that's the story!

45
00:03:45,115 --> 00:03:47,215
I gave you all this information already,

46
00:03:47,215 --> 00:03:49,715
so don't you dare come up with any other victims, get that!

47
00:03:49,715 --> 00:03:51,715
Yeah.

48
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:54,315
So the person who deliberately called us over

49
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:56,215
to the president's residence in Osaka

50
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,715
and showed us the trick of the vanishing letters is...

51
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:03,215
Could most probably be the culprit who killed his son, Ikuro this time.

52
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:04,615
Yeah.

53
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:06,815
It seems as if the culprit wanted to tell us to hurry

54
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:09,415
and realize the illusionary trick of the crazy diamond.

55
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,815
It's hard to think that the culprit Ikuro

56
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:13,415
would ever give out such a clue besides.

57
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:15,015
The question is

58
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:17,815
why the President's wife hid the fact about the tiles of this bath room

59
00:04:17,815 --> 00:04:21,515
being the same as those of the villa in Karuizawa.

60
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:26,115
If the culprit wanted us to realize the crazy diamond effect,

61
00:04:26,115 --> 00:04:30,015
it could be that the wife was getting in the way.

62
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:31,615
You know, sonny?

63
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,215
You seem to be talking differently

64
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:34,615
from the way you were a while ago.

65
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:36,515
Because when you were with everyone,

66
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:38,915
you were talking like an ordinary child would.

67
00:04:38,915 --> 00:04:41,715
But, now you're talking just like a detective would.

68
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,415
You see, well...

69
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:45,115
We're just playing detective!

70
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:48,715
I'm keeping this brat company playing detective!

71
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:53,615
Sonny, make sure you don't get in the way of investigation!

72
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:58,315
Because he's a really sharp high school detective, you see!

73
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:00,415
Okay.

74
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:04,415
By the way, did the president talk of me that way to everybody?

75
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:07,015
Yes, with every chance he had.

76
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,815
He used to say, he wish that he had a successor like Heiji, and yet...

77
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:14,815
grieved that his son was no good.

78
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,115
His son was no good?

79
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:20,515
Did he have a daughter or something?

80
00:05:20,515 --> 00:05:24,515
No. I just think he meant compared to you, Heiji.

81
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:30,915
I would like to confirm once more.

82
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:35,515
Is the position that you're standing in right now

83
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:38,915
is the same as the time when Ikuro ate the poisoned baumkuchen and fell?

84
00:05:38,915 --> 00:05:41,315
-Yes. -Yes.

85
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:42,715
Ms. Yonehara!

86
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:44,515
Where were you back then?

87
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:45,915
Oh, yes.

88
00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:47,415
I was at that position you're in right now, Inspector,

89
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:50,715
holding the tray with the baumkuchen on it.

90
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:52,615
What?

91
00:05:52,615 --> 00:05:54,115
Not so loud!

92
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:57,915
You mean the one who killed the president was his son, Ikuro?

93
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:00,115
-It's a secret, okay? -What?

94
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:01,415
Everybody thinks that the incident of the president

95
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:03,315
and Ikuro being killed

96
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:05,515
was committed by somebody who had a grudge against both of them

97
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:08,815
and is one and the same culprit, right?

98
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:11,915
If so, maybe it'd be better to keep it a secret, no?

99
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:15,415
Right. The motive of the culprit this time

100
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:18,715
is probably different from the motive of having killed the president.

101
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:20,015
It could be a grudge against the president

102
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:22,315
having been killed, you see.

103
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:26,415
So, Officer Takagi, won't you ask everybody secretly?

104
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:29,615
Especially find out if there was anyone who specially cared for him.

105
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:32,515
A secret from the Inspector?

106
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:33,715
If you want to deceive the enemy,

107
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:35,815
you have to first deceive the people on your side.

108
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:40,415
Heiji, I wonder what Officer Takagi and he are talking about in secret?

109
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:41,615
Beats me.

110
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:44,715
Talking about talking, what was that thing a while ago about?

111
00:06:44,715 --> 00:06:49,015
You said that you had something you had to talk to me about.

112
00:06:49,015 --> 00:06:50,515
It's not something that I should be talking about

113
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:52,115
at a time like this though.

114
00:06:52,115 --> 00:06:54,115
The thing is...

115
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:55,915
What?

116
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,115
Shinichi did?

117
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:04,415
-What? -Don't worry about it.

118
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:05,615
Ghads.

119
00:07:05,615 --> 00:07:06,815
Hey, hey.

120
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:10,315
What a thing to talk about at a murder site?

121
00:07:10,315 --> 00:07:13,615
And? No one else

122
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:16,615
but Ms. Satake and Ms. Yonehara touched the baumkuchen?

123
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:19,815
You mean Shinichi really confessed to you?

124
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,115
Yeah.

125
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:24,215
I took a trip to London the other day, you see.

126
00:07:24,215 --> 00:07:26,915
And Shinichi coincidentally happened to be there, too.

127
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:29,315
All of a sudden in front of Big Ben...

128
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,815
How lucky, Ran! How I envy you!

129
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:35,715
Really romantic.

130
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:38,715
And then? What happened after that?

131
00:07:38,715 --> 00:07:41,515
Nothing really...

132
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:44,715
You met him and called him too, didn't you?

133
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:47,615
Nothing in particular.

134
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:51,415
Then, you should've called him!

135
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:55,015
But it's like I forced him to confess.

136
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:58,815
And besides, I wanted to keep prolonging

137
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:01,315
this sense of happiness for a little longer, you see...

138
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,815
I sort of felt like if I called him from my side,

139
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:07,815
this dreamy incident would somehow shatter to pieces.

140
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:11,415
You're being sort of lukewarm, Ran.

141
00:08:11,415 --> 00:08:13,715
Your partner's already cornered

142
00:08:13,715 --> 00:08:16,015
and raising a white flag, you know.

143
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:19,115
Why didn't you push him a little farther and soak yourself in victory?

144
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:22,615
Victory...

145
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:24,415
Then, I'll tell you what we'll do!

146
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:27,315
I'll conjure up courage and confess to Heiji, too!

147
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:28,315
What?

148
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:30,215
After that, you should conjure up courage too

149
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:32,715
and confirm with Shinichi whether it was a dream or not too!

150
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:35,415
-What do you think? -What?

151
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,515
Hey, you guys.

152
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:41,015
What are you guys fussing over from a while ago?

153
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:42,915
We're in the midst of on-the-site-inspection, you know?

154
00:08:42,915 --> 00:08:45,515
We're in the midst of an inspection conference!

155
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:47,815
So, keep out of it, thank you.

156
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:49,315
What?

157
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:52,615
How lucky, Ran! Promise, okay?

158
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:59,915
Okay. I'll show Ran what I can do for her sake, too.

159
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,215
Heiji, get ready for this, I'm coming for you!

160
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:06,515
How frightening!

161
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:09,815
I wonder what the heck she's glaring at me for.

162
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,615
Inspector.

163
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:14,715
I think it's meaningless to go any further, don't you?

164
00:09:14,715 --> 00:09:16,615
Right. The question is,

165
00:09:16,615 --> 00:09:20,115
not where everyone was standing at the time of the incident,

166
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:22,715
but how the culprit made that stupid son pick up

167
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:25,715
the poisoned baumkuchen out of the two that were left, isn't it?

168
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:27,815
Unless that mystery is solved,

169
00:09:27,815 --> 00:09:31,015
no matter how much on-site investigation there is...

170
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:34,615
No. This is not an official on site investigation,

171
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,015
but rather, an informal on site investigation performed voluntarily.

172
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:38,215
What?

173
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:39,715
If it's an official on site investigation,

174
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:42,515
you need a warrant issued from court on hand

175
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,915
before starting the investigation

176
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:45,515
and be able to show it at the scene.

177
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:47,115
They would have to make us understand

178
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:49,415
the contents of the warrant, too.

179
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:52,015
Have it on hand before starting?

180
00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:54,315
Need them to understand the contents?

181
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:55,615
That's right!

182
00:09:55,615 --> 00:09:57,815
That method still existed!

183
00:09:57,815 --> 00:09:59,615
Inspector!

184
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:02,215
I'm going to borrow the housekeeper again for a while!

185
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:03,215
Huh?

186
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:06,115
And, we'll borrow the forensic officer who is outside too!

187
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:07,415
Huh?

188
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:10,015
Sorry, but will you conjure some story up for us in the meantime!

189
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:12,815
Ghads, going off on their own like that...

190
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:16,415
-So, there it is? -Yeah.

191
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:21,015
It seems that powdered poison's been sprinkled on the door knob.

192
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:24,215
There's no mistake about this being Ikuro's room, is there?

193
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:26,015
No.

194
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:29,215
But why would there be poison in a place like this?

195
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:31,615
Ikuro didn't coincidentally pick up

196
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:34,815
the poisoned baumkuchen out of the two that were left.

197
00:10:34,815 --> 00:10:38,015
He had poison on his hand even before he picked it up!

198
00:10:38,015 --> 00:10:40,115
Poison was already on his hand when he left this room,

199
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:43,415
grabbed the door knob and closed the door!

200
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:48,415
So, if it were Ikuro who always ate cake with his hands,

201
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,515
no matter which baumkuchen he picked up,

202
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:53,815
he would've swallowed the poison along with it!

203
00:10:53,815 --> 00:10:56,015
I see!

204
00:10:56,015 --> 00:10:59,815
The problem is, who put the poison on the doorknob.

205
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:04,615
Is there poison on the floor too?

206
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:07,415
Yeah. On the floor.

207
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:12,515
Maybe that poison powder was cut off about 10 centimeters?

208
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,915
Yeah.

209
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:18,915
There was about that much open space on the floor.

210
00:11:18,915 --> 00:11:21,315
But, how did you know about it?

211
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:22,815
I see.

212
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,315
If so, it's not difficult to figure out who put poison on the doorknob.

213
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:28,315
If only we can find it!

214
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:29,515
What?

215
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:32,315
Let you check the slippers?

216
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:34,615
What the heck is going on from a while ago?

217
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:36,715
We're in the midst of interrogation!

218
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:38,715
Come on, loosen up!

219
00:11:38,715 --> 00:11:40,715
It's important!

220
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:44,015
Of course we need your slippers too, Inspector!

221
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:47,415
It goes for all of you waiting outside the room too, you know!

222
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,815
Put the slippers you're wearing right now

223
00:11:49,815 --> 00:11:52,515
into the bag with your name on it!

224
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,015
Then, you don't really have any idea of anyone

225
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:03,115
who may have had a grudge against the president or Ikuro?

226
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:06,215
No. I don't know about the son,

227
00:12:06,215 --> 00:12:08,915
but I think the president was liked by everybody, wasn't he?

228
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:10,715
The president was a workaholic

229
00:12:10,715 --> 00:12:12,615
and left his family to fend for themselves, so...

230
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:16,015
It seems that he's been divorced twice, though.

231
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:17,615
Divorced twice...

232
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:19,615
Then, on the contrary,

233
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,015
was there anyone who cared for the president?

234
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:23,315
Huh?

235
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:25,515
Aren't you talking about people who had a grudge against him?

236
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:28,915
Yes, just for your reference.

237
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,715
I guess that would be Managing Director Shiina.

238
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,515
It seems that they used to go around together

239
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:35,615
since the establishment of the company.

240
00:12:37,615 --> 00:12:40,615
Yes. I was classmates with the president at the university

241
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:42,915
and have been acquainted with him for quite some time.

242
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:46,315
Several years ago, I received a bronze fountain pen from him

243
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:50,015
in celebration of my 30th anniversary working for him too.

244
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:51,415
That's...

245
00:12:51,415 --> 00:12:55,515
the fountain pen that you lend Mrs. Wakamatsu a while ago?

246
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:58,715
Yes. It seems he gave the other employees

247
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:01,215
bronze wristwatches, though.

248
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:03,915
By the way, is there anyone

249
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:07,115
who cared for the president more than you?

250
00:13:07,115 --> 00:13:09,715
Secretary Satake, I guess.

251
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:11,815
She took care of the president to the point

252
00:13:11,815 --> 00:13:14,515
where his previous wife used to get jealous, you see.

253
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:18,715
It's only natural that a secretary

254
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,915
takes care of the president, isn't it?

255
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:25,115
But, what does this have to do with anything?

256
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:27,115
Just to be sure, I just wanted to know

257
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:28,615
how much the president was loved.

258
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:31,015
If so, I don't think anyone cared more for him

259
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:32,615
than the housekeeper Ms. Yonehara.

260
00:13:32,615 --> 00:13:34,515
Because her mother, who was a single parent

261
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:36,415
also worked as a housekeeper for this family

262
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,515
and when she died of an illness,

263
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:41,515
he took Sakurako in

264
00:13:41,515 --> 00:13:43,415
and raised her like she were his real daughter,

265
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:46,815
then eventually hired her as a housekeeper here.

266
00:13:49,115 --> 00:13:50,415
Yes.

267
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:52,515
I have no words that can express

268
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,215
the gratitude I feel for the president.

269
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:56,815
He also paid for my school tuition.

270
00:13:56,815 --> 00:14:01,015
But I think Mr. Fujinami the chief designer, liked him even more.

271
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:03,115
Due to his foul mouth,

272
00:14:03,115 --> 00:14:06,115
he was fired from various companies,

273
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:08,015
but he said that the president saw through his skills

274
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,715
and picked him up.

275
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:12,915
Even at the president's funeral,

276
00:14:12,915 --> 00:14:15,315
he was the one who was crying most too.

277
00:14:17,015 --> 00:14:19,115
I see, I see.

278
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:23,415
Hey, Mrs. Wakamatsu.

279
00:14:23,415 --> 00:14:24,915
You're there, aren't you?

280
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:28,015
All we need now are your slippers, you know!

281
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:29,815
We found no poison detected

282
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:32,615
on the slippers of the others, you see.

283
00:14:32,615 --> 00:14:35,915
The poison powder got on the slippers because

284
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:39,615
when poison was sprinkled onto the doorknob of Ikuro's room,

285
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,515
poison powder also sprinkled onto the slippers

286
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:43,715
that the culprit was wearing, so...

287
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:46,715
A space of about 10 centimeters where the poison powder

288
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:49,615
spilled on the floor below the doorknob was made!

289
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:52,015
So, if we check your slippers,

290
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:54,915
we'll know whether you're the culprit or not...

291
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:07,177
Mrs. Wakamatsu...

292
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:08,477
Oh, no!

293
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:11,777
The cause of death hydrogen cyanide again.

294
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,677
Looks to be so.

295
00:15:13,677 --> 00:15:17,477
But, isn't this suicide?

296
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:19,677
When we left this study,

297
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:22,777
the last one who closed the door was that Inspector, wasn't it?

298
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:26,977
But, back then, the vice-president was still alive.

299
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:28,877
If the detective boy from Osaka and his friend were the first ones

300
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:30,577
to open the door of this room and find the corpse,

301
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:32,577
of the vice-president who was in the study,

302
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:35,877
where the police officer was on guard,

303
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:38,677
what else can it be but suicide!

304
00:15:38,677 --> 00:15:41,677
True. If this is to be considered a homicide,

305
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:43,177
it's a locked room murder.

306
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:45,677
In other words, an impossible crime.

307
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,577
True.

308
00:15:47,577 --> 00:15:50,377
It's not impossible to commit, though.

309
00:15:50,377 --> 00:15:53,977
Because there are many suspicious looking things on the table!

310
00:15:57,277 --> 00:16:00,077
The black tea that housekeeper Yonehara served us

311
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:01,877
is still only half drunk.

312
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,077
The cap of the fountain pen

313
00:16:03,077 --> 00:16:05,277
that Managing Director, Shiina lent Mrs. Wakamatsu,

314
00:16:05,277 --> 00:16:07,077
is on the end tip of the top of the pen,

315
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:09,177
with the lid sticking out.

316
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,877
The contract that the secretary Ms. Satake

317
00:16:10,877 --> 00:16:14,577
had asked Mrs. Wakamatsu to sign and stamp is only half done.

318
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:17,477
And the eye drops that

319
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,077
she received from Mr. Fujinami the chief designer

320
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:22,777
seems to have been used just a little!

321
00:16:22,777 --> 00:16:24,977
They're all suspicious, don't you think?

322
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:26,477
In other words...

323
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:29,377
If you use the things on this desk right,

324
00:16:29,377 --> 00:16:31,377
you don't have to be in this study

325
00:16:31,377 --> 00:16:35,677
to poison Mrs. Wakamatsu to death!

326
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:38,777
The thick dictionary that was on the ground near her,

327
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:42,177
and the case that it was inside is super suspicious, too.

328
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:45,977
It seems that the "wa" part was opened.

329
00:16:45,977 --> 00:16:47,677
Judging from the circumstances,

330
00:16:47,677 --> 00:16:50,177
it is highly likely that she tried to look for something

331
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:53,477
using that dictionary, and touched the poison.

332
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:55,977
For example, maybe she wanted to look up

333
00:16:55,977 --> 00:16:58,477
a Kanji character that she couldn't read.

334
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:04,577
If so, the contract that Mrs. Wakamatsu was asked to sign and stamp

335
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:08,277
or the instructions sheet of the eye drops are fishy.

336
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,677
Yes. The culprit who knew that

337
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:12,177
there were some difficult kanji characters

338
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:14,977
or sentences in the contract probably made it

339
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:19,877
so that she would pick up the dictionary that had poison on it.

340
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:21,477
Hey, hold it!

341
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:23,077
I don't think there're any words

342
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:24,577
that the vice-president couldn't read.

343
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,577
She held the top grade kanji evaluation degree.

344
00:17:27,577 --> 00:17:30,777
Besides, if you're going to suspect us,

345
00:17:30,777 --> 00:17:33,177
please do so after you read the letter in the envelope

346
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,777
that she gave to me.

347
00:17:34,777 --> 00:17:36,377
Letter in an envelope?

348
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:39,077
The vice-president had asked me

349
00:17:39,077 --> 00:17:41,477
to submit that enveloped letter to the police

350
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:45,177
if in case something should ever happen to her.

351
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:49,677
That enveloped letter was kept in the safe of this house.

352
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:52,977
The content was Mrs. Wakamatsu's letter of confession.

353
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:56,077
When we rushed to the bath room

354
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:58,577
after hearing that the president was stabbed to death in Karuizawa.

355
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,077
The fact was, his son was standing hiding behind the door

356
00:18:01,077 --> 00:18:03,877
holding a knife and smeared with blood.

357
00:18:03,877 --> 00:18:05,877
She had written a confession in her own handwriting

358
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,777
that she, without thinking decided to protect her son.

359
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:11,977
She protected him because the president's son knew that

360
00:18:11,977 --> 00:18:15,677
she was the one who had been embezzling money from the company.

361
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,677
That's why she made the son cling to his father's corpse

362
00:18:17,677 --> 00:18:19,077
to cover up the blood that had splattered on him

363
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:20,977
when he stabbed his father.

364
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:22,177
Before the police arrived,

365
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:24,277
she left traces of an outsider having committed the crime,

366
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:25,877
hid the murder weapon

367
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:28,377
and on a later date got rid of it.

368
00:18:28,377 --> 00:18:30,777
She also confessed that she hid the dying message

369
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,877
written by the president by using illusion,

370
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:36,077
but it dawned on her that maybe she may be killed by the son one day

371
00:18:36,077 --> 00:18:40,177
to shut her up because she knew of the crime he committed.

372
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:43,677
So, she had written that she would like that dying message

373
00:18:43,677 --> 00:18:46,277
submitted to the police as evidence if ever such a day should come.

374
00:18:46,277 --> 00:18:49,577
This is how the letter of confession ended.

375
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:53,177
Were you the only one as her secretary

376
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:55,977
who knew of the existence of this enveloped letter?

377
00:18:55,977 --> 00:18:57,677
Yes, most probably.

378
00:18:57,677 --> 00:19:01,677
The vice-president seemed to have been opening

379
00:19:01,677 --> 00:19:02,677
and checking the safe every night

380
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:04,877
to see if the envelope had been opened or not.

381
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:08,377
So, maybe there were others who were suspicious of her.

382
00:19:08,377 --> 00:19:12,177
I thought that Mrs. Wakamatsu was hiding something, too.

383
00:19:12,977 --> 00:19:15,177
When I came inside to clean this room,

384
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:17,777
I saw her in front of the safe.

385
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:20,977
"Knock before you come into the room!"

386
00:19:20,977 --> 00:19:23,977
So saying, she scolded me severely.

387
00:19:23,977 --> 00:19:25,177
But, as far as this is concerned,

388
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:28,777
I think the others were also aware of it.

389
00:19:28,777 --> 00:19:30,577
Because Mrs. Wakamatsu used to invite

390
00:19:30,577 --> 00:19:34,277
a lot of company people over to discuss things.

391
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:37,877
Which means, that although not clearly,

392
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,177
all of you knew of the existence of this enveloped letter.

393
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:41,377
Inspector!

394
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:44,577
Poison was detected on Mrs. Wakamatsu's slippers!

395
00:19:44,577 --> 00:19:45,777
What?

396
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:48,877
It seems that she's the one who sprinkled poison powder

397
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:52,377
onto the door knob of Ikuro's room!

398
00:19:52,377 --> 00:19:53,777
There was a residue of poison detected

399
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,277
in between the space of the wooden floor right below the door knob.

400
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:58,077
Moreover, the space taken up by the slippers

401
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:00,977
matched the space where no poison powder was spilled o the floor.

402
00:20:00,977 --> 00:20:02,977
I see.

403
00:20:02,977 --> 00:20:07,077
Because she feared that she may be killed one day,

404
00:20:07,077 --> 00:20:09,877
Mrs. Wakamatsu took measures beforehand.

405
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:11,777
Oh, no.

406
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,477
It could be so.

407
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:19,077
Because it would presumably be very difficult to change her slippers,

408
00:20:19,077 --> 00:20:21,777
and make her wear slippers with poison on them instead.

409
00:20:21,777 --> 00:20:24,477
And poison was also detected from the Japanese dictionary

410
00:20:24,477 --> 00:20:27,477
that was found on the floor near Mrs. Wakamatsu's corpse.

411
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,277
Poison was found only on the bottom

412
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:32,677
left of the side that the book is opened from.

413
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:35,177
But inside the case that the dictionary was put inside,

414
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:37,977
was a bag with poison pasted on

415
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:40,577
and it was slightly torn.

416
00:20:40,577 --> 00:20:43,177
It could've been that someone hid the poison there,

417
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:45,677
where the bag ripped accidentally

418
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,377
and so the poison spilled onto the part of the dictionary

419
00:20:47,377 --> 00:20:49,577
where poison was detected.

420
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:54,377
If so, it could've been Mrs. Wakamatsu who hid it there.

421
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:56,177
It could be.

422
00:20:56,177 --> 00:20:58,377
After poisoning the son to death,

423
00:20:58,377 --> 00:21:01,177
she hid the bag of poison there.

424
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,077
It is also thinkable that be it he was the president's son,

425
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:04,877
a son is still a son.

426
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:06,477
After having killed him,

427
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:08,877
she was probably overwhelmed by feelings of regret.

428
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:10,877
So, she put the poison that spilled out of the bag

429
00:21:10,877 --> 00:21:14,577
into her mouth and killed herself.

430
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:17,877
Maybe she didn't participate in the informal voluntary

431
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,377
on site investigation because...

432
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:21,677
She was already planning to kill herself

433
00:21:21,677 --> 00:21:23,577
as soon as she got to be alone.

434
00:21:23,577 --> 00:21:28,477
Didn't you find anything on top of the desk in the study?

435
00:21:28,477 --> 00:21:31,877
No. No poison was detected.

436
00:21:31,877 --> 00:21:34,577
There seems to have been no difficult words on the contract

437
00:21:34,577 --> 00:21:37,677
or the instruction sheet of the eye drops either.

438
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:39,577
Then who was it that called me over

439
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:41,477
to the president's house in Osaka

440
00:21:41,477 --> 00:21:46,077
so that I would see through the crazy diamond illusion?

441
00:21:46,077 --> 00:21:51,177
Maybe she used you to try it out.

442
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:55,077
Since her husband kept telling her that you were a great detective,

443
00:21:55,077 --> 00:21:56,977
she probably figured that if you couldn't solve the illusionary trick,

444
00:21:56,977 --> 00:21:58,577
no one else would!

445
00:21:58,577 --> 00:22:01,177
She didn't dream at all that you would be bringing along

446
00:22:01,177 --> 00:22:04,477
a genuine famed detective with you.

447
00:22:04,477 --> 00:22:07,277
Then, are you saying that she deliberately committed a murder

448
00:22:07,277 --> 00:22:09,877
right in front of that great detective?

449
00:22:09,877 --> 00:22:11,377
How should I know?

450
00:22:11,377 --> 00:22:15,477
Maybe she couldn't stop because she already laced the poison!

451
00:22:15,477 --> 00:22:17,877
I mean, I hate to say this but...

452
00:22:17,877 --> 00:22:20,077
If the vice-president is the killer,

453
00:22:20,077 --> 00:22:21,677
can we go home already?

454
00:22:21,677 --> 00:22:24,277
It's almost time for the last train, too.

455
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:28,277
I've got to go home and discuss tonight's matters with my wife.

456
00:22:28,277 --> 00:22:30,977
I'll stick around as long as you need me, though.

457
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:33,877
Well, I'd like to ask you

458
00:22:33,877 --> 00:22:35,977
how Mrs. Wakamatsu was acting before she died, too.

459
00:22:35,977 --> 00:22:39,577
Please cooperate with our investigation a little while longer.

460
00:24:00,477 --> 00:24:02,177
"Next Episode" -Talking about baumkuchen,

461
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:05,377
is making me want to eat fish cake.

462
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,577
I get it!

463
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:08,777
An eye for an eye!

464
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:10,977
Then, how did the make that stupid son

465
00:24:10,977 --> 00:24:13,777
pick up the poisoned baumkuchen?

466
00:24:13,777 --> 00:24:16,077
Then, why don't you try it too, sir?

467
00:24:16,077 --> 00:24:19,177
You have to make like you're starved like Ikuro was!

468
00:24:19,177 --> 00:24:22,677
Like how do you make like you're starved.

469
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:24,977
This is...

470
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:30,377
Next Conan, "Design of Poison and Illusion (Illusion)"

471
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:48,177
Next Conan's Hint:

472
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:50,377
"Wristwatch"

00:24:50,377 --> 00:24:51,577
Today is Children's Day.

474
00:24:51,577 --> 00:24:53,777
Conan, how old are you now after yesterday?

475
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:55,577
A secret.
