1
00:01:56,964 --> 00:02:00,763
Conan, what do you want to eat tonight?

2
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:04,764
We had fish last night, so tonight let's have...

3
00:02:06,764 --> 00:02:09,163
Right! Let's have meat!

4
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:11,163
-Meat! Meat! -Hello, there!

5
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:14,063
I thought we had meat just the other day.

6
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:16,363
Let's see...

7
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:17,563
Conan!

8
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:19,364
Coming!

9
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:24,263
Ran, are you sure we're eating expensive steak like this tonight?

10
00:02:24,264 --> 00:02:25,963
"Sachiko Nishimura (29)" -Of course not.

11
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:27,063
-Ran. -I thought so.

12
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,764
-Come on. -You're Ran, aren't you?

13
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:32,463
Sachiko.

14
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:35,263
Ran, who is she?

15
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:38,163
Remember? Back when I dropped my student pass?

16
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:40,263
She the one who found it and delivered it to me.

17
00:02:40,264 --> 00:02:42,963
Oh, she's the one.

18
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:44,863
There. How's this?

19
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,863
Yes, I'll take it.

20
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:49,063
You're the one who bought

21
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:52,563
that high grade expensive steak meat a while ago.

22
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:56,163
Conan. Stop that, will you?

23
00:02:56,164 --> 00:02:58,863
But that wine sure looks super expensive.

24
00:02:58,864 --> 00:03:00,063
Wow!

25
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:02,863
You see, today is a special day.

26
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:05,863
My lover's coming over.

27
00:03:05,864 --> 00:03:07,464
Really?

28
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:12,863
Sachiko is a super career woman.

29
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:16,463
I didn't think she was interested at all in men,

30
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:19,263
but I'm surprised she has a boyfriend.

31
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:23,463
Somebody that she can cook for...

32
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:25,163
Ran.

33
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,964
You have people you can cook for too, Ran.

34
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:33,063
But Shinichi hasn't been home at all.

35
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:35,964
No, I meant Pops and me.

36
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:38,764
Right!

37
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:41,264
However, the following day...

38
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:45,463
She was killed?

39
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:48,164
She was living alone.

40
00:03:54,964 --> 00:03:56,364
Sachiko!

41
00:03:57,564 --> 00:04:03,463
"Illusionary Spring Lover."

42
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:05,764
"Nishimura."

43
00:04:06,264 --> 00:04:07,363
Mr. Mouri, this is not a case where we need you

44
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:09,664
to have come all the way here.

45
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:14,263
My daughter owes her a lot.

46
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:15,664
I'd like to at least be informed of the circumstances.

47
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:18,963
The body was found by

48
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:21,263
a colleague of hers that had doubts about her not coming to work

49
00:04:21,264 --> 00:04:23,063
without reporting her absence, came to visit her.

50
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:25,463
The cause of death is a fractured skull

51
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:27,363
from a sharp blow on the back of her head.

52
00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:31,263
The weapon is a bronze figurine that was found in the room.

53
00:04:31,264 --> 00:04:36,063
The estimated time of her death is last night from 7:30 pm to 8 pm.

54
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:38,763
In the middle of dinner...

55
00:04:38,764 --> 00:04:42,364
Was Sachiko a smoker?

56
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:47,063
If not, this side is Sachiko's seat

57
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:50,563
and the other side is the seat of her guest who was a smoker.

58
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:54,363
It's no doubt that someone such as her boyfriend came to visit her.

59
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:55,563
At about 7:30 pm,

60
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:58,363
The woman living next door heard.

61
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,664
Ms. Nishimura talking to her boyfriend.

62
00:05:01,564 --> 00:05:04,663
Promise that you'll take me with you next time.

63
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:06,163
It's not fair that you go to see

64
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:08,264
such a wonderful scenery all by yourself.

65
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:13,264
Maybe I over cooked the steak.

66
00:05:15,464 --> 00:05:18,463
It seems that her boyfriend's hobby was mountain climbing.

67
00:05:18,464 --> 00:05:20,664
We found this picture here.

68
00:05:24,964 --> 00:05:28,463
Her boyfriend's probably responsible for this crime.

69
00:05:28,464 --> 00:05:30,163
Why?

70
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:35,563
If someone came in and attacked Sachiko all of a sudden,

71
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:38,263
where did her boyfriend disappear to

72
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:40,263
without even reporting the incident to the police?

73
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:41,963
Well...

74
00:05:41,964 --> 00:05:43,163
True.

75
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:46,763
Like I was saying, it's not an incident that calls for your help.

76
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,663
The police thinks that her boyfriend is the killer, too?

77
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:52,564
There is no other possibility taking into consideration the circumstances.

78
00:05:54,264 --> 00:05:56,563
Takagi here.

79
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,364
None? Not even one?

80
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:03,163
All right.

81
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:05,063
It's from the forensic officer.

82
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,063
They found no fingerprints what so ever

83
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:08,563
other than that of Ms. Sachiko Nishimura from the bronze figurine

84
00:06:08,564 --> 00:06:10,563
that is thought to be the murder weapon,

85
00:06:10,564 --> 00:06:14,563
the picture of the mountain, or the wine glass

86
00:06:14,564 --> 00:06:17,563
that they both were thought to have toasted with.

87
00:06:17,564 --> 00:06:19,663
No fingerprints left?

88
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:22,163
No traces of them being wiped off either.

89
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:26,664
If so, this is a carefully planned homicide.

90
00:06:27,664 --> 00:06:31,363
He came to visit her after he made sure that

91
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:33,064
no fingerprints would be left behind.

92
00:06:39,864 --> 00:06:43,264
Promise that you'll take me with you next time.

93
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:51,463
Maybe I over cooked the steak.

94
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:54,664
And a while after they began eating...

95
00:06:56,464 --> 00:06:58,764
He made Sachiko get up from her seat.

96
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:05,863
Why?

97
00:07:05,864 --> 00:07:09,563
Why do you say it's her boyfriend that did that?

98
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:12,263
He was after her money.

99
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:13,663
There is nothing valuable

100
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:15,564
such as money and jewelry anywhere in sight.

101
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:19,863
That's hard to believe, isn't it, Conan?

102
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:23,563
Because Sachiko looked so happy yesterday, didn't she?

103
00:07:23,564 --> 00:07:25,763
Today is a special day.

104
00:07:25,764 --> 00:07:29,163
My lover's coming over.

105
00:07:29,164 --> 00:07:33,363
That boyfriend...

106
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:35,563
couldn't have killed her!

107
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:37,963
Right, Conan?

108
00:07:37,964 --> 00:07:39,963
Yes.

109
00:07:39,964 --> 00:07:45,063
If so then, Ran, where did that man disappear to?

110
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,764
It's strange that he left no fingerprints behind either.

111
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:54,663
Something doesn't feel right.

112
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:56,563
I wonder what it is?

113
00:07:56,564 --> 00:07:59,663
I confirmed with a colleague of hers.

114
00:07:59,664 --> 00:08:01,763
I was told that she started going with her boyfriend

115
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:03,963
about six months ago.

116
00:08:03,964 --> 00:08:06,063
However, it seemed that he was really busy or something

117
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:10,463
that he only came to visit her on the 25th of each month.

118
00:08:10,464 --> 00:08:13,063
So, it seemed that Ms. Nishimura

119
00:08:13,064 --> 00:08:16,863
always seemed excited from morning on the 25th.

120
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:19,363
Yesterday was also the 25th.

121
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:22,463
I wonder if there's any meaning to the fact

122
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:26,763
that he only comes to visit her on the 25th of each month?

123
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:29,663
It seems that even that colleague though,

124
00:08:29,664 --> 00:08:33,063
was never told what her boyfriend's name was.

125
00:08:33,064 --> 00:08:35,563
Which means we have no clue what so ever?

126
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:38,063
I went to visit her best friend since her school days

127
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:40,264
who lives nearby too, but...

128
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:44,064
No way! Sachiko was?

129
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:46,664
I just swung at air.

130
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:52,963
She didn't even know she had a boyfriend.

131
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:55,763
She hid the fact from her best friend?

132
00:08:55,764 --> 00:08:57,363
Why?

133
00:08:57,364 --> 00:09:01,164
At any rate, it's her boyfriend did it, Ran.

134
00:09:06,564 --> 00:09:07,863
We'll try to crack who the killer is

135
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:10,363
from among her acquaintances as soon as possible.

136
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:12,263
Yeah, please do so.

137
00:09:12,264 --> 00:09:15,963
I'll try and trace what the victim did yesterday.

138
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:18,963
Maybe I'll get a lead to her boyfriend.

139
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:20,164
Yes, sir.

140
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,163
Now that they know who the killer is,

141
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:28,263
I guess there's no role for a detective to play.

142
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:29,664
Let's go home.

143
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:32,863
Officer Takagi!

144
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,863
Please let me go with you.

145
00:09:34,864 --> 00:09:38,463
I just can't believe that her boyfriend is the killer.

146
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:41,164
Ran.

147
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:54,163
What?

148
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:57,763
You saw Ms. Nishimura's boyfriend come running out?

149
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,264
Yes. I think it was around 8 pm last night.

150
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:16,063
But, how did you know that the man was Ms. Nishimura's boyfriend?

151
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:19,863
I think it was on the 25th of last month.

152
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:21,664
There was a big fire.

153
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:27,263
My apartment is right opposite Ms. Nishimura's condo.

154
00:10:27,264 --> 00:10:29,764
When I happened to look out casually...

155
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:36,763
You mean the man that you saw a month ago during the fire

156
00:10:36,764 --> 00:10:39,063
was the same man who came running out last night?

157
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:41,864
His eyes were blood-shot, and he ran like he was lurching forward.

158
00:10:43,264 --> 00:10:45,563
Excuse me. May I have your name, please?

159
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:48,063
Me? I'm Suenaga.

160
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,163
Mr. Suenaga.

161
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:53,163
Will you help us make a composite picture of that man?

162
00:10:53,164 --> 00:10:55,063
Okay.

163
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:57,264
But let me go tell the boss.

164
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:02,863
There's even eye-witness.

165
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:04,863
I guess this is it.

166
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,164
Ran.

167
00:11:08,664 --> 00:11:09,863
With a composite picture in hand,

168
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:11,863
if they go asking around the vicinity where the victim lived,

169
00:11:11,864 --> 00:11:15,663
it's just a matter of time before they find the killer.

170
00:11:15,664 --> 00:11:19,463
But there's something that bothers me.

171
00:11:19,464 --> 00:11:21,064
I wonder what it is.

172
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:24,964
It's about time!

173
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:31,263
What's the matter? Eat, you guys.

174
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:32,863
Okay.

175
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:34,263
Conan?

176
00:11:34,264 --> 00:11:36,464
What? Yes.

177
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:41,263
What?

178
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:44,063
-Good? -It's really good.

179
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:46,363
I'm glad.

180
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:49,463
What's this? Did you make me check to see if it was okay or what?

181
00:11:49,464 --> 00:11:52,363
No, it's not that.

182
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:55,464
But I wasn't sure if it was seasoned enough.

183
00:11:56,964 --> 00:12:02,063
Ran, Sachiko must have been really hungry.

184
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:03,363
Why?

185
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:07,863
Because the steak and salad on her side of the table were eaten,

186
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:11,464
but her boyfriend's side was untouched.

187
00:12:15,064 --> 00:12:18,963
So what, you brat?

188
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:20,763
Not possible.

189
00:12:20,764 --> 00:12:23,063
That's strange, really strange.

190
00:12:23,064 --> 00:12:25,763
What's so strange?

191
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:28,063
Maybe...

192
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:29,563
But...

193
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:32,463
The woman living next door heard.

194
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:34,764
Ms. Nishimura talking to her boyfriend.

195
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:39,463
She only heard Sachiko's voice.

196
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:41,863
Yeah. If that's how it was,

197
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:44,363
it's understandable that there were no other fingerprints.

198
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:49,164
If so, why did she put on such an act?

199
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,063
Hey, what's up with you all of a sudden?

200
00:12:56,064 --> 00:12:58,263
I'm going with her because I'm kind of worried!

201
00:12:58,264 --> 00:13:00,763
Hey! You too?

202
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:02,464
I'm going to eat all this up, you know?

203
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:07,163
Like I told the officer,

204
00:13:07,164 --> 00:13:10,663
I really never heard that she had a boyfriend.

205
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,863
She did have one before though.

206
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:15,363
She did... before?

207
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:17,163
About 5 years ago.

208
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:20,764
A man called Mr. Henmi, whose hobby was mountain climbing.

209
00:13:22,664 --> 00:13:24,563
"Henmi."

210
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:27,063
When was this?

211
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:28,863
About 6 months ago.

212
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:32,364
Was it on the 25th, 6 months ago?

213
00:13:33,364 --> 00:13:37,663
Right! It was my husband's pay day.

214
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:39,464
Just as I thought.

215
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,563
What? Wait...

216
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:47,063
The real killer is not her boyfriend?

217
00:13:47,064 --> 00:13:50,463
It's impossible for Sachiko's boyfriend to have killed her.

218
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:52,063
That's totally impossible!

219
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,463
Totally impossible...

220
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:59,063
If it wasn't her boyfriend,

221
00:13:59,064 --> 00:14:00,764
then the real killer is none other than that person.

222
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:09,603
Mr. Izaki?

223
00:14:09,604 --> 00:14:12,604
Yes. And who are you?

224
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:17,704
There's something I'd like to ask you.

225
00:14:39,404 --> 00:14:41,804
-Mr. Suenaga. -Yes?

226
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:45,803
About this composite picture...

227
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:49,803
I can't remember anything more in detail than that.

228
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:54,503
No. It was impossible to make a composite picture to begin with.

229
00:14:54,504 --> 00:14:55,804
What?

230
00:14:57,604 --> 00:15:00,203
Because there was no boyfriend

231
00:15:00,204 --> 00:15:03,304
that could've come to Ms. Nishimura at all.

232
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:09,303
Because...

233
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:12,103
This is strange.

234
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:15,403
If she prepared this for a boyfriend that she was seeing after a month,

235
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:17,903
first, her boyfriend would take a bite,

236
00:15:17,904 --> 00:15:20,703
and she would wait for him to say something about her cooking.

237
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:22,403
It's only natural for her to start eating

238
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:24,703
after hearing what he had to say.

239
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:26,503
It's unthinkable for a woman

240
00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:30,104
to start eating and drinking before her guest.

241
00:15:31,404 --> 00:15:37,203
In other words, nobody came to visit her last night.

242
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:40,703
Then, why is everything prepared for two?

243
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:42,903
It's for her boyfriend.

244
00:15:42,904 --> 00:15:45,603
I don't know what you're talking about.

245
00:15:45,604 --> 00:15:49,403
Ms. Nishimura happily told her colleagues and Ran

246
00:15:49,404 --> 00:15:53,104
that her boyfriend was going to come visit her.

247
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:55,803
But that was...

248
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:57,404
A lie!

249
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:08,703
Promise that you'll take me with you next time.

250
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:10,103
It's not fair that you go to see

251
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:12,104
such a wonderful scenery all by yourself.

252
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:23,004
Maybe I over cooked the steak.

253
00:16:24,904 --> 00:16:29,503
She acted the whole thing out herself.

254
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:32,403
There can be no other explanation for this.

255
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:34,603
He wasn't there to begin with,

256
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:37,703
so of course, there would be no fingerprints.

257
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:41,703
You, Mr. Suenaga said that

258
00:16:41,704 --> 00:16:45,403
you saw someone that didn't even come to visit her.

259
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,203
And you even helped make up something like this

260
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:53,404
to divert our attention from the real killer! You!

261
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:58,003
Why would I need to do something like that?

262
00:16:58,004 --> 00:17:01,703
You have a friend named Mr. Izaki, don't you?

263
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:03,403
The owner of the liquor shop told us about him

264
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:05,204
and we went to see him.

265
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:11,403
I hear that you were complaining last month

266
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:13,103
that a shopper who patronized your shop,

267
00:17:13,104 --> 00:17:15,103
a woman who lived in the condo opposite you

268
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:18,104
refused when you asked her to go out with you.

269
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:21,603
You held a grudge against her because she brushed you off.

270
00:17:21,604 --> 00:17:23,603
Isn't that right?

271
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:25,903
That's your motive for killing her.

272
00:17:25,904 --> 00:17:28,603
Where's the evidence that I did it?

273
00:17:28,604 --> 00:17:32,503
You borrowed money from Mr. Izaki, didn't you?

274
00:17:32,504 --> 00:17:36,103
But you returned the total amount to him this morning.

275
00:17:36,104 --> 00:17:39,903
Fingerprints were found on all the bills.

276
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:43,904
Your fingerprints as well as Ms. Nishimura's.

277
00:17:45,404 --> 00:17:47,803
You killed her, holding a grudge against her for brushing you off

278
00:17:47,804 --> 00:17:51,203
and stole cash as well as valuables from her.

279
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,904
Am I wrong?

280
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:01,103
Exactly.

281
00:18:01,104 --> 00:18:05,603
But officer, that woman was a liar!

282
00:18:05,604 --> 00:18:07,503
How dare she lie!

283
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:10,003
"The 25th a month ago"

284
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:13,603
I'm sorry. I can't go out with you.

285
00:18:13,604 --> 00:18:16,204
I have a boyfriend.

286
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:20,903
He's coming today again, too.

287
00:18:20,904 --> 00:18:23,803
I thought that it couldn't be helped then.

288
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:25,304
But that night!

289
00:18:37,704 --> 00:18:40,004
Her boyfriend wasn't with her!

290
00:18:44,104 --> 00:18:47,003
She bought wine again yesterday,

291
00:18:47,004 --> 00:18:49,403
saying that her boyfriend was coming.

292
00:18:49,404 --> 00:18:52,103
I went to check it out yesterday!

293
00:18:52,104 --> 00:18:54,803
Please, no!

294
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:57,504
Please leave! Because he's coming!

295
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:03,503
Where is he? This boyfriend of yours?

296
00:19:03,504 --> 00:19:05,404
I'm calling the police!

297
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:19,704
It's your fault for lying to me.

298
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:25,803
She didn't even have a boyfriend, but put on a front of having one!

299
00:19:25,804 --> 00:19:27,203
If she wanted to just put on a front,

300
00:19:27,204 --> 00:19:30,603
wouldn't it have been enough for her just to by steak for two?

301
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,303
She wouldn't have had to really cook the steak

302
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,003
or pour the wine into the glass, right?

303
00:19:35,004 --> 00:19:37,203
Well...

304
00:19:37,204 --> 00:19:40,604
It was a lie, but not really a lie.

305
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:45,703
Yesterday, her boyfriend really did visit her

306
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:48,704
and he probably sat down in that chair.

307
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:53,603
Her boyfriend called Mr. Henmi.

308
00:19:53,604 --> 00:19:56,103
"Kawamura" -Sachiko had a boyfriend...

309
00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:59,604
during her school days called Mr. Henmi.

310
00:20:01,204 --> 00:20:03,104
But five years ago...

311
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:10,403
I'll be fine. I'll be back on the 25th.

312
00:20:10,404 --> 00:20:12,503
The 25th?

313
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,803
I'll prepare a nice meal and wait for you then.

314
00:20:14,804 --> 00:20:18,604
I'd like steak then. A thick one like this!

315
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:25,003
But Mr. Henmi never returned.

316
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:27,204
His body wasn't found either.

317
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:31,803
But 6 months ago, 5 years later...

318
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:35,504
Mr. Henmi's knapsack was found in the mountains.

319
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:40,503
And inside the knapsack, they found films that were already developed.

320
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:43,903
I had second thoughts about showing this to you after 5 years.

321
00:20:43,904 --> 00:20:47,803
But I thought that he would've liked for you to see it, too.

322
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:51,204
Mr. Henmi came home.

323
00:20:53,904 --> 00:20:57,704
Just as he promised on the 25th.

324
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:02,704
It was on the 25th, 6 months ago.

325
00:21:04,904 --> 00:21:07,803
Since then, on the 25th of each month,

326
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:11,103
Mr. Henmi visited her.

327
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:16,104
In Sachiko's heart, even last night.

328
00:21:21,904 --> 00:21:24,403
She decided to believe in him and wait.

329
00:21:24,404 --> 00:21:26,903
She believed that by doing so, he would return.

330
00:21:26,904 --> 00:21:29,204
That her boyfriend would never betray her.

331
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:42,804
Ran.

332
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:12,803
Which means for these past 6 months on the 25th,

333
00:23:12,804 --> 00:23:15,803
she was talking all by herself?

334
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:18,604
I just said she wasn't alone!

335
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:22,403
Ran.

336
00:23:22,404 --> 00:23:26,603
I'm sure that Shinichi will come back one day, too.

337
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:29,703
Thank you, Conan.

338
00:23:29,704 --> 00:23:32,804
He'll open that door and say, "Hey, Ran!"

339
00:23:34,404 --> 00:23:36,803
If he does...

340
00:23:36,804 --> 00:23:39,903
Hey, Shinichi! Where and what were you doing till now?

341
00:23:39,904 --> 00:23:41,703
The first thing I'll do is spin kick him!

342
00:23:41,704 --> 00:23:43,103
What?

343
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:46,803
She has no intention of welcoming me kindly.

344
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:50,003
Not only will I spin kick him! I'll do a heel-drop.

345
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:52,003
I'm training for that time!

346
00:23:52,004 --> 00:23:54,704
I don't think I'll be coming home for a while yet.

347
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:01,603
"Next Episode."

348
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:07,603
No, I... I really went to a class reunion.

349
00:24:07,604 --> 00:24:08,904
That's...

350
00:24:10,604 --> 00:24:14,903
This is not something...

351
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:17,704
all that great, but...

352
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:20,204
What is this?

353
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:28,304
Next Conan, "Love Story at Police Headquarters #5 (Part 1)"

354
00:24:43,904 --> 00:24:46,403
Next Conan's Hint:

355
00:24:46,404 --> 00:24:48,503
"Daypack."

356
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:49,803
The next episode involves two police officers.

357
00:24:49,804 --> 00:24:51,703
A date ought to be planned, right?

358
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:53,104
I wonder about that.
