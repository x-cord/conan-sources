caused by someone wearing a red sheep costume.

5
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:17,116
The murder victim

6
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:20,119
was the head cook of La Mucho, Mr. Wakabayashi.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,321
He became acquainted with a woman named Anri

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,123
through a dating app.

9
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,425
Anri was kidnapped by Red Sheep,

10
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:30,430
who demanded ransom and killed Mr. Wakabayashi.

That's when Red Sheep started appearing on social media, right?

Hold on a second!

Hirasawa, you rented this red sheep costume

52
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:38,152
at Beika Costume Rental three weeks ago. Is that right?

53
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:43,356
There was a record of it at the rental company.

54
00:04:43,357 --> 00:04:45,258
That is correct,

55
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:48,361
but I would never kill Wakabayashi!

56
00:04:48,362 --> 00:04:52,166
Then, why did you rent this costume?

57
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:56,969
This year is the fifth anniversary

58
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,172
of the opening of the restaurant.

59
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,641
I thought I could use the red sheep costume

60
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:04,343
to promote the anniversary event.

61
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:08,748
But wasn't this costume also used for a festival ten years ago?

62
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:11,250
Why would you use such an old costume?

63
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:14,955
The costume itself was designed by me.

64
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:21,160
I thought your main job was that of an interior designer.

65
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:24,263
At that time, I did every single job I could.

66
00:05:24,264 --> 00:05:26,966
I also wore the costume at that festival.

67
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:29,869
So, that's why I was attached to it.

68
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,270
I didn't want to forget

69
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:33,373
the hardships I encountered back then.

70
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,842
But when I told Wakabayashi

71
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:37,944
that I wanted to use the costume at the event...

72
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:39,545
What are you thinking?

73
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:41,547
This creepy costume

74
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:44,450
doesn't fit the image of this restaurant!

75
00:05:44,451 --> 00:05:47,453
He was unusually resistant to the idea.

76
00:05:47,454 --> 00:05:49,555
So, I let go of the idea, even though I was reluctant to.

77
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:52,058
Did you kill Wakabayashi out of resentment, then?

78
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:53,359
I couldn't have!

79
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,762
Wakabayashi was my business partner.

80
00:05:55,763 --> 00:05:58,164
That's how important he was to me.

81
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:02,468
If so, then you would know everything about Mr. Wakabayashi.

82
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:05,071
-What is it? -Mr. Wakabayashi received an email threat...

83
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:08,741
on his computer at 10 p.m. last night, right?

84
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:11,244
The banks would have been closed by then,

85
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:15,048
so how could he prepare the 50 million yen?

86
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,851
In other words, the culprit would have known

87
00:06:18,852 --> 00:06:22,855
Wakabayashi could prepare that amount of money in short order.

88
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:25,258
I had nothing to do with it!

89
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,360
But I saw it.

90
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:30,163
When hearing that the ransom was 50 million yen,

91
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:33,367
I saw Mr. Hirasawa's eyes glance towards the kitchen for a second.

92
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:37,570
It must be because you knew that

93
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:39,773
the 50 million yen was in the kitchen.

94
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:43,243
50 million yen in the kitchen?

95
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:47,346
Inspector, it seems this kitchen cupboard has been moved before.

96
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:49,249
It left tracks on the floor.

97
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:56,757
Inspector, there's a hidden safe!

98
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,162
There's no cash in the safe.

99
00:07:03,163 --> 00:07:05,966
But there is a notebook.

100
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:10,670
It looks like a ledger to me.

101
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:13,373
Is this your secret ledger?

102
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:17,043
I'm very sorry.

103
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:20,546
Actually, I under-report the sales every year

104
00:07:20,547 --> 00:07:23,149
and keep the balance as cash in that safe.

105
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,651
In other words, it's tax evasion.

106
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:26,752
Yes.

107
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:31,257
But Wakabayashi and I should be the only ones in the know.

108
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:33,259
From what you're saying,

109
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,562
you wanted to keep the 50 million yen from tax evasion to yourself,

110
00:07:36,563 --> 00:07:38,965
so you kidnapped Wakabayashi's girlfriend

111
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:42,368
and used Red Sheep to swindle it out of him.

112
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:44,972
What do you say to that, Hirasawa?

113
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:49,342
But if Mr. Hirasawa was the culprit,

114
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:53,246
would he have used his name at the costume rental shop?

115
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:54,347
What?

116
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:58,951
Besides, Red Sheep went viral two to three weeks ago.

117
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:02,255
Since Mr. Hirasawa returned the costume three weeks ago,

118
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:04,157
don't you find it a bit strange?

119
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,760
You may be right.

120
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:10,162
The costume rental shop owner said that the costume

121
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:12,865
has been taken out since it was returned, didn't he?

122
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:15,468
There are traces of someone taking it out

123
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:18,170
in the middle of the night for the last two or three weeks.

124
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:22,441
Is there someone trying to frame Hirasawa for the crime?

125
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:24,645
Speaking of which...

126
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:29,749
Do you have the box that had the costume with you?

127
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,652
You said the delivery company would be coming to pick it up.

128
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:36,055
Right. Was that the box that had the costume in it?

129
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:38,858
There's no way we could have known that!

130
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:43,362
Mr. Hirasawa, was there a shipping label on the box?

131
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:46,465
-Yes. -There's usually a column for writing...

132
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:47,967
what's in the box on those labels.

133
00:08:47,968 --> 00:08:50,569
What did you write?

134
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,372
If I recall, I wrote "one costume set".

135
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:55,441
How could we have remembered that?

136
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:57,743
We didn't see any shipping label on the box!

137
00:08:57,744 --> 00:08:59,745
The costume rental storehouse was old,

138
00:08:59,746 --> 00:09:02,048
and the door wasn't even locked.

139
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:05,151
You could have easily taken out the costume if you wanted.

140
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:08,354
That can't be! There's no way we would know

141
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:10,156
that the lock to the storehouse was broken!

142
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:14,660
Huh? But Uncle Kogoro only said that the door wasn't locked.

143
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:17,564
He didn't say anything about the lock being broken.

144
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:21,567
It's just as the kid says!

145
00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:24,770
There is a padlock attached to the storehouse door,

146
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:26,973
but it can be removed easily.

147
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:30,543
Only the culprit would know that.

148
00:09:30,544 --> 00:09:32,745
You tricked him into saying that!

149
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:35,247
He just happened to say the wrong thing!

150
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:38,250
Ami, it's no use.

151
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:40,052
Ryota.

152
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:43,757
Detective, we were Red Sheep all along.

153
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:47,661
Ami wore the red sheep costume...

154
00:09:49,563 --> 00:09:52,064
and I recorded the videos.

155
00:09:52,065 --> 00:09:54,467
We then uploaded the videos online.

156
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:58,270
So you were the ones behind it after all.

157
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,473
Things are clearer now.

158
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,542
The Red Sheep that Ran and I saw

159
00:10:03,543 --> 00:10:06,645
was tall enough that its horns scraped the ceiling.

160
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:08,748
But the Red Sheep on social media

161
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:11,851
was too short to be able to do so.

162
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:15,955
It means that the person who killed Mr. Wakabayashi

163
00:10:15,956 --> 00:10:18,557
is much taller.

164
00:10:18,558 --> 00:10:20,660
I can't believe you did that!

165
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,461
It's the owner's fault!

166
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:24,063
He heard that you were going to use the red sheep costume

167
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:25,665
to hand out flyers,

168
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,868
so he thought he should tarnish its image!

169
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,169
What?

170
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,371
It was supposed to be a one-time thing,

171
00:10:32,372 --> 00:10:34,340
but once it got so popular on social media,

172
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:36,142
we had fun doing it.

173
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:39,645
Hold on! Who told you that the costume

174
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:41,847
was to be used to hand out flyers?

175
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:45,051
Hirasawa, did you tell anyone about this?

176
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:47,953
No, Wakabayashi was the only one I talked to.

177
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:51,157
I didn't tell anyone else about it.

178
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:56,162
So, that means you two were eavesdropping on their conversation.

179
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:58,264
You must have heard about the 50 million yen

180
00:10:58,265 --> 00:10:59,865
in the hidden safe at that time.

181
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,667
Excuse me, Detective Mouri.

182
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:06,073
Weren't they with you at the time of the incident?

183
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:11,544
That's right! We have an alibi!

184
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:16,149
In that case, who was the one who murdered Wakabayashi?

185
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:28,060
The murderer may well be someone else.

186
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:31,063
But there's no doubt that you two kidnapped Anri

187
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:35,367
and demanded the 50 million yen ransom from Wakabayashi.

188
00:11:35,368 --> 00:11:39,872
The Red Sheep in this video was you, wasn't it?

189
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:42,341
It's not.

190
00:11:42,342 --> 00:11:43,843
Don't lie to me!

191
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:47,346
Didn't you say that you were Red Sheep?

192
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:50,950
I am the Red Sheep from the Internet videos,

193
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:53,552
but not this one.

194
00:11:53,553 --> 00:11:56,455
There's no way there are two different Red Sheep.

195
00:11:56,456 --> 00:11:58,157
If I start counting how many sheep there are,

196
00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:00,760
I'll be asleep in no time.

197
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,262
One sheep, two sheep,

198
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:05,865
-three sheep... -Come on, now.

199
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:07,567
And that is that!

200
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:15,641
Pardon me.

201
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:18,945
Everyone, allow me to make a slight correction.

202
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:25,851
The Red Sheep in the video on that tablet is not Ami.

203
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:27,953
It's not Ami?

204
00:12:27,954 --> 00:12:29,655
That's right.

205
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:32,458
Mouri, what do you mean by that?

206
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,560
Ami is not the Red Sheep in the threat,

207
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:38,664
but the woman being taken hostage.

208
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:40,167
What?

209
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:43,969
What do you mean, Ami is the hostage?

210
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,070
Yes.

211
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:47,840
Anri, the woman Wakabayashi knew through the dating app

212
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:51,744
and who became his girlfriend,

213
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:53,647
is none other than Ami herself.

214
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:58,350
What are you saying?

215
00:12:58,351 --> 00:13:00,653
Ami is my girlfriend!

216
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,756
There's no way that she is the head cook's girlfriend!

217
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:06,759
Wakabayashi didn't know the names or faces

218
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,661
of the restaurant's part-timers, right?

219
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,664
So, even if Ami pretended to be Anri,

220
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,967
he wouldn't have realised it.

221
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:17,570
Ami, tell me it isn't true.

222
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:22,341
In that case, who's the Red Sheep in this video?

223
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:23,742
Hirasawa.

224
00:13:23,743 --> 00:13:25,945
Is it true that everyone at the restaurant

225
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:28,647
referred to Wakabayashi as the head cook?

226
00:13:28,648 --> 00:13:32,251
Well, yes. He was dissatisfied with it, though.

227
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:34,353
He could have set his name to "Chef" in the dating app

228
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:37,656
because he was dissatisfied with his job title.

229
00:13:37,657 --> 00:13:40,359
And there are two people here

230
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,762
who happened to call Wakabayashi "Chef".

231
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:45,965
One of them is Ami.

232
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:49,868
Ryota is right! We've never even talked to the chef,

233
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:53,072
and I don't think he even knows what we look like!

234
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:56,743
And the other is you, Kamio.

235
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:01,347
A month ago, I recommended the dating app to the chef

236
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:05,150
because he didn't have any experience with women.

237
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:08,153
But aren't "chef" and "head cook" the same thing?

238
00:14:08,154 --> 00:14:11,357
Are you suspecting me just because I called him "chef"?

239
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:12,858
That isn't all.

240
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:13,959
Conan.

241
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,862
Will you explain what happened using the sheep's head?

242
00:14:16,863 --> 00:14:18,365
Yes, sir!

243
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:23,469
There's a helmet attached to the inside of the costume's head

244
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,771
so that it could be put on more easily.

245
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:28,541
Mr. Kamio, can I put this on your head?

246
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:30,943
Well...

247
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:35,047
Kamio, please follow Conan's instructions.

248
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,350
Okay.

249
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:42,656
Stay still and don't move your arms.

250
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:53,066
Kamio.

251
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:58,571
Kamio, your nice hair has been messed up.

252
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:01,940
Oh, man.

253
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:05,545
Yesterday, your hair was messed up the same way.

254
00:15:08,848 --> 00:15:11,350
I remember you fiddling with your hair

255
00:15:11,351 --> 00:15:14,253
the entire time very clearly.

256
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:17,156
Well, I came here on my motorbike yesterday,

257
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:18,757
so that was why it was messed up.

258
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:20,659
But didn't you say that you haven't been on your motorbike

259
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,562
ever since you caused an accident?

260
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:26,465
I was at home all day yesterday.

261
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:30,069
I haven't ridden my motorbike since I had that accident.

262
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,471
That's right. I heard him say that.

263
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:35,741
Finally, there is one other piece of conclusive evidence.

264
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:39,545
Officer Takagi, will you examine Kamio's watch?

265
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:40,646
Yes.

266
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:42,948
Please excuse me.

267
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:44,450
Take a good look.

268
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:47,354
Is there red fibre stuck to the strap?

269
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:52,057
I do see something that's red and looks like a thread.

270
00:15:52,058 --> 00:15:57,363
That must be the nylon fibre that's all over the costume.

271
00:15:57,364 --> 00:16:00,566
The fact that it is on the watch strap

272
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:04,970
is proof that he wore the costume.

273
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:07,072
It must be because I put on the headpiece just now!

274
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:08,540
It got on the watch earlier!

275
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:13,145
No. Conan must have told you not to move your arms.

276
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:14,646
That's right.

277
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:17,851
You did not touch the costume at all.

278
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:24,356
Kamio, you probably planted a listening device in the kitchen

279
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:26,859
and found out certain information about the restaurant.

280
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,363
That's how you found out about the 50 million yen in the safe.

281
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:33,966
Ami.

282
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:35,868
Looks like it's over.

283
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,071
Gosh! I knew I should've quit working with such low pay

284
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:41,341
at this restaurant sooner!

285
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:46,945
Ami, don't tell me you've been working with Kamio...

286
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:50,149
That's right. We've been at it for a while now.

287
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,551
I just wanted to mess with you.

288
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:54,953
I used the Red Sheep game to invite you out

289
00:16:54,954 --> 00:16:57,956
so that I had an alibi.

290
00:16:57,957 --> 00:17:00,359
No way.

291
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,263
I assume Mouri's deduction was correct, then.

292
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:06,265
It's true that Ami and I

293
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:08,967
planned to steal 50 million yen from the chef

294
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:11,970
and sent the email threat to him for that reason.

295
00:17:11,971 --> 00:17:14,940
But that was all there was to our plan.

296
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:18,043
We didn't even get the 50 million yen,

297
00:17:18,044 --> 00:17:20,746
and we didn't kill the chef!

298
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:22,948
Are you still saying that?

299
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:26,552
Conan and Ran witnessed you escaping the crime scene!

300
00:17:26,553 --> 00:17:28,954
We definitely saw Red Sheep running away

301
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:31,156
while holding a black bag!

302
00:17:31,157 --> 00:17:33,459
Like I said, that wasn't me!

303
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,260
It wasn't me.

304
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:37,463
What do you mean by that?

305
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:40,065
After Ami went to Beika Park,

306
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:45,070
I put the costume in the boot and took a break.

307
00:17:45,071 --> 00:17:46,473
And then...

308
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:52,644
When I woke up, the costume was already gone!

309
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:53,745
Gone?

310
00:17:53,746 --> 00:17:57,550
That's right! The red sheep costume disappeared!

311
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,155
They're gone? The red sheep costume?

312
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:04,858
And the 50 million yen, too?

313
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,561
That's it! Could it be...

314
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:35,754
Inspector, I have secured the crime scene!

315
00:18:35,755 --> 00:18:37,857
Please come in.

316
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:42,861
Were you the one who murdered Tetsusaburo Wakabayashi

317
00:18:42,862 --> 00:18:46,365
and stole the 50 million yen?

318
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:48,167
What are you talking about?

319
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:53,672
50 million yen in cash weighs about five kilos.

320
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:54,840
So that's why...

321
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:57,443
Ouch.

322
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:00,046
Gosh.

323
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:05,450
That penguin costume hung a bit lower than the rest,

324
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:07,854
and I hit my head on it.

325
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:19,265
I only wanted to catch the culprit.

326
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:22,068
The culprit?

327
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,471
I wanted to catch the scoundrel

328
00:19:26,472 --> 00:19:28,440
who keeps taking out the costume at night

329
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:30,242
without paying the rental fee,

330
00:19:30,243 --> 00:19:33,045
so I waited inside to see if I could ambush them.

331
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:36,950
That's when I overheard their plan.

332
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:40,352
They said they would be stealing 50 million yen

333
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:42,855
from a man named Wakabayashi.

334
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:49,561
My company is about to go out of business,

335
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:51,563
but they were about to get their hands on

336
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:53,165
so much money partly as a joke.

337
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,767
For that amount of money, I wouldn't mind snatching it away from them.

338
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:58,071
So I followed them.

339
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,954
If I wore the costume, no one would know who I am.

340
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:18,658
Leave the money on the ground and run.

341
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,361
He listened to me

342
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:25,263
and put the 50 million yen in front of me.

343
00:20:25,264 --> 00:20:27,366
Why did you kill Wakabayashi

344
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:30,370
while you were trying to steal the money?

345
00:20:31,671 --> 00:20:36,742
When I opened the bag to check its contents,

346
00:20:36,743 --> 00:20:38,944
I found a kitchen knife inside!

347
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:40,746
There was a kitchen knife in the bag?

348
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:43,949
Mr. Wakabayashi hid his kitchen knife in the bag

349
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,451
so that he could protect himself.

350
00:20:46,452 --> 00:20:49,856
And when we saw each other's faces...

351
00:21:09,942 --> 00:21:13,745
I didn't mean to kill him!

352
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:17,350
If only he hadn't seen my face...

353
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,254
"Mouri Detective Agency"

354
00:23:03,856 --> 00:23:05,557
What's wrong with Uncle Kogoro?

355
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:08,460
It seems he can't sleep at night.

356
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:10,862
Sheep keep appearing in his dreams.

357
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:12,464
Sheep?

358
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:16,968
I guess even he's scared of the Red Sheep.

359
00:23:16,969 --> 00:23:20,072
He keeps saying, "Go away!" in his sleep, too.

360
00:23:21,073 --> 00:23:23,041
Don't come here!

361
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:28,046
Go away!

362
00:23:28,047 --> 00:23:30,348
I told you not to come.

363
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:32,351
Don't come closer.

364
00:23:34,654 --> 00:23:37,056
I don't think that's what it is.

365
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:43,863
I'll drink as many as you give me!

"Next Episode" -Mr. Yamakabe, who made his name...

367
00:23:47,066 --> 00:23:48,767
by selling imported goods,

368
00:23:48,768 --> 00:23:51,870
was strongly recommended to write an autobiography.

369
00:23:51,871 --> 00:23:53,171
There are unfortunate signs

370
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:57,042
left behind of the car being used to transport the body.

371
00:23:57,043 --> 00:23:58,443
When the accident occurred,

372
00:23:58,444 --> 00:24:01,547
did Temukai's car have a full tank?

373
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:05,151
It has been a while, Temukai.

374
00:24:07,453 --> 00:24:09,054
We'll save the inspector!
