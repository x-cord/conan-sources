1
00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:06,519
We came to Kanazawa to help out with a town revitalization event

2
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:10,119
called the "Kaga Hyakumangoku Mystery Tour".

3
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:11,619
We went around visiting checkpoints

4
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:15,919
as we would during the actual event.

5
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:19,119
Thief!

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,919
Darn it! You'll pay for this!

7
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:36,119
However, the purse snatcher appears once again,

8
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,219
and attacks Pops Mouri.

9
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:41,019
Or so we thought.

10
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:44,919
It turned out to be a candid camera performance.

11
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,519
But, soon after that...

12
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,719
Akiyama.

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,919
Harumi?

14
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:56,819
Harumi!

15
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:59,819
Hurry! Please call an ambulance!

16
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:00,819
Okay!

17
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:02,619
Hey, don't film this!

18
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:05,019
This is not an act. It's for real.

19
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,619
What?

20
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:08,819
It's not candid camera?

21
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,519
Then, why was Ms. Akiyama?

22
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:20,019
It doesn't look to be a robbery.

23
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:22,819
If this was the doing of a spree killer killing at random,

24
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:25,719
it's strange that there aren't any other victims.

25
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:32,119
Then, the killer specifically went after Ms. Akiyama.

26
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:36,619
Just what is the meaning of this?

27
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:40,819
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

28
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:42,719
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

29
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,819
Candid camera filming develops into a case!

30
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,719
Kogoro makes a fantastic deduction in the footbath!

31
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,219
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:50,019
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:52,519
His name is Detective Conan.

34
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:38,097
"Kaga Hyakumangoku Mystery Tour (Kaga Hot Spring part)"

35
00:03:40,197 --> 00:03:42,297
"Harumi Akiyama (29)"

36
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:51,597
Wait. Ms. Akiyama's bag.

37
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:02,197
This is...

38
00:04:03,797 --> 00:04:07,197
Will someone please accompany her?

39
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:10,597
Ran, you go.

40
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:11,997
But...

41
00:04:11,997 --> 00:04:16,097
Shouldn't Mr. Kuranishi, her fiance, go instead of me?

42
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:19,197
They all still have work to do.

43
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:21,197
Please don't worry.

44
00:04:21,197 --> 00:04:25,197
-"Osamu Kuranishi (33)" -Let's continue visiting the checkpoints.

45
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:27,397
-"Moeko Miyazawa (27)" -Is that all right?

46
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:28,897
Yes.

47
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:30,497
-"Yuzo Tanimoto (57)" -I guess so.

48
00:04:30,497 --> 00:04:33,097
Mr. Kuranishi may be worried but...

49
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:37,697
-"Yuya Tadokoro (48)" -Please take care of Akiyama, Ran.

50
00:04:37,697 --> 00:04:39,397
I will.

51
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:41,397
I'll be going.

52
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:45,797
I wonder if Pops thinks that someone here is the culprit?

53
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:50,097
That's why to keep anyone from fleeing, Ran was sent over instead.

54
00:04:50,097 --> 00:04:53,697
"The 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa"

55
00:04:55,697 --> 00:04:58,197
Why'd something like this have to happen?

56
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,597
Don't worry.

57
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:01,997
I'm sure Akiyama will be okay.

58
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:05,697
Shouldn't we report this to the police?

59
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:07,597
No, let's contact the police

60
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:13,097
after seeing how things turn out with Akiyama first.

61
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:15,997
Knock it off!

62
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:18,597
I'm not the culprit.

63
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:22,497
I'm just saying so because by reporting this to the police,

64
00:05:22,497 --> 00:05:25,297
it may badly affect the event.

65
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:27,797
I know, Mr. Tanimoto.

66
00:05:27,797 --> 00:05:30,697
Nobody's accusing you.

67
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,297
If you get too flustered, it'll make you look more suspicious.

68
00:05:34,297 --> 00:05:36,197
Hey, hey.

69
00:05:38,997 --> 00:05:41,297
Hey, Pops.

70
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:47,397
May I look at the code cards you received from Ms. Akiyama?

71
00:05:47,397 --> 00:05:48,397
These?

72
00:05:48,397 --> 00:05:49,897
Thank you.

73
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:51,697
I've got to go to the restroom.

74
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:06,397
These cards that fell out of Ms. Akiyama's bag

75
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:10,897
are probably the code cards she originally had ready.

76
00:06:10,897 --> 00:06:14,797
Why did she lie and say she lost the cards

77
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:18,197
and make new code cards?

78
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:31,597
Now for the next news.

79
00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:34,597
On May 6, 2010, the man suspected to attacked

80
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:36,797
an elderly man who lived alone

81
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:40,197
and robbed of five million yen in Kanazawa...

82
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:44,197
I see. So, that's the story.

83
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:02,497
He's probably the one who attacked Ms. Akiyama.

84
00:07:02,497 --> 00:07:05,797
But, I don't have evidence to prove it.

85
00:07:05,797 --> 00:07:09,097
The next checkpoint is the last one.

86
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:10,897
But because of what happened to Ms. Akiyama,

87
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,497
we have no more code cards.

88
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:14,897
Therefore, let me give you the destination.

89
00:07:14,897 --> 00:07:17,097
Next we're going to Yamashiro Hot Spring's

90
00:07:17,097 --> 00:07:19,597
-"Rosanjin's Iroha Soan" -Iroha Soan.

91
00:07:21,297 --> 00:07:23,197
So...

92
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:26,597
We've visited all the checkpoints.

93
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:28,297
At the actually event,

94
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:33,997
the participants would have received all the hint needed at this point.

95
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:36,097
The participants will deduce

96
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:38,897
who the culprit is using those hints.

97
00:07:38,897 --> 00:07:40,497
How was it, Mr. Mouri?

98
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:42,897
Have you come up with a good case?

99
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:45,397
Well...

100
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:49,197
I guess.

101
00:07:49,197 --> 00:07:52,097
What a beautiful garden.

102
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,797
Hey, Pops.

103
00:07:53,797 --> 00:07:56,797
About the footage that was filmed for candid camera...

104
00:07:56,797 --> 00:07:58,997
If it's going to be used to advertise the event,

105
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:01,497
don't you think we should check it beforehand?

106
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:04,597
You're right.

107
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:06,597
Will you do that for us?

108
00:08:06,597 --> 00:08:09,597
Sure, no problem.

109
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:12,397
Thief!

110
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:16,697
Darn it.

111
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,997
You'll pay for this!

112
00:08:21,197 --> 00:08:22,397
Idiot!

113
00:08:24,697 --> 00:08:26,897
Are you all right, Mr. Mouri?

114
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:28,697
Yes. Of course.

115
00:08:28,697 --> 00:08:31,597
What an insolent fellow, though.

116
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:35,997
Kanazawa is supposed to be a safe place, and yet...

117
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:40,097
Mr. Tanimoto, you're looking straight at the camera!

118
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:41,297
Well...

119
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:44,397
We, as the Tourist Bureau need to get this message across.

120
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:46,197
You'll pay for what you did!

121
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:51,997
You're the thief I saw a while ago!

122
00:08:53,797 --> 00:08:55,397
Hold it!

123
00:08:55,397 --> 00:08:56,497
Harumi?

124
00:08:57,597 --> 00:08:58,697
Harumi!

125
00:08:58,697 --> 00:09:01,497
Hurry! Please call an ambulance!

126
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:02,597
Okay!

127
00:09:02,597 --> 00:09:04,597
Hey, don't film this!

128
00:09:04,597 --> 00:09:06,897
This is not an act. It's for real.

129
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:07,997
What?

130
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:10,997
No good.

131
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:15,697
I wonder how Ms. Akiyama's doing?

132
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:17,997
Let me ask Ran.

133
00:09:17,997 --> 00:09:20,997
"Kanazawa East Hospital"

134
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:23,097
Please take care.

135
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:25,197
Thank you very much.

136
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,797
Hello, Dad?

137
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:36,097
I see.

138
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:40,197
Then, Ms. Akiyama's wound wasn't all that serious?

139
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:45,497
It seems she's going to have to stay a night just to be sure

140
00:09:45,497 --> 00:09:47,897
and have her brain examined.

141
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:51,297
Okay. I'm glad it wasn't that serious.

142
00:09:51,297 --> 00:09:53,797
Pops, put me on!

143
00:09:55,897 --> 00:09:58,397
Hello, Ran?

144
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,497
Conan?

145
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:00,797
Huh?

146
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:04,497
The reception's bad.

147
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:06,597
Hello...

148
00:10:07,797 --> 00:10:11,497
Ran, I've got a favour to ask you.

149
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:14,997
Dad?

150
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:17,897
Okay...

151
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:19,197
What?

152
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,197
Okay.

153
00:10:23,197 --> 00:10:24,997
That's what you want me to do?

154
00:10:24,997 --> 00:10:26,497
All right. See you.

155
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,697
Thank you. I'll give these back to you!

156
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:35,797
Don't go taking my cell phone without asking!

157
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:39,497
What is it, Ran?

158
00:10:39,497 --> 00:10:41,197
You still have something...

159
00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:44,197
What?

160
00:10:44,197 --> 00:10:47,597
Ms. Akiyama left her room?

161
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:48,797
-What? -What?

162
00:10:57,802 --> 00:11:00,702
Harumi snuck out of the hospital?

163
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,702
Yes.

164
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:05,502
Ran left the hospital room to talk to me on the phone,

165
00:11:05,502 --> 00:11:07,202
and it seems that Ms. Akiyama snuck out then.

166
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:10,802
She left a note saying that there was something she had to confess,

167
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:14,602
so she'd be going to Yamashiro.

168
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:17,002
She's coming this way.

169
00:11:20,302 --> 00:11:23,802
Kuranishi, did you contact Akiyama?

170
00:11:23,802 --> 00:11:27,802
Yes. But, I get no answer on my text mail and...

171
00:11:27,802 --> 00:11:29,602
I can't get through to her on the phone either.

172
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:34,202
But, I wonder what it is that she wants to confess?

173
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:35,902
I'm sure that

174
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:37,802
she either saw the face of the culprit

175
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:39,802
or something like that.

176
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,502
At any rate, let's split up and go look for her.

177
00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:08,602
"Don't be hasty. Let's talk. Where are you?"

178
00:12:10,402 --> 00:12:12,802
"I'm waiting at the spring footbath."

179
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:15,802
Hey, do you know where the scissor that was over here is?

180
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,302
No, I don't.

181
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:41,002
This way!

182
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:52,102
Ran?

183
00:12:52,102 --> 00:12:54,702
What's going on?

184
00:12:55,802 --> 00:12:58,402
Dad called me and instructed me to do so.

185
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,202
He told me to disguise myself as Ms. Akiyama

186
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:04,502
and lure the culprit out.

187
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:07,102
Ran. I...

188
00:13:07,102 --> 00:13:09,402
Stop thinking about anything for now.

189
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:12,302
And rest well.

190
00:13:12,302 --> 00:13:16,702
I'm going to borrow your smart phone and coat, all right?

191
00:13:18,402 --> 00:13:19,802
Hey, wait.

192
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:21,302
I didn't say anything like...

193
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,702
Why you...

194
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:26,802
It's back.

195
00:13:26,802 --> 00:13:28,702
This is bad!

196
00:13:28,702 --> 00:13:30,802
Pops, if you're going inside the footbath,

197
00:13:30,802 --> 00:13:32,502
you've got to take your socks and shoes off.

198
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:37,302
Yes.

199
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:40,402
I did instruct Ran to do so.

200
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,602
What about Harumi, then?

201
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:45,002
She's asleep at the hospital room.

202
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:46,702
Hey, Kuranishi!

203
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,902
Did you attack Akiyama?

204
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:51,002
Why on earth did you do something like that?

205
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:58,902
Let me explain that to you in his place.

206
00:13:58,902 --> 00:14:01,902
The first thing that I noticed was

207
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:05,702
when Ms. Akiyama was carried onto the stretcher,

208
00:14:05,702 --> 00:14:08,702
she wasn't wearing her wristwatch.

209
00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:11,802
But, Ms. Akiyama until right before that...

210
00:14:11,802 --> 00:14:13,902
We're a bit pressed for time,

211
00:14:13,902 --> 00:14:17,102
so let's head to The 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa.

212
00:14:17,102 --> 00:14:19,602
Since the watch wasn't found at the scene of the crime,

213
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:23,002
it's only likely that the culprit took it with him.

214
00:14:23,002 --> 00:14:24,802
But, why?

215
00:14:24,802 --> 00:14:29,002
Then I remembered what Ms. Miyazawa had said.

216
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:33,102
Ms. Akiyama and I were secretly filming all of you.

217
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:34,202
In other words,

218
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:38,002
the hidden camera that Ms. Akiyama in charge of

219
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:42,102
was built in to the wristwatch, wasn't it?

220
00:14:42,102 --> 00:14:43,502
You're right!

221
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:48,202
There was a small camera built in to Akiyama's wristwatch!

222
00:14:48,202 --> 00:14:49,902
Mr. Kuranishi,

223
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:53,502
I'll bet you remembered that after you committed the crime?

224
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:58,702
You were worried that the camera had filmed it.

225
00:14:58,702 --> 00:15:00,602
Because of this,

226
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:04,502
didn't you pretended to take Ms. Akiyama's pulse, take off her wristwatch

227
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:07,302
and take it with you?

228
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:10,502
Hurry! Please call an ambulance!

229
00:15:12,102 --> 00:15:15,702
When Conan suggested looking at the secretly filmed footage,

230
00:15:15,702 --> 00:15:17,302
I was watching carefully,

231
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:22,602
thinking the time you took the wrist watch from her hand

232
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:25,902
may have been filmed.

233
00:15:25,902 --> 00:15:28,402
But it wasn't.

234
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:29,602
Therefore,

235
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:33,702
as a last resort, I had Ran put on an act.

236
00:15:33,702 --> 00:15:37,302
Kuranishi, did you really do it?

237
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:40,502
Why?

238
00:15:40,502 --> 00:15:43,502
She's your fiance, isn't she?

239
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:45,402
The reason was

240
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,702
to keep her from talking about the incident

241
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:48,302
that happened four years ago.

242
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:50,402
Keep her from talking?

243
00:15:50,402 --> 00:15:51,402
Yes.

244
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:53,702
It's the case that was aired on the news this afternoon.

245
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,102
About the elderly man living alone,

246
00:15:56,102 --> 00:16:02,002
who was robbed of five million yen.

247
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,602
What does the case that happened four years ago

248
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:07,502
have to do with what happened this time?

249
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:11,802
Ms. Akiyama herself told me

250
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:14,402
by using those code cards.

251
00:16:14,402 --> 00:16:15,502
What?

252
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:17,702
The code cards?

253
00:16:17,702 --> 00:16:19,802
After she heard the news,

254
00:16:19,802 --> 00:16:22,902
Ms. Akiyama said that she lost the code cards

255
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:25,602
and newly rewrote them.

256
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:30,402
However, she didn't lose the code cards.

257
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:32,002
Conan picked the cards that fell out of her bag

258
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:38,002
and onto the ground at the scene of the crime.

259
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:40,802
These are the original code cards.

260
00:16:40,802 --> 00:16:43,702
These are the ones that have been newly rewritten.

261
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:50,002
As you can see,

262
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:53,402
the three codes that were newly handwritten are different

263
00:16:53,402 --> 00:16:57,202
from the ones that have been originally prepared beforehand.

264
00:16:57,202 --> 00:16:59,402
As to these three code cards,

265
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:02,202
I figured that besides indicating the checkpoints,

266
00:17:02,202 --> 00:17:06,502
they may include another message.

267
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:08,802
As for the first code,

268
00:17:08,802 --> 00:17:12,602
if you replace 1056 to mean the year and date.

269
00:17:12,602 --> 00:17:16,302
It can be read, 2015, May (5) 6.

270
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,802
The letter "G" and the Sword (Ken)

271
00:17:18,802 --> 00:17:21,102
can be read as "Jiken"

272
00:17:21,102 --> 00:17:23,602
that means case in Japanese.

273
00:17:23,602 --> 00:17:27,902
The year 2010, May 6, case?

274
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:31,502
That's indeed the case that was being aired on TV.

275
00:17:31,502 --> 00:17:34,202
As for the second code.

276
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:36,202
The bottom half of the diamond shape

277
00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:38,802
and the diagram of the arrowhead are black,

278
00:17:38,802 --> 00:17:43,702
and there is a plus sign only between these two shapes.

279
00:17:43,702 --> 00:17:48,602
When you place one shape over the other.

280
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:52,702
The blackened part forms a star.

281
00:17:52,702 --> 00:17:54,502
"Hoshi" means star in Japanese

282
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:58,102
and it is police jargon as well, meaning culprit.

283
00:17:58,102 --> 00:17:59,402
In other words...

284
00:17:59,402 --> 00:18:00,702
Star and saddle means Hoshikura.

285
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:06,002
Then, the final code.

286
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:09,302
If you read this as is without calculating it,

287
00:18:09,302 --> 00:18:11,302
it's read, "nishi-san".

288
00:18:11,302 --> 00:18:15,002
If you join these codes together and read them.

289
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:20,102
"The year 2010, May 6th", "case", "culprit",

290
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:22,002
"Kuranishi-san".

291
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:30,502
The real culprit of that case was Mr. Kuranishi.

292
00:18:30,502 --> 00:18:35,402
It seems like Ms. Akiyama knew about this, right?

293
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:38,002
I don't know where she got the information,

294
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:41,402
but she kept quiet all this time about it.

295
00:18:41,402 --> 00:18:42,802
However...

296
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:45,802
But, if it turns out to be a false charge,

297
00:18:45,802 --> 00:18:47,502
it's no laughing matter, right?

298
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:51,102
That person's life would be ruined.

299
00:18:53,002 --> 00:18:54,302
If left as is,

300
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:57,602
an innocent person may be mistaken for the culprit.

301
00:18:57,602 --> 00:19:00,402
Not wanting this to happen,

302
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:04,202
Ms. Akiyama probably decided to confess the truth.

303
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:07,202
And, in order to try to stop her from doing so,

304
00:19:07,202 --> 00:19:11,502
isn't that why you attacked Ms. Akiyama?

305
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:20,902
Exactly.

306
00:19:20,902 --> 00:19:24,402
I warned Harumi on the spur of the moment by text mail.

307
00:19:24,402 --> 00:19:26,402
"If they find out, you'll be complicit, too."

308
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:35,002
That's why Ms. Akiyama used codes to inform me

309
00:19:35,002 --> 00:19:39,202
about it so you wouldn't notice.

310
00:19:39,202 --> 00:19:44,402
I was worried that Harumi would

311
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:47,202
eventually tell all of you about it.

312
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:52,302
I was so worried that I tried to be by her side at all times.

313
00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:57,002
But, finally, back then...

314
00:19:57,002 --> 00:20:01,702
I'm going to tell Mr. Mouri about it, after all.

315
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:02,802
What?

316
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,402
Let's pay for our crime

317
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:08,202
and start over together.

318
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:10,002
Hey, don't!

319
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:13,502
Harumi!

320
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:20,602
I pretended to look for Mr. Mouri and the others,

321
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:23,302
then joined the president and the others.

322
00:20:24,502 --> 00:20:27,502
If it's to save yourself,

323
00:20:27,502 --> 00:20:31,302
you don't feel a thing about some innocent person being accused?

324
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:35,602
If it's to save yourself,

325
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:38,802
you even cold heartedly attack the one you were going to marry in spring.

326
00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:44,002
Just how selfish can you get!

327
00:20:44,002 --> 00:20:47,702
It's too much! Ms. Akiyama doesn't deserve this!

328
00:22:26,602 --> 00:22:28,302
It was feared that because of what happened,

329
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:32,602
the mystery event would be cancelled but...

330
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:37,602
I'll do my best to make sure it won't happen.

331
00:22:37,602 --> 00:22:39,102
Is that so?

332
00:22:39,102 --> 00:22:43,202
This is the story I'm submitting for the event.

333
00:22:43,202 --> 00:22:45,002
Let me take a look...

334
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:51,602
Well, very interesting!

335
00:22:51,602 --> 00:22:55,202
Just as would be expected of The Great Detective, Kogoro Mouri.

336
00:22:55,202 --> 00:22:56,602
Well, the thing is...

337
00:22:56,602 --> 00:22:59,402
When I got up in the morning, I found that by my pillow.

338
00:22:59,402 --> 00:23:01,702
-What? -Oh, nothing!

339
00:23:01,702 --> 00:23:03,502
Being as great as I am,

340
00:23:03,502 --> 00:23:04,802
writing something is so easy

341
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:10,302
that I practically forget that I even wrote it.

342
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,802
Conan, hurry up and go to sleep.

343
00:23:25,802 --> 00:23:27,802
Okay.

344
00:23:27,802 --> 00:23:31,502
That's what I want to do too.

345
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:34,402
Huh? Conan's asleep.

346
00:23:34,402 --> 00:23:36,602
Geez.

347
00:23:36,602 --> 00:23:39,102
Brats have it so easy.

348
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:47,702
I am Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

349
00:23:48,902 --> 00:23:50,002
You...

350
00:23:50,002 --> 00:23:51,302
What?

351
00:23:51,302 --> 00:23:54,002
You said that you'd be home late

352
00:23:54,002 --> 00:23:57,202
since you're working all day today, right?

353
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:01,502
Let's interview the people waiting in line.

354
00:24:01,502 --> 00:24:03,002
It's them.

355
00:24:03,002 --> 00:24:05,302
They're here.

356
00:24:08,002 --> 00:24:09,602
Next Conan,

357
00:24:09,602 --> 00:24:13,402
"Happy New Year, Kogoro Mouri"
