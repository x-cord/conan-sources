1
00:00:01,953 --> 00:00:03,552
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,553 --> 00:00:05,452
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,453 --> 00:00:07,452
The bright convenience store that we all frequently go to.

4
00:00:07,453 --> 00:00:09,252
Something happens in the back of the store.

5
00:00:09,253 --> 00:00:10,752
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:12,652
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,653 --> 00:00:15,053
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,207
Yes, this is the Mouri.

9
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,007
Oh, Conan?

10
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:02,508
Where are you? It's already late.

11
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,507
You're going to stay over at Dr. Agasa's house tonight?

12
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:10,507
Yep, Haibara's cold got worse because of me

13
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:14,107
so I want to take care of her.

14
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:17,607
Okay, but what about your change of clothes and school things?

15
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:21,107
Yep! Don't worry. I brought them all here.

16
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,907
Besides, it's almost winter vacation.

17
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:24,908
May I, Ran?

18
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:29,607
Okay! Take good care of her now.

19
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,507
Thank you, Ran.

20
00:02:31,508 --> 00:02:32,808
See you!

21
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:38,607
You don't have to spend the night here

22
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:40,007
to take care of Ai, Shinichi.

23
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:41,807
I can take care of her myself.

24
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:43,207
No.

25
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,607
It's because there have been a lot of

26
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:48,707
weird people around us lately.

27
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:52,308
I feel like something disturbing may happen soon.

28
00:02:56,708 --> 00:03:02,508
"Convenience Store Trap (Part 1)"

29
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,508
Who are you?

30
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:36,107
Teacher.

31
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:38,008
Jodie?

32
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:43,207
You look very tired, but are you okay?

33
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,007
Oh, yes!

34
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:47,307
I understand that you may be having a tough time

35
00:03:47,308 --> 00:03:48,807
with the bad behavior of the brats of Japan,

36
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:50,607
but don't let them get to you!

37
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:54,608
No! No! They're all good students!

38
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:58,107
I'll have to say goodbye to all of you soon.

39
00:03:58,108 --> 00:04:00,908
It's so very sad.

40
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:05,707
Jodie, you're going to quit?

41
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,307
No!

42
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:08,407
She has some family affairs to attend to,

43
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:10,707
so she'll be leaving us at the end of this month

44
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,508
to return to the U.S.

45
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:18,707
I wonder what her real affair is all about.

46
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,208
I wonder.

47
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:23,107
Although it was only for a short time,

48
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:27,607
I really enjoyed studying together with all of you!

49
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:29,507
I'm sure that you'll be going through a lot of things

50
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:31,107
from now on too,

51
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:35,307
but I know that you'll all pull through!

52
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,607
So, good luck and stick it out!

53
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,708
Jodie.

54
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:44,307
Jodie.

55
00:04:44,308 --> 00:04:46,807
Isn't it about time you tell us?

56
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:48,407
Tell you what?

57
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:50,507
The reason why you're quitting school.

58
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:53,207
What is this family affair that you're referring to?

59
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,307
Oh! That's a lie!

60
00:04:56,308 --> 00:05:00,307
The truth is I've been looking for something for a long time.

61
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:03,707
It's a map of a very precious treasure

62
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,807
and I finally found it.

63
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:08,407
Well, I think I found it!

64
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,407
A treasure map?

65
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:14,507
Maybe she's talking about her first love?

66
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:16,807
But if so, I don't think she'd say map

67
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:20,507
because it would be the treasure itself that's precious.

68
00:05:20,508 --> 00:05:22,207
Oh, wait, Jodie!

69
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,307
You're not making sense!

70
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:25,807
No! It's a secret!

71
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:29,307
I can't tell you two!

72
00:05:29,308 --> 00:05:32,407
A secret makes a woman a woman!

73
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:35,607
-Okay? -Okay.

74
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:37,607
But, how disappointing.

75
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:40,707
I really wish he could've taken your classes too.

76
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,207
"He"?

77
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,407
Oh! You mean Shinichi?

78
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:45,607
Oh, yes.

79
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:48,107
Let him be!

80
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:49,707
He leaves his wife all alone

81
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,107
saying that he has cases to solve, the pits.

82
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:55,507
He would never be able to appreciate the merits of Jodie's lessons!

83
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:57,807
Wife...

84
00:05:57,808 --> 00:06:01,807
I mean how long is he going to take to solve one case.

85
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:04,407
He should just give up and come home.

86
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:07,607
No way, he would never.

87
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:10,407
He'll never run from something part way.

88
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:13,407
Because he loves to put on airs.

89
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:17,507
Oh, that's the thing you love, love, love about him.

90
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:19,707
-Just totally irresistible. -Excuse me!

91
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:23,707
I'm just saying that he likes to put on airs and is stubborn.

92
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,507
Who cares if he comes home or not?

93
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:31,607
Oh! Talking about coming home, did the cool kid come home?

94
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:33,707
-What? You mean, Conan? -That brat with glasses?

95
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:38,707
Yes! He's always at Dr. Agasa's house when I call recently!

96
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:42,007
You mean he ran away from home? How sassy of him.

97
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:43,407
-Next time I see him, I'll... -No!

98
00:06:43,408 --> 00:06:46,807
He's taking care of Ai.

99
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:49,207
He says that he's to blame for Ai catching a cold,

100
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,807
so he's going to take care of her until she recovers completely

101
00:06:51,808 --> 00:06:53,907
and brought his change of clothes and everything over.

102
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:57,307
Oh, you mean that brat has a soft side too.

103
00:06:57,308 --> 00:06:59,208
Well, sorry.

104
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:05,007
Right! Why don't we go to Jodie's condo and have a party?

105
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,107
What is it, all of a sudden?

106
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:08,607
Party?

107
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:11,307
A small farewell party for you, Jodie!

108
00:07:11,308 --> 00:07:13,907
We can buy snacks and drinks at the convenience store!

109
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:15,207
Sounds great!

110
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,607
-What do you say, Jodie? -Okay!

111
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:20,207
Let's go to the convenience store in front of the station then!

112
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,507
Oh, the one that Aya is working at!

113
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,207
Aya?

114
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,607
Was there a student by that name?

115
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:28,807
She's our classmate when we were in intermediate school!

116
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:32,908
She's a cheerful girl, so I'm sure you'll like her too!

117
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,908
Thank you very much!

118
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:44,408
Welcome!

119
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,807
-Excuse me. -Yes?

120
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:52,807
Is there a girl by the name of Aya Nanakawa working here?

121
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:54,707
Oh.

122
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,708
She's inside with the shopkeeper.

123
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,907
How many times do I have to tell you?

124
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:07,007
During peak hours, we're desperate and need all the help we can get.

125
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:09,307
It seems we're just going to have to hire someone new

126
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:11,207
to take your place.

127
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,707
Oh, no.

128
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,608
What's wrong, Aya?

129
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,308
Ran.

130
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:22,607
-Ran! -Aya.

131
00:08:22,608 --> 00:08:24,907
What's the matter, Aya?

132
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:26,607
Who are you people?

133
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:29,407
Friends!

134
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,607
I'm a high school teacher!

135
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:33,407
What seems to be the matter?

136
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:35,507
A lot's the matter.

137
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:37,007
The total sales of the store

138
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:39,907
and the number of items in the store don't match!

139
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:43,507
And this happens only when Aya's in charge of closing the store!

140
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:44,707
How rude!

141
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,607
Why should Aya be blamed for it?

142
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:50,507
Maybe one of your customers is shoplifting.

143
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:54,807
Aya tells me that this shop is crowded in the mornings and at nights,

144
00:08:54,808 --> 00:08:56,107
so maybe then...

145
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:59,407
Yeah, I thought so too,

146
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:01,707
that's why I set up surveillance cameras

147
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,108
when this shop was renovated!

148
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:09,607
I kept very close watch, but there was no such customer.

149
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:11,907
Then, maybe it was a burglar?

150
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:13,707
I thought of that too!

151
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:17,307
That's why last night, I parked my car opposite the store

152
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:19,607
and kept watch right through!

153
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:22,207
But, all I saw was Aya who came out after cleaning the store

154
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,807
and closing the shutter.

155
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:26,907
Nobody came to the store from then to the following morning

156
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:29,807
when the store was opened.

157
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:31,907
When I opened the shop and checked the storeroom,

158
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:33,207
the figures didn't match.

159
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,307
The only thing thinkable is that Aya stole.

160
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,907
I didn't steal anything!!

161
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:42,207
By the way, what was stolen?

162
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,307
A lot of things.

163
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:47,007
Game software, DVDs, CDs,

164
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:49,807
lunch boxes and riceballs, mineral water, Oolong tea,

165
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:53,307
Cokes and snacks including chocolate.

166
00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:55,907
I can just see young kids gather around,

167
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:57,407
playing music and games, watching DVDs

168
00:09:57,408 --> 00:10:01,307
and catching their thrills!

169
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:03,007
True.

170
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:05,507
But, if Aya were the one,

171
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:08,607
wouldn't Aya be displayed on the surveillance camera?

172
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,807
The surveillance cameras are set to go off at closing.

173
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:15,307
Because the electric bills aren't all that cheap either.

174
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:18,107
Then, the light here is turned off because of that?

175
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:21,007
Well, I'm trying to economize to regain what I can,

176
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:23,207
of my losses.

177
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,807
The customers who come to use the restroom

178
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:26,507
are all regular customers,

179
00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:28,907
so they can find the restroom even if it's dark.

180
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:33,707
Aya, have you noticed anyone who looks suspicious?

181
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,807
No. I wouldn't say suspicious, but...

182
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:39,907
There are three customers that I'm concerned about.

183
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:42,307
-Huh? -Is something bothering you?

184
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,207
What type of people are they?

185
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,707
They all come to use the toilet a lot.

186
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,608
Tell us more about it!

187
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,407
One looks to be a university student

188
00:10:53,408 --> 00:10:55,507
and occasionally stands and reads game magazines

189
00:10:55,508 --> 00:10:57,707
until almost closing time.

190
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,607
A game freak.

191
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:03,107
But, he never bought any games here.

192
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:06,407
All he buys are cup noodles and pouched food.

193
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:09,007
Besides, he's pretty selfish,

194
00:11:09,008 --> 00:11:12,007
and cuts in line at the register.

195
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:13,507
Oh.

196
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:16,107
The second one is a man who looks to be a salaried worker.

197
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:19,607
He seems to be very timid and is overly hesitant over everything.

198
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:21,107
Overly hesitant?

199
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:24,007
Yes, he's always looking down.

200
00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:26,407
Even when the university student I mentioned earlier cuts in line,

201
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:29,007
he lets him do so without getting angry.

202
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:31,007
Even when using the restroom, he lets everybody go on before him

203
00:11:31,008 --> 00:11:33,907
saying that he's not in a rush.

204
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:37,107
He always buys things like a toothbrush set, batteries,

205
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:39,607
shaving razor sets and towels.

206
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:43,007
All things you would take along when traveling.

207
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:47,307
The third one is a stubborn and thrifty old woman.

208
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:51,007
Yeah, I know that old lady too.

209
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:54,307
She asks for discounts on lunches that are almost expired.

210
00:11:54,308 --> 00:11:57,107
She lectures telling us to compare prices with other stores

211
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:59,507
and to stay on our balls.

212
00:11:59,508 --> 00:12:02,307
But that old woman's not a bad person!

213
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:03,707
She turns off unneeded lights,

214
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,807
and also told me what temperature

215
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:12,107
I should set the air conditioning at, to save money.

216
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,307
Well, she talks all she wants with us

217
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:17,107
and leaves without buying a thing, though.

218
00:12:17,108 --> 00:12:20,907
Which makes all three of them suspicious.

219
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,507
-Why? -Why do you say that?

220
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:25,807
Because it could be that the game freak

221
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:30,107
wanted the game software that he couldn't buy.

222
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:31,707
The salaried worker may like to go on trips

223
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,207
and maybe wants snacks to take along with him.

224
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,007
And, the granny could've been checking out

225
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:39,907
which lunch she wanted to eat without buying anything.

226
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:43,107
All three of them have a possibility of being the culprit.

227
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:44,307
Gosh!

228
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:46,407
I think that it's more appropriate to suspect Aya

229
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:49,307
before suspecting the customers.

230
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:53,607
So, I've been trying to tell you that Aya's not that type of girl!

231
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:55,507
Give me an explanation then,

232
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,407
of why after scolding Aya last month about the same thing,

233
00:12:58,408 --> 00:13:01,007
the items stopped missing!

234
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:03,407
-Huh? -Huh? Really?

235
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,907
Yeah.

236
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:08,307
Since the items stopped missing for a month now,

237
00:13:08,308 --> 00:13:12,307
I was determined to stop watching the store after closing last night.

238
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:15,307
I figured that Aya finally repented what she did.

239
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:18,007
But, when I opened the store this morning,

240
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:20,907
a lot of things were missing again.

241
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:23,207
She probably couldn't stop herself any longer!

242
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,407
So, if you apologize for what you did up to today,

243
00:13:26,408 --> 00:13:27,807
I'll let you go this time!

244
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,707
If not, you're fired!

245
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,707
Hey, Ran, things look really bad!

246
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,807
Yes.

247
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:37,007
Right! Why don't you talk about this to Shinichi?

248
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:39,007
He can probably solve something like this in no time at all.

249
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:43,007
But, I don't have his phone number.

250
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:45,307
His number is never displayed.

251
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:48,507
How about you, Sonoko, no inspiration at all?

252
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:52,407
If I was inspired, I wouldn't be saying things like this, would I?

253
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:54,407
Maybe we can ask Conan?

254
00:13:54,408 --> 00:13:58,907
He always comes up with interesting ideas and notices odd things!

255
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:01,007
I guess so.

256
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:05,207
Although it irks me to ask that glasses kid, a bit.

257
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,808
He's at Dr. Agasa's house, so...

258
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,708
Jodie.

259
00:14:15,008 --> 00:14:17,207
It's not good relying on somebody

260
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,107
without trying all we can ourselves first!

261
00:14:21,108 --> 00:14:25,007
Let's try to work things out for her ourselves.

262
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:26,307
But...

263
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:28,907
I really haven't stole anything!

264
00:14:28,908 --> 00:14:31,108
You still insist.

265
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:37,407
You never know when you will lose the one you can rely on, so...

266
00:14:37,408 --> 00:14:38,708
What?

267
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:44,910
Be honest with me, will you?

268
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:47,310
You're the one who did it, right?

269
00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:49,210
You've got me wrong, shopkeeper!

270
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:53,310
I haven't stolen anything from the store!

271
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:57,910
I'm sure Conan would be able to come up with something but...

272
00:14:57,911 --> 00:15:00,910
Are you sure that I shouldn't call him, Jodie?

273
00:15:00,911 --> 00:15:06,010
Yes, I'm sure. The cool kid is busy looking after Ai!

274
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:08,810
We shouldn't bother him!

275
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:11,510
I guess so, but...

276
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,610
But if we leave Aya as is...

277
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:16,110
No!

278
00:15:16,111 --> 00:15:19,910
She'll be fine! We don't have to rely on that kid!

279
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:22,410
I, the Queen of deduction Sonoko

280
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:23,910
will solve this case without his help!

281
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:26,111
Oh? Right.

282
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:29,510
First, let's organize what went on.

283
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,110
The total sales of this convenience store

284
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:32,510
and the number of items in the storeroom

285
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:34,110
for some reason don't match.

286
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:37,110
And the items start missing

287
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:39,010
after Aya is in charge of cleaning the store

288
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:41,210
and closing the shop.

289
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:42,310
Therefore, it's only natural that

290
00:15:42,311 --> 00:15:44,810
the shopkeeper suspects Aya of having stolen the items.

291
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,010
But, we've known Aya since intermediate school

292
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:48,110
and know that she's a good girl.

293
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:52,210
So, we think there's another culprit and begin investigation.

294
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:53,810
Everything's okay up to here, right?

295
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:55,210
Right.

296
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:59,310
What concerns me are the three customers that Aya referred to.

297
00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:03,410
One is the university student type game freak.

298
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:08,210
The other is the timid and hesitant salaried worker type man.

299
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:12,710
And the last one is a stubborn granny.

300
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:18,110
Each of them buys different things such as...

301
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,610
The game freak buys only cup noodles and pouched food.

302
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:25,910
The salaried worker buys toothbrush sets, batteries,

303
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:27,210
shaving razor sets and towels.

304
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:29,710
They were all things that one would take on trips.

305
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:31,910
The granny buys nothing!

306
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:34,210
All she used to do was talk to the personnel of the store

307
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:36,410
and buy nothing!

308
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:40,710
All three of them seem suspicious and yet it could be otherwise.

309
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:42,510
Maybe it's just that somebody shoplifted

310
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:44,110
or the store was robbed, after all?

311
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:45,910
I think that's impossible!

312
00:16:45,911 --> 00:16:49,610
The shopkeeper had surveillance cameras set up.

313
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:54,110
No chance for burglars. No can do!

314
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:57,610
The problem is, when she was scolded by the shopkeeper

315
00:16:57,611 --> 00:17:02,210
after he suspected her, the items stopped missing.

316
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:03,910
And yesterday, a month after that,

317
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:05,610
again on the day that she is in charge,

318
00:17:05,611 --> 00:17:08,810
a large amount of things were stolen again!

319
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:10,910
Come to think of it, Aya.

320
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,510
You like snacks and juice, don't you?

321
00:17:13,511 --> 00:17:15,610
You used to be hooked on games too.

322
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:17,010
Hey!

323
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:20,210
We're trying to prove Aya's innocence, aren't we?

324
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:22,210
I know.

325
00:17:22,211 --> 00:17:24,910
Think what he would think at times like this.

326
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,610
What would Shinichi think.

327
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:28,510
What would he think...

328
00:17:28,511 --> 00:17:29,511
The point is the discrepancies you find

329
00:17:29,512 --> 00:17:31,710
when compared with the usual situation.

330
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:35,610
Whenever a case occurs, something is different from the usual.

331
00:17:35,611 --> 00:17:39,610
First, observe very closely and pinpoint what it is.

332
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:42,210
No matter if it's something that anyone would do,

333
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:44,810
or something that's so trivial and apt to occur,

334
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:47,410
if it's different from the usual, it's a great problem!

335
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:49,310
Those more than usual and plain things

336
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,410
are the most worth noticing as different.

337
00:17:51,411 --> 00:17:53,810
Something different from the usual?

338
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:58,910
I see. So if the items only start missing when Aya's in charge...

339
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,910
Do you do anything special on the days you're on closing duty, Aya?

340
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:05,210
Nothing really...

341
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:07,210
All I do is clean the store.

342
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,410
Is there anything you noticed, shopkeeper?

343
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:12,810
No, not really.

344
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:15,610
Anything, no matter how trivial it may seem!

345
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:17,710
Sorry...

346
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:19,910
It's nothing much, but...

347
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:21,310
What is it?

348
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,910
When Aya is in charge, the inside of the store is especially clean!

349
00:18:25,911 --> 00:18:29,010
See, the boxes with the items inside that arrived just before closing

350
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:31,910
are all in order!

351
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,910
The other employees and I leave organizing the boxes

352
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:39,010
to the employees who come in the morning and go home.

353
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:41,810
It's the same with you too, isn't it, shopkeeper?

354
00:18:41,811 --> 00:18:44,510
She probably did it to rid herself of her guilty conscience,

355
00:18:44,511 --> 00:18:46,310
but I won't be deceived.

356
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:48,111
Oh, no.

357
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:51,410
Even for the lunches.

358
00:18:51,411 --> 00:18:54,910
She probably thought it was okay because all of them

359
00:18:54,911 --> 00:18:58,210
were near the expiration date.

360
00:18:58,211 --> 00:19:00,610
But a thief's a thief!

361
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:03,910
I could go ahead and call the police and have them investigate!

362
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:06,411
Hey? The police?

363
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:11,210
Then what is it?

364
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:13,610
Are you people going to figure out what's going on?

365
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,411
And capture the real culprit.

366
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:29,010
Shi...

367
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:30,811
Shinichi.

368
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,511
Shinichi!

369
00:19:50,811 --> 00:19:52,611
Shinichi!

370
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:55,011
Ran.

371
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:58,411
Just my imagination, I guess.

372
00:20:08,211 --> 00:20:12,310
Hey, Shinichi! Where were you?

373
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,111
Nowhere special.

374
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:20,810
Haibara doesn't seem to be around.

375
00:20:20,811 --> 00:20:24,410
Oh, Ai is in her room.

376
00:20:24,411 --> 00:20:27,710
She's still not all that well, is she?

377
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:31,710
She's fine! The heater is on,

378
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:36,410
and besides, I thought it best to leave her alone.

379
00:20:36,411 --> 00:20:40,511
She's probably listening to that tape again.

380
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:48,610
Shiho, don't you regret what you're trying to do now.

381
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:51,210
I'm with you all the way!

382
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:55,710
I'll always be with you, so give it your all.

383
00:20:55,711 --> 00:20:57,410
Mother.

384
00:20:57,411 --> 00:21:01,310
I'll talk to you again on your 19th birthday.

385
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,410
Bye, bye for now. Catch you later.

386
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:05,211
Oh, and...

387
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:15,911
Welcome!

388
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:22,411
Excuse me! The restroom!

389
00:21:24,211 --> 00:21:27,110
Wow, look at the people at the cash register!

390
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:28,510
Oh my.

391
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:31,210
It's really starting to get crowded.

392
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:32,710
Yes, really.

393
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:34,310
Thank you.

394
00:21:34,311 --> 00:21:36,410
Welcome to our shop.

395
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:38,910
Even the restroom's starting to get crowded.

396
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:41,410
Come to think of it, Aya was saying that

397
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:46,210
the suspicious three customers used to use the restroom a lot.

398
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:49,510
We'll get back to this after we take care of all these customers.

399
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:51,510
Go back to the cash register, will you?

400
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,610
Yes, sir.

401
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:55,210
If you guys have no intention of buying anything,

402
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:56,710
go on outside, will you?

403
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:58,210
But...

404
00:21:58,211 --> 00:22:01,110
You're interfering with business!

405
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,711
-Go on. -Wait.

406
00:22:04,611 --> 00:22:06,410
If we leave things as is,

407
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:08,110
Aya...

408
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:10,511
Aya will be blamed as the burglar!

409
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:16,411
Aya!

410
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:21,211
Ran, what shall we do?

411
00:22:22,111 --> 00:22:23,811
Shinichi.

412
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:28,310
What on earth should I do?

413
00:22:28,311 --> 00:22:29,911
Shinichi!

414
00:23:56,911 --> 00:23:59,010
We exclude the impossibilities

415
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:02,510
and no matter how impossible the remaining things may seem,

416
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:04,310
it is the truth!

417
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:07,210
Hurry, everybody! Run for it!

418
00:24:07,211 --> 00:24:08,610
What shall I do?

419
00:24:08,611 --> 00:24:10,910
I could tell them my deduction but...

420
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:15,610
What if it's a mistake? What if I'm off the point?

421
00:24:15,611 --> 00:24:19,210
If you think your deduction is correct, try it.

422
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:21,211
Huh? Try it?

423
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,010
Next Conan,

424
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:26,911
"Convenience Store Trap (Part 2)"

425
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:44,810
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:46,910
"The restroom of the convenience store."

427
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:48,410
The next episode is the last for this year's Detective Conan.

428
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:49,810
There will be a lot of great specials.

429
00:24:49,811 --> 00:24:52,311
Conan's special New Year's gift will start on Jan, 5th!
