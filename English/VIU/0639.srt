1
00:00:02,195 --> 00:00:05,095
The person we saved from a rampaging car

2
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:08,095
was Kaede Nakakita, adopted child of a rich man

3
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:10,595
called Mr. Ouzaburo Katayose.

4
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:12,095
In response to her invitation,

5
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,395
we visited Mr. Ouzaburo's Mansion

6
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:16,095
that bear the name "Red Leaf Palace"

7
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:19,595
and were surprised by the numerous trick art employed here and there.

8
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:23,395
Mr. Ouzaburo's two children,

9
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:25,195
"Ogito Katayose (35), eldest son" -son Ogito...

10
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:26,295
"Nobue Katayose (32), eldest daughter" -and daughter Nobue,

11
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:28,095
had been feuding with each other.

12
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:29,995
Mr. Ouzaburo had become saddened...

13
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:32,195
"Ouzaburo Katayose (68)" -by the two children.

14
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:37,495
That Mr. Ouzaburo died by poison.

15
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,995
But neither I nor Ran witnessed

16
00:00:39,995 --> 00:00:42,195
any suspects fleeing the scene.

17
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:45,395
Was this a sealed room murder?

18
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:46,795
Amidst the escalating alternation

19
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:49,495
between Ogito and Nobue over the inheritance...

20
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:51,795
"Eiko Suzaka (48), chauffer" -Ouzaburo's letter...

21
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:55,395
consigned to the chauffeur, Eiko Suzaka, was discovered.

22
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:59,595
Now, close the umbrella.

23
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:02,495
Gaze at the evening sun setting in the east.

24
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,895
Look at the two rods holding up the red leaves.

25
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:08,395
Search for a longer rod.

26
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:11,895
My dream of the red leaves shall lie dormant there.

27
00:01:13,695 --> 00:01:15,595
Like the fog clears.

28
00:01:15,595 --> 00:01:17,695
Let's see through love and crime as well.

29
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:19,895
A sealed room, a code, the real culprit...

30
00:01:19,895 --> 00:01:21,895
Push through the red leaves and solve the mysteries.

31
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:23,495
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:25,395
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:25,395 --> 00:01:27,695
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:14,191
"Solving Mysteries at the Red Maple Palace (Part 2)"

35
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Putting the puzzle-solving aside,

36
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,620
we've got to protect Kaede.

37
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,820
We don't even know the culprit behind that car.

38
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,020
About that, I have a rough idea.

39
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Ogito did that to Kaede?

40
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,720
See, when he heard Kaede almost

41
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,620
got into an accident with a freak car...

42
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,920
Accident?

43
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,620
But it's because you were walking carelessly.

44
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,120
Even though the chauffer Eiko was with her,

45
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,320
isn't it odd that he'd assume she was walking

46
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,920
instead of riding in a car?

47
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,120
Then could the culprit behind Mr. Ouzaburo's murder also be...

48
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,920
-Pardon me. -Yes?

49
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,220
Since it seems it will take quite a while before meal time, feel free.

50
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,720
"Kaede Nakakita (8), adopted child of Katayose"

51
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,720
Smells good.

52
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,020
Black tea, right?

53
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,020
I'll go fetch Grandpa.

54
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Grandpa.

55
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,320
Kaede.

56
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,220
Was Ouzaburo well aware of his condition?

57
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,020
It did seem he was prepared for it?

58
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,720
Occasionally, he would mutter, "I can't die just yet."

59
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,820
What does it mean?

60
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,320
It means that, once he passed away,

61
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,720
Kaede may find herself in much more danger.

62
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,920
Grandpa...

63
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,120
He promised to drink black tea with me forever, but...

64
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,020
Is it true that Ouzaburo never put sugar in his tea?

65
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,620
Never. Strange, right?

66
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,420
Well, all of us have our own preferences.

67
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,620
But everyone else puts sugar inside.

68
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,620
I put five spoonfuls.

69
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,920
That's too much.

70
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,420
Our spoons are small!

71
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,520
I see. So that's what it was.

72
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
What?

73
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,620
Ogito Katayose and Nobue Katayose vanished from sight?

74
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,420
What were the guarding officers doing?

75
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,520
Yes. But, you see...

76
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,420
This mansion is virtually a maze.

77
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,720
Don't tell me they've fled into the mountains.

78
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,020
There's no escape route in the mountains.

79
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,620
Take a look.

80
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,420
This place is fenced off along the boundary line.

81
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,720
They say an electric current is running through it.

82
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,420
Most likely for the purpose of preventing

83
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,720
an invasion by large wild animals like boars.

84
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,420
It's probably just as dangerous for humans, too.

85
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,920
No. Normally only weak current is engaged.

86
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,620
But when something does make contact with the fence,

87
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,520
an alarm sounds from that shed.

88
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,920
I was informed that the alarm and the voltage adjustment

89
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,520
can be controlled from there.

90
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,120
Over there.

91
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,420
That's the east end of our premises.

92
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,720
Something's glowing.

93
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,920
That?

94
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,620
A mirror was erected on top.

95
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,020
Weird, right?

96
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,520
A mirror?

97
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,320
Help me!

98
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,120
Hey! Did you hear a woman screaming?

99
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,520
Aunt Nobue!

100
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,620
-Over there! -Darn it! Let's hurry!

101
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,820
Darn it! Another victim?

102
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,120
Aunt Nobue...

103
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,420
Kaede, it's best you don't look.

104
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,220
We're too late.

105
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,620
Seems the murder weapon was the arrow on her back.

106
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,120
Huh? There's one more arrow.

107
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,820
What's the matter?

108
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,720
Eiko, Aunt Nobue is...

109
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,320
I knew it.

110
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,720
Detective Mouri!

111
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,420
Inspector.

112
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,720
So it's Nobue this time.

113
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,220
The wound doesn't seem like a deep one.

114
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,620
So there may be poison on it.

115
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,620
It's not an ordinary arrow.

116
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,720
This is a bolt from crossbow.

117
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,620
Crossbow?

118
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,820
Do you know something about it?

119
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,120
Yes. Well...

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,820
It's one of Ogito's hobbies.

121
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,020
But amidst the grove of trees,

122
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,120
where could this have been shot from?

123
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,320
If the shooter had approached her,

124
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,720
she would've taken notice and escaped into the woods.

125
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
If shot from a distance,

126
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,320
the trees would in turn interfere with the line of sight.

127
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,020
You can get a good view from there, right?

128
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,220
My tree house!

129
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,620
So, the culprit shot the bolt from up there?

130
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,120
All right!

131
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,720
-Be careful! -Idiot!

132
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,320
Don't you look down on my athletic skill!

133
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,620
Dad!

134
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,620
Why?

135
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,320
Gotcha!

136
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,320
No mistake about it.

137
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,720
The owner is no doubt Ogito!

138
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,520
He climbed up to this terrace and shot Nobue.

139
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,720
Without using the rope ladder, how did he climb up there?

140
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,520
He must have notched the ladder

141
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,920
after putting down his crossbow.

142
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,420
There was no crossbow there when you climbed up earlier, right?

143
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,520
No.

144
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,020
Kaede climbed up the tree trunk earlier,

145
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,020
and the notch was already there!

146
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,620
What now?

147
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,620
In that case,

148
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,620
I bet Ogito also climbed up the tree.

149
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,620
But isn't it odd to leave the murder weapon crossbow there?

150
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,720
Who knows?

151
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,720
That Ogito guy must just be really forgetful!

152
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,420
Yes.

153
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,820
Is that so? Thank you.

154
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,920
Inspector, according to the forensic results,

155
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,920
among the two bolts, the one piercing the victim

156
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,820
tested positive for poison from aconitine derivatives,

157
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,220
but the other tested negative.

158
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,120
It was cyanide in Ouzaburo's case,

159
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,520
and aconitine this time?

160
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,720
One more thing.

161
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,420
On Nobue's left sleeve,

162
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,820
they've found a tear as if it was cut by something.

163
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,720
I'm certain that things went like this:

164
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,120
The first bolt that Ogito shot from this tree house

165
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,920
tore through Nobue's clothes.

166
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,320
Soon after Nobue noticed she was being targeted,

167
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,220
she let out a "Help me" scream

168
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,920
and fled into the woods.

169
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,820
However, the second bolt with poison hit her,

170
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,520
and resulted in her death.

171
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,320
Why wasn't the first bolt laced with poison, though?

172
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,720
That... that's because...

173
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,720
There was only enough poison for one bolt!

174
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,020
What's this?

175
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,520
Somebody must have come into contact with the fence

176
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,620
and set off the alarm!

177
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,820
By fence, you mean the one with the electric current?

178
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,020
Yes.

179
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,420
Don't tell me it's Ogito?

180
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,220
What's the matter?

181
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,420
Inspector! Our missing suspect, Ogito Katayose

182
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,820
was found to have fallen off a cliff!

183
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,689
What? What'd you say?

184
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:40,513
Where is Ogito Katayose?

185
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:43,813
Sir! In the mountain stream below us!

186
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,610
So, he fell from here?

187
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,010
It was a full-on jolt?

188
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,110
I see! That must mean the culprit isn't Ogito!

189
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,110
What? Why that?

190
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,110
Every occupant of this domicile knows

191
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,210
that the fence here is electric fired.

192
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,510
I don't believe they would touch the fence by mistake.

193
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,610
In other words, someone pushed him off?

194
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,910
Hey, look at that!

195
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,110
What's that mounted on top of the pole?

196
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,810
Looks like a mirror.

197
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,310
It's true, but that mirror...

198
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,410
Where is it facing?

199
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,010
I've got it!

200
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,110
As long as it doesn't rain,

201
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,810
the mirror will directly reflect the setting sun!

202
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,110
So that's why it tells us to "Close the umbrella"!

203
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,610
With that said, the remaining puzzle is...

204
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,010
Which is longer, the horizontal or the vertical one?

205
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,410
The vertical pole looks longer to me.

206
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,210
Looks like we need to investigate the inside of the poles.

207
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,010
-Roger. -Inspector!

208
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,210
Officers who descended into the valley

209
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,410
have confirmed Ogito Katayose's death.

210
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,510
We shall commence the transport of his body immediately.

211
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,110
Inspector! All the mysteries have thawed out!

212
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,510
What?

213
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,610
The culprit responsible for the murders

214
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,810
of Mr. Ouzaburo, Nobue and Ogito...

215
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,910
is you!

216
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,710
Miss Eiko Suzaka!

217
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,210
What?

218
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,310
No... no way.

219
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,810
I didn't do anything.

220
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:22,210
Presumably, Mr. Ouzaburo had already prepared a will ante mortem.

221
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,410
On the occasion of both Ogito's and Nobue's deaths,

222
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,310
you would become the beneficiary of his inheritance

223
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,210
or something along those lines, right?

224
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,810
Dazzled by the inheritance,

225
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,210
you killed them one by one!

226
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,510
Enough of the silliness already!

227
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,810
No, that must be it!

228
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,910
Inspector! Hurry up and investigate!

229
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,910
Before I do,

230
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,010
are you saying you can elucidate the sealed room mystery?

231
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,910
Nah, I mean that...

232
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,810
Well, sooner or later, I'll figure it out.

233
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,710
That's a bit irresponsible, isn't it?

234
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,010
Pops, leave the rest to me!

235
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,510
Detective Mouri?

236
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,210
Though the colorful something smells good...

237
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,510
It will scatter eventually...

238
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,110
Detective Mouri?

239
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,710
My apologies, pardon me.

240
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,210
Now, allow me to explain in a more responsible manner.

241
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,910
Let's start from the sealed room mystery.

242
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,910
Ran was in a position where she could monitor

243
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,110
who was coming and going from Mr. Ouzaburo Katayose's annex.

244
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,310
Beyond that, Conan and Kaede were also in a position

245
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,510
where the annex was in plain sight.

246
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,810
The scene resembled a sealed room with iron walls

247
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,210
under the surveillance of those three.

248
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,110
Moreover, there isn't any secret underground tunnel, right?

249
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,810
Of course not.

250
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,010
In that case, there is only one answer.

251
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,210
It would have been impossible

252
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,610
for any perpetrator to depart the scene.

253
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,610
What are you saying?

254
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,910
There wasn't anyone else at the scene apart from the victim!

255
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,210
I'm saying that's the true answer!

256
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,610
What now?

257
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,910
Then, Mr. Ouzaburo...

258
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,210
Committed suicide?

259
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,410
What in the world do you think you're saying?

260
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,710
The black tea also belonging to the guest was inside that room!

261
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,610
The cup was steaming, too.

262
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,910
That black was a work of disguise from Mr. Ouzaburo.

263
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,910
In order to make it seem as if a guest had been invited.

264
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,210
How can you be so sure of that?

265
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,010
-There was no spoon. -What?

266
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,010
Mr. Ouzaburo, lacking the habit of adding sugar,

267
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,810
had no need for spoons even for mixing milk.

268
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,810
That's why he carelessly neglected

269
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,610
to prepare a spoon for the "guest".

270
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,710
To think he went as far as to prepare a sugar pot,

271
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,610
I can only say it was a gross oversight on his part.

272
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,310
No way!

273
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,310
The reason for suicide was inheritance trouble.

274
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,310
Ogito and Nobue both

275
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,310
seemed to be in extremely tight spots, financially.

276
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,910
But that's precisely why Master was worried

277
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,010
and thought he couldn't die just yet.

278
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,110
So, why did he kill himself?

279
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,810
Remind me again of the reason why he "couldn't die just yet"?

280
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,310
He thought that if he died,

281
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,710
the two of them would endanger Kaede's life.

282
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,710
But unfortunately,

283
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,110
Mr. Ouzaburo took the fact that he won't last long to heart.

284
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,410
"In that case,

285
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,510
I shall expunge the two from Kaede once and for all."

286
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,210
What might happen if we assume that?

287
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,310
I see. That's why he committed suicide

288
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,110
and disguised it as a murder by poison.

289
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,910
But even so, why would he go as far as to invite Detective Mouri

290
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,810
if he planned to commit suicide?

291
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,310
No, on the contrary...

292
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,910
Mr. Ouzaburo is fond of tricks.

293
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,310
He likely intended to challenge me to the mysteries.

294
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,010
I see.

295
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,610
Then, what about Nobue?

296
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,610
What we saw earlier was supposed to be Nobue's acting.

297
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,310
Acting?

298
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,310
She tore her own clothes with one of Ogito's arrow

299
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,310
that she obtained somewhere, and let out a scream.

300
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,810
By doing so, she made it appear as if Ogito was attacking her.

301
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,810
But Nobue was shot in the back with an arrow and killed.

302
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,510
According to Nobue's plan,

303
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,310
she was supposed to feign unconsciousness

304
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,110
and wait for our arrival.

305
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,610
However, Ogito showed up before we did.

306
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,610
What?

307
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,210
Then, don't tell me he saw Nobue faking unconsciousness.

308
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,710
Exactly.

309
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,610
And he stabbed her with the poisonous bolt.

310
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,010
Please hold on.

311
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,210
Why would he conveniently be carrying a poisonous arrow?

312
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,010
I think he prepared one beforehand.

313
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,310
-What? -Mr. Ogito told me that

314
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,210
when he went boar hunting,

315
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:35,510
he would apply poison derived from wild plants to his arrow.

316
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,110
I see.

317
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,510
Nobue orchestrated an attempted murder

318
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,310
all for the purpose of framing Ogito.

319
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,210
Upon doing so, she would be able to gain all of the inheritance.

320
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,610
However, Ogito took advantage of it,

321
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,410
and killed her instead, right?

322
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,510
In that case, the one who put the crossbow by the tree house was...

323
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,110
It's Nobue.

324
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,710
After presumably tossing it up there from below.

325
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,610
Since she didn't use the rope ladder,

326
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,010
she didn't notice the notch in it.

327
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,910
In short, the one who made the notch was Ogito.

328
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,910
Then, Ogito was following Nobue?

329
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,210
In order to kill her when the opportunity arose?

330
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,610
No. If that were the case,

331
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,410
he would've carried the bow as well instead of just the bolt.

332
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,510
Ogito brought only the bolt with him upon leaving the mansion.

333
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:23,110
I gather that he already solved the code long before us.

334
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,110
The bolt was probably for probing the inside of the pole,

335
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,710
which is likely where the hidden fortune is located.

336
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,210
I see.

337
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,310
But, can you prove that he indeed stabbed Nobue on the spot?

338
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,310
Good question.

339
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,410
I believe Eiko could have.

340
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,210
What?

341
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,510
You had a slip of the tongue, right?

342
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,210
After hearing about Nobue's death,

343
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,610
you uttered "I knew it".

344
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,010
What did you mean by that?

345
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,410
That's...

346
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,510
You were suspecting Ogito at first.

347
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,310
That he was aiming for Kaede's life,

348
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,410
and finally poisoned Mr. Ouzaburo to death today.

349
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,810
With that thought in mind,

350
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,710
you kept a watchful eye on his actions, didn't you?

351
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,910
No, I would never.

352
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,510
It follows that

353
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,610
you also saw the scene in which Ogito stabbed Nobue.

354
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,210
Since you couldn't ascertain the situation from a distant view,

355
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,310
as soon as Nobue's death was confirmed,

356
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,410
you uttered "I knew it".

357
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,010
After finishing off Nobue, Ogito came here

358
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,510
and climbed up the fence to check the poles,

359
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,610
and fell to his death due to electric shock.

360
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,510
I doubt that's the case.

361
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,110
Eiko. When the alarm sounded,

362
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,410
you said, "Somebody must have touched the fence".

363
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,410
Why "somebody"?

364
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,510
Why not "something" like animals?

365
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,410
Monitoring Ogito's every move,

366
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,510
you witnessed him coming out of the shed

367
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,910
where the controls for the electrified fence and alarm were.

368
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,010
You entered the shed after Ogito's departure,

369
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,010
and found the electric current and alarm cut off.

370
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,910
Perhaps you already knew the meaning

371
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,610
behind the cipher from the very beginning?

372
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,110
If Mr. Ouzaburo were to hide something inside the pole,

373
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,510
he would have required someone else's help.

374
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,710
Then, realizing Ogito must've also figured out the code

375
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,710
by turning off the current,

376
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,010
you turned the electric current back on.

377
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,810
Not only that, you also made the current stronger than normal.

378
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,710
What'd you say?

379
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,310
Ogito, operating under a false sense of security

380
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,010
that the current was turned off...

381
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,010
He climbed up the fence in order to search the pole.

382
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,310
I'm truly sorry!

383
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,010
I confess that I did it!

384
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,510
I mistook him for the murderer who poisoned Master.

385
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,110
I'm truly sorry!

386
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,110
What are you doing, Inspector?

387
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,910
They're searching for the treasure!

388
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,510
Hold on a minute!

389
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,510
The code instructed us to "search for the longer rod!"

390
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,710
That's why we've been searching like this.

391
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,610
But as far as I can see, the vertical one looks longer.

392
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,110
But it's the horizontal pole that's longer,

393
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,010
they've already measured it.

394
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,310
I think it's called "Fick illusion".

395
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,710
One of Mr. Katayose's deceptions, which is his hobby.

396
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,510
If you place two lines equal in length in a "T" shape,

397
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,910
you'll think the vertical one looks longer.

398
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,910
They say it's an illusion discovered in 1851.

399
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,010
The poles are based on that illusion,

400
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,310
so the horizontal one is deliberately a bit longer.

401
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,410
Inspector, found it! The treasure!

402
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,410
We police officers shouldn't call it a treasure.

403
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,510
According to Mr. Katayose, it's his personal dream.

404
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,410
This is...

405
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,810
a ruby, isn't it?

406
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,610
A treasure indeed!

407
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,710
There's a letter that goes with it.

408
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,710
It's signed by Mr. Katayose.

409
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,810
"Eiko Suzaka.

410
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,310
By the time you have read this letter,

411
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,910
I believe I will have already ceased to exist.

412
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,810
To you who have done so much for me,

413
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,810
please hear out my one last request.

414
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,710
I would like for you to take care of Kaede after my death,

415
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,010
who shall be the beneficiary of my inheritance,

416
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,910
until her adulthood.

417
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,410
Please accept the enclosed ruby

418
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,410
with this letter as my gratitude.

419
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,910
As for the reason I fixated on that little girl so much...

420
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,110
Instead of laughing at the unbecomingness of an old man,

421
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,910
please surmise looking at the enclosed picture."

422
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,810
These two people...

423
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,410
Their names are written on it.

424
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,210
Ouzaburo Katayose.

425
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,910
Momiji Nakakita.

426
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,010
And everyone was immediately convinced.

427
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,810
The reason it was called the "Red Leaf Palace".

428
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,610
Although they couldn't get married due to various circumstances,

429
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:06,610
but Mr. Katayose had never forgotten Momiji, till the end.

430
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,910
Kaede went back to Hokkaido.

431
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,810
Without knowing what happened,

432
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,210
she enthusiastically vowed to invite Eiko over for a visit someday.

433
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,210
A postcard?

434
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,610
Hey! Conan, how's it?

435
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,710
Today, Kaede Nakakita is as energetic as always.

436
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,610
Conan, come visit me some time.

437
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,010
I shall make you my hubby!

438
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,910
Your hubby...

439
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,510
You wish...

440
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,310
"Next Episode"

441
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,910
Just as expected of Okayama that's famous for peaches!

442
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,410
Even the ladies are nice and peachy.

443
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,810
Please find out who I am and where I'm from!

444
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,910
A jewelry shop robbery?

445
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,010
My big brother clearly told me,

446
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,010
that he's innocent.

447
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,310
Nothing...

448
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,410
I remember nothing.

449
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,410
"If you want to learn about your past, be alone."

450
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,610
That's a bad sign.

451
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,910
Next Conan,
