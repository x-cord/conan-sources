00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:31,684
Sir? Sir?

5
00:00:31,685 --> 00:00:33,085
Chief Kuroda?

6
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:37,884
Is something wrong, sir?

7
00:00:37,885 --> 00:00:40,684
It's nothing.

8
00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:43,084
I was just thinking.

9
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:46,284
Did you need something, Shiratori?

10
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:47,285
Yes, sir.

11
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:50,584
I finished the report on the other day's robbery.

12
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:51,784
Here it is.

13
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,285
Good work.

14
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:57,584
Sir.

15
00:00:57,585 --> 00:00:58,684
What is it?

16
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:01,385
You seem a bit tired.

17
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:05,684
I have a lot on my mind.

18
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:09,384
Why not take a break?

19
00:01:09,385 --> 00:01:13,284
You haven't used any of your vacation time, have you?

20
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:14,884
No.

21
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:18,384
I know. How about camping?

22
00:01:18,385 --> 00:01:21,184
A nice campground was opened recently.

23
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:24,884
Conan and his friends are going next weekend.

24
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,184
I see.

25
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:29,084
The Sleeping Kogoro's adviser?

26
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:33,384
Yes. Normally they go with Dr. Agasa,

27
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,984
but Dr. Agasa is sick.

28
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:39,384
This time they'll be accompanied by their grade school teacher.

29
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:41,584
A grade school teacher?

30
00:01:41,585 --> 00:01:45,084
You know, the one who was in the news

31
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:47,484
for subduing the pro golfer murderer.

32
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:50,085
Rumi Wakasa.

33
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:54,084
I'd actually planned to take time off

34
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:57,384
and go with Ms. Kobayashi.

35
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:59,284
But if we're going on a date,

36
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,585
I thought it'd be better for just the two of us to go.

37
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:07,684
In any case, I'll leave campsite pamphlets...

38
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:09,384
"New Open! Camping and Barbecue Site" -with you.

39
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:11,284
Well, I should get going.

40
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:13,485
Sure. Good work.

41
00:02:17,985 --> 00:02:20,284
If you don't need those pamphlets,

42
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:22,584
feel free to throw them away.

43
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:24,485
-Sure. -Excuse me.

44
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:34,584
Camping?

45
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:36,585
"New Open! Camping and Barbecue Site"

46
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,785
It's not my style.

47
00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:45,684
When the countdown reaches zero,

48
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:48,085
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

49
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:52,484
Chief Kuroda and Ms. Wakasa.

50
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:54,684
The suspicious duo meets at our campsite!

51
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:56,284
He sees through the one and only truth.

52
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:58,084
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

53
00:02:58,085 --> 00:02:59,985
His name is Detective Conan.

54
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:43,571
"Mystery of the Burning Tent (Part 1)"

55
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:50,971
"Toto Forest Campground"

56
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:08,770
All right!

57
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:10,970
We pitched the tent!

58
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:12,370
Good.

59
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,870
Okay, everyone.

60
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:17,770
Could you go gather some firewood for dinner?

61
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:19,270
Okay...

62
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:20,570
Ai, let's go!

63
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:23,171
-There's a bunch over there! -Don't run.

64
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:27,170
Rumi Wakasa.

65
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:30,571
Assistant homeroom teacher to class 1-B of Teitan Elementary School.

66
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:41,570
The other day we happened to be invited to her apartment,

67
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:46,071
and we just happened to get involved in the murder of her neighbor.

68
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:52,170
But the receipt I found in her apartment from that morning...

69
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:53,171
"7mart Receipt"

70
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:58,570
It showed she'd bought plates and mugs for us.

71
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:00,370
In other words, that morning

72
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:03,570
she knew her neighbor would commit a murder.

73
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,570
In order to involve us,

74
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:08,570
she deliberately ruined the screen

75
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:12,171
and invited us to her apartment under the pretense of repainting it.

76
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,370
No.

77
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:16,470
Not us.

78
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:18,670
Is she after me?

79
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:24,070
After all, when we found the skeleton in the old storage shed,

80
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:27,370
the rust on the trapdoor to the basement that hadn't been opened in years

81
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:29,971
had been recently removed.

82
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:35,570
If she discovered the body beforehand,

83
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:39,571
and pushed me to get involved in the case...

84
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:43,171
Could this camping trip also be...

85
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:45,871
Hey, Conan.

86
00:06:47,071 --> 00:06:49,370
There's someone like you.

87
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:50,770
What?

88
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:52,370
Someone like me?

89
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,170
That guy over there.

90
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:55,770
He's just like you.

91
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:58,070
I told you.

92
00:06:58,071 --> 00:06:59,570
Three more.

93
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:01,770
The curry won't be thick enough

94
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:03,770
unless you add three more pieces of roux to the curry.

95
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:06,370
You've got to add at least two more.

96
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:08,170
I get it.

97
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:09,770
That's why Midori's out buying more right now.

98
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:12,470
I see. It's those fingers.

99
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:15,670
That's exactly what a certain someone influenced

100
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:18,370
by his Gallicized mother does.

101
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,370
This gesture means three, right?

102
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:25,070
Yes. That's three, but this is two.

103
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:27,470
What? But that guy...

104
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:29,870
-He did two like us. -I found some. Here.

105
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:30,871
Why?

106
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:33,870
He represents three like this and two like this.

107
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,270
On top of that, his fingers are taped,

108
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:38,270
which means...

109
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:41,570
Hey, aren't you guys...

110
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:43,970
basketball players?

111
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:45,171
What?

112
00:07:46,571 --> 00:07:50,070
Basketball referees extend their pointer

113
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:51,770
and middle fingers to represent two,

114
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,070
but they use their pointer finger, middle finger,

115
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:57,670
and thumb to represent three so you don't confuse it with two, right?

116
00:07:57,671 --> 00:08:02,870
I heard a lot of players pick up the same habit.

117
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:04,570
That's amazing, kid.

118
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:06,271
You're exactly right.

119
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:12,070
I'm the manager of the Shiraami University basketball team.

120
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:13,870
My name is Midori Furuoka.

121
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:17,070
And the guy stirring the curry

122
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:19,870
is the man who became our star player this year.

123
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:21,470
Sumito Ashizawa.

124
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:24,370
"Sumito Ashizawa (22)" -What? Don't call me that.

125
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,670
I was riding the bench until last year.

126
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:29,670
But you've been approached by professional teams, right?

127
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:33,670
The other day, a scout came to meet you before the game.

128
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:35,770
It was a coincidence.

129
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:39,570
I hope we'll still be friends even after you become famous.

130
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:40,571
Sure.

131
00:08:40,572 --> 00:08:43,270
"Fumiaki Urushibara (22)" -I'm the cornerstone

132
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:45,070
of our team's defense.

133
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:47,070
My name is Fumiaki Urushibara.

134
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:50,771
I'm a stickler when it comes to defending and making curry.

135
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:54,770
I'm former ace who was blinded

136
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:56,770
by the cornerstone of our defense.

137
00:08:56,771 --> 00:08:59,470
And I'm Kuninori Danno.

138
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:01,670
Blinded?

139
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,470
Seriously?

140
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:07,270
Yes. I gently bumped him with my elbow during practice.

141
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:09,070
It wasn't gentle!

142
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:10,570
I nearly lost my sight.

143
00:09:10,571 --> 00:09:12,571
I almost got a glass eye!

144
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:35,471
She's grasping something.

145
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:39,270
What is it?

146
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:41,070
What could it be?

147
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,970
Yes, but...

148
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:46,170
because of that, you got closer to Midori, right?

149
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:48,070
You should be thanking me.

150
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:49,071
What?

151
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:51,970
Urushibara, that's going too far.

152
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:53,471
What?

153
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:58,670
Watch what you say, Ashizawa.

154
00:09:58,671 --> 00:10:02,470
I could crush you anytime I wanted.

155
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:04,470
Just like Danno!

156
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,971
You jerk.

157
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:14,470
I've had enough.

158
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:15,970
I knew shouldn't have come.

159
00:10:15,971 --> 00:10:17,570
Hey.

160
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:20,170
I'm going to drink, have some snacks,

161
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:21,670
and go to bed.

162
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:24,570
Wake me before you leave tomorrow.

163
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:26,071
Wait, Urushibara!

164
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:32,770
This is bad.

165
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:34,370
I invited everyone camping

166
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:37,370
because things have been tense recently.

167
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,670
Sorry. I just couldn't take it.

168
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:43,470
Now, now. He'll feel better once he has some curry.

169
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:46,071
He loves curry.

170
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:11,470
That's good!

171
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,770
This curry is really good!

172
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:15,470
Yes, it's delicious.

173
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:19,670
Curry tastes better when you make a lot of it.

174
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:21,070
That's great.

175
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:23,970
There's more, so eat all you want.

176
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:25,270
Okay...

177
00:11:25,271 --> 00:11:29,370
Thank you for letting us join you.

178
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:31,570
Don't worry about it.

179
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:34,370
We just combined your ingredients with ours.

180
00:11:34,371 --> 00:11:37,670
And food tastes better when you're sharing it with a large group.

181
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:39,670
I agree.

182
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:41,970
It's no use.

183
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:45,970
Urushibara's hiding in his tent and won't even respond.

184
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,370
I see.

185
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:49,670
Maybe he's already gone to sleep.

186
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:53,070
He complained when I talked to him earlier.

187
00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:54,970
Here, Ashizawa.

188
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:56,870
Thank you.

189
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:58,871
But his light's on.

190
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,070
You're right.

191
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:03,270
Looks like he's doing squats.

192
00:12:03,271 --> 00:12:05,170
Come to think of it,

193
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:07,570
Urushibara said he does them every night before bed.

194
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:08,870
I see.

195
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:11,370
Oh, right. Ashizawa, can I have that curry?

196
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:13,770
What? Sure.

197
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:16,470
I'm going to take this over there.

198
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:19,070
I see. You're going to lure him out with the smell.

199
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,271
-Yes. -You can do it.

200
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:26,070
Hey, Urushibara.

201
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:28,570
Sorry for picking a fight earlier.

202
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:32,070
I know you didn't do it on purpose.

203
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:33,871
Come on, Urushibara.

204
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:36,970
I'm stuffed.

205
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:39,770
I can't eat anymore.

206
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:41,270
Of course not.

207
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:44,870
You had five heaping servings of curry.

208
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:46,471
You eat too much.

209
00:12:47,571 --> 00:12:51,370
It's no use. He's not responding.

210
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,970
He's listening to music on his headphones while doing squats.

211
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:56,671
I see.

212
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:01,270
Do you smell something burning?

213
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:02,371
What?

214
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:05,370
You're right.

215
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:07,471
Hey, look.

216
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:11,370
The tent's on fire!

217
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:13,670
Isn't that Urushibara's tent?

218
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:15,670
-No way. -Seriously?

219
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,070
Water! Everyone get water!

220
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:19,571
Hurry!

221
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:30,064
Hurry!

222
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:10,563
Urushibara...

223
00:14:10,564 --> 00:14:13,464
-No. -No way.

224
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:19,863
Hey, Ai. What happened to the man inside?

225
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:23,164
Don't! You don't want to see that.

226
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:30,563
But, Mitsuhiko,

227
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:33,363
why did the tent catch fire?

228
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:36,164
Well, because...

229
00:14:37,564 --> 00:14:41,964
Maybe the person in the tent next door saw something.

230
00:14:42,764 --> 00:14:44,863
Excuse me!

231
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:46,563
Are you awake?

232
00:14:46,564 --> 00:14:48,363
Hello?

233
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:49,763
Can you hear us?

234
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,363
Excuse me!

235
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:53,563
-Is anyone home? -Hello?

236
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:55,364
We're opening the flap.

237
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:03,964
Chief Kuroda?

238
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:06,163
Sorry.

239
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:09,064
I was sleeping with earplugs in.

240
00:15:10,264 --> 00:15:13,064
But I can tell at a glance what's happening.

241
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:17,164
Let's call the police immediately.

242
00:15:18,064 --> 00:15:19,864
Any objections?

243
00:15:21,564 --> 00:15:23,864
Rumi Wakasa?

244
00:15:35,564 --> 00:15:38,063
Ms. Wakasa...

245
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:40,064
Ms. Wakasa!

246
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:48,163
What is it, Yoshida?

247
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:51,063
That police officer with the scary face

248
00:15:51,064 --> 00:15:55,163
is asking if it's okay to call the police.

249
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:56,164
What?

250
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:59,963
Well, Rumi Wakasa?

251
00:15:59,964 --> 00:16:04,463
A tent caught fire, and a man is dead.

252
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,863
It seems natural to me that we'd call the police.

253
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:09,763
Why are you asking me?

254
00:16:09,764 --> 00:16:13,663
And how do you know my name?

255
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:17,963
You were glaring at me with such a fierce expression,

256
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:20,263
I thought you had an objection.

257
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:24,163
Because of this face, people often look away

258
00:16:24,164 --> 00:16:28,663
but they rarely stare.

259
00:16:28,664 --> 00:16:30,663
Really?

260
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:33,763
And I saw your name in the news.

261
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:37,663
"Grade school teacher Rumi Wakasa saves the day!"

262
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,863
"Subdues professional golfer!"

263
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:43,163
You saw that?

264
00:16:43,164 --> 00:16:45,064
How embarrassing.

265
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:48,563
This woman...

266
00:16:48,564 --> 00:16:50,364
Her right eye's blind.

267
00:16:53,364 --> 00:16:54,863
Come to think of it,

268
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:56,763
when Ms. Wakasa first introduced herself

269
00:16:56,764 --> 00:16:58,963
as our assistant homeroom teacher,

270
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:01,164
she hit her head on the podium.

271
00:17:02,364 --> 00:17:04,663
She hit her head on the trapdoor to the basement

272
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:07,263
in the old storage shed, too.

273
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:09,263
I was beginning to think

274
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:11,863
she was pretending to be a clumsy teacher

275
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,664
so we'd underestimate her, but...

276
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:17,264
What if hitting her head...

277
00:17:18,764 --> 00:17:21,164
wasn't an accident?

278
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:49,263
Sorry, Yuminaga.

279
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:53,263
I wasn't sure whether to call you or violent crime's Megure.

280
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:55,463
No problem, sir.

281
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:58,164
A fire is arson's job.

282
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:01,663
So, what's the situation?

283
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:06,463
The origin of the fire was the candle inside the lantern.

284
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:10,663
It melted into the other candles scattered around it,

285
00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:13,264
so it's kind of a mess.

286
00:18:14,664 --> 00:18:16,763
The candle fell,

287
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:18,863
igniting comic books and clothing.

288
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,163
The fire spread quickly.

289
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:25,163
Then it enveloped the victim sleeping in the legless chair,

290
00:18:25,164 --> 00:18:27,963
burning everything.

291
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:32,863
It seems the victim had quite a bit to drink.

292
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:38,063
The tent entrance was zipped shut all the way.

293
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:41,663
It even had a lock on it.

294
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:44,263
So it wasn't arson.

295
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:47,163
No. I believe it was an accident.

296
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:50,463
Isn't it strange, though?

297
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,063
See? There's a single strip of bamboo

298
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:55,364
mixed in with the melted candle.

299
00:18:57,064 --> 00:19:01,963
Yes. That's probably one of the skewers

300
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:04,564
from the dango the victim was eating.

301
00:19:05,564 --> 00:19:09,663
I didn't realize you were here, Conan.

302
00:19:09,664 --> 00:19:13,763
You're familiar with the Sleeping Kogoro's adviser?

303
00:19:13,764 --> 00:19:17,663
Yes. He's advised me before.

304
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:22,363
Also, if you look closely at the hardened candles,

305
00:19:22,364 --> 00:19:26,463
there's one with a hole near the tip,

306
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:29,763
and for some reason there's a V shaped burn

307
00:19:29,764 --> 00:19:33,163
on the cover of the magazine next to the laptop.

308
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:36,863
Maybe someone set some kind of mechanism.

309
00:19:36,864 --> 00:19:38,363
I see.

310
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:39,763
You're right.

311
00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:46,064
Which means that person is one of you three...

312
00:19:47,464 --> 00:19:50,864
who visited his tent one at a time.

313
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:02,363
The first to visit his tent...

314
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:05,664
was Midori Furuoka.

315
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,063
Next was Sumito Ashizawa.

316
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:14,563
And finally Kuninori Danno, correct?

317
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:16,563
Oh, my.

318
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:18,163
Earlier, you said you were sleeping

319
00:20:18,164 --> 00:20:22,463
inside your tent with earplugs in.

320
00:20:22,464 --> 00:20:26,063
But you know the order in which they visited?

321
00:20:26,064 --> 00:20:29,463
No. Actually, while nodding off,

322
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:33,763
I was watching through a gap in my tent flap

323
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:37,463
as you cheerfully ate your curry.

324
00:20:37,464 --> 00:20:41,763
Was there someone who caught your interest?

325
00:20:41,764 --> 00:20:45,363
No. I had no particular reason for doing it.

326
00:20:45,364 --> 00:20:48,364
No particular reason?

327
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:51,163
Yes.

328
00:20:51,164 --> 00:20:56,163
Since my tent was right next to the tent that burned,

329
00:20:56,164 --> 00:21:00,863
I remembered the faces and order of the people who came this way.

330
00:21:00,864 --> 00:21:03,663
But since I had earplugs in,

331
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:07,863
I don't know what the three of them

332
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:09,364
discussed with the victim.

333
00:21:11,264 --> 00:21:12,963
And then...

334
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:16,164
you went to sleep?

335
00:21:18,864 --> 00:21:22,963
Surely, you didn't ignore the tent engulfed in flames

336
00:21:22,964 --> 00:21:29,464
so you could observe the person you're so interested in, right?

337
00:21:30,564 --> 00:21:31,763
No.

338
00:21:31,764 --> 00:21:34,963
I made the mistake of falling asleep.

339
00:21:34,964 --> 00:21:37,763
Though since there was a grade school teacher present,

340
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,063
I may have underestimated the situation

341
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,663
and believed nothing serious would occur.

342
00:21:42,664 --> 00:21:45,063
I see.

343
00:21:45,064 --> 00:21:48,463
Is she a teacher?

344
00:21:48,464 --> 00:21:49,963
Yes.

345
00:21:49,964 --> 00:21:52,664
She's our assistant homeroom teacher.

346
00:21:57,264 --> 00:22:03,163
So why don't we ask you one by one again?

347
00:22:03,164 --> 00:22:08,964
What did you discuss with the victim then?

348
00:22:10,164 --> 00:22:14,263
Let's start with Midori Furuoka

349
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:17,263
who visited the victim's tent first.

350
00:22:17,264 --> 00:22:18,664
All right.

351
00:23:42,564 --> 00:23:46,163
"Next Episode" -Why did the victim, Urushibara

352
00:23:46,164 --> 00:23:49,963
stay in his tent instead of eating curry with everyone else?

353
00:23:49,964 --> 00:23:53,063
We got into an argument.

354
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,363
Hey.

355
00:23:54,364 --> 00:23:57,263
Danno claimed he used to be the ace of his basketball team.

356
00:23:57,264 --> 00:24:00,063
-Is that true? -Yes, he was.

357
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,563
Look.

358
00:24:01,564 --> 00:24:03,464
A balancing acorn.

359
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:12,564
