1
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:06,475
This is delicious.

2
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:11,575
Drinking beer in day time is exceptionally fantastic.

3
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:18,148
Are you Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

4
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:20,348
You want my autograph? Sure.

5
00:00:20,348 --> 00:00:23,648
No, there's a call for you, Mr. Mouri.

6
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,448
Oh, thank you.

7
00:00:25,448 --> 00:00:27,148
Yes, hello?

8
00:00:27,148 --> 00:00:30,548
Hey there, famed detective. Long time no see.

9
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:32,848
Who are you?

10
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:35,148
How sad that you should forget me.

11
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:37,648
It's me. I'm Mr. Reiji Himuro.

12
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:39,848
Himuro?

13
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:43,048
Don't tell me that you're that Himuro.

14
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:45,048
Hey, you. Just what do you think you're doing?

15
00:00:46,248 --> 00:00:48,048
It's so nice

16
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,448
to be with your children, so peaceful.

17
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:52,248
What do you want?

18
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:56,948
Thanks to you, somebody's going to die.

19
00:00:56,948 --> 00:00:58,548
What?

20
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:13,548
Oh, no.

21
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:16,948
Aim for a 100% solution.

22
00:01:16,948 --> 00:01:19,348
Clear all mysteries and codes.

23
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:21,248
A trap that was rigged with a weird alibi.

24
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,448
Kogoro Mouri is in dire straits.

25
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:24,948
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:26,948
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:26,948 --> 00:01:29,248
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:12,173
"The Famed Detective is Framed".

29
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:22,873
Pops, over there!

30
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:26,073
Darn! Don't you dare move from there, Himuro!

31
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:27,073
Dad!

32
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,173
Excuse me, miss. Your bill.

33
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:43,073
"Reiji Himuro (40)" -I was looking outside

34
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:45,773
"Previously a bank robber" -when I happened to see you.

35
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:47,973
I felt nostalgic that I decided to call you.

36
00:03:47,973 --> 00:03:49,273
Cut out the joke!

37
00:03:49,273 --> 00:03:51,273
What was that call a while ago about?

38
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,373
Where and who's going to die?

39
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:56,273
If that's what you're concerned about, it's already too late.

40
00:03:56,273 --> 00:03:59,073
What? What do you mean?

41
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,473
Dad, no!

42
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:04,373
-Hey, isn't that Kogoro Mouri? -Why you, what are you up to?

43
00:04:10,673 --> 00:04:13,373
Darn! So, this is what he wants.

44
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:18,173
The victim is Mr. Shingo Numao, age 35.

45
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:19,573
He's an auto mechanic,

46
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:22,273
working at an auto repair factory called Taiyo Motors in 3-Beika-cho.

47
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:24,073
He died of an impact throughout his entire body

48
00:04:24,073 --> 00:04:25,873
and virtually died on the spot.

49
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:30,173
-He fell from there? -Yes.

50
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:31,673
How about it, Chiba?

51
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:33,173
No mistake about it.

52
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,573
He fell from here.

53
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:38,173
The railing is corroded and part of it is missing.

54
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:41,473
But, there are no signs of a struggle.

55
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:42,673
I see.

56
00:04:43,973 --> 00:04:45,973
"Morgue"

57
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:48,273
"Shingo Numao (35), Previously a bank robber" -Numao.

58
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:50,573
Is it you?

59
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:52,973
Do you know him, Dad?

60
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:54,373
Yeah.

61
00:04:54,373 --> 00:04:58,973
I arrested that guy Himuro after getting info from Numao.

62
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:00,873
Reiji Himuro.

63
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:05,573
He was a notorious bank robber.

64
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:08,173
I see. If I remember correctly, Numao was...

65
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:09,773
Yes.

66
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:12,973
He used to be Himuro's accomplice, rather his henchman.

67
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:15,573
He was virtually a dogsbody.

68
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:17,873
He listened to my advice telling him

69
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:23,573
to quit being a yes man for such a scum.

70
00:05:25,873 --> 00:05:29,473
Numao, I'm sure you can start over.

71
00:05:29,473 --> 00:05:30,673
Believe me

72
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:33,273
and tell me what you know about Himuro.

73
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:35,673
I think that's right.

74
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:40,773
It's a bummer being used by that scum forever, right?

75
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:45,173
It doesn't worth to be made an accomplice of a homicide because of him.

76
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:46,473
Homicide?

77
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:48,073
No.

78
00:05:48,073 --> 00:05:49,573
I just thought that if I continued doing what I'm doing now,

79
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:52,373
I'd eventually turn out that way.

80
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:57,373
So, where's Himuro now?

81
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:58,973
In the interrogation room.

82
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:01,673
Officer Sato is hearing him out now.

83
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:07,273
He used to be an easy mark, who fell for anything from before.

84
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:10,573
Therefore, he got away with probation,

85
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:14,773
while I was jailed for ages.

86
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:16,873
It's good to know that that he's not around anymore.

87
00:06:16,873 --> 00:06:18,273
Cut it out!

88
00:06:18,273 --> 00:06:20,073
Weren't you the one who did it?

89
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:22,173
According to Mr. Mouri...

90
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,273
How?

91
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:27,673
So, when did Numao die?

92
00:06:27,673 --> 00:06:29,573
At about 3:40 PM.

93
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:32,273
3:40 PM?

94
00:06:32,273 --> 00:06:35,673
If I remember correctly at that time, I was at Hokubu Department Store

95
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:39,673
and grabbed by the collar by a certain famous detective.

96
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:43,773
Then, embarrassed him in front of the public.

97
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:45,373
Just as would be expected of a famed detective.

98
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:48,173
He's really reliable.

99
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:50,173
I'm counting on you to testify my alibi.

100
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:56,173
If so, how'd you know that he was going to die?

101
00:06:56,173 --> 00:06:58,373
I guess you can call it telepathy.

102
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:00,173
Darn!

103
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:02,073
-Wait. -Mr. Mouri!

104
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:04,873
Himuro! How dare you!

105
00:07:04,873 --> 00:07:06,173
Mr. Mouri!

106
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:07,873
I'll bet you killed him beforehand

107
00:07:07,873 --> 00:07:10,173
and set him up to somehow fall to his death. Isn't that right?

108
00:07:10,173 --> 00:07:12,473
No, Mr. Mouri!

109
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:17,073
You... What right do you have to grab me by my collar?

110
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:18,073
What?

111
00:07:18,073 --> 00:07:19,673
Mr. Mouri!

112
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:23,273
Hey, let me go, will you?

113
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:26,373
Enough, Mr. Mouri.

114
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:28,373
But Inspector...

115
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:30,273
Well then,

116
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:35,373
since this voluntary interrogation's over without hassle,

117
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:37,673
I guess I'll leave now.

118
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,973
"A Famed Detective Disgraces Himself"

119
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:57,073
"Detective Goes On A Rampage In Broad Daylight!"

120
00:07:58,073 --> 00:07:59,073
"The Eyes Of A Lunatic"

121
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:12,273
What's this about the websites flooded with comments?

122
00:08:12,273 --> 00:08:13,473
I don't care about it!

123
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:21,373
I'm an incompetent, fumbling detective!

124
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:24,373
What do you mean, Inspector?

125
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:28,073
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, Mouri!

126
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:30,973
On what charges are we supposed to arrest him on?

127
00:08:30,973 --> 00:08:32,673
That's...

128
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:34,173
Futhermore,

129
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:38,473
you publicly assaulted a person who's not even a suspect

130
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:40,573
and tried to charge him.

131
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:41,673
If things came to worse,

132
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:45,073
we have to arrest you, understand?

133
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:48,273
You mean you feel that way too, Inspector?

134
00:08:48,273 --> 00:08:50,273
I don't feel that way.

135
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:52,973
Still, that's how society sees it.

136
00:08:52,973 --> 00:08:55,373
He provoked you. You fell for it

137
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:57,373
and now you've lost your control.

138
00:08:57,373 --> 00:08:59,273
Take time off for a while.

139
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:09,473
Dad.

140
00:09:09,473 --> 00:09:11,973
I understand how you feel, but you're drinking too much.

141
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:21,073
There. That's the cafe where we were at.

142
00:09:21,073 --> 00:09:23,873
It's much too far to find it coincidentally.

143
00:09:25,573 --> 00:09:27,073
No doubt about it.

144
00:09:27,073 --> 00:09:30,273
He was on his guard, watching for Pops from way before that.

145
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:34,173
Conan?

146
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,273
Where's Mr. Mouri?

147
00:09:35,273 --> 00:09:37,673
He said that he had to go check somewhere else,

148
00:09:37,673 --> 00:09:40,573
so he told me to tell you to check on this side.

149
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:41,973
I see.

150
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:43,973
I'm relieved to hear that.

151
00:09:43,973 --> 00:09:47,973
I was worried because the media was really bashing him.

152
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:49,473
He's fine.

153
00:09:49,473 --> 00:09:52,673
He's all out to clear his name.

154
00:09:52,673 --> 00:09:55,473
By the way, will everything be okay on your side, Officer Takagi?

155
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:57,773
Cooperating with Pops.

156
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:02,173
Yeah. After all, Mr. Mouri's always helping us out.

157
00:10:02,173 --> 00:10:03,873
So, doing this much is nothing.

158
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:10,473
Around here?

159
00:10:10,473 --> 00:10:12,273
Yes.

160
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:14,873
A little more before would be better.

161
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:17,073
-Before? -Before, I see.

162
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:20,973
Right there.

163
00:10:20,973 --> 00:10:22,773
Can you show me from a little before that?

164
00:10:30,073 --> 00:10:32,873
Hey, can we look at the floor below here?

165
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:33,973
Yeah.

166
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:38,073
Around here?

167
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,673
It's Himuro.

168
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:47,973
-What lies beyond that? -It's the men's restroom.

169
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:51,773
He's coming back.

170
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:53,673
Hey, what's that?

171
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:56,073
The one to the right edge of the screen.

172
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:59,173
Oh, that? Probably a microphone.

173
00:10:59,173 --> 00:11:02,773
They had a public radio recording there last night.

174
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:06,073
Over here?

175
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:08,573
I heard they're having a recording today too.

176
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:11,573
Yeah, but it doesn't look as if Himuro came here

177
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:14,673
because he had something to do.

178
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,173
Officer Takagi.

179
00:11:16,173 --> 00:11:19,273
There's one more thing he asked me to ask you to check on.

180
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:20,573
One more thing?

181
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:25,473
Thank you for waiting.

182
00:11:25,473 --> 00:11:27,573
I'm officer Eguchi from the Beika police station.

183
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:28,673
Good work.

184
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:30,273
And...

185
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,373
Conan?

186
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:36,573
Pops Kogoro told me to ask you again.

187
00:11:36,573 --> 00:11:37,773
About what?

188
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:40,573
Why'd you come here to begin with?

189
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:45,573
The fact is, I got word while I was on patrol.

190
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:48,973
That a suspicious person was inside this building.

191
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:51,073
This building is under destruction

192
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:53,573
because there's danger of it coming down.

193
00:11:53,573 --> 00:11:55,973
So, I rushed over here and found...

194
00:11:57,673 --> 00:12:00,473
Hey, you! Watch out!

195
00:12:00,473 --> 00:12:01,673
Gosh.

196
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:10,573
Who gave out this info?

197
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:13,273
It seems he didn't say his name.

198
00:12:13,273 --> 00:12:15,673
And when his number was re-dialed, there was no answer.

199
00:12:15,673 --> 00:12:18,573
I thought that it may be a prank.

200
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:21,173
The call is recorded, right?

201
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,473
So that maybe a voice check can be carried out?

202
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:26,373
I see! Maybe it was Himuro.

203
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:29,573
I'll contact the command and control center, as well as the forensics.

204
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:34,973
I wonder why Mr. Numao came to a place like this.

205
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:38,773
-You didn't see anyone else, did you? -No.

206
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:40,673
Yes, Takagi here.

207
00:12:40,673 --> 00:12:44,173
There's something I want you to confirm for me.

208
00:12:44,173 --> 00:12:45,773
Yes, that's right.

209
00:12:45,773 --> 00:12:47,273
What I want you to confirm is

210
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:52,373
about a call from an informant that came in yesterday at around 13:30.

211
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:55,073
-A phone call! -A phone call?

212
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:58,073
Yes, I just remember it.

213
00:12:58,073 --> 00:13:01,973
It did seem like he was talking to someone on the cell phone.

214
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:03,473
Strange.

215
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:06,673
Mr. Numao who fell didn't have a cell phone,

216
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:09,073
and there was none near the corpse either.

217
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:11,573
Maybe he disposed it before he fell.

218
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:15,673
Maybe he had some incoming call history that he didn't want anybody to see.

219
00:13:15,673 --> 00:13:18,773
Okay. Let's expand the area of search and look for it.

220
00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:19,773
Yes, sir.

221
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,773
It's all rusty.

222
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:40,873
That was close!

223
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,973
This is...

224
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:49,573
I get it.

225
00:13:49,573 --> 00:13:51,073
That's how it is.

226
00:13:51,073 --> 00:13:53,273
I found it! I found it!

227
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:55,973
I found it on the ground over here!

228
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:10,462
Even if we were able to get Mr. Numao's fingerprints from this cell phone,

229
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:12,562
being thrown over to such a distance,

230
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:15,862
it's questionable whether the data is left undamaged.

231
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:16,862
Right.

232
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:19,262
Just now Pops called to say

233
00:14:19,262 --> 00:14:24,062
to check closer to the part where the railing broke off.

234
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:25,362
Okay!

235
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:28,362
Wait a second.

236
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:30,262
Himuro, back then...

237
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,762
If so, maybe he put it there.

238
00:14:35,662 --> 00:14:36,862
Conan?

239
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:31,662
Found it!

240
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:37,462
Attention to all customers.

241
00:15:37,462 --> 00:15:38,662
We will be having the public radio recording...

242
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:41,562
But the possibility of the incoming and outgoing calls history

243
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:43,962
being damaged are high.

244
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:45,862
Isn't there any other evidence?

245
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,762
It will be held on the second-floor event square of this store.

246
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:49,262
I repeat.

247
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:51,962
We will be having the public radio recording of Gogoraji

248
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:54,662
-that we also had yesterday. -Okay, when I give you the signal,

249
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,362
please applaud!

250
00:15:57,362 --> 00:15:58,862
Maybe...

251
00:16:09,962 --> 00:16:12,162
Yes, Megure here.

252
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:15,362
Hello, Inspector. This is Mouri.

253
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:18,062
I have a favor to ask you.

254
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:22,062
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Dad. You have a call from Inspector Megure.

255
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:25,362
Hello.

256
00:16:25,362 --> 00:16:27,462
What can I do for you, Inspector?

257
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:31,262
Himuro?

258
00:16:31,262 --> 00:16:34,162
Calling me out like this without a warrant.

259
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:36,362
Are you the one who did this?

260
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,462
No. I...

261
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:40,562
What is the meaning of this, Inspector?

262
00:16:40,562 --> 00:16:42,762
What are you talking about?

263
00:16:42,762 --> 00:16:45,262
You asked me to bring him in

264
00:16:45,262 --> 00:16:47,062
because you'd prove the crime he committed.

265
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:50,762
-Mouri? -Dad!

266
00:16:51,962 --> 00:16:55,062
So, this is the famous Sleeping Kogoro.

267
00:16:57,062 --> 00:16:58,862
Let me start from the conclusion.

268
00:16:58,862 --> 00:17:02,362
He used the cell phone to manipulate Shingo Numao,

269
00:17:02,362 --> 00:17:05,562
and made him fall to his death from the emergency stairs.

270
00:17:06,762 --> 00:17:09,562
Can you conclude that it wasn't an accident?

271
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,262
Yes, of course.

272
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:13,962
The emergency stairs of this building,

273
00:17:13,962 --> 00:17:17,962
partway to the 4th floor has a large hole.

274
00:17:17,962 --> 00:17:19,762
If you try to step over it,

275
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:23,062
your hand would naturally grab the railing on the left side.

276
00:17:23,062 --> 00:17:27,462
However, if that railing were to be corroded and frail...

277
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:34,262
Here's a hole in your unfounded accusation.

278
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:37,062
Is it my fault that the railing was rusted?

279
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:38,962
Right, it's your fault.

280
00:17:38,962 --> 00:17:40,162
What?

281
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:42,762
Officer Chiba, please explain it to him.

282
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,162
Yes, sir.

283
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:47,862
A corrosive agent was painted on the railing.

284
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:49,262
According to forensics,

285
00:17:49,262 --> 00:17:51,062
if left as is for a week,

286
00:17:51,062 --> 00:17:53,662
the railing should shatter to pieces.

287
00:17:53,662 --> 00:17:57,762
Moreover, you mentally cornered Numao.

288
00:17:57,762 --> 00:17:59,162
Officer Takagi.

289
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,762
Okay.

290
00:18:00,762 --> 00:18:03,862
When Mr. Himuro was arrested previously,

291
00:18:03,862 --> 00:18:07,162
there was one case that couldn't be proven.

292
00:18:07,162 --> 00:18:08,862
It was the case of two robbers broke into

293
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:11,562
a cooperative bank in Beika 2 chome.

294
00:18:11,562 --> 00:18:14,162
One of the security guards was killed.

295
00:18:14,162 --> 00:18:15,462
Hey, hey.

296
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:19,262
Stop making it sound like I'm the culprit to everything that happened.

297
00:18:19,262 --> 00:18:21,662
The two robbers who broke in back then

298
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:24,262
were Numao and you, weren't you?

299
00:18:24,262 --> 00:18:27,162
You called Numao over to this building

300
00:18:27,162 --> 00:18:30,662
and called him to tell that the murder of the security guard was exposed.

301
00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:32,962
And what if a police officer came to the scene

302
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:34,262
and then shouting something out loud?

303
00:18:34,262 --> 00:18:37,662
-Hey, you! Watch out! -I'm sure Numao panicked.

304
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:47,662
Numao's cell phone

305
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:50,462
and the cell phone you disposed in the toilet tank at the department store

306
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,262
were already retrieved.

307
00:18:53,562 --> 00:18:55,662
If we check the incoming and outgoing calls history,

308
00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:57,962
we can prove that you committed the crime.

309
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:01,262
Yes, this is Sato.

310
00:19:01,262 --> 00:19:04,262
Yes. Yes, sir.

311
00:19:04,262 --> 00:19:06,362
Is that right?

312
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:07,962
It didn't work out.

313
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:10,562
The data of both cell phones were damaged,

314
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:12,862
and it seems they can't confirm the incoming and outgoing calls history.

315
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:14,162
What about the voiceprint of the person

316
00:19:14,162 --> 00:19:16,162
who called to inform that Numao was in the building?

317
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:19,062
It was changed mechanically.

318
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:23,162
Good work.

319
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,562
Great entertainment indeed.

320
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:29,762
I see. Your story falls right into place,

321
00:19:29,762 --> 00:19:32,662
but with no proof what so ever,

322
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:34,962
you can't indict me, can you?

323
00:19:34,962 --> 00:19:36,362
Hey, Inspector.

324
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:37,462
I think you should educate

325
00:19:37,462 --> 00:19:41,562
that incompetent, fumbling detective of yours.

326
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:43,662
See you then.

327
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:46,662
-Dad. -What now, Mouri?

328
00:19:46,662 --> 00:19:48,662
It's not over yet.

329
00:19:51,662 --> 00:19:53,262
We are changing the schedule of today's Gogoraji

330
00:19:53,262 --> 00:19:57,962
to the live broadcast of the famed Sleeping Kogoro.

331
00:19:57,962 --> 00:20:00,262
He will be presenting his deductions

332
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:01,862
in order to clear his name.

333
00:20:01,862 --> 00:20:04,762
What took you so long?

334
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:06,262
Let's start then.

335
00:20:06,262 --> 00:20:08,362
At about 3:40 pm yesterday,

336
00:20:08,362 --> 00:20:10,362
what were you doing?

337
00:20:10,362 --> 00:20:12,462
I was at the Hokubu Department Store

338
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,062
preparing for the public radio recording.

339
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:16,562
I see.

340
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:18,062
Then, will you please let us hear

341
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:22,662
the recording you played for the child I sent over once again?

342
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:23,862
Yes, sir.

343
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:26,262
Mr. Takahashi, will you play it for us?

344
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:29,962
Test, test.

345
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,862
Mic test. Do you hear me?

346
00:20:32,862 --> 00:20:35,262
-Tanaka, is everything okay? -Yes, sir.

347
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:36,962
What about the microphone in the rear?

348
00:20:36,962 --> 00:20:39,362
Yes. It's perfect.

349
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:41,962
We can't hear anything, can we?

350
00:20:41,962 --> 00:20:45,062
Well then, please mute the noise from the crowd in the background.

351
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:46,062
Got it.

352
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:48,462
Test, test.

353
00:20:48,462 --> 00:20:51,062
Mic test. Do you hear me?

354
00:20:52,662 --> 00:20:54,162
The police officer is after you.

355
00:20:54,162 --> 00:20:55,662
They are right in front of that building now.

356
00:20:55,662 --> 00:20:57,162
Tanaka, is everything okay?

357
00:20:57,162 --> 00:20:58,562
Hurry up, Numao.

358
00:20:58,562 --> 00:20:59,562
Yes, sir.

359
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:01,562
Hide on the roof!

360
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:03,062
What about the microphone in the rear?

361
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:05,462
Next time you're caught, you'll be sent to prison.

362
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:08,362
No, you'll be sentenced to death.

363
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:11,162
See you, traitor.

364
00:21:15,462 --> 00:21:17,862
Darn! How dare you make a joke out of me?

365
00:21:21,662 --> 00:21:23,362
You amateur!

366
00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:26,262
What the...

367
00:21:26,262 --> 00:21:27,562
Ran?

368
00:21:28,862 --> 00:21:30,362
You scum!

369
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:38,962
Afterwards, Himura confessed to the murder he committed this time

370
00:21:38,962 --> 00:21:41,662
and the previous accounts of his crime too.

371
00:21:41,662 --> 00:21:44,962
Pops's name was successfully cleared.

372
00:23:05,562 --> 00:23:07,462
"Mouri Detective Agency"

373
00:23:12,262 --> 00:23:15,162
Come on, Dad.

374
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:18,562
I was about to throw a celebratory party and yet,

375
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:22,662
you've got the nerve to toast all by yourself.

376
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:24,262
Well, who cares?

377
00:23:24,262 --> 00:23:26,062
Let's do it, just two of us, then?

378
00:23:26,062 --> 00:23:27,262
Yes.

379
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:31,062
-To the famed detective. -To the famed detective.

380
00:23:31,062 --> 00:23:33,062
To the famed detective.

381
00:23:38,062 --> 00:23:39,362
-Cheers. -Cheers.

382
00:23:39,362 --> 00:23:41,062
Cheers!

383
00:23:42,562 --> 00:23:45,662
"Next Episode" -What a dangerous thing to do in a place like that.

384
00:23:46,562 --> 00:23:47,762
He's been pushed off!

385
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:49,962
He didn't commit suicide.

386
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,262
It's not an accident either.

387
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:54,562
Somebody pushed him off the roof.

388
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:56,162
Wait.

389
00:23:56,162 --> 00:23:59,262
We saw the man being pushed off.

390
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:00,262
That's right.

391
00:24:00,262 --> 00:24:02,162
At 2:00 pm sharp.

392
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:03,262
Yeah.

393
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:07,162
In other words, it was a long fall that took 10 minutes to hit the ground.

394
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:08,662
Next Conan,

395
00:24:08,662 --> 00:24:10,862
"The Man Who Fell Slowly".

396
00:24:28,362 --> 00:24:30,762
Next Conan's Hint:

397
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:32,562
"Veranda".

398
00:24:32,562 --> 00:24:34,162
There's no case that I cannot solve!

399
00:24:34,162 --> 00:24:35,462
It's already midnight.

400
00:24:35,462 --> 00:24:37,462
Is this supposed to be a case too?
