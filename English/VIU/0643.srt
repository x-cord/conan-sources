1
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:03,708
It's still early in the year and yet I caught a cold.

2
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:06,408
Geez, talk about bad luck.

3
00:00:06,408 --> 00:00:10,708
We had made plans to play karuta cards at Ayumi's place,

4
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:12,508
when a boy named Masao,

5
00:00:12,508 --> 00:00:17,308
who's living on the same floor in Room 2806,

6
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:21,208
and his parents interrupted us.

7
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:24,008
After seeing these three via the video call,

8
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:26,908
I saw through the fact that they weren't his real parents.

9
00:00:26,908 --> 00:00:29,108
And urged Mitsuhiko and the others

10
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:30,508
to contact the police before ending the call.

11
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,208
Although Conan said so,

12
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,708
is that really the case?

13
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,308
In order to confirm it,

14
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:41,408
we had no choice but to barge into that family.

15
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:45,608
Our excuse was to play karuta cards with Masao.

16
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:48,908
However, even though he bragged about being good at grabbing karuta cards,

17
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:51,508
he couldn't grab any.

18
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:53,708
He finally grabbed his first card marked with "ni",

19
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:56,108
but got into a tug of war with Genta,

20
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:57,908
and insisted that "a hated child thrives better in the world"

21
00:00:57,908 --> 00:01:00,808
was his card. How bizarre if that?

22
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:02,008
Wrong.

23
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:04,208
He was trying to use the karuta cards

24
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,708
to tell us something.

25
00:01:08,108 --> 00:01:09,908
What might that be?

26
00:01:30,408 --> 00:01:32,408
If all cases were men,

27
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:34,308
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

28
00:01:34,308 --> 00:01:35,808
A message in the nick of time.

29
00:01:35,808 --> 00:01:37,808
The truth that the karuta cards relay.

30
00:01:37,808 --> 00:01:39,408
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:39,408 --> 00:01:41,208
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,408
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:12,268
"Grabbing Karuta Cards in Dire Straits (Part 2)"

34
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:18,268
Now, on to the next one.

35
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:19,968
Different as chalk and cheese.

36
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,668
To hide your head but not your rear.

37
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:26,468
There.

38
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:29,568
-Ogre with an iron club. -Got it.

39
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:30,668
Next one...

40
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,568
Heaven knows and earth knows.

41
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:40,268
A lie which happened to come true.

42
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:41,368
This is it.

43
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:44,568
Only five cards left.

44
00:03:44,568 --> 00:03:46,468
Let's move on.

45
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:48,068
Better dumplings than cherry blossoms.

46
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:50,168
Got it.

47
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:51,768
My seventh card.

48
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:55,868
There are only four cards left,

49
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,268
and since you only have four cards.

50
00:03:58,268 --> 00:04:01,068
It means you can't beat me.

51
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:05,068
No, if Masao manages to take all four of the remaining cards,

52
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:06,668
he'd turn the tables and win.

53
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:11,468
Mommy, restroom.

54
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:15,468
The game is about to end, so just hold it.

55
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:18,968
Restroom. Can't hold it.

56
00:04:21,368 --> 00:04:22,968
It can't be helped.

57
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:26,568
Fine, I'll go with you, okay?

58
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:30,968
Masao, you can't go to the restroom on your own?

59
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:33,968
Yes, my child has claustrophobia,

60
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:35,468
so he needs me by his side.

61
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:36,868
Say...

62
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:38,368
Take out that towel.

63
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:39,368
What?

64
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:41,668
The towel with a horsehair crab from Lake Suwa.

65
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:43,868
I can't do without it.

66
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:50,568
Geez, stop saying selfish things.

67
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:54,968
Well, let's get going.

68
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:00,768
What do you think about that mother and child?

69
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,768
I think they're really related.

70
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:05,868
Because he said "Mommy, restroom" like a spoiled child.

71
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:09,268
You wouldn't call a bad person "Mommy", after all.

72
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:12,968
It could also be that he was forced to call her that.

73
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:15,768
I do think it's unusual

74
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:17,768
for that mother stick around Masao non-stop.

75
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:21,168
Yes, as if she's monitoring his every move

76
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:23,368
so that he can't try anything funny.

77
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:24,968
So, were they indeed...

78
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:29,168
The key to support or reject that theory is what Masao had...

79
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:31,568
The "ru", "ko", "ni", "te"...

80
00:05:31,568 --> 00:05:34,168
These four cards might be our key.

81
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,868
But what on earth does its mean?

82
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:41,068
Maybe we should rearrange these to form a word.

83
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:42,968
I don't think we should.

84
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,668
The first card he took was "ni",

85
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:48,668
but he deliberately placed it so that it's the third card from the top.

86
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:51,368
Then, you mean this is the correct order?

87
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:52,768
Yeah, I think.

88
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,068
His attempt to go to the restroom,

89
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:56,668
as well as to evacuate the mother from here,

90
00:05:56,668 --> 00:05:58,368
could've been an attempt to buy us time

91
00:05:58,368 --> 00:06:02,368
in order to solve this code.

92
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:04,468
But I don't understand its meaning.

93
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:08,468
If we read it backwards, won't work either.

94
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:12,268
And to begin with, even if the mother and father are fake,

95
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:13,468
I can't figure out the reason

96
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:16,268
why they'd be staying here acting as his parents.

97
00:06:16,268 --> 00:06:17,368
If they're kidnappers,

98
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:20,868
they should've already moved to another place.

99
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:22,068
If they're robbers,

100
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:25,968
they would've pretended no one's home and not let us in.

101
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,668
In that case,

102
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:30,068
let's call Conan and ask him about this.

103
00:06:30,068 --> 00:06:32,768
If we do that, wouldn't we be able to know the truth?

104
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,168
But, Conan...

105
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:36,368
I bet he's asleep because of his cold.

106
00:06:36,368 --> 00:06:39,268
However, if that mother is really a fake,

107
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:40,668
wouldn't it be dangerous?

108
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,568
We have no choice.

109
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,768
In that case, let's text him.

110
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:48,068
If he still has the strength to get up

111
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:50,668
and read my text he'll reply soon.

112
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:53,168
And if he doesn't, it means he's still asleep.

113
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:55,168
What are you going to write in your email?

114
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:58,368
The sequence of events leading to our visit to Masao's place.

115
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:01,068
I don't know why, but...

116
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:04,868
Edogawa suspected that those three people weren't biologically related,

117
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:06,968
just by watching the video call.

118
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,868
And he told us to call the police.

119
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:16,868
But we had doubts about that deduction,

120
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:18,968
so we asked the neighbors of Masao.

121
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:21,868
The lady in Room 2807 said

122
00:07:21,868 --> 00:07:24,668
Masao's family just moved in

123
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:28,068
and that she hasn't met his parents, right?

124
00:07:28,068 --> 00:07:31,868
She did say that she knew the previous resident of this room.

125
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,168
Yes, formerly employed by the Isobe Corporation,

126
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:37,068
which is now under suspicion of tax evasion.

127
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:40,168
And the name was Mr. Uemura.

128
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,968
The man from Room 2805 also said

129
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:46,468
he'd never seen Masao's parents.

130
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:47,468
Come to think of it,

131
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:50,968
he also said that he saw Producer Hida from Nichiuri TV

132
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:52,868
about two weeks ago.

133
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:55,568
He saw the producer going into Room 2806.

134
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:59,968
But, that producer later had a traffic accident

135
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:03,068
and was in critical condition until yesterday.

136
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:06,768
The matching statements of the two neighbors were...

137
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:09,168
that Masao is a prankster

138
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:12,468
and a big liar on top of that.

139
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:16,468
As such, we came to Masao's place to ascertain the truth,

140
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:19,768
using playing karuta cards as an excuse to get inside.

141
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:25,768
Then Masao left us the four cards he took "ru, ko, ni, te",

142
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:27,868
while going to the restroom with the mother,

143
00:08:27,868 --> 00:08:29,968
and here we are now.

144
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,968
Shouldn't we write about the towel as well?

145
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:34,068
If I recall,

146
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,068
he said, "I can't go to the restroom

147
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:38,768
without the towel with a horsehair crab from Lake Suwa on it".

148
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,068
That's right.

149
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:42,468
Sending.

150
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:43,468
"Sending"

151
00:08:43,468 --> 00:08:45,468
"Message sent"

152
00:08:45,468 --> 00:08:48,468
However, that was a very mismatched towel.

153
00:08:48,468 --> 00:08:51,668
Because you'll never find horsehair crabs in a lake.

154
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:53,068
Is that so?

155
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:56,468
Horsehair crabs only live in the sea.

156
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:58,268
"Su wa ko" (Lake Suwa),

157
00:08:58,268 --> 00:08:59,668
"ke gani" (Horsehair crab),

158
00:08:59,668 --> 00:09:00,868
"ta o ru" (towel).

159
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:07,668
I can't do without it.

160
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:11,868
I see.

161
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:14,968
So that's what he meant.

162
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:16,568
Haibara.

163
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:18,168
Don't tell me...

164
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:21,668
You already figured something out?

165
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:22,868
How'd you know?

166
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:26,368
Because you just showed the same expression as Conan.

167
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:28,568
How rude...

168
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,168
But, it's true that, I've figured it out.

169
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:35,968
That he was right all along.

170
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:42,668
Conan was right, you say?

171
00:09:42,668 --> 00:09:47,068
So the man and woman just now really are bad guys?

172
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:51,268
Yes, pretending to be Masao's real parents,

173
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:53,368
they're up to no good, don't you think?

174
00:09:53,368 --> 00:09:56,568
But, how did you figure that out?

175
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:59,168
It's the karuta cards Masao collected.

176
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:03,168
The four cards told us so.

177
00:10:06,568 --> 00:10:10,568
Which means, in order to only collect those four cards,

178
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,368
he had positioned those cards beforehand

179
00:10:12,368 --> 00:10:16,068
so that they would've been easy for him to grab.

180
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:18,468
Then he headed to the restroom

181
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:19,968
with the woman who was faking to be his mother.

182
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:22,568
It was all to help the rest of us figure it out.

183
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:27,568
The secret code he had constructed.

184
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:31,668
Well, unfortunately the first "ni" card he tried to grab.

185
00:10:31,668 --> 00:10:33,368
I was the first to take this.

186
00:10:33,368 --> 00:10:35,868
No way. I'll never let you have it.

187
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,268
Because this "ni" card is my card.

188
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:41,768
Resulted in a tug-of-war with Genta.

189
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:45,168
But what does it mean?

190
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:46,768
The four cards.

191
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:48,868
Masao told us, didn't he?

192
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:50,768
The key to solving the code.

193
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:53,068
By saying, "I can't do it without that."

194
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:56,168
So... you mean...

195
00:10:56,168 --> 00:10:58,568
The towel with the horsehair crab from Lake Suwa?

196
00:10:58,568 --> 00:11:00,968
Yes, "Su wa ko" (Lake Suwa), "ke ga ni" (horsehair crab)

197
00:11:00,968 --> 00:11:03,368
and "ta o ru" (towel) all have three syllables.

198
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:07,368
Change the middle syllable of each "wa", "ga" and "o"

199
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:09,268
into the particles "ha", "go", "wo",

200
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,168
and think along these lines.

201
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:14,068
What are "party something", anyway?

202
00:11:14,068 --> 00:11:15,968
Do you mean "party girls"?

203
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:20,368
They are words used between nouns in connective sentences

204
00:11:20,368 --> 00:11:22,768
that show relation or attach meaning.

205
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:27,368
For example, Genta "wa" otoko da (Genta "is" a boy).

206
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:29,068
I see.

207
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:32,268
"Su wa ko" should be "su is ko".

208
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:35,368
So isn't it telling us "su" is represented by "ko"?

209
00:11:35,368 --> 00:11:38,268
Then "ke ga ni" means

210
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:41,368
to treat "ke" as if it were "ni", right?

211
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,668
In that case, "ta o ru" means

212
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:46,468
"ta" is changed into "ru".

213
00:11:46,468 --> 00:11:50,068
Yes, so taking that into account,

214
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:53,868
try reading the four characters.

215
00:11:53,868 --> 00:11:55,868
Leaving the last "te",

216
00:11:55,868 --> 00:11:58,668
which doesn't fall under any of the rules, as is.

217
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:01,168
We make the first "ru" into "ta".

218
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:03,468
And the next "ko" is actually "su".

219
00:12:03,468 --> 00:12:07,468
And if we think of the third card, "ni", as "ke"...

220
00:12:12,268 --> 00:12:14,168
It means "Help"!

221
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,268
That's right.

222
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,568
Those two pretending to be Masao's real parent

223
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:21,368
are bad guys scheming who-knows-what.

224
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:25,368
So Masao is pleading to us for help.

225
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:27,068
But wait...

226
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:30,068
This isn't another lie again, is it?

227
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:31,468
He's got a point.

228
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:33,668
It's possible this could be an elaborate prank.

229
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:34,968
Fools.

230
00:12:34,968 --> 00:12:37,068
Would he have used a code like this

231
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:40,268
that he couldn't be sure we'd be able to solve as a prank?

232
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:42,468
This is a secret code made

233
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:44,968
so that the woman faking as his mother wouldn't catch on.

234
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:46,268
Plus, that child,

235
00:12:46,268 --> 00:12:50,068
when we were about to be turned away at the door,

236
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:51,668
he was frightened.

237
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:58,268
But, where could Masao's real parents be, then?

238
00:12:58,268 --> 00:13:01,168
I don't know about his father, but...

239
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:02,568
As far as his mother,

240
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:04,168
I can make a fair guess.

241
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,168
For real?

242
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:11,168
Masao, said something odd besides

243
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:13,468
"the towel of the horsehair crab from Lake Suwa", didn't he?

244
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:15,068
Something odd?

245
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:17,968
That's right, didn't he say he was good at karuta cards,

246
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:19,668
but it turned out he really suck at playing.

247
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:22,668
The reason for that was just because he had to collect

248
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,468
those four cards above all else.

249
00:13:24,468 --> 00:13:26,868
Could it be, when he was going to the restroom and said,

250
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:30,468
"Mommy, restroom" in a spoiled tone?

251
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:31,568
That was also only because

252
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:33,968
he had wanted to get that woman away from here

253
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:37,168
and have us solve the code.

254
00:13:37,168 --> 00:13:40,268
But even if he hadn't deliberately said that,

255
00:13:40,268 --> 00:13:43,268
don't you think that woman would've accompanied Masao anyway?

256
00:13:43,268 --> 00:13:45,268
That's true.

257
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:46,668
If she had let Masao leave by himself,

258
00:13:46,668 --> 00:13:49,268
he might've taken the chance and fled.

259
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:53,068
So he purposely said "Mommy, restroom"

260
00:13:53,068 --> 00:13:54,768
in order to make us connect that phrase

261
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,868
with the "help" we figured out earlier.

262
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:59,468
Connect them?

263
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:03,068
Mommy, restroom.

264
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:04,068
Help.

265
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:06,868
Could it be?

266
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:08,668
That's kid's mother...

267
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:10,768
They locked her in the restroom?

268
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,168
No way.

269
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:14,368
Although we lack solid proof,

270
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:16,468
if we think of it that way,

271
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:18,468
it'd make sense that the man faking to be his father

272
00:14:18,468 --> 00:14:21,668
has been inside the restroom this whole time.

273
00:14:21,668 --> 00:14:23,268
Then, indeed...

274
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:26,668
We should've just called Officer Takagi in the first place.

275
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:32,868
Just as that cold-ridden detective had instructed.

276
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:35,768
"Mouri Detective Agency"

277
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:37,368
You must be sweating up a storm.

278
00:14:37,368 --> 00:14:38,668
I brought a change of clothes...

279
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:41,968
Conan?

280
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:43,868
But with that fever...

281
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:45,768
Where could he have gone?

282
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:48,168
"Sorry, I'll be back soon. From Conan" -Geez.

283
00:14:54,516 --> 00:14:58,016
But then, how are you going to save her,

284
00:14:58,016 --> 00:15:00,216
the mother who is locked in the restroom?

285
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:01,916
No, before that...

286
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,216
we have to do something about that woman

287
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:05,516
who's pretending to be his mother.

288
00:15:05,516 --> 00:15:08,516
Hey, if we don't decide on a strategy soon,

289
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:10,616
they'll be back before we know it.

290
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:12,116
It'll be fine.

291
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:15,216
There's no need to rescue or capture anyone.

292
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:16,216
What?

293
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:19,516
All we need to do is to finish playing this round of karuta cards

294
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:21,916
and leave.

295
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,616
So, we won't do anything?

296
00:15:23,616 --> 00:15:25,416
However...

297
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,816
Soon after we leave, we'll call Officer Takagi

298
00:15:27,816 --> 00:15:29,316
and explain the situation.

299
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:31,216
And get him to come and save her.

300
00:15:31,216 --> 00:15:34,216
Of course, if you all wanted to show Conan

301
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:35,716
that we can handle without him,

302
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:37,316
and just the four of us make a reckless gamble,

303
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:38,716
that's another story altogether.

304
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:40,616
No, no, no, no,

305
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,216
Hey.

306
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:47,316
Whose cell phone is that?

307
00:15:52,216 --> 00:15:53,416
Wonder whose it is?

308
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,016
It's not mine.

309
00:15:55,016 --> 00:15:56,916
It's not mine, either.

310
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:00,816
Don't tell me...

311
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,816
Very keen.

312
00:16:08,816 --> 00:16:10,916
That's my cell phone.

313
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,616
I left it there while the line was still connected.

314
00:16:15,616 --> 00:16:22,116
Of course, I was on the other end of the line.

315
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:25,416
Thanks to you, now I know full well,

316
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,316
that you aren't just normal brats

317
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:30,416
but bothersome pets that can't be allowed to leave here.

318
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,716
And where is Masao?

319
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:34,516
I don't see him.

320
00:16:35,716 --> 00:16:37,216
As far that boy,

321
00:16:37,216 --> 00:16:39,216
he is keeping his mother company

322
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:42,016
as I tied him up in the restroom as well.

323
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:43,216
Well, at any rate,

324
00:16:43,216 --> 00:16:47,116
you guys will soon join them in that same restroom.

325
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,616
You, girl, with the hair band.

326
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:55,816
Tie your friends up with that sticky tape.

327
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:57,716
After all that's done,

328
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,916
I'll tie you up myself.

329
00:17:01,116 --> 00:17:03,616
Well, if you don't like that idea...

330
00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:09,616
We have other ways of rendering you immobile.

331
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:13,316
You'll be fine.

332
00:17:13,316 --> 00:17:15,516
As soon as we finish our business,

333
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:18,716
we'll leave you all alone.

334
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:21,016
If you're lucky and the real man of this household

335
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:24,816
comes back from his business trip early,

336
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:26,816
he may be able to help you.

337
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,116
My, what could it be?

338
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,916
That "business" of yours.

339
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:35,216
Well, there's no telling, is there?

340
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,916
Hey, hurry and answer it.

341
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:43,916
Yes, sure.

342
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,916
Hey, could that be...

343
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,116
Conan, right?

344
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:49,116
Hello.

345
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:50,916
I'm from the post office.

346
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:54,516
Is this Mr. Uemura from Room 2806?

347
00:17:54,516 --> 00:17:56,216
Yes, it is.

348
00:17:56,216 --> 00:17:58,616
Regarding a registered mail you sent for delivery,

349
00:17:58,616 --> 00:18:00,416
the addressee was unavailable,

350
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,716
so we were unable to deliver it.

351
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:05,516
Yes, it seems they've moved.

352
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:07,116
In that case, since this is registered mail,

353
00:18:07,116 --> 00:18:10,616
may I have your permission to directly return it to you?

354
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:12,916
Sure, I'm buzzing you up now.

355
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:17,616
So it wasn't Conan.

356
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:22,216
I thought he'd come for us after he read the email we sent.

357
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:24,916
But, I've finally figured it out

358
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:28,916
that you two are trying to destroy evidence pertaining to tax evasion.

359
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:32,216
The sender of that registered mail

360
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:34,216
was the previous resident of this apartment, the one named Uemura,

361
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:36,616
who was a former employee of the Isobe Corporation,

362
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,816
now under suspicion of tax evasion.

363
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:41,216
The contents of the registered mail

364
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:43,216
are probably whistle-blower documents,

365
00:18:43,216 --> 00:18:46,416
or account books with evidence of tax evasion.

366
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,616
It was sent approximately two weeks ago,

367
00:18:48,616 --> 00:18:50,616
in exchange for a reward,

368
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:54,116
to a producer at Nichiuri TV named Hida.

369
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:58,816
The employee planned to move from here and go into hiding.

370
00:18:58,816 --> 00:19:02,616
But that producer ended up in a car accident

371
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:05,416
and couldn't receive the registered mail due to being hospitalized.

372
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:09,816
Since the post office holds on to mail for more or less ten days.

373
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,516
You calculated the time of its return.

374
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:15,916
And plotted to pose as Uemura who had lived here before,

375
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:19,016
and snatch away that registered mail.

376
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:22,216
Then, what happened to that Mr. Uemura?

377
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:24,316
Probably confined somewhere else,

378
00:19:24,316 --> 00:19:27,716
or already murdered.

379
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:30,016
And made to look like an accident,

380
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:33,016
similar to the Nichiuri TV producer.

381
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:36,616
My, look at you, so I was right on the mark.

382
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,616
He's at the door.

383
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:46,616
Take it from him.

384
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:48,116
Sure.

385
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:55,216
Anyway, as for what we'll do with you...

386
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:59,116
I suppose we'll decide after we've checked out the registered mail.

387
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:12,616
Did something happen?

388
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:13,616
Hey.

389
00:20:24,316 --> 00:20:26,016
Hey, Conan, don't go in before me...

390
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,916
Cuff that woman, hurry.

391
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:28,916
Okay.

392
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:32,016
Conan!

393
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:39,016
Where's the woman that was here?

394
00:20:42,216 --> 00:20:44,616
I put her to sleep with my tranquilizer gun.

395
00:20:44,616 --> 00:20:47,116
And she's being handcuffed right now,

396
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:50,216
by Officer Takagi who's dressed in that mailman disguise.

397
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,516
By the way, if you're asking

398
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:55,916
why Officer Takagi is dressed like that...

399
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,316
You read the email I sent and deduced

400
00:20:58,316 --> 00:21:03,116
that they were after the returned registered mail, no?

401
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:05,916
Never mind that, how did you figure it out?

402
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,916
That those two people weren't really Masao's parents.

403
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,816
Didn't you only see them through the video call?

404
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:13,616
Yes, it's because...

405
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:15,516
when I saw their hairlines,

406
00:21:15,516 --> 00:21:18,816
I noticed only Masao has a window's peak.

407
00:21:18,816 --> 00:21:20,916
The window's peak is a dominant trait,

408
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,016
so parents without window's peaks could never have given birth to him.

409
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,916
Are you guys all right?

410
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:37,016
The bad guys have been caught, so you can relax.

411
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:41,216
I hope you learn from this

412
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,916
and don't tell pointless lies ever again.

413
00:21:46,616 --> 00:21:50,016
Yes, I'll never tell another lie as long as I live.

414
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:55,216
Could it be another lie in the same breath?

415
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:24,616
"Tax Evasion Charges" "Two days later"

416
00:23:24,616 --> 00:23:26,916
So the president was indeed arrested.

417
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:30,116
Well, since he even went as far as to hire those two

418
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:32,716
to destroy the evidence, it only stands to reason.

419
00:23:32,716 --> 00:23:34,616
And it looks like Mr. Uemura who had been confined

420
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:37,516
has also been rescued.

421
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,716
Isn't this great?

422
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:44,516
Don't tell me you guys

423
00:23:44,516 --> 00:23:49,816
all caught a cold from me, did you?

424
00:23:49,816 --> 00:23:52,116
My cold is completely gone, though.

425
00:23:54,116 --> 00:23:56,316
Everyone, take care not to catch a cold.

426
00:24:12,816 --> 00:24:14,016
Cold prevention.

427
00:24:14,016 --> 00:24:15,316
-A mask. -Washing hands

428
00:24:15,316 --> 00:24:17,516
-Gargling. -Don't give your cold to others.
