1
00:00:01,063 --> 00:00:02,363
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:02,363 --> 00:00:03,563
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:03,563 --> 00:00:05,263
And start the countdown to deduction and the future!

4
00:00:05,263 --> 00:00:07,863
Lawyer Eri Kisaki and renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri.

5
00:00:07,863 --> 00:00:09,763
The confrontation of destiny of a separated couple.

6
00:00:09,763 --> 00:00:11,163
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:12,863
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:14,863
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:55,564 --> 00:02:01,164
On our way to pick up Attorney at Law Eri Kisaki, Ran's mother,

10
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:03,164
in order to go to dinner together,

11
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:07,464
we discover the dead body of a popular wrestler, Mr. Shiro Eisaku.

12
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:09,864
From what's seen of the dead body,

13
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:12,564
it seems that he had been killed

14
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:16,364
while getting a hair cut at a barber or a beauty shop.

15
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:18,464
It turns out that Ms. Minayo Hasaka.

16
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:20,364
"Minayo Hasaka (29)" -who runs a beauty salon in the neighbourhood

17
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:23,364
used to be Mr. Eisaku's ex-girlfriend,

18
00:02:23,364 --> 00:02:25,864
so she ends up being one of the suspects.

19
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:27,464
However, at the estimated time,

20
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:28,964
the murder was thought to have been committed,

21
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:32,064
Minayo happens to be doing Eri's hair.

22
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,164
Besides, if Minayo were to be the killer,

23
00:02:34,164 --> 00:02:36,764
how could she have moved a dead body weighing 90 kilograms

24
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:38,264
to the trash dump?

25
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:42,264
And, what were the three sounds "crash, thud and rattle-rattle"

26
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:46,864
that we heard when the dead body was found?

27
00:02:49,964 --> 00:02:55,764
"Lawyer Eri Kisaki's Testimony (Part 2)"

28
00:02:55,764 --> 00:02:57,864
Conan!

29
00:02:57,864 --> 00:03:00,964
Everybody's leaving, let's go too!

30
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:02,364
Okay!

31
00:03:12,264 --> 00:03:15,864
What're those desks and chairs?

32
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:18,064
Maybe over-sized items that are to be disposed of are gathered there,

33
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,464
so that they can be picked up

34
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:22,464
during the next over-sized items trash collection day?

35
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:26,064
Minayo sure is scrupulous, isn't she?

36
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:27,464
Because, look...

37
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:30,764
She has the old newspapers and magazines all separated,

38
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:34,364
and all the cardboard boxes are nicely folded compactly and tied together.

39
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:35,664
Come on, let's go!

40
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:37,264
Okay!

41
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:46,964
Why...

42
00:03:46,964 --> 00:03:50,064
You drove through this narrow back road on your scooter?

43
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:53,064
Yes. There's usually nobody here, so...

44
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:58,364
What's with him calling me repeatedly?

45
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:01,464
-Don't you have to answer the call? -Huh?

46
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:05,664
I'll bet it's one of your beautiful woman childhood friends.

47
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:07,364
Yeah, sorry, so what!

48
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:10,864
Oh boy! Why does it always turn out like this?

49
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:14,464
It's the convenience store over there.

50
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:22,264
It's opposite the trash dump where the body was found.

51
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,564
The traffic sign pole...

52
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:29,464
It's dusted off and there are thin lines on it.

53
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:31,464
What are these lines?

54
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:37,464
Cigarette butts and trash are collected in one place.

55
00:04:38,764 --> 00:04:40,464
Why?

56
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:45,064
Is this the place?

57
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:46,964
The trash dump next to the convenience store

58
00:04:46,964 --> 00:04:50,464
that you came to throw out your trash?

59
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:51,964
Yes.

60
00:04:51,964 --> 00:04:55,064
What do you guys want?

61
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:57,064
You work for this convenience store?

62
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:58,164
Yes.

63
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,664
We're the police.

64
00:05:00,664 --> 00:05:03,364
Huh? The police?

65
00:05:03,364 --> 00:05:07,664
Just a while ago, I heard that something happened in the neighbourhood.

66
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:09,664
Yes. Regarding that incident,

67
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:13,264
I wonder if you can tell me what time she came here tonight?

68
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:16,764
Huh? What is this? Are they suspecting you, Minayo?

69
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:20,864
-Yes. -Well, we're just confirming things.

70
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:25,664
I think it was at about 20:30.

71
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:28,564
I guess I can check the receipt and tell you for sure!

72
00:05:28,564 --> 00:05:31,764
Because Minayo's the only customer who bought a bag of rice tonight!

73
00:05:34,564 --> 00:05:37,764
It says 20:28.

74
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:42,664
Do you know how long she was here back then?

75
00:05:42,664 --> 00:05:44,964
About 4 to 5 minutes, I think.

76
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:47,664
I guess we can check the surveillance camera.

77
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:52,064
Then, I guess she couldn't have committed the murder after all.

78
00:05:52,064 --> 00:05:56,564
She left me saying that she had something to do at 20:20.

79
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,964
After doing what she had to do, she came back at 20:30.

80
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:04,664
She came to this convenience store between 20:23 to 20:24,

81
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:08,064
If she left after finishing shopping at 20:28...

82
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:09,564
The time she could've used to commit the crime

83
00:06:09,564 --> 00:06:12,264
would be 3 to 4 minutes before going to the convenience store

84
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:15,164
and 2 minutes after leaving the store.

85
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:20,264
It's too short a time to carry the dead body over to the trash dump!

86
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:24,864
When she came here tonight,

87
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:27,364
she was carrying a trash bag, wasn't she?

88
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:29,864
Yes, 2 to 3 bags.

89
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:33,664
Maybe one of the bags had a dead body in it, and not trash?

90
00:06:33,664 --> 00:06:34,664
Dead body?

91
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:36,964
Please, dear...

92
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,764
No, I guess you want to say that

93
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:42,064
she carried the dead body over with the scooter, but that's not possible!

94
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:43,164
Impossible?

95
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:46,864
Because Minayo's scooter is so junk

96
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,964
that the engine stopped before she came to the store!

97
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:51,664
-It stopped? -Yes.

98
00:06:51,664 --> 00:06:56,064
Just when I went out to throw out the trash, in front of the store.

99
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:57,864
Just as Minayo was coming out of the back road

100
00:06:57,864 --> 00:06:59,664
where her house is to where she came out to this road just about here.

101
00:06:59,664 --> 00:07:02,064
I saw it jerk to a halt!

102
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:04,464
After that, you got off your scooter

103
00:07:04,464 --> 00:07:07,364
and came here pushing it along, right?

104
00:07:07,364 --> 00:07:10,364
Yes. But it started to move after a while,

105
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,364
so I drove it back home.

106
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:15,664
Now you know, that she's not the one!

107
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:18,164
She's my precious beautician,

108
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:20,864
so will you please stop hassling her?

109
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:24,264
Right, good work.

110
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:28,664
Protect me good, Attorney at Law Kisaki.

111
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:33,564
Huh? There's blonde hair stuck by your stomach, Miss!

112
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:36,664
No... no way?

113
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,764
I made sure I changed clothes.

114
00:07:39,764 --> 00:07:42,464
Another good look and it's brown hair!

115
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:44,964
It's Ms. Kisaki's hair!

116
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,864
Yes.

117
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:49,664
The way she just reacted...

118
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:52,664
She's the killer after all.

119
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:54,564
But I can't figure it out.

120
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:56,664
From Minayo's beauty shop

121
00:07:56,664 --> 00:07:58,564
to the trash dump where the dead body was found,

122
00:07:58,564 --> 00:08:01,764
it's true that it's very close if in a straight line.

123
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:04,164
But she went shopping at the convenience store

124
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:07,264
that's opposite the trash dump.

125
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:11,564
If so, the time left for her to commit the crime is really slight.

126
00:08:12,364 --> 00:08:13,664
With just so little time left, how did she move

127
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:16,764
the body of a man who weighs 90 kilograms?

128
00:08:21,264 --> 00:08:23,064
You're hurt after all!

129
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:24,364
Hurt?

130
00:08:24,364 --> 00:08:26,164
I wonder where I got hurt?

131
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:29,764
Remember, when dad slammed on the brakes...

132
00:08:31,964 --> 00:08:33,864
I get it! Sudden braking!

133
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:49,664
If my deduction is correct,

134
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,664
it should be somewhere here.

135
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:57,964
Just as I thought, after all.

136
00:08:57,964 --> 00:09:00,164
I've figured everything out!

137
00:09:01,964 --> 00:09:05,364
A dreadful trick that sent a man on a death...

138
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:08,664
plunge to the pits of hell!

139
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:16,464
Not again.

140
00:09:16,464 --> 00:09:19,864
Like I've been saying for some time already.

141
00:09:19,864 --> 00:09:22,864
Ms. Hasaka couldn't have committed the crime!

142
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:24,664
But, Ms. Kisaki...

143
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:29,564
The fact that Ms. Hasaka was not with you between 20:10 to 20:30

144
00:09:29,564 --> 00:09:33,564
which is the estimated time of death,

145
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:35,464
for some reason really bothers me.

146
00:09:35,464 --> 00:09:39,964
Right, right. Ms. Hasaka is after all his ex-girlfriend, too.

147
00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:43,164
That's irrelevant right now, isn't it?

148
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:45,964
The image on the surveillance camera also shows that

149
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:51,664
she was unmistakably in the shop for 4 minutes between 20:24 and 20:28.

150
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:53,564
The only time she had to commit the crime

151
00:09:53,564 --> 00:09:56,864
was 4 minutes from 20:20 to 20:24

152
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:59,864
and 2 minutes from 20:28 to 20:30!

153
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:02,164
Just how do you propose that she carry

154
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:06,164
the dead body of a man who weighs 90 kilograms

155
00:10:06,164 --> 00:10:08,764
to the trash dump that is two slopes below?

156
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:12,464
Or, is it that you're giving her a hard time

157
00:10:12,464 --> 00:10:14,464
because she's my beautician?

158
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:17,464
Don't be ridiculous!

159
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:26,164
Hey, mom!

160
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:28,264
You're taking it a bit too far!

161
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:32,864
Dad actually came here today to come pick you up, you know?

162
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:36,164
I knew that to begin with.

163
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:39,764
Then, why?

164
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,864
It just annoys me that,

165
00:10:42,864 --> 00:10:46,064
that guy doesn't bother to say a word about it to me!

166
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:49,564
Then, why didn't you ask him yourself and say,

167
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:52,464
"Did you come to pick me up?"

168
00:10:52,464 --> 00:10:53,464
What're you talking about?

169
00:10:53,464 --> 00:10:56,764
Are you telling me to win the favor of that mustached chauvinist?

170
00:10:56,764 --> 00:11:00,364
No way!

171
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:02,364
Gosh.

172
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:05,864
-Ms. Hasaka. -Yes.

173
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:10,264
May I have your permission to check inside your house, just to be sure?

174
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:12,664
What? But...

175
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:14,764
No way!

176
00:11:16,164 --> 00:11:18,464
Under Article 35 of the Constitution!

177
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:20,064
The right of all persons to be secure

178
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:21,964
in their homes, papers and effects against entries,

179
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:26,764
searches and seizures shall not be impaired,

180
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:32,064
except upon warrant issued for adequate cause

181
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:38,264
and particularly describing the place to be searched and things to be seized!

182
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,464
If you insist on investigating,

183
00:11:40,464 --> 00:11:43,864
please do so after getting an arrest, search or seizure warrant

184
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:46,564
from a competent judicial officer, will you?

185
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:48,964
But...

186
00:11:48,964 --> 00:11:50,564
Well, with circumstances showing that

187
00:11:50,564 --> 00:11:51,864
she couldn't have committed the murder,

188
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:54,964
it would be hard to get what's needed though.

189
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:59,564
Good. Very well done, Attorney at Law Kisaki.

190
00:11:59,564 --> 00:12:01,864
I was perfectly correct

191
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:05,264
in choosing you as the one to testify my alibi.

192
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:08,664
Okay, you want me to prove it?

193
00:12:08,664 --> 00:12:11,764
That she too, could've committed the murder.

194
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:19,564
My, you sure sound like you're ready to prove it?

195
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:23,164
Oh, no, well, it's not me, you see...

196
00:12:34,064 --> 00:12:36,564
-It's... -Come!

197
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:39,164
-Sleeping Kogoro! -Sleeping Kogoro!

198
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:44,064
I'm glad I had Dr. Agasa make me a spare voice changer bow-tie.

199
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,864
Hold it!

200
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:49,764
Didn't you just say, "It's not me" or something like that?

201
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:53,464
So... I was going to say,

202
00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:56,964
it doesn't have to be me explain this super simple trick!

203
00:12:56,964 --> 00:12:59,364
The simple trick that Ms. Hasaka used, first killing Mr. Eisaku

204
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:03,764
then throwing him out in the trash dump two slopes below!

205
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:12,745
Inspector!

206
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:15,745
Will you please get ready a strong fishing line used for big catch

207
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:19,645
as well as cement bags that can be used as substitute for the victim?

208
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:22,745
-Officer Takagi, get them ready, will you? -Yes, sir!

209
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:27,345
And before we start, please take some pictures first.

210
00:13:27,345 --> 00:13:28,645
Some pictures?

211
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:30,045
Take a picture of the stand of the guard rail

212
00:13:30,045 --> 00:13:32,645
right above the trash dump where the body was found

213
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:38,045
and the tiny thin lines that are on the pillar of the traffic sign

214
00:13:38,045 --> 00:13:41,945
that is around the corner on the way to the convenience store,

215
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:44,345
as well as the little amount of trash that is gathered in a circle

216
00:13:44,345 --> 00:13:47,145
on the road near the traffic sign!

217
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:55,745
Mr. Mouri, everything's ready.

218
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:57,845
Let's begin, then.

219
00:13:57,845 --> 00:14:02,245
First, please put down the chair that is on the desk over there.

220
00:14:02,245 --> 00:14:06,045
The first thing that bothered me was that chair.

221
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:12,145
The height of the chair is set as the highest it can go.

222
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:13,845
Yes, true.

223
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:16,945
Minayo seems to be a scrupulous character

224
00:14:16,945 --> 00:14:18,445
judging from the way she separates old newspapers

225
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:19,945
and old magazines like they should be,

226
00:14:19,945 --> 00:14:22,945
as well as folds cardboard boxes compactly and ties them together.

227
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,745
Nonetheless, it bothered me that

228
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:29,445
only that chair was left as is, at its highest position.

229
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:32,545
I guess I just happened to overlook it.

230
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:35,545
No! In order to make your trick work,

231
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:38,845
you needed to keep the chair at its highest position!

232
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:42,645
I'll redo the trick for you right now!

233
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:45,045
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

234
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:47,045
First, tie the fishing line that you got ready

235
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:49,345
onto the spindle of the chair!

236
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:50,345
Make sure you tie it on tightly

237
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:53,045
so that it doesn't come off even after pulling on it!

238
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:55,445
Next pass the tip of the line

239
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,945
through the other side of the pillar of the guard rail

240
00:14:57,945 --> 00:15:00,145
where the trash dump where the dead body was found

241
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:03,545
is in view right ahead below and come back.

242
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:10,145
Then adjust the length of the line from the chair to the guard rail

243
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:13,545
to almost the same as the distance from the back of the beauty salon

244
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,345
to the road where the convenience store is,

245
00:15:16,345 --> 00:15:20,645
and tie it on to the scooter that is parked at the backdoor.

246
00:15:20,645 --> 00:15:21,845
All done!

247
00:15:21,845 --> 00:15:26,045
Then, please tie another line to the back of the scooter,

248
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:27,745
but this time, make the length of the line

249
00:15:27,745 --> 00:15:28,845
a little longer than the distance

250
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:32,345
from the guard rail to the road leading out to the convenience store

251
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:35,045
and tie it on to the spindle of the chair.

252
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:37,645
Then finally place the bags of cement on the chair

253
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,345
as substitute for the dead body and all is set!

254
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:42,645
All that's left to do is

255
00:15:42,645 --> 00:15:45,145
to head for the convenience store on that scooter.

256
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:50,145
Hey, are you ready over on that side?

257
00:15:50,145 --> 00:15:51,145
Yes, sir!

258
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:54,345
Just as you ordered, all the onlookers have been evacuated!

259
00:15:54,345 --> 00:15:55,945
Okay, I got it!

260
00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:57,845
Officer Takagi!

261
00:15:57,845 --> 00:15:58,845
Yes, sir!

262
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:02,545
At first, go slow so that the cement bag doesn't fall off

263
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,745
and gradually accelerate!

264
00:16:04,745 --> 00:16:06,445
All right, sir!

265
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:27,645
Inspector Megure!

266
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:31,145
The cement bag fell into the trash dump!

267
00:16:32,345 --> 00:16:33,645
Okay!

268
00:16:33,645 --> 00:16:36,745
If the chair crashes into the guard rail with force,

269
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,245
through the law of inertia,

270
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:40,645
the dead body that is on the chair should fly off

271
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:44,445
and fall into the trash dump two slopes below.

272
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:46,245
Then from the impact of the crash,

273
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:48,245
the first line that was tied is severed.

274
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:52,345
If the scooter is pushed as is, all the way to the convenience store,

275
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,145
the chair is pulled with the line that was tied on later

276
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:58,545
and is returned to the back road where it was to begin with.

277
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,945
The law of inertia...

278
00:17:01,945 --> 00:17:08,045
So, the crash, thud and rattle-rattling sounds that we heard were these.

279
00:17:09,145 --> 00:17:12,845
The thin lines on the guard rail and the traffic sign were marks

280
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:15,445
left behind by the line scrapping against them.

281
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:18,345
But if the dead body were to be seated on the chair,

282
00:17:18,345 --> 00:17:20,345
wouldn't its legs be sandwiched between the guard rail

283
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:22,245
so that it wouldn't fly all that far?

284
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:23,945
In order for that not to happen,

285
00:17:23,945 --> 00:17:27,245
the victim was probably seated cross-legged.

286
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:29,445
The seat was probably adjusted to the highest possible position

287
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:33,145
to avoid the dead body from getting stuck by the guard rail.

288
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:36,545
Then, what about the trash that was gathered in a circle on the road?

289
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:39,345
When Minayo came back from the convenience store,

290
00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:41,445
the line that she was dragging along scrapped

291
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:44,045
and gathered the trash on the road.

292
00:17:44,045 --> 00:17:46,445
The scooter stopped moving suddenly

293
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:51,145
because the chair bumped into the guard rail causing it to stop.

294
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:52,845
Do you have proof?

295
00:17:52,845 --> 00:17:55,945
Proof that I killed him!

296
00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:58,145
It's so rude to treat me as if I were a killer

297
00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:59,745
despite having no proof.

298
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,945
Isn't it, Ms. Kisaki?

299
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:06,945
The evidence is most probably...

300
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:13,245
Oh no! He got up at the worst timing!

301
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:18,945
And, where's the proof?

302
00:18:18,945 --> 00:18:20,245
Proof?

303
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:22,945
Civil Code Article 239!

304
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:24,645
Ownership of movables without an owner

305
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:29,945
shall be acquired by possessing the same with the intention to own!

306
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:33,045
In other words, trash that is once thrown into the trash dump

307
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:38,145
becomes the possession of whoever finds the trash necessary.

308
00:18:38,145 --> 00:18:39,845
Maybe if we have them check the trash

309
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:41,545
that you threw out on the way to the convenience store,

310
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:43,445
everything will come to light?

311
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:46,845
If you're the killer, you would most probably want to

312
00:18:46,845 --> 00:18:49,045
dispose of the blood smeared cape and towel

313
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:52,745
as soon as you possibly can, right?

314
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:00,945
Judging from the looks of it,

315
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:03,645
I don't think we need to do further checking.

316
00:19:03,645 --> 00:19:05,345
It's so sad

317
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:09,045
to think that you would use me to establish your alibi.

318
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:14,745
You probably called Mr. Eisaku over to your house before I came,

319
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:16,945
and used the 10 minutes that was needed

320
00:19:16,945 --> 00:19:20,645
to set the dye into my hair to kill Mr. Eisaku.

321
00:19:20,645 --> 00:19:22,445
Then you used the trick explained just now

322
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:24,945
to throw the dead body over.

323
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:27,645
When you retrieved the line,

324
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:29,445
you forgot to adjust the height of the chair

325
00:19:29,445 --> 00:19:32,145
to its original low position, in your haste.

326
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:34,745
You threw the dead body into the trash dump

327
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:36,645
because you wanted someone to find it quickly,

328
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:41,045
so that the span of the estimated time of death wouldn't be too great.

329
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:44,445
You held that bad a grudge against Mr. Eisaku, eh?

330
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:47,445
I don't hate him that much.

331
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:51,745
I hated the RV talent who got engaged to him.

332
00:19:51,745 --> 00:19:53,645
She had the nerve to lure him into having an engagement with her

333
00:19:53,645 --> 00:19:55,145
during the time that he and I were having a fight

334
00:19:55,145 --> 00:19:58,745
and decided not to see each other for a while. It's her that I hate!

335
00:19:58,745 --> 00:20:01,145
Then, why did you kill him?

336
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:02,645
Do you know?

337
00:20:02,645 --> 00:20:07,345
When he first debut as a wrestler, he had short black hair.

338
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:08,845
That woman's the one who changed his hair

339
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:11,145
to blonde medium length hair.

340
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:13,645
I just couldn't stand myself

341
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:18,545
doing as that woman ordered.

342
00:20:18,545 --> 00:20:21,245
I couldn't stand him watching contentedly

343
00:20:21,245 --> 00:20:23,245
while she did as she pleased.

344
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:26,045
You should've refused then.

345
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:28,645
When I became a beautician,

346
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:32,045
I promised that I would cut his hair through his entire life!

347
00:20:32,045 --> 00:20:36,145
Yes. I didn't want to let anyone cut his hair.

348
00:20:36,145 --> 00:20:38,545
Nor, did I want to cut his hair myself either.

349
00:20:38,545 --> 00:20:41,445
So, I had no choice but to do what I did.

350
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:50,145
Well, we'll hear the rest of your story at the Police Department.

351
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:52,245
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

352
00:20:56,545 --> 00:21:01,045
Ms. Kisaki, you'd better be careful too.

353
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:03,945
You're fighting with him over trivial matters.

354
00:21:03,945 --> 00:21:06,045
Being stubborn with each other

355
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:09,045
may lead to irredeemable consequences.

356
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:11,145
Come on, let's go.

357
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:16,445
It's really too bad that I won't be able to hear any more

358
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:20,745
lovey-dovey stories of you and your husband!

359
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:22,345
Lovey-dovey?

360
00:21:22,345 --> 00:21:24,345
No! It's not what you think.

361
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:25,945
It's not lovey-dovey stories.

362
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:28,545
Is that true?

363
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:31,145
You idiot! Of course not.

364
00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:33,345
Is it true?

365
00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:09,645
Yes, it's true!

366
00:23:09,645 --> 00:23:13,045
Does it bother you?

367
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:16,545
You really won 1 million 200 thousand yen betting on a dark horse?

368
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:18,745
-What? -Well, congratulations!

369
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:20,545
We must toast to your win tonight!

370
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:21,745
What? You're drinking already?

371
00:23:21,745 --> 00:23:24,645
I'll be right over! Hold on!

372
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:29,245
That phone call just now?

373
00:23:29,245 --> 00:23:31,445
It was from one of my horse racing buddies

374
00:23:31,445 --> 00:23:34,045
that kept calling me from some time ago.

375
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,345
He kept calling persistently

376
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:37,545
because he wanted me to join him drinking in celebration of the win!

377
00:23:43,445 --> 00:23:45,445
Huh? What?

378
00:23:46,645 --> 00:23:48,545
Who cares!

379
00:23:48,545 --> 00:23:52,545
And? What with the case?

380
00:23:52,545 --> 00:23:54,445
Who cares.

381
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:56,845
Who cares, same here.

382
00:23:59,245 --> 00:24:01,245
"Next Episode."

383
00:24:01,245 --> 00:24:04,645
Eisuke, you've come back to school!

384
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:06,745
Yeah! Just today.

385
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,245
I've no idea who he is,

386
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:12,045
but the only thing I can guess is...

387
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:15,445
He's the FBI investigator who's been tailing Eisuke.

388
00:24:21,245 --> 00:24:23,945
Don't tell me, he...

389
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:29,145
Next Conan, "The Blind Spot of the Karaoke Booth (Part 1)"

390
00:24:44,845 --> 00:24:47,145
Next Conan's Hint:

391
00:24:47,145 --> 00:24:49,645
"Eisuke Hondo."

392
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:51,445
The stage for the next episode is at a Karaoke booth.

393
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:54,045
I may sing off tune, but my deductions are never off.
