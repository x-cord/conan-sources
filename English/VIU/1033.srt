1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,820
Happy New Year.

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,639
It's now 2022, and thanks to all of you,

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,200
the Detective Conan anime has started its 27th year.

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,139
The previous year and the year before that were tough,

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,210
but we hope we'll be able to exit that long tunnel soon.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,879
Take care of your health.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,760
We appreciate your continued support for the anime, movies, and Shonen Sunday.

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,010
And so...

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,940
Happy New Year!

10
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,459
It comes to visit after falling asleep!

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,650
Fall in love with logical deduction and the pleasure of solving mysteries!

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,479
Taiko Meijin is suspected of cheating?

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,149
A shogi board is found at the crime scene!

14
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,589
Always determining the one truth

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,349
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,780
his name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,270
"Taiko Meijin's Shogi Board, Opening Move!"

18
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,270
Oh, right.

19
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,499
What is it, Mitsuhiko?

20
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,900
What are you looking at?

21
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,580
Oh, you know.

22
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,849
Ah! It says online that Japan won today's afternoon match.

23
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,840
Seriously?

24
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,299
All right!

25
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,879
Come to think of it, there was a game today.

26
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,700
This is unusual behavior for a soccer fanatic like you.

27
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,219
There's something here about Higo, Haibara-san.

28
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,170
Really?

29
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,869
Look. It says Double H played a huge role on Samurai Blue.

30
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,179
Wow!

31
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,239
That's so cool!

32
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,059
Hey, what's Double H?

33
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,110
What?

34
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,769
Wh-What?

35
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,169
You don't know?

36
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,070
Seriously?

37
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,320
Sorry, I guess.

38
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,740
Double H refers to...

39
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:47,599
Tokyo Spirits' Hide and Big Osaka's Higo.

40
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,250
Lately people have been calling them Double H.

41
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,750
Oh, really?

42
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,109
So there are things you don't know after all, Edogawa-kun.

43
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,750
Everyone knows that.

44
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,179
Come to think of it, Haibara-san is an H, too.

45
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,210
You're right.

46
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,760
I don't have time for that right now.

47
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,730
I need to look into Taiko Meijin's family, the Hanedas.

48
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:20,719
Anyway, I wonder whose mansion their mother was working at.

49
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,119
Iori the butler told me.

50
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,189
It's the mansion of a famous guy you're quite familiar with.

51
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,490
A famous guy?

52
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,769
The hextuple crown shogi player.

53
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,250
It's the home of Haneda Shukichi's family.

54
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,220
What?

55
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,250
Apparently the rest of the world doesn't know about it yet.

56
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,700
I-I see.

57
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,910
Isn't Haneda Akai-san's younger brother and Sera's older brother?

58
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,999
17 years ago, his brother-in-law Haneda Koji

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,980
was force fed APTX 4869 by someone in America.

60
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,060
In other words, the quadruple crown shogi player Haneda Koji

61
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,830
was the son of a wealthy family.

62
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,330
These days, when you search for shogi, this news story keeps coming up.

63
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,580
"Missing Shogi Player Nishikigo Suspected of Match Fixing Turns Up Dead."

64
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,310
"Still No Progress," huh?

65
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,360
According to those close to the investigation HQ, it may be some kind of message from the culprit.

66
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,350
left at the crime scene had been cut off."

67
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,509
Why just one leg of the board?

68
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,460
Hey.

69
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,729
What's "happyakunaga?"

70
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,539
Actually, it's—

71
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,610
It's read as yaocho (match fixing).

72
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,999
It's when someone deliberately loses a game.

73
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,079
You know, like how Edogawa-kun intentionally loses to you guys at video games.

74
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,619
What?

75
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,500
You've been doing that on purpose?

76
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,459
You noticed?

77
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,249
Aw, man.

78
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,130
Actually, that wasn't on purpose.

79
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,259
Where did the term "yaocho" come from?

80
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,719
I don't know. Sumo, maybe?

81
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,020
Maybe it originated from shogi.

82
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,400
It's not from shogi.

83
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,150
It originally comes from go.

84
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,030
Taiko Meijin!

85
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,910
Long ago, there was a yaoya (greengrocer) named Chobe.

86
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,830
Everyone called him Yaocho.

87
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,189
He wanted his go friends to buy his products,

88
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,580
so he put them in good moods by deliberately losing to them.

89
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:46,840
But one day, Chobe-san played a close match against a skilled go player,

90
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,840
and people discovered how good he actually was at the game.

91
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,639
Since then, deliberately losing for the benefit of yourself or others

92
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,310
has been called yaocho (match fixing).

93
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,250
Hey, Taiko Meijin.

94
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,029
Have you ever played against Nishikido, the shogi player who was found dead?

95
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,240
Yeah. A few times, at events.

96
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,059
He didn't make much of an impression.

97
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,500
But just once, the move he made after returning from the bathroom

98
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,650
was so unbelievably brilliant it surprised me.

99
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,339
I still managed to win, though.

100
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,649
Huh.

101
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,240
By the way...

102
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,499
Are you going on a date with Yumi-san today?

103
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,640
What? Wh-What makes you say that?

104
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,900
Because normally you have stubble when you're not wearing a kimono, but you shaved today.

105
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,349
Now that you mention it...

106
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,270
I didn't notice.

107
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,259
N-No, it's because I'm meeting someone important.

108
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,899
It's not a date.

109
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,570
Well, see you later.

110
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,279
Aw, so it's not a date.

111
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,910
I thought I was right.

112
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,669
What are you doing, Yumi-san?

113
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,050
Wh-What am I doing?

114
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,840
I'm following Chukichi.

115
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,759
Why are you following him?

116
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,399
Did you have a fight?

117
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,079
No, we didn't have a fight.

118
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,900
But lately Chukichi's been acting strange.

119
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,759
He's been getting dressed up and sneaking out a lot.

120
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,220
When I ask him where he's going, he dodges the question.

121
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:40,540
S-Since we started living together, I've been seeing sides of him I don't need to see.

122
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,580
I'm probably overthinking it.

123
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,420
In all likelihood...

124
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,970
In all likelihood?

125
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,970
He's having an affair.

126
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,999
You think so, too?!

127
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,239
It's probably because you started living together.

128
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,889
Apparently it's common for men to get comfortable

129
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,980
and cheat once they know they've locked down the woman they love.

130
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,610
Come on, really?

131
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,610
Damn it, Chukichi.

132
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,209
Looks like I'll have to keep following him after all.

133
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,490
Good luck with that.

134
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,790
Gotcha.

135
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,250
Hey, wait!

136
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,759
You're going to help me.

137
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,250
He's less likely to notice I'm following him if I've got a kid with me.

138
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,449
There they go.

139
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,380
Good luck, Conan-kun.

140
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,970
Welcome.

141
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,520
Hey, listen.

142
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,359
I'm pretty sure he's just buying donuts.

143
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,150
Yeah.

144
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,160
The question is, who is he buying them for?

145
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,030
He's buying a whole lot of them.

146
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,559
Maybe he's getting together with friends for drinks.

147
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,090
He could also be seeing a girl who eats a lot.

148
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,540
I-I guess so.

149
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,969
More importantly, have you met Taiko Meijin's parents?

150
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,800
No, not yet.

151
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,259
I heard he was adopted by some super rich family

152
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,150
when he was trying to become a professional shogi player.

153
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:31,660
The son of the family was some kind of shogi genius, but he died in an accident.

154
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,190
They asked to adopt him so he could fulfill their son's dream.

155
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,630
So Haneda Koji really was the son of a wealthy family,

156
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,560
and Taiko Meijin was adopted by them so he could carry on his dream.

157
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,209
Apparently the biggest reason Chukichi agreed

158
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,669
to be adopted was because he became obsessed with shogi.

159
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,710
Huh.

160
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,829
Then have you met Taiko Meijin's biological family?

161
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,720
I haven't met them yet either.

162
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,419
Apparently he's got a mom, an older brother, and a younger sister.

163
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,230
I bet the whole family's laid back and carefree like him.

164
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,729
I don't think a single one of them is carefree.

165
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,289
Thank you very much!

166
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,210
He came back out.

167
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,660
Huh?

168
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,490
Star Donut?

169
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,380
Which means...

170
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,460
No way. This place is Star Donut.

171
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,659
The other day I saw it in a magazine

172
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,460
and suggested to Chukichi that we come here sometime.

173
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,789
Could it be that Chukichi bought those for me?

174
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,299
Hey, guys!

175
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,230
Huh?

176
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,930
W-Women?

177
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,810
Not only that, but...

178
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,810
Two of them?!

179
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,070
No way. This place is Star Donut.

180
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,179
The other day I saw it in a magazine

181
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,080
and suggested to Chukichi that we come here sometime.

182
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,379
Could it be that Chukichi bought those for me?

183
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,919
Hey, guys!

184
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,770
Huh?

185
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,550
W-Women?

186
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,430
Not only that, but...

187
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,430
Two of them?!

188
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,979
Hey, these are from Star Donut.

189
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,969
Where's the shop?

190
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,289
Just down the street.

191
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,439
You even know about places like Star Donut?

192
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,869
Aw, shucks.

193
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,079
Yeah, because I saw it in a magazine and told him about it.

194
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,969
Yeah, that's right. Yumi-tan—

195
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,450
Wait, Y-Yumi-tan?

196
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,109
You seem to be having fun, Chukichi.

197
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,370
H-Having fun?

198
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,269
Yumi-tan? As in Taiko Meijin's girlfriend Yumi-san?

199
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,010
We hear about you from the Meijin all the time.

200
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,559
What? Uh, hello.

201
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,899
But, Yumi-tan, what are you doing here?

202
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,639
Huh? Oh, uh...

203
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,409
And what's Conan-kun doing with you?

204
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,239
Yumi-san thought you were cheating on—

205
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,190
Conan-kun insisted on getting Star Donut!

206
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,780
So, what are you guys all doing together?

207
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,780
A shogi study session with those girls?

208
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,009
Yeah. They're female shogi players.

209
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,229
They want to hone their skills at a high level on a regular basis,

210
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,289
so I attend their sessions sometimes.

211
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,420
I see.

212
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,079
I'm actually doing this because her father asked me to.

213
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,800
That's right.

214
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,689
Her father?

215
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:51,209
You know, Katsumata Chikara Osho, the guy I played against

216
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,560
in my Meijin title match in Yamanashi.

217
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,560
It's time to reveal the sealed move.

218
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,780
The sealed move is 5-6 silver.

219
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,120
I need to think.

220
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,130
What? Sextuple Crown Haneda took a taxi to Tokyo?

221
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:27,920
An unspoken rule forbids him from using a cell phone during a match.

222
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:34,830
I don't know what happened, but he said he needed to think before he left.

223
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:41,190
He hasn't thrown in the towel against Meijin Katsumata Chikara yet.

224
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,659
Let's wait for the man attempting to beat me,

225
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,700
take all seven titles, and become a living god.

226
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,559
What match?

227
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,749
My Meijin title match was today.

228
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,040
Meijin title match?

229
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,250
Where and when is that?

230
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,259
I'd need to get to the Tokiwa Hotel in Yamanashi by three.

231
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,920
But there's only an hour and half left, so...

232
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,430
Chukichi, don't underestimate this car.

233
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,700
Thirty seconds.

234
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,959
Thank you for waiting.

235
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,629
I don't mind, but are you all right?

236
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:30,450
You've used up all your clock time and have less than a minute to play.

237
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:36,410
Yes. Right now, that minute feels limitless.

238
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,910
Oh, that guy.

239
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,159
I'm Katsumata Mina.

240
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,789
My father has his hands full teaching his own students,

241
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,309
so I asked Haneda Meijin to help me.

242
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,159
And this is my rival.

243
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,559
I'm Uryu Shoko.

244
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,680
Together, Mina-san and I are working hard to become female Meijins.

245
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,619
So you always get together with these two to play shogi?

246
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,109
No, it's not just them.

247
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,139
Apparently Hishinuma-san is already back.

248
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,340
You're right.

249
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,289
Hishinuma-san, the Meijin brought his girlfriend.

250
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,700
What? Seriously?

251
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,809
I've been learning a lot from the Meijin.

252
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,620
I'm Hishinuma Kosuke.

253
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,729
Hello.

254
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,790
He participates in our study sessions, too.

255
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,119
It's an honor to meet the Yumi-san.

256
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,249
He's a huge Taiko Meijin fan.

257
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,680
He even copied that bedhead hairstyle from the Meijin.

258
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,930
That's right.

259
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,739
I see.

260
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,710
Chukichi's bedhead is all natural, though.

261
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,209
Anyway, we've got a problem.

262
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,810
I only bought enough coffee for us.

263
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:53,129
This place's coffee has gotten worse, so it's not any different from instant.

264
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,589
What? Really?

265
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,460
Yeah.

266
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,159
Want to try some?

267
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,580
Let me see.

268
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,469
You're right. It tastes worse.

269
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,210
And it's not very hot.

270
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,830
Might be perfect for me. I don't like hot stuff.

271
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:16,129
In contrast, the bread I bought is freshly baked and piping hot.

272
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,459
Seriously? Wow, you're right.

273
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,380
They're so warm. I bet they're tasty.

274
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,020
Huh?

275
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,560
There's no hot curry bread this time.

276
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,939
Sorry, they were sold out.

277
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,190
Were you able to get the ice cream?

278
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,570
It wasn't too busy today, so I was able to get some freezing cold ice cream right away.

279
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,720
See?

280
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:42,330
It's so cold!

281
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,840
Hey, quit it!

282
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,489
This is for not getting my curry bread.

283
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:47,985
It wasn't my fault.

284
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,839
Let's not stand around here talking. Let's go inside.

285
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,969
Actually, I've been calling the room, but Genda-san isn't answering.

286
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,310
Who's Genda-san?

287
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,929
He's a shogi player named Genda Yasukiyo.

288
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,480
He's another member of our study group who's waiting for us in the room.

289
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,009
Maybe he got tired of waiting and fell asleep.

290
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,699
No way.

291
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,480
It's been less than ten minutes since we left.

292
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,489
I've got a spare key. We can use this to get inside.

293
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,580
You're right. I'm kind of worried, too.

294
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,060
Come in.

295
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,500
So you're all pitching in to rent an apartment, huh?

296
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,139
Yeah, for our study sessions.

297
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,130
It's actually pretty cheap split five ways.

298
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,239
Five ways?

299
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,869
Chukichi, are you paying for this place, too?

300
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,640
No.

301
00:18:46,641 --> 00:18:50,579
There was actually another member,

302
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,669
but apparently he became depressed.

303
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,150
I see.

304
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,160
He's not answering.

305
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,540
It's unlocked.

306
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,790
Come on, man. At least lock the door.

307
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,719
Genda-san, we're back.

308
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,330
Genda-san!

309
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,420
Can you hear me?

310
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,780
Hey, Genda-san.

311
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,600
Genda-san?

312
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,180
Genda-san.

313
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,940
That's odd.

314
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,899
He's not in any of the rooms.

315
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,849
Maybe he went out shopping.

316
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,409
Yeah, right. And left the front door unlocked?

317
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,490
Besides, wouldn't he have called us if he needed to buy something?

318
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,690
I guess so.

319
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,810
Genda-san?

320
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,500
G-Genda-san!

321
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,500
Hishinuma-san?

322
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,629
Genda-san, are you all right?! Genda-san!

323
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,090
What's wrong, Hishinuma-san? No way!

324
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,250
Genda-san?

325
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:07,100
You're kidding, right?

326
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,569
Genda-san! Genda-san!

327
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,350
It's no use.

328
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,319
He has no pulse. Looks like he was strangled.

329
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,019
Genda-san! Genda-san!

330
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,110
A shogi board with missing legs?

331
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,920
Could it be?

332
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,559
Yumi-san, call the police and an ambulance.

333
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,490
Got it.

334
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,990
Hello, Miwako?

335
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,579
Something's really wrong with Genda-san.

336
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,389
He's not moving.

337
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,219
How is he, Hishinuma-san?

338
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,789
He's not breathing.

339
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,619
N-No...

340
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,550
He's not dead, is he?

341
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,859
Genda-san, wake up!

342
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,530
Open your eyes, Genda-san!

343
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,550
Hey, Genda-san!

344
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,280
I see.

345
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:37,489
So Yumi suspected her boyfriend Haneda Shukichi was cheating,

346
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,170
so she followed him.

347
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,649
She learned he meets a group of young shogi players

348
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,550
at this apartment for study sessions.

349
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,550
When they came to this room where the study sessions are held,

350
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,060
this man was found murdered.

351
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,850
Looks like he was strangled.

352
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,440
There are Yoshikawa lines indicating that the victim resisted.

353
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,439
Yes, which means judging by the marks left on his neck,

354
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:14,330
the weapon was almost certainly this electrical cord left by the body.

355
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,989
How could you suspect me of cheating, Yumi-tan?

356
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,710
Because you were hiding where you were going.

357
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,460
You'd get mad if I told you I was meeting other women!

358
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,219
I'm not that petty!

359
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,350
Actually, you were pretty petty about it.

360
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,969
You two, no chit chat!

361
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:39,810
Yes, ma'am!

362
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:50,389
We're not sure if the suicide is connected to the murders of those two shogi players.

363
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,070
Those two may not be the only ones.

364
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,700
There are two legs left on the shogi board.

365
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,690
No way.

366
00:23:57,691 --> 00:23:59,080
You're kidding, right?

367
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,330
The truth is, I came to encourage you to turn yourself in.

368
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,750
How unusual for you to call me, kid.

369
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,989
The next episode of Conan is

370
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,240
"Taiko Meijin's Shogi Board, Brilliant Move!"
