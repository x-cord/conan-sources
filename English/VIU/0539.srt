1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:03,609
"Kamakura"

2
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:06,516
"10:00 am."

3
00:00:07,116 --> 00:00:08,516
We'll get to see the famous temple that's surrounded

4
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:11,016
by hydrangeas right up this hill.

5
00:00:11,016 --> 00:00:14,316
Really, it's a beautiful sight to see!

6
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:15,716
Huh?

7
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:18,216
What the... there aren't any flowers here.

8
00:00:18,216 --> 00:00:21,416
That's weird. I wonder where I went wrong.

9
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,216
Hey...

10
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:33,816
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

11
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:36,316
Saturday nights are for mystery.

12
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:38,516
The three brothers are unable to understand their parent's love.

13
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:40,816
Fight over an inheritance, results in an unfortunate case.

14
00:00:40,816 --> 00:00:42,216
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:44,016
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:46,016
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

17
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:31,088
"A Fool's Inheritance."

18
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,421
What happened? Are you all right?

19
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:38,421
Over there!

20
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:47,221
Hey you! What the heck are you doing over there?

21
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:49,821
Darn!

22
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:53,721
Tell me what that gunshot was about!

23
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:55,321
Shut up!

24
00:02:56,621 --> 00:02:57,721
Get out of the way!

25
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:59,421
Hey, wait!

26
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:20,221
That's strange.

27
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:21,621
The blood's already dried.

28
00:03:25,052 --> 00:03:26,752
It's still warm.

29
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:28,052
Then why...

30
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,852
What's this?

31
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:33,652
It looks like some sort of crystalline substance.

32
00:03:33,652 --> 00:03:38,152
Darn, that guy was quick, he got away.

33
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,852
Hey, brat. What did you find?

34
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:44,171
What the heck is this?

35
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:50,271
The victim is Mr. Hisaemon Yaguchi, 70 years old.

36
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,771
He was the owner of this house and was quite wealthy.

37
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:56,971
He was shot directly in the chest and died soon thereafter.

38
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:59,371
It was the fatal shot.

39
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:02,071
The weapon must be that rifle over there.

40
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:06,671
And, you all happen to be the witness, right?

41
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:07,771
Yeah.

42
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:10,271
Geez, what're you doing back in Kamakura again?

43
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:12,071
Just sightseeing. Sightseeing!

44
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:14,071
These kids said they wanted to watch the hydrangeas.

45
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:16,371
Inspector Yokomizo, may I have a moment with you?

46
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:21,571
Sorry to keep you waiting.

47
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,971
Is it true that my dad's dead?

48
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:27,871
Yes. Sorry, and you are?

49
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:29,871
I'm his oldest son, Rokurou.

50
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:31,471
What's your occupation?

51
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,571
I'm a film director.

52
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:35,071
Film director?

53
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:37,771
Never heard of one by that name.

54
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:41,371
Regardless, have you figured out who did it?

55
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:44,971
Before that, at 6:00 this morning, where were you?

56
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:48,971
But it was almost 10:00 when we heard the gunshot.

57
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:51,171
He was killed long before that.

58
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:52,571
Really?

59
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:55,471
Yeah, according to autopsy, his time of death is around...

60
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:57,571
Hey! Shut up about that!

61
00:04:57,571 --> 00:04:58,871
Yes, sir.

62
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:02,071
So, the time of death is around 6:00?

63
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:04,471
Then, the gunshot we heard...

64
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,271
Was that to throw us off from the actual time of death?

65
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:08,771
But, even so...

66
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:10,871
I was in Tokushima.

67
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:14,371
I went to Tokushima seeking for an interview of my new film.

68
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:17,471
I checked out of the hotel at about half-past 6:00.

69
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:20,971
And by the time, I made it back to Tokyo, it was already after 10:30.

70
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:22,771
Oh, that's right.

71
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:25,071
I also kept the stub of my air ticket.

72
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:27,171
Here you are.

73
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,871
I see.

74
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:33,071
-Check this out. -Roger.

75
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:36,571
By the way, did Hisaemon live here alone?

76
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:39,771
Yeah. He used have servants here looking after him,

77
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:43,071
but he laid them all off a half-year ago.

78
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:47,171
Jeez, to think he'd go this far just to save money.

79
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:49,771
What a stingy father he was.

80
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:53,371
He decided not to keep servants, despite owning a large house?

81
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:54,871
Do you have any other family members?

82
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:56,771
Two young brothers.

83
00:05:56,771 --> 00:06:01,671
That's right, they may know something about the case.

84
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:05,671
Well, I don't know if they'd tell the truth though.

85
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:10,971
Hey, we know you're in there.

86
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,371
Get out here right now!

87
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,171
Return the money or else!

88
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:20,371
Who're you guys?

89
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:23,071
Bug you, or what?

90
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:24,071
Hey!

91
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:27,671
Our apologies, Big Boss Yokomizo.

92
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:29,771
You guys still at it?

93
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:32,171
Yeah.

94
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:33,471
-Let's get home! -What?

95
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,971
Just go!

96
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:40,971
Mr. Yaguchi!

97
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:42,771
Mr. Akihiko Yaguchi.

98
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:45,271
This is the police! We want to talk to you.

99
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:49,271
"Akihiko Yaguchi (37) Second-born Son."

100
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:51,971
The police? What do you want?

101
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:57,671
Around 6:00, huh?

102
00:06:57,671 --> 00:07:00,171
I was at the family restaurant.

103
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:02,371
To get to my dad's house from there,

104
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:06,071
it'd take about an hour even by car.

105
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:08,171
The money it took to open this shop.

106
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:11,171
Your father was the one who covered it, wasn't he?

107
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:14,471
And even after that, you still received money from him.

108
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:18,271
Until he recently refused to give you any more, isn't that right?

109
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,871
Who told you that?

110
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:22,671
Your elder brother, Rokurou.

111
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:25,571
That jerk, Rokurou.

112
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:29,371
My brother's the one who relied on dad to fund his movies!

113
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:30,771
But since he didn't give him much,

114
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:33,171
he still had to take out loans!

115
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:40,071
Actually, the company I ran went bankrupt recently.

116
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:42,571
And my father, who had always supported me financially,

117
00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:45,671
refused to bail me out just like that.

118
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:49,571
And, let's talk about what you did around 6:00 this morning?

119
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:51,071
"Kimio Taguchi (32) Third-born Son" -Of course,

120
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,871
I was still as sleep around 6:00.

121
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:55,471
Really?

122
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:58,471
That's true.

123
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:00,671
Actually, prior to the incident,

124
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:04,471
there was someone who witnessed you at the scene.

125
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:13,571
Care to explain that?

126
00:08:13,571 --> 00:08:15,571
Well... that's for... I mean...

127
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:17,471
-Say it! -Yes.

128
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:20,071
I went to my father's house.

129
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:21,571
What for?

130
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:23,071
For the money...

131
00:08:23,071 --> 00:08:26,271
With good intentions? The early in the morning?

132
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:28,971
No. I tried to steal some...

133
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:29,971
But...

134
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:32,871
It isn't like I heard.

135
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:34,971
I can't get this safe opened.

136
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:36,471
Darn!

137
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:38,171
Don't move!

138
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:40,771
Who the heck are you?

139
00:08:44,371 --> 00:08:46,071
Kimio?

140
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:49,971
What a pathetic man you are!

141
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:52,071
To think you would act like a thief.

142
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:54,571
I just did what Akihiko asked me.

143
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:56,671
Akihiko, you say?

144
00:08:56,671 --> 00:09:00,571
Darn it, you're forever a greenhorn!

145
00:09:01,271 --> 00:09:03,871
No! I'm not a greenhorn!

146
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:07,871
It's the truth. Please believe me!

147
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:11,171
After that, I went to see my brother Akihiko.

148
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:15,571
Well? How'd it go?

149
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:17,571
Dad caught me stealing.

150
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:18,671
You moron!

151
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:21,271
I even worked out the plan on how to do it!

152
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:22,371
Worked out the plan?

153
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:24,271
What I saw wasn't what we expected at all!

154
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:26,371
Dad's safe was so sturdy, there was no way to...

155
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:27,571
A safe?

156
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:29,371
You didn't know?

157
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:33,171
Dad, an old fox! When'd he buy such a safe?

158
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:35,471
Fine. I'll do it.

159
00:09:35,471 --> 00:09:37,771
-You still want to steal it? -Of course!

160
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:41,271
I'll give you a portion of the green to shut you up.

161
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:42,671
All right.

162
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:44,871
If that safe is really that sturdy,

163
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:47,971
I've gotta prepare some tools.

164
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:53,271
That was at 6:00 this morning.

165
00:10:00,071 --> 00:10:03,571
Darn, to think you two were going to rob from dad!

166
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:05,571
It's Akihiko who told me to do it.

167
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:06,871
Don't blame me!

168
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:08,271
But you really did!

169
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:09,771
What? Disbanding right now?

170
00:10:09,771 --> 00:10:11,671
Be quiet!

171
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:12,971
Akihiko,

172
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:17,271
until 5:45 this morning, you claimed you were in a family restaurant.

173
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:20,971
This has since been confirmed by the waitress and several customers.

174
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:22,871
Yeah, of course.

175
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:27,071
Afterwards, you went to a discount shop nearby to buy some items?

176
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:31,171
A crowbar, an electric drill.

177
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:34,471
A number of witnesses confirmed this for us.

178
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:36,571
I remembered, too.

179
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:38,771
Look at your right hand.

180
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,871
This is...

181
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:43,971
Fine, I did come to steal.

182
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:46,071
But I didn't kill dad!

183
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:47,871
When I arrived, dad was already...

184
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:51,271
What the...

185
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:53,071
Who did this?

186
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:54,971
But, this is my chance.

187
00:10:57,871 --> 00:11:01,071
It really was a strong safe, though.

188
00:11:01,071 --> 00:11:03,371
I tried my best and still couldn't get it open.

189
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,471
And...

190
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:07,171
How's this?

191
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:12,171
Then, the gunshot we heard at that time was...

192
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,571
Yeah, it was me but the shotgun couldn't beat that safe.

193
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:18,571
The time of death was around 6:00 this morning.

194
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:19,971
At that time.

195
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,171
The oldest brother, Rokurou, was in Tokushima,

196
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:26,271
while Akihiko, the second youngest brother and Kimio, the youngest

197
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:30,071
were at a family restaurant, an hour's drive away by car from here.

198
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:33,571
Hisaemon was shot at close range.

199
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:36,171
After seeing the culprit wielding a rifle before his eyes,

200
00:11:36,171 --> 00:11:38,671
why didn't he try to escape?

201
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:42,471
And then the white crystalline substance.

202
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,671
Just what was that, anyway?

203
00:11:55,353 --> 00:11:56,953
Now then.

204
00:11:56,953 --> 00:11:59,253
Aside from the body,

205
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,253
what else do you notice?

206
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,453
Is something missing?

207
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:06,253
Now that you mention it...

208
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:07,753
Oh, yes.

209
00:12:07,753 --> 00:12:10,453
Dad's antique collections are gone!

210
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:11,653
Yeah.

211
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:14,953
Faugh. I'd bet it was our older brother that snatched them, right?

212
00:12:14,953 --> 00:12:16,353
What'd you say?

213
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:19,953
I bet you stole them when you come to break into the safe!

214
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:25,353
The victim recently discontinued financial aid for his sons.

215
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:28,453
He also dismissed his servants six months ago.

216
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:31,553
And then his antiques were gone.

217
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:32,853
Could it be...

218
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,353
Then, that safe is...

219
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:41,253
By the way, we found this item in this room.

220
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:44,253
It appears to be a webcam.

221
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:46,653
Who planted that thing?

222
00:12:46,653 --> 00:12:48,653
You're a pro when it comes to cameras, big bro?

223
00:12:48,653 --> 00:12:49,853
What's this?

224
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,453
Are you saying I did that?

225
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:52,753
Inspector.

226
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:55,753
I see.

227
00:12:55,753 --> 00:12:58,753
Everyone, we've come cross further information,

228
00:12:58,753 --> 00:13:00,753
so please come back over to other room again.

229
00:13:00,753 --> 00:13:02,453
By the way, officer.

230
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:04,953
Can you open that safe for us?

231
00:13:04,953 --> 00:13:07,153
Can you try something?

232
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:11,553
This?

233
00:13:11,553 --> 00:13:13,053
In this position.

234
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:20,353
-Say, Mr. officer. -What?

235
00:13:20,353 --> 00:13:23,353
Where was that stuffed eagle originally?

236
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:26,753
Let's see. Right over there.

237
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:28,753
See that dust mark?

238
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:31,053
I think the eagle was placed here.

239
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:34,953
And fell off while the victim was struggling with the culprit?

240
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:39,053
Rokurou, I have received a report

241
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:40,953
from the Tokushima Police Department.

242
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:45,253
How was it? I was in Tokushima staying at a hotel, right?

243
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:47,853
Well, it was witnessed that a man

244
00:13:47,853 --> 00:13:50,353
wearing a hat and sunglasses like yours was there.

245
00:13:50,353 --> 00:13:52,753
Yeah, you mean me.

246
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:55,053
Well, how should I know?

247
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:57,853
I heard the guest refused to remove his hat and sunglasses

248
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:00,653
even while inside his room.

249
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:03,053
That's because this is my trademark style.

250
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:04,653
I don't take these off in front of people!

251
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:06,753
But, since no one saw your face,

252
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:10,753
we can't say that guest was you, can we?

253
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:11,953
No way.

254
00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:15,753
Also, that guest's checkout time was until tomorrow.

255
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:19,453
But he suddenly decided to leave this morning, I heard.

256
00:14:19,453 --> 00:14:24,053
Perhaps he already knew that Hisaemon was dead at that time.

257
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:27,853
This morning in a haste, that must be it.

258
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:31,053
The loans you borrowed were huge.

259
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:34,053
However, you said you had already secured a way

260
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:36,753
to pay off all these debits.

261
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:39,453
-That's... -So big bro, you really did kill dad?

262
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:40,453
Absolutely no!

263
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:41,953
So, the person who went to Tokushima

264
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:44,953
was a double that you hired?

265
00:14:44,953 --> 00:14:49,753
And then you used that online webcam to monitor this study.

266
00:14:49,753 --> 00:14:52,953
In order to obtain the code for the safe.

267
00:14:52,953 --> 00:14:54,353
I see.

268
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:58,453
You saw Kimio attempt his robbery over that camera.

269
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:00,453
And decided to kill Hisaemon

270
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:04,853
and frame Kimio for it.

271
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:07,053
Because even if you couldn't open the safe,

272
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:08,953
you could inherit more this way.

273
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:11,453
-Big bro! -I knew it.

274
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,253
That's complete nonsense!

275
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:16,453
You broke into the house this morning,

276
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:19,453
and killed Hisaemon in this study.

277
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:22,053
Since there aren't any neighboring houses nearby,

278
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:25,553
there was no one around to hear the gunshot.

279
00:15:25,553 --> 00:15:28,853
Then, you ordered your double to return

280
00:15:28,853 --> 00:15:31,753
and hand over the ticket stub to you.

281
00:15:31,753 --> 00:15:34,353
That way, you could appear here as if nothing happened!

282
00:15:34,353 --> 00:15:36,253
Guess right?

283
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:39,053
No! Absolutely wrong guess!

284
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:41,053
Where the heck are we wrong?

285
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:43,353
Come right out, spit it out already!

286
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:49,453
Dad?

287
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:55,353
Rokurou, I advise you to tell the truth for your own-sake.

288
00:15:55,353 --> 00:15:58,253
If you don't, you'll be made the culprit by mistake.

289
00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:00,853
-What did you say? -What?

290
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:04,953
Hisaemon's death was actually an unfortunate accident.

291
00:16:04,953 --> 00:16:07,153
Right?

292
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:08,553
What do you mean by "accident"?

293
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:12,753
Recall the position where the body fell.

294
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:15,553
Judging from that position,

295
00:16:15,553 --> 00:16:17,753
when Hisaemon was shot,

296
00:16:17,753 --> 00:16:20,753
he would be standing about a foot away from the shelf,

297
00:16:20,753 --> 00:16:24,253
facing the wall.

298
00:16:24,253 --> 00:16:26,653
It isn't possible to stand in front of him

299
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:30,153
and shoot him in the chest like that.

300
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:35,253
Also, consider the stuffed eagle that fell next to the victim's foot.

301
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:39,353
And that branch the eagle was perched on, it was broken.

302
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:41,453
So it was, but what does that mean?

303
00:16:41,453 --> 00:16:45,553
Rokurou, you actually witnessed the entire scene, didn't you?

304
00:16:45,553 --> 00:16:48,653
On that webcam of yours.

305
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:52,853
Yeah, yes, it's true.

306
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:55,553
I saw everything.

307
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:58,453
Seeing is believing.

308
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:05,353
Look. This is the truth.

309
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:11,053
After Kimio fled,

310
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:15,053
dad sat there like that for a while.

311
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:16,053
What's...

312
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:18,253
Does anything occur as attacks?

313
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:25,653
So the trigger got tangled on the eagle's branch

314
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:27,553
and caused the gun to misfire.

315
00:17:27,553 --> 00:17:29,753
That's correct.

316
00:17:29,753 --> 00:17:32,653
The way dad died wasn't by murder.

317
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:34,153
It was an accident.

318
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,353
Hey you! If you had this on video all along,

319
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:37,953
why didn't you show us earlier?

320
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:42,453
He tried to make Akihiko and Kimio look to be murderers

321
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:44,653
in order to keep them from getting the inheritance.

322
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:46,753
-What? -That was why Rokurou

323
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:49,453
hurriedly returned from Tokushima.

324
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:51,953
Before the body was discovered.

325
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:53,453
He planned to recover the webcam and plant fake evidence

326
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:58,753
that would make it seem like the crime was committed by his brothers.

327
00:17:58,753 --> 00:18:03,353
But before he could, we discovered the body.

328
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:05,653
You jerk, how could you?

329
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:08,753
At least I proved you two innocent,

330
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:11,053
-you should thank me! -What?

331
00:18:11,053 --> 00:18:12,853
By the way, what becomes of our share of the inheritance?

332
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:15,753
That's right! Anyway, just get that safe open!

333
00:18:15,753 --> 00:18:17,953
For the two that act like robbers,

334
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:20,453
I don't think you have the right to inherit anything!

335
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:23,353
No right to inherit anything, indeed? You "Spy Camera" brat!

336
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,753
You can't just keep everything yourself!

337
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:27,153
Knock it off already!

338
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:31,353
Have you still not figured out Hisaemon's feelings?

339
00:18:31,353 --> 00:18:33,253
Dad's feeling?

340
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:35,553
After Kimio fled,

341
00:18:35,553 --> 00:18:41,553
he sat in front of the safe. Hisaemon wept in sorrow!

342
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,353
"Wept"? Dad did?

343
00:18:44,353 --> 00:18:46,953
How could you know such a thing?

344
00:18:46,953 --> 00:18:50,453
Hisaemon's collar and chest,

345
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:55,253
traces of a white crystalline substance was slightly found.

346
00:18:55,253 --> 00:18:58,253
That is most likely salt.

347
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:02,453
The tears ended up drying out on his clothes.

348
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:05,253
And left traces of salt.

349
00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:07,953
To have left salt crystals after his tear dried,

350
00:19:07,953 --> 00:19:10,653
he must have shed a lot of them, right?

351
00:19:10,653 --> 00:19:13,753
Yes. He must have cried in deep sorrow,

352
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,153
and out of great embarrassment.

353
00:19:16,153 --> 00:19:18,853
He loved and pampered you all so much.

354
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:22,853
And yet you still cannot take care of yourselves or take responsibility.

355
00:19:22,853 --> 00:19:24,653
It was due to the pampering that

356
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:28,153
he felt he had lead you to a life of crime.

357
00:19:28,153 --> 00:19:31,053
And finally he felt hopeless

358
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:34,853
because he could no longer financially support you.

359
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:36,953
No longer support, what do you mean?

360
00:19:36,953 --> 00:19:40,453
There's nothing left in this house

361
00:19:40,453 --> 00:19:42,453
that can be considered valuable.

362
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:44,253
That can't be!

363
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:45,853
Think about it for a moment.

364
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,653
In a house as large as this one on such a steep hill,

365
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:50,453
would a senile 70 year-old man

366
00:19:50,453 --> 00:19:53,853
live all alone and not hire any servants to help him?

367
00:19:53,853 --> 00:19:55,353
Why do you think that is?

368
00:19:55,353 --> 00:19:59,753
No longer... that means he had no money left to hire anyone?

369
00:19:59,753 --> 00:20:01,553
He likely sold all his antiques,

370
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:06,353
and had to mortgage his house along with the land.

371
00:20:06,353 --> 00:20:10,153
No way! What the heck is the safe for, then?

372
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:11,853
Tell me what could possibly be in there.

373
00:20:11,853 --> 00:20:14,253
Inspector.

374
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:15,853
We have opened the safe.

375
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:17,953
Understand.

376
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:20,753
Why not go see for yourself?

377
00:20:23,553 --> 00:20:25,853
Oh, no. It can't be.

378
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:30,053
Why... they're all loan contracts.

379
00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:33,653
You guys mooched him off, that's why.

380
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:35,253
Not to mention your movie production costs,

381
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:39,953
surf shop costs, and company operation costs.

382
00:20:41,353 --> 00:20:42,553
Gosh!

383
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:43,753
What do we do now?

384
00:20:43,753 --> 00:20:45,653
It's all over.

385
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:58,153
This... could this be of you three?

386
00:20:58,153 --> 00:20:59,653
Yeah.

387
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:03,753
That's from when mom was still alive.

388
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:07,053
That's right. It's so nostalgic.

389
00:21:25,653 --> 00:21:30,153
This photo is what Hisaemon left behind,

390
00:21:30,153 --> 00:21:33,353
his final inheritance.

391
00:21:33,353 --> 00:21:37,353
The happy memories you shared as a family.

392
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:40,653
They're all presents in that only one photo.

393
00:21:40,653 --> 00:21:46,453
However, none of you was able to inherit that present.

394
00:21:48,553 --> 00:21:51,253
Guess not.

395
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:54,053
Sorry, dad.

396
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:24,453
I'm glad about our family,

397
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:26,853
since we don't have to worry about fighting over inheritance.

398
00:23:26,853 --> 00:23:29,953
Oh, yeah, guess you're right.

399
00:23:29,953 --> 00:23:31,353
This is it.

400
00:23:31,353 --> 00:23:32,853
Dad?

401
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:34,753
Miss.

402
00:23:34,753 --> 00:23:38,353
Please grab me all these sake bottles.

403
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:41,353
-Yes, sir. -Hold it, dad!

404
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:42,753
What're you doing?

405
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:45,453
What am I doing? I'm buying sake for souvenirs.

406
00:23:45,453 --> 00:23:47,553
If it's just for a souvenir, just buy one bottle!

407
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:50,653
-One bottle! -Don't be so stingy.

408
00:23:51,753 --> 00:23:55,253
There won't be any inheritance left at this rate.

409
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:00,453
It could be a regular call of love?

410
00:24:00,453 --> 00:24:03,953
You sink into despair? What the hay?

411
00:24:03,953 --> 00:24:06,153
Ga? Mr. Gamou?

412
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,553
Then, was it true?

413
00:24:08,553 --> 00:24:11,653
He was desperate enough to, he talked you on the phone.

414
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:14,853
Inspector. He must be killed by someone!

415
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,053
But...

416
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:18,153
He was innocent, but I suspected him.

417
00:24:18,153 --> 00:24:21,553
By pressing him, I caused his death.

418
00:24:21,553 --> 00:24:23,053
Next Conan,

419
00:24:23,053 --> 00:24:30,253
"The Day Detective Kogoro Mouri Goes Out of Business (Part 1)"

420
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:43,855
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:43,855 --> 00:24:46,255
"Flashlight."

422
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:48,155
Dad's probably going to give up being a detective.

423
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:50,155
What's that you say? Mouri?

424
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,555
Don't yell.
