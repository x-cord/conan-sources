1
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:08,633
I'm absolutely certain. It's this building.

2
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:16,272
Just the thought of this mansion becoming a factory that makes tasty cakes...

3
00:00:16,273 --> 00:00:18,273
Private Property Do Not Enter

4
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:20,523
Is kind of exciting.

5
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:27,462
I want shortcake and mont blanc.

6
00:00:27,463 --> 00:00:30,542
In that case, I'd like cheesecake and apple pie.

7
00:00:30,543 --> 00:00:37,192
Then I want chocolate cake, roll cake, pancakes, and flapjacks.

8
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:39,953
You're being too greedy, Genta-kun.

9
00:00:43,453 --> 00:00:44,163
Huh?

10
00:00:44,643 --> 00:00:46,293
Hey, isn't that...?

11
00:00:46,873 --> 00:00:48,043
Is that real?

12
00:00:48,513 --> 00:00:49,673
Yeah, right.

13
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:12,823
This must be the place.

14
00:01:26,843 --> 00:01:28,492
Finally arriving after swaying back and forth,

15
00:01:28,493 --> 00:01:30,213
draw close to mysteries and begin deducing the truth!

16
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:31,962
The shadow of a woman moves through a ruined building!

17
00:01:31,963 --> 00:01:33,842
In the air is the smell of something sweet and a case!

18
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,412
Always determining the one truth

19
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:37,272
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

20
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:40,083
his name is Detective Conan!

21
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:15,693
"Ballad of the Woman Who Loved Cake!"

22
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:20,532
Pull yourselves together, guys.

23
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,193
What happened?

24
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:29,122
What? A corpse came back to life?

25
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:31,032
It's true, Conan!

26
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:33,432
A-A-A hand reached out from beneath the debris!

27
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:37,013
It started moving, and a woman wearing red emerged!

28
00:03:41,163 --> 00:03:44,893
Looks like that zombie is injured.

29
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:48,142
If we follow this trail of blood...

30
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:51,903
Then we'll learn the true identity of that lady zombie.

31
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:55,403
How far does this trail go, though?

32
00:03:56,963 --> 00:03:58,903
Huh? Isn't this place...

33
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:02,283
Western Confections Paradise.

34
00:04:02,523 --> 00:04:05,763
Huh? Isn't that woman...

35
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,532
Apparently there's a desolate building outside Haido City

36
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:12,923
where they're planning to establish a new factory for this bakery.

37
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:15,432
A desolate building? What's that?

38
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:18,923
An old building no longer in use by anyone.

39
00:04:19,273 --> 00:04:21,912
Sounds interesting. Let's check it out.

40
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:25,132
We don't have school next Thursday, so let's go then.

41
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:27,063
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

42
00:04:27,473 --> 00:04:28,393
Jeez.

43
00:04:34,393 --> 00:04:39,422
The same woman is in the same seat eating the same cake as last week.

44
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:41,242
She's pretty.

45
00:04:41,243 --> 00:04:46,322
Yeah, but she's wearing really dirty clothes.

46
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:47,402
Those stains...

47
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:50,213
Aren't they a similar color to that debris?

48
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,962
Then maybe...

49
00:04:51,963 --> 00:04:54,213
She's the lady zombie?

50
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,993
Thank you.

51
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,772
Her ankle is injured.

52
00:05:01,773 --> 00:05:03,723
It's gotta be her.

53
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,013
The lady zombie is angry.

54
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,043
After her!

55
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:16,443
Wait, Conan-kun!

56
00:05:30,643 --> 00:05:33,062
She entered a building.

57
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:37,223
This is Western Confections Paradise's main factory.

58
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:50,862
The doorman will never let us in.

59
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:52,012
What should we do?

60
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:53,822
We came this far.

61
00:05:53,823 --> 00:05:55,123
Hey, guys.

62
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:57,663
Over here.

63
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:13,182
What's the matter, Yayoi-san?

64
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:14,873
Th-The president!

65
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:21,253
Brother!

66
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:32,082
C-Call the police.

67
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,972
And let everyone in the office know about this.

68
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:37,203
Understood.

69
00:06:37,793 --> 00:06:40,192
I'll tell my wife.

70
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:41,063
Yes, sir.

71
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,913
This is my wife's handkerchief.

72
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:51,343
Could she have done this?

73
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:57,633
Hello? What's wrong?

74
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,472
What? The president's been murdered?

75
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:02,923
He drowned in red bean paste?

76
00:07:03,103 --> 00:07:05,913
Yes. Anyway, where are you now?

77
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,433
I see. In that case...

78
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:12,563
What? Let's have lunch at the apartment?

79
00:07:12,963 --> 00:07:15,992
Last night's leftover sukiyaki over rice?

80
00:07:15,993 --> 00:07:17,553
Yeah, that'll do.

81
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,153
See you later.

82
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,573
He's creating an alibi.

83
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:26,263
Could he have done this?

84
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:29,102
This has turned into a serious situation.

85
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:32,802
Do you think the lady zombie is connected to the case?

86
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:34,652
I don't know yet.

87
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:37,302
The Detective Boys are on the case.

88
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:38,702
What? Hey.

89
00:07:38,703 --> 00:07:41,072
Let's split up and gather information.

90
00:07:41,073 --> 00:07:41,803
Hey.

91
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:43,612
Conan, you watch the crime scene.

92
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:44,553
Wait.

93
00:07:44,554 --> 00:07:47,052
Detective Boys, roll out!

94
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:48,053
Yeah!

95
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:55,313
The deceased is Western Confections Paradise company president Ogawa Akira-san, 35 years old.

96
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,052
He apparently suffocated to death when his face

97
00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:00,802
was pushed into a sink filled with red bean paste.

98
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:03,282
What an eccentric murder.

99
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:06,573
Was the victim making a huge amount of red bean soup or something?

100
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:09,012
Despite being the president of a Western confections factory,

101
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:12,442
he apparently had become absorbed in Japanese sweet-making recently.

102
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:15,762
Imagine being killed by the red bean paste you made yourself.

103
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:18,583
Wh-What are you doing here?

104
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:21,602
I thought I'd assist with the investigation

105
00:08:21,603 --> 00:08:24,122
since I'm already here to pick up the kids as their guardian.

106
00:08:24,123 --> 00:08:26,343
So, where's the boy?

107
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:29,592
He was around here until a moment ago.

108
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:33,023
Inspector, I've brought the people who discovered the body.

109
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:39,233
I'm sorry to trouble you when you're already tired, but we have a few questions for you.

110
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:44,702
You're the victim Ogawa Akira-san's younger brother and Vice President Ogawa Hiroshi-san

111
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:48,243
and the president's secretary Ito Yayoi-san, correct?

112
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:51,672
The estimated time of death is 12PM.

113
00:08:51,673 --> 00:08:56,493
It's not that you're suspects, but where were you at that time?

114
00:08:56,773 --> 00:09:00,753
Around that time, I was crushed beneath some concrete.

115
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:03,992
What? C-Crushed beneath concrete?

116
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:06,682
At the ruined building where we're planning to build our new factory.

117
00:09:06,683 --> 00:09:07,753
Ruined building?

118
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:10,433
I was suppose to meet the president there.

119
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:13,642
We were going to elope.

120
00:09:13,643 --> 00:09:14,343
What?!

121
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:17,533
We were in love.

122
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:22,573
But... no matter how long I waited, the president never showed up.

123
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:28,012
I became overwhelmed by sadness and went on a violent rampage.

124
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:31,913
Then the concrete fell, crushing me beneath it.

125
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:38,262
Apparently I was unconscious for some time until I was awoken

126
00:09:38,263 --> 00:09:40,672
by the dreadful voices of the Detective Boys.

127
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:43,873
Those children can attest to what happened after that.

128
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:46,983
I should thank them.

129
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:51,712
So she knew we were following her.

130
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:54,383
Hiroshi-san, what were you doing around that time?

131
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:58,003
I returned to my apartment to have lunch with my wife.

132
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:01,563
We had last night's leftover sukiyaki over rice.

133
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:04,803
Conan-kun.

134
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:06,402
How'd it go?

135
00:10:06,403 --> 00:10:08,943
A lot of facts have come to light.

136
00:10:09,313 --> 00:10:15,022
The president was trying to develop Japanese sweets to sell at Western Confections Paradise,

137
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:18,952
but the VP was strongly opposed, which caused friction between them.

138
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,162
Hiroshi-san!

139
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,543
Ah, Hanako. Over here.

140
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,362
So, that's the VP's wife?

141
00:10:26,363 --> 00:10:27,043
Yes.

142
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:32,053
His wife sided with the VP and also opposed the president.

143
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:35,772
Ma'am, where were you around 12PM today?

144
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:37,803
I was at home with Hiroshi-san.

145
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:40,612
We were eating beef bowls for lunch.

146
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:43,813
She's matching her husband's lie and fabricating an alibi.

147
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:50,823
The VP and his wife both think the other did it and are protecting each other.

148
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:54,312
The VP's wife is a rude lady.

149
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:58,073
She bumped into me when she got out of her red car at the bottom of the steps.

150
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:04,453
But she smelled nice, like she'd just gotten out of the shower after shampooing her hair.

151
00:11:04,843 --> 00:11:07,553
A red car, shampoo...

152
00:11:08,113 --> 00:11:10,463
I got a bunch of information, too.

153
00:11:10,823 --> 00:11:15,712
Apparently the murdered president planned to convince the VP

154
00:11:15,713 --> 00:11:19,723
and his wife who opposed him and build a Japanese sweets factory in that ruined building.

155
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,792
The ruined building, debris...

156
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:27,942
Anyway, Ito-san, you seem to know a lot about the situation at your company

157
00:11:27,943 --> 00:11:30,733
and the condition of your employees.

158
00:11:30,993 --> 00:11:31,723
Yes.

159
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:37,532
Though my title is the president's secretary, I'm responsible for taking care of the entire company.

160
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:41,123
She always assists us with the details.

161
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:43,602
You know, that lady...

162
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,752
Isn't a zombie at all.

163
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:48,802
Yeah, she's an ordinary pretty lady.

164
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:55,732
Come to think of it, she said she was grateful your terrified voices woke her up.

165
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:56,833
What?

166
00:11:57,863 --> 00:11:59,082
The thing is...

167
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,252
It was actually...

168
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,643
The other way around.

169
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:02,873
The other way around?

170
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:05,172
She's not wrong.

171
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:07,372
We did scream in terror.

172
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:10,583
But it was because she came back to life.

173
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,833
Guys, tell me more about that.

174
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:24,163
Everyone, if you could please wait down below.

175
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:27,282
Confirm their alibis.

176
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:28,123
Yes, sir.

177
00:12:28,124 --> 00:12:32,043
Anyway, where did those kids go?

178
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,803
We need to discuss what we're going to do next.

179
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,932
You're right.

180
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:40,852
Let's hold an emergency meeting in your office.

181
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:42,592
Right now?

182
00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:44,803
The sooner, the better.

183
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:49,123
I'm sure we'll come up with a good solution while eating something sweet.

184
00:12:58,163 --> 00:13:00,453
Wh-What's wrong with that kid?

185
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:03,562
How did you get in here?

186
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:05,033
Hiroshi-san, wait!

187
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:14,503
What's your problem?

188
00:13:15,303 --> 00:13:17,253
Your wife didn't do it.

189
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:22,473
Vice President's Office

190
00:13:23,673 --> 00:13:26,032
Hiroshi-san, what was that about?

191
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:30,233
Apparently some kids had entered the woods,

192
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:32,452
but I couldn't find them.

193
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:35,983
It was probably the Detective Boys.

194
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:39,862
I need to contact someone regarding something.

195
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:42,162
You two go ahead and eat without me.

196
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:43,713
I'll be right back.

197
00:13:46,683 --> 00:13:49,543
Where did that kid go?

198
00:13:49,873 --> 00:13:51,182
Hey, you kids.

199
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:52,912
Hello.

200
00:13:52,913 --> 00:13:55,002
It's just you kids?

201
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:56,232
Where's four-eyes?

202
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,842
He went that way.

203
00:13:57,843 --> 00:13:59,553
That way? All right.

204
00:13:59,863 --> 00:14:02,212
Don't wander around too much, kids.

205
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:03,053
Okay.

206
00:14:03,513 --> 00:14:05,193
Hey, Detective Takagi.

207
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:09,152
Conan-kun?! Mori-san's been looking for you.

208
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:10,252
Yeah, sure.

209
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:15,182
Anyway, he said he wanted forensics to look into something for him.

210
00:14:15,183 --> 00:14:15,983
What?

211
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:20,083
Excuse me.

212
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:45,832
Oh, do the Detective Boys like cake as well?

213
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:46,852
Yeah.

214
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:47,763
I see.

215
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:50,783
I enjoy cake, too.

216
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:53,953
Or rather, I love it dearly.

217
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:57,153
I haven't thanked you yet.

218
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,592
Thanked us?

219
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:05,352
For testifying that you found me crushed beneath concrete in the ruined building.

220
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:08,432
Thank you, Detective Boys.

221
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:14,163
I sensed you fearfully entering the ruined building then.

222
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,553
We were laughing then.

223
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,563
Then a woman came back to life.

224
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:29,763
Oh, is that right?

225
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:35,433
You used the Detective Boys to fabricate an alibi.

226
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,193
Isn't that right?

227
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:39,553
What are you talking about?

228
00:15:40,193 --> 00:15:40,983
Hey!

229
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:43,452
I finally found you.

230
00:15:43,453 --> 00:15:49,913
How dare you wandering around the crime scene like some little wandering...

231
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,863
Hey! He's so heavy...

232
00:15:53,643 --> 00:15:57,913
This case is the sad ballad of a woman who loves cake.

233
00:15:58,203 --> 00:16:01,432
The sad ballad of a woman who loves cake?

234
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:03,112
What is this old dude talking about?

235
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:05,922
Wait, where is his voice coming from?

236
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,433
Listen to what I have to say as we dance a waltz together.

237
00:16:09,673 --> 00:16:10,683
What?!

238
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:15,482
They're...

239
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:16,933
...dancing a waltz.

240
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:23,313
This ballad began one week ago at the Western Confections Paradise cake shop in Haido City,

241
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:29,563
when the woman who loves cake learned of the Detective Boys' plan to explore a ruined building.

242
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:35,033
This morning, the woman who loves cake went to said ruined building.

243
00:16:35,673 --> 00:16:38,052
Using a long thread and plywood boards,

244
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:41,573
she rigged some debris to fall automatically.

245
00:16:42,683 --> 00:16:46,343
Conan found signs of this contrivance in the ruined structure.

246
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:50,093
On the path between the ruined building and Western Confections Paradise,

247
00:16:50,363 --> 00:16:55,603
she left a trail of blood beforehand so the Detective Boys would follow it.

248
00:16:56,363 --> 00:17:00,852
She returned to the office and waited for the right moment to speak to the VP's wife.

249
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,292
I'm sorry.

250
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:06,402
The president forgot some documents at the new factory site.

251
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:07,503
No problem.

252
00:17:09,203 --> 00:17:13,073
The VP's wife headed to the ruined building in a red car,

253
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:17,793
where she triggered the tripwire and was crushed beneath the debris.

254
00:17:18,293 --> 00:17:19,303
And then...

255
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:26,312
Awoken by the laughter of the Detective Boys who had arrived,

256
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:30,893
she failed to notice their presence and hastily left out of fear.

257
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:37,073
At that time, Conan saw a red car driving down the hill.

258
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:41,872
Since the VP's wife didn't return to the office until after the murder,

259
00:17:41,873 --> 00:17:45,703
she must've returned home and taken a shower.

260
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:48,983
Meanwhile, the woman who loves cake

261
00:17:49,553 --> 00:17:52,173
headed to the president's office as though nothing had happened.

262
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:55,103
She waited for an opportunity to kill the president,

263
00:17:57,093 --> 00:18:02,663
left behind the VP's wife's handkerchief she'd stolen beforehand, and left.

264
00:18:03,673 --> 00:18:06,712
The VP and his wife suspected each other.

265
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:12,362
The lies they told ultimately fabricated an alibi for the woman who loves cake.

266
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:14,382
For the woman who loves cake,

267
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:19,412
predicting the VP and his wife's actions and manipulating them was a simple task.

268
00:18:19,413 --> 00:18:21,063
After all, she's the secretary.

269
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:24,593
Then the woman who loves cake waited.

270
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:29,573
She wore clothes similar to the VP's wife, stained her ankle with blood,

271
00:18:30,063 --> 00:18:32,153
and ate cake while she waited,

272
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:35,473
as though waiting for a lover,

273
00:18:36,563 --> 00:18:39,093
for the Detective Boys to follow the trail.

274
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:46,342
And that's how the Detective Boys were used to fabricate an alibi

275
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:47,923
for the sad woman who loves cake.

276
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,312
Why are you looking at me like that?

277
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:54,352
What proof is there that I killed the president?

278
00:18:54,353 --> 00:18:58,223
This is all just the nonsensical reasoning of an old dude who reeks of cigarettes!

279
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,893
You're right. There's no evidence.

280
00:19:01,113 --> 00:19:02,143
See? Told you so.

281
00:19:02,303 --> 00:19:05,642
But what about the VP and his wife's testimony?

282
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:07,272
There's no such testimony.

283
00:19:07,273 --> 00:19:12,153
What makes the woman who loves cake say that?

284
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:12,933
What?

285
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:14,212
On what basis do you make that claim?

286
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:17,783
What basis? None, it's just what I think.

287
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:19,533
No, there is something.

288
00:19:19,683 --> 00:19:22,043
This old dude who reeks of cigarettes knows.

289
00:19:22,283 --> 00:19:23,793
He admitted it?!

290
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:25,792
What are you claiming to know?

291
00:19:25,793 --> 00:19:30,793
I know the woman who loves cake poisoned the VP and his wife and tried to kill them.

292
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,303
I've had enough of you!

293
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:35,602
Now you've said it! How dare you!

294
00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:36,553
Stay away from me!

295
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:38,362
Get off of me!

296
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:41,553
A murderer has no right to speak to me that way.

297
00:19:43,563 --> 00:19:45,563
But don't worry.

298
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:46,653
What?

299
00:19:46,654 --> 00:19:49,482
What do you see on the other side of that glass?

300
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:51,313
The glass? What?

301
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:58,833
B-But how?

302
00:19:59,353 --> 00:20:01,243
I told them.

303
00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:03,953
The culprit is the secretary.

304
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:10,253
I had them pretend to be poisoned without eating the matcha cake.

305
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:14,753
The police told me earlier that they found poison in the cake.

306
00:20:20,103 --> 00:20:23,212
And so, the ballad of the woman who loves cake

307
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:26,333
ended with her betrayal by the cake she loves.

308
00:20:32,413 --> 00:20:34,773
I couldn't forgive the president.

309
00:20:35,753 --> 00:20:41,283
How could my beloved Western Confections Paradise make Japanese sweets of all things?

310
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:43,832
At first, they opposed the idea,

311
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:48,333
but the VP and his wife were just as guilty for accepting the president's suggestion.

312
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:53,793
Western Confections Paradise was my dream.

313
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,252
And my precious Western Confections Paradise

314
00:20:57,253 --> 00:21:01,303
needed to be a paradise of Western confections, true to its name.

315
00:21:01,913 --> 00:21:05,522
Shortcake, mont blanc, cheesecake.

316
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:08,073
My beloved Western sweets.

317
00:21:08,713 --> 00:21:12,413
Apple pie, chocolate cake, éclairs.

318
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:16,333
A paradise of Western sweets.

319
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:20,532
We heard everything.

320
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:21,863
Ito Yayoi-san.

321
00:21:25,163 --> 00:21:27,513
Could you tell us more about that elsewhere?

322
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:29,063
Ito-san?

323
00:21:29,573 --> 00:21:31,963
Cream puff and maritozzo.

324
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:34,113
Shortcake.

325
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:38,913
Cheesecake, apple pie, chocolate cake.

326
00:21:40,053 --> 00:21:41,473
Mont blanc, too.

327
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:42,832
Ito-san.

328
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,282
Ito Yayoi-san, is that all right?

329
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:46,863
We'd like to speak with you.

330
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:48,473
Yes.

331
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:50,393
I understand.

332
00:21:52,753 --> 00:21:59,153
I wanted to create a true paradise of Western sweets.

333
00:23:27,013 --> 00:23:30,463
So they're making a Japanese sweets factory instead of a cake factory.

334
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,622
Daifuku.

335
00:23:32,623 --> 00:23:34,052
Dorayaki.

336
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:35,312
Kintsuba.

337
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,623
Amanatto.

338
00:23:36,913 --> 00:23:38,322
Potato yokan.

339
00:23:38,323 --> 00:23:39,782
Soft yokan.

340
00:23:39,783 --> 00:23:41,312
Steamed yokan.

341
00:23:41,313 --> 00:23:43,263
Goodbye, building. Now you're gone.

342
00:23:48,673 --> 00:23:50,012
I'm the foundation.

343
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,393
My friends are on their way to assist me.

344
00:23:52,593 --> 00:23:54,893
You've been spacing out a lot recently.

345
00:23:55,443 --> 00:23:56,973
I told him to eat shit.

346
00:23:57,593 --> 00:23:58,473
Bingo!

347
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:07,173
This is the story of a group of new police recruits who joined the academy in the spring.

348
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:14,823
The next episode of Conan is "Police Academy Arc Wild Police Story CASE. Matsuda Jinpei!"
