1
00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:05,525
March 14th is White Day.

2
00:00:05,525 --> 00:00:07,625
Talking about White Day,

3
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:10,025
did you receive anything, Ran?

4
00:00:10,025 --> 00:00:12,425
A gift in return from Shinichi.

5
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:19,425
You gave him hand-made Valentine's chocolate too, didn't you, Ran?

6
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:21,325
Well, I did sort of give it to him.

7
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:24,025
Or rather, he ate it without permission.

8
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:29,025
I wonder if Kygyoku's going to give me something,

9
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:30,825
in return on White Day.

10
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:32,725
If you give somebody chocolate on Valentine's Day,

11
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:35,925
you get a return gift on March 14th!

12
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:39,025
First, you casually give him a Valentine's Day gift

13
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:41,225
and exactly a month afterwards on March 14th,

14
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:42,725
if he gives you a gift in return,

15
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:46,325
the bells of days of romance after romance will resound.

16
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:47,925
But, if you get nothing, then the footsteps of broken love

17
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:49,925
will close in.

18
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,225
Footsteps of broken love?

19
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,625
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

20
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,025
Tears are start of all dramas.

21
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,725
Sour tasting White Day.

22
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:01,825
Solve the miracle trick!

23
00:01:01,825 --> 00:01:03,525
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:05,425
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:08,225
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:48,743 --> 00:02:51,543
We were invited to the 8th Anniversary party

27
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:53,943
of the establishment of Urai Confections.

28
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:57,343
Every year on the anniversary of his company's establishment day,

29
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,643
President Urai puts on a performance, such as magic shows and skits

30
00:02:58,643 --> 00:02:59,943
to entertain his guests,

31
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:03,943
and everyone waits in anticipation.

32
00:03:05,943 --> 00:03:10,443
However, President Urai lets out a loud groan and collapses to the floor.

33
00:03:10,443 --> 00:03:13,643
Everyone thinks that he's acting out a mystery skit this year,

34
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:15,943
but the president actually dies.

35
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:19,143
Although it is concluded that

36
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:21,343
he died potassium cyanide poisoning,

37
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:24,443
the president's wife Hoshie, who was nearest to him

38
00:03:24,443 --> 00:03:26,343
was reading Ran's palm at the time,

39
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:28,543
and could not have administered the poison.

40
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,543
A bottle of poison and wafers are discovered

41
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:34,343
from inside the president's car.

42
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:36,143
This increases the possibility of him

43
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:39,043
having committed suicide because as Hoshie explains,

44
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:42,543
they were contemplating a divorce as well as splitting the company up.

45
00:03:42,543 --> 00:03:44,343
However...

46
00:03:46,443 --> 00:03:49,443
"White Day of Betrayal (Part 2)".

47
00:03:52,643 --> 00:03:53,843
Mrs. Urai.

48
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:57,643
I think you should hurry up and call the store.

49
00:03:57,643 --> 00:03:58,743
What?

50
00:03:58,743 --> 00:04:01,243
Because all you and the president

51
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:05,743
were doing at the party was drinking, and not eat.

52
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:07,643
So, I'm sure you reserved to have dinner

53
00:04:07,643 --> 00:04:10,043
at a high-class restaurant or something, right?

54
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:12,343
I have no reservation.

55
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:14,243
"Hoshie Urai (49)" -To get my husband's metabolism going,

56
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:16,243
"Taruto Urai's wife" -eating dinner out was a no-no.

57
00:04:16,243 --> 00:04:20,843
I made healthy meals for him every day.

58
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,543
I see.

59
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:25,143
What was the menu for tonight, then?

60
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:29,443
Well, I wonder what it was.

61
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:32,243
This party ends at 21:00.

62
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:35,943
And if you see the guests off, it'll be later,

63
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:39,943
so you must've bought the ingredients already, right?

64
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:42,043
You couldn't have known beforehand

65
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:44,243
that something like this was going to happen, right?

66
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,943
What the...

67
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:49,543
What's with this child?

68
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:56,343
There's no doubt that she's the killer.

69
00:04:56,343 --> 00:04:59,343
But, how did she administer the poison?

70
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:00,843
When the president collapsed,

71
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,243
Mrs. Urai was definitely reading Ran's palm

72
00:05:03,243 --> 00:05:05,643
and both of her hands were full.

73
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:07,243
If she were to set something up,

74
00:05:07,243 --> 00:05:12,243
it would've been the words that she mumbled, "Is it working?".

75
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:15,743
But, what could she make him do with those words?

76
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:20,943
What? Do you have pollen allergy, Officer Chiba?

77
00:05:20,943 --> 00:05:23,743
Yes. I drank medicine,

78
00:05:23,743 --> 00:05:25,243
but doesn't seem to be working.

79
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:29,643
And, if I drink too much, I'll get sleepy.

80
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:31,243
Working?

81
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:33,043
I wish there was a miracle pollen allergy drug

82
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:37,543
that won't make you sleepy even if you drink it.

83
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:39,243
Miracle?

84
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:42,443
Have them hurry on checking the poison and wafers

85
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,543
that were found in the victim's car.

86
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:45,543
Yes, sir!

87
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:48,943
Oh, no! Dad's cigarette is on the table!

88
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:53,243
Oh no, the paper napkin is burnt!

89
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:56,243
But, I'm sure glad that nothing caught fire.

90
00:05:56,243 --> 00:05:57,543
My God.

91
00:05:57,543 --> 00:06:01,543
That's the paper napkin that came with Mrs. Urai's iced lemon tea.

92
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:06,243
I see.

93
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:09,543
That's why Mrs. Urai deliberately went pass there.

94
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:13,143
Hey, Officer Takagi!

95
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:15,343
I want you to look for what Pops asked me

96
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:17,843
to tell you to look for.

97
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:20,343
Look for what?

98
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:25,443
The evidence for the miracle trick the culprit tried to hide.

99
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:32,243
The cause of my husband's death

100
00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:36,043
is acute drug poisoning due to cyanide compounds.

101
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:37,243
If anyone could administer the poison to him,

102
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:39,343
it would be me.

103
00:06:39,343 --> 00:06:41,343
However, at that time, I was holding Ran's left hand

104
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:44,743
with both my hands and reading her palms,

105
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:47,743
so I couldn't have given him the poison using my hands.

106
00:06:47,743 --> 00:06:49,743
Moreover, a container with poison and wafers

107
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:53,243
were found in my husband's car.

108
00:06:53,243 --> 00:06:58,943
On top of that, a wafer was stuck between his molar.

109
00:06:58,943 --> 00:07:00,443
Which means, my husband had the poison wrapped in the wafer

110
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:01,943
and was holding it.

111
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:05,743
So, during the party he drank it and committed suicide.

112
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:08,443
That's the only thing thinkable, no?

113
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:10,043
I guess so.

114
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:15,343
Then, won't you please let the people who came to the party go?

115
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:18,343
Besides, I've been cleared of suspicion too.

116
00:07:18,343 --> 00:07:21,043
In the first place, if I were the killer,

117
00:07:21,043 --> 00:07:25,243
I wouldn't invite a great detective like Mr. Mouri to a place

118
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:27,143
that I would plan on committing a crime at.

119
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:29,443
True.

120
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:33,543
If that were to be one of your strategies, though...

121
00:07:33,543 --> 00:07:35,843
it would be a different story.

122
00:07:37,143 --> 00:07:40,843
No, that wasn't me, you see.

123
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:42,343
Hold it.

124
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:45,043
When I hear my own voice coming from someplace else.

125
00:07:45,043 --> 00:07:47,743
I always feel a prick on my neck.

126
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:51,543
Come to think of it,

127
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:55,443
there are times I feel it on my forehead.

128
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:56,843
Don't tell me, Dad,

129
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,943
that the usual has come?

130
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:00,843
Hey, Mr. Mouri.

131
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:02,843
What does he mean by strategy?

132
00:08:04,343 --> 00:08:09,143
Of course, strategy to carry out the murder trick.

133
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:13,443
In order for her to poison her husband, President Urai to death.

134
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,243
Strategy?

135
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:26,543
Are you saying that I used you, Mr. Mouri?

136
00:08:26,543 --> 00:08:27,743
Yes.

137
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:29,443
The one who was actually used

138
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:33,243
was my daughter, Ran, who accompanied me here, though.

139
00:08:33,243 --> 00:08:35,943
If she testifies that both your hands were full

140
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:38,343
because you were palm reading Ran,

141
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:43,043
and that your husband didn't move after he collapsed.

142
00:08:43,043 --> 00:08:45,143
I would, more than anyone else believe her,

143
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:47,743
and you would be cleared off the list of suspects.

144
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:51,543
You committed the crime during my speech

145
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:54,943
because you wanted to keep me away at the podium,

146
00:08:54,943 --> 00:08:58,543
so that I wouldn't by chance see through your trick.

147
00:08:58,543 --> 00:09:01,343
So, just what kind of trick was it?

148
00:09:01,343 --> 00:09:04,343
What could I have done back then?

149
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,243
You called out to your husband, didn't you?

150
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:09,743
You asked him, "Is it working?".

151
00:09:09,743 --> 00:09:11,543
So, that was...

152
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:16,543
President Urai was a flashy character who liked to perform magic or skits.

153
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,943
Moreover, he hated sour things.

154
00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:24,643
I'll bet you conned him in this way, Mrs. Urai.

155
00:09:24,643 --> 00:09:27,543
"I think that everyone will be surprised if you eat the Spy Choco White

156
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:30,443
that is really sour without changing your facial expression

157
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:34,243
at the next party." Isn't that right?

158
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:36,043
Don't be silly.

159
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:38,843
My husband got sick eating a sour cake

160
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:41,143
just the other day, you know?

161
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:44,743
So, there is no way my husband could eat that chocolate.

162
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:48,743
There's a very miracle trick!

163
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:58,455
Miracle trick?

164
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:02,455
You know of the miracle fruit, don't you?

165
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:03,655
I know of it.

166
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:07,255
It's the berry that changes sour things to sweet when you eat it.

167
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:09,655
It was popular some years ago.

168
00:10:09,655 --> 00:10:11,455
It's a small red berry

169
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:15,355
originally from West Africa that works on the taste buds

170
00:10:15,355 --> 00:10:17,855
and changes sour-tasting things to sweet temporarily

171
00:10:17,855 --> 00:10:20,855
that includes miraculin, a glycoprotein.

172
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:23,355
It is indeed a miracle fruit.

173
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:25,655
If you roll it carefully over your tongue,

174
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:28,155
the effect keeps for 1-2 hours.

175
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:33,755
That's why Mrs. Urai, you gave the berry to the president beforehand

176
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:38,455
and asked him "Is the miracle fruit still working?", right?

177
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:41,355
Then, don't tell me that the poison was...

178
00:10:41,355 --> 00:10:42,355
Yes.

179
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:48,655
The thing most suitable that was on the table back then for testing

180
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:49,755
was the lemon slice

181
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:53,455
on the glass cup of the lemon tea the Mrs. Urai was drinking.

182
00:10:53,455 --> 00:10:57,255
Mr. Urai cut off a part of the fruit beforehand

183
00:10:57,255 --> 00:11:02,955
and put poison wrapped in a wafer into the cut portion of the fruit.

184
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,055
So that when the president put it in his mouth,

185
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:07,955
the poison would melt in his mouth.

186
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:09,155
In other words,

187
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:12,955
Mrs. Urai wrapped the lemon that she put the poison inside with something,

188
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:15,955
snuck it in her pocket and entered the hall.

189
00:11:15,955 --> 00:11:17,755
Then she switched the lemon on the iced lemon tea that she picked up

190
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:19,855
with the poisoned lemon.

191
00:11:19,855 --> 00:11:23,055
She sandwiched the original lemon in between a paper napkin and hid it,

192
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:25,455
then waited for my speech.

193
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:30,455
And along with the remark she made, and after the president collapsed,

194
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:31,655
she swiftly took the poisoned lemon

195
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:33,555
that was in the president's mouth out and hid it.

196
00:11:33,555 --> 00:11:37,155
While everyone's attention was focused on the president,

197
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,555
she switched the original lemon

198
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:40,355
that was sandwiched between the paper napkin

199
00:11:40,355 --> 00:11:43,555
back into the glass cup again.

200
00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:44,855
This way,

201
00:11:44,855 --> 00:11:47,855
even if the police came back later and checked,

202
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:51,955
no poison would be found from on top of the table.

203
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:56,155
By the way, when you first picked up the iced lemon tea,

204
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:59,455
you deliberately chose a cup from the third row

205
00:11:59,455 --> 00:12:02,455
because you wanted to choose one with a lemon

206
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,555
of the same size as the one you had.

207
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:06,255
Am I wrong?

208
00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:14,055
Just as would be expected of you, great detective.

209
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:17,055
You're very observant up to the minutest detail.

210
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:21,055
But, I chose that glass cup out of mere habit.

211
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:22,955
Haven't you done it too?

212
00:12:22,955 --> 00:12:24,355
To pick not the one in the foreground,

213
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:27,355
but the one in back.

214
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:28,655
I have!

215
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:31,255
When I buy milk at the convenience store, I always do so.

216
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:34,555
Besides, if my husband took the lemon from my glass cup

217
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:36,055
and put it into his mouth,

218
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,655
I'm sure someone would've been watching.

219
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:41,555
No, I don't think anyone was watching.

220
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:43,555
Because I'm sure that the president himself

221
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:47,255
made sure that no one saw him do so.

222
00:12:47,255 --> 00:12:50,755
If somebody sees him looking alright eating something sour,

223
00:12:50,755 --> 00:12:54,155
he wouldn't be able to surprise them.

224
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:56,755
But, as for the evidence of the original lemon

225
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,755
that you sandwiched between the paper napkin,

226
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:02,155
the forensic officer has it with him.

227
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:06,955
A while ago, when I deliberately threw my cigarette down,

228
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:09,055
the paper napkin that I burnt, is it.

229
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:13,355
Is that true, forensics officer?

230
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:16,055
Yes, this is it.

231
00:13:16,055 --> 00:13:19,355
Please take a good look at that paper napkin.

232
00:13:19,355 --> 00:13:21,255
The straight burnt line that extends

233
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:24,355
is arched part way, isn't it?

234
00:13:24,355 --> 00:13:27,555
That's proof that the lemon was there.

235
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:29,155
In the same way that heat-fixed invisible ink works.

236
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:31,955
Only that part burns easily.

237
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:36,155
Then, where is the poisoned lemon?

238
00:13:36,155 --> 00:13:38,455
I body checked Mrs. Urai,

239
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:40,155
but didn't find any lemon on her.

240
00:13:40,155 --> 00:13:42,055
It's most likely that

241
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,255
after taking the poisoned lemon out of the president's mouth

242
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:45,555
after he collapsed,

243
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:48,355
she hid it in between her shoe or something for the time being.

244
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:50,255
When going to get a body check,

245
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:53,755
she passed beside the table with the glass cups line out.

246
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:57,555
And she deliberately dropped the iced lemon tea glasses to the floor.

247
00:13:57,555 --> 00:13:59,755
She pretended to sprain her ankle,

248
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,055
removed the lemon from her shoe

249
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:04,455
and mixed it among the lemons on the floor.

250
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:05,655
I see.

251
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:08,655
-Then, retrieve that lemon. -Yes, sir.

252
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:10,655
No.

253
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:12,255
I've already found it

254
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:13,855
because Mr. Mouri asked me to look for it.

255
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:15,955
The lemon that had a part of it cut out,

256
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,055
that had a slight toxic reaction.

257
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:21,455
If the president's saliva

258
00:14:21,455 --> 00:14:24,155
as well as the fingerprints of Mr. and Mrs. Urai are found on it...

259
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,155
-It would be conclusive evidence. -Yes.

260
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:33,755
It was a grudge against sour flavor,

261
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:35,855
so I chose a lemon.

262
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:38,155
But, it didn't work after all.

263
00:14:38,155 --> 00:14:40,055
It's so difficult to hide.

264
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:43,255
Grudge against sour flavor?

265
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:44,555
Yes.

266
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:48,155
I met my husband at confectionary school.

267
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:49,755
My husband was a teacher

268
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,955
and I was a student.

269
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:55,755
On a certain day, after several years have passed...

270
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:59,555
Two people were to enter a sweets making contest from that school,

271
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:02,455
and I was chosen as one of them.

272
00:15:02,455 --> 00:15:06,055
But, it was obvious who would be champion even before entering.

273
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:08,455
It was already obvious that the other boy from our school

274
00:15:08,455 --> 00:15:10,855
was going to win.

275
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:14,955
The sour-tasting sweets that he made were truly superb.

276
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:19,055
People from abroad also came to head hunt him.

277
00:15:19,055 --> 00:15:20,555
However...

278
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,755
Who would've thought he would commit suicide a day before the contest.

279
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:30,055
Back then,

280
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:33,655
I thought he had worries that got to him because of his genius talent,

281
00:15:33,655 --> 00:15:38,055
so I did my best and won the championship.

282
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:40,855
Then, why did you say a while ago, that you came in second?

283
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:46,055
Yes, because if he were there, I wouldn't have won.

284
00:15:46,055 --> 00:15:47,855
Then, several years later,

285
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:50,655
I married my husband who was very happy

286
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:53,955
that I won the contest.

287
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:58,155
With that man who drove my boyfriend to his death.

288
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:00,755
Drove your boyfriend to death?

289
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:06,755
The other day, my husband who got sick over the sour cake confessed

290
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:08,455
that he hated sour flavor

291
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:10,555
because it reminded him of my boyfriend.

292
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:16,355
My husband after eating the pie that my boyfriend made before the contest

293
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:19,055
seems to have told him...

294
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:20,655
It's too sour.

295
00:16:20,655 --> 00:16:22,655
Are you sure your tongue's okay?

296
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:24,655
Like so.

297
00:16:24,655 --> 00:16:27,255
Since he trusted my husband completely,

298
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:31,255
he had a nervous breakdown and took his own life.

299
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:33,755
My husband cried and said that

300
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:36,355
it was to make me win

301
00:16:36,355 --> 00:16:39,255
or that he didn't think the man would die.

302
00:16:44,155 --> 00:16:49,855
He wasn't aware of how much we both loved each other.

303
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:01,255
You're really something, Mr. Mouri.

304
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:04,955
I had no idea that you deliberately threw down your cigarette.

305
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:07,355
Oh, well...

306
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:09,255
Deliberatelsy?

307
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:11,755
Well, today is White Day,

308
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:14,855
so I thought it'd be better to make everything clear, black or white.

309
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,555
White Day?

310
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:19,055
I guess I'll call Midori.

311
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:28,355
Midori? It's me.

312
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:33,055
My, Mr. Devil Inspector who loves criminal cases than you love your wife.

313
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:35,055
Just what did you want with me?

314
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:38,055
Hey! Don't tell me that you're drunk.

315
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:42,655
How'd you expect me not to get drunk? You octopus head!

316
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:48,755
Listen well.

317
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:50,555
In the cabinet next to the refrigerator

318
00:17:50,555 --> 00:17:51,655
on the second from the top shelf...

319
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:58,055
I was actually planning to give it to you after I got home today,

320
00:17:58,055 --> 00:17:59,955
but it seems I going to be late coming home tonight too, so...

321
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,155
"To Midori" -Well, it's just a little something from me.

322
00:18:05,155 --> 00:18:08,055
I hope you like it.

323
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:12,155
Oh, and I haven't eaten lunch or dinner today,

324
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:14,255
so I'd like you to have something ready for me.

325
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:15,855
Yes, sir!

326
00:18:21,155 --> 00:18:26,455
Ran, I'm going to have to go to interrogation after this,

327
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:28,155
so have Officer Takagi take you home.

328
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:31,155
-Okay. -And, while you're at it...

329
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:34,955
Stop by at Eri's and drop this off for me.

330
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:40,055
No joke! A White Day gift?

331
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:42,055
Don't... don't get me wrong!

332
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,355
I actually got this for Yoko but didn't get to give it to her

333
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:46,555
and I didn't want it to go to waste.

334
00:18:46,555 --> 00:18:48,255
Sure, sure.

335
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:52,255
The wrapper is obviously different from that of Yoko's.

336
00:18:55,655 --> 00:18:58,555
I wonder if Aunty Eri wasn't happy.

337
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,155
Her face looked a bit tense.

338
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:02,655
She's fine.

339
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:05,055
She was holding back wanting to smile.

340
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:08,055
It's proof that she's really happy.

341
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:10,555
And in the meantime, Officer Takagi was...

342
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:14,455
This is odd. The roads around here...

343
00:19:14,455 --> 00:19:16,455
I think I'm lost.

344
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,355
Just look at the car navigator.

345
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:21,655
You know, the car navigator of this car

346
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:24,155
is recently not working too well.

347
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:27,755
No hope,

348
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:29,655
I guess I'll use the map and navigate you then.

349
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:33,155
What's the street number for the Mouri Detective Agency?

350
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:34,855
Five-chome.

351
00:19:34,855 --> 00:19:36,455
How bothersome.

352
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:40,555
"To Miwako"

353
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:44,055
Hooray! I got my gift for White Day!

354
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:46,555
I mean, at least check

355
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:48,755
the glove compartment of your car, will you?

356
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:52,455
It's been in there from 3 days ago.

357
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:54,555
"Mouri Detective Agency"

358
00:19:55,055 --> 00:19:57,155
Officer Sato was really happy, wasn't she?

359
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,955
Yeah.

360
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:01,955
You see, Ran...

361
00:20:01,955 --> 00:20:03,755
Don't worry.

362
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:08,955
Shinichi is not the type to be concerned about White Day,

363
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:10,655
so I'll just forget about it, talking with Sonoko

364
00:20:10,655 --> 00:20:12,455
for a long time on the phone.

365
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:18,355
It's text mail from Sonoko.

366
00:20:18,355 --> 00:20:19,555
I wonder what it is.

367
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:25,455
I got a White Day gift in return from Makoto!

368
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:28,955
He said he got a white star mark of victory for me!

369
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:36,055
Oh, no. What shall I do?

370
00:20:36,055 --> 00:20:40,955
I can't call Sonoko up anymore.

371
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:20,355
Look.

372
00:22:22,055 --> 00:22:24,855
There something in the door post box!

373
00:22:24,855 --> 00:22:27,255
Was there anything in here before we left?

374
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:31,055
Don't tell me, it's from Shinichi?

375
00:22:38,555 --> 00:22:42,155
"Beika Tax Office" -It can't be.

376
00:22:44,055 --> 00:22:45,955
What could it be?

377
00:22:45,955 --> 00:22:47,655
Did I fail to put something in?

378
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:52,855
The deadline for submission of tax forms is March 15th.

379
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:54,255
It's tomorrow!

380
00:22:55,355 --> 00:22:57,855
"White Cough Drops"

381
00:22:57,855 --> 00:22:59,355
Cough drops?

382
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:02,155
Shinichi?

383
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:03,855
When I called you last time,

384
00:23:03,855 --> 00:23:05,955
you sounded nasal,

385
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:08,055
so lick this and get well soon.

386
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,655
White Day...

387
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:15,555
I know I shouldn't be expecting anything in return.

388
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:18,355
But receiving something in return

389
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,955
makes me feel as if my feelings have reached him.

390
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:33,455
It sure makes me happy.

391
00:23:35,955 --> 00:23:38,355
"Mouri Detective Agency"

392
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:43,055
Hey, Makoto.

393
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,555
Sonoko.

394
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:46,755
I'm in the midst of interviewing the victorious team.

395
00:23:46,755 --> 00:23:49,855
You mean there's no marshmallow or anything for White Day?

396
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:52,955
Yes, later, right away.

397
00:23:52,955 --> 00:23:54,755
It's White Day

398
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:56,955
and still things can get "black" and gloomy.

399
00:23:58,055 --> 00:24:01,255
"Next Episode" -Do you know that about five years ago,

400
00:24:01,255 --> 00:24:05,455
an extremely rich elderly man named Tsunechika Inubuchi passed away?

401
00:24:05,455 --> 00:24:07,155
Fight over inheritance...

402
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,155
One of the adopted children

403
00:24:09,155 --> 00:24:11,355
is an acquaintance of Kazuha's mother

404
00:24:11,355 --> 00:24:14,955
who has a very funny name.

405
00:24:18,855 --> 00:24:20,355
It's a demon dog!

406
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:22,555
Demon dogs really do exists!

407
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:23,855
Next Conan,

408
00:24:23,855 --> 00:24:27,155
"The Victim is Shinichi Kudo".

409
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:45,955
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:45,955 --> 00:24:47,555
"Portable charcoal stove".

411
00:24:47,555 --> 00:24:48,955
What? Shinichi is the victim?

412
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:50,355
No, I don't think it's the Shinichi we know.

413
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,855
-How do you know? -Well...
