1
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:25,569
Hide!

2
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:31,469
I did it! How about it?

3
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:36,968
Oh, no...

4
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:38,169
That's it.

5
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:44,468
It hurts...

6
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:46,169
Thank you.

7
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:49,868
You failed to sterilize (Inspect and verify safety) the room.

8
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:51,568
Minus 20 points!

9
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:52,868
You put the Marutai (The person who needed to be protected)

10
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:54,468
in the room alone.

11
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:56,168
Minus 30 points!

12
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:58,568
You confronted and fought the Maruhi (The suspect without authorization).

13
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:00,268
Minus 20 points!

14
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:03,168
On top of that you overlooked the other suspect.

15
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:04,768
Minus 20 points!

16
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,268
Consequently, the Marutai died.

17
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:11,168
Maximum minus point, that's not even worth evaluating!

18
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:12,768
Therefore...

19
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:14,268
"Arimasa Dobashi (45)" -You've failed.

20
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:16,868
How many times do I have to tell you, Mr. Mouri?

21
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,668
You're currently not a police detective nor a detective.

22
00:01:19,669 --> 00:01:22,568
Your sole job is to protect the life of the Marutai,

23
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:25,468
not to defend the law nor practice justice!

24
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:29,368
Absolutely. I'm ashamed of myself.

25
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:30,768
Let me try once more!

26
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:33,268
Rather, please!

27
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:34,668
Good for you!

28
00:01:34,669 --> 00:01:36,568
Everyone, standby!

29
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:37,969
Great!

30
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,868
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

31
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,868
Love and cases come from the same origin.

32
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:45,568
Many things are suspicious at a location for a drama.

33
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:47,968
Close call, bodyguard Pops.

34
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:49,568
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,368
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:53,969
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:40,228
"Bodyguard, Kogoro Mouri."

38
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:51,328
"Reina Sawasaki (28), Actress."

39
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:53,627
"Chisato Arimura (25), Nichiuri TV Assistant Director."

40
00:03:53,628 --> 00:03:56,627
Here you go, Reina. It's coffee.

41
00:03:56,628 --> 00:03:59,927
"Kenzo Kushizaki (45)" -Well... I wish you would do something about it.

42
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:01,827
Okay?

43
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:05,928
"Hideo Isokawa (40), Nichiuri TV Director."

44
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:11,727
But is it really okay?

45
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:14,327
For only us to come along with all of you.

46
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:18,127
I can't have my bodyguard riding in another car, can I?

47
00:04:18,128 --> 00:04:21,228
"Ryo Haneki (40), Actress" -I could really be killed next time.

48
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,228
I...

49
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:33,927
I went out of my way to ask you,

50
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:36,927
the famed Detective Mouri to serve as my bodyguard

51
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:39,227
because simultaneous to protecting me,

52
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:40,527
I want you to find out who's trying to kill me

53
00:04:40,528 --> 00:04:43,127
with your fantastic skill of deduction.

54
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:45,727
Of course, you can count on me.

55
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:48,827
That's the very reason I trained with the security company

56
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:52,127
affiliated with your agency.

57
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:54,228
But, why are they...

58
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:59,327
You must all be thirsty.

59
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:00,527
Please help yourselves.

60
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:04,027
"Kazuya Kusumoto (35)" -It's Ryo Haneki's special vegetable juice.

61
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:05,727
Thank you very much.

62
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:07,128
Thank you.

63
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:09,527
Dramas are a different story,

64
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:11,227
but I've actually got a lot of free time.

65
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,227
I'm glad I found somebody to keep me company talking.

66
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:16,327
That's for us to say!

67
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:19,027
We just came to watch and yet we get to travel together

68
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:22,727
with the great actress, Ryo Haneki.

69
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:24,327
Right, Conan?

70
00:05:24,328 --> 00:05:25,428
Yes.

71
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,328
"Lake Nakajima."

72
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:41,628
"Auberge Muto."

73
00:05:42,028 --> 00:05:44,827
Thank you for coming, everyone.

74
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:47,827
"Kimie Muto (30), Shohei Muto (33)" -You must be tired from the long trip.

75
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:49,727
Well, hello.

76
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:53,127
We look forward to staying here, Mr. Muto.

77
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:56,027
Yes, we hope you get to relax here.

78
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:59,327
Well them, I'll be off to sterilize the premises.

79
00:05:59,328 --> 00:06:01,428
I'm counting on you, Mr. Mouri.

80
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:07,527
It's okay, Mr. Mouri.

81
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:10,427
It's already been sterilized inside.

82
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:12,327
Chief Dobashi?

83
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:14,927
You're here too, Mr. Dobashi?

84
00:06:14,928 --> 00:06:17,527
I heard that you were unusually taking time off,

85
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:20,027
so I thought you were out with your family.

86
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:23,328
If I remember correctly, you have a daughter?

87
00:06:24,428 --> 00:06:25,827
Don't worry.

88
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:28,528
I'm getting along fine with my daughter.

89
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:32,027
Well, what a coincidence!

90
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:34,727
I have a daughter too.

91
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,627
Mr. Mouri, today is also your graduation exam day

92
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:39,627
from Dobashi Security Guard Agency, you know.

93
00:06:39,628 --> 00:06:42,627
Oh, yes, indeed.

94
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:44,627
Talk about stressful.

95
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:48,627
How reassuring to have two good men looking out for me.

96
00:06:48,628 --> 00:06:50,527
I feel like a princess.

97
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:53,427
Yeah, but a princess way past her prime I'd say.

98
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:55,827
Reina.

99
00:06:55,828 --> 00:06:59,327
Then, why don't you look after Princess Reina, Mr. Dobashi?

100
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:02,528
I feel safe as long as Mr. Mouri's with me.

101
00:07:05,128 --> 00:07:07,128
Come on, dad.

102
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,027
I'm perfectly fine with sweetie Kusumoto, you see.

103
00:07:12,028 --> 00:07:14,627
Oh no... I'm not a bodyguard.

104
00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:15,928
I'm just joking.

105
00:07:18,828 --> 00:07:23,027
Reina's famous for being a troublemaker, right?

106
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:26,127
Yes, I hear she's always fighting at the location sites.

107
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:28,527
-Moreover... -We're in the same agency,

108
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:31,127
and yet are like cats and dogs.

109
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:33,427
That's famous too.

110
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:36,327
But, I may be the problem rather than her.

111
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:38,727
I don't get along with anyone here,

112
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:41,827
I wonder why nobody likes me.

113
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,927
Is it because I try too hard although it's not a drama?

114
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:48,127
Am I taking too long?

115
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:49,527
No... That's not it...

116
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:52,527
This program wouldn't exist without you, Ryo.

117
00:07:52,528 --> 00:07:54,527
I heard, Kushizaki.

118
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:56,227
Rumor that the program'll be cancelled.

119
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:58,427
And that the ratings are low too.

120
00:07:58,428 --> 00:08:01,828
No... Rumors are nothing more than rumors.

121
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:07,227
I'm sorry if you lose your jobs.

122
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:09,228
It's all because of me.

123
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,827
I mean, she's making the most out of all of us.

124
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:22,427
She's paid more than her skills and time are worth.

125
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:23,428
That's what it is...

126
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:26,428
Cool it. Isokawa, come on.

127
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:28,927
-This voice? -It's Reina.

128
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:30,427
What do you mean it's already sterilized?

129
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:31,928
It can't be!

130
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:39,928
Are you all right?

131
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,528
What? What the...

132
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,328
I've had it!

133
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:54,527
What's the matter, Reina?

134
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:55,928
Maybe it's that?

135
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:02,327
I'm so sorry...

136
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:04,627
There are a lot of stray cats out here.

137
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,128
I'll clean the room up again right away.

138
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:10,627
Hey, you know it, right, Kusumoto?

139
00:09:10,628 --> 00:09:13,827
That I really can't handle this.

140
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:15,427
Allergic to cats.

141
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:16,627
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:16,628 --> 00:09:20,527
I did tell Mr. Mouri about you too, Reina, but...

143
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:22,527
No, it's my mistake.

144
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:26,027
I should've left everything up to Mr. Mouri.

145
00:09:26,028 --> 00:09:27,327
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:27,328 --> 00:09:29,627
What? Is something wrong?

147
00:09:29,628 --> 00:09:30,827
Not really...

148
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:33,327
I'm not a Maru-whatever,

149
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:37,128
so I found out that I can't have maximum protection like you.

150
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:48,728
-Cheers! -Cheers!

151
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:53,027
They're both beautiful. As expected.

152
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:55,327
True.

153
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,427
You can't tell their like cats and dogs.

154
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:00,427
They're actresses all right.

155
00:10:00,428 --> 00:10:01,727
Cut.

156
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:03,127
Okay.

157
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:05,027
Next, we're switching scenes!

158
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:07,527
Aren't we going to retake the previous shot before that?

159
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:10,027
Oh... I'm sorry...

160
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:11,627
Talk about disorganized...

161
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:13,827
I hope you don't keep me up all night for this.

162
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:15,527
Because it's bad for my skin.

163
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:16,627
That's right...

164
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:19,928
Because Ryo's way past her prime.

165
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:24,928
Let's retake the scene!

166
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:28,527
Goodnight!

167
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:31,327
After the breakfast shoot tomorrow,

168
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:33,627
we'll be shooting at the lake.

169
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:35,828
Thank you, everyone!

170
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:55,828
I wonder who it is at this time of night?

171
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,328
That's Ryo's room.

172
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:28,804
That's it!

173
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:36,703
This is...

174
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:38,503
Kusumoto?

175
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:39,904
Hey, hold it!

176
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:43,703
No point running.

177
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,904
I've already called the police.

178
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:48,203
Don't tell me that...

179
00:11:48,204 --> 00:11:50,103
Is it about the transfer?

180
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:52,703
Yeah! I want to stay at the set...

181
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:55,603
But, I'll bet you told the higher ups to move me to desk work.

182
00:11:55,604 --> 00:11:59,203
Is that why you've been following her around trying to killer her?

183
00:11:59,204 --> 00:12:01,904
No! This was the first and only time!

184
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:10,503
I'm just saying you that there are still many others that hate you.

185
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:12,003
No.

186
00:12:12,004 --> 00:12:13,603
What's the matter?

187
00:12:13,604 --> 00:12:14,903
Dad?

188
00:12:14,904 --> 00:12:18,303
Oh? Well...

189
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,504
This is...

190
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:32,803
-The wind is nice. -It feels great.

191
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:36,103
I wonder if it'll be okay to keep shooting?

192
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:39,703
After he said that, there are still a lot of people who don't like Ryo.

193
00:12:39,704 --> 00:12:42,603
That's why Pops and everyone else are keeping close watch over her

194
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:44,204
just in case, right?

195
00:12:46,004 --> 00:12:48,003
Cut!

196
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:49,403
Okay!

197
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:52,903
Next, please get the boats ready!

198
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:55,103
The forecast says there will be fog today.

199
00:12:55,104 --> 00:12:56,803
The oars will be harder to handle,

200
00:12:56,804 --> 00:12:58,203
so please be careful.

201
00:12:58,204 --> 00:13:00,803
Just what do you mean by that?

202
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:05,103
As you can see, the mountains around here have a unique shape

203
00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:06,803
and it seems that the wind

204
00:13:06,804 --> 00:13:10,303
that blows downward subtly affects the waves.

205
00:13:10,304 --> 00:13:12,803
How frightening.

206
00:13:12,804 --> 00:13:15,603
Mr. Dobashi, you have a phone call.

207
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:17,704
It must be the results of the investigation.

208
00:13:18,304 --> 00:13:19,504
Investigation?

209
00:13:30,904 --> 00:13:35,303
Mr. Kushizaki, please send in the two extras.

210
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:36,503
Okay.

211
00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:39,303
Conan, Ran, you're on.

212
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:40,304
Yes, sir.

213
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:41,304
Let's go.

214
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,204
What's that?

215
00:13:53,604 --> 00:13:54,804
What's happening?

216
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,603
What a dense fog.

217
00:13:59,604 --> 00:14:01,803
Is everyone okay?

218
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:04,603
This is Arimura! The oars aren't working.

219
00:14:04,604 --> 00:14:07,003
And we lost sight of Ryo and Reina.

220
00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:08,904
What?

221
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:12,903
Mr. Mouri! Confirm whether the Marutai is safe!

222
00:14:12,904 --> 00:14:15,403
But my oars aren't working either...

223
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:17,003
I can't see her.

224
00:14:17,004 --> 00:14:18,803
Dad! Are you okay?

225
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:21,803
Leave it to me! I give you my word, I'll keep her safe.

226
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:25,303
Hold it, I just received some unbelievable inspection results.

227
00:14:25,304 --> 00:14:26,903
On this case we're handling,

228
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:30,403
she could've made all this up.

229
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:33,103
It seems that an informal decision of laying her off

230
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:35,203
from the agency has been in process.

231
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:37,603
And it seems she caught on to this...

232
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:41,103
So, she conjured up a topic that would interest the mass media.

233
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:42,803
No way.

234
00:14:42,804 --> 00:14:45,703
But the worst of it all, is that it seems she thinks

235
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:49,403
that Reina has caught on to this too.

236
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:51,203
Don't tell me that because of this?

237
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:53,903
Ryo's going to kill Reina?

238
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:55,303
Wait, Conan!

239
00:14:55,304 --> 00:14:56,704
I'll row the boat!

240
00:14:59,404 --> 00:15:02,603
No good. I can't work the oars...

241
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:04,803
Do you see anything, Conan?

242
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:06,704
Nope. Nothing at all...

243
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:10,903
What's this sound?

244
00:15:10,904 --> 00:15:12,104
What was that?

245
00:15:17,004 --> 00:15:18,104
This sound?

246
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:22,703
No good, we're being swept away.

247
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:24,803
I see! I got it.

248
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:26,904
Conan? What's that?

249
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,704
Darn, I'm being swept away by the wind.

250
00:15:42,104 --> 00:15:43,204
That's...

251
00:15:49,504 --> 00:15:50,704
That's...

252
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:57,303
This is Ryo's...

253
00:15:57,304 --> 00:15:58,704
The other is the film crews'...

254
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:06,504
Ryo, where are you?

255
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,404
Reina?

256
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:17,203
She's just passed out.

257
00:16:17,204 --> 00:16:19,304
Don't tell me that Ryo...

258
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:28,403
Everybody got washed up here like us.

259
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,103
Wait over here, Ran, since it's dangerous.

260
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:32,603
No, Conan!

261
00:16:32,604 --> 00:16:34,004
I'm coming with you.

262
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:43,304
Ryo?

263
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:45,503
Stay away, Mr. Mouri!

264
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,103
Don't tell me... Just as I thought...

265
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:48,203
Don't move!

266
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:49,404
What?

267
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,204
Dad?

268
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:19,803
Are you all right, Pops?

269
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:21,403
Hide, both of you!

270
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:22,803
Mr. Mouri...

271
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:24,603
Who the heck was that?

272
00:17:24,604 --> 00:17:26,503
Where's Reina? Where is she?

273
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:30,103
What? Could that have been her?

274
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:33,203
She pretended to be passed out and after I left.

275
00:17:33,204 --> 00:17:34,903
That's not it.

276
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:36,703
No, not possible.

277
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:39,703
That cat-hater could never make it this far.

278
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:40,803
More importantly,

279
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:44,704
how'd you know all the boats would be washed up here?

280
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:49,903
Oh, so that's the story.

281
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:52,803
Ryo, will you trust me?

282
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:56,203
Of course, you're my bodyguard.

283
00:17:56,204 --> 00:17:58,704
Okay, then.

284
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:04,403
Ryo, hide behind that big tree.

285
00:18:04,404 --> 00:18:07,304
No, Pops! You didn't sterilize yet.

286
00:18:15,604 --> 00:18:16,704
What the...

287
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:24,704
Mr. Dobashi?

288
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:28,303
Dad, are you all right?

289
00:18:28,304 --> 00:18:30,203
You did it, Pops!

290
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:33,703
Mr. Dobashi, you checked beforehand, didn't you?

291
00:18:33,704 --> 00:18:35,903
The direction the wind would blow if there is to be a fog,

292
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:37,603
the movement of the waves,

293
00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:40,503
or where we would all land if we were swept away by the wind...

294
00:18:40,504 --> 00:18:42,604
In other words, you sterilized the place.

295
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:46,503
You beat everyone here on a motorboat

296
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:48,703
that you probably got ready beforehand

297
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:53,003
that wouldn't be affected by the wind or the waves.

298
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:56,103
So, the sound we heard was that of a motorboat.

299
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:59,003
You did all this to kill Ryo.

300
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,403
You wanted to make it look like Ryo killed Reina,

301
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:03,203
then killed me as well because I tried to stop her,

302
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:05,804
and then finally she kills herself.

303
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:10,103
And, you were saying something about an investigation, weren't you?

304
00:19:10,104 --> 00:19:12,103
That was indeed something you made up.

305
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:14,303
You asked someone at your company

306
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:17,003
to call you at a pre-set time.

307
00:19:17,004 --> 00:19:19,103
The contents didn't matter.

308
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:22,503
I can easily check on it and confirm!

309
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:24,903
Oh, there you are, everyone.

310
00:19:24,904 --> 00:19:28,904
It's good that we landed but, we got lost in the fog...

311
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:32,003
I heard something that sounded like a gun shot?

312
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,203
Did something happen?

313
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:36,103
What now, Mr. Dobashi?

314
00:19:36,104 --> 00:19:39,904
It's hard to silence as many people as this, you know?

315
00:19:41,904 --> 00:19:44,403
It was last month.

316
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:46,803
That my daughter tried out for an audition for a drama

317
00:19:46,804 --> 00:19:48,603
and was dropped.

318
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,403
She was so depressed,

319
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:53,203
she attempted suicide the following day.

320
00:19:53,204 --> 00:19:57,003
The judge at that time was her.

321
00:19:57,004 --> 00:20:01,803
I wanted to take revenge for my daughter, as her father.

322
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:05,004
Wait, that wasn't me.

323
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:08,403
I wasn't feeling well that day,

324
00:20:08,404 --> 00:20:10,003
so I had someone else take my place.

325
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:11,004
As judge.

326
00:20:11,005 --> 00:20:12,303
Who was it?

327
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:14,603
Me.

328
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:16,103
Enough, already.

329
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:18,503
I was dodging the kitties and fell.

330
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:20,803
I fainted!

331
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:25,003
I mean, I can't stand the itchiness.

332
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:26,803
You're the one who dropped my daughter.

333
00:20:26,804 --> 00:20:29,903
So... If you're going to kill anyone, it should be me.

334
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:33,803
You shouldn't make a mistake, you know?

335
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:38,103
Your daughter misses you and wants to see you.

336
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,203
Reina's been visiting the hospital to see her

337
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:42,903
at least once every two days.

338
00:20:42,904 --> 00:20:44,904
You knew?

339
00:20:47,004 --> 00:20:50,603
It's just like you, so different from me.

340
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:54,204
But, you didn't even know about it, Mr. Dobashi.

341
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:02,003
You get along fine with your daughter?

342
00:21:02,004 --> 00:21:05,303
And this is what you do? Killing people?

343
00:21:05,304 --> 00:21:07,003
You didn't do it for you daughter.

344
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:09,703
You did it only to attain self-satisfaction.

345
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:11,703
Didn't you do this just so that you could prove to yourself

346
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:15,404
that you were being her father?

347
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:22,103
You may be a bodyguard,

348
00:21:22,104 --> 00:21:24,803
but you're a failure as a father.

349
00:21:24,804 --> 00:21:28,303
Well, I can't talk either, but...

350
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:29,604
Dad.

351
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:35,103
Right, the same goes for you, Mr. Mouri.

352
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,603
You're a failure as a bodyguard.

353
00:21:36,604 --> 00:21:38,603
You used me as decoy.

354
00:21:38,604 --> 00:21:41,403
Well... That was...

355
00:21:41,404 --> 00:21:43,103
You're fired as of today.

356
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:46,403
Go back to where you belong!

357
00:21:46,404 --> 00:21:47,804
Yes.

358
00:21:51,204 --> 00:21:53,904
Thank you, Mr. Detective.

"Ryo Haneki Retires!"

361
00:23:20,004 --> 00:23:24,003
Ryo's going to go independent and become president of a company.

362
00:23:24,004 --> 00:23:25,703
It seems Reina, who moved agencies,

363
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,903
is going to be the first actress

364
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:29,303
with an exclusive contract at Ryo's agency.

365
00:23:29,304 --> 00:23:31,603
This is it...

366
00:23:31,604 --> 00:23:34,203
Weren't you fired, Dad?

367
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,403
I'm going to accumulate more results

368
00:23:36,404 --> 00:23:39,403
and become Yoko's exclusive bodyguard.

369
00:23:39,404 --> 00:23:41,504
So that's what you're after.

370
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:44,604
The old man never learns.

This is bad!

373
00:24:02,004 --> 00:24:03,703
Hey, what's going on?

374
00:24:03,704 --> 00:24:05,903
Ayumi's been kidnapped!

375
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,704
I'll go after him!

376
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:15,804
