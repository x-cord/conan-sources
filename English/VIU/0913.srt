1
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:32,895
This is The Metropolitan Police Department!

2
00:00:32,895 --> 00:00:35,095
Iwao Takatori!

3
00:00:35,095 --> 00:00:37,895
You're under arrest for robbing a jewelry store!

4
00:00:37,895 --> 00:00:40,095
"Iwao Takatori (38)" -You're a bunch of uncultured fools.

5
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:42,995
How dare you interrupt my coffee time?

6
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:44,695
Where's your accomplice?

7
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:47,195
Where did you hide the jewels you stole?

8
00:00:49,395 --> 00:00:52,595
I don't know what you're talking about.

9
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:54,095
Don't play dumb.

10
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:58,195
We know you entered a Beika City jewelry store

11
00:00:58,195 --> 00:01:00,995
at 8:00 pm last night

12
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:02,395
and stole 300 million yen worth of jewels.

13
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:10,595
"Tokuro Utsumi (32)" -Your accomplice is...

14
00:01:10,595 --> 00:01:12,895
Tokuro Utsumi, 32 years old.

15
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:16,295
Isn't he the partner you've worked with several times now?

16
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:20,095
Utsumi?

17
00:01:20,095 --> 00:01:23,395
He's not my partner!

18
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:24,495
What?

19
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:25,795
So?

20
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:30,495
Were our faces caught on a security camera or something?

21
00:01:30,495 --> 00:01:32,095
Well, actually...

22
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:36,595
In that case, we're done here.

23
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:37,895
No.

24
00:01:37,895 --> 00:01:40,595
There's still plenty for us to discuss, Takatori.

25
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:46,695
The Sleeping Kogoro.

26
00:01:46,695 --> 00:01:50,795
Waiting until just before a store closes

27
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:52,695
to steal the freshly acquired expensive jewels

28
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,895
with guns as a pair.

29
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:57,995
That's your specialty, Takatori.

30
00:01:57,995 --> 00:01:59,895
One more thing,

31
00:01:59,895 --> 00:02:01,295
even though you always wore masks,

32
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:02,795
there was a incriminating piece of evidence

33
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:04,595
captured by the cameras.

34
00:02:05,695 --> 00:02:08,395
You're sure, Mouri?

35
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:11,595
Of course, Inspector.

36
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:12,595
That is...

37
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:17,395
What?

38
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:18,995
Run!

39
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:27,195
To the rear exit.

40
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:42,795
Don't move!

41
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,995
Takatori, stop right...

42
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:47,095
Conan?

43
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:48,795
Kid?

44
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:51,895
What are you doing here?

45
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:54,795
It's too dangerous. You should go.

46
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:55,795
Stand up.

47
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:00,895
Don't move.

48
00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:03,495
I'll blow the kid's head apart...

49
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:07,595
like a crushed tomato.

50
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:15,795
-Wait! -Takatori!

51
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,595
Conan!

52
00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:18,895
Darn.

53
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:20,995
Find them!

54
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:22,295
Hurry!

55
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:26,195
When the countdown reaches zero,

56
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:28,595
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

57
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:32,795
I'm kidnapped in the middle of solving a mystery!

58
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,795
This is a first!

59
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:36,295
He sees through the one and only truth.

60
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:37,995
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

61
00:03:37,995 --> 00:03:40,495
His name is Detective Conan!

62
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:24,161
"Conan Kidnapped (Part 1)"

63
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:26,561
"Checkpoint"

64
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:33,161
I see.

65
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:34,261
While I was sleeping...

66
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:36,661
Rather, while I was explaining my reasoning,

67
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:38,561
that's what happened.

68
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:40,361
But, Inspector,

69
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:44,061
we should prioritize rescuing the kid

70
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:47,261
over redeeming my name after being interrupted.

71
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:48,861
I know that.

72
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:50,761
In addition to setting up checkpoints,

73
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:53,461
we'll reinvestigate yesterday's case.

74
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:04,561
What's going on?

75
00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:10,461
There's a checkpoint up ahead.

76
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:11,461
What will you do?

77
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:17,461
Looks like you know where you want to go...

78
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:21,261
But you can't just keep going forward.

79
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:29,161
So the jewels that were stolen yesterday

80
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:33,361
had arrived just before the store closed?

81
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:35,461
"Teruaki Shimazu (55)" -Yes. When I looked it up later,

82
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,661
it became clear.

83
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:38,661
They were all expensive jewels

84
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:40,861
worth at least five million yen.

85
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:43,061
This is a major blow to the store.

86
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:44,561
I don't know what to do.

87
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:49,061
I assume your delivery schedule was confidential.

88
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:50,561
Of course.

89
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:54,261
I hadn't even told my employees until just beforehand.

90
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:55,661
Right?

91
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:58,761
"Setsuo Yamaga (43), Jewelry Store Buyer" -Yes. I have no idea

92
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:01,161
who or how it was leaked.

93
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:06,161
But there's your supplier and the delivery company.

94
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:09,061
Weren't there some things you had no control over?

95
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:12,961
I suppose you're right.

96
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:16,261
Inspector, have you heard from Takagi and Chiba?

97
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:17,661
Not yet.

98
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:19,661
The checkpoints haven't reported

99
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:23,261
finding the car we're looking for either.

100
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:26,861
Then we'll have to follow this thread for now.

101
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:32,661
We've got to find a clue to the kid and Takatori's whereabouts.

102
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:36,061
I'll have them investigate the jewelry supplier

103
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:38,461
and delivery company immediately.

104
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:39,761
Please do!

105
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:46,961
What?

106
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:47,961
Now that I get a better look,

107
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:50,061
this car doesn't have a navigator system.

108
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:53,161
Since we're on Kitahinode Road,

109
00:07:53,161 --> 00:07:56,161
if you take the side road we passed earlier,

110
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:59,361
you'll end up on Nakahotoke Road.

111
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:05,061
I like going for drives,

112
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:07,661
so I remembered all the streets.

113
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:09,961
We can go shopping.

114
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:11,261
What?

115
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:12,661
The rope ladder.

116
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:15,061
I don't know what it's for,

117
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,661
but you dropped it while you were running.

118
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:21,861
I thought there might be a home improvement store along a city road.

119
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:25,861
You're an interesting kid.

120
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:40,661
"Shingetsu Bar"

121
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:47,761
"Kitahinode Shopping Center"

122
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:53,761
"Kitahinode Shopping Center"

123
00:08:57,461 --> 00:08:59,861
Anyone. Is anyone here?

124
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:03,561
How about a public phone?

125
00:09:10,661 --> 00:09:14,461
Are all the stores here closed down?

126
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,061
Oh, no!

127
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:28,261
He's coming.

128
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:29,261
He's going to run me over.

129
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:44,461
"Do Not Enter"

130
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:02,461
"Shingetsu Bar"

131
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:04,561
Let's go.

132
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:05,561
What?

133
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:15,861
I didn't get a good look at those matches,

134
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:17,661
and I've already forgotten what was on them.

135
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:21,761
I promise I won't tell anyone about you.

136
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:24,561
Actually, if you take me with you,

137
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:26,861
you'll probably draw even more attention to yourself.

138
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:28,561
No matter how you look at it,

139
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:32,361
you're clearly not my dad or brother.

140
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:38,961
But maybe we should switch cars.

141
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:43,061
We could even get license plates from another car.

142
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:45,361
I'm sure it'd be easy for you.

143
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:53,561
If only we could listen to the police radio.

144
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:55,161
We'd know how much they've figured out

145
00:10:55,161 --> 00:10:57,561
and what they're looking for,

146
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:59,861
even the locations of the checkpoints.

147
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:04,688
What?

148
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:20,368
I didn't get a good look at those matches,

149
00:11:20,368 --> 00:11:22,168
and I've already forgotten what was on them.

150
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:26,268
I promise I won't tell anyone about you.

151
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,068
Actually, if you take me with you,

152
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:31,268
you'll probably draw even more attention.

153
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:33,068
No matter how you look at it,

154
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:36,868
you're clearly not my dad or brother.

155
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:43,468
But maybe we should switch cars.

156
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:47,468
We could even get license plates from another car.

157
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:49,868
I'm sure it'd be easy for you.

158
00:11:53,868 --> 00:11:58,068
If only we could listen to the police radio.

159
00:11:58,068 --> 00:11:59,568
We'd know how much they've figured out

160
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,968
and what they're looking for,

161
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:04,968
even the locations of the checkpoints.

162
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:05,968
What?

163
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:15,668
I won't say it again. Shut up.

164
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:18,168
Okay.

165
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:21,568
I wouldn't mind tying you up

166
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:25,968
and keeping you in the trunk until we get there.

167
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:27,068
There?

168
00:12:29,368 --> 00:12:34,068
Where are we going when he knows I'd slow him down?

169
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:36,868
"Lulu Port, Underground Parking Entrance"

170

"Underground Parking Entrance"

00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:03,968
He doesn't have all the jewels he stole right now.

172
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:05,668
Which means...

173
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,568
he's most likely going to find the rest of the jewels

174
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:10,468
and his accomplice.

175
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:11,668
But...

176
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:13,568
Utsumi?

177
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:17,068
He's not my partner!

178
00:13:17,068 --> 00:13:19,168
What happened?

179
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:30,568
What is that?

180
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:38,468
Listen up. Try to run, and I'll shoot.

181
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:41,168
If you don't want to die here

182
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:44,568
and get torn apart by stray dogs,

183
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:46,468
do as I say.

184
00:13:46,468 --> 00:13:51,268
I just need to get a new rope ladder.

185
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:53,468
Okay, got it.

186
00:13:57,168 --> 00:13:58,168
That way.

187
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:03,568
Stop there.

188
00:14:04,868 --> 00:14:08,068
Is this the entrance to that chimney?

189
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:09,968
That's right.

190
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:11,468
I see.

191
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:14,268
So that's why you needed a rope ladder.

192
00:14:14,268 --> 00:14:16,968
I was going to use it to climb down into the chimney,

193
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:19,068
but now I don't need to.

194
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:21,268
I've got you.

195
00:14:21,268 --> 00:14:25,668
You want me to go in here?

196
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:28,768
Inspector Megure.

197
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,368
We found Takatori's car.

198
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:32,668
Where?

199
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:34,968
"Shopping Mall" -It was abandoned in the underground parking lot

200
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:39,268
of a shopping mall on Nakahotoke Road.

201
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:41,468
What about the kid?

202
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:48,168
So far nobody's reported seeing Conan or Takatori.

203
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:49,768
So they walked out of there?

204
00:14:49,768 --> 00:14:54,068
Or did they change cars?

205
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:55,268
That must be it.

206
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:58,768
The question is, where did they go?

207
00:14:58,768 --> 00:15:03,868
It's got to be wherever the jewels and his accomplice is.

208
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:08,168
We'll have to broaden the area of our search.

209
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:09,568
Takagi, Chiba.

210
00:15:09,568 --> 00:15:10,668
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

211
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:18,568
This is Megure.

212
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:21,468
What?

213
00:15:21,468 --> 00:15:23,368
What does that mean?

214
00:15:26,368 --> 00:15:27,968
Got it.

215
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,468
Thank you.

216
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:32,568
What is it, Inspector?

217
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:34,568
That was the local police.

218
00:15:34,568 --> 00:15:37,168
They can't find Yamaga,

219
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:41,368
the buyer for the jewelry store that was robbed.

220
00:15:41,368 --> 00:15:43,168
"Setsuo Yamaga (43), Buyer" -What?

221
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:44,268
Then...

222
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:45,368
Yeah.

223
00:15:45,368 --> 00:15:48,268
It happened as soon as we started checking their supplier

224
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:49,968
and delivery company.

225
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:51,468
Inspector.

226
00:15:51,468 --> 00:15:52,868
Let's head back to the crime scene.

227
00:15:57,068 --> 00:15:58,368
Darn.

228
00:15:58,368 --> 00:15:59,968
It must've happened then.

229
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:11,068
Now this is truly unexpected.

230
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:12,868
Are you listening, kid?

231
00:16:14,868 --> 00:16:17,168
Come back in exactly three minutes.

232
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:19,468
If you're even a second late,

233
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:22,668
I'll throw this down there.

234
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:24,068
You must be joking.

235
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:28,068
If you do that, I'll get caught in the smoke and suffocate.

236
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:29,868
Got it, kid?

237
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:32,668
Got it.

238
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:35,068
Darn.

239
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:36,568
This isn't my lucky day.

240
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:40,168
What exactly is going on?

241
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,468
We're about to investigate that.

242
00:16:45,768 --> 00:16:46,768
Excuse me.

243
00:16:52,168 --> 00:16:53,368
What are these?

244
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:55,168
I thought so.

245
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:57,968
Was it Yamaga?

246
00:16:57,968 --> 00:17:01,968
Yes. It's probably what the thieves paid him

247
00:17:01,968 --> 00:17:03,668
for leaking the information.

248
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:04,968
What?

249
00:17:04,968 --> 00:17:08,568
If we looked into the supplier and delivery company,

250
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:11,768
we eventually would've discovered that he was the one person

251
00:17:11,768 --> 00:17:14,768
with all the information,

252
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:17,368
so he made a hasty escape.

253
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:18,768
That must be it.

254
00:17:18,768 --> 00:17:21,568
I don't believe it.

255
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:23,268
Find him immediately.

256
00:17:28,768 --> 00:17:30,168
A dead end?

257
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:34,868
It's the bottom of the chimney.

258
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:41,668
What?

259
00:17:45,268 --> 00:17:47,468
This man...

260
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:48,868
He's...

261
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,868
"Tokuro Utsumi (32)"

262
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:54,368
The jewelry robber's accomplice Utsumi.

263
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,668
The cause of death is...

264
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:00,868
a whole body contusion?

265
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:09,868
Hey, what's he doing here?

266
00:18:09,868 --> 00:18:12,168
Did you kill him?

267
00:18:12,168 --> 00:18:13,868
Just the opposite.

268
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:15,868
He nearly killed me.

269
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:21,668
All right!

270
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,868
What a massive success.

271
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:26,868
Let's celebrate.

272
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:28,368
Not yet.

273
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:29,668
What?

274
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:32,368
We'll hand the goods over to him in exchange for money,

275
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:33,968
just like we planned.

276
00:18:33,968 --> 00:18:36,268
We'll celebrate after,

277
00:18:36,268 --> 00:18:38,668
two hours from now at that location.

278
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:40,768
Got it. You can count on me.

279
00:18:41,768 --> 00:18:43,868
See you later.

280
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,768
He's still not here.

281
00:19:43,368 --> 00:19:45,068
Utsumi!

282
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:56,868
It's been three minutes.

283
00:19:56,868 --> 00:19:58,868
Come back.

284
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:01,668
I'll smoke you out.

285
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,068
Don't.

286
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,968
I'll be right back.

287
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:06,168
Darn.

288
00:20:06,168 --> 00:20:09,568
It's covered in soot, so there aren't any clues.

289
00:20:09,568 --> 00:20:12,868
I won't be able to climb up there.

290
00:20:12,868 --> 00:20:15,868
I have to head back.

291
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:21,668
Is this all?

292
00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:23,768
Hiding them won't do you any good.

293
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:25,468
I'm not hiding anything.

294
00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:27,868
I thought it was strange, too.

295
00:20:27,868 --> 00:20:32,368
Didn't you steal 300 million yen worth of jewels?

296
00:20:32,368 --> 00:20:35,768
This clearly isn't enough.

297
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:38,468
It was him.

298
00:20:38,468 --> 00:20:41,868
He talked him into it.

299
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:44,368
For less than half a share,

300
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,968
he agreed to kill me.

301
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:50,068
Idiot!

302
00:20:50,068 --> 00:20:53,168
Who's "he"?

303
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:56,868
Mister, maybe you were betrayed.

304
00:20:56,868 --> 00:20:59,168
What are you going to do now?

305
00:20:59,168 --> 00:21:01,568
Are you going to...

306
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:14,868
Your job's over.

307
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:18,668
Keep your curiosity in check.

308
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:21,868
If you think I won't kill a kid,

309
00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:23,468
you're dead wrong.

310
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:37,968
Where?

311
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:39,868
Where are we going?

312
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:49,868
He's slowing down?

313
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:51,468
What's happening?

314
00:21:51,468 --> 00:21:53,568
What's he going to do?

315
00:21:53,568 --> 00:21:56,768
Want to get out again, kid?

316
00:21:56,768 --> 00:21:59,868
If you're lucky, you might be saved.

317
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:05,068
What?

318
00:22:11,368 --> 00:22:12,668
Farewell.

319
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:43,768
"Next Episode" -There's no mistaking it.

320
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:45,468
The body inside the chimney belongs to

321
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:47,768
Takatori's accomplice, Utsumi.

322
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:48,868
Please.

323
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:51,468
Please help me look for him.

324
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:53,868
Got it.

325
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:57,368
You've forgotten my share.

326
00:23:57,368 --> 00:24:01,668
And the fee you owe Utsumi for hiring him to kill me!

327
00:24:01,668 --> 00:24:04,068
Too scared to talk?

328
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:07,368
Next Conan,

329
00:24:07,368 --> 00:24:11,068
"Conan Kidnapped (Part 2)"
