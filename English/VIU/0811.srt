1
00:00:00,352 --> 00:00:01,451
We came on a sightseeing tour

2
00:00:01,452 --> 00:00:05,251
to the old Battle of Kawanakajima at Nagano Prefecture.

3
00:00:05,252 --> 00:00:06,751
We coincidentally ran into Inspector Kansuke Yamato

4
00:00:06,752 --> 00:00:07,851
and other Nagano Prefectural Police officers

5
00:00:07,852 --> 00:00:09,051
and they had taken us around.

6
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:11,751
Just as we were about to arrive at the Chikuma River,

7
00:00:11,752 --> 00:00:14,652
we found the head of a person come drifting along the river.

8
00:00:15,852 --> 00:00:19,651
The head that had the mark of a woodpecker footprint on its forehead

9
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:23,351
belonged to Squad Chief Takeda of the Nagano Prefectural Police.

10
00:00:23,352 --> 00:00:26,051
Furthermore, another officer of the Takeda Squad,

11
00:00:26,052 --> 00:00:30,452
Police Lieutenant Kano was also found hung to death at his residence.

12
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:38,451
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

13
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:40,451
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

14
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:42,351
What happened within the organization?

15
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:44,251
Police officers are targeted one after the other.

16
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,851
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:45,852 --> 00:00:47,751
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:47,752 --> 00:00:49,952
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:36,593
"The Darkness of the Prefectural Police (Part 2)"

20
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:49,693
"I shall destroy the woodpeckers"?

21
00:02:50,893 --> 00:02:53,692
"I'm the God of War"?

22
00:02:53,693 --> 00:02:55,592
What're you talking about, Kansuke?

23
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,392
I'm not the one saying it.

24
00:02:57,393 --> 00:03:01,093
On this mail from Mr. Kano, that's what's written.

25
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:07,393
"Hyoe Kuroda (50)"

26
00:03:08,993 --> 00:03:11,892
Cause of death is suffocation from strangulation.

27
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:14,692
Based on postmortem lividity and rigor mortis,

28
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:18,592
estimated time of death is from an hour to an hour and a half ago.

29
00:03:18,593 --> 00:03:21,992
Judging from the Yoshikawa line on the neck that appear when he struggles,

30
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:27,692
Mr. Kano was most probably strangled from behind by someone,

31
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:29,092
then a rope was wound around his neck,

32
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:31,292
which after, he was hung from the ceiling.

33
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:33,692
"Mamoru Saegusa (37)" -There must be more than one perpetrator, then.

34
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:35,292
Because it took all three of us

35
00:03:35,293 --> 00:03:37,492
"Shinsuke Akiyama (26)" -to bring Mr. Kano down too

36
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:39,492
I guess so.

37
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:42,092
No, if a chair were to be placed on the desk

38
00:03:42,093 --> 00:03:43,392
and he was made to sit down,

39
00:03:43,393 --> 00:03:45,892
one person could've hung him.

40
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,592
Even if he were to be someone with bad legs.

41
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:50,293
True.

42
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:54,192
Ringtone of a cell phone?

43
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,193
This is Mr. Kano's!

44
00:04:00,693 --> 00:04:04,692
It's a mail from Mr. Takeda has come to Mr. Kano's cell phone.

45
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:08,492
What? You mean it's from the suspect who killed Squad Chief Takeda.

46
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:09,692
Most likely.

47
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:12,092
And, what does it say?

48
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:15,393
"There are three woodpeckers left".

49
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:19,492
I see.

50
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:23,492
Based on the woodpecker's footprint that was found on Kano's forehead,

51
00:04:23,493 --> 00:04:29,792
the remaining three targets are most likely to be one of the officers.

52
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:30,892
This is just great.

53
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:33,092
Let's give the perpetrator a taste of what happens

54
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:34,692
when you make an enemy of the police!

55
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:35,892
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

56
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:38,092
Inspector Yamato.

57
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:41,492
What do you think of this rope that was wrapped around his neck?

58
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:44,792
Come to think of it.

59
00:04:44,793 --> 00:04:46,492
It's that it's a bit strange.

60
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:49,092
Hey, Kansuke, put on your gloves!

61
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:51,392
I mean I already touched it when I got him down,

62
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:52,892
so it doesn't matter does it?

63
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,792
By the way, Kansuke,

64
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:57,692
it seems that an eye-witness saw you this morning near the bridge

65
00:04:57,693 --> 00:05:00,592
where Mr. Takeda's body was found.

66
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:04,592
Like I already said, I didn't go to that bridge!

67
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:08,392
I'm sure that the witness took me for someone else!

68
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:11,692
I don't see how anyone can mistake you for anybody else but you though.

69
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:14,392
That goes for you too,

70
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:17,493
First Section Chief Kuroda.

71
00:05:18,593 --> 00:05:21,092
What? He was killed?

72
00:05:21,093 --> 00:05:23,992
You mean that Lieutenant called Kano who we met this afternoon?

73
00:05:23,993 --> 00:05:27,092
Yes. He was found hanging from the ceiling of his residence.

74
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,592
So, we were looking for someone who could've had a grudge

75
00:05:29,593 --> 00:05:32,292
against Squad Chief Takeda and Police Lieutenant Kano,

76
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:35,392
but it led us to the random shooting incident nine years ago,

77
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:38,892
and the case of the man who confined himself inside a bank six months ago.

78
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:40,692
Mr. Kano belonged to the Takeda Squad

79
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:42,792
both nine years ago and six months ago.

80
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:46,992
But, the bereaved family of the perpetrator that was shot

81
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:48,392
has all passed away,

82
00:05:48,393 --> 00:05:52,092
and the only person left is the grandmother of the perpetrator, right?

83
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:56,092
Yeah. But that old lady would never be able to cut somebody's head off

84
00:05:56,093 --> 00:06:00,392
nor do a feat such as strangle somebody then hang him from the ceiling.

85
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,792
Which means there's still no prime suspect after all.

86
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:05,992
No, there's just one.

87
00:06:05,993 --> 00:06:06,993
What?

88
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:08,892
The best friend of the perpetrator who watched his friend being killed

89
00:06:08,893 --> 00:06:10,092
right before his eyes.

90
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:11,292
You mean...

91
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:14,593
The one who also objected to the shooting six months ago.

92
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:19,392
Komei. Don't tell me that you...

93
00:06:19,393 --> 00:06:21,292
Right, Kansuke.

94
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:22,792
It's you.

95
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:25,392
You're suspecting me?

96
00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:29,892
Like they say, even parasites inside a lion will eat their host.

97
00:06:29,893 --> 00:06:32,392
Why you...

98
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:36,192
Inspector Yamato could never be the perpetrator!

99
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:39,592
You already know that, right, Inspector Morofushi?

100
00:06:39,593 --> 00:06:42,892
Because you've been best friends since your childhood days.

101
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:44,492
Best friends?

102
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:46,492
Well, that's a first.

103
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:49,893
Yeah. The feeling's mutual.

104
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:57,892
I'm going to continue the investigation on my own from here!

105
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:00,092
Go tell Chief Kuroda that!

106
00:07:00,093 --> 00:07:01,392
Suit yourself.

107
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:02,592
Kansuke?

108
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:06,292
What? Did I say something I wasn't supposed to?

109
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,492
Come to think of it,

110
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:11,492
your trainer was Yamato when you first became a cop, right?

111
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:14,592
But you'd better not side with him just because of that.

112
00:07:14,593 --> 00:07:16,092
Because although your chief was murdered,

113
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:18,392
you still belong to the Takeda Squad, you know?

114
00:07:18,393 --> 00:07:19,792
Yes, sir.

115
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:21,092
Hey.

116
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:24,192
That Lieutenant called Kano went back home

117
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,592
because he realized something, right?

118
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:28,192
Oh, yeah.

119
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:30,792
Do you remember what made him realize it?

120
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:31,793
I wonder.

121
00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:34,892
Well, he had his finger on his forehead for a while,

122
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:37,192
and it looked like he suddenly hit upon an idea.

123
00:07:37,193 --> 00:07:38,592
His forehead?

124
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:40,692
I think he hit upon something

125
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:41,792
after remembering the footprint of the woodpecker

126
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:44,092
that was on Squad Chief Takeda's forehead.

127
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:45,392
What about after that?

128
00:07:45,393 --> 00:07:47,792
We split up and continued to go around asking questions.

129
00:07:47,793 --> 00:07:50,892
We'll let Section Chief Kuroda know about it too.

130
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:53,892
Oh, and I also e-mailed Inspector Yamato

131
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:56,292
although I guess he didn't read it because he was more concerned

132
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:58,292
about the calls from Mr. Kano that he missed.

133
00:07:58,293 --> 00:08:01,892
I mean, why do we have to tell this kid about it?

134
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:06,892
Which means that Kansuke also knew that Mr. Kano returned to his residence.

135
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:10,192
Hey! Are you seriously suspecting Kansuke?

136
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:11,792
Any problem?

137
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:13,592
It's a great problem!

138
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:18,192
Right! Inspector Yamato would never commit murder.

139
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:20,192
Oh, Mr. Aburgawa, telephone?

140
00:08:20,193 --> 00:08:23,792
It's Akiyama. It's about time you remember my name.

141
00:08:23,793 --> 00:08:26,393
Besides, what came is not a phone call but mail.

142
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:29,592
What's the matter, Mr. Akiyama?

143
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:33,092
Nothing. I'm going to go change clothes!

144
00:08:33,093 --> 00:08:35,992
After all, I got quite wet asking around in the rain.

145
00:08:35,993 --> 00:08:37,392
My house is close by too, you see.

146
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:38,892
Hey, come back quickly, okay?

147
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,192
Copy that!

148
00:08:40,193 --> 00:08:43,692
Come to think of it, his mother's house is right near here.

149
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:46,992
Yes, I think it was the beauty salon at the corner.

150
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,992
I'm Bishamonten...

151
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:52,093
I'm...

152
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:57,193
I'm Bishamonten.

153
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:00,392
I shall destroy the woodpecker.

154
00:09:00,393 --> 00:09:02,993
I'm the God of War!

155
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:13,392
It matched?

156
00:09:13,393 --> 00:09:14,992
You mean the body that was found under the bridge

157
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:16,892
and Chief Takeda's head?

158
00:09:16,893 --> 00:09:22,592
Yeah, the DNA of the right toe, which barely made it unburned, matched.

159
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:24,992
What about the other guys?

160
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:27,092
A lot of things happened

161
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:28,392
so Inspector Yamato went off to investigate on his own.

162
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:31,992
Morofushi, I told you to keep your eyes on him, didn't I?

163
00:09:31,993 --> 00:09:33,392
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:36,192
We don't seem to have good chemistry.

165
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:38,292
Where're Akiyama and Saegusa?

166
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:41,192
Mr. Akiyama went to his mother's house to get changed

167
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:43,592
because he got wet

168
00:09:43,593 --> 00:09:45,792
but he didn't come back even after we waited for a while.

169
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,893
So, Mr. Saegusa went to check on him now.

170
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:52,992
Morofushi? This is Saegusa.

171
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,792
Is something wrong?

172
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:56,592
I tell you that guy!

173
00:09:56,593 --> 00:09:58,692
After he went to his mother's place and got changed,

174
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:02,192
I hear he took his car and drove off to Mount Saijo!

175
00:10:02,193 --> 00:10:03,193
Mount Saijo?

176
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:08,292
Yeah. To the mountain shack where the wanted robber is hiding out!

177
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:09,492
I'm headed over there now,

178
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:10,793
so will you guys please come too!

179
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:13,992
Gosh.

180
00:10:13,993 --> 00:10:15,893
How come you're in here?

181
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:19,192
No problem is there?

182
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:20,292
By the way...

183
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:23,692
Why do you have a spare tire in the backseat?

184
00:10:23,693 --> 00:10:26,492
For some reason, I'm experiencing a lot of flats recently.

185
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,292
I have them here so I can change tires easily.

186
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:29,592
Are they in your way?

187
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:31,092
Nope, I'm fine.

188
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:33,393
What? That tire, a while ago...

189
00:10:35,793 --> 00:10:38,192
I'm Bishamonten.

190
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:41,092
I shall destroy the woodpeckers.

191
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:42,793
I'm the God of War!

192
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:49,692
He doesn't seem to be at the mountain shack.

193
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:52,793
We've got no choice but look around here.

194
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:01,593
There he is!

195
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,992
Help me.

196
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:05,392
He's being dragged along by the car!

197
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:08,093
My cell phone...

198
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:14,793
Akiyama!

199
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:21,893
Akiyama!

200
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:34,021
Akiyama!

201
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,820
Who would've done a thing like this?

202
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:42,920
Before Akiyama was dragged by the car and fell off the cliff he said...

203
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:44,520
My cell phone...

204
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:45,920
If I recall correctly.

205
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:48,920
Hey, ring Akiyama's cell phone.

206
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:50,021
Yes, sir.

207
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:56,220
I found it!

208
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:59,221
It's unmistakably Akiyama's cell phone.

209
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:08,720
He received a mail at sundown, 5:32 pm.

210
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:11,320
Oh, I remember that.

211
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:15,120
After looking at the mail, Mr. Akiyama said he was going to change clothes

212
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:16,920
and went to his parents' beauty salon.

213
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:21,720
Then, without returning to NPD headquarters he came here to Mount Saijo.

214
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:24,120
And, what does the mail say?

215
00:12:24,121 --> 00:12:26,320
"I found the cell phone of Pops Takeda, who was murdered,

216
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:29,620
from inside the belongings of a certain person,

217
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:32,420
and I'm text mailing you from it."

218
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:34,720
"That person is from the police force

219
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:35,920
so I'd like you to make up a good reason

220
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,520
and come to the mountain shack on Mt. Saijo."

221
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:41,820
"I'll tell you the details there."

222
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:44,220
"Kansuke Yamato" -"Kansuke Yamato".

223
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,120
Kansuke's the one who sent the mail?

224
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:50,020
Then, is he the one who lured Akiyama out here

225
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:51,920
and killed him?

226
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:54,320
Can't you get in touch with Yamato?

227
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:58,120
No. I called him repeatedly on our way here,

228
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:00,020
but it seems that he has his phone switched off.

229
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:01,820
Let's put out a criminal search.

230
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:04,820
Yamato's undoubtedly a suspect!

231
00:13:04,821 --> 00:13:07,520
Not necessarily.

232
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:12,820
Because that mail wasn't sent from Inspector Yamato's cell phone.

233
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:15,020
It could be mail that the perpetrator sent

234
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:17,820
pretending to be Inspector Yamato, right?

235
00:13:17,821 --> 00:13:20,620
Besides, if Inspector Yamato were the perpetrator,

236
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:23,420
I don't think he'd leave a cell phone that has a mail like that in it

237
00:13:23,421 --> 00:13:26,820
that could serve as evidence lying around without even looking for it.

238
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:29,820
Just what're you talking about?

239
00:13:29,821 --> 00:13:34,020
I'm sorry, we weren't aware that he was in our car,

240
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,320
but the fact is he...

241
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:37,120
You find the clue to solving the case

242
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:41,420
from an unexpected perspective and support the deduction.

243
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,221
The wisdom bag of the Sleeping Kogoro.

244
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:52,220
It's rumored to be so at MPD, Conan Edogawa.

245
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:55,220
Is that so?

246
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:56,520
However,

247
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:58,420
it could be that we arrived

248
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,820
just as he was about to search for the cell phone

249
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:02,620
so he had no choice but to leave.

250
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:06,120
Or, it could be that Akiyama did some quick thinking.

251
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:08,821
See? I knew it.

252
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:13,920
Yamato's cell phone number is blocked.

253
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:16,820
Akiyama who figured that Yamato might kill him,

254
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:19,120
probably did so in the spur of the moment

255
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:21,220
to prevent the evidence from being erased.

256
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:22,820
No way.

257
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,120
Or the perpetrator, in order to make everyone believe so,

258
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:27,820
set it up beforehand to make it look that way.

259
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:31,120
Yeah? I would've thought so too.

260
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,220
Until I was informed by forensics a while ago.

261
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:35,520
Informed?

262
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:39,420
Yamato's fingerprints were detected on the rope that Kano was hung with.

263
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:42,421
I'm calling a search out for him as a murder suspect!

264
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:46,220
Please wait, sir!

265
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:48,520
Inspector Yamato touched that rope

266
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,420
when he brought Lieutenant Kano down.

267
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:52,920
He's prints were not only found on the top part of the roof

268
00:14:52,921 --> 00:14:55,020
that was hooked onto the lighting of the room.

269
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:58,020
They were also found on the rope that was wrapped around the neck.

270
00:14:58,021 --> 00:15:01,520
That's proof that he strangled Kano with that rope!

271
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:02,521
No.

272
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:06,720
Morofushi. Did Yamato touch the rope by the neck back then?

273
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:07,920
No.

274
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:11,520
I was near the corpse until forensics got there

275
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:14,520
but nobody touched the rope by his neck.

276
00:15:14,521 --> 00:15:17,120
Considering the testimony of a witness,

277
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:20,820
who claim to have seen Yamato under the bridge

278
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:23,520
where Takeda's corpse was found,

279
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:26,520
including the random shooting incident that occurred nine years ago

280
00:15:26,521 --> 00:15:30,420
and the barricade incident at the bank six months ago.

281
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:33,120
I think that a BOLO search is appropriate.

282
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:37,020
But Inspector Yamato would never commit murder!

283
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:40,220
We should prioritize justice over emotions right now.

284
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:43,420
If we let him get away, we may regret it.

285
00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:45,520
Okay. We'll set up checkpoints immediately

286
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:48,120
and get custody of Yamato at all costs.

287
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:51,020
Don't go easy on him just because you know him.

288
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:56,920
Remember that he's a serial killer that killed three officers in a row!

289
00:15:56,921 --> 00:16:00,120
I'm going back to headquarters to carry out an investigation meeting.

290
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:03,520
Oh, but what about Akiyama's body?

291
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:07,420
The ground's muddy from the rain and it's already this dark.

292
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:10,620
We can retrieve his body after daybreak, right?

293
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:13,320
Saegusa, you get in my car!

294
00:16:13,321 --> 00:16:15,620
I think it'll be too cluttered in Morufushi's car

295
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:19,420
with the spare tire in the backseat and all.

296
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:22,321
"Mount Saijo Observation Platform"

297
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:25,021
Hey.

298
00:16:25,022 --> 00:16:27,720
Is it true that Inspector Yamato brought down

299
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:30,320
the body of Lieutenant Kano?

300
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:31,520
Yes.

301
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:33,120
Kansuke got on a chair.

302
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:36,120
Then Mr. Akiyama and the others held the corpse up a bit.

303
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,120
But, Inspector Yamato has a bad leg, doesn't he?

304
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:43,220
Kansuke's tall and besides, if the thinks the person can still be saved,

305
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:45,320
he'll do what he can without thinking.

306
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:47,820
Come to think of it, it was the same the other day too.

307
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:49,320
The other day?

308
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:51,820
You mean something similar happened before too?

309
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:53,120
Yeah.

310
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:55,920
The parents of the suspect of the bank confined case

311
00:16:55,921 --> 00:16:57,520
that came up a while ago,

312
00:16:57,521 --> 00:17:00,020
couldn't put up with the treatment they were getting from the neighbors

313
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:02,120
so they hung themselves.

314
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,220
Even back then as soon as he got to the scene,

315
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:06,920
Kansuke got onto a chair and took them down.

316
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:09,220
But, unlike Mr. Kano's time,

317
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:13,320
he just untied the knot of the rope that was tied to the beams back then.

318
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:16,720
Then, how was the rope that Lieutenant Kano was hung by?

319
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:23,220
Well, he was hanging from a rope made from two connected loops.

320
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:26,720
The upper loop was tied around the light bar.

321
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:30,320
Kansuke grabbed the upper loop with both hands

322
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:33,220
and removed it from the lamp.

323
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:38,420
Did that rope by any chance look like this?

324
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:39,920
Yeah.

325
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:42,620
Then when he lay the corpse on the floor,

326
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:44,320
do you remember who was where?

327
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:47,220
If I remember correctly,

328
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:49,520
Inspector Morofushi and Mr. Akiyama were bent down near the corpse,

329
00:17:49,521 --> 00:17:52,420
but the others were standing some distance away.

330
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:55,120
Then, didn't something happen back then?

331
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:57,520
Like something that would distract everyone's attention?

332
00:17:57,521 --> 00:17:58,521
Now that you mentioned it,

333
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:02,420
a message from Takeda's phone thought to be sent by the suspect

334
00:18:02,421 --> 00:18:04,520
was sent to Kano's phone,

335
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:07,520
which was in the body's coat pocket.

336
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:10,220
It said, "There are three woodpeckers left"

337
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:13,920
When you overlay the mail that was sent to Kasuke's cell phone that said,

338
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:18,420
"I shall destroy the woodpeckers. I'm the God of War!"...

339
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:21,520
If we exclude Mr. Akiyama, who was killed after that,

340
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:24,920
it means that the killer is going to kill two more people, right?

341
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:27,920
But, who? And for what?

342
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:29,720
What is this woodpecker bit about?

343
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:32,320
I can't say for sure just yet

344
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,320
but I more or less know whose life

345
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,020
the perpetrator is most likely after next.

346
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:37,420
What?

347
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:38,920
It's the names.

348
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:40,420
I don't know why

349
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:43,320
but the three who've been killed up to now all have names similar

350
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:48,920
to the generals that have been killed at the fourth Battle of Kawanakajima.

351
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:51,420
Chief Takeda, who was the first one murdered,

352
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,620
corresponds to Nobushige Takeda.

353
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:55,320
Police Lieutenant Shoji Kano, who was killed next,

354
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:57,120
corresponds to Tadatsugu Hajikano,

355
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:59,920
and Police Sergeant Shinosuke Akiyama, who was killed just a while ago,

356
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:01,020
used to go by the name Aburakawa,

357
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:02,620
so it corresponds to Nobuyoshi Aburakawa.

358
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:04,920
And, who are the other two?

359
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:08,920
Inspector Mamoru Saegusa who is only one letter off from Morinao Saegusa

360
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:11,520
and the one who felt responsible for the strategy that failed

361
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:13,120
and threw himself into the hands of the enemy,

362
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:15,420
the General of Takeda Army,

363
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,420
Kansuke Yamamoto!

364
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:18,620
What?

365
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:22,120
Just what kind of grudge does anybody have against Kansuke anyway?

366
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:23,121
It may have something to do

367
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:26,820
with the confined bank case that occurred six months ago.

368
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:29,720
Will you tell me the details of it?

369
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:33,320
You mean the case where Chief Takeda shot the suspect.

370
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:36,420
The fact was that suspect was on the verge of turning himself in

371
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:38,820
after being persuaded by the police

372
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:41,720
but the Takeda Squad that had the place surrounded made a forced move,

373
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:44,220
and the suspect who saw this went berserk,

374
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:47,320
firing the gun that he had randomly inside the bank.

375
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:50,020
Mr. Takeda who had no choice but to charge into the bank,

376
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:52,320
and shot the suspect. Fortunately, there were no other casualties.

377
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:56,120
But, Kansuke was outraged at Mr. Takeda.

378
00:19:56,121 --> 00:19:57,620
Don't tell me that you think it's okay

379
00:19:57,621 --> 00:20:00,820
to kill suspects just because you're a cop!

380
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:01,821
So he said.

381
00:20:01,822 --> 00:20:03,120
Come to think of it,

382
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:07,220
the cell phone of the suspect seems to have gone missing in this case.

383
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:08,920
Although he seems to have been talking to someone on it

384
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:11,220
up to the time he was shot.

385
00:20:11,221 --> 00:20:14,120
He said things like, "If they arrest me, you're finished too."

386
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:18,320
"They'll find out where the gun came from as well as about the X".

387
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:19,321
The X too?

388
00:20:19,322 --> 00:20:20,520
Find out?

389
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:22,520
Is that true?

390
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:26,720
Yes, Akiyama was wondering and mentioned something like that the other day,

391
00:20:26,721 --> 00:20:27,920
but haven't you heard?

392
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:29,820
Right. Inspector Saegusa may know about it

393
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:31,920
because he also belongs to the Takeda Squad.

394
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:33,620
What?

395
00:20:33,621 --> 00:20:35,820
"Shoji Kano" -Why's Lieutenant Kano's text mail address

396
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:38,620
listed under the alphabet "T"?

397
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:41,320
It's because Mr. Kano formerly went by the name Tsuchiya,

398
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:43,820
but he took after his wife's family name after getting married.

399
00:20:43,821 --> 00:20:45,320
Tsuchiya?

400
00:20:45,321 --> 00:20:46,621
"X"?

401
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:50,920
What's the suspect after anyway?

402
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:52,920
What grudge does he have against the people

403
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:55,020
who died in the Battle of Kawanakajima?

404
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,520
No.

405
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,620
It's not the people who died in battle, it's the "X".

406
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:01,320
Either way, it seems that Kansuke is included

407
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:05,320
in the list of people to be murdered.

408
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:07,620
Really! Where on earth were you?

409
00:21:07,621 --> 00:21:09,320
I was worried about you!

410
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:11,220
I'm sorry.

411
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:12,720
I tell you, really...

412
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:15,620
And, were you able to get in touch with Yamato?

413
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:16,920
No, not yet?

414
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:19,620
His time he's phone's been busy right through.

415
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:21,220
Investigation First Section Chief Kuroda,

416
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:24,320
we got a tip just now that a man resembling Yamato was witnessed.

417
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:28,420
I want to go and confirm it, but there's no car available.

418
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,520
Oh, good timing.

419
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,220
Morofushi, will you lend me your car?

420
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:34,620
No. I don't think so.

421
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:36,620
Is there a problem?

422
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:40,320
No. Mr. Saegusa's driving is a bit rough, you see.

423
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:41,321
Morofushi.

424
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:42,321
Yes, sir.

425
00:21:42,322 --> 00:21:45,120
This is an emergency. Let him use it.

426
00:21:45,121 --> 00:21:46,420
It's an order.

427
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:47,421
Yes, sir.

428
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:48,720
Go ahead.

429
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:50,020
Sorry. Thanks.

430
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:52,920
If the tip's credible, report back immediately!

431
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:54,421
Roger!

432
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:59,120
I'm Bishamonten.

433
00:21:59,121 --> 00:22:01,920
I shall destroy the woodpeckers.

434
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,521
I'm the God of War!

435
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:16,821
"Flow forward like the river, Yamato"

436
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:20,420
"Flow forward like the river."

437
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:21,721
Kansuke.

438
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,720
"Next Episode" -It's mail from Kansuke.

439
00:23:45,721 --> 00:23:48,120
I'm going to expose X!

440
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:51,020
How do you know about X?

441
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:52,620
X?

442
00:23:52,621 --> 00:23:54,920
That's what I thought at the time.

443
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:59,320
I didn't know The Woodpeckers Club was called X.

444
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:00,820
Kansuke.

445
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:03,420
I came to pick you up as you told me to.

446
00:24:03,421 --> 00:24:04,621
Yamato?

447
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:12,821
Next Conan, "The Darkness of the Prefectural Police (Part 3)"
