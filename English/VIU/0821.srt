1
00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:07,463
This man, have you seen him?

2
00:00:08,463 --> 00:00:11,362
Four days ago on Tuesday night.

3
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:17,963
Yes, that night, he's the perp who stole 30 million yen here in Beika.

4
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:21,562
I'm sure you already know,

5
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,262
but two hours after the robbery,

6
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:27,062
this perp Takashi Shishido died in a car accident.

7
00:00:27,063 --> 00:00:29,563
However, the 30 million that was stolen is missing.

8
00:00:33,263 --> 00:00:34,662
No good.

9
00:00:34,663 --> 00:00:37,662
I guess there'll be no good leads today either.

10
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,062
Let's try over at the station.

11
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:40,063
Okay.

12
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:45,062
Oh, it's you.

13
00:00:45,063 --> 00:00:46,862
What's up, Pops?

14
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:49,762
Did a new pachinko parlor open or something?

15
00:00:49,763 --> 00:00:51,062
You shrimp!

16
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:53,362
Dongaraji Temple called me!

17
00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:55,963
Saying that they got a phone threat.

18
00:00:57,763 --> 00:01:00,263
Dongaraji got a phone threat?

19
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:04,162
A canvas stained black with crime.

20
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:06,962
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

21
00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:08,662
The stage for today's episode is Dongaraji.

22
00:01:08,663 --> 00:01:10,662
A dangerous secret is hidden in the temple grounds.

23
00:01:10,663 --> 00:01:12,362
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,262
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:16,863
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,940
"The Secret Hidden At Dongaraji"

27
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,139
They're demanding that you stop re-construction of the temple?

28
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,539
Yes. The construction only started yesterday,

29
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,040
but I got the call late last night.

30
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,339
Hello.

31
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,339
Stop the construction immediately.

32
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,640
If you don't, you'll be cursed.

33
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,239
I also reported this to the police, but...

34
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,239
The threat of a curse isn't enough to make the police act.

35
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,539
I didn't want to risk anything happening,

36
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,539
so I had them cancel the construction just for a day.

37
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,340
And were hoping you could find whoever made the threat.

38
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,439
Sure thing!

39
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,739
You can count on me, Kogoro Mouri!

40
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,639
It bothers me.

41
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,039
I wonder what the threat to the temple is about.

42
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,739
Wait a minute!

43
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,239
Mother, you mean you're accusing me of lying?

44
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,639
How could a single person

45
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,539
appear at two different places at the same time?

46
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,140
It sounds like an interesting conversation.

47
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,739
Not really.

48
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,639
It's just that Mr. Toratani, who lives down the street,

49
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,539
was sitting in the sun at Central Park yesterday afternoon.

50
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,639
Like I said, I'm sure you mistook him for someone else, mother.

51
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,639
Because at that time, Mr. Eisaku Toratani was at West Park.

52
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,739
I saw with these very eyes of mine!

53
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:27,339
So, one of you mistook Mr. Eisaku Toratani for someone else, right?

54
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,739
But I didn't just see him.

55
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,039
Although it was from some distance away,

56
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,039
we both exchanged bows.

57
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,340
Me, too.

58
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,940
A single person is in two different places at the same time?

59
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,839
I see.

60
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,439
So, two men suddenly got flustered when they saw the construction start?

61
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,539
Yes.

62
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,139
When I passed by the temple gate of Dongaraji yesterday at sundown,

63
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,840
I saw two men there.

64
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,239
You're right.

65
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,439
We got trouble. Right, bro?

66
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,339
So, they made a phone threat demanding to stop the construction.

67
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,939
It could be them.

68
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,339
Who on earth are those two, anyway?

69
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,439
They're brothers named Kinta and Ginsuke.

70
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,140
They're the son's of Mr. Toratani, on 2nd Street.

71
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,640
Over here.

72
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,839
Just what're you doing, brat?

73
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,939
Huh?

74
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,539
What brings you here, Pops?

75
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,339
What does a detective want with us?

76
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,739
You must have some reason for not wanting

77
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,039
the construction at Dongaraji to continue.

78
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
-Huh? -Huh?

79
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,840
Did you make a phone threat?

80
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,640
I didn't make the call either.

81
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,439
I'm not finished yet!

82
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,139
Is Eisaku here?

83
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,639
What? Why are you asking about Dad?

84
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,139
I heard a mysterious story about him.

85
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,339
Yesterday afternoon,

86
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,839
he was seen at the same time by a person who claims to have seen him

87
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,240
at Central Park and another who says she saw him at West Park.

88
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,339
Ginsuke, don't tell me that you...

89
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,939
You, too, Brother?

90
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,039
I don't know what you're talking about,

91
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,839
but I can easily confirm it, if you'd let me see him.

92
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,839
He's not home.

93
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,839
Our Dad is full of energy so he likes to go out.

94
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,939
He always goes out.

95
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,839
He always goes out?

96
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,539
Never mind about your Dad.

97
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,839
I want to talk to you two!

98
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,040
Making threatening phone calls is a crime, you know.

99
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,539
You subscribe to several different newspaper companies, don't you?

100
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,939
We don't subscribe newspapers.

101
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,039
That day was special.

102
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,439
Hey!

103
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,440
At any rate, we have nothing to do with Dongaraji!

104
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,439
They seem totally guilty to me.

105
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,140
Those brothers are hiding something for sure.

106
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,539
According to the neighbors,

107
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,539
the Toratani family and Dongaraji

108
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,939
don't seem to have relationships in any way.

109
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,139
Aside from the fact that they're neighbors.

110
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,239
But there's something a bit mysterious about that house.

111
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,139
They seem to be a family of three,

112
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,539
but nobody seems to be working.

113
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,939
Eisaku seems to be an elderly, so I understand him,

114
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,339
but when it comes to the brothers Kinta and Ginsuke,

115
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,239
they have no intention of working,

116
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,440
and even if they do find work, they quit right away.

117
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,439
I wonder how they're making a living?

118
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,639
They're probably living off Eisaku's pension.

119
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,539
You mean the brothers are living off their father's pension?

120
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,239
Talk about super lazy bums, his sons!

121
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,639
What are they going to do when their dad...

122
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,739
I got it!

123
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,239
Mr. Eisaku Toratani is no longer in this world!

124
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,739
What?

125
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,039
He probably died of some sudden illness,

126
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,639
but they didn't report to the authorities.

127
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,439
Because they wanted to keeps his pension coming to them.

128
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,440
And they probably buried his corpse somewhere on the grounds of Dongaraji!

129
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,639
But the construction started

130
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,139
and since they didn't want the corpse being dug out,

131
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,339
they stopped the construction.

132
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,639
That's absurd. There are no grounds for that deduction.

133
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,939
Wait a sec.

134
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,339
If he suddenly fell ill, they would call the ambulance right away

135
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,140
before thinking about the pension, right?

136
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,139
-Those two killed him themselves! -What?

137
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,039
Because he probably reprimanded them for not working or something!

138
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,639
Talk about delusion based on delusion.

139
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,839
But, if it's to keep everyone from finding out that Eisaku died,

140
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,239
that thing can be explained, too.

141
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,839
What do you mean by that thing?

142
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,039
It seems that Eisaku was always bathing himself in the sun

143
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,839
at Central Park and West Park on sunny days.

144
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,439
So, if that habit of his is not continued,

145
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,739
people would start getting suspicious.

146
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,239
That's why they disguised themselves as their father.

147
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,139
One of the brothers appeared here,

148
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,439
and the other brother did the same thing and appeared at West Park.

149
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,439
But since the brothers didn't discuss what to do ahead of time,

150
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,640
they ended up appearing at two places at the same time.

151
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,739
Ginsuke, don't tell me that you...

152
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,839
You, too, Brother?

153
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,940
If so, it explains things.

154
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,339
Even if you want to see Eisaku, if he's no longer in this world,

155
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,939
they have no choice but to say that he's out.

156
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,939
Our Dad is full of energy so he likes to go out.

157
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,440
He always goes out.

158
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,139
What is it this time?

159
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,240
I'll bet that you killed your father, didn't you?

160
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,439
And you buried his body on the grounds of Dongaraji and hid it

161
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,340
so that you could keep on illegally receiving his pension!

162
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,439
That seems to be the story, right?

163
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,340
I feel really sorry for Eisaku who had crossed over.

164
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,539
Hey, isn't breakfast ready yet?

165
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,040
Breakfast...

166
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,639
"Eisaku Toratani (70)" -Oh, you've got guests.

167
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,540
Thank you for looking after my sons.

168
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,339
It's Dad!

169
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,539
-That's... -That's...

170
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,940
He's not a ghost. He's got legs.

171
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,639
I thought so.

172
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,539
I always tell him not to irresponsibly suspect people,

173
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,240
but you know how kids are.

174
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,639
You saw him?

175
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,639
Four days ago, on Tuesday night?

176
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,340
Yes, I think it was near Dongaraji.

177
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,039
I'm glad Eisaku was fine.

178
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,439
It's already after noon,

179
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,939
and yet he was saying something about breakfast.

180
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,939
I'm sure that the two brothers are the ones who stopped the construction.

181
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,439
But if they didn't bury the corpse, why did they stop the construction?

182
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,139
If we can't figure that out...

183
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,540
Huh? It's Officer Takagi and Officer Chiba.

184
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,339
They're looking for the missing 30 million yen, right?

185
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,039
I wonder if they got information

186
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,439
that the perp was seen somewhere near here?

187
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,939
I got it!

188
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,139
They hid the cash!

189
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,939
Huh?

190
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,339
Those Kin, Gin brothers are members of a robbery group

191
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,039
and kept the money for the perp after the incident,

192
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,640
and hid it somewhere on the premises of Dongaraji.

193
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,640
It's not impossible.

194
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,839
You subscribe to several different newspaper companies, don't you?

195
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,339
We don't subscribe newspapers.

196
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,439
That day was special.

197
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,339
So, those newspapers were those of the day following the robbery.

198
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,739
They were probably concerned about how investigations were going.

199
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,639
They tried to hide it, too.

200
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,039
That's it!

201
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,839
We've got to tell Takagi and the others about it.

202
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,140
Hey!

203
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:05,065
Apparently, the culprit Shishido fled this way after the robbery.

204
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:08,565
And he gave the money temporarily to some other member

205
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:10,965
in order to slip through police checkpoints.

206
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:14,265
That's not possible.

207
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,265
Shishido is a man who trusts no one.

208
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:18,465
So, it's unthinkable that he'd work with anyone else.

209
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:19,565
Yes.

210
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:20,865
I see.

211
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,765
So, he has no accomplices.

212
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:26,265
If the phone threat case that you're pursuing,

213
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:28,665
and the 30 million yen robbery case we're after are connected,

214
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,965
but you don't always get what you want.

215
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:33,965
Let's try the road behind.

216
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:34,966
Yes, sir.

217
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:39,465
When you think about it, it's strange.

218
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:41,565
If they hid it somewhere here,

219
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:44,565
they don't have to do something troublesome like stop the construction.

220
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:47,065
All they have to do is retrieve the cash.

221
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,366
If they're not in this together...

222
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:52,265
They snatched the money away!

223
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:53,465
Huh?

224
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:55,065
With only their father's pension,

225
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,765
they don't have enough money to play around with.

226
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:59,265
That's why they robbed the cash!

227
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:02,366
And, they hid the cash in this temple nearby!

228
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:05,465
He's in delusion mode again.

229
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:09,365
What bums to rob a robber!

230
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:10,865
I'll get them for sure!

231
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:14,865
But I don't think those brothers have the guts to commit a robbery.

232
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:16,966
People do things you'd never imagine them doing when desperate.

233
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:18,866
Pops!

234
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:22,565
Four days ago, on Tuesday night?

235
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:26,965
Didn't you see the brothers loitering around

236
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:28,565
as if hunting for prey or something?

237
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:31,565
He's turning them into some kind of hideous brothers already.

238
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:35,066
You're talking about the day that Eisaku disappeared again, right?

239
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:37,965
He disappeared?

240
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:40,165
Mr. Toratani is sort of senile

241
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,165
and sometimes wanders around town at nights.

242
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:48,465
His sons were looking around for him in that area that night, too.

243
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:52,465
They did it while they were searching for their father.

244
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,765
And hid the dough at Dongaraji!

245
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,665
They didn't hide it, they found it at Dongaraji.

246
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,165
-Yes. -Yes.

247
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,165
Found it?

248
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,665
So, they found Eisaku.

249
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,965
Sorry to have bothered you.

250
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:09,765
No problem. As long as he's safe.

251
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,166
He was at Dongaraji today.

252
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:17,665
The knapsack was being buried.

253
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,965
What're you talking about?

254
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:21,365
Burying the knapsack,

255
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:24,366
but there's nothing like that around. Right, Dad?

256
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:31,865
Burying a knapsack? Eisaku was at Dongaraji?

257
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:35,865
So those lazy no good sons had nothing to do with it to begin with.

258
00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:37,365
Don't tell me that maybe...

259
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:38,565
Hey.

260
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:41,666
The father was responsible for everything!

261
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:43,866
I thought so.

262
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,465
That deduction of yours won't work, pops.

263
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:52,265
Their father did it on impulse.

264
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,065
He robbed from a robber!

265
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:58,965
Hey! Are you there, Dad?

266
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,366
If you're around, answer us.

267
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:06,965
And he buried the cash somewhere in Dongaraji.

268
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:09,365
But the construction started

269
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:13,065
and they wanted to retrieve it but couldn't for some reason.

270
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:16,665
So, they made a threat call to stop the construction!

271
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,265
If they buried and hid the cash,

272
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:21,965
they wouldn't have said anything about it to anyone, would they?

273
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:23,466
About the knapsack.

274
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:25,566
Right?

275
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:28,865
They blurt out things that they shouldn't.

276
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:30,366
People get that way as they age.

277
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:34,466
I'll turn that old man into the police!

278
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:40,166
Well, whatever.

279
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,765
No, I can't just let him go.

280
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:45,265
Think.

281
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:48,465
Everything we need to carry on is in our hands!

282
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:52,765
The knapsack was being buried.

283
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:55,065
Maybe it was that...

284
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:57,665
And the brothers also realized it.

285
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,066
Everything falls into place!

286
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:03,566
But, why did they have to disguise themselves as their father?

287
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,965
They blurt out things that they shouldn't.

288
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:10,766
People get that way as they age.

289
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:13,566
That's what they were afraid of.

290
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:16,465
I'm starting to see the picture.

291
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:17,766
The only thing left is...

292
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:26,966
I want to talk to your Dad!

293
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,066
It probably started from here.

294
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,266
Oh, no!

295
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:00,565
Mr. Mouri.

296
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:03,065
The perp of the phone threat

297
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:05,565
and the missing 30 million yen.

298
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:09,066
I, Kogoro Mouri will solve it all at once!

299
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:17,066
In both cases the person responsible is Tora...

300
00:17:19,866 --> 00:17:21,665
Tora, tora...

301
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,066
Tiger!

302
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:26,865
Mr. Mouri!

303
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:29,965
It all happened at night four days ago.

304
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,765
Mr. Eisaku Toratani, while wandering around at night,

305
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:36,465
happened to witness a certain sight.

306
00:17:36,466 --> 00:17:41,165
He saw a man burying and hiding a knapsack in Dongaraji.

307
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,965
A knapsack...

308
00:17:42,966 --> 00:17:44,565
Shishido!

309
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:47,565
He hid the 30 million yen here?

310
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:52,065
So, he told his sons and neighbors about it.

311
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:56,265
The knapsack was being buried.

312
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:58,765
Nobody understood what he was talking about,

313
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:01,766
but his sons realized what he meant the following day.

314
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:07,065
So, something like this occurred nearby.

315
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:10,366
How envious, 30 million yen it says.

316
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:15,565
The thing that the perp stashed the cash inside the knapsack.

317
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:16,665
Dad!

318
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:21,365
Last night he buried this, didn't he?

319
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,865
That's what I said, right?

320
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:26,565
It seems the police haven't found it yet either!

321
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:30,065
You two obviously thought of robbing this.

322
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,065
Where was it being buried?

323
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:33,765
Where in Dongaraji?

324
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:35,166
Where was it, now?

325
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,565
We'll just wait until he remembers.

326
00:18:39,566 --> 00:18:42,065
His memory comes and goes.

327
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:44,565
But, if we let it go as it is...

328
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:47,165
You two were worried about a certain thing.

329
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:52,165
If Eisaku tells anyone that he witnessed a knapsack being buried,

330
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,265
it may reach the ears of the police, too.

331
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:56,565
Since you don't want this to happen,

332
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:58,465
to keep him from meeting anyone,

333
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:01,265
you confined Eisaku inside the house.

334
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,465
You confined your father?

335
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:06,965
All we did was keep him from going outside, right?

336
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:09,265
We didn't tie him up or anything!

337
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:11,265
You appeared in the park as Eisaku,

338
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:15,065
so people wouldn't think you were confining him.

339
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:18,265
Although it's amusing that you ended up in two places at the same time.

340
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:20,565
But despite all your efforts,

341
00:19:20,566 --> 00:19:24,065
the construction of Dongaraji started,

342
00:19:24,066 --> 00:19:26,665
and your treasure was in danger of being dug up.

343
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,665
Stop the construction right away.

344
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,465
If you don't, you'll be cursed.

345
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:33,366
Talk about poisoned with worldly passions!

346
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:38,865
Just as you thought, the two cases were connected after all.

347
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:40,765
And, where is the main...

348
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:43,465
I wonder where the knapsack is buried?

349
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:44,766
Where is it?

350
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:47,665
-I guess so. -I guess so.

351
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:53,665
The perp Shishido, trying to avoid the hands of the police, fled in here.

352
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:57,465
Then, hit upon the idea of hiding the cash he robbed here.

353
00:19:57,466 --> 00:20:01,766
Most naturally in a place where he wouldn't be witnessed by anyone.

354
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:06,665
Not seen by anyone?

355
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:10,065
This means that Eisaku wouldn't have been able to see it either.

356
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:12,765
-Right? -Right?

357
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:16,065
Shishido thought that if here, no one would witness him,

358
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:19,066
but Eisaku witnessed it.

359
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:22,665
There is only one such place.

360
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,265
Behind that gingko tree!

361
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:29,865
But if behind the tree, Eisaku wouldn't be able to witness it either?

362
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:32,265
That night, when Eisaku wandered off,

363
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:35,465
he didn't come directly here to Dongaraji.

364
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:36,466
Which means?

365
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:37,766
-Then, where was he? -Then, where was he?

366
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:43,665
I think that even Shishido wouldn't have thought

367
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,566
that someone would be up on the roof that late at night.

368
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:57,366
Hey, Dad! Are you there?

369
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,165
There he is, bro!

370
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,665
Don't worry us, Dad!

371
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,265
The knapsack was being buried.

372
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,965
Huh?

373
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:09,966
Let's go home.

374
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:12,565
Come to think of it,

375
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:17,165
he used to say that the sunset viewed from there is spectacular.

376
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,665
He used to go up there a lot

377
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,866
so maybe he wandered up there that night, too.

378
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:25,766
-There it is! -There it is!

379
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:31,465
That's right. It's over here.

380
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:33,665
Don't remember after you see it.

381
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:34,765
That's right.

382
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:37,066
Enough! You no good sons!

383
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:08,065
It's true.

384
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:11,565
The priest told them that he'll overlook the phone threat thing

385
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:13,066
if they work here.

386
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:24,166
I tell you to shape up!

387
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:30,966
Anyway, Eisaku looks happy.

388
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:34,665
Hey, come on. Pull yourself together.

389
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,966
Talk for yourself.

390
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:44,666
"Next Episode" -Get a hold of yourself, Dad.

391
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,966
Ai.

392
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:54,066
Okay! I'll do it!

393
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,165
They're here. Both of them.

394
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,965
Shall I have him come over here when he gets back?

395
00:23:59,966 --> 00:24:01,865
Please do that.

396
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:02,866
Yoko!

397
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,865
Asuka!

398
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:08,065
