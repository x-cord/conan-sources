1
00:00:03,508 --> 00:00:05,408
Talking of names.

2
00:00:05,408 --> 00:00:08,608
There's a strange story regarding our names.

3
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:11,008
About your names?

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,508
I heard that the birth mother

5
00:00:13,508 --> 00:00:15,308
of the late Shinichi who died in Tokyo,

6
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:17,408
was ordered to change his name just before

7
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,208
she was about to register his birth.

8
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,608
Just before?

9
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:25,508
Yes. At first, his name was the kanji character read Hitoshi.

10
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:26,908
Why was his name changed?

11
00:00:26,908 --> 00:00:28,108
If I remember correctly,

12
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:30,108
Shinichi told me that it was because

13
00:00:30,108 --> 00:00:33,508
father said that the name Hitoshi was too simple and changed it.

14
00:00:33,508 --> 00:00:35,508
It's true that there are only a few number

15
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:37,808
of strokes in the Kanji Hitoshi, so it's simple but...

16
00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:40,908
And if Takako were a boy,

17
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:43,808
the kanji character "kou" and "ki"

18
00:00:43,808 --> 00:00:45,908
would've been applied.

19
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:49,208
If Yoshiya were a girl, his name would've been Yuka

20
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:52,308
with the kanji characters "Yuten Temple" and "flower".

21
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:55,408
If Tomoaki were a girl, his name would've been Chiharu

22
00:00:55,408 --> 00:00:58,008
with the kanji characters "knowledge" and "spring"

23
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:02,308
Are the names really those that Chairman Tsunechika chose?

24
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:08,208
Yes. The late Keiji, Miwako and Saki all said the same thing.

25
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:11,808
There seems to be some kind of secret behind the names.

26
00:01:11,808 --> 00:01:15,008
-Yes. -But is it true that

27
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,708
the story about the culprit being among us, the adopted children,

28
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,508
and that the person is using the demon dog

29
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:22,608
to eradicate the bloodline of the Inubushi family?

30
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:25,108
We don't know that for sure yet

31
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:27,308
but it's for sure that someone is using a trick

32
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:30,008
to commit serial murders!

33
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:32,708
We've already got hints as to the demon dog trick

34
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,808
that's being used too!

35
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:37,308
What's with this piece of cloth?

36
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:39,208
It was on the ground near the place Tomoaki

37
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,608
was attacked by the demon dog!

38
00:01:41,608 --> 00:01:45,308
There are no burnt remains or smell of oil

39
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:48,408
but it's for sure that it was used for something.

40
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,008
If you had such evidence on you,

41
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:54,208
why didn't you take it to the police right away?

42
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,308
Ta... Takako.

43
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:59,908
We... we were just about to take it to the police.

44
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:01,808
And, Miyuki.

45
00:02:01,808 --> 00:02:04,108
The kettle was left boiling on the portable stove, you know!

46
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:06,208
Oh, I'm sorry!

47
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,408
I was planning to go right back, you see.

48
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:12,108
Okay, I guess it's time for us to go eat dinner.

49
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:13,408
I guess so. Before eating,

50
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:17,508
I'd like to ask the guys who were back at the house

51
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:19,308
what they were doing too.

52
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,408
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

53
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:25,908
You must be true to yourself.

54
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:27,408
The mystery is completely solved in.

55
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:29,508
The last chapter of the demon dog series.

56
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:31,208
He sees through the one and only truth.

57
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,208
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

58
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:36,108
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

59
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:17,074
The previous head of the household of the Inubushi family,

60
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:19,574
Tsunechika died five years ago,

61
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:24,074
and the present head, widowed Satomi is bed-ridden.

62
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:26,374
If she passes away, the vast estate

63
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:29,674
will be inherited by the eight adopted children.

64
00:04:29,674 --> 00:04:31,174
However, the adopted children

65
00:04:31,174 --> 00:04:33,974
die bizarre deaths one after the other.

66
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,374
Could it be the curse of the demon dog engulfed in flames

67
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:39,074
that is attacking the Inubushi family?

68
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:43,374
And the demon dog finally appears in front of our eyes.

69
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:45,274
What is the identity of the monster engulfed in flames

70
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:47,774
that attack humans?

71
00:04:47,774 --> 00:04:51,174
Who on earth is the one that is manipulating the demon dog?

72
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:55,274
"Inubushi Castle, The Ablazed Demon Dog"

73
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:58,274
"(Princess Chapter)"

74
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:03,474
Hey, Ran. Can you solve this problem?

75
00:05:03,474 --> 00:05:08,274
"Wear glasses and think it out" is the hint, right?

76
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,674
What're you guys doing?

77
00:05:10,674 --> 00:05:12,274
We're watching a rerun of a quiz program

78
00:05:12,274 --> 00:05:14,374
that is aired late at night.

79
00:05:14,374 --> 00:05:16,274
It's pretty interesting.

80
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,174
Why don't you go to bed? It's after 01:00 already.

81
00:05:19,174 --> 00:05:21,374
The bed is made in the guest room, right?

82
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:24,774
But, figuring that the demon dog is nearby somewhere.

83
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:27,274
We're too scared to sleep!

84
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:28,874
Come on.

85
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:31,074
Can you decipher this code then?

86
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:33,374
If you do, I'll hit the sack for you!

87
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,674
Maybe Conan can decipher it! He's wearing glasses besides.

88
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:40,474
This means that the katakana character of "glasses" (megane).

89
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:44,174
You change the "me" of this code to "ne".

90
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:46,674
The cat in the attic!

91
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:50,374
I see! Megane means glasses,

92
00:05:50,374 --> 00:05:53,774
so you gotta change "me" to "ne" and read it.

93
00:05:53,774 --> 00:05:55,874
I see.

94
00:05:55,874 --> 00:05:58,574
So, this is what the trick of the demon dog was about.

95
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:00,974
If so, the culprit is...

96
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:03,874
It couldn't be anyone else but that person.

97
00:06:03,874 --> 00:06:06,174
What? You mean, mother?

98
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:08,074
She collapsed?

99
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:12,474
Yeah. It seems that she tried to get out of under the covers.

100
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,674
Since Takako heard a strange sound in the corridor,

101
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:18,074
she went inside the room

102
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:20,474
and found Satomi lying on the floor in front of the drawer?

103
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:23,674
-Yes. -It was just when I left to go to the restroom.

104
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,974
I wonder how something like this could've happened.

105
00:06:25,974 --> 00:06:27,974
Something's on the floor.

106
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:30,274
They're the beads from the prayer beads.

107
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:36,274
Tears.

108
00:06:38,174 --> 00:06:40,174
Hey.

109
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:44,474
She holding on to eight beads.

110
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:47,874
Only the fourth bead from the top is a small bead.

111
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:52,174
Eight. Beads. Dog.

112
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:55,974
I see. It's that story.

113
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:59,274
In other words, Satomi knew...

114
00:06:59,274 --> 00:07:03,074
Who among the people here was the serial killer!

115
00:07:06,474 --> 00:07:09,074
Hey. Kazuha.

116
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:12,374
Kazuha!

117
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:14,574
What's up?

118
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:18,774
Will you go to the restroom with me?

119
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:19,774
Okay!

120
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:22,474
Geez. You're not a kid,

121
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:24,674
so can't you go to the restroom alone or what?

122
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:28,574
But, I was attacked by the demon dog in the yard here, you know.

123
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,274
If you think that it may appear in the house this time,

124
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:32,574
it's scary, right?

125
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:35,474
By the way, how come you're awake yourself, Pops?

126
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:37,774
I'll bet you're concerned too, dad?

127
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:39,574
After all you saw the demon dog too.

128
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:41,974
Sort of.

129
00:07:41,974 --> 00:07:45,074
The glasses kid and the young detective from Osaka

130
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:48,774
seem to be fast asleep, though.

131
00:07:48,774 --> 00:07:50,074
Of course!

132
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:51,574
They were saying something like

133
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:52,674
they've figured out who the culprit is so...

134
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:53,674
They've...

135
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,974
they've figured out who the culprit is?

136
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:58,174
You mean they've figured out the culprit

137
00:07:58,174 --> 00:07:59,874
that is among the adopted children?

138
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:02,574
Yes, although they didn't tell us who it was.

139
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:05,274
They seemed to have come up with a clue

140
00:08:05,274 --> 00:08:07,674
after hearing about the names of the adopted children!

141
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:09,474
Heard about the names?

142
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:12,374
Like Miyuki's name used to be Tamaki.

143
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:15,474
If Takako were to be born a boy, her name would've been

144
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:18,474
using the kanji characters "think" and "season".

145
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:21,674
If Yoshiya were born a girl, his name would've been Yuka,

146
00:08:21,674 --> 00:08:23,674
using the kanji characters of "Yuten Temple" and "flower".

147
00:08:23,674 --> 00:08:25,674
If Tomoaki were a girl,

148
00:08:25,674 --> 00:08:28,174
his name would've been meaning "know spring", pronounced Chiharu.

149
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,774
Oh, and Shinichi who died in Tokyo

150
00:08:31,774 --> 00:08:34,074
seems to originally have been named "Jin"

151
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:35,974
using only one kanji character.

152
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,574
Oh.

153
00:08:37,574 --> 00:08:40,374
I wonder if it has something to do with the prayer beads

154
00:08:40,374 --> 00:08:43,574
that Satomi was holding firmly a while ago, after all?

155
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:45,574
She was holding prayer beads?

156
00:08:45,574 --> 00:08:47,574
It seems she deliberately got out of bed

157
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:50,174
and was holding the prayer beads that she took out of the drawer!

158
00:08:50,174 --> 00:08:52,074
On top of that, the string seems to have been cut

159
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,674
and there seems to have been only eight beads on the string.

160
00:08:54,674 --> 00:08:57,674
Eight beads?

161
00:08:57,674 --> 00:08:59,674
Maybe it's some kind of fortunetelling or something?

162
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:01,374
But, I wonder if there was any type of fortunetelling

163
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,574
that used eight beads?

164
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:08,674
No. It's not fortunetelling, but rather, a story.

165
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,274
A story?

166
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:11,874
Eight beads and a demon dog

167
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:16,274
and judging from the names of the people here in the family,

168
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:19,174
the only possibility is the "Eight Dog Chronicles"!

169
00:09:19,174 --> 00:09:21,574
Eight Dog Chronicles?

170
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:23,074
What's that?

171
00:09:23,074 --> 00:09:25,774
Is it a story that'll help us find something?

172
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,774
You mean you don't know?

173
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:29,274
It's a famous novel of large volume that was

174
00:09:29,274 --> 00:09:33,774
written by Bakin Takizawa, a great writer in the Edo Era!

175
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,274
Attacked by the enemy, Yoshizane Satomi,

176
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,174
who saw the fall of the castle before his eyes,

177
00:09:37,174 --> 00:09:38,874
tells his beloved dog Yatsufusa,

178
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:40,174
"If you get me the head of the enemy Shogun,"

179
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:42,974
"I will give my daughter Princess Fuse to you."

180
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:45,074
Hearing this. Yatsufusa raids the enemy quarters

181
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:48,474
and really brings back the head of the enemy Shogun.

182
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:49,574
Princess Fuse, after saying,

183
00:09:49,574 --> 00:09:53,974
"Be it a dog, a Monarch should always keep to his words,"

184
00:09:53,974 --> 00:09:56,774
"goes along with Yatsufusa and confines herself into the mountains."

185
00:09:56,774 --> 00:09:59,574
This is how the first part of the story goes.

186
00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:02,674
What? What's with the dog?

187
00:10:02,674 --> 00:10:04,774
I guess it's cursed.

188
00:10:04,774 --> 00:10:06,374
Exactly!

189
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:08,574
The fact is, Yoshizane became the castle lord

190
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,074
after killing the treacherous retainer

191
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:11,874
who killed the original lord of the castle.

192
00:10:11,874 --> 00:10:14,774
When Tamazusa, the wife of the retainer who was killed,

193
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:17,874
was to be beheaded she left behind the following words.

194
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:21,674
"Even if I were to perish, my soul will remain as a ghostly spirit"

195
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:25,474
"and curse the Satomi family for generations to come!"

196
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:28,374
Which means that the dog was cursed

197
00:10:28,374 --> 00:10:29,974
by this person called Tamazusa?

198
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:33,774
Yeah. The curse that was placed on Yatsufusa vanished

199
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:37,774
thanks to the sutra that Princess Fuse kept reading for him but...

200
00:10:37,774 --> 00:10:39,374
And... And?

201
00:10:39,374 --> 00:10:42,074
What happened to the princess and dog after that?

202
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,674
Yoshizane orders his vassal,

203
00:10:43,674 --> 00:10:47,774
"Get rid of the cursed dog and rescue Princess Fuse."

204
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:49,974
However, Princess Fuse who tries to protect Yatsufusa,

205
00:10:49,974 --> 00:10:51,974
loses her life.

206
00:10:51,974 --> 00:10:54,474
At that time, eight beads from the prayer beads

207
00:10:54,474 --> 00:10:56,974
that the princess had on her, flew to the heavens.

208
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:59,174
Then, eight warriors with the names of a dog

209
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:01,174
from various districts caught the beads,

210
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:04,374
and each of them started off with their checkered lives from then on.

211
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:08,674
That's the way the Eight Dog Chronicles go.

212
00:11:08,674 --> 00:11:12,374
But how do the names connect?

213
00:11:12,774 --> 00:11:18,074
Each of the eight beads had one kanji character inside it.

214
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:23,374
Jin, Gi, Rei, Chi, Chu, Shin, Kou, Tei.

215
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:25,174
"Jin, Gi, Rei, Chi, Chu, Shin, Kou, Tei"

216
00:11:25,174 --> 00:11:28,474
These Jingihakou kanji characters that you see here!

217
00:11:28,474 --> 00:11:31,074
But, those kanji characters aren't included

218
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:33,274
in the names of the people of the Inubushi family!

219
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:36,774
Shinichi's name used to be "Jin" read Hitoshi,

220
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:39,774
but it seems to have been changed because the name was too simple.

221
00:11:39,774 --> 00:11:41,474
It's not because it was too simple.

222
00:11:41,474 --> 00:11:44,174
He avoided it because he didn't like, what you see is what you get!

223
00:11:44,174 --> 00:11:46,474
If you add the person radical

224
00:11:46,474 --> 00:11:49,374
to the two horizontal lines in the character "ichi",

225
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:52,574
it will make the kanji character "Jin".

226
00:11:52,574 --> 00:11:53,874
True.

227
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:56,174
I see! So, it's not what it actually looks like

228
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,674
but he divided the kanji character into parts

229
00:11:57,674 --> 00:11:59,674
and included them in the names!

230
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:02,774
In Takako's name, the top radical of the kanji character of "kou"

231
00:12:02,774 --> 00:12:04,174
and the kanji character "ko" were combined

232
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:06,074
to make the kanji character "kou".

233
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:08,274
In case she were to be a boy, the name Kouki

234
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:10,974
has the same kanji parts in it!

235
00:12:10,974 --> 00:12:14,874
Then, in Yoshiya's case, the radical and the last flick stroke

236
00:12:14,874 --> 00:12:16,074
in the kanji character "ya"

237
00:12:16,074 --> 00:12:17,374
combines to make the kanji character "rei".

238
00:12:17,374 --> 00:12:21,274
In Tomoaki's name, the hikari in his name was removed

239
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,774
to make the kanji character "chi".

240
00:12:23,774 --> 00:12:26,674
In the case of the late Keiji, the kanji character derived would be "chu",

241
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:28,874
Miwako, "gi",

242
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,874
Saki, "shin",

243
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:34,374
and Chairman Tsunechika, "tei".

244
00:12:34,374 --> 00:12:37,274
Then, Satomi is called "princess"

245
00:12:37,274 --> 00:12:38,274
because by combining the kanji character "woman"

246
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:40,174
that is at the bottom of "sato" and "mi",

247
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:42,374
the kanji character "princess" is made, right?

248
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:45,274
Right! I'm sure that Chairman Tsunechika

249
00:12:45,274 --> 00:12:47,274
loved Eight Dog Chronicles,

250
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:49,074
so he inserted the characters inside the beads,

251
00:12:49,074 --> 00:12:51,074
to the names of his children!

252
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:53,174
But what about Miyuki?

253
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:55,074
I wonder what character it is?

254
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,474
It seems the name she had before she was adopted

255
00:12:56,474 --> 00:13:00,474
was read "Miyuki" but written with one kanji character.

256
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:03,674
Then, there's no mistake who the culprit is.

257
00:13:03,674 --> 00:13:05,474
If you remove the top most horizontal line in the

258
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:06,774
kanji character "Miyuki Tamaki"

259
00:13:06,774 --> 00:13:09,274
and combine it with the name she previously had...

260
00:13:10,274 --> 00:13:11,536
It becomes "Tamazusa"!

261
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:13,674
That's the name of the ghostly spirit that cursed the Satomi family

262
00:13:13,674 --> 00:13:16,574
-in the Eight Dog Chronicles! -What?

263
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:18,074
Oh, no!

264
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:20,374
Are you saying that Miyuki is the serial killer

265
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:22,274
who is manipulating the demon dog

266
00:13:22,274 --> 00:13:24,774
and attacking the people of the Inubushi family?

267
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,260
Are you saying that Miyuki is the serial killer

268
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,060
who is manipulating the demon dog

269
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,260
and attacking the people of the Inubushi family?

270
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,960
Yeah. She's probably reenacting the role of Tamazusa

271
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,660
and each time she kills an adopted child,

272
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,360
she leaves a round thing behind at the

273
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,060
site of the crime as proof of what she did.

274
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,760
That can't be!

275
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,160
Miyuki is a nice person.

276
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,860
Just because she's a nice person,

277
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,660
it doesn't mean that she's not the culprit.

278
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,260
Oh, no.

279
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,260
Heiji! Heiji, say something!

280
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,660
Miyuki's not the culprit, is she?

281
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,860
Huh?

282
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,960
Heiji's not here.

283
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,460
-Conan's not here either! -No joke!

284
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,960
Hey.

285
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,560
Didn't Miyuki tell you that she was going to do something tonight?

286
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,660
She said that she was going to Satomi's room to vigil over her.

287
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,260
She was going to tell Satomi not to sneak out

288
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,260
from under the covers again.

289
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,360
What? Miyuki's whereabouts are unknown?

290
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,460
I thought that a vigil would be tough for her

291
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,460
so I came into the room to take her place,

292
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,260
then I found this letter.

293
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,360
A letter?

294
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,760
I will atone for all the crimes I've committed

295
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,860
in the hut where I raised the demon dog.

296
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,460
Miyuki.

297
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,560
-Oh, no. -It can't be.

298
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,260
Miyuki...

299
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,760
She is the culprit?

300
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,960
Why would she...

301
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,760
Isn't that scooter Miyuki's?

302
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,260
Hey. Don't tell me that gasoline is leaking from it.

303
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,960
And? Who's going to go check?

304
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,860
Not me!

305
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,760
I'm not going either.

306
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,360
Mr. Detective, you go.

307
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,660
If Heiji were here, I'm sure he'd charge in there.

308
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,360
True. I wonder where Conan went too.

309
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,560
-What? -Demon dog? It's appeared!

310
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,460
It's heading for the hut!

311
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,960
Hey, if the gasoline catches fire, the hut and all will blow up.

312
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,460
Conan?

313
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,160
-No good! -Run for it!

314
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,260
See, it's okay! There's nothing to be afraid of.

315
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,260
Huh? It's not burning.

316
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,860
It's just red.

317
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:15,160
Besides, what's that cloth that's on the dog?

318
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,560
-Virtual flames! -Heiji.

319
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,060
Virtual flames?

320
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,060
"Virtual flames" -It was used on the set

321
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,360
of the TV quiz program that you guys were watching too, right?

322
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,760
It's a fake flame that was created by shining red LED light

323
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,360
on glossy cloth that is made to flutter in the wind!

324
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
The same with that dog!

325
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,060
The cloth is wrapped around it so that when it runs,

326
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,460
the cloth flutters in the wind.

327
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,860
And a red LED light was wrapped into the cloth

328
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,460
to make the dog look like a demon dog engulfed in flames!

329
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,160
If you turn the light off using a remote controller,

330
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,060
the dog will vanish too, you see!

331
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,460
Then, how do you explain the fire footprints?

332
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,060
Okay, watch closely!

333
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,460
A disposable lighter is rigged

334
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,960
so that the place where the gas is in, is left opened

335
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,460
and a piano line is attached to it!

336
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,460
Which means that the thing I smelt when I fell

337
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,460
was the smell of the gas of the lighter?

338
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,960
Yeah, gas is originally odorless,

339
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,460
so since it's dangerous left that way,

340
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,260
they're made to smell like rotten onions!

341
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,060
When you guys were attacked by the demon dog

342
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,760
at the Inubushi residence,

343
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,460
because you fell, this lighter got stuck in the ground

344
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,960
and that's why the fire footprints

345
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,060
were cut off only in that spot!

346
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,060
But, no matter if gas is emitted, if there's no fire...

347
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,360
The charcoal stove that is inside the wire netting

348
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,060
on the dog's tail is what kindled the fire!

349
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,560
With this on, when the dog moves on top of the lighters,

350
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,160
the fire will grow larger and larger.

351
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,360
I'm sure that this dog wasn't attacking people

352
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,360
but rather was just following the smell of the lighters

353
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,560
that the culprit lined out on the ground.

354
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,560
But, after we were attacked in the yard of the house,

355
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,160
we saw no lighters like that on the ground.

356
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,360
The culprit set it up so that the dog could

357
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,760
hold the edge of the piano line in its mouth and return.

358
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,560
After the demon dog disappeared,

359
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,760
the clattering sound that you heard,

360
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,360
which looked like the fire was hopping was that.

361
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,160
Running with this many lighters attached to a piano line,

362
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,460
the lighters would get stuck to the bumpy ground

363
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,360
and make that sound.

364
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,060
But, when Tomoaki was attacked,

365
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,260
his arm caught fire and he got burned, didn't he?

366
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,460
Of course he got burnt.

367
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,060
Because he set himself on fire.

368
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,760
He did it in order to make it look like

369
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,560
the demon dog was really engulfed in flames!

370
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,560
Then, is Tomoaki the culprit?

371
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,460
But, wasn't he attacked by the demon dog?

372
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,160
All the dog did was pounce on its owner

373
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,160
because it was happy!

374
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,960
While we were in the hut checking things out,

375
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,060
he lined the piano line with the lighters attached to it

376
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,660
that he had hidden in his bag on the ground,

377
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,260
then, he used his dog whistle

378
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,060
to summon the dog that he had as a pet

379
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,260
and kept in another hut!

380
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,960
After frolicking with the dog

381
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,360
and falling over a blind spot of the bank,

382
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,060
he turned off the light of the dog and made it go home

383
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,660
then set fire to his arm!

384
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,760
He put the onion on the spot then,

385
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,360
to camouflage the smell that Kazuha smelt!

386
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,860
Which means that the letter left behind by Miyuki

387
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,460
that said she would atone for the crimes she committed...

388
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,560
That's probably what Tomoaki wrote!

389
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,860
In order to frame Miyuki up as the culprit!

390
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,560
Then, where is Miyuki?

391
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,960
She was put to sleep and in that hut,

392
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,260
so we moved her to another place.

393
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,460
Miyuki was looking for something over here with Tomoaki so...

394
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,360
I think she was asked to go look for Satomi's medicine

395
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,460
that Tomoaki said he dropped when he was attacked

396
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,860
by the dog or something.

397
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,260
Were... were you watching?

398
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,360
Yeah. I chased you from the house, so I figured it out right away.

399
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,560
You took Miyuki who you put to sleep, over to the hut

400
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,460
to make it look like she committed suicide

401
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,060
by burning herself along with the demon dog.

402
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,460
Oh, no.

403
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,560
No use playing dumb!

404
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,260
Because the dog will never forget its owner!

405
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,460
And the reason Hachi barks at you

406
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,360
is probably because you smell like this dog.

407
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,260
Besides, Satomi knows all about it!

408
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,560
-What? -Well, you lied saying that

409
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,460
you were by her side watching over her right through

410
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,160
to establish your alibi,

411
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,460
although it was obvious that your lie would be revealed in time.

412
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,260
Satomi was holding the black fourth bead

413
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,660
from the top of all the eight beads.

414
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,260
It corresponds to the fourth name Chi,

415
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,760
when read in order of Jin, Gi, Rei, Chi, Chu, Shin, Kou, Tei.

416
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,560
In other words, the person who comes fourth Chi, is you, the culprit!

417
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,060
The traces of tears on Satomi's cheeks was probably because

418
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,860
she wanted you to be the first to discover what she was doing,

419
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,760
so that you could turn yourself into the police.

420
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,560
It was because she didn't want you to commit anymore crime.

421
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,360
I didn't want to let go of

422
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,760
that castle-like Inubushi residence!

423
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,560
But the inheritance tax was too high.

424
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,060
That's why in order to increase the amount of inheritance, I...

425
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,760
I just couldn't give up the house filled

426
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,960
with memories of mother Satomi who was kinder than my birth mother.

427
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,860
Not that castle.

428
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,860
I just couldn't bear giving up that castle!

429
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,760
Well, I did it again, good work for me.

430
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,060
He spit everything out in the interrogation room!

431
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,960
He said he killed the four

432
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,660
because they were not cooperative to keeping the castle.

433
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:05,460
But, didn't Shinichi give up his right to inheritance?

434
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,160
He said that he wanted to make it look like

435
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,560
it was the doings of Tamazusa,

436
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,960
rather than killings committed because of inheritance trouble.

437
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
He seems to have honestly thought that

438
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,660
Miyuki was Tamazusa who came to destroy the castle.

439
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,560
Because Satomi collapsed

440
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,960
while she was out gathering mountain vegetables with Miyuki.

441
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,260
Oh, no.

442
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,660
I'll protect this castle!

443
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,360
Miyuki?

444
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,060
Because after all,

445
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,360
I'm the princess of this castle, just like mother!

446
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,760
Well, although unlike mother.

447
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,460
You're a pretty crude princess.

448
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,860
My, how rude!

449
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,860
No, you're both the same.

450
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,360
If you combine the kanji character "fuse" of Inubushi

451
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,360
and the character "hime" (princess) in your names...

452
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,260
Both are read "Princess Fuse"!

453
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,060
The sound of a piano playing.

454
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,960
Composed by Johann Sebastian Bach.

455
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,060
Air on the G string.

456
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,660
Hey, we're in trouble! The culprit's still here!

457
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,360
At any rate, we'd better get out of here!

458
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,560
But, we've got to save that boy!

459
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,260
You guys, stay close to me!

460
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,560
If we split up, we don't stand a chance.

461
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,460
Next Conan,

462
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,660
"The Secret Played by the Diary (Part 1)"

463
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,560
Next Conan's Hint:

464
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,060
"Map"

465
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,260
In the next episode, we will be challenging

466
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,860
solving the mystery evolving around a diary at a villa

467
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,860
where the sound of a piano playing is heard!
