1
00:00:02,898 --> 00:00:04,697
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,698 --> 00:00:06,897
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06,898 --> 00:00:08,697
The case of the treasure thief is solved!

4
00:00:08,698 --> 00:00:10,897
What is Ayumi's real motive?

5
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:12,397
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,398 --> 00:00:14,397
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,398 --> 00:00:16,498
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,744
We the members of the Youth Detective Squad

9
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:59,544
were taken by Ayumi

10
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:03,544
to go get a set of Girls' Festival dolls at the Kanno residence.

11
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:04,545
While we were there...

12
00:02:04,546 --> 00:02:07,644
Mr. Mizutaka Tsumagari brings an antique appraiser, Mr. Yoshiharu Mie,

13
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:10,944
with him saying that he wants to buy

14
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:13,244
the hanging scroll at a very high price, but...

15
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:16,544
Mrs. Kanno's grandma flatly refuses.

16
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:20,044
But, while we were out for shopping,

17
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:22,345
that hanging scroll disappears!

18
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:29,844
Look, the time the fax was sent out all show 15:28!

19
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:33,044
Which means that the fax kept coming in

20
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:36,844
all the while we were out shopping until we came back, right?

21
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:40,344
Do you think a burglar would break into a room

22
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:42,444
where noise is constantly coming from?

23
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:44,644
Besides, it's strange that

24
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:47,944
the burglar didn't notice her wallet

25
00:02:47,945 --> 00:02:50,144
and if the burglar couldn't find what he was after,

26
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:52,844
wouldn't all the other rooms be ransacked too?

27
00:02:52,845 --> 00:02:54,644
True.

28
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:57,244
The strangest thing is,

29
00:02:57,245 --> 00:03:00,844
why only the hanging scroll was stolen.

30
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:03,844
But, that hanging scroll is worth 20,000,000 yen.

31
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:06,844
You idiot, only a professional would know

32
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:09,644
if that scroll is really worth that price.

33
00:03:09,645 --> 00:03:10,645
Which means that

34
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:15,044
the burglar knew that the scroll was here to begin with.

35
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:16,744
Yeah.

36
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:19,244
But if the burglar was after the scroll,

37
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:21,644
the other room wouldn't have been ransacked.

38
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:24,444
Maybe the burglar messed up the other room

39
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:27,444
just to throw people off, so that he's not suspected.

40
00:03:27,445 --> 00:03:31,144
Which means the culprit has no definite alibi, and on top of that

41
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:35,444
had to face the police reluctantly after the incident.

42
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:40,545
Furthermore, that person knows the value of that hanging scroll!

43
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:48,445
"Girls' Festival Dolls in the Sunset (Part 2)"

44
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:52,744
Hey, Conan.

45
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:54,344
But in the Japanese room...

46
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:56,544
All there is the set of Girls' Festival dolls,

47
00:03:56,545 --> 00:03:57,845
and nothing else...

48
00:03:58,645 --> 00:03:59,944
Look, see!

49
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:01,644
It's changed, isn't it?

50
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:04,844
It's somehow different from how it was before we went shopping.

51
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,944
Somehow different?

52
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:08,944
It looks the same to me.

53
00:04:08,945 --> 00:04:10,744
Oh, I see!

54
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:13,044
The position of the Emperor and the Empress isn't correct.

55
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:16,144
The right and left is opposite!

56
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:17,544
Right.

57
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:19,544
It's not only those two.

58
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:21,644
Ayumi, will you get your digital camera out?

59
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:23,244
Okay!

60
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:25,744
-Here you go! -Thank you!

61
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:27,844
See. Although it's very slight,

62
00:04:27,845 --> 00:04:30,244
when you compare the picture with the one that was taken previously,

63
00:04:30,245 --> 00:04:34,544
the position of the other 13 dolls are slightly moved, right?

64
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:35,744
You're right.

65
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:40,444
It's most likely that the person who took the hanging scroll

66
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:42,744
bumped into the altar of the dolls accidentally

67
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:44,944
and the dolls fell.

68
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:46,244
I see.

69
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,344
So the person who lined the dolls back again,

70
00:04:48,345 --> 00:04:50,444
placed them in the wrong position.

71
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:53,244
And? Who's the culprit?

72
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:55,744
-Huh? -Hurry up and tell us!

73
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:57,244
Oh, well, as to that...

74
00:04:57,245 --> 00:05:00,844
I still haven't figured it out.

75
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:01,845
Is that so?

76
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:05,144
Stop talking like you got the answer then!

77
00:05:05,145 --> 00:05:08,644
The dolls look sad.

78
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:12,044
See. This doll here was smiling a bit more

79
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,844
when it was first lined up.

80
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:16,544
How dare they drop the dolls

81
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:17,844
after we went through the trouble of lining them up right.

82
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:20,044
I see! I got it!

83
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:21,344
Huh?

84
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:23,944
The burglar is somebody who doesn't know very well

85
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:26,244
how the dolls should be lined up.

86
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:29,744
The burglar is you!

87
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:32,144
Mr. Tsumagari!

88
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:34,844
I remember you said you don't have a daughter

89
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:37,544
so you're not interested in the dolls, right?

90
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,544
I see, so that's why you lined the dolls up wrong!

91
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:43,544
Please confess!

92
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:45,645
You're the burglar, aren't you?

93
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,144
No.

94
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:50,644
It's not Mr. Tsumagari!

95
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:54,344
The burglar is one of the two!

96
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:58,244
Only these two would be able to do something like this!

97
00:05:58,245 --> 00:05:59,844
But why?

98
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:03,144
Why did the person line the dolls that dropped back again?

99
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:05,544
It would've been more effective to leave the dolls as they were,

100
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:09,044
to make it look like burglary.

101
00:06:09,045 --> 00:06:10,944
Mr. Tsumagari,

102
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:13,944
will you please let me check your room out?

103
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:14,945
Huh?

104
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:17,344
Of course, I'm asking you to do it voluntarily.

105
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:19,444
Oh, all right!

106
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,344
Go on and check my room out if you want to!

107
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:23,844
I assure you that you'll find nothing!

108
00:06:23,845 --> 00:06:29,044
Oh, and I'm going to have to do a body check on all three of you,

109
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:30,244
since there is a possibility that

110
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:34,044
you may be hiding the hanging scroll somewhere in your body.

111
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:36,844
Okay, we'll get a woman officer and start right away.

112
00:06:36,845 --> 00:06:39,844
We better move fast or the sun will set.

113
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:43,044
-Yes, sir. -What? Oh, no...

114
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:45,344
It's this late already.

115
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:49,044
Are you sure that Mr. Tsumagari is the culprit?

116
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:50,544
Although you did seem really confident...

117
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:53,345
You're the one that started this whole thing!

118
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:00,944
Hey, Conan.

119
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:03,544
Did you figure out who the culprit is?

120
00:07:03,545 --> 00:07:04,545
Huh?

121
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:05,844
Oh, I'm sorry,

122
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:07,244
I'm in the process of thinking now.

123
00:07:07,245 --> 00:07:12,744
We'd better hurry or the steps will...

124
00:07:12,745 --> 00:07:14,244
The steps...

125
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:16,844
-Huh? -Thanks, Ayumi!

126
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:18,644
I've figured it out!

127
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:21,544
Really? Have you figured out who the culprit is, then?

128
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:23,944
Yeah, thanks to you, Ayumi!

129
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:27,144
I'll go get the officers then!

130
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:28,345
Ayumi?

131
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:35,344
What, you've figured out who stole the hanging scroll?

132
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:37,544
Who could've done a thing like that?

133
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:41,544
You'll find out after you come to Mrs. Kanno's room!

134
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,144
Hurry, officer!

135
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:45,345
Okay.

136
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:56,944
Please...

137
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:59,544
Please, sunset.

138
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,244
Stay still a little while longer.

139
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:03,944
Just a little while longer.

140
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:05,145
I see.

141
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,844
So this sunset was what you were waiting for.

142
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:10,744
Haibara.

143
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:13,844
Looks beautiful, doesn't it?

144
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:16,844
You seem to have an eye for these things.

145
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:18,244
Really?

146
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:21,944
So let's hurry and solve the case, bring him along!

147
00:08:21,945 --> 00:08:23,045
Okay!

148
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,344
The sunset.

149
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:36,044
It smears the world in blood.

150
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:38,145
The death throes of the sun.

151
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:44,745
I wonder how many more times I'll get to see.

152
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:49,645
This sad color.

153
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:58,744
And, who is it that solved the case?

154
00:08:58,745 --> 00:08:59,844
Don't tell me you did, Mrs. Kanno?

155
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:02,445
-Oh, no. -Me!

156
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:05,544
You, sonny?

157
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,944
Yep! I've figured it all out!

158
00:09:07,945 --> 00:09:12,844
The one who took the hanging scroll and where it is too!

159
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:16,244
The hint is the altar of the dolls!

160
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:19,244
When the thief took the hanging scroll and fled,

161
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:22,644
the thief accidentally bumped into the doll altar and the dolls fell.

162
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,244
Then when putting the dolls back on the steps,

163
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:28,244
the position of the Emperor and Empress were reversed, right?

164
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:31,844
That's why we searched Mr. Tsumagari's room.

165
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:32,845
Of all the four people

166
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:35,144
that have a motive for stealing the hanging scroll,

167
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:39,444
only he doesn't know how to line the dolls up!

168
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:42,444
-No, it's just the opposite! -Opposite?

169
00:09:42,445 --> 00:09:45,244
Take a good look at the altar!

170
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:47,244
When you compare it to the time when we lined the dolls up,

171
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:49,044
before the burglar broke in,

172
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:51,744
all of the dolls are a bit out of position,

173
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:54,044
and except for the Emperor and Empress,

174
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:56,444
all the dolls are in the correct position!

175
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:58,044
Is he right?

176
00:09:58,045 --> 00:09:59,544
Yes, he's correct.

177
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:01,244
I checked the position of the dolls

178
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:04,044
after the children lined them in place.

179
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:06,844
If the burglar bumped into the altar with enough impact

180
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:09,344
to drop the Emperor and the Empress,

181
00:10:09,345 --> 00:10:13,044
the other dolls and accessories would have fell too, right?

182
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,744
If the person didn't know how to line the dolls up,

183
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:18,644
there is no way that the dolls would be lined up as perfectly as this!

184
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:25,444
But, the burglar did actually line the Emperor and Empress up wrong.

185
00:10:25,445 --> 00:10:27,545
What if it's not a mistake?

186
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,144
What if this is the traditional way that

187
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:33,144
dolls used to be lined up in ancient times in Japan?

188
00:10:33,145 --> 00:10:35,044
The traditional way?

189
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:36,544
Yep!

190
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:39,744
Originally in Japan, the honourable seat was to the left

191
00:10:39,745 --> 00:10:41,144
and the lower seat to the right,

192
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:44,944
so the person who is higher in rank used to stand on the left.

193
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:49,144
As you can see, the elderly Minister of the Left is on the left,

194
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:52,744
whereas, the young Minister of the Right is on the right.

195
00:10:52,745 --> 00:10:54,144
So, the Emperor and Empress in accordance

196
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:56,544
to this tradition of men being higher in rank than women,

197
00:10:56,545 --> 00:11:00,444
the Emperor is on the left and the Empress is on the right.

198
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:04,044
Hey, Conan, you're wrong!

199
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:06,044
The man's on the right!

200
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:08,744
Like I've been telling you, from the view point of the dolls,

201
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:10,744
the Emperor is to the left of the Empress!

202
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:13,444
Oh, I see.

203
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:15,844
But, all the dolls decorated in show windows

204
00:11:15,845 --> 00:11:18,344
are opposite from the altar there.

205
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,444
That's because this is Tokyo!

206
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:22,444
During the Meiji Restoration, when the western custom

207
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:25,444
of the "right side being the honourable position" entered Japan,

208
00:11:25,445 --> 00:11:29,944
the position of the Emperor during the coronation also changed,

209
00:11:29,945 --> 00:11:35,045
and so followed the doll industry of Tokyo!

210
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:38,644
You sure know a lot, don't you, sonny?

211
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:43,045
Yep, I love to check out things like this!

212
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:48,844
Conan?

213
00:11:48,845 --> 00:11:51,744
I've been wanting to ask you from some time ago but...

214
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:55,744
Why do you always talk childish only when you talk to adults?

215
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:58,744
It's as you're fawning on them or something.

216
00:11:58,745 --> 00:12:00,444
Oh, yeah?

217
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:04,144
Rather, you give me the creeps.

218
00:12:04,145 --> 00:12:08,644
Okay, I will act natural like always. Satisfied?

219
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,544
I like the way you talk, it's cute.

220
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:13,445
Although it's kind of girlish, it's sweet.

221
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:18,944
So, who's the burglar, sonny?

222
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:21,544
Oh, yes. So, the burglar is someone

223
00:12:21,545 --> 00:12:24,044
who knows how the dolls used to lined up in olden times.

224
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:28,545
Either Grandma Kanno or Appraiser Mr. Mie!

225
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,099
When grandma was still a child,

226
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,499
the old way of lining up the dolls was widespread.

227
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,799
Besides, she's originally from Kyoto!

228
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,099
There are many homes in Kyoto that take traditional seriously

229
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,699
and stick to the traditional way of doing things.

230
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,699
She probably learned to line the dolls up the traditional way!

231
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,499
Mr. Mie should also know the traditional way of lining the dolls up,

232
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,599
and if he knows that those dolls are from Kyoto,

233
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,099
it's not inconceivable that he would line them up that way.

234
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,499
Does he know that those dolls are from Kyoto?

235
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,899
Because Setsuko told him so,

236
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,599
and the dolls from Kyoto have accessories

237
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,299
that are different from the dolls in Tokyo,

238
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,499
so a professional would be able to tell right off the bat.

239
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,499
So, which one of them is the burglar

240
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,299
and where is the hanging scroll?

241
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,699
Don't tell me you don't know who it is again?

242
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,399
I know who it is!

243
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,600
Because Ayumi gave me the hint, "steps".

244
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,599
Steps, don't tell me that...

245
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,199
I get it!

246
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,299
The burglar climbed the altar as if they were steps

247
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,399
and hid the hanging scroll in the cabinet above the closet!

248
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,099
And, when the burglar did so,

249
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,999
some of the dolls were kicked by the burglar's foot,

250
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,899
so the dolls fell!

251
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,999
Hey, Genta, be careful!

252
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,099
So, the hanging scroll is probably still in here.

253
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,999
It's not here.

254
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,099
Not there. In the back, behind!

255
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,799
A steps like this altar was brought out

256
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,099
and the hanging scroll was hid in the back.

257
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,599
So the dolls fell when the altar was moved.

258
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,199
The burglar wasn't aware that if you go inside the closet like this,

259
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,100
it would've been easy to hide the scroll.

260
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,499
The box for the doll set is here, but there's nothing else.

261
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,899
Maybe the dolls fell when the burglar fled, after all.

262
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,799
No... no dolls were dropped.

263
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,499
The burglar took all the dolls away from the altar deliberately

264
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,899
in order to hide the hanging scroll.

265
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,200
Took the dolls away?

266
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,900
Don't tell me that the hanging scroll is...

267
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,899
Hey, help me move the dolls!

268
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,100
Yes, sir!

269
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,299
Yes, it's a convenient place to hide paper things

270
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,399
such as hanging scrolls.

271
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,899
And yet, it's a place that's hard to find even if you search for it.

272
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,000
The place is...

273
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,299
behind the red cloth of the altar!

274
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,299
I see.

275
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,299
A place that is not visible unless all the dolls are moved,

276
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,899
is hard to reach, in other words, hard to find.

277
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,199
And, Ayumi mentioned that the dolls looked sad.

278
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,699
That's because the this wooden plate that

279
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,799
is on the top of the hanging scroll was underneath.

280
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,799
If you put the wooden place above this laughing doll,

281
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,299
it tilts forward

282
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,600
and its facial expression changes, doesn't it?

283
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,099
I see, that's why its laughing face looked a bit different!

284
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,399
But, why is it placed reversed?

285
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,399
Because the thick plate that is attached under the hanging scroll

286
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,499
cannot be covered with just the red cloth.

287
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,599
That's why it was placed upside down and hidden behind

288
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,299
the folding screen on the very top of the altar.

289
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,899
Wait!

290
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,099
If the burglar hid the hanging scroll in a place like this,

291
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,100
it means...

292
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:03,899
Yeah. After the police leave, the burglar

293
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,699
can pretend to put the dolls away

294
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,600
and also retrieve the hanging scroll.

295
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,599
Only grandma is capable of doing this, right?

296
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,699
-What? -Grandma?

297
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,199
-Oh, no! -No joke?

298
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,299
Yeah. After we left to go shopping and she was at home all alone,

299
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,799
she probably came up with the idea

300
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,699
of hiding the hanging scroll

301
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,300
and messing up the room to make it look like a burglar broke in!

302
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,099
And then she goes up shopping herself

303
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:37,299
to make it look as if a burglar broke in while she was out.

304
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,199
But, I wonder if that granny would even come across

305
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,599
the idea of a burglar opening the veranda window

306
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,500
and breaking in through the roof?

307
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,599
Well, they broadcast a lot of those kinds of programs on TV recently

308
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,299
that I'm sure grandma had seen them too.

309
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,999
I guess so.

310
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,499
But, why would she do a thing like that?

311
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,499
Don't tell me...

312
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,299
You tried to get insurance money for it

313
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,699
after making it look as if it were stolen...

314
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,200
I would never do something so evil.

315
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,699
This hanging scroll is the protective god of the Kanno family.

316
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,199
Protective god?

317
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,399
Yes. That's why I decided to hide it for now,

318
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,199
and after my son returns from work,

319
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:26,799
I was going to show him the Thunder God and tell him about it.

320
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,399
That is, not to repeat the mistake that I made.

321
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,699
Repeat? Don't tell me that...

322
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,399
Right.

323
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,599
We originally had the hanging scroll of the Wind God here too.

324
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,799
It was found in the storeroom of my husband's parental home,

325
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,199
so we're not sure where it came from but...

326
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,799
My husband used to always say,

327
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,099
"We are the Kanno family, so this hanging scroll"

328
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,299
"is most likely our protective god!"

329
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,899
Come to think of it, the Wind God and Thunder God

330
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,299
are the guardian deity of the 12 handed Goddess of Mercy.

331
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,199
When my son got married,

332
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,999
we were having trouble getting money together to buy this condo.

333
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,899
Therefore, I decided to sell the Wind God scroll.

334
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,999
I sold it secretly while my husband was on a company trip.

335
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,400
Then...

336
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,499
the passenger liner that my husband was on board sunk

337
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,299
when they encountered a typhoon

338
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,400
as if the Wind God had created.

339
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,299
Then are you saying that the cursed Wind God scroll

340
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,999
made its rounds and came to me.

341
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,199
It is not cursed.

342
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,699
Like they say the Girls' Festival dolls were originally placed

343
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,399
by the pillow of the child

344
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,299
as a protective charm to ward off evil.

345
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:53,899
Likewise, every time that hanging scroll is stained or soiled,

346
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,199
I feel that it may be warding off misfortune

347
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,400
that may befall our family for us.

348
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,100
So, please do not lay a hand on that Thunder God scroll.

349
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,699
Oh, well...

350
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,799
Now that we know it is not only very valuable,

351
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,499
but also has additional benefits,

352
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,699
the more we wouldn't mind risking our lives for it,

353
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,099
right, Mr. Tsumagari?

354
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,899
No, I'm totally satisfied with only the Wind God.

355
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,399
Forget all of this, okay?

356
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,199
My, how disappointing...

357
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,499
However, I will be back again later, Mrs. Kanno.

358
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,399
Huh?

359
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,300
To teach you an easy way to store it.

360
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,599
Let's get going too, officers.

361
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,899
I'll have to be punished for having committed this case.

362
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,900
A case?

363
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:00,899
Give me a break!

364
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,199
The owner of the house messes the room up,

365
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,899
and something disappears so there was a great fuss over it.

366
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,699
If I file this as a case,

367
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,699
I'm really going to be struck by my boss' thunder!

368
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,200
Oh, god. How frightening.

369
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,599
However, it is a fact that I scared the children.

370
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,999
I'll help you pack the dolls as a token of my apology.

371
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,799
So that you can take it home right away.

372
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,099
Oh, on second thought I'm not going to take it!

373
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,999
Maybe my Hina doll was broken

374
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,499
because it warded off evil in my place.

375
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,699
So, I'll try asking daddy again

376
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,399
if he'll get it repaired for me!

377
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,099
I'm so sorry, after you went out of your way to help me.

378
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,499
Oh no, no problem.

379
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,899
Are you sure?

380
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,599
Yep!

381
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,999
Besides,

382
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,599
the Girls' Festival doll that I really wanted...

383
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,100
What I really, really want is...

384
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,099
What I really, really want is...

385
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,599
I don't care what but...

386
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,099
You'd better hurry

387
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,499
or you're going to lose the chance to push the shutter.

388
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,400
Because it looks just great now.

389
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,499
Hey, take a look of that!

390
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,799
What a beautiful sunset.

391
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,299
I see!

392
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,299
You wanted to take a picture of this sunset, right, Ayumi?

393
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,999
Conan, you sit right here!

394
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,499
Mitsuhiko, Haibara and Genta sit one step below!

395
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,799
Here's the camera!

396
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,299
Yes, yes.

397
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,899
But, why are we facing this way?

398
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,799
You may as well take a picture with the sunset in the background

399
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,499
because it'll be a nice picture that way.

400
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,699
Oh, never mind.

401
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,199
Okay, everybody, smile!

402
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,499
The stairs are red from the sunset,

403
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,099
so with the cream-colored elevator door in the background,

404
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,399
you all look as if you're...

405
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,199
Hina dolls!

406
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,499
Huh?

407
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,299
Which means Conan is the Emperor

408
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,799
and I'm the Minister of the Right?

409
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,899
Rather, the three Court Ladies.

410
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,099
Hey, you gotta be joking!

411
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,799
No, I...

412
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,299
-Haibara, let's go up the steps! -Huh?

413
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,899
Move it, Conan!

414
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,400
No!

415
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,600
I mean, we're more like the five Musicians.

416
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,000
The tip of the rope is twisted.

417
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,000
This is part of a spider web.

418
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,699
I wonder when it stuck on...

419
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,200
Why would it be in a place like this?

420
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:23,256
Next Conan,

421
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,900
"The View Point With A Broken Fence"
