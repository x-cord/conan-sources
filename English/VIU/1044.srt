1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,499
Uncle Kogoro.

2
00:00:04,734 --> 00:00:07,233
Inspector Megure always says that

3
00:00:07,234 --> 00:00:09,933
incidents happen when we're around, right?

4
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:11,733
Yes, well...

5
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:13,734
I guess that's what they call a coincidence.

6
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:17,838
So, is that also a coincidence?

7
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:23,638
It's a coincidence, all right!

8
00:00:26,938 --> 00:00:28,537
The love for deduction and the exhilaration of

9
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:30,737
unravelling mysteries that comes before sleep!

10
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:32,237
A message in the vegetables.

11
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,837
Lit on fire with lives on the line.

12
00:00:33,838 --> 00:00:35,337
He sees through the one and only truth.

13
00:00:35,338 --> 00:00:37,137
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

14
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:39,638
His name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:22,238 --> 00:02:28,038
"The Pork Soup Is A Signal To Risk One's Life"

16
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:39,137
The victim is Lisa Hewitson, 25 years old.

17
00:02:39,138 --> 00:02:41,537
The cause of death is severe blood loss.

18
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:45,937
The estimated time of death is between 1:00 and 1:30 a.m.

19
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:48,137
Judging by the way the blood spurted out,

20
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:52,337
the culprit likely had blood spattered on his or her body.

21
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,837
I think so.

22
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:55,537
So, where's the murder weapon?

23
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:57,537
Mr. Mouri? Why are you here?

24
00:02:57,538 --> 00:02:59,738
And Conan, too?

25
00:03:00,738 --> 00:03:03,337
We haven't found the murder weapon yet.

26
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:05,537
How about fingerprints?

27
00:03:05,538 --> 00:03:07,537
We've discovered three sets of fingerprints

28
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:09,737
other than that of the victim.

29
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:11,337
I see.

30
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:13,337
Excuse me.

31
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:16,437
What was in that pouch?

32
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:19,437
The contents are on the table.

33
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:22,537
ID papers, a wallet, and a complete set of make-up

34
00:03:22,538 --> 00:03:25,737
as well as a ballpen and notebook.

35
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:29,637
There were no signs of the doorway or windows being forced open.

36
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:32,537
So, perhaps it was done by someone she knew.

37
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:34,537
In that case,

38
00:03:34,538 --> 00:03:37,738
first, we have to find out about the lovers.

39
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:44,237
Takashi Hara, 23 years old.

40
00:03:44,238 --> 00:03:45,837
We've confirmed he was romantically involved with the victim

41
00:03:45,838 --> 00:03:49,137
based on testimonies by those who know them.

42
00:03:49,138 --> 00:03:51,437
By the way, his fingerprints,

43
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:53,037
which we obtained when he broke traffic rules,

44
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:56,237
matched one of the fingerprints we found at the scene.

45
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:57,837
That can't be!

46
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,637
I can't believe Lisa was killed.

47
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:04,937
She was so lively yesterday.

48
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:08,237
So, you're saying that you were with Lisa yesterday?

49
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:10,537
I last saw her three days ago.

50
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:13,637
We were talking on the phone yesterday.

51
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:19,337
In that case, where were you between 1:00 and 1:30 a.m.?

52
00:04:19,338 --> 00:04:22,237
Last night, I was out drinking

53
00:04:22,238 --> 00:04:25,137
with my co-workers until 3:00 a.m.

54
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:26,537
By the way,

55
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:30,237
did you notice anything strange in your girlfriend lately?

56
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:31,837
Anything strange?

57
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,337
We'd like to know if there's anyone suspicious around her.

58
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:35,737
It's him!

59
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:38,537
It's Komaki, the owner of the bar where Lisa works!

60
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:40,537
She always complained to me about how she was troubled

61
00:04:40,538 --> 00:04:41,937
by how he would always flirt with her.

62
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:44,838
He has to be the culprit! You have to catch him!

63
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:48,637
Satoshi Komaki, 47 years old.

64
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:51,337
He has a history of tax evasion and attempted extortion.

65
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:53,337
There are also rumours

66
00:04:53,338 --> 00:04:55,337
that he is connected to some unsavoury people.

67
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:57,337
In addition, his fingerprints

68
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,338
were also found at the scene of the crime.

69
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:02,437
What?

70
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:07,037
Officer, you can't possibly be suspecting me of the crime.

71
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:08,937
That's not what we are saying.

72
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:12,737
It's just that one of your employees has died.

73
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:15,137
So, if you don't tell us anything...

74
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:16,937
Is that so?

75
00:05:16,938 --> 00:05:21,338
If that is the case, we'll give our extensive support.

76
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:26,237
Then, please tell us about your relationship

77
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:27,837
with Miss Hewitson.

78
00:05:27,838 --> 00:05:31,937
Well, you could say that we have a working relationship.

79
00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:35,337
In other words, a relationship between an employer and an employee.

80
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:38,137
What is it like when you are in private?

81
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,837
Instead of giving her allowance,

82
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:44,637
I would play Old Maid with her in the middle of the night.

83
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:46,437
-What? -In other words,

84
00:05:46,438 --> 00:05:50,337
you've been in Miss Hewitson's apartment. Is that correct?

85
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:52,537
Of course.

86
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:55,838
Old Maid is meant to be played in the middle of the night.

87
00:05:57,238 --> 00:06:00,437
Then, I would like to know your alibi

88
00:06:00,438 --> 00:06:02,637
for between 1:00 and 1:30 a.m. last night.

89
00:06:02,638 --> 00:06:07,638
Hey. Isn't there something else that you should be investigating?

90
00:06:09,138 --> 00:06:12,737
There is conclusive evidence left in her apartment.

91
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:14,437
Am I right?

92
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:17,737
For example, it could be a murder weapon with her blood

93
00:06:17,738 --> 00:06:20,837
or a wine bottle with fingerprints on it.

94
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:25,237
Or maybe some outerwear that belonged to the culprit.

95
00:06:25,238 --> 00:06:27,538
What are you talking about?

96
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:33,637
Do you happen to know something about the incident?

97
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:37,137
No, well... What I meant to say is...

98
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:39,837
That's it! He's the one who did it.

99
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:41,537
What do you mean by "him"?

100
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:44,337
I'm talking about that Hara kid.

101
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:48,537
He's always leering at my employees.

102
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:51,737
That's why there's no doubt that he did it.

103
00:06:51,738 --> 00:06:54,937
Aren't you jumping to conclusions a little early here?

104
00:06:54,938 --> 00:06:56,537
I'm not jumping to conclusions!

105
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:58,737
He has to be the one who did it.

106
00:06:58,738 --> 00:07:01,837
Doesn't that make you the culprit?

107
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,637
What did you say?

108
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:06,837
I believe we still haven't heard an alibi

109
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:09,737
for 1:00 to 1:30 a.m. from you yet.

110
00:07:09,738 --> 00:07:11,237
Alibi?

111
00:07:11,238 --> 00:07:12,937
An alibi?

112
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:15,537
I have one, all right.

113
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:19,037
It's a cast-iron alibi.

114
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,337
I was at home at that time.

115
00:07:21,338 --> 00:07:25,038
If you think it's a lie, you can ask my wife Mihoko.

116
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,337
Mihoko Komaki, 28 years old.

117
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:32,337
She doesn't have a criminal record.

118
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:36,437
Since she got married two years ago, she has become a housewife.

119
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:41,738
But, will the old man's wife have a reliable testimony?

120
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:48,137
The testimony may not be as authentic as it can be.

121
00:07:48,138 --> 00:07:49,337
Before she was married,

122
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:52,537
she worked alongside the victim at Komaki's bar.

123
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,637
Apparently, she was forced to marry him.

124
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:58,437
Well, it would be convenient for him

125
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:00,238
if he could get his wife to fabricate evidence for him.

126
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:04,637
I, the great detective Kogoro Mouri,

127
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:06,737
will see through the contradictions

128
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:09,438
and solve the case quickly!

129
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:18,937
Please have a seat.

130
00:08:18,938 --> 00:08:20,438
-Thank you for having us. -Thank you for having us.

131
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:23,437
Let's cut to the chase.

132
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:26,837
You are Ms. Mihoko Komaki, is that right?

133
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:29,238
Yes. Please ask me anything.

134
00:08:30,338 --> 00:08:33,237
My husband insisted that

135
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:35,337
I answer honestly so many times before.

136
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:40,738
Then, at what time did Mr. Komaki return home yesterday night?

137
00:08:42,338 --> 00:08:43,837
My husband usually comes home

138
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:48,437
around 2:00 to 3:00 a.m. after the bar closes.

139
00:08:48,438 --> 00:08:50,937
But there was a TV programme he wanted to watch yesterday,

140
00:08:50,938 --> 00:08:54,537
so he came home at 11:00 p.m.

141
00:08:54,538 --> 00:08:57,637
By the way, what was the TV programme he wanted to watch?

142
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,137
It was a news programme.

143
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,437
He said he had to watch it

144
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:06,637
since an accountant he knows was arrested.

145
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:11,337
You can watch TV programmes anywhere these days.

146
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:14,037
Even if you knew what was in the programme,

147
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:16,637
it does not become substantial evidence.

148
00:09:16,638 --> 00:09:20,237
What? Are you suspecting my husband?

149
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:23,838
My husband may look like that, but he actually hates to lie.

150
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:31,738
What? There's something on the ornament.

151
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:36,937
Is that...

152
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:38,437
A microphone!

153
00:09:38,438 --> 00:09:42,037
So, the conversation is being recorded.

154
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:46,337
Mrs. Komaki, you are a beautiful young woman,

155
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:49,737
so why are you married to a man like him?

156
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:53,338
Surely there are a lot of other, better men out there.

157
00:09:58,738 --> 00:10:02,137
We got married two years ago.

158
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:05,938
At that time, I was engaged to another man.

159
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:12,337
My fiance and I believed we were going to be married.

160
00:10:12,338 --> 00:10:13,938
But just before the wedding ceremony...

161
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:18,438
An unknown random attacker stabbed him.

162
00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:31,837
And in that incident, your fiance...

163
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:33,238
He died.

164
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:39,137
The murderer was arrested right away,

165
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,438
but I heard he died in prison.

166
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:04,237
After that, bad things kept happening around me.

167
00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:07,037
Could you give any specifics as to what happened?

168
00:11:07,038 --> 00:11:11,037
The company I worked at went bankrupt all of a sudden.

169
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:13,437
My younger sister was followed by a stalker.

170
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:15,937
My father's factory caught fire,

171
00:11:15,938 --> 00:11:19,037
and my mother fell off a train station platform.

172
00:11:19,038 --> 00:11:22,137
Is that true?

173
00:11:22,138 --> 00:11:25,037
Would I joke about something like this?

174
00:11:25,038 --> 00:11:28,137
You've had a streak of terrible luck.

175
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:30,937
The only fortunate thing was that

176
00:11:30,938 --> 00:11:34,637
no one in my family died.

177
00:11:34,638 --> 00:11:39,137
The one who helped me out when I was at rock bottom

178
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:41,038
was none other than Komaki.

179
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,437
Something isn't right.

180
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:48,937
There's a hidden microphone.

181
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:50,837
And the way she's bringing attention to things in the room...

182
00:11:50,838 --> 00:11:52,337
On top of that, she's telling us about her misfortunes

183
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:54,737
and how she met her husband...

184
00:11:54,738 --> 00:11:57,737
More importantly, her expression...

185
00:11:57,738 --> 00:12:00,237
Hey, do you love your husband?

186
00:12:00,238 --> 00:12:01,637
Pardon?

187
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,138
What?

188
00:12:04,938 --> 00:12:09,037
Of course, I love him. Why did you ask that?

189
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:10,838
So, I see.

190
00:12:12,038 --> 00:12:13,938
Don't ask such weird questions!

191
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:19,437
There's no doubt.

192
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,338
She's lying.

193
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,138
If that is the case...

194
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:33,138
"7 December"

195
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:34,438
"Incidents occurring on 7 December"

196
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:37,038
This must be it.

197
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:45,238
"From: Conan"

198
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:49,137
Uncle Kogoro is saying that the room is being bugged.

199
00:12:49,138 --> 00:12:51,437
The room is being bugged?

200
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,637
Mrs. Komaki's husband is probably the one listening.

201
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:57,337
But why would he plant a bug?

202
00:12:57,338 --> 00:13:00,037
Mrs. Komaki wants to tell the truth,

203
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:03,037
but it seems impossible with the room being bugged.

204
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:07,337
That's why Uncle Kogoro is saying that we need to find out

205
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:08,937
using methods other than speaking.

206
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:11,037
Other than speaking?

207
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:12,737
But how?

208
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:13,937
By the way, Uncle Kogoro is telling us

209
00:13:13,938 --> 00:13:17,037
to keep pretending we don't know.

210
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:21,637
You're free to love your husband, after all.

211
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:25,037
Could we ask you to do something for us?

212
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,437
Ms. Mihoko.

213
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:34,337
Could you answer the following questions with "yes" or "no"?

214
00:13:34,338 --> 00:13:35,438
Pardon?

215
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:39,838
With "yes" or "no", please.

216
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:43,838
Sure. I understand.

217
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:49,137
You're Ms. Mihoko Komaki, is that right?

218
00:13:49,138 --> 00:13:51,037
Yes.

219
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:56,237
Have you been lying about your husband's alibi in your testimony?

220
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:58,237
Of course not.

221
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:02,137
He returned home at 11:00 p.m. last night.

222
00:14:02,138 --> 00:14:04,438
I can guarantee it.

223
00:14:07,338 --> 00:14:09,637
-Well, that is... -Do you think...

224
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:12,737
your husband is involved in the current incident?

225
00:14:12,738 --> 00:14:16,737
I don't think so. The culprit has to be out there.

226
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:18,637
If that is the case, the culprit...

227
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:21,737
Madam, what makes you think so?

228
00:14:21,738 --> 00:14:25,837
-Pardon? -Is there anyone else on your mind?

229
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:28,137
Well...

230
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:30,538
that's just my opinion.

231
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,138
Mrs. Komaki.

232
00:14:35,538 --> 00:14:38,637
The police will guarantee your safety.

233
00:14:38,638 --> 00:14:41,238
Would you cooperate with us?

234
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:54,537
Oh, right!

235
00:14:54,538 --> 00:14:57,137
It's about time for my husband to come home!

236
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:59,338
I have to cook for him.

237
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,538
Mrs. Komaki?

238
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:10,038
First, I have to chop the vegetables, or else...

239
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:16,537
What on earth is going on?

240
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:19,937
Spring onion, burdock, and radish...

241
00:15:19,938 --> 00:15:23,338
I know! You're making pork soup!

242
00:15:24,938 --> 00:15:26,338
That's what you came up with?

243
00:15:28,938 --> 00:15:31,937
If she isn't, then it's a Morse code signal.

244
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:35,638
She's trying to tell us something by chopping up the vegetables.

245
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:50,337
This is...

246
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:51,937
Excuse me, Mrs. Komaki...

247
00:15:51,938 --> 00:15:53,838
Stop right there!

248
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:58,037
Don't try to get close to my wife.

249
00:15:58,038 --> 00:16:02,337
-Komaki! -You must have heard enough from her now.

250
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:06,138
If you're not going to arrest me, get out of here right away!

251
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:11,637
Madam. Here you go.

252
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,138
It's an amulet. See you!

253
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:19,137
There's no doubt Komaki is the culprit,

254
00:16:19,138 --> 00:16:20,837
but there's no evidence.

255
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:23,237
If only we had concrete evidence...

256
00:16:23,238 --> 00:16:26,037
That won't be a problem!

257
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:28,537
Mr. Mouri, what did you find out?

258
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:31,037
She was making pork soup.

259
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:34,537
After that, she would cook the rice and main dish.

260
00:16:34,538 --> 00:16:37,437
In other words, the pork soup would consist of pork belly...

261
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:39,438
Pork soup...

262
00:16:40,238 --> 00:16:42,037
Mr. Mouri?

263
00:16:42,038 --> 00:16:43,537
Officer Takagi.

264
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,637
We're going to the victim's apartment building.

265
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,438
Roger that!

266
00:16:50,038 --> 00:16:53,337
But why are we going to the victim's apartment building?

267
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:56,937
The first thing she tried to tell us about

268
00:16:56,938 --> 00:17:00,137
was the bug on the horse ornament.

269
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:02,637
She was telling us that she couldn't say things

270
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:04,237
as freely as she would have liked.

271
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:08,637
Next was the painting on the wall.

272
00:17:08,638 --> 00:17:11,437
A date was written on it.

273
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:12,438
Officer Chiba.

274
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,237
Search the internet for incidents that occurred on 7 December.

275
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:20,037
Yes, sir. Let's see...

276
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,537
This is...

277
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:23,937
The murder by that random attacker.

278
00:17:23,938 --> 00:17:26,937
The victim was most likely Ms. Mihoko's fiance.

279
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:31,237
And it's possible that the arrested culprit was falsely accused.

280
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:33,537
How did you figure it all out?

281
00:17:33,538 --> 00:17:35,438
It's the evidence.

282
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:39,537
For example, it could be a murder weapon with her blood

283
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:42,737
or a wine bottle with fingerprints on it.

284
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:45,638
Or maybe some outerwear that belonged to the culprit.

285
00:17:46,238 --> 00:17:48,737
The evidence seized in the random attacker incident

286
00:17:48,738 --> 00:17:51,838
was exactly the same as the things Komaki mentioned.

287
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:58,937
To think that the dog would bite its owner...

288
00:17:58,938 --> 00:18:01,037
What on earth are you talking about?

289
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:06,138
I'm so disappointed. I thought I taught you well enough.

290
00:18:08,238 --> 00:18:10,937
He probably left similar evidence at the crime scene

291
00:18:10,938 --> 00:18:14,937
to pin the crime on Mr. Hara.

292
00:18:14,938 --> 00:18:18,337
But for some reason, that evidence has disappeared.

293
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:20,737
This is what I meant.

294
00:18:20,738 --> 00:18:23,637
After I left Lisa's apartment,

295
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:27,737
you snuck in and took away the evidence.

296
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:28,937
Am I wrong?

297
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:30,437
It wasn't me!

298
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:32,437
Don't lie to me!

299
00:18:32,438 --> 00:18:35,337
You were desperate to tip off the police, weren't you?

300
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:37,337
I would never do such a thing!

301
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:42,938
I planted a camera inside the teddy bear on the sofa.

302
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:48,937
So, you're saying that the third set of fingerprints at the crime scene

303
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:51,237
belongs to her. Is that right?

304
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:55,137
Yes. And what she told us about her misfortunes...

305
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:57,238
Those were likely true.

306
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:02,037
For that reason, she was unable to take action.

307
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:04,237
She had been warned that her family would be in danger

308
00:19:04,238 --> 00:19:10,337
if Komaki was arrested and he found out about her betrayal.

309
00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:11,937
What a jerk.

310
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:14,237
What are you going to do to me?

311
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:18,637
I won't do a thing. You are my beloved wife, you know.

312
00:19:18,638 --> 00:19:24,137
But unfortunately, my beloved "honey" has gone missing.

313
00:19:24,138 --> 00:19:26,137
There's no point in intentionally leaving a body

314
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:29,838
when I'm being targeted by the police, after all.

315
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:34,537
By the way, what was she trying to do

316
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:36,037
when she chopped those vegetables?

317
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:39,537
That was also her way of giving us a hint.

318
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:40,837
A hint?

319
00:19:40,838 --> 00:19:44,237
What do spring onion, burdock, and radish have in common?

320
00:19:44,238 --> 00:19:45,937
That they're all ingredients in pork soup?

321
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:47,537
No!

322
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:49,337
They're all long and thin?

323
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:52,337
Yes! However, in case it didn't come across,

324
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:54,837
she started doing something else.

325
00:19:54,838 --> 00:19:57,937
You two might not have seen it because Komaki appeared at that time,

326
00:19:57,938 --> 00:20:00,137
but Conan had a look at it.

327
00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:03,138
What she was making with the vegetables she chopped was...

328
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,737
It looks like a regular old ballpen to me.

329
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:10,637
How about we disassemble it?

330
00:20:10,638 --> 00:20:12,138
All right.

331
00:20:15,438 --> 00:20:16,438
This is...

332
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:18,238
It's a receipt from the cleaners!

333
00:20:19,438 --> 00:20:22,937
We've finally found solid evidence.

334
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:26,337
If we investigate the DNA from the blood on the shirt...

335
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:28,738
The case will be solved.

336
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:31,138
Hello? This is Chiba.

337
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:34,337
What did you say?

338
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:36,637
Komaki has disappeared!

339
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:37,738
What?

340
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:42,037
Well then, do you have any last words?

341
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:44,037
Why did you kill her?

342
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:46,637
It's because she said no when I asked her out.

343
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:48,737
I had such a good offer, too.

344
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:52,237
But she just had to be loyal to that guy.

345
00:20:52,238 --> 00:20:53,937
You're the worst!

346
00:20:53,938 --> 00:20:56,937
What are you saying, you stupid traitor?

347
00:20:56,938 --> 00:20:59,837
The police will arrest you for sure.

348
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:03,937
Did you really think I only erased the evidence?

349
00:21:03,938 --> 00:21:05,237
You're bluffing.

350
00:21:05,238 --> 00:21:06,737
I told them everything!

351
00:21:06,738 --> 00:21:10,737
Even all the atrocious things you did in the past!

352
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:13,038
Is that all you're going to say?

353
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:19,237
-It's the cops! -How?

354
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:21,238
It's because the amulet worked.

355
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:30,438
Police! Don't move!

356
00:21:32,238 --> 00:21:33,438
You...

357
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:37,738
Stop right there!

358
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:44,938
You're not getting away, old man!

359
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,537
After that, investigations proved that

360
00:23:17,538 --> 00:23:20,137
Komaki was guilty of murdering Ms. Mihoko's fiance

361
00:23:20,138 --> 00:23:25,737
as well as the case involving the man thought to be the perpetrator.

362
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,937
Hello? Is that you, Ran?

363
00:23:27,938 --> 00:23:31,137
I want you to make pork soup for dinner tonight.

364
00:23:31,138 --> 00:23:34,037
What? You've finished shopping for ingredients?

365
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,937
Never mind that! Just make pork soup with them!

366
00:23:36,938 --> 00:23:39,537
I told you... Pork soup...

367
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:42,737
Pork soup with spring onion, burdock, and radish!

368
00:23:42,738 --> 00:23:44,238
I want it now!
