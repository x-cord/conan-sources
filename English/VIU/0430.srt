1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,238
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,239 --> 00:00:04,138
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:05,638
The locked door mystery of a car

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,038
that is sealed tightly with masking tape from the inside,

5
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:08,738
won't even let a tangled love affair through.

6
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:10,238
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:12,038
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,839
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,172 --> 00:01:57,771
After the battle with the Black Organization,

10
00:01:57,772 --> 00:02:00,072
we are leading a peaceful everyday life.

11
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:03,671
Then, a new student who looks just like Kir

12
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:06,371
of the Black Organization comes to Ran's class.

13
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:08,272
His name is Eisuke Hondo.

14
00:02:09,572 --> 00:02:11,871
Well, he turns out to be a great fan of Pops

15
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:13,672
and an ordinary high school klutz.

16
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:18,772
Just then, a client comes in asking Pops to look for a runaway girl.

17
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:21,172
And?

18
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:25,571
Did you two really meet on this freezing mountain?

19
00:02:25,572 --> 00:02:27,071
On the other side of that tree!

20
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:28,471
That's my car!

21
00:02:28,472 --> 00:02:30,671
Ami? Ami?

22
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:34,871
The door is sealed tight from the inside of the car with masking tape.

23
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:37,771
There is a portable charcoal stove by the passenger's seat

24
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:40,171
with burned remains of solid fuel.

25
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:44,671
In other words, this is carbon monoxide poisoning,

26
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:47,071
that was carried out by burning solid fuel in a sealed car.

27
00:02:47,072 --> 00:02:50,271
There's no doubt that she committed suicide.

28
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:51,272
No.

29
00:02:51,273 --> 00:02:54,571
This is cleverly schemed homicide that was set up to look as suicide.

30
00:02:54,572 --> 00:02:57,471
Moreover, the culprit is probably...

31
00:02:57,472 --> 00:02:58,472
that man.

32
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:05,572
"The Point of No Return (Part 2)"

33
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:08,271
So it's suicide.

34
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,871
I guess it can't be helped then.

35
00:03:10,872 --> 00:03:14,471
We will have you come in for interrogation at a later date,

36
00:03:14,472 --> 00:03:15,472
so we'll call it a...

37
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:20,671
Hey, are you all right?

38
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:23,872
Yeah, I just tripped over uneven ground.

39
00:03:28,572 --> 00:03:30,072
What is this hollow part?

40
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:35,371
From the size of it,

41
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:37,871
looks like a car was parked here.

42
00:03:37,872 --> 00:03:40,571
Strange. I wonder who parked here?

43
00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:42,471
It looks to be just about the size the rental car

44
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,272
of the man with the mustache that we drove here in.

45
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:51,071
By the way, when did you borrow the rental car?

46
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:53,071
From last night.

47
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:55,571
After the fight last night,

48
00:03:55,572 --> 00:03:59,371
she said she needed to use the car very badly today,

49
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,471
so I rushed to rent a car

50
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:04,471
because I needed to use the car today, too.

51
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:06,571
I had no idea that she was going to use the car

52
00:04:06,572 --> 00:04:08,571
for something like this though.

53
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:11,871
You must be a super scatterbrain, sir.

54
00:04:11,872 --> 00:04:14,771
If you knew that she was going to take the car,

55
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:17,972
why did you leave your important company papers inside?

56
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:24,171
I was thinking of taking it out in the morning.

57
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:27,471
What is it? The important papers of the company?

58
00:04:27,472 --> 00:04:31,271
Some documents that he has to submit to the company tomorrow.

59
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,271
He hired me to find his girlfriend who disappeared

60
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:37,071
because he needed those papers back.

61
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:39,271
But did you find them?

62
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:42,071
No. I was more concerned about her, so...

63
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:43,572
Now that you mentioned it, the documents...

64
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:49,471
Excuse me, did you find any documents in the car?

65
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:53,471
Yeah, there was an envelope in the backseat of the car.

66
00:04:53,472 --> 00:04:56,271
Yes. That's it, that's it.

67
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:59,571
So you found it. I'm glad.

68
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:00,671
Come to think of it,

69
00:05:00,672 --> 00:05:05,271
a bag that is thought to be the woman's was also in the car.

70
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:06,872
This was in her bag, too.

71
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:10,772
This is a cigarette lighter.

72
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:16,571
Why would something like that be in her bag?

73
00:05:16,572 --> 00:05:17,871
Who knows?

74
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:21,171
We can tell that she put it in her bag today,

75
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:23,871
because there was a burnt trace of the cigarette lighter

76
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:26,771
on the novel that went on sale today inside her bag, too.

77
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:28,271
But for some reason,

78
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:31,772
there are no fingerprints whatsoever on that novel.

79
00:05:32,872 --> 00:05:35,471
This is getting weirder by the minute.

80
00:05:35,472 --> 00:05:37,471
She hated cigarettes

81
00:05:37,472 --> 00:05:40,471
and used to always hide it to keep me, who is a heavy smoker

82
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:42,271
from smoking in the car.

83
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:44,671
Maybe she just did it out of habit.

84
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:47,371
You're a heavy smoker?

85
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:49,571
Yes.

86
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:52,771
May I go take a puff in the rented car?

87
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:56,171
I was refraining from smoking because of the circumstances.

88
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:57,272
Yeah.

89
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:00,272
Cigarettes.

90
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:04,172
Wait a second.

91
00:06:07,072 --> 00:06:08,072
Maybe...

92
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:10,872
Hey!

93
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:19,772
Just as I thought.

94
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:25,071
The killer is Mr. Misumi. There's no doubt about it.

95
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:27,271
Hey.

96
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:29,572
All I need to figure out now is the trick.

97
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:34,971
It hurts...

98
00:06:34,972 --> 00:06:36,971
Are you all right, Eisuke?

99
00:06:36,972 --> 00:06:38,171
See.

100
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:41,771
The first one to slip and fall at times like this is me.

101
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:44,372
Hey, your finger is bleeding!

102
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:49,671
It's probably from a shard that came from the front glass.

103
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:52,971
Wait. I have a bandage.

104
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:54,072
Show me your finger.

105
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:57,372
Okay.

106
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:12,471
It'll heal right away if you put spit on it!

107
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:15,172
But I think bandage should be used, just in case.

108
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:18,372
Put it on yourself.

109
00:07:22,872 --> 00:07:26,171
Bandage is really something, isn't it?

110
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:27,371
Why?

111
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:32,071
It helps the wound that is cut open close up in an instant.

112
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:35,472
Look. It's like there was never a wound to begin with.

113
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:40,072
Wait a second.

114
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:41,671
Don't tell me that the masking tape...

115
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:44,971
Forensic officer.

116
00:07:44,972 --> 00:07:46,371
Not you again.

117
00:07:46,372 --> 00:07:48,571
I seemed to have forgotten something in the car

118
00:07:48,572 --> 00:07:51,071
when I went in a while ago.

119
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:52,471
May I go get it?

120
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,572
Hey, kid!

121
00:07:58,072 --> 00:07:59,871
I see.

122
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:01,872
So that's the story.

123
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:06,071
Suicide.

124
00:08:06,072 --> 00:08:07,871
It was suicide.

125
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:09,671
But...

126
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:12,271
The car that Ami was in

127
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:15,871
was sealed tightly from the inside with masking tape.

128
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:17,071
And on the floor of the passenger's seat

129
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:21,271
were the burnt remains of solid fuel inside a portable charcoal stove.

130
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:23,871
That's why a deduction show by the Sleeping Kogoro

131
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:25,871
is not necessary in this case!

132
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,071
I guess so.

133
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:29,772
Too bad.

134
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:33,771
What do you mean?

135
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:36,871
You should be glad that this wasn't a homicide.

136
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:39,471
But everyone at the station is looking forward

137
00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:42,071
to watch the video of the Sleeping Kogoro!

138
00:08:42,072 --> 00:08:44,271
Can't anything be done about it?

139
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:46,071
What do you mean by that?

140
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:48,271
Pops!

141
00:08:48,272 --> 00:08:49,272
What is it?

142
00:08:49,273 --> 00:08:51,571
I noticed something,

143
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,772
so will you come with me for a second?

144
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:55,572
What is it?

145
00:08:56,872 --> 00:08:59,571
Pops! The door of this car.

146
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,771
Don't you think it's strange?

147
00:09:01,772 --> 00:09:03,071
Not really.

148
00:09:03,072 --> 00:09:06,472
The masking tape is cut, that's all.

149
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:21,372
Is something the matter?

150
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:26,771
That all absorbing attitude as if to despise everyone is indeed

151
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:28,172
the Sleeping Kogoro!

152
00:09:29,872 --> 00:09:32,471
"As if to despise everyone" is a needless remark.

153
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:35,071
But you're posing like that means...

154
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:36,671
You are...

155
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:37,771
Yeah.

156
00:09:37,772 --> 00:09:41,772
I'm going to show you the deduction of the Sleeping Kogoro right now.

157
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:44,071
-All right! -All right!

158
00:09:44,072 --> 00:09:46,171
But before that,

159
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:49,071
bring the most important person involved in this case,

160
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:53,072
Misumi, the boyfriend of the victim here.

161
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:15,531
What? Detective Mouri's deduction show?

162
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,731
Ridiculous.

163
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:19,131
Ami committed suicide, didn't she?

164
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:21,331
What on earth is he going to deduce?

165
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:23,331
I agree with you.

166
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:26,031
I've got a whole lot to deduce.

167
00:10:26,032 --> 00:10:29,331
After all, this is a homicide made to look like a suicide.

168
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:30,831
Homicide?

169
00:10:30,832 --> 00:10:32,331
What?

170
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,031
Yeah. Moreover, the killer

171
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:37,831
is the one who cracked the glass and went into the car to rescue Ami.

172
00:10:37,832 --> 00:10:40,931
He cut the masking tape off and opened the car up.

173
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,731
Mr. Atsushi Misumi,

174
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:44,332
I'm talking about you!

175
00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:48,531
Is that so?

176
00:10:48,532 --> 00:10:50,132
What an unexpected deduction!

177
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:55,131
Look. That's the Sleeping Kogoro.

178
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:57,331
He's just looking down and talking

179
00:10:57,332 --> 00:10:59,732
and there's no God descended on him, is there?

180
00:11:01,832 --> 00:11:04,231
Yes, but...

181
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:06,131
Doesn't it bother you?

182
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,531
What?

183
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:09,131
Next to Mr. Mouri...

184
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:13,131
That boy who is behind the car.

185
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:15,231
Oh, you mean Conan?

186
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:18,231
He often helps dad out during his deduction,

187
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:19,832
so he's probably standing by.

188
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:25,731
Please stop kidding, Mr. Mouri.

189
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:30,331
But I'm the very one who asked you to look for her, you know?

190
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:32,431
Then why would I...

191
00:11:32,432 --> 00:11:35,731
Because you had your reasons for needing to do so.

192
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:40,531
You had to in order to make it look like she sealed herself in the car.

193
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,731
To make it look like?

194
00:11:42,732 --> 00:11:44,331
With all due respect, Mr. Mouri,

195
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:47,431
I think that this car was sealed from the inside.

196
00:11:47,432 --> 00:11:48,931
Even the forensic officers said that the masking tape

197
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:53,131
was sealed on tightly that it was difficult to tear them off.

198
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:54,831
That's definitely true.

199
00:11:54,832 --> 00:11:57,631
But that only goes for the masking tape on the driver's seat side.

200
00:11:57,632 --> 00:12:00,731
Nobody even thought that a slit had been made to begin with

201
00:12:00,732 --> 00:12:04,431
in the masking tape on the passenger's seat side.

202
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,031
What the...

203
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:09,131
But you were watching him cut the masking tape of the door

204
00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:12,931
with a cutter knife, weren't you?

205
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,431
Yeah, I was.

206
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:19,731
I saw him undo the tape on the door by pressing on it,

207
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:23,932
and very skilfully cut the tape by pressing down on the tape.

208
00:12:26,532 --> 00:12:28,531
Tape that was very lightly sealed?

209
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:32,531
First, Mr. Misumi brings his girlfriend here with his car.

210
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:34,431
On his way here, he put her to sleep

211
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:37,231
with the sleeping drug that was inserted in the canned coffee.

212
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:41,231
Then, he carried her up and made her sit on the driver's seat

213
00:12:41,232 --> 00:12:45,731
and seals all the doors of the car with masking tape from the inside.

214
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:49,331
Then he cuts the masking tape on the passenger's seat side

215
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:52,631
following the line that joins the body of the car and the door.

216
00:12:52,632 --> 00:12:55,831
He opens the door and seals vertically cut masking tape

217
00:12:55,832 --> 00:13:00,731
over the masking tape on the body of the car.

218
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:04,131
He then burns solid fuel in the portable charcoal stove

219
00:13:04,132 --> 00:13:05,731
that is placed under the passenger's seat,

220
00:13:05,732 --> 00:13:08,732
goes out and closes the door to complete his task.

221
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:14,131
He finally goes to the car that he had brought here beforehand

222
00:13:14,132 --> 00:13:15,831
and leaves here for a while.

223
00:13:15,832 --> 00:13:18,531
He brings someone here so that they can see

224
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:24,631
that the masking tape on the driver's seat side is sealed on tightly.

225
00:13:24,632 --> 00:13:27,231
After that, he cracks the windshield and goes into the car

226
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:29,331
to cut the lightly sealed masking tape

227
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:32,231
by pressing it along with his hand.

228
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:36,131
The locked room homicide is completed.

229
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:37,731
I see!

230
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:40,531
If you want to save someone on the driver's seat side,

231
00:13:40,532 --> 00:13:44,131
it's most natural to try and open the door on the driver's seat side.

232
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:45,531
Even from the driver's side,

233
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:50,131
you could see that there was tape on each side of the door.

234
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:52,631
If the masking tape is cut by pressing down on it,

235
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,231
it will adhere

236
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:55,731
and even if it is checked later,

237
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:59,231
it would go unnoticed that only the tape there was sealed on lightly.

238
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:01,431
Yeah.

239
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:05,331
Please take a look at the cut part of the masking tape

240
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:06,831
that is sealed onto the passenger's seat side.

241
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:08,032
The cut part?

242
00:14:09,032 --> 00:14:11,731
The cut part of the masking tape sealed horizontally and vertically

243
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:13,331
is out of place, isn't it?

244
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:16,131
After cutting the horizontally sealed masking tape once,

245
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:17,731
another masking tape was vertically sealed on over it.

246
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,231
That's evidence that he cut it twice.

247
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:22,531
That's true.

248
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:25,531
Which means that the driver's seat was pulled back

249
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,331
and the crease in the top of her clothes were...

250
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:32,831
Yeah, it proves that Mr. Misumi is the one who drove here

251
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:36,731
and moved her over to the driver's seat.

252
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:38,831
Please wait a minute.

253
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:40,631
All I was trying to do

254
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:44,231
was get my girlfriend out of the car as soon as possible.

255
00:14:44,232 --> 00:14:48,631
How offending that my actions would be interpreted that way.

256
00:14:48,632 --> 00:14:50,931
You don't even have proof that I did it either.

257
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,631
Proof?

258
00:14:52,632 --> 00:14:55,031
There is a very concrete proof.

259
00:14:55,032 --> 00:14:57,531
The ashtray inside the car.

260
00:14:57,532 --> 00:14:58,831
Huh?

261
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:04,131
Remember that cigarette lighter in her bag?

262
00:15:04,132 --> 00:15:09,531
It was not only to keep Mr. Misumi from smoking inside this car,

263
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:14,931
but also to keep something else from his view until she got off the car.

264
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:17,931
That is, the message of farewell

265
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:19,632
that she hid in the ashtray.

266
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:22,631
Let's see.

267
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:25,331
"I guess you want to take me to the place where we first met

268
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:28,531
to get back how we felt for each other before,

269
00:15:28,532 --> 00:15:31,231
but I've changed.

270
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:32,631
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,331
Ami."

272
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:37,631
Which means that she's the one who changed.

273
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:42,531
And you're the one who brought her to the place you both first met.

274
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:45,631
If the one who wrote this is the victim,

275
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:47,131
this would serve as proof.

276
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:50,231
It's a trap! This is a trap that Ami set up!

277
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:53,731
She made it look like I killed her and committed suicide!

278
00:15:53,732 --> 00:15:55,231
Even for the slit in the masking tape,

279
00:15:55,232 --> 00:15:57,931
if she assumed that I would use the cutter knife,

280
00:15:57,932 --> 00:16:00,631
she could've put it into the dashboard beforehand.

281
00:16:00,632 --> 00:16:04,231
And as for that message, she could've written it to frame me.

282
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:06,831
The message is not proof.

283
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:10,732
The point is the book cover with the message written on it.

284
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:13,731
As you can see,

285
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:17,031
that is a paper cover that the bookshop covers the book with.

286
00:16:17,032 --> 00:16:19,331
It was probably from the book that was released today

287
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:23,231
that was found inside her bag.

288
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:29,031
No fingerprints were found on that book because you wiped them off.

289
00:16:29,032 --> 00:16:30,631
You did this because your fingerprints

290
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:34,632
would be on it after giving it to her.

291
00:16:36,532 --> 00:16:41,331
However, it seems you absentmindedly forgot and didn't wipe everything off.

292
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:46,731
That is, the fingerprints on the book cover that she wrote the message on

293
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:49,831
and secretly hid in the ashtray.

294
00:16:49,832 --> 00:16:52,331
Now, I'd like to ask you.

295
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:53,931
If you woke up this morning

296
00:16:53,932 --> 00:16:56,031
and found that she had left along with the car,

297
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:57,831
how can there be your fingerprints

298
00:16:57,832 --> 00:17:02,131
on the book cover that was released today?

299
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:07,831
But you can't tell if the cover came from that book that was in her bag.

300
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:12,631
Books are all different sizes, even if they belong to the same series.

301
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:17,131
A cover that matches the exact size is very rare.

302
00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:18,631
If you want, shall we go together to the book store,

303
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:21,631
which address is written on the cover?

304
00:17:21,632 --> 00:17:24,831
I'm sure they'll testify

305
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:26,931
that the man who bought the book this morning had bloodshot eyes,

306
00:17:26,932 --> 00:17:29,831
haunted by the crime he was planning to commit.

307
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:31,932
In other words, you.

308
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:41,031
Bloodshot eyes?

309
00:17:41,032 --> 00:17:45,131
Wrong, Mr. Detective.

310
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:48,731
I must've looked sad and wretched.

311
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:53,531
Because I figured that it was the last wish from the woman I loved.

312
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:57,831
So you did get the novel that she asked you for.

313
00:17:57,832 --> 00:17:59,031
Yes.

314
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:03,931
Just as you expect, my fingerprints are on the book cover.

315
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:07,031
I've always done as she asked.

316
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:12,731
Yes, I granted her every wish just as she wanted me to.

317
00:18:12,732 --> 00:18:14,631
If she told me she wanted to go on a trip,

318
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:16,731
I would take time off from work and take her.

319
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:19,131
If she told me she wanted to see a popular concert,

320
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,832
I would stand in line all night and get her a premier ticket.

321
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:25,131
The same with this car.

322
00:18:25,132 --> 00:18:27,231
She said that she wanted to drive it,

323
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,031
so I bought it despite having to borrow money.

324
00:18:30,032 --> 00:18:34,931
Yes. I felt as if I were her prince.

325
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:38,931
But I finally realized that I had made a mistake.

326
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:41,831
She didn't consider me her prince.

327
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:44,131
I was no more than a servant to her.

328
00:18:44,132 --> 00:18:46,631
A servant?

329
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:49,231
I found a cigarette in the car.

330
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:51,731
It was a brand that I don't use.

331
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:55,431
She never let me smoke one cigarette when I rode with her.

332
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:57,631
Don't tell me that she was cheating on you?

333
00:18:57,632 --> 00:18:59,031
Yes.

334
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:00,331
When I pressed her for an answer,

335
00:19:00,332 --> 00:19:05,631
she confessed that she used to often go driving with that guy in this car.

336
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:08,931
She even laughed about it!

337
00:19:08,932 --> 00:19:12,131
I felt really stupid

338
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:15,031
thinking that I kept paying back the loan for the car

339
00:19:15,032 --> 00:19:17,531
for a guy I didn't even know.

340
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:20,831
Is that why you committed the crime?

341
00:19:20,832 --> 00:19:22,631
Yes.

342
00:19:22,632 --> 00:19:24,031
But please believe me!

343
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:27,731
Officer, I really loved her!

344
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:31,031
I didn't come here just to commit the crime!

345
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:33,631
It was for her as well.

346
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,431
I was full of regret.

347
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:39,231
I wished that she were still alive.

348
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:42,331
That's why I cracked the windshield with the metal bat with all my might.

349
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:43,932
Okay, that's enough.

350
00:19:47,632 --> 00:19:51,531
I don't know what went on between you and her,

351
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:56,031
but one thing for sure is that, the "love" between you both was gone.

352
00:19:56,032 --> 00:19:57,131
What?

353
00:19:57,132 --> 00:20:00,831
If you really wanted to save her,

354
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,231
you would've intuitively carefully cracked the rear window

355
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:07,631
or the side window on the passenger's seat side from behind.

356
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:12,431
But you broke through the front window,

357
00:20:12,432 --> 00:20:16,432
because you knew that the glass shards would cut her.

358
00:20:17,432 --> 00:20:22,531
You already knew that she was dead.

359
00:20:22,532 --> 00:20:25,031
You wanted to crush everything, didn't you?

360
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:29,032
The memories together with her along with this car.

361
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:05,231
Well, just as expected of the Sleeping Kogoro!

362
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:08,131
The great deduction that echoed throughout the snowy mountains of Gunma!

363
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:11,731
I'm going back to the station and watch the video right away.

364
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:13,631
Suit yourself.

365
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,431
I don't remember a thing.

366
00:22:16,432 --> 00:22:18,431
This is how I land up after all.

367
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:19,831
What?

368
00:22:19,832 --> 00:22:22,032
Only the first part is taken.

369
00:22:23,432 --> 00:22:24,731
I see!

370
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:28,031
I was shooting the film using pause to save tape.

371
00:22:28,032 --> 00:22:31,331
So he forgot to turn pause off.

372
00:22:31,332 --> 00:22:34,332
Mr. Mouri, why don't we go back for a retake?

373
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,631
What an idiot.

374
00:22:37,632 --> 00:22:42,431
But this case was solved thanks to Eisuke.

375
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:45,531
Because you mentioned about the bandage.

376
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:49,331
Then, Conan noticed that the masking tape on the car was strange

377
00:22:49,332 --> 00:22:51,532
and went to tell dad about it, right?

378
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:54,631
Sort of.

379
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:57,431
You were outdone in your own forte, weren't you?

380
00:22:57,432 --> 00:22:58,631
Huh?

381
00:22:58,632 --> 00:23:00,531
In his own forte?

382
00:23:00,532 --> 00:23:02,931
It's usually this boy's role.

383
00:23:02,932 --> 00:23:05,531
He mentions something that seemingly has nothing to do with the case,

384
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:09,031
but it coincidentally turns out to be the key to solving the case.

385
00:23:09,032 --> 00:23:10,032
Don't tell me...

386
00:23:12,232 --> 00:23:15,131
He does?

387
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:16,432
Don't tell me...

388
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,432
Don't tell me that he...

389
00:23:23,332 --> 00:23:26,531
Well, if you want to see the Sleeping Kogoro again,

390
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:29,331
you can come over anytime you like.

391
00:23:29,332 --> 00:23:30,332
Really?

392
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:33,431
I did it!

393
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:35,732
Ouch...

394
00:23:39,132 --> 00:23:40,632
I guess not.

395
00:23:43,132 --> 00:23:44,932
"Next Episode" -Singles party?

396
00:23:48,832 --> 00:23:51,731
The atmosphere doesn't look too good, does it?

397
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:53,631
It's starting to get interesting.

398
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,632
Is he your younger brother?

399
00:23:58,432 --> 00:24:02,231
And if the culprit cannot find what he is after,

400
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,832
the next action he would take is...

401
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,632
A kidnapping.

402
00:24:07,732 --> 00:24:13,132
Next Conan, "Love Story at Headquarters 7 (Part 1)"

403
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:31,431
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:31,432 --> 00:24:33,131
"Rare card."

405
00:24:33,132 --> 00:24:34,531
Give me that card, Mitsuhiko.

406
00:24:34,532 --> 00:24:36,431
-No way. -I want it, too!

407
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:37,632
Here you go.
