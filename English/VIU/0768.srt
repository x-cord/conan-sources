1
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:17,907
"Shoddy Construction at the Airport Village."

2
00:00:32,147 --> 00:00:33,794
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

3
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:35,727
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

4
00:00:35,847 --> 00:00:39,494
An unexpected trick transcending time and space that confuses Haibara.

5
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:41,094
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:41,214 --> 00:00:42,894
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:43,014 --> 00:00:45,481
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,917
"Ai Haibara is Held in Captivity."

9
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,652
Haibara was nowhere to be found.

10
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:42,597
If she went shopping she would've been through long time ago.

11
00:02:42,717 --> 00:02:44,551
I wonder what happened?

12
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:47,351
If something happened,

13
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:50,319
it had to have happened on her way back.

14
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:56,652
-Maybe she was run over? -No way!

15
00:02:56,784 --> 00:02:59,084
I can't imagine that happened to Haibara.

16
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:04,664
A railway crossing accident?

17
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,451
No way!

18
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:23,831
-A muffler? -It's so small!

19
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:26,565
It has nothing to do with Haibara, does it?

20
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:27,785
No.

21
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,651
It belongs to the kitten that liked Haibara a lot.

22
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:42,797
How cute.

23
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:44,004
"Naoshi, Mitsuru Higaki."

24
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:47,729
Midoridai. Midoridai. There are places where the space between...

25
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,384
What are you looking at kitty?

26
00:03:50,817 --> 00:03:54,117
-It's a terrarium. -Is there something there?

27
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:57,718
It come out.

28
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,152
Oh! It's an Indian Star Turtle.

29
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:04,498
What a beautiful pattern.

30
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:07,764
Wasn't there an import restriction on it?

31
00:04:07,884 --> 00:04:09,997
No need to worry.

32
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,517
"Mitsuru Higaki (38)" -I bought it at a legitimate shop.

33
00:04:12,984 --> 00:04:15,398
What a surprise.

34
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:17,752
Chiro seems to like you a lot.

35
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:25,231
Hey, kitty!

36
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:28,818
-Chiro, where are you? -In here!

37
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:35,818
-It fell. -I'm glad we found her.

38
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:44,764
No one seems to be home.

39
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:48,051
We went out of our way to bring the cat back, and yet...

40
00:04:48,884 --> 00:04:51,565
It seems Haibara's not here either.

41
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:54,252
The curtains are closed too.

42
00:04:57,451 --> 00:04:58,790
What's up?

43
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:01,818
I wonder if it's hungry...

44
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:05,818
So, all we got is one kitten?

45
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:10,964
I wonder where Haibara went?

46
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:13,164
Maybe she was kidnapped?

47
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:16,498
"I got the girl, so bring the cash!" Like so.

48
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:21,486
If so... Maybe the culprit thought this house was loaded?

49
00:05:22,518 --> 00:05:26,052
Okay, I got it. Thanks, Officer Chiba.

50
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:30,119
There haven't been any reports in this area from this morning.

51
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:35,551
I'm sure she'll try to contact us if anything came up.

52
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:40,198
Haibara, everybody's worried!

53
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:41,485
Contact us!

54
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:50,284
I wonder what happened to me.

55
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,484
Where am I?

56
00:05:56,518 --> 00:05:59,752
It's already this late?

57
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:03,319
I've been asleep for 5 hours.

58
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:10,784
Indian Star Turtle.

59
00:06:11,318 --> 00:06:13,318
It's Ms. Higaki's house.

60
00:06:15,518 --> 00:06:17,651
That's right, I...

61
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:32,418
Chiro?

62
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:36,198
Your muffler got stuck,

63
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:39,152
I'll remove it for you right away.

64
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:41,651
See. Stay still.

65
00:07:12,518 --> 00:07:13,518
Ma'am?

66
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:16,218
Midoridai, Midoridai.

67
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:21,019
This train will remain for five minutes to wait for the express train.

68
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:24,331
"Murder in the Shin-Chitose Airport General Purpose Restroom?"

69
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:26,451
"Naoshi Higaki (42)"

70
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:30,150
Higaki? Don't tell me that...

71
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:34,685
I've got to calm down.

72
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:39,284
I've got to pull free somehow!

73
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:41,984
Thank you for the meal.

74
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:45,451
I'm full. I'm really full.

75
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:51,251
Why don't we try going over to the Higaki residence once more with her?

76
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,498
Nobody was there, you know.

77
00:07:53,618 --> 00:07:55,664
Maybe they came home already, right?

78
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:58,131
True, it's better than just staying here.

79
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:01,018
-Let's go! -Yes.

80
00:08:10,518 --> 00:08:12,185
It came off!

81
00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:14,751
Help!

82
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:18,651
The culprit's still here!

83
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:44,705
Nobody's home after all?

84
00:08:44,963 --> 00:08:46,096
What?

85
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:52,439
Yeah. I rang the bell six times but no answer.

86
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:57,972
Give me a break. Mrs. Higaki told me to come at this time and yet...

87
00:08:58,438 --> 00:08:59,585
I've got no choice.

88
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,784
Can you tell her that I'll be back later, Chiro.

89
00:09:02,904 --> 00:09:03,937
See you.

90
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:08,739
He tells the cat to relay the message and left.

91
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:12,405
It's Officer Chiba!

92
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:16,151
Oh, just a while ago

93
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,021
we got a lost and found that may be of some concern

94
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:21,221
from the police box on Airport Blvd.

95
00:09:21,238 --> 00:09:23,839
The Youth Detective Squad badge?

96
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:28,871
Right, a truck driver who was fixing a flat tyre in the area picked it up

97
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:30,971
and turned it in.

98
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:39,473
Everybody's worried!

99
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:41,539
Contact us!

100
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:43,439
"The Youth Detective Squad."

101
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:52,252
It's pretty far. We've been driving for about an hour already.

102
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:55,306
Accurately, it's been 50 minutes!

103
00:09:55,904 --> 00:09:59,385
It's the police box near the intersection of Airport Blvd.

104
00:09:59,505 --> 00:10:01,985
We'll get there in about two or three minutes.

105
00:10:02,105 --> 00:10:05,439
You mean she came this far? Haibara?

106
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:08,872
It's quite unthinkable.

107
00:10:09,672 --> 00:10:13,552
It's near the airport and yet a new residential district's been built.

108
00:10:13,672 --> 00:10:17,318
Seems like the selling point are convenience and complete sound proof.

109
00:10:17,438 --> 00:10:19,765
There's the police box!

110
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:20,909
"The Airport Village."

111
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,266
What a big sign.

112
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,173
Practically all of them seems to have been sold.

113
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:27,639
This is it.

114
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:30,505
No doubt about, it's Ai's!

115
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:34,884
I'm sure that she was kidnapped and threw this out along the way!

116
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:37,352
To let us know where she is!

117
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:41,406
But we haven't even been contacted by the culprit yet,

118
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:44,739
so it's too early to conclude that this is a kidnapping case.

119
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:05,707
This is the key for the handcuffs?

120
00:11:06,438 --> 00:11:09,105
Ma'am. Is the culprit here?

121
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:13,639
Is this the key for the handcuffs?

122
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:16,971
Ma'am, can you bend down?

123
00:11:19,038 --> 00:11:21,272
Stay still okay?

124
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:44,805
Thank you, Ai. I'll untie you right away.

125
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:56,905
Police. Is anybody home?

126
00:11:59,772 --> 00:12:02,306
This is the Mitsuru Higaki residence, isn't it?

127
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:04,605
What's wrong?

128
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:16,238
The fact is I'm here to check on things here on request of the HPD.

129
00:12:16,372 --> 00:12:18,118
It's been quite a misfortune, hasn't it?

130
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,652
No, never mind me, but my husband, Naoshi...

131
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:24,339
Has the culprit who killed my husband been arrested?

132
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:26,771
No, unfortunately.

133
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:31,438
An investigator is heading over here from Hokkaido regarding this.

134
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:34,918
I don't know anything.

135
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:37,772
I was tied up right through in this house, you see.

136
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:42,505
Well, all I want to ask you is about Mr. Higaki's acquaintances.

137
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:46,039
Yes, if it's about that.

138
00:12:46,472 --> 00:12:49,318
Talk about unlucky.

139
00:12:49,438 --> 00:12:51,252
Are you feeling better?

140
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:55,806
Yes, but I'm sorry to have worried all of you.

141
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:58,784
No, it's great that you're safe.

142
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,151
Some shopping experience it was.

143
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:03,205
Is this a coincidence?

144
00:13:03,705 --> 00:13:06,639
The lady really went through a terrible coincidence.

145
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:11,452
To think that her husband was killed while the house was being robbed.

146
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:15,273
Yes. I found out about the case on TV.

147
00:13:15,605 --> 00:13:18,485
But, I couldn't move at all.

148
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:20,772
Just like Ai over there.

149
00:13:21,271 --> 00:13:23,085
-Haibara. -What?

150
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:26,073
You said a terrible coincidence, right?

151
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:30,518
Do you really think so? You think that all that's a coincidence?

152
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:31,805
What?

153
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:41,239
Why did the robber do what the robber did to you back then?

154
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:44,285
If left as it is, people would've thought the resident wasn't home.

155
00:13:44,405 --> 00:13:47,939
Besides, why were you put to sleep twice?

156
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:51,685
Did the robber stay that long in this house?

157
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:56,185
The robber was having trouble opening the safe.

158
00:13:56,305 --> 00:14:00,305
-She's the one who said that, right? -Right.

159
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:04,839
When you were put to sleep the second time, what was she doing?

160
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:06,271
What?

161
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,006
I'm asking if you saw the robber and that lady at the same time.

162
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:12,505
Help!

163
00:14:14,338 --> 00:14:16,338
The culprit's still here!

164
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:19,751
I couldn't have.

165
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:22,051
I was covered with a towel from right behind me

166
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:24,751
and my vision was blocked right away.

167
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:27,871
More so, I didn't have the composure to be worried about anybody else.

168
00:14:28,971 --> 00:14:31,305
Not even a tinge! Don't tell me you think that lady is...

169
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:39,639
You suspect that she's playing both of the role, don't you, Edogawa?

170
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,304
-What? -That's ridiculous.

171
00:14:42,638 --> 00:14:46,239
But why would she do something like that?

172
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:52,006
Maybe she used me to establish her alibi for murder.

173
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:55,552
Robber and murder.

174
00:14:55,672 --> 00:14:58,518
Haibara got messed up in it.

175
00:14:58,638 --> 00:15:03,239
Maybe it was no coincidence, but actually a put-up-job.

176
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:09,385
Are you saying Chiro was used to set me up as a witness for her alibi?

177
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:11,518
If she made a round trip to Hokkaido

178
00:15:11,638 --> 00:15:14,805
after putting you to sleep, she wouldn't be suspected.

179
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:19,318
-What if she set up a plan like that? -It can't be.

180
00:15:19,438 --> 00:15:22,585
Because she couldn't have committed the crime.

181
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:26,472
It's only an hour and a half if you take a direct flight to Shin-Chitose.

182
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:31,372
From here to the airport. Just how long does it take?

183
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:35,161
If you take a car from here, it's an hour,

184
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:37,585
so all together it would take about two hours and a half!

185
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:42,418
If it's two hours and a half one way, then a round trip would take...

186
00:15:42,538 --> 00:15:43,805
Five hours!

187
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:48,159
The time she had to wait for the victim to come to the airport

188
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:51,104
and time to kill him would also have to be calculated.

189
00:15:51,405 --> 00:15:54,751
It would take at least five hours and a half.

190
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,071
No, but...

191
00:15:57,305 --> 00:16:03,605
After I woke up, I saw the lady a little after 14:00.

192
00:16:04,904 --> 00:16:08,552
I was only asleep at most only for five hours.

193
00:16:08,672 --> 00:16:13,839
It also bothers me that your badge was found on Airport Blvd.

194
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:21,472
That's right, the door chime!

195
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,406
Somebody came to the door and rang the door chime.

196
00:16:24,772 --> 00:16:27,373
It was about 14:30!

197
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:33,672
It came off!

198
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,784
It's back then!

199
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:39,238
Right, the liquor delivery!

200
00:16:49,705 --> 00:16:51,406
Nobody's home after all?

201
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:53,071
What?

202
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:56,485
Yeah. I rang the bell six times but no answer.

203
00:16:56,605 --> 00:17:01,685
Wait! Six times? I heard only two times.

204
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:04,352
And not successively but slowly!

205
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:06,073
What?

206
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:10,505
Just as I thought!

207
00:17:11,372 --> 00:17:13,285
What do you mean?

208
00:17:13,405 --> 00:17:15,551
The door chime and station announcement were all recording

209
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:18,685
that the culprit had set up beforehand.

210
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,805
If so, everything falls into place!

211
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:25,972
I sort of get the idea of what you're thinking now, Edogawa.

212
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:30,338
You think that there were two Higaki residences, right?

213
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,540
What?

214
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:36,185
What're you talking about?

215
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,552
I see.

216
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:40,159
There's not enough time because we're thinking a round trip

217
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:41,685
from here to Hokkaido was made.

218
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:44,152
But, if the place where Haibara woke up

219
00:17:44,171 --> 00:17:46,472
was at another house near the airport then...

220
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:49,818
You mean the place that was on the sign!

221
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:53,018
The Airport Village near the airport?

222
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:57,639
If Ai was held captive in one of those houses, then...

223
00:17:58,138 --> 00:18:01,352
The time to go to the airport won't have be considered!

224
00:18:01,472 --> 00:18:03,639
It's two hours saved!

225
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:05,155
The explanation to the trick of giving the impression that

226
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:08,205
two houses seemed to be one is the turtle.

227
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:10,938
Because you can take the terrarium along!

228
00:18:11,372 --> 00:18:13,818
At the same time that the liquor delivery man was asked to come,

229
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:17,338
the recorded chime is rung at the fake house!

230
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:23,139
I was put to sleep two times so that she could move me and the turtle.

231
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:28,585
But, how can you prove that there were two houses?

232
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:31,372
This is a big place.

233
00:18:32,938 --> 00:18:36,884
The goal is right before our eyes! Can you remember anything else?

234
00:18:37,004 --> 00:18:38,238
Well...

235
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:41,371
Chiro.

236
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:51,439
I'm glad I drank it all!

237
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:56,671
I wonder what that was.

238
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:05,205
The can that rolled turned to a different direction?

239
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,438
"Shoddy Construction at the Airport Village."

240
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:13,985
Yes. When I woke up again, that can didn't move at all.

241
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:16,606
I got it! That's got to be it!

242
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,985
Genta, lift up the edge of the table a bit, will you.

243
00:19:21,105 --> 00:19:22,772
Okay.

244
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:27,239
-Like this? -Good. Watch.

245
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,204
See, it turned to another direction, right?

246
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:39,739
What does this have to do with Haibara's story?

247
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:42,751
This is what Edogawa's getting at!

248
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:44,352
"Plastic Bottles Roll Continuously Across the Floor."

249
00:19:44,472 --> 00:19:47,239
The floor is like a slide.

250
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:56,418
We found out right away from the property developers list.

251
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:58,638
I'll send you the picture of this house.

252
00:20:03,305 --> 00:20:06,305
It's true that you're unlucky.

253
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:11,359
To think that the house that you bought and renovated

254
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:13,739
was made under shoddy construction.

255
00:20:28,071 --> 00:20:31,972
Was Officer Takagi at the Airport Village?

256
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:35,784
Shoddy construction is a crime, you see.

257
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:39,138
Officer Takagi just happened to be there.

258
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:43,340
Super good job, Youth Detective Squad!

259
00:20:43,638 --> 00:20:45,472
Aye!

260
00:22:10,805 --> 00:22:13,651
Her motive was really something plain and common,

261
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:15,872
a crime committed by an estranged wife.

262
00:22:16,138 --> 00:22:18,818
Is that so?

263
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:22,772
Which means that she had her eyes on Ai to begin with?

264
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:24,619
Yes. It seems so.

265
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:26,651
Because Ai's intelligent and strong-willed.

266
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:30,418
She used to see Ai scold you a lot, Dr. Agasa,

267
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:32,872
and figured Ai may serve as a great witness.

268
00:22:34,238 --> 00:22:37,238
I wonder if she used to scold me that much?

269
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:41,118
Well, will you please tell the members of the Youth Detective Squad

270
00:22:41,238 --> 00:22:43,784
that the case was closed?

271
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,471
-Okay. -Bye, then.

272
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,305
Hey, Haibara.

273
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:58,173
What's up? Smiling like that?

274
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,405
Well...

275
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:04,171
-What? Tell me, tell me! -Well...

276
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:09,339
What? Really?

277
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:10,939
I'm glad!

278
00:23:11,338 --> 00:23:13,418
-Shall we go then! -Yes!

279
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:14,872
Yes!

280
00:23:17,505 --> 00:23:21,439
That Haibara is cheerfully laughing and running...

281
00:23:21,772 --> 00:23:23,106
Hey!

282
00:23:23,405 --> 00:23:27,072
-Wait! Tell me too! -It's a secret.

283
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,872
Hey, wait!

284
00:23:29,138 --> 00:23:33,472
Seems like they found a foster home for Chiro and the turtle.

285
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:39,938
The owner maybe a culprit, but the pets aren't to blame for it.

286
00:23:42,871 --> 00:23:47,751
"Next Episode."

287
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:50,305
Stay away! Stay back.

288
00:23:50,505 --> 00:23:52,006
Cool it!

289
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:54,452
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

290
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:55,872
Darn!

291
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,707
This is a trace of sudden acceleration...

292
00:24:03,672 --> 00:24:04,872
This is...

293
00:24:05,438 --> 00:24:06,838
Just as I thought!

294
00:24:07,505 --> 00:24:11,039
Next Conan, "A Troublesome Emergency Patient".

295
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:30,485
Next Conan's Hint:

296
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:32,506
"Clipping."

297
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,118
Thanks for everything.

298
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:36,518
I'd help you any day, anytime, Haibara.

299
00:24:36,638 --> 00:24:37,805
Thank you...
