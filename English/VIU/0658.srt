1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,920
I'm so excited!

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,220
To think that we get to eat the chocolate of Yukihiko Tsujimoto

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,520
that won the silver award at a world contest!

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,220
Ms. Mayuko Sakura who produced the shop

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,120
is young and beautiful, isn't she?

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,820
They say that Mr. Tsujimoto

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,420
couldn't have succeeded without her, you know.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,920
And, they're getting married too.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,520
They sure are meant for each other.

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,420
A world renown chocolatier and...

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,920
A beautiful shop producer join to create...

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,820
A love-romance chocolate.

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,620
If you eat it with the one you love,

14
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,320
that love will be realized.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,620
How wonderful.

16
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,620
All out girl-talk.

17
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,220
I would've loved to eat it with Makoto.

18
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,920
Who cares, anything delicious makes you happy

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,020
no matter who you eat it with.

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,920
Come on, I'll bet you want to eat it

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,520
with Shinichi too, don't you?

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,220
No, it's not that.

23
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,120
The fact is you're going to be eating it with me.

24
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,720
If all cases were men,

25
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,620
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

26
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,120
Enveloped in flames of love.

27
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,920
Chocolate ignites the fuse of the case.

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,520
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,420
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,920
His name is Detective Conan.

31
00:02:56,722 --> 00:03:02,022
"Hot Chocolate Trap"

32
00:03:07,822 --> 00:03:09,722
Hi, Mayuko, long time no see.

33
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,922
Thank you for inviting us.

34
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:14,322
Welcome to Le Tresor de Fruits,

35
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:15,922
we've been waiting for you.

36
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:18,822
What a nice shop!

37
00:03:18,822 --> 00:03:22,022
Thanks to the all out support of the Suzuki Financial Company,

38
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:26,322
"Sakura Mayuko (25)" -I was able to get together top class items.

39
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:27,822
We're opening tomorrow,

40
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:30,222
so you're our very first customers, Sonoko.

41
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:34,122
Are we able to eat Mr. Tsujimoto's chocolate at the shop too?

42
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:38,422
Our concept is to serve freshly made chocolate.

43
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:41,922
Um, are those bottles liquor?

44
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:45,822
That's called Nahureka.

45
00:03:45,822 --> 00:03:50,022
It's liqueur made by soaking fruit into strong liquor.

46
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:54,222
They all look so pretty and delicious.

47
00:03:54,222 --> 00:03:57,622
Really! So much so, that I want to leave them untouched.

48
00:03:57,622 --> 00:03:58,822
All the chocolate in our shop

49
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:02,022
is made to resemble the shape of a jewel.

50
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:06,122
The name of this shop means "Treasure Fruits" in French.

51
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:08,422
What is this one with the fruit on it?

52
00:04:08,422 --> 00:04:10,422
The fruit part of the liqueur that on the shelf

53
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:12,522
was made into chocolate.

54
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:14,522
Well, would you like to taste it?

55
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:17,122
But I can't take liquor.

56
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:18,222
No need to worry.

57
00:04:18,222 --> 00:04:20,622
Because all the alcohol has evaporated.

58
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:23,722
Then, let's take a bite of adult taste.

59
00:04:25,622 --> 00:04:26,722
It's delicious.

60
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:29,322
Ran, maybe the love of your dream will come true.

61
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:31,522
Okay then, I'll try one too.

62
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,422
Delicious.

63
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:43,022
"Tsujimoto Yukihiko (41)" -Welcome to our atelier Le Tresor de Fruits!

64
00:04:43,022 --> 00:04:46,022
He's the chocolatier, Yukihiko Tsujimoto.

65
00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:48,922
Congratulations to your winning the Golden Award!

66
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,922
It's an honor to see you.

67
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:54,722
Merci, same here.

68
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:59,122
It's perfectly delightful to be told so by such lovely girls like you.

69
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:02,522
What a fake.

70
00:05:02,522 --> 00:05:04,122
Let me introduce you.

71
00:05:04,122 --> 00:05:05,922
She's Ms. Mouri.

72
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:07,322
How do you do?

73
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:09,322
And she's Ms. Suzuki,

74
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:11,722
daughter of the Suzuki Financial Company.

75
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:13,322
How do you do?

76
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:15,822
Enchante Madmoiselle.

77
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:18,522
Just as expected, you're a noble and refined lady.

78
00:05:18,522 --> 00:05:21,622
Come, this way.

79
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:24,422
I've got to make preparations, so if you'll excuse me.

80
00:05:25,422 --> 00:05:28,022
Please enjoy yourselves to your heart's content.

81
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:32,322
Okay, we'll start preparations.

82
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:34,422
Because we would like you to taste the masterpiece

83
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:35,622
that won us the Golden Award that will be

84
00:05:35,622 --> 00:05:38,822
publicized tomorrow to the media at the grand opening of the shop.

85
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:40,022
All right,

86
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:43,222
maybe you'll also be announcing your wedding.

87
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:45,922
That's a secret.

88
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:48,422
Come on, how lucky.

89
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:52,022
A rich girl.

90
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:54,922
She's just a high school brat.

91
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:59,522
Well, if I can get that girl to like me,

92
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:02,922
it should be easy to get the tycoon to dish out money.

93
00:06:05,522 --> 00:06:08,322
Hey, Sonoko, just what do you think you're doing.

94
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:10,622
The last picture of me being single.

95
00:06:10,622 --> 00:06:12,922
I mean, Mr. Tsujimoto's so attractive.

96
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:16,422
Oh? He's not quite what I imagined him to be.

97
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:19,322
I think Mayuko's way better.

98
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:21,722
So, let's get started.

99
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:29,722
We'd like to commence

100
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:34,622
the opening ceremony of Le Tresor de Fruits.

101
00:06:34,622 --> 00:06:39,022
And here's chocolatier, Mr. Yukihiko Tsujimoto

102
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:41,922
who won the honorable Golden Award in the world contest.

103
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:48,622
How beautiful.

104
00:06:48,622 --> 00:06:51,622
This is the chocolate named "dans le space" (To space),

105
00:06:51,622 --> 00:06:54,722
shown for the first time in Japan.

106
00:06:57,422 --> 00:07:00,022
The ingredients used are cacao made of premium grade

107
00:07:00,022 --> 00:07:02,022
Criollo seeds and cocoa powder butter.

108
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:04,422
Liqueur that is made of fruit that is carefully selected

109
00:07:04,422 --> 00:07:07,822
bring out the utmost flavor of the chocolate.

110
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:09,922
It looks like a sculpture.

111
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:12,122
Really, how wonderful!

112
00:07:13,122 --> 00:07:15,922
But, the show is just starting.

113
00:07:17,122 --> 00:07:19,722
Let me take you on a journey beyond your dreams,

114
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:23,022
to the distant Milky Way.

115
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:32,822
Is it the flame of love?

116
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:34,522
This is...

117
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:43,722
-Run for it! -Sonoko?

118
00:07:50,222 --> 00:07:52,322
Ran, call the fire station!

119
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:53,922
You run for it too, Conan!

120
00:07:53,922 --> 00:07:55,122
Yukihiko!

121
00:07:55,122 --> 00:07:56,922
Everybody, run outside!

122
00:07:59,922 --> 00:08:01,322
Conan!

123
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:04,722
Conan.

124
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:22,022
And, did you figure out what caused the fire?

125
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:23,922
We're still checking

126
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:25,822
but it seems that the fire

127
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:28,322
was ignited by the liqueur inside the bottles that fell off this shelf

128
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:29,922
that had a high concentrate of alcohol and spread.

129
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:32,222
Inspector Yuminaga.

130
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:34,722
She is the joint manager, Ms. Mayuko Sakura.

131
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,422
Could you explain how the fire started?

132
00:08:37,422 --> 00:08:40,622
The chocolate fruit liqueur suddenly caught fire.

133
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:42,922
Mr. Tsujimoto who was surprised

134
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,222
bumped into the shelf and the bottles fell.

135
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:47,622
Then... Tsujimoto...

136
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:50,022
The contents seem liqueur

137
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:53,022
made by soaking a fruit called Nahureka in spirytus.

138
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:57,822
Spirytus? You mean vodka with an alcohol concentrate of 96%?

139
00:08:57,822 --> 00:09:00,222
Inspector, we've found that the clothes

140
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:02,022
that Mr. Tsujimoto was wearing

141
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:04,322
was made of extremely flammable pile fabric velvet.

142
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:07,422
It's my fault.

143
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:11,522
I'm the one who chose the fabric for his new cook's coat.

144
00:09:11,522 --> 00:09:14,622
I had no idea that something like this would happen.

145
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:18,022
Mayuko, let's go over there and rest a while, okay?

146
00:09:18,022 --> 00:09:21,022
You don't mind, do you? Inspector Yuminaga.

147
00:09:21,022 --> 00:09:22,522
No.

148
00:09:22,522 --> 00:09:26,622
Inspector, is it possible that the fire was ignited by static?

149
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:30,222
The alcohol of the liqueur that vaporized

150
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:32,422
ignited from static of the outfit.

151
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:35,722
Mr. Tsujimoto who was surprised bumped into the shelf,

152
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:39,722
then the bottles fell and the alcohol spread over the floor,

153
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:42,022
causing an outburst of fire.

154
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:46,022
Furthermore, the fire spread over to Mr. Tsujimoto

155
00:09:46,022 --> 00:09:48,722
who was wearing a flammable outfit?

156
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,822
Mr. Inspector, don't you think that it's too early to conclude that

157
00:09:52,822 --> 00:09:54,522
it was an accident caused by static electricity,

158
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:56,522
just because you can't find anything else?

159
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:58,822
Keep your nose out of the investigation, brat!

160
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:00,822
Hey, brat!

161
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:02,722
Wrong. Back then,

162
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:04,122
the fire broke out as soon as it touched the liqueur,

163
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:06,622
and a huge blaze went up immediately.

164
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:10,622
The shells of pistachio nuts?

165
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:12,622
Why would something like this be here?

166
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:16,322
Over here too.

167
00:10:16,322 --> 00:10:20,122
Maybe the shells were placed under the bottles of Nahureka

168
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:23,222
so that they would crack easily.

169
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,122
Brat, don't make me repeat myself.

170
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:28,522
The crime site's not a park, you know.

171
00:10:28,522 --> 00:10:30,822
Mayuko, does it hurt?

172
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:32,822
What seems to be the matter?

173
00:10:32,822 --> 00:10:37,522
When the fire spread, it burned Mayuko's sleeve too.

174
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:39,822
I'm just fine.

175
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:42,222
I put the fire out right away by myself, you see.

176
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:46,222
Uh, why did Mayuko's clothes burn too?

177
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:48,622
We're all virtually not burned.

178
00:10:48,622 --> 00:10:50,522
True. Just to be sure,

179
00:10:50,522 --> 00:10:53,922
will you please explain what happened back then?

180
00:10:53,922 --> 00:10:55,522
When the fire spread

181
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,822
and I was about to flee together with Sonoko

182
00:10:57,822 --> 00:10:59,922
and the others, my sleeve suddenly caught fire.

183
00:10:59,922 --> 00:11:02,422
Sparks of fire probably came flying.

184
00:11:02,422 --> 00:11:06,922
Which means that Ms. Sakura, you were not near Mr. Tsujimoto?

185
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:07,922
No.

186
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:10,422
I'm sure that after giving the silver pot

187
00:11:10,422 --> 00:11:13,122
to Mr. Tsujimoto, she came over to where Sonoko was.

188
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:15,722
It's true that back then,

189
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:18,622
Mayuko was near Sonoko right through.

190
00:11:18,622 --> 00:11:22,122
Come to think of it, after Mr. Tsujimoto poured

191
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:23,622
the water into the container of chocolate,

192
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:25,622
his facial expression looked strange.

193
00:11:26,622 --> 00:11:30,222
It looked as if something he didn't expect had happened.

194
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:34,222
Inspector, this was found near the corpse.

195
00:11:34,222 --> 00:11:35,922
What's this?

196
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:38,522
It's the burnt remains of steel wool.

197
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:40,122
Steel wool?

198
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:42,922
Why would something like this be here?

199
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:46,422
A pot scrubber was made of steel wool was found in the kitchen.

200
00:11:46,422 --> 00:11:49,922
Sir, what's this?

201
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:52,522
-What is it, sonny? -What is it now?

202
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:55,622
It looks to be a non-woven fabric.

203
00:11:55,622 --> 00:11:58,522
This is material that is used to make packaging materials.

204
00:11:58,522 --> 00:12:02,322
It's usually used as bags for deodorants.

205
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,322
You sure know a lot, don't you, sonny?

206
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:06,422
Don't you think it's strange, though?

207
00:12:06,422 --> 00:12:09,822
Why would something like deodorant be here?

208
00:12:09,822 --> 00:12:13,322
Deodorant was also found inside the refrigerator in the kitchen.

209
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:15,322
It's probably the same thing.

210
00:12:15,322 --> 00:12:16,522
Nothing's strange about something

211
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:18,822
that was in the kitchen being here, is there?

212
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,922
So, out you go!

213
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:22,922
Yes, sir.

214
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:27,122
No, wrong. If that was a deodorant bag.

215
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:34,922
There's something crystallized in the pot. Is it salt?

216
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:39,222
I get it. Salt, deodorant, steel wool...

217
00:12:40,322 --> 00:12:43,322
Just one more, if that piece is found.

218
00:12:43,322 --> 00:12:44,922
Inspector.

219
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:48,122
It would be safe to say that the fire was caused by static electricity.

220
00:12:48,122 --> 00:12:51,622
We found that Mr. Tsujimoto's scarf was made of nylon fabric.

221
00:12:51,622 --> 00:12:53,222
I see.

222
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,222
Nylon material when combined with cotton fabric

223
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:57,522
such as velvet

224
00:12:57,522 --> 00:13:00,922
is prone to cause static electricity.

225
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:02,422
So, it's been concluded that this was an accident

226
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:04,022
caused by static electricity.

227
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:06,722
I still think it's better that you go to the doctor to be examined.

228
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:08,722
I'm fine, no big deal.

229
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,822
-But... -Hey, Inspector,

230
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:13,122
just how long do you intend to keep people who are hurt go untreated?

231
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:15,422
Yeah... I guess we now have an idea

232
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:17,622
of the cause of the fire, so I think it's okay to let you go.

233
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:19,322
No good. If things are left as is,

234
00:13:19,322 --> 00:13:22,022
this case will be closed as a simple accident.

235
00:13:22,022 --> 00:13:24,522
Let's go, Mayuko.

236
00:13:24,522 --> 00:13:29,122
If my deduction is correct, I'm sure it's still here.

237
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:32,422
Oh no! Ants are by the chocolate

238
00:13:32,422 --> 00:13:33,722
that is evidence of the case.

239
00:13:33,722 --> 00:13:35,922
Really?

240
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:38,222
Huh? There aren't any.

241
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:42,922
Strange. I'm sure I saw a black one moving.

242
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,622
Don't you think that you should take the evidence

243
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:47,722
and store it before ants get to it?

244
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:50,022
Maybe so...

245
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:57,089
No doubt about it, this is not an accident.

246
00:13:57,122 --> 00:13:59,622
It's a carefully schemed homicide.

247
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:07,824
Come, Mayuko.

248
00:14:07,824 --> 00:14:09,024
Okay.

249
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:12,524
Come to think of it, where did that glasses brat go?

250
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:22,424
Wait a sec!

251
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:23,924
Sonoko?

252
00:14:23,924 --> 00:14:25,924
I've figured out

253
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:28,624
the trick that killed Mr. Tsujimoto.

254
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:31,124
Hey, sis, this is an accident.

255
00:14:31,124 --> 00:14:32,524
There's no mistake to conclude that

256
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:34,924
static electricity caused the fire.

257
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:36,924
Inspector, how gullible, too sweet.

258
00:14:36,924 --> 00:14:37,924
Too sweet?

259
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:40,824
Sweeter than chocolate with a lot of milk in it!

260
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:44,824
Okay, then tell me of that trick you have in mind.

261
00:14:44,824 --> 00:14:46,824
That's more like it.

262
00:14:46,824 --> 00:14:49,524
First, I'll start with what the real cause of the fire was.

263
00:14:49,524 --> 00:14:52,524
I'll explain the trick of how the fire started.

264
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:55,924
Of all the evidence that was found on site,

265
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:58,124
there are three things that served as the key.

266
00:14:58,124 --> 00:15:02,724
The deodorant, the salt crystal and foil.

267
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:06,724
The salt crystal and foil? Just what're you getting at?

268
00:15:06,724 --> 00:15:09,724
The salt crystal was inside the silver pot.

269
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:10,824
As for the aluminium foil

270
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:13,424
you took it a while ago.

271
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:15,724
Together with the melted chocolate.

272
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:17,324
Oh, here it is.

273
00:15:17,324 --> 00:15:18,524
True.

274
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:21,524
I'll entertain you a bit now, then.

275
00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:23,724
Conan, will you get that for me!

276
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:28,124
Okay. Since Sonoko told me to, I made this.

277
00:15:29,124 --> 00:15:31,324
Ran, will you please pour water in the teapot

278
00:15:31,324 --> 00:15:34,724
into all the aluminium cups except for the one at the very top?

279
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:35,824
Okay.

280
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:41,224
Oh, that's enough.

281
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:54,124
What?

282
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:55,724
This is a remake of the ignition device

283
00:15:55,724 --> 00:15:58,324
that was used in the incident.

284
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,524
What on earth is going on?

285
00:16:01,524 --> 00:16:04,024
There is steel wool underneath the folded crane.

286
00:16:04,024 --> 00:16:07,724
It's bright red... Is that how the crane burned?

287
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:12,224
There's activated carbon in the cup below.

288
00:16:12,224 --> 00:16:15,324
And, the water in the pot is salt water.

289
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:18,424
I see, an air cell.

290
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:20,924
It's a phenomenon in which a chemical reaction occurs

291
00:16:20,924 --> 00:16:23,624
when aluminum is mixed with salt water to produce electricity.

292
00:16:23,624 --> 00:16:26,824
The same resources necessary to make the air cell

293
00:16:26,824 --> 00:16:29,024
has been found at the site, you know!

294
00:16:29,024 --> 00:16:31,324
Now, we know what generated the electricity,

295
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,724
but what caused the fire?

296
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:38,624
Inspector, when electricity goes through steel wool it ignites, you know.

297
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:42,324
In other words, the cause of the fire wasn't static electricity,

298
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:45,824
but rather, an ignition device that was made by using all these resources.

299
00:16:45,824 --> 00:16:49,424
Ms. Mayuko, what was supposed to happen

300
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:51,124
to the swan chocolate after water

301
00:16:51,124 --> 00:16:53,124
was poured inside it to begin with?

302
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:54,524
Well...

303
00:16:54,524 --> 00:16:56,624
Back then, Mr. Tsujimoto said,

304
00:16:56,624 --> 00:17:00,224
"Let me take you on a journey to the distant Milky Way."

305
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:01,924
If I'm not mistaken, to start with,

306
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:04,724
there was dry ice inside it.

307
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,224
When the water was poured in, white fog

308
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:10,124
was supposed to drift out causing an illusionary Milky Way performance.

309
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:12,724
But the culprit, in place of the dry ice

310
00:17:12,724 --> 00:17:15,924
set up an ignition device using air cells.

311
00:17:15,924 --> 00:17:17,924
However, Mr. Tsujimoto totally unaware

312
00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:19,924
of this poured the salt water in himself.

313
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:22,324
The electricity passed through the steel wool and caught fire,

314
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:25,524
then the fire spread to the fruit liqueur making things worst.

315
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:27,324
But if Mr. Tsujimoto, wasn't so surprised by the fire,

316
00:17:27,324 --> 00:17:30,224
and bump into the shelf, that made the bottles fall,

317
00:17:30,224 --> 00:17:33,524
the fire wouldn't have spread as much as it did.

318
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:36,424
The bottle was rigged to begin with pistachio nuts

319
00:17:36,424 --> 00:17:39,724
placed under it so that it would crack easily.

320
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:43,324
It's true that pistachio nut shells were found on the shelf.

321
00:17:43,324 --> 00:17:44,424
What?

322
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:47,424
But that's not all the trap that the culprit set up.

323
00:17:47,424 --> 00:17:49,724
Something else was set up from the very beginning.

324
00:17:49,724 --> 00:17:51,124
What?

325
00:17:51,124 --> 00:17:54,124
Ran, try hard and remember.

326
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:57,524
Back then, was Mr. Tsujimoto that surprised

327
00:17:57,524 --> 00:17:59,424
just because the fruit liqueur caught fire?

328
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:02,824
Hold it... The fruit liqueur caught fire

329
00:18:02,824 --> 00:18:06,024
and Mr. Tsujimoto bumped into the shelf.

330
00:18:06,024 --> 00:18:09,624
That's right. But before that a big blaze went up for an instant.

331
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:11,924
What? Are you sure about that?

332
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:16,424
Yes. After that the bottle fell causing a large blaze.

333
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:19,124
Therefore, I think my memory was a bit mixed up.

334
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:20,924
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:23,624
Oh, well, at a scene where something like that happened,

336
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:25,224
it can't be helped.

337
00:18:25,224 --> 00:18:28,924
But, how was that large blazed caused?

338
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:31,124
The culprit placed a paper container

339
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:33,924
with spyritus inside it under the table.

340
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:37,024
That way, alcohol can be made to vaporize in the space

341
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:40,424
that is covered by the tablecloth and spread throughout.

342
00:18:40,424 --> 00:18:43,624
And just before the show if the tablecloth

343
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:46,124
is flipped up to release the vaporized alcohol.

344
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:50,124
It'll ignite to the fire of the fruit liqueur which caused the outbreak.

345
00:18:50,124 --> 00:18:54,124
Ms. Mayuko, you were fixing the tablecloth

346
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:56,124
before the show began, weren't you?

347
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:57,624
Right.

348
00:18:57,624 --> 00:19:01,424
Ms. Mayuko Sakura, the culprit is you!

349
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:06,324
Oh no... Ms. Mayuko is?

350
00:19:06,324 --> 00:19:08,924
Ms. Sonoko, please cut out your jokes.

351
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:11,724
I got burnt like this too, didn't I?

352
00:19:11,724 --> 00:19:12,924
No,

353
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:17,224
that's indeed evidence of you being the culprit.

354
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:21,924
Your sleeve got burnt when you set the liqueur under the table,

355
00:19:21,924 --> 00:19:24,624
because your sleeve was smeared with alcohol.

356
00:19:24,624 --> 00:19:28,624
I see. That's why only the sleeve of her outfit caught fire.

357
00:19:28,624 --> 00:19:31,324
That's just an assumption!

358
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:35,924
Ms. Sakura, will you please explain what's going on?

359
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,224
Don't tell me that even you the police suspect me?

360
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:41,324
Besides, that ignition device or what

361
00:19:41,324 --> 00:19:43,924
that you're talking about was made of items found in the kitchen!

362
00:19:43,924 --> 00:19:46,024
So, it's natural you would find it at the scene of the crime, isn't it?

363
00:19:46,024 --> 00:19:48,824
Of course it's natural, because that's exactly

364
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:52,924
what you were going for when you made that crafty device.

365
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:55,024
This shop is scheduled to open tomorrow!

366
00:19:55,024 --> 00:19:57,824
Many people went in out including delivery people,

367
00:19:57,824 --> 00:20:00,024
and facility management personnel!

368
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:03,224
I'm sure that anyone of them would've been able to commit the crime, no?

369
00:20:03,224 --> 00:20:06,324
No, only you could've done it!

370
00:20:06,324 --> 00:20:07,424
Huh?

371
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:09,224
Ran, can you get me my cell phone

372
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:10,624
that is inside my pochette.

373
00:20:10,624 --> 00:20:13,424
-Okay. -Please show Mayuko the picture

374
00:20:13,424 --> 00:20:16,624
I took with my cell phone a while ago.

375
00:20:16,624 --> 00:20:19,624
The picture. Oh, this.

376
00:20:22,224 --> 00:20:24,324
Just before the show started,

377
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:27,224
Mr. Tsujimoto drank the water from the pot.

378
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:31,424
If the water was salt water, he would've naturally noticed.

379
00:20:31,424 --> 00:20:36,424
You're the only person who could've added salt to the pot after that!

380
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:45,924
I was nothing more than a tool to him.

381
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:47,424
The time has finally come

382
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:49,924
for our dream to come true.

383
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:53,924
Yeah, I'm standing at the pinnacle as a chocolatier of Japan,

384
00:20:53,924 --> 00:20:56,924
who has a shop in the first class district of Tokyo.

385
00:20:56,924 --> 00:21:01,124
I think it's about time that you think about our wedding too.

386
00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:04,124
Wedding?

387
00:21:04,124 --> 00:21:07,524
Don't tell me you're being manipulated by the media too?

388
00:21:08,824 --> 00:21:11,724
I'm really grateful for all you did.

389
00:21:11,724 --> 00:21:15,924
You dished out a lot of ideas so that I could achieve success.

390
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:19,224
You're a top-notch drawer.

391
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:21,124
A drawer?

392
00:21:21,124 --> 00:21:23,724
But, my dream's been realized.

393
00:21:23,724 --> 00:21:27,124
The best position, the best shop.

394
00:21:27,124 --> 00:21:29,324
I've gotten hold of everything.

395
00:21:29,324 --> 00:21:33,424
I don't need any old drawers anymore.

396
00:21:34,424 --> 00:21:35,924
Oh no.

397
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:39,224
You're to be disposed of along with the opening of the shop.

398
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:42,324
Thank you for everything till now.

399
00:21:46,524 --> 00:21:49,024
I loved him.

400
00:21:49,024 --> 00:21:52,724
I gave him my all and did everything I could do.

401
00:21:52,724 --> 00:21:55,024
And yet, he had the nerve to dispose of me

402
00:21:55,024 --> 00:21:58,824
as if disposing of something that he found no use for anymore.

403
00:21:58,824 --> 00:22:00,524
Ms. Mayuko.

404
00:22:00,524 --> 00:22:03,824
If I was going to lose him anyway, I wanted to burn everything off.

405
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:06,924
Him as well as the shop.

406
00:22:06,924 --> 00:22:10,824
My love too!

407
00:23:38,624 --> 00:23:42,824
Just as I thought, in the hands of "Deduction Queen Sonoko",

408
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:45,824
all cases are solved in a jiffy.

409
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:49,824
The chocolate of the crystallization of love that

410
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:53,024
I was going to eat with Makoto melted in a jiffy.

411
00:23:53,024 --> 00:23:57,224
Solving cases in too much of a jiffy is not good.

412
00:23:57,224 --> 00:24:00,324
All you did was sleep.

413
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:03,224
"Next Episode"

414
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:06,224
Three incidents using the same method?

415
00:24:06,224 --> 00:24:09,624
Entitled, "Red Oil-based Swoosh Case"?

416
00:24:09,624 --> 00:24:12,124
Somebody who has a grudge against the police.

417
00:24:13,124 --> 00:24:17,324
Doesn't that woman police officer look familiar?

418
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:19,124
Masked Buyer.

419
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,124
Officer Chiba's first love!

420
00:24:23,124 --> 00:24:24,524
That is...

421
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:27,624
Next Conan,

422
00:24:27,624 --> 00:24:31,824
"First Love Joint Investigation (Part 1)"

423
00:24:47,624 --> 00:24:49,824
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:51,724
"Air bag"

425
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:52,824
The next episode involves the love story

426
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,924
of the "you know who" police detective.

427
00:24:53,924 --> 00:24:55,724
Ran, how've you been doing with Shinichi since?

428
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:56,849
Nothing really.
