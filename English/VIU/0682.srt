1
00:00:02,055 --> 00:00:04,355
Officer Takagi went off

2
00:00:04,355 --> 00:00:07,555
"Meet with parents" -without telling anyone where he was going.

3
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:09,955
The following day, the members of the Youth Detective Squad

4
00:00:09,955 --> 00:00:13,655
were scheduled to meet Officer Takagi in front of the MPD.

5
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:16,555
However, Officer Takagi didn't show up.

6
00:00:16,555 --> 00:00:18,455
Then, a man approached.

7
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:22,555
Do you know Officer Wataru Takagi, children?

8
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:25,755
Yes, we do. But why?

9
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:27,755
I couldn't have asked for better.

10
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:32,855
He asked me to hand this over to his detective girlfriend.

11
00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:36,155
Could you do so for me?

12
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:40,455
Are you referring to Officer Sato whom we were just talking about?

13
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:43,455
Do you mean you also know that female detective?

14
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:44,455
Yes.

15
00:00:44,455 --> 00:00:47,355
I'm sure they're getting married soon!

16
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:50,255
-Right! -They're really in love, you see!

17
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:54,955
Then, please relay this message from him to the happy female detective.

18
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:59,855
He said that it's perishable, so open it as soon as you can.

19
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:01,855
He also said that it will be no good

20
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:04,555
by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

21
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:06,555
We opened the package

22
00:01:06,555 --> 00:01:09,455
and found a tablet computer inside it.

23
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:12,455
When we switched it on, the screen displayed...

24
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:16,955
Officer Takagi?

25
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:21,655
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

26
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:23,755
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

27
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:25,555
Officer Takagi cannot budge an inch.

28
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:27,455
He is exhausted and is in a pinch.

29
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,155
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,155
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:33,855
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:20,222
"A Life-Risking Love Broadcast (Crisis)"

33
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:23,622
Hey, how is he?

34
00:03:23,622 --> 00:03:25,422
Is Takagi okay?

35
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:26,422
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:30,122
Since three hours ago, he has been lying on his stomach.

37
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:33,822
But he looks very exhausted and weak.

38
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:38,222
Hasn't anyone reported to have found the police memo book

39
00:03:38,222 --> 00:03:40,422
that he dropped back then?

40
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:43,122
No. Not as of yet.

41
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:46,722
Did you manage to contact the bereaved family

42
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:48,422
of the three people who committed suicide

43
00:03:48,422 --> 00:03:50,322
that Takagi was looking through in the reference room last week?

44
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:51,822
Well...

45
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:53,722
For the first case, the parental home of the medical student,

46
00:03:53,722 --> 00:03:56,322
Ms. Yuko Tokugi was in Kochi.

47
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:58,422
However, it seems like they moved six months ago,

48
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:00,922
and we don't know their whereabouts yet.

49
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:03,922
As for the second one, Ms. Natalie Kuruma,

50
00:04:03,922 --> 00:04:05,622
she was born in Hokkaido.

51
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:07,822
Her only family, which were her parents,

52
00:04:07,822 --> 00:04:10,722
were on their way to picking up their daughter's body,

53
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:14,222
when both of them got involved in a traffic accident and passed away.

54
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:17,222
As for Ms. Kyoka Hikoue who worked as a hostess,

55
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:19,922
it seems she lied about where she was from,

56
00:04:19,922 --> 00:04:21,422
so her background is still unknown.

57
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:24,222
But according to stories from her fellow workers,

58
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,622
she seemed to speak with a Hakata dialect at times.

59
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:29,822
Shikoku, Hokkaido and Kyushu.

60
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:32,522
All those places are far enough that one would need to stay overnight.

61
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,422
If I remember correctly, all three suicides

62
00:04:34,422 --> 00:04:36,522
occurred on the same day, right?

63
00:04:36,522 --> 00:04:37,722
Yeah.

64
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:40,922
It'll be a year the day after tomorrow.

65
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:43,522
What's wrong?

66
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:45,822
The... The image suddenly started shaking.

67
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:47,022
What?

68
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:49,322
Is... Is this an earthquake?

69
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,822
Contact the meteorological agency

70
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:52,622
and confirm where the epicenter is.

71
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:55,822
If this is a live image, we can narrow down the location!

72
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:57,222
Yes, sir!

73
00:04:57,222 --> 00:05:00,222
It... It's shaking quite a bit.

74
00:05:00,222 --> 00:05:03,422
Hang on, Takagi!

75
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:05,722
Shiratori! Have you found nothing yet?

76
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,622
Well...

77
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:11,022
From yesterday up until now,

78
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:14,322
no earthquake has been detected in all 47 prefectures

79
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:15,622
throughout the nation.

80
00:05:15,622 --> 00:05:17,422
What?

81
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:19,322
Don't tell me...

82
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:21,922
Could he be abroad?

83
00:05:28,722 --> 00:05:32,122
The shaking seems to have stopped.

84
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:35,022
This... This is a crow.

85
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:36,822
What on earth does this mean?

86
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:40,822
It's likely that the stick or whatever the camera is fixed to

87
00:05:40,822 --> 00:05:45,722
was shaken because the crow perched on it.

88
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:47,822
I see.

89
00:05:47,822 --> 00:05:50,322
Anyway, it is highly probable that someone related to the suicide cases

90
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:56,022
did this because he bears some sort of grudge against Takagi!

91
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,622
Work with the district police station

92
00:05:57,622 --> 00:05:59,022
which has detailed information on the cases

93
00:05:59,022 --> 00:06:01,622
-and nail the suspect! -Yes, sir...

94
00:06:06,822 --> 00:06:09,422
I'm sorry to have kept all of you until so late today.

95
00:06:09,422 --> 00:06:11,422
I'm sure you're all tired from the interrogation, aren't you?

96
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:12,722
No.

97
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:15,022
By the way, aren't you worried?

98
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:17,922
Officer Takagi will get sleepy when nightfall comes, right?

99
00:06:17,922 --> 00:06:19,022
That's right.

100
00:06:19,022 --> 00:06:21,422
If he rolls over while he sleeps...

101
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:25,522
He'll be fine. He doesn't move much when he sleeps.

102
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:27,522
Have you slept with him before?

103
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:30,122
You really get along well, don't you?

104
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:32,722
You see. We take short naps together

105
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:35,122
when we're staking out.

106
00:06:35,122 --> 00:06:38,522
Maybe the culprit has a grudge against Officer Takagi

107
00:06:38,522 --> 00:06:41,122
because of one of the suicide cases.

108
00:06:41,122 --> 00:06:43,322
Maybe the case was actually a homicide,

109
00:06:43,322 --> 00:06:45,322
but Officer Takagi concluded it as suicide...

110
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,222
I don't think so.

111
00:06:48,222 --> 00:06:51,222
If that's the case, the culprit would have a grudge

112
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:53,022
against all the other police detectives who rushed to scene,

113
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:55,322
as well as the forensic officers.

114
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:57,122
Besides, it doesn't seem like anybody has requested

115
00:06:57,122 --> 00:07:00,322
for any of the three cases to be re-investigated.

116
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:01,622
I guess you're right.

117
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,522
All three suicides occurred the day

118
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:05,422
after Officer Date got into the accident.

119
00:07:05,422 --> 00:07:08,322
Since Officer Takagi was still dazed because of the incident,

120
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:09,922
the one who concluded that it was suicide

121
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:11,622
was me, the assistant inspector.

122
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:14,222
If anyone were to be hated, it would be me.

123
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:18,522
Maybe it's the lady who went to medical school?

124
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:22,022
Maybe she committed suicide because she ran over Officer Date?

125
00:07:22,022 --> 00:07:25,322
The person who ran over Officer Date was arrested on the spot.

126
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:27,022
Ms. Tokugi that you were referring to

127
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:28,422
was involved in a different accident.

128
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:30,422
How about the English conversation teacher?

129
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:33,422
Maybe she was dating Officer Takagi or something.

130
00:07:33,422 --> 00:07:35,222
No way.

131
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,522
Although the word "DATE" was written

132
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:40,522
all over the calendar in her room,

133
00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:44,122
there's no way that an officer could go on dates every day like that.

134
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:47,222
Then, maybe it's the hostess?

135
00:07:47,222 --> 00:07:49,122
She probably committed suicide

136
00:07:49,122 --> 00:07:51,222
because her boyfriend was arrested by that Officer Date, right?

137
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:54,022
Moreover, Officer Takagi was good friends with Officer Date.

138
00:07:54,022 --> 00:07:55,922
It's true that Officer Date

139
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:59,122
was the one who arrested Ms. Hikoue's boyfriend.

140
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:00,222
But it was a day after Officer Date passed away

141
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:01,922
when she found out through the newspapers

142
00:08:01,922 --> 00:08:04,322
that her boyfriend was a marriage swindler,

143
00:08:04,322 --> 00:08:06,722
and hung herself in despair.

144
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:09,922
There's no reason why the police should be hated for that.

145
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,922
Hey. I think it'd be better to ask around

146
00:08:12,922 --> 00:08:16,922
for more detail about that Officer Date.

147
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:18,422
Why?

148
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:20,222
Something is bothering me.

149
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:21,822
Especially the fact that Officer Date

150
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:25,822
has the same first name, "Wataru", as Officer Takagi.

151
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:37,622
It's night time already.

152
00:08:37,622 --> 00:08:40,522
It's so cold. I'm freezing.

153
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:43,122
I wonder if I'm going to die here.

154
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,422
Well, I'm to be blamed for all this.

155
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:48,122
So, I guess God's judgment was passed on me.

156
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:50,622
Takagi...

157
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:53,622
This...

158
00:08:55,422 --> 00:08:58,022
I'm leaving this to you...

159
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:05,422
Officer Date!

160
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:08,322
I... I'm counting on you.

161
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:12,322
No. Get a hold of yourself.

162
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:14,422
I've got to get out of here somehow

163
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:16,522
and relay the message to that person!

164
00:09:21,222 --> 00:09:23,122
For Officer Date's sake,

165
00:09:23,122 --> 00:09:24,922
I have to reveal the truth.

166
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:33,422
Bad news, superintendent!

167
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:35,822
I contacted the provider, and found out

168
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:38,622
that the image is being transmitted via a server abroad after all.

169
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:42,522
We're asking the local investigators to help us on this matter.

170
00:09:42,522 --> 00:09:44,622
Does it mean it's going to take some time?

171
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:46,822
Moreover, even if we do figure it out,

172
00:09:46,822 --> 00:09:49,322
if the transmission is being sent via several countries...

173
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,622
More time will be needed for an investigation.

174
00:09:51,622 --> 00:09:55,522
And by the time we find out, Takagi could have frozen to death.

175
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:57,122
How is Takagi doing?

176
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:59,022
He seems very weak.

177
00:09:59,022 --> 00:10:00,922
He has been trying to get up

178
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:02,322
and was moving his body all night.

179
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:04,622
I understand how cold he must be,

180
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:06,822
but he'll tire himself out that way!

181
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:20,222
"Police Station" -It wasn't a date?

182
00:10:20,222 --> 00:10:21,822
Did Officer Takagi really say so

183
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,622
two days ago before he left?

184
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:25,622
Yes.

185
00:10:25,622 --> 00:10:27,222
Yumi teased him by asking

186
00:10:27,222 --> 00:10:30,122
if he was going on an overnight date at a hot spring.

187
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:32,022
But he answered with a slightly scary face,

188
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:34,822
"It's not a date".

189
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:39,922
By the way, you mentioned on the phone

190
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:41,322
that you noticed something.

191
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:44,822
The way the man who handed us the tablet talked

192
00:10:44,822 --> 00:10:46,722
was a bit strange.

193
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:48,622
He said, "It will be no good

194
00:10:48,622 --> 00:10:51,922
by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow".

195
00:10:51,922 --> 00:10:53,622
It sure sounds strange.

196
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:55,722
"Tomorrow, or at the latest, the day after tomorrow."

197
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,222
That's how it's normally said.

198
00:10:57,222 --> 00:11:00,522
Maybe he's a foreigner who speaks Japanese well.

199
00:11:00,522 --> 00:11:03,422
But he looked just like a Japanese, didn't he?

200
00:11:03,422 --> 00:11:05,522
Yeah.

201
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:06,922
Well...

202
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:09,222
Was there anyone who's related to Hokkaido

203
00:11:09,222 --> 00:11:12,022
among the three women who committed suicide?

204
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:13,222
Yes.

205
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:15,622
The English conversation teacher, Ms. Natalie Kuruma

206
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:18,122
was from Hokkaido.

207
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:20,622
Then, maybe someone close to her

208
00:11:20,622 --> 00:11:23,322
is the one who kidnapped Officer Takagi.

209
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:25,622
-What? -Why is that so?

210
00:11:25,622 --> 00:11:27,022
In the Hokkaido dialect, "the day after tomorrow"

211
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:31,522
is said as "tomorrow or the day after tomorrow".

212
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:33,322
But why?

213
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:36,722
The teacher was probably Officer Date's girlfriend.

214
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:38,922
Girlfriend? Officer Date's?

215
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:42,422
The word that was written on the calendar every day

216
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:44,022
was not the English word "date".

217
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:47,222
The word "date" is spelt D-A-T-E.

218
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:50,022
But when it's read as a Romaji, it's pronounced as "Da-Te".

219
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:52,322
It was probably a marker showing

220
00:11:52,322 --> 00:11:54,022
when Officer Date would go and spend the night.

221
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:57,622
So, just like Officer Takagi said, he didn't go on a date.

222
00:11:57,622 --> 00:11:59,122
I see.

223
00:11:59,122 --> 00:12:00,522
Since she was an English teacher,

224
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:04,422
I assumed that the "DATE" written there

225
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:06,222
meant the English word "date".

226
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:08,522
Also, you mentioned that she had a date scheduled

227
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:11,822
on the day she committed suicide, right?

228
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:13,722
-Yes. -If she had planned

229
00:12:13,722 --> 00:12:17,922
to go out somewhere with Officer Date that day...

230
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,422
she probably would've kept waiting without knowing

231
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:24,422
that Officer Date got into a traffic accident.

232
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:26,322
And she might have ended her own life out of despair,

233
00:12:26,322 --> 00:12:29,322
thinking that he dumped her.

234
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:30,922
No way.

235
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:34,922
A year later, Officer Takagi probably finally realised what happened,

236
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:38,722
and wanted to tell her bereaved family about it.

237
00:12:38,722 --> 00:12:40,422
Come to think of it,

238
00:12:40,422 --> 00:12:42,422
Officer Takagi seems to have been in tears

239
00:12:42,422 --> 00:12:44,822
while looking at the photo in the memo book.

240
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:47,722
It's very likely that he just confirmed the photo was of Ms. Natalie's

241
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:52,122
after he went through the papers last week.

242
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:54,122
But wait!

243
00:12:54,122 --> 00:12:56,822
This is about Officer Date, isn't it?

244
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:59,222
It has nothing to do with Takagi, right?

245
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:00,522
What if she had told her parents

246
00:13:00,522 --> 00:13:04,222
that Officer Date's name was not Date,

247
00:13:04,222 --> 00:13:05,722
but rather, "Wataru",

248
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:08,722
because it would be mistaken as "date"?

249
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,222
If Officer Takagi had contacted Ms. Natalie's family

250
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,722
saying that he had something to report about her,

251
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:16,622
and that he would like to meet them, what would happen then?

252
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:18,722
They could've mistakenly thought that the Officer Wataru from the MPD

253
00:13:18,722 --> 00:13:21,222
who dumped their daughter and drove her into suicide

254
00:13:21,222 --> 00:13:24,822
had the nerve to appear to meet them a year later.

255
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:28,222
That's why they did what they did to Officer Takagi.

256
00:13:28,222 --> 00:13:30,522
But Ms. Natalie's parents

257
00:13:30,522 --> 00:13:33,822
got into a traffic accident on their way to pick up her body.

258
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:36,522
Then, who picked up her body?

259
00:13:36,522 --> 00:13:37,722
If I remember correctly,

260
00:13:37,722 --> 00:13:40,722
it was a middle-aged man who was also an English teacher.

261
00:13:40,722 --> 00:13:43,722
He took her belongings with him, too.

262
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,722
That reminds me, we just got a report from the district police station

263
00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:49,222
saying that when that teacher came to get the body,

264
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:51,422
he broke down in tears.

265
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:53,022
They also come from the same hometown

266
00:13:53,022 --> 00:13:54,122
and he treats her like his daughter.

267
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:56,322
Then there's no doubt about it.

268
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:59,222
He is the one who kidnapped Officer Takagi.

269
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:01,922
He probably found the text mail among Natalie's belongings

270
00:14:01,922 --> 00:14:04,022
and misunderstood that Officer Takagi had dumped her,

271
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:06,069
and made her commit suicide!

272
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:08,392
We've pinned down the suspect.

273
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:10,892
His name is Ryusaku Fuemoto.

274
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:14,592
He quit his job as an English conversation teacher due to an illness

275
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:17,992
and is thought to have left for his hometown in Hokkaido last month.

276
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:20,692
His residence in Hokkaido is unknown,

277
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:24,992
but considering that he hasn't moved from the flat he used to live in,

278
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:27,692
it is highly likely that he's hiding there.

279
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:29,092
Go there on the double,

280
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:31,292
and take him into custody as soon as you find him.

281
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:33,192
Make him spit out Takagi's location!

282
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:34,492
Yes, sir...

283
00:14:50,592 --> 00:14:52,492
"Fuemoto"

284
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:57,692
Please come in. The door's open.

285
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:05,892
Finally.

286
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:09,292
You've finally found me.

287
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:12,892
While waiting for you, I was about to doze off

288
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:15,992
and accidentally push the switch of the bomb.

289
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:19,192
How about it? Is he the man?

290
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:20,492
Yeah!

291
00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:23,192
-There's no mistake! -He's the man!

292
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:25,792
Okay, now talk.

293
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,392
Tell us where Officer Takagi is.

294
00:15:28,392 --> 00:15:31,292
Are you the one?

295
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:36,392
The officer who is the superior of Officer Wataru Takagi?

296
00:15:36,392 --> 00:15:37,792
I see.

297
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:41,892
Just like he said, you're quite a beauty.

298
00:15:41,892 --> 00:15:46,592
But it doesn't mean he's right for dumping Natalie...

299
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:52,392
Now, listen well before I knock you over!

300
00:15:52,392 --> 00:15:54,992
The man you kidnapped is Wataru Takagi,

301
00:15:54,992 --> 00:15:57,392
and Natalie's boyfriend was Wataru Date!

302
00:15:57,392 --> 00:16:00,292
Besides, she wasn't dumped!

303
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,492
But in a mail that she sent out, she said

304
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:04,192
that Wataru wouldn't come anymore!

305
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:05,892
Of course, he wouldn't!

306
00:16:05,892 --> 00:16:07,792
It was because he was run over by a car

307
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:09,192
and passed away that day!

308
00:16:09,192 --> 00:16:11,292
That... That can't be!

309
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:14,392
So, hurry up and tell us where Officer Takagi is.

310
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:20,992
Don't tell me...

311
00:16:20,992 --> 00:16:22,892
Don't tell me that there was poison in the wine?

312
00:16:22,892 --> 00:16:24,692
Call an ambulance! Hurry!

313
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,092
-Yes, madam! -Hang on!

314
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:28,592
He is...

315
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:30,392
Where? Where is he?

316
00:16:30,392 --> 00:16:32,492
-Hurry up and tell me! -He...

317
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:39,592
Where is he?

318
00:16:43,592 --> 00:16:45,792
Hey, Sato! What's going on?

319
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:48,992
Please report the situation! Did you take custody of the suspect?

320
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:51,392
What's the matter? Say something, Sato!

321
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:53,692
-Sato? -Superintendent.

322
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:55,292
I'm sorry to say

323
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:57,192
that the death of suspect,

324
00:16:57,192 --> 00:17:00,492
Ryusaku Fuemoto was confirmed a while ago.

325
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:02,592
It seems that the wine Fuemoto was drinking

326
00:17:02,592 --> 00:17:06,592
when we raided the place was laced with poison.

327
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,392
The suspect has passed away?

328
00:17:08,392 --> 00:17:10,392
Did someone poison him?

329
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:12,692
No, a bottle of poison was found

330
00:17:12,692 --> 00:17:14,992
near the wine bottle.

331
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,792
It seems that he was determined to kill himself

332
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:20,492
when the police arrived to start with.

333
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:23,092
Judging from the fact that he had a bomb on him,

334
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:25,692
he probably planned to blow himself to death

335
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:26,892
if he was taken by force.

336
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:28,592
But if he was to be given a chance to talk,

337
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:32,592
he would drink the poison and see us grieve.

338
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:35,592
The suspect seemed to have held a grudge against the police.

339
00:17:35,592 --> 00:17:38,392
Did you tell him that he had it all wrong?

340
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,492
Yes, sir.

341
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,692
I told him that Officer Wataru Takagi whom he kidnapped,

342
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:43,692
was an officer at the MPD where Officer Wataru Date also worked at,

343
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:45,592
and that he had mistaken the two.

344
00:17:45,592 --> 00:17:48,392
And the motive of why he thought Natalie had committed suicide

345
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:50,292
was not because Date had dumped her,

346
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:53,392
but was because Date had died in a traffic accident.

347
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:55,492
But by the time I explained it to him,

348
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,192
he had already drunk the poison,

349
00:17:57,192 --> 00:18:01,092
and I wasn't able to find out where Takagi is being confined.

350
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:05,092
Have you found any clue from the suspect's room?

351
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:06,292
No.

352
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:08,992
We're investigating right now, but nothing yet.

353
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:10,492
The only thing we've found

354
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:12,692
was Officer Takagi's cell phone which must've been taken by the culprit

355
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,592
when he was kidnapped.

356
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:18,192
There are several text mails from the suspect in his mailbox,

357
00:18:18,192 --> 00:18:19,692
and among them, there's one saying

358
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:23,392
that the suspect had planned to come and see Officer Takagi in person.

359
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:26,392
However, he fell ill, so he felt very apologetic.

360
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:29,192
But he wanted Takagi to go to his place

361
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:32,892
with the airline ticket that he had bought for himself.

362
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:34,692
I also found a text mail addressed to me,

363
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:37,292
which I think was written by the suspect.

364
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:39,092
It says, "I left your gift from Officer Takagi

365
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:43,392
in the bushes in front of the MPD".

366
00:18:43,392 --> 00:18:48,292
So I think he intended to hand me the tablet that way.

367
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:49,692
But since he coincidentally ran into

368
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:51,692
the children who knew Takagi,

369
00:18:51,692 --> 00:18:53,892
he decided to ask them to deliver the tablet instead.

370
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:56,792
Yes. That way, he didn't have to risk

371
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:58,892
anyone stealing it while it was left there.

372
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:00,092
Are there any other mails

373
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:03,792
that could serve as clues on where Takagi may be?

374
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:06,492
No. All it says is they'd meet up

375
00:19:06,492 --> 00:19:07,492
when Takagi got to the airport.

376
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:10,692
Then, continue investigating the residence.

377
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,192
Roger!

378
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,192
It's most likely that nothing will be found.

379
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:16,292
Yeah.

380
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:17,792
All the culprit has done

381
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:20,392
is giving us a tablet which we can only use

382
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,392
to view the image of Takagi who has been kidnapped.

383
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:25,292
Almost all its functions have been disabled,

384
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:28,192
and everything written on the back has been scratched off.

385
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:31,892
The image is transmitted by a server abroad

386
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:33,592
and its source hasn't been identified yet.

387
00:19:33,592 --> 00:19:37,192
If he had planned to commit suicide in front of the police to begin with,

388
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:39,692
I don't think he would leave anything behind

389
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:41,792
that would give away Takagi's location.

390
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:44,392
If anything, it would most likely be the suspect's hometown,

391
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,992
which was Hokkaido, but...

392
00:19:45,992 --> 00:19:48,592
Well, I also asked the local construction site workers

393
00:19:48,592 --> 00:19:50,992
to check the buildings, just to be safe.

394
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:54,892
But as of now, we haven't received any report of Takagi being seen

395
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:58,092
in a four-storey building as seen in the image.

396
00:19:59,592 --> 00:20:03,192
The only clue we have left is the image of Takagi.

397
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:05,492
If it either rains or snows,

398
00:20:05,492 --> 00:20:07,492
perhaps we could narrow down the location.

399
00:20:07,492 --> 00:20:10,192
The only thing that showed up in the image was a crow.

400
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:12,292
A crow showed up in the image?

401
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:13,292
Yeah.

402
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:17,092
If you have the recording, could you show it to us, too?

403
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,492
When it comes to animals,

404
00:20:18,492 --> 00:20:20,592
I think children know more about them.

405
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:21,792
-Yeah! -Yeah!

406
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,192
It's just a plain crow, isn't it?

407
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:29,492
That's right.

408
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:33,292
But look, its neck is grey, see?

409
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:35,992
This is a Western jackdaw!

410
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:38,492
But if I remember correctly, this type of crow...

411
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:39,792
I'm back!

412
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:42,092
So? Did you find out anything?

413
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:43,492
No.

414
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,192
It seems all the data in his computer has already been deleted.

415
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:49,192
I'm having them search where the bomb was attained,

416
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:50,392
but nothing has been found yet.

417
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:52,092
I see.

418
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:53,992
So, how is Officer Takagi doing?

419
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:56,392
Don't worry. He's still alive.

420
00:20:56,392 --> 00:20:58,992
Although he looks quite weak.

421
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,892
-Nice! -What... What's going on?

422
00:21:02,892 --> 00:21:05,592
Officer Takagi's been moving all the while since yesterday.

423
00:21:05,592 --> 00:21:08,292
I thought he was moving about because he was cold.

424
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:10,492
But actually, he was trying to cut the rope at his feet

425
00:21:10,492 --> 00:21:12,292
using the corner edge of the board.

426
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:14,392
He finally succeeded in doing so!

427
00:21:14,392 --> 00:21:15,492
I see.

428
00:21:15,492 --> 00:21:17,892
If he hangs his legs out towards both sides,

429
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:19,592
it'll keep him from falling off easily.

430
00:21:19,592 --> 00:21:21,092
He did it...

431
00:21:22,992 --> 00:21:25,892
But what's this? What is he doing with his leg?

432
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:28,992
He seems to be pulling the sheet covering the board towards him.

433
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:30,092
If he covers himself with it,

434
00:21:30,092 --> 00:21:32,792
he could stop his body temperature from dropping too low.

435
00:21:36,992 --> 00:21:39,292
No! He dropped it.

436
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:40,692
Why?

437
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:46,592
Maybe he wants someone to notice the sound of the sheet falling?

438
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:50,492
Officer Takagi, what are you trying to do?

439
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:54,192
Somebody...

440
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:55,992
Please notice that.

441
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,192
That's...

442
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,392
Wait a second! What is that?

443
00:23:26,892 --> 00:23:28,392
That's...

444
00:23:28,392 --> 00:23:30,992
Wait a second! What is that?

445
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:35,292
-A bomb? -What?

446
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:59,392
If the timer had been set to explode at that time...

447
00:23:59,392 --> 00:24:02,192
I wonder if the shaky image was checked?

448
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,092
The sun pillar phenomenon.

449
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:06,092
Where are you, Officer Takagi?

450
00:24:06,092 --> 00:24:07,392
Don't tell me...

451
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:10,192
If I remember correctly, the estimated time of death

452
00:24:10,192 --> 00:24:12,392
was around 10.00 am.

453
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:13,792
Mr. Date...

454
00:24:14,992 --> 00:24:16,392
Sato!

455
00:24:16,392 --> 00:24:18,692
Takagi!

456
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:24,392
