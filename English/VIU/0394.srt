1
00:00:04,281 --> 00:00:05,980
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,981 --> 00:00:07,780
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:11,080
The Youth Detective Squad goes through great adventure

4
00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:13,080
at an eccentric mansion of tricks. Off we go after the treasure!

5
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:14,580
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,480
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:16,481 --> 00:00:18,681
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:03,007
Mountains are for men.

9
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:15,807
Genta, come on and get to work.

10
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:20,106
Please help us collect firewood!

11
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,206
Huh? I'm not slacking off!

12
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:24,306
I already have a lot.

13
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:25,307
Look.

14
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:29,707
That's far from enough, Genta!

15
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:33,006
I see.

16
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:35,207
But why isn't Conan here?

17
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:38,107
Not again.

18
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:41,207
Like I told you just a while ago.

19
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:50,506
Did you catch a cold?

20
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:51,707
No.

21
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:54,606
Shinichi.

22
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,007
What were we talking about?

23
00:02:58,507 --> 00:03:00,606
I shouldn't have asked him.

24
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:02,106
A song? The "Seven Baby Crows".

25
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:04,006
The "Seven Baby Crows", right?

26
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:05,107
Yes, I know the song.

27
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:12,206
"Crow, oh crow, why do you cry..."

28
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:13,806
That's the song, right?

29
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:16,006
Yes, that's the one.

30
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:19,207
I used to sing it a lot on my way home from school.

31
00:03:20,307 --> 00:03:21,307
And? What about it?

32
00:03:21,308 --> 00:03:22,906
Is it your music homework or something?

33
00:03:22,907 --> 00:03:25,006
No!

34
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:27,706
Remember the number I mentioned the other day?

35
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,406
When I use my cell phone and hit the buttons rhythmically,

36
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:32,806
it sounds like the beginning part of that song, right?

37
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:34,406
0858.

38
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:36,406
"Crow, oh crow..."

39
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:38,807
Let me see.

40
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:47,406
True.

41
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:49,707
It finally came back to me.

42
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:55,006
Back then, when Bellmot was sending mail to the boss,

43
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:59,506
I felt somewhat sad and nostalgic.

44
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,306
But it wasn't the expression on her face that made me feel that way.

45
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,506
It was the sound of the buttons she was pushing.

46
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:08,806
What? Then are you saying that the mail address of their boss

47
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:10,107
is the "Seven Baby Crows"?

48
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:16,806
It can't be.

49
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:19,806
Why would the boss use a children's song for his mail address?

50
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:24,406
What if they remembered the address by the melody?

51
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:26,406
By the melody?

52
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:27,506
Yes.

53
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:32,406
Then they wouldn't have to register the mail address inside their phone.

54
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:34,506
Which makes it safe for a variety of reasons, right?

55
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:40,307
0858 may sound like "Crow, oh crow", but...

56
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:45,807
"Why do you cry" is not so easy.

57
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:50,506
Well, it's true that it's not all that accurate,

58
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:53,407
but if we make do with the slight difference in sound...

59
00:04:54,707 --> 00:04:56,107
and put it together.

60
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,306
It comes out like this.

61
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:04,507
This is the mail address of the boss of the Black Organization.

62
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,207
What?

63
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,606
I quite sure it is.

64
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:15,306
Hey, don't tell me you sent mail there?

65
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:19,706
Why would I do something so stupid as to let them know where we are?

66
00:05:19,707 --> 00:05:20,906
I guess so.

67
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:22,507
You scared me out of my wits.

68
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:25,406
Well, if I'm going to send mail out,

69
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:28,206
it'll be after I tell Officer Takagi of the circumstances.

70
00:05:28,207 --> 00:05:29,607
They'll annihilate him.

71
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:32,806
Officer Takagi.

72
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:35,706
At the point that he tries to specify who the boss is,

73
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:38,206
they'll kill him with their very hands.

74
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:41,806
Then, their target will turn to the one who provided the mail address,

75
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:43,506
that is you, Kudo.

76
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:46,206
Not only Officer Takagi,

77
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:47,406
but the police should also be notified

78
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:48,806
after we explain the situation to them.

79
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,506
We should face the organization prepared.

80
00:05:51,507 --> 00:05:52,806
Impossible.

81
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:55,306
If right after that incident, maybe,

82
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:59,106
but now that it's been closed as a mere kidnap case.

83
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:01,706
Aside from Officer Takagi who might believe a story like that,

84
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:05,106
it's unthinkable that anyone else will.

85
00:06:05,107 --> 00:06:07,806
Yes. In order to get the police to make a move,

86
00:06:07,807 --> 00:06:12,706
we needed that mail address at that time.

87
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:17,506
I mean somebody unthinkable may emerge after all, you know.

88
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,706
Someone unthinkable?

89
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:21,006
Don't tell me...

90
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:23,006
You know who it is?

91
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:28,006
Don't tell me you know their mail address or who the boss is?

92
00:06:28,007 --> 00:06:30,007
I wonder?

93
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:34,606
But what a waste that we can't do a thing about it,

94
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:40,006
despite having found the boss' mail address.

95
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:42,706
Well, it's best you give up

96
00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:43,907
and forget about it.

97
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:49,707
You should never open that mail address.

98
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:53,407
It's Pandora's Box.

99
00:06:56,907 --> 00:07:02,607
"Adventure at an Eccentric Mansion - Lock In."

100
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:05,707
What did you just say?

101
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,106
What's this? What's this about a panda's box?

102
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:10,806
Tell us, Conan.

103
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:12,706
Treasure?

104
00:07:12,707 --> 00:07:16,406
Don't tell me there's a panda inside?

105
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:18,906
No, Ayumi.

106
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:22,706
It is a story in Greek mythology,

107
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:24,806
in which God gives a box filled with evils and disasters that exist,

108
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:27,706
to a woman called Pandora,

109
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:30,706
and tells her never to open it.

110
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:33,006
But the more somebody tells you not to open something,

111
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:35,806
the more it makes you want to open it, right?

112
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:37,706
Come on, Genta.

113
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,806
Right.

114
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:42,006
Pandora went against God's words and opened the box,

115
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:46,006
which brought about evil and disaster into this world.

116
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,506
That's how the story went, right?

117
00:07:47,507 --> 00:07:49,006
Yes.

118
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:51,906
And what about that panda's box?

119
00:07:51,907 --> 00:07:52,907
-Right, right! -Right, right!

120
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,207
It's nothing.

121
00:07:58,307 --> 00:08:00,606
Talking about box, while we were picking up firewood,

122
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:03,306
we found a strange looking stone box.

123
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:04,406
Yes!

124
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:06,706
A stone box?

125
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:08,406
What is that?

126
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:13,606
Yes. A stone that looks like an old box with a hole in two places.

127
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:17,407
When we looked inside through the hole, it was full of words.

128
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:23,106
Something about a God's stone this and that was what written inside.

129
00:08:23,107 --> 00:08:25,006
There were many difficult kanji characters written inside.

130
00:08:25,007 --> 00:08:27,506
-So we couldn't read it. -Exactly.

131
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,706
Hey.

132
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:31,707
Will you take me to where you found that stone box?

133
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:34,207
Yes.

134
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:41,607
This way. This way. It's this way.

135
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:48,206
This way. This way.

136
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:50,106
It's this way.

137
00:08:50,107 --> 00:08:52,606
You don't need to run.

138
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:54,506
Hey!

139
00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:56,307
That's right.

140
00:08:57,707 --> 00:09:02,407
How far did you guys go pick up firewood anyway?

141
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:06,006
See, over there.

142
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:07,007
Right!

143
00:09:17,107 --> 00:09:20,906
I didn't know there was such a mansion in a place like this.

144
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:23,006
After taking another good look at it...

145
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:24,907
It sure is beat up.

146
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:28,206
Oh, my.

147
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:31,707
This is really a dilapidated building.

148
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:41,606
It kind of looks creepy.

149
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:43,906
You can say that again.

150
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:48,507
It seems to have been left unused for quite a number of years.

151
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:55,507
This place is...

152
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:59,706
Conan!

153
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:01,607
Over here! This way!

154
00:10:16,307 --> 00:10:20,306
This is the stone box that you've been wanting to see, Conan.

155
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:26,107
We were looking into this swamp and found this box sunk at the bottom...

156
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:30,606
and a carp was lost inside it!

157
00:10:30,607 --> 00:10:35,006
We tried to catch the carp and pulled the box up,

158
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:37,606
and noticed the words inside it.

159
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:40,507
The carp got away though.

160
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,906
Isn't this a stone garden lantern?

161
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:48,407
What? Stone garden lantern?

162
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:52,706
The kind you see a lot in Japanese gardens.

163
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:56,207
A lantern made of stone, you know.

164
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:02,607
This is probably the fire pouch in the middle where you place the candle.

165
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:06,906
Now that you mentioned it, it does look that way.

166
00:11:06,907 --> 00:11:08,006
But if it is really so,

167
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:11,207
the covering and the base should also be on the ground somewhere.

168
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:15,306
It is on the ground.

169
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,006
Inside the swamp.

170
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:19,807
And it's not like just one or two.

171
00:11:23,607 --> 00:11:24,806
True!

172
00:11:24,807 --> 00:11:28,107
We were so absorbed in the carp a while ago that we didn't notice it.

173
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:32,906
They probably sank all the stone garden lanterns they had in the yard

174
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:35,606
into the swamp.

175
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:37,106
To make it look as if

176
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:39,707
there were no stone garden lanterns here...

177
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:43,607
to begin with.

178
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,706
They didn't want anyone other than themselves

179
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:53,206
to decipher the code that they found

180
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:55,907
and take away the treasure.

181
00:11:57,607 --> 00:12:00,207
Treasure...

182
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:04,206
Are you serious?

183
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:07,007
Yes, most likely.

184
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:17,706
No, that's not all.

185
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:19,706
It seems that the stone garden lanterns

186
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:22,007
were not only sunk into the swamp to hide the code.

187
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:25,507
What do you mean?

188
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:40,107
It seems it was done to hide a crime, too!

189
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:31,860
The temperature of this swamp is approximately 20 degrees centigrade.

190
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:37,060
Despite this, decay gas is not accumulated in the body yet.

191
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:40,761
Which means it hasn't been too long since the victim's been killed.

192
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:47,160
From the traces of strangulation left on the neck,

193
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:50,360
he was probably choked to death then sunk into the swamp.

194
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:51,860
The stone garden lanterns were probably stacked up one on top the other

195
00:13:51,861 --> 00:13:54,861
so that his body wouldn't come floating up.

196
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:58,260
Who could've done this?

197
00:13:58,261 --> 00:13:59,660
Beats me.

198
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:03,560
I'm sure it has something to do with treasure though.

199
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:07,161
Mr. Teruhisa Tamai, age 42.

200
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:11,660
How about it? Anything?

201
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:12,760
No.

202
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:16,361
It's just a driver's license, nothing else.

203
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:20,560
There's something's inside.

204
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:22,261
Hey. Is that the treasure?

205
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:25,660
No.

206
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:28,260
This is...

207
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:31,060
a comma-shaped bead made of stone.

208
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:33,061
The word fire is carved on it.

209
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:37,760
Don't tell me that that's the treasure?

210
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:41,160
What's this? It's just a strangely shaped stone.

211
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:42,360
Hey!

212
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:44,360
A person is dead here.

213
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:47,260
How can you go on and on talking about treasure?

214
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,960
Doc, will you call the police?

215
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:53,061
Oh, that's right.

216
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:06,661
I guess I can't call from here.

217
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:10,360
The cell phone won't connect from here

218
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:13,660
so I'll go back to the tent and call from there.

219
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:14,960
Thanks!

220
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:16,960
Be careful.

221
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:19,660
So since the sun is starting to set,

222
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:21,461
let's all head back to the tent, too.

223
00:15:22,861 --> 00:15:25,760
Hey, Conan. You mean we're leaving just like that?

224
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:30,360
Exactly! The treasure is right before our eyes, you know?

225
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:32,660
-That's right! -Yes!

226
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:33,661
Idiot!

227
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:35,760
The one who killed this man

228
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:38,560
could still be hiding somewhere around here yet.

229
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:41,660
You guys! Do you want to be attacked wandering around here or what?

230
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:43,061
But...

231
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:47,660
Listen.

232
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:50,560
And besides, we only found out what this man's name is,

233
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:53,160
we don't know anything else, you know?

234
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,061
He seems to be a treasure hunter.

235
00:15:56,661 --> 00:16:01,660
His notebook is filled with information and maps of treasures

236
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:02,961
that are scattered all over Japan.

237
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:07,460
-Really? -Yes.

238
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:12,261
The process of his treasure hunt this time is written in detail, too.

239
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:17,660
"I've been able to team up with a partner that's pretty good.

240
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:22,860
So now I can outfox that petty thief that puts on airs."

241
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:24,461
Petty thief that puts on airs?

242
00:16:31,661 --> 00:16:36,661
"I've been burned by that magician, time and again."

243
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:52,560
The resting place of the God Nioh is near the sun,

244
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:56,860
in an extremely busy location where the elders get together.

245
00:16:56,861 --> 00:16:59,660
That is where the God Nioh stone is.

246
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:03,160
Those who do not fear the rage of the God Nioh,

247
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:07,360
get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand

248
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:10,660
and learn from the proverb of long ago.

249
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:13,160
Kichiemon Samizu.

250
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:15,260
Samizu?

251
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:17,560
Kichiemon Samizu.

252
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:21,260
is the one who lived during the closing years of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

253
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:24,660
He's the puppet maker who financially supported

254
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:26,660
the samurai who backed up the Shogun.

255
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:29,460
What a fantastic puppet!

256
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:36,260
This puppet brings you tea, right?

257
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:38,161
That's not all.

258
00:17:39,161 --> 00:17:41,360
When you finish drinking tea,

259
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,760
it takes the tea cup back to where it came from, too.

260
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:47,560
I bet a remote controller or something is used!

261
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:50,460
No, it doesn't need that.

262
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:52,360
It moves on its own.

263
00:17:52,361 --> 00:17:56,361
Then how does it run, Ayumi?

264
00:17:57,461 --> 00:17:59,660
I really don't know, but...

265
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:03,260
They say the inside consist only of springs and gears.

266
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:06,160
There are various other dolls,

267
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:09,561
and there seem to be dolls that remain even now, made by word-of-mouth.

268
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:12,760
You sure are smart.

269
00:18:12,761 --> 00:18:16,660
I saw a program about it on TV just the other day.

270
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:20,260
At any rate, the dolls made by Kichiemon

271
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:24,460
were reputed and favoured among the merchants as looking to be alive.

272
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:26,160
Therefore, he made a fortune in a single generation.

273
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:29,060
People called him "Puppet Maker Kichiemon".

274
00:18:29,061 --> 00:18:33,660
Does that mean the doll of the God of Strength made by Kichiemon

275
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:36,761
is somewhere in this house?

276
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:40,461
Doll of the God of Strength?

277
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:51,160
No. Even if it were to be here, 140 years have passed.

278
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:54,060
Hidden in a dilapidated place like this,

279
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:56,360
I'm sure it would be all had it by now.

280
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:59,761
Oh, so it's all beat up.

281
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:04,261
The treasure is the stone of the God.

282
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:10,660
The resting place of the God Nioh is near the sun,

283
00:19:10,661 --> 00:19:15,660
in an extremely busy location where the elders get together.

284
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:18,360
That is where the God Nioh stone is.

285
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:20,460
And that's what's written.

286
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:22,960
So what does that mean?

287
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:27,461
Right. What is the meaning of the letters that are carved on that stone?

288
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:31,160
It's too difficult and hard to understand.

289
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:33,160
To make it simple,

290
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:35,160
it says that the stone of the God Nioh can be found

291
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:40,460
in a place nearest to the sun where the God Nioh sleep.

292
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:43,260
That is a very busy place where the elders get together.

293
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:45,760
What is that stone of the God Nioh?

294
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:49,760
It's not just any other stone, is it?

295
00:19:49,761 --> 00:19:55,860
The God of Strength owns a very hard stone.

296
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,860
A very hard stone...

297
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:01,660
In other words,

298
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:03,660
the King of Stones.

299
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,061
A diamond.

300
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:08,261
Diamond...

301
00:20:10,661 --> 00:20:14,160
Yes, diamonds are said to have been brought into Japan

302
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:17,060
at the period towards the end of the Shogunate government,

303
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:18,961
so the time is just about right.

304
00:20:22,161 --> 00:20:24,860
Come to think of it, during that TV program,

305
00:20:24,861 --> 00:20:29,460
it said that they found an odd map in Kichiemon's storeroom.

306
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:33,360
The man probably saw the map on a recent TV program,

307
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:35,360
searched for this mansion,

308
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:38,260
and found the stone lanterns here.

309
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:42,060
And the partner that he believed in

310
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:44,060
and thought would be useful ended up killing him.

311
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:47,260
That's most likely what happened.

312
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:48,560
Wait.

313
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:52,061
There's something more written here.

314
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,360
What comes after that is the problem.

315
00:20:56,361 --> 00:21:04,360
Those who do not fear the rage of the God Nioh.

316
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:06,760
It's there after all.

317
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:11,061
And get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand.

318
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:16,361
Their hands brimming with stones?

319
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:20,060
Hey, Conan.

320
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:22,860
What is it? Tell us what follows.

321
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:27,860
Their hands brimming with...

322
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:29,461
The Big Jewel!

323
00:21:33,761 --> 00:21:36,060
No doubt about it.

324
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,460
Hey, hey.

325
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:41,061
Let's leave Conan behind and go look for the treasure ourselves.

326
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:45,060
I guess so.

327
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:47,460
Let's go look for the treasure ourselves.

328
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:53,160
What? But without Conan we can't decipher the code.

329
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:55,460
Don't worry.

330
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:58,961
I think the key to the ignition has already been turned.

331
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:07,360
This is interesting.

332
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:09,160
A mansion of tricks.

333
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,861
Great.

334
00:23:59,861 --> 00:24:04,560
"Next Episode."

335
00:24:04,561 --> 00:24:06,261
Skulls!

336
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:16,761
No! That's a trap!

337
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:21,561
Hey!

338
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:29,861
Next Conan, "Adventure at an Eccentric Mansion - Tricks".

339
00:24:45,661 --> 00:24:47,760
Next Conan's Hint:

340
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:50,060
"Three types of sacred treasures."

341
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:52,060
Next week, he'll be appearing after a long time!

342
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:53,160
-Who's he? -Who's that?

343
00:24:53,161 --> 00:24:54,461
His rival.
