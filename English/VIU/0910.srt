1
00:00:00,648 --> 00:00:04,647
The Youth Detective Squad, accompanied by Ms. Wakasa,

2
00:00:04,648 --> 00:00:07,947
arrived at a newly opened campground,

3
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:10,747
There we met Shiraami University basketball team.

4
00:00:10,748 --> 00:00:12,247
Midori Furuoka.

5
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:14,047
Sumito Ashizawa.

6
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:15,747
Fumiaki Urushibara.

7
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:18,448
Kuninori Danno.

8
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:22,047
That night, while eating curry for dinner

9
00:00:22,048 --> 00:00:24,448
with the members of the basketball team...

10
00:00:25,848 --> 00:00:27,447
Do you smell something burning?

11
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:28,448
What?

12
00:00:29,448 --> 00:00:31,547
You're right.

13
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:33,348
Hey, look.

14
00:00:34,948 --> 00:00:37,547
The tent's on fire!

15
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:39,847
Isn't that Urushibara's tent?

16
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:41,847
-No way. -Seriously?

17
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:44,247
Water! Everyone get water!

18
00:00:44,248 --> 00:00:45,947
Hurry!

19
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:47,547
After finally putting out the fire,

20
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,247
we visited the neighboring tent to ask

21
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:51,348
about the circumstances under which the fire started...

22
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:57,947
Chief Kuroda?

23
00:00:57,948 --> 00:00:59,247
Sorry.

24
00:00:59,248 --> 00:01:02,148
I was sleeping with earplugs in.

25
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:07,247
But I can tell at a glance what's happening.

26
00:01:07,248 --> 00:01:10,947
Let's call the police immediately.

27
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:12,648
Any objections?

28
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:16,748
Rumi Wakasa?

29
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:20,947
Ms. Wakasa...

30
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,748
Ms. Wakasa!

31
00:01:26,248 --> 00:01:27,847
This woman...

32
00:01:27,848 --> 00:01:30,347
Her right eye's blind.

33
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:35,147
Also, if you look closely at the hardened candles,

34
00:01:35,148 --> 00:01:39,247
there's one with a hole near the tip,

35
00:01:39,248 --> 00:01:42,447
and for some reason there's a V shaped burn

36
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:45,847
on the cover of the magazine next to the laptop.

37
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:49,747
Maybe someone set some kind of mechanism.

38
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:51,147
I see.

39
00:01:51,148 --> 00:01:52,547
You're right.

40
00:01:52,548 --> 00:01:58,148
Which means that person is one of you three...

41
00:02:00,048 --> 00:02:03,747
who visited his tent one at a time.

42
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,747
Oh, my.

43
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:07,447
Earlier, you said you were sleeping

44
00:02:07,448 --> 00:02:11,347
inside your tent with earplugs in.

45
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:14,647
No. Actually, while nodding off,

46
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:19,047
I was watching through a gap in my tent flap

47
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:22,547
as you cheerfully ate your curry.

48
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:27,447
Since my tent was right next to the tent that burned,

49
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:32,247
I remembered the faces and order of the people who came this way.

50
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:35,147
But since I had earplugs in,

51
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:41,447
I don't know what the three of them discussed with the victim.

52
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:45,647
Surely, you didn't ignore the tent engulfed in flames

53
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:52,248
so you could observe the person you're so interested in, right?

54
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:54,547
No.

55
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:57,647
I made the mistake of falling asleep.

56
00:02:57,648 --> 00:03:03,547
So why don't we ask you one by one again?

57
00:03:03,548 --> 00:03:09,648
What did you discuss with the victim then?

58
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:13,547
When the countdown reaches zero,

59
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:16,048
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

60
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:20,347
Both Kuroda and Wakasa are suspicious!

61
00:03:20,348 --> 00:03:22,447
In any case, let's get to the bottom of the fire!

62
00:03:22,448 --> 00:03:23,947
He sees through the one and only truth.

63
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:25,747
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

64
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,848
His name is Detective Conan.

65
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,710
"Mystery of the Burning Tent (Part 2)"

66
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:15,491
By the time I visited Urushibara's tent,

67
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:18,291
he was already hammered.

68
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,991
"Midori Furuoka (22)" -No matter what I said,

69
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:23,391
he just shouted, "Shut up, go away" at me.

70
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:25,491
We didn't have a proper conversation.

71
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:29,191
Were the lights inside the tent off then?

72
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:32,591
Yes. It was still light out,

73
00:05:32,592 --> 00:05:35,591
and he said he was going to read comics before going to sleep.

74
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:40,591
But why'd he have so many candles inside his tent?

75
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:44,891
No matter how you look at it, that's way too many.

76
00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:50,591
It was his job to bring matches and candles.

77
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:53,091
-I see. -In that case...

78
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:57,391
was it also Urushibara's job to bring all those comic books?

79
00:05:57,392 --> 00:05:59,391
Those are mine.

80
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,891
Urushibara said he wanted to read them while camping.

81
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:06,691
But if I'd known this would happen,

82
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:10,491
I would've dragged him out of his tent.

83
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:11,991
I should've made him eat curry with us

84
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:14,492
instead of reading comics.

85
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,591
When I visited the tent,

86
00:06:21,592 --> 00:06:25,591
he didn't respond no matter how many times I called out to him.

87
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:29,291
"Sumito Ashizawa (22)" -At first, I thought he was ignoring me,

88
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,191
but after hearing Furuoka's story,

89
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:34,391
I thought he must've gotten drunk and fallen asleep.

90
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:37,691
He never wakes up once he passes out from drinking.

91
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:38,991
It's so bad,

92
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:42,491
people would draw things on his face during training camps.

93
00:06:42,492 --> 00:06:45,491
Were the lights on inside the tent then?

94
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:48,691
I don't think so.

95
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:51,791
But after I left his tent,

96
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:53,891
the lights suddenly came on.

97
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:57,791
He was doing squats inside his tent.

98
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,091
Squats?

99
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:04,191
Yes. He said he always did squats before going to bed.

100
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:06,891
We saw that, too!

101
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:10,191
He had his hands behind his head, like this.

102
00:07:10,192 --> 00:07:12,791
He was repeatedly doing bending exercises.

103
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:15,191
We saw his shadow on the tent wall.

104
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:17,791
-I see. -If that's true,

105
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:21,291
then that would mean the victim was still awake then.

106
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:22,691
Yes.

107
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:27,091
Which means the last person to visit the victim's tent...

108
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:28,092
"Kuninori Danno (22)" -Hold on!

109
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:31,391
I didn't set Urushibara's tent on fire!

110
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:33,491
When I went to his tent to lure him out

111
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:34,891
with the smell of curry,

112
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:38,791
he didn't say anything, just like when Ashizawa visited.

113
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,991
I tried to talk to him,

114
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:42,991
but he just silently did his squats.

115
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:44,891
I thought he was doing them while using headphones

116
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:46,892
to listen to music or something.

117
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:51,891
Now that I think about it, maybe he did hear me.

118
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:56,391
It was like he was telling me to go away.

119
00:07:56,392 --> 00:08:00,591
His squatting movements got more and more intense.

120
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:03,991
His movements got more and more intense?

121
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:07,591
Why did the victim Urushibara stay in his tent

122
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:11,291
instead of eating curry with everyone else?

123
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:13,791
We got into an argument.

124
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:16,291
He and I had a complicated relationship.

125
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:17,691
Complicated how?

126
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:21,091
Well, during basketball practice, his elbow...

127
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:22,491
Hey.

128
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:25,591
Danno claimed he used to be the ace of the basketball team.

129
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:28,291
-Is that true? -Yes, he was.

130
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:31,391
He received a lot of attention from professional teams

131
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:33,892
for being able to dunk at his height.

132
00:08:35,392 --> 00:08:37,691
-But... -If not for the injury

133
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:41,591
he suffered to his right eye at Urushibara's hands,

134
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:45,491
he may have ended up playing for a foreign team.

135
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:49,291
But ironically, thanks to that injury,

136
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:52,291
I was promoted from sub to starter.

137
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:54,891
Now I'm the ace.

138
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:56,791
And since Danno quit playing,

139
00:08:56,792 --> 00:09:00,591
he started spending more time with our manager, Furuoka,

140
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:04,091
and now they're dating.

141
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:05,591
Yes.

142
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:09,591
Danno was always surrounded by groupies,

143
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:11,391
but the moment he became a manager,

144
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:14,292
every last one of them left.

145
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:17,691
Inspector Yuminaga.

146
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:20,791
What is it? Did you figure something out?

147
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:23,391
It's about the tape

148
00:09:23,392 --> 00:09:26,992
on the victim's fingers you asked about.

149
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:30,891
The surface was burned,

150
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:33,491
but most of the adhesive side survived,

151
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:35,591
so we removed it.

152
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:38,591
We didn't find any trick or mechanism.

153
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:39,991
I see.

154
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:42,091
Hey, Inspector Yuminaga.

155
00:09:42,092 --> 00:09:44,592
Could I see that photo?

156
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:47,991
Yes, sure.

157
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:49,591
Thanks.

158
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:51,291
I knew it.

159
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:53,091
That person...

160
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,991
Hey, kid.

161
00:09:54,992 --> 00:09:57,391
Did you notice something again?

162
00:09:57,392 --> 00:09:58,691
But...

163
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:00,692
I could be confused.

164
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:04,292
Confused?

165
00:10:06,692 --> 00:10:08,392
Hey, guys!

166
00:10:10,992 --> 00:10:15,291
They've completely forgotten about the case.

167
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:16,591
I did it!

168
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:18,491
Gosh.

169
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,691
What are you guys doing?

170
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:24,591
Hey, Conan. Ms. Wakasa just showed us.

171
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:27,191
So we've been making it together.

172
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:28,891
Look.

173
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:30,992
A balancing acorn.

174
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:38,091
That's it. This is it!

175
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:40,991
This is what the culprit used

176
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:43,791
to deceive our eyes

177
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:47,492
and naturally set fire to the tent.

178
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:53,091
Give us a break, detective.

179
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:56,991
We're not the ones who set fire to Urushibara's tent.

180
00:10:56,992 --> 00:10:59,491
We did visit his tent one at a time

181
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,091
before it caught fire,

182
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:05,091
but he didn't answer any of us.

183
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:07,991
We know Urushibara was inside

184
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:10,491
since we saw his shadow doing squats on the tent wall,

185
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:12,291
but we couldn't have set the tent on fire

186
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:14,491
from the inside unless we'd gone inside.

187
00:11:14,492 --> 00:11:16,991
And the zipper on the tent entrance

188
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:21,091
was zipped all the way down and locked, right?

189
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:24,891
Doesn't that make the tent a locked room?

190
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,591
Urushibara was pretty drunk.

191
00:11:27,592 --> 00:11:31,191
Maybe he got drunk while doing squats

192
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:34,491
and kicked the lantern over?

193
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:37,191
But what if those candles

194
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:40,391
could be used to create an automatic ignition device?

195
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:42,991
-Automatic ignition device? -Automatic ignition device?

196
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:43,992
That's absurd.

197
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:45,791
I think he would've noticed immediately

198
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:48,091
if there were something like that.

199
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:50,791
After all, he was doing squats.

200
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:52,891
By that time, Urushibara was probably

201
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:55,591
already drunk and asleep.

202
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:56,592
What?

203
00:11:56,593 --> 00:11:59,891
If you think I'm lying, I'll show you

204
00:11:59,892 --> 00:12:03,091
how to make a sleeping man do squats,

205
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:07,792
and set his tent on fire.

206
00:12:15,795 --> 00:12:18,394
First,

207
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:21,794
stick a bamboo skewer into the end of a candle.

208
00:12:21,795 --> 00:12:25,195
Then drip wax from another candle onto it.

209
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,594
And stick two candles together.

210
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:32,994
Sandwich the skewer between them so they make a straight line.

211
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:36,894
Next, since we poked holes in the tops of candles

212
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:39,994
set on top of the books,

213
00:12:39,995 --> 00:12:43,995
if you stick both ends of the skewer into the holes...

214
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:48,195
See? Your candle seesaw is complete.

215
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:54,694
Now set fire to both ends of the stuck together candles.

216
00:12:54,695 --> 00:12:58,494
The side that burns faster will become lighter and rise.

217
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,494
The side that falls will be exposed to a lot of flame,

218
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:03,294
making it drip more wax.

219
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:06,195
Now this end becomes lighter and rises.

220
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:09,194
When you repeat that process...

221
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:11,494
-Amazing. -How interesting.

222
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:15,194
It seesaws back and forth like the balancing acorns.

223
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:21,694
Yes. If you use books to block the flame on one side,

224
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:25,194
only one flame can be seen rising and falling.

225
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:28,194
Take a look behind you.

226
00:13:28,195 --> 00:13:31,594
Our shadows on the tent are rising and falling, too.

227
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:33,994
You're right. They're growing and shrinking.

228
00:13:33,995 --> 00:13:36,194
That's amazing.

229
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:41,194
I see. By linking the victim's hands behind his head,

230
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:45,194
sitting him in the legless chair,

231
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:49,294
and placing a large bag against the tent to cover his lower body,

232
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,994
they used the rising and falling flame

233
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:54,994
to make his shadow look like he was doing squats.

234
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:56,294
In other words,

235
00:13:56,295 --> 00:14:00,494
the strange V shaped burn on the magazine was created

236
00:14:00,495 --> 00:14:03,694
because it was placed on top of the laptop

237
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:07,094
in order to block the light from one end of the candle,

238
00:14:07,095 --> 00:14:09,094
and only the inside was exposed to the flame

239
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:12,594
when it first caught fire.

240
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:17,094
Then what about all the candles that melted together?

241
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:19,594
The culprit probably scattered them

242
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:21,294
next to the contraption beforehand,

243
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:23,794
in order to conceal their trick.

244
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:25,594
I see.

245
00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:27,494
Finally, by knocking the laptop over with water

246
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:30,194
while putting out the flames,

247
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:33,694
they were able to reduce all evidence of their trick to ashes.

248
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:37,494
But that candle's just moving up and down.

249
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:40,594
That wouldn't set fire to anything.

250
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:42,294
It does.

251
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:43,594
As time goes on,

252
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:47,094
the movements of the contraption become more intense.

253
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,295
If you set some flammable clothes on the floor...

254
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:53,995
It caught fire.

255
00:15:00,295 --> 00:15:02,494
It's dangerous, so don't do this at home.

256
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:04,094
Okay...

257
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:08,994
Which means this trick...

258
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:13,794
Midori Furuoka who claimed the light was out so the victim could sleep

259
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:16,394
when she visited his tent.

260
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:19,694
Kuninori Danno, who visited the tent after the victim started doing squats,

261
00:15:19,695 --> 00:15:22,294
couldn't have set it up.

262
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:25,494
Which means the man claiming the lights were out

263
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:27,494
when he visited the tent,

264
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:29,694
but looking back after he left,

265
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:34,294
saw that the victim had turned on the lights and begun doing squats.

266
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:36,294
Sumito Ashizawa.

267
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:39,094
You're the only one.

268
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:40,194
Seriously?

269
00:15:40,195 --> 00:15:42,394
Is it true, Ashizawa?

270
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:44,094
No.

271
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:50,894
Urushibara's tent was zipped all the way shut and locked, right?

272
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:53,494
How could I have gotten inside?

273
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,795
The mud on your right elbow.

274
00:15:57,595 --> 00:15:59,295
When did that get there?

275
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:03,394
This is...

276
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:08,194
Most likely it happened while the victim was passed out,

277
00:16:08,195 --> 00:16:12,294
you made a cut in the tent with a sharp object,

278
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:14,994
and touched the ground with your right elbow

279
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:19,494
while forcing your way in.

280
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:20,794
I see.

281
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:22,094
Once the tent burned,

282
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:25,194
the cut would disappear along with it.

283
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:29,094
No, this mud got on me when I tripped earlier.

284
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:32,695
Then why did you remove the tape from your right hand?

285
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:37,594
This guy had tape on his right hand, right?

286
00:16:37,595 --> 00:16:40,594
Yes, on his pointer finger.

287
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:43,094
We saw it when he was holding the curry ladle.

288
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:46,094
I believe Urushibara had some on his right pointer

289
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:49,094
and middle fingers, too.

290
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:51,894
What about Urushibara's left hand?

291
00:16:51,895 --> 00:16:53,194
Well...

292
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:55,795
He didn't have any tape on his left hand.

293
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,494
But Urushibara's charred corpse

294
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:07,895
had tape on both hands, which means...

295
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:15,194
The culprit removed their own tape and put it on him

296
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:19,894
in order to keep the passed out Urushibara's hands

297
00:17:19,895 --> 00:17:23,395
linked behind his head.

298
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:28,294
If that's true,

299
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:31,694
then we might find on the adhesive surface of the tape

300
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:34,394
on the body's left hand

301
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:38,395
bits of your skin and hair that contain your DNA.

302
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:44,494
If you haven't thrown away the knife you used to cut the tent,

303
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:48,495
the fibers from the victim's tent should be on that, too.

304
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:53,194
Yes.

305
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:55,695
I've still got it.

306
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:00,494
Stay back!

307
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:02,794
Come any closer, and I'll stab her!

308
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:04,395
Ayumi!

309
00:18:06,595 --> 00:18:07,994
That's right.

310
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:12,194
I'm the one who set fire to Urushibara's tent!

311
00:18:12,195 --> 00:18:13,794
But why?

312
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:16,794
You had no reason to resent Urushibara!

313
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,694
No.

314
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:21,294
But he had dirt on me.

315
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:23,494
-Dirt? -Yes.

316
00:18:23,495 --> 00:18:27,994
I'm the one who asked Urushibara

317
00:18:27,995 --> 00:18:31,994
to hurt Danno so I could play.

318
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:33,194
What?

319
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:38,494
I wasn't expecting it to be a career-ending injury,

320
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:41,194
but he was constantly threatening me.

321
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:43,294
When I went to his tent today,

322
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:46,694
he drunkenly slurred,

323
00:18:46,695 --> 00:18:49,194
"If you don't want me to spill the beans,

324
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:53,594
you'd better make lots of money for me once you go pro."

325
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:56,494
Since he stopped responding,

326
00:18:56,495 --> 00:19:00,094
I entered his tent and set up that trick.

327
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:02,594
Fortunately, everything I needed for it

328
00:19:02,595 --> 00:19:05,895
was inside his tent.

329
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:09,494
But it's over now.

330
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:11,794
There's a cliff through the woods.

331
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:13,894
I don't want to die alone,

332
00:19:13,895 --> 00:19:17,895
so let's jump together, kid.

333
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:27,094
-Ayumi! -Hang in there, Ayumi!

334
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:30,494
Hurry up and use your tranquilizer watch and soccer ball.

335
00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:32,795
They're both inside our tent.

336
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:39,795
Hey, you...

337
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:43,194
Stay back!

338
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:46,094
Let go of my student.

339
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:48,394
I told you to stay back!

340
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,094
I'll say it again.

341
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:52,895
Let go of my student.

342
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,395
If you refuse...

343
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:01,695
Stab her.

344
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:06,094
Go on. Stab her.

345
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:10,094
Just like you used that box cutter to slice the tent.

346
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:11,694
Do it.

347
00:20:11,695 --> 00:20:14,694
Or should I...

348
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:17,095
help you?

349
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:34,294
Yoshida! Wake up, Yoshida!

350
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:35,894
Are you all right, Yoshida?

351
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:37,594
Can you hear me? It's your teacher!

352
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:39,395
Yoshida!

353
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:44,395
Ms. Wakasa.

354
00:20:45,395 --> 00:20:47,094
I was so scared!

355
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:48,895
Ms. Wakasa!

356
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:53,894
Thank you, Ms. Wakasa,

357
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:56,194
for distracting the suspect.

358
00:20:56,195 --> 00:21:00,394
If we let a child get stabbed before our eyes,

359
00:21:00,395 --> 00:21:03,894
the chief and I would've been worse than fired.

360
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,394
No problem.

361
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:10,394
I couldn't hear what you said to distract him, though.

362
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,595
Really?

363
00:22:53,295 --> 00:22:55,494
Hey. Did you see that, Haibara?

364
00:22:55,495 --> 00:22:56,794
See what?

365
00:22:56,795 --> 00:23:01,494
The suspect's face just before he was arrested by Chief Kuroda.

366
00:23:01,495 --> 00:23:05,094
Yes, it was pretty contorted.

367
00:23:05,095 --> 00:23:07,794
Maybe he was overcome by the spirit of a teacher

368
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:09,594
looking out for her student.

369
00:23:09,595 --> 00:23:12,994
Have you not noticed her right eye?

370
00:23:12,995 --> 00:23:17,294
Just so you know, I like Ms. Wakasa.

371
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,694
Don't say anything disparaging about her.

372
00:23:19,695 --> 00:23:21,095
What?

373
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:34,094
There's dirt on her pocket.

374
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:35,995
I can see a shape.

375
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:40,395
What is that?

376
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:45,094
"Next episode" -I'm sure you haven't forgotten, Mouri,

377
00:23:45,095 --> 00:23:46,794
about how much trouble you caused me

378
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:50,094
when you worked under me in investigations.

379
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,294
Inspector.

380
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:56,094
That's why I'm asking for your help.

381
00:23:56,095 --> 00:24:00,394
Ryuji Maehama was threatening Hide Tenyama in Sasago-cho.

382
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:04,094
At this rate, we're going to have to drop the charges,

383
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:06,295
even though we know he's the culprit.

384
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:12,595
