1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:01,539
A showdown.

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,639
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:06,939
The life of a person and a picture disappeared from a locked room.

4
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,039
Could this be the work of that guy who puts on airs, too?

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,439
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,939
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,939
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:57,895
Kogoro Mouri?

9
00:01:57,895 --> 00:01:58,895
Yes.

10
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:03,195
Why did you call that famous detective here?

11
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:04,695
Of course.

12
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:06,795
Father, the thief is after it.

13
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:09,495
After it? After what?

14
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:10,895
Naturally,

15
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:14,395
it's my new painting that the world of art has been waiting to see.

16
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:17,995
My painting, which is to follow "Red Lotus", "Gold", and "Pure White",

17
00:02:17,995 --> 00:02:19,195
and "Blue Storm" here.

18
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:24,895
And in order to get a hold of this,

19
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:28,795
he will fly here and appear from the darkness,

20
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:32,295
the so-called magician under the moon, the great and well-known,

21
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:34,495
Thief Kid.

22
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:35,595
What?

23
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:37,595
The notice arrived this morning.

24
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:40,995
"Tomorrow at 20:00, under the light of the full moon,

25
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,995
I shall appear to get the 'Blue Storm' painting."

26
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:45,095
This is a warning of theft.

27
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:47,695
Oh, no. We've got to do something.

28
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:50,595
Of course, I've already contacted the police.

29
00:02:50,595 --> 00:02:54,995
But he's an elusive, kaleidoscopic and unflawed magician.

30
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:57,095
I don't know if we'll succeed in protecting the painting.

31
00:02:57,095 --> 00:03:01,395
No, that's not what I'm worried about.

32
00:03:01,395 --> 00:03:04,195
With all this fuss, what if someone finds out about it?

33
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:07,495
No one will find out.

34
00:03:07,495 --> 00:03:09,095
Forever.

35
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:13,395
Don't tell me that you, Takeyori...

36
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:16,895
Yes, I couldn't think of a better way to work things out.

37
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:18,595
Don't do it, Takeyori.

38
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:21,095
Stop whatever you're trying to do.

39
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:24,595
Do you have any right to say something like that?

40
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:27,995
This is all happening because of you, father.

41
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:33,495
If you insist, I've got something on my mind, too.

42
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:38,095
I'm only kidding.

43
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:40,595
I was just trying to put on a mean act.

44
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:44,195
After all, I'm a world famous artist.

45
00:03:44,195 --> 00:03:46,595
I would never do something like that.

46
00:03:46,595 --> 00:03:48,995
Then, is the notice was a joke as well?

47
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,695
No, this was indeed delivered here.

48
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:53,095
But no need to worry.

49
00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:55,595
Thief Kid always never get to steal whatever he's after

50
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:58,095
if Detective Mouri is around.

51
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:03,295
See, thanks to the work of the little boy that is with him.

52
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:05,995
I'm sure he'll protect the painting for us this time, too.

53
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,195
That boy called Conan Edogawa.

54
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:16,495
"Thief Kid and the Four Masterpieces (Part 1)"

55
00:04:19,395 --> 00:04:21,395
How about it, Conan?

56
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,895
This will be your third confrontation with Thief Kid.

57
00:04:23,895 --> 00:04:25,495
Do you think you can outdo him?

58
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:27,095
I wonder?

59
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:30,695
I can't tell unless I actually confront him, but I don't think I'll lose.

60
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:31,995
It's not my third time either.

61
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:36,495
So you've confronted him more times than is written in the papers?

62
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:38,895
What's the secret to outdoing Thief Kid?

63
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:40,495
It's not that I always outdid him.

64
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:41,695
Of course, it's all due

65
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:45,595
to the daily training sessions taught by me, Kogoro Mouri.

66
00:04:45,595 --> 00:04:47,395
Hey, you're that famous detective!

67
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:48,995
Then he sure is tried and tested!

68
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:51,195
So, famed detective,

69
00:04:51,195 --> 00:04:52,695
what is your prospect of victory?

70
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:55,195
Victory over that greatest thief under the heavens?

71
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,595
There's no such thing.

72
00:04:57,595 --> 00:05:00,895
I can make him taste bitterness, though.

73
00:05:00,895 --> 00:05:02,195
He'll suffer!

74
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:03,895
Victory and bitterness?

75
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:05,495
Well, well.

76
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:08,595
Hey, what did you come here for? To joke around?

77
00:05:08,595 --> 00:05:10,095
Inspector Nakamori.

78
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:12,695
This is the place Thief Kid warned he would appear.

79
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:15,995
You go on ahead with Megure and investigate the murder!

80
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:18,095
I hate to say this, Inspector Nakamori,

81
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:21,095
but I came to this villa

82
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:25,195
because Mr. Oikawa received a warning from Thief Kid.

83
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:27,895
Inspector, are the police fully prepared?

84
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:31,395
Why is Thief Kid, who only goes after jewellery, is now after a painting?

85
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:33,295
There's a rumour claiming that the notice itself was a hoax.

86
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:34,495
What do you think?

87
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:36,395
No comment!

88
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:40,295
Press people, let me warn you again to stay away from the site!

89
00:05:40,295 --> 00:05:42,695
But the new painting by Mr. Oikawa called "Blue Storm"

90
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:46,795
is scheduled to be aired publicly on TV soon.

91
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:47,795
Isn't that right?

92
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:48,795
Yeah.

93
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,695
The painting is already completed.

94
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:53,095
And he's going to sign it on air.

95
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:56,595
That is if the painting is not stolen by Thief Kid.

96
00:05:56,595 --> 00:06:00,495
What? You're talking like it's already been stolen, aren't you?

97
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:01,695
Not really...

98
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,595
Anyway, Thief Kid warned that he'd appear at 20:00 tonight.

99
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:06,495
Until then and until the painting is confirmed to be safe,

100
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:08,595
don't ever go inside!

101
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:09,895
Do you understand?

102
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:13,695
I've been waiting for you, Mr. Mouri.

103
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:16,295
I'm Takeyori Oikawa.

104
00:06:16,295 --> 00:06:17,695
Hello.

105
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:19,595
But was it really all right

106
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:21,595
for me to bring my daughter and this boy along?

107
00:06:21,595 --> 00:06:23,895
Well, if you'd rather not have us here,

108
00:06:23,895 --> 00:06:26,895
Conan and I will wait in the car outside.

109
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:29,095
We have no problem on having you guys here.

110
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:31,395
I trust Detective Mouri.

111
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:32,695
Thank you very much.

112
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:37,695
And besides, this boy here seems to know that thief well.

113
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:39,795
Let me start by showing you around then.

114
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:41,895
First, I'll take you to the atelier where the "Blue Storm" is.

115
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:43,395
Come this way please.

116
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:44,695
Takeyori.

117
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,495
Could I have a word with you?

118
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:50,095
I'm sorry. But can it wait till later, father?

119
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:53,295
Is he your father?

120
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:55,495
Yes, he is my father-in-law,

121
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:58,495
as well as my teacher, Haruhito Kanbara.

122
00:06:58,495 --> 00:07:01,595
Would it sound better if I pronounced his name as "Seijin"?

123
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,995
Oh, the famous landscape painter.

124
00:07:03,995 --> 00:07:06,995
But ever since he hurt his hand 10 years ago,

125
00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:09,095
he hasn't held the paint brush.

126
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,895
Please come this way, here's the room.

127
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:19,495
It's a nice atelier.

128
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:21,495
Just as would be expected of Okutama,

129
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:23,795
there is nothing but mountains outside.

130
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:29,095
There are five members from the Riot Task Force below the window.

131
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:31,995
It's difficult to break in from here.

132
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:34,395
He can also use a hand glider,

133
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:37,595
but all the windows seem to be locked.

134
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:39,795
Could this be the painting in question?

135
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:41,695
Yes, it's the "Blue Storm".

136
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,595
I'd like to take a quick peek at it.

137
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:44,995
No, Mr. Mouri.

138
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:50,395
I don't like people seeing my work before its completion.

139
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:52,995
But all there's left to do is for you to sign it, right?

140
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:55,995
No, I'd like to still do touch ups here and there.

141
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:57,495
I see.

142
00:07:57,495 --> 00:07:59,895
But with a plaster bust here,

143
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:01,995
it sort of looks like the art room at school.

144
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:05,595
I have art class once a week here.

145
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:09,795
Is that a surveillance camera?

146
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:11,995
Yes. It was put there immediately

147
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:14,195
after we received the warning from Thief Kid.

148
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:17,995
Would you like to take a look at the images in it?

149
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:19,395
Let's go to the first floor, then.

150
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:27,095
There are two doors and there are two guards watching each door.

151
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:30,195
Moreover, they all have pinch marks on their cheeks.

152
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:32,995
I guess that means Inspector Nakamori has already checked them out.

153
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:37,395
Listen! It's only 30 minutes to 20:00, the time of the warning.

154
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:40,295
All of you, stay fully alert and guard the place!

155
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:42,995
Oh, so this is the image of that...

156
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:45,995
It definitely has a clear view of the painting in question,

157
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:47,495
but why's there only one camera?

158
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:50,295
I also heard that there was a surveillance camera here,

159
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:52,395
but I didn't think there would only be one.

160
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:55,395
I'm sorry if I didn't seem to get the correct message across.

161
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:59,395
Why aren't you letting the guards into the atelier?

162
00:08:59,395 --> 00:09:01,595
I won't allow anyone in there.

163
00:09:01,595 --> 00:09:04,395
It's possible they could peek at my painting like Mr. Mouri almost did.

164
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:07,195
None of my men would do anything like that.

165
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:10,195
Well, having one camera is better than nothing though.

166
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:11,895
That's right.

167
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:15,395
Could I have you turn that camera off for a little while?

168
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:16,395
Huh?

169
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:18,995
I want to check my painting, so for just about 10 minutes.

170
00:09:18,995 --> 00:09:23,095
But it's less than 30 minutes to the time of the warning.

171
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,195
Please let me borrow this transceiver.

172
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:27,495
I'll contact you as soon as I finish checking it.

173
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:33,795
Roger.

174
00:09:33,795 --> 00:09:35,895
Please go ahead inside.

175
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:38,295
-Thank you. -Takeyori.

176
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:39,595
Father.

177
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,195
Could I have a word with you now?

178
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:44,795
I'm going to do a final check on my painting.

179
00:09:44,795 --> 00:09:47,495
I already told you that I have something in mind too, didn't I?

180
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:48,895
I'll be done right away.

181
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:50,695
So let's talk later.

182
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:52,995
Would you wait here a while for me?

183
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,895
He's late. He's too late.

184
00:09:57,895 --> 00:10:00,895
What is he doing? It's been more than 10 minutes since he went in.

185
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:03,195
I've finished checking, Inspector.

186
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:04,995
You may turn on the surveillance camera.

187
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,995
-Okay, turn it on. -Yes, sir.

188
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:09,595
How is it? Is it working?

189
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:13,095
Yes. Please hurry out of that room.

190
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:14,095
Yes, sir.

191
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:19,495
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, father.

192
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:24,695
I would like to see the famed painting that Thief Kid is after.

193
00:10:24,695 --> 00:10:26,995
I heard it's a masterpiece of a set of four paintings.

194
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:28,595
A set of four paintings?

195
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,795
The first piece is "Red Lotus", a flower.

196
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:32,895
The second one is "Gold", that stands for moon.

197
00:10:32,895 --> 00:10:34,995
The third, "Pure White" stands for a bird.

198
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:37,495
And the fourth, the one that Thief Kid is after is "Blue Storm"

199
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:39,395
and it stands for wind.

200
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:41,895
I see. Flowers, birds, wind and the moon.

201
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:46,295
I see. He's trying to express the beauty of nature with his four paintings.

202
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:49,595
I can sort of understand flower, the moon and the wind.

203
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,495
But how come "Pure White" stands for bird?

204
00:10:51,495 --> 00:10:52,895
It's a crane bird.

205
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:58,095
It's a painting of a red-crested white crane standing in the snow.

206
00:10:58,095 --> 00:11:01,895
A rich person auctioned his previous three paintings for a high price,

207
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,995
and it seems the same person is waiting for this fourth one, too.

208
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:06,995
-A blackout! -The breaker!

209
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:08,595
Somebody go check the breaker!

210
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:10,495
I'll go to the atelier upstairs!

211
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:13,195
-Close off all the entrances and exits! -Yes, sir.

212
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:14,495
Don't tell me it's Thief Kid?

213
00:11:14,495 --> 00:11:17,495
There's still more than 10 minutes before the time of the warning.

214
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:19,895
Father, are you all right?

215
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:21,195
What is it? What's up?

216
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:22,895
Please answer me!

217
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:25,695
It blacked out and the old man is still in there.

218
00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:27,495
How did he get inside the room?

219
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:30,295
He came in when I was leaving the room.

220
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:32,595
He came in saying that he can't trust the police or the detective,

221
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:34,795
so he's going to guard the painting himself.

222
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,095
Since he's a stubborn man,

223
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,295
I figured its better that I ask you, Inspector,

224
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:40,295
to persuade him to lock the door and was about to go call you

225
00:11:40,295 --> 00:11:42,095
when the lights suddenly went out.

226
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:43,495
And where's the key?

227
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,295
I was in a rush to open the door and dropped it some place.

228
00:11:46,295 --> 00:11:47,295
Darn it!

229
00:11:47,295 --> 00:11:48,795
Let's break the door down.

230
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,195
-One, two... -One, two...

231
00:11:51,995 --> 00:11:52,995
What the...

232
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:56,195
Shoots!

233
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:57,495
He escaped from the window!

234
00:11:57,495 --> 00:11:58,895
What's the situation outside?

235
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:02,495
Well, a lot of paint brushes and brush stands came falling.

236
00:12:02,495 --> 00:12:04,895
There was no one in sight at all.

237
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:06,695
Look! The painting's gone!

238
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:12,395
Right. It disappeared as if it were an illusion.

239
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:13,995
Father.

240
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:15,295
Get a hold of yourself.

241
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:16,395
Father!

242
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:19,795
Together with the old man's dead body

243
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:21,595
covered with blood as bright red as a lotus flower.

244
00:12:21,595 --> 00:12:23,095
Father!

245
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:30,302
Thief Kid committed murder?

246
00:12:30,302 --> 00:12:33,302
But Thief Kid doesn't kill, does he?

247
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:34,502
I'm not sure.

248
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:36,602
If Thief Kid did commit murder,

249
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:39,102
it's going to take a while to report, won't it?

250
00:12:39,102 --> 00:12:41,402
Yes. If worse comes to worst, it may take more than a day.

251
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:43,002
Hey, you over there!

252
00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:44,002
If you're free,

253
00:12:44,002 --> 00:12:47,102
would you please go get me a drink from the broadcast van?

254
00:12:47,102 --> 00:12:48,902
Yes, sure.

255
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,102
Got it.

256
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:53,902
Here he is.

257
00:12:58,802 --> 00:13:00,102
Inspector Megure!

258
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:03,802
I heard that a murder's been committed, but did Thief Kid do it?

259
00:13:03,802 --> 00:13:06,002
Could there have been a problem with the security measures?

260
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:08,702
No comment. No comment!

261
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:13,102
But is it true that Mr. Oikawa's new painting "Blue Storm" was stolen?

262
00:13:13,102 --> 00:13:16,902
Could it be that you're assuming that Thief Kid would never kill?

263
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:18,302
I said no comment!

264
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:19,502
Can you comment on the investigation so far?

265
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:21,202
Please tell us!

266
00:13:21,202 --> 00:13:23,302
Hey, just where do you think you're touching?

267
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:27,502
A knife and stun gun were used to commit the murder.

268
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:30,502
There are traces of a stun gun on his neck.

269
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:33,802
He probably realized that Mr. Kanbara was there when he was stealing.

270
00:13:33,802 --> 00:13:35,502
He then used the stun gun to pass him out.

271
00:13:35,502 --> 00:13:37,702
And since the culprit feared that his face was seen,

272
00:13:37,702 --> 00:13:40,202
he stabbed Mr. Kanbara with the knife and killed him.

273
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:41,802
And what about the fingerprints?

274
00:13:41,802 --> 00:13:44,302
Nothing was found on the stun gun,

275
00:13:44,302 --> 00:13:47,302
but Mr. Oikawa's fingerprints were found on the handle of the knife.

276
00:13:47,302 --> 00:13:49,602
Then don't tell me that he...

277
00:13:49,602 --> 00:13:50,702
No.

278
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:52,402
It would've been impossible for him

279
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:56,602
to find someone the in the dark without any light source

280
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,702
and kill him in such a short time.

281
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:01,902
He said he heard Mr. Kanbara groaning and coincidentally found him.

282
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:06,602
He then carried Mr. Kanbara and seemed to have touched the knife then.

283
00:14:06,602 --> 00:14:09,702
That's the reason why his fingerprints were detected on the knife.

284
00:14:09,702 --> 00:14:13,002
The culprit escaped after kicking the paint brush stands out of the window

285
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:15,002
when I came into the room after breaking the door down.

286
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:18,702
Which means that the culprit was in the room from before the blackout?

287
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:21,502
Yeah, he was probably hiding in the attic or something

288
00:14:21,502 --> 00:14:22,702
and as soon as the lights went out,

289
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:25,302
he probably came out of that air conditioner and snuck in.

290
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:27,402
How did he black the place out?

291
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:28,502
A timer was probably set

292
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:32,202
so that appliances that eat a lot of electricity all turned on at once,

293
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:34,202
causing the fuse to blow.

294
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:35,602
Maybe if we checked more carefully,

295
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:37,602
we could've found it beforehand.

296
00:14:37,602 --> 00:14:41,402
But Mr. Oikawa received the warning only yesterday morning,

297
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:45,002
and we received the report last night.

298
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:47,802
Which means, the warning was sent out

299
00:14:47,802 --> 00:14:49,702
after everything had been prepared.

300
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:53,102
And? Did you see the culprit escape from the window?

301
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:55,302
No. In preparation for intruders from outside,

302
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:58,102
I ordered the lights shining on the window to be subdued.

303
00:14:58,102 --> 00:14:59,502
Since it was too bright,

304
00:14:59,502 --> 00:15:02,402
it would be like telling the thief where the painting is.

305
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,502
The only thing we got is the two paint brush stands

306
00:15:06,502 --> 00:15:08,102
and a huge number of paint brushes that came falling

307
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:09,702
when the culprit escaped from the window.

308
00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:13,402
Okay, Megure. You can take things from here.

309
00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:15,902
Look through the images in the surveillance camera

310
00:15:15,902 --> 00:15:17,402
and arrest the culprit, will you?

311
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:20,002
Hey, hey. The one who did it is Thief Kid, isn't it?

312
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,602
You're in charge of this case, aren't you?

313
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:23,902
This case isn't connected to Thief Kid.

314
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:26,702
He never takes a person's life.

315
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:29,002
Inspector Megure.

316
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:31,302
The video images from the atelier's surveillance camera

317
00:15:31,302 --> 00:15:32,802
are ready to be played.

318
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:35,402
This is an hour before the incident.

319
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,202
This is right after Mr. Oikawa checked his painting.

320
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:42,002
And this is the image right after when the lights are turned back on.

321
00:15:42,002 --> 00:15:45,502
I can see that the images are cut off before and after the blackout,

322
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:48,802
but why is there a cut before and after he checked the painting?

323
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:52,102
I asked them to turn the camera off.

324
00:15:52,102 --> 00:15:54,802
If anyone sees the painting before it's completed,

325
00:15:54,802 --> 00:15:58,202
all the feelings I put into it would vanish.

326
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:00,402
I've been doing so from long ago.

327
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:02,302
According to Inspector Nakamori's story,

328
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:05,902
after you finished checking your painting, Mr. Kanbara came into the room.

329
00:16:05,902 --> 00:16:07,102
Yes.

330
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:09,602
He said that he couldn't trust the police or detective

331
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,002
and insisted that he'd guard the painting himself.

332
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:14,102
Father is a very stubborn person

333
00:16:14,102 --> 00:16:16,002
and it didn't seem like I could persuade him,

334
00:16:16,002 --> 00:16:19,102
so I thought I'd have Inspector Nakamori convince him.

335
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:22,102
For the sake of my father's safety, I locked the door

336
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:25,802
and went to call Inspector Nakamori when there was a sudden blackout.

337
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:27,502
Since father didn't answer,

338
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:29,902
I rushed to open the door,

339
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:31,802
but I mistakenly dropped the key

340
00:16:31,802 --> 00:16:33,502
and couldn't find it right away.

341
00:16:33,502 --> 00:16:34,602
I see.

342
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:38,802
So that's why Inspector Nakamori decided to break the door open.

343
00:16:38,802 --> 00:16:41,302
-But isn't it strange? -Huh?

344
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:44,202
Because after you finished checking your painting,

345
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:46,102
you're talking on the transceiver.

346
00:16:46,102 --> 00:16:47,602
Although your voice can't be heard,

347
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:50,902
you asked Inspector Nakamori to turn the surveillance camera back on

348
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:53,002
since you finished checking your painting, right?

349
00:16:53,002 --> 00:16:54,602
Yes.

350
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:57,202
If Mr. Kanbara came in at that time,

351
00:16:57,202 --> 00:16:58,802
all you had to do was use the transceiver

352
00:16:58,802 --> 00:17:00,102
to ask Inspector Nakamori to come, right?

353
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:04,102
Well, father snatched the transceiver away from me,

354
00:17:04,102 --> 00:17:06,602
saying that he didn't want to be interrupted by anyone.

355
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:08,402
It seems that the transceiver

356
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,702
was found in Mr. Kanbara's pocket a while later.

357
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:12,802
Yeah.

358
00:17:12,802 --> 00:17:15,202
But can't we think of it this way?

359
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:18,002
When it blacked out, Mr. Kanbara decided to protect the painting

360
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:20,302
by hiding it at some place.

361
00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:23,802
An atelier probably has many shelves where the canvas can be put away.

362
00:17:23,802 --> 00:17:25,302
That can't be.

363
00:17:25,302 --> 00:17:27,002
Before I checked the painting,

364
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:30,102
I closed all the doors of the canvas shelves and locked them.

365
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:34,302
If Thief Kid broke in, he would have less places to hide the painting.

366
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:35,502
And where is that key?

367
00:17:35,502 --> 00:17:39,402
It is with the atelier keys that I lost during the blackout.

368
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:41,502
It was found later in the corner of the corridor

369
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:44,002
and is with the forensic officer now.

370
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:49,102
Could someone take advantage of the blackout and snuck into the atelier?

371
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,402
It can't be.

372
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:54,702
Just before the blackout, the Riot Task Force who was guarding the room

373
00:17:54,702 --> 00:17:57,502
have checked to see that the two doors were locked.

374
00:17:57,502 --> 00:17:59,902
But Thief Kid can open locks easily.

375
00:17:59,902 --> 00:18:03,302
The Riot Task Force members were by told Inspector Nakamori,

376
00:18:03,302 --> 00:18:05,302
that in case the lights should go out,

377
00:18:05,302 --> 00:18:07,902
grab the door knob and not let go.

378
00:18:07,902 --> 00:18:11,002
In other words, someone who was hiding in the attic

379
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:13,302
came down to the atelier when the blackout occured.

380
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:16,202
He killed Mr. Kanbara who was in the room,

381
00:18:16,202 --> 00:18:18,202
took the painting and escaped.

382
00:18:18,202 --> 00:18:20,302
This seems to be immovable fact.

383
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:25,702
But I wonder if it's really the Thief Kid?

384
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:28,202
It's hard to conclude just yet.

385
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:31,502
After all, there are no cases in which he committed murder in the past.

386
00:18:31,502 --> 00:18:33,902
But something could've got into him this time.

387
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:37,102
You sure have a cold attitude towards Thief Kid, don't you?

388
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:39,102
Of course!

389
00:18:39,102 --> 00:18:41,902
The Thief Kid is the enemy of the police!

390
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:46,402
Officer Sato, do you have any reason for wanting to back Thief Kid up?

391
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:47,802
So what if I have my reasons?

392
00:18:47,802 --> 00:18:52,602
How could you tell whether it was Thief Kid or not by looking at the note?

393
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:55,702
Because of the drawing on the warning note.

394
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:59,102
He always draws a new one for each notice.

395
00:18:59,102 --> 00:19:03,502
If someone were to copy one of them from a newspaper or from TV,

396
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:06,702
they would be caught instantly.

397
00:19:06,702 --> 00:19:09,502
However, according to the 2nd section that Inspector Nakamori belongs to,

398
00:19:09,502 --> 00:19:11,402
the drawing this time didn't fall into either category

399
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:13,602
and was exactly like his drawings despite being drawn with new lines,

400
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:15,202
and they deemed it to be genuine.

401
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:20,202
Then somebody who's a good drawer could be copying Thief Kid.

402
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:23,802
Like a comic drawer or an illustrator.

403
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:25,702
Or even a painter.

404
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:27,202
Hey, Conan!

405
00:19:27,202 --> 00:19:28,902
I was just stating examples.

406
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:32,702
Well, I can't draw cartoon-like drawings like he does though.

407
00:19:32,702 --> 00:19:35,202
From the view point of a professional painter,

408
00:19:35,202 --> 00:19:38,202
I think that the drawing is genuine.

409
00:19:38,202 --> 00:19:39,802
I think so, too!

410
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:41,202
Thief Kid is to blame.

411
00:19:41,202 --> 00:19:43,302
He's a villain after all!

412
00:19:43,302 --> 00:19:47,002
Please share your wisdom with us to catch the villain then.

413
00:19:48,502 --> 00:19:50,002
My telephone's ringing.

414
00:19:51,702 --> 00:19:52,702
This one's ringing.

415
00:19:52,702 --> 00:19:55,202
You have two cell phones? Why is that?

416
00:19:55,202 --> 00:19:59,302
Yes, I have one for work and one for private use.

417
00:19:59,302 --> 00:20:01,802
One of the phones seems to have blood on it.

418
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:04,102
Right after I carried father who was covered with blood,

419
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:08,402
I called my relatives to tell them of what happened using this cell phone.

420
00:20:08,402 --> 00:20:10,602
So I guess that's when the blood rubbed off.

421
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:11,902
Yes, it's me.

422
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:15,202
I'm sort of busy now, so can you call me later?

423
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:19,402
I'm sorry, but may I go change clothes?

424
00:20:19,402 --> 00:20:22,002
I'd like to get out of these clothes with my father's blood smeared on.

425
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:25,202
Please go through a body check first then.

426
00:20:25,202 --> 00:20:29,202
Inspector Nakamori already did a very thorough body check on me.

427
00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:54,002
I've come to get the truth.

428
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,702
Thief Kid?

429
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:07,402
"Fragile equipment inside. Do not open."

430
00:21:07,402 --> 00:21:09,202
Hey, come here a second.

431
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,802
Do you have any idea what's in this bag?

432
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:13,402
Just leave it as is!

433
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:15,502
You'll get yelled at if you touch it without permission.

434
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:16,602
Hey, sonny!

435
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,402
May I have a word with you?

436
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:20,502
What is it?

437
00:21:20,502 --> 00:21:22,902
I've been wondering from some time ago,

438
00:21:22,902 --> 00:21:24,402
but your back pocket...

439
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:25,402
Huh?

440
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:27,902
There seems to be something inside.

441
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:29,302
-That's... -What?

442
00:21:29,302 --> 00:21:31,902
Look, it's a card!

443
00:21:31,902 --> 00:21:33,102
Thief Kid!

444
00:21:33,102 --> 00:21:35,602
You've made a great discovery, sonny!

445
00:21:35,602 --> 00:21:37,602
I'm sure that Thief Kid put them inside

446
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:39,502
some time before the incident occurred.

447
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:42,002
Yeah. I've got to tell the Inspector right away!

448
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:44,302
So it was Thief Kid after all!

449
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:48,002
Is that what you want me to say?

450
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:49,202
Huh?

451
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:50,802
Just as I thought.

452
00:21:50,802 --> 00:21:54,702
He figured a child would be excited about anything that involved Thief Kid.

453
00:21:54,702 --> 00:21:57,302
So that's why he invited me here.

454
00:21:57,302 --> 00:22:00,902
But if he got these cards ready,

455
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,502
he would've left them behind at the scene of the murder.

456
00:22:02,502 --> 00:22:06,102
This means it's genuine and he only just found it.

457
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:11,102
Inspector Nakamori who did the body check wouldn't have overlooked this.

458
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:15,602
In other words, the one who put these cards in Mr. Oikawa's clothes

459
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:18,402
must be someone who came here after the body check was done.

460
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:24,802
I'll rip off your snobbish mask today for sure, Thief Kid!

461
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:28,402
Under the golden light of this full moon.

462
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,402
"Next Episode" -We still can't come to any conclusion,

463
00:23:59,402 --> 00:24:02,202
but he's certainly a prime suspect.

464
00:24:02,202 --> 00:24:07,402
Well, if Thief Kid was the culprit, he would already have fled somewhere.

465
00:24:07,402 --> 00:24:10,702
I've figured out something that might be a hint.

466
00:24:10,702 --> 00:24:12,502
May I try an experiment?

467
00:24:12,502 --> 00:24:13,902
It should be somewhere here.

468
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:17,902
There it is!

469
00:24:21,602 --> 00:24:27,002
Next Conan, "Thief Kid and the Four Masterpieces (Part 2)"

470
00:24:42,602 --> 00:24:44,502
Next Conan's Hint:

471
00:24:44,502 --> 00:24:47,302
"Something that is there even if you think it's not"

472
00:24:47,302 --> 00:24:48,802
I wonder if Kid's really here?

473
00:24:48,802 --> 00:24:49,802
I know that at least one kid is here.

474
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:52,002
And that kid is me.
