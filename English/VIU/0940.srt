1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,950
"Kaho Mizunuma (24), Office Worker" -I'm free Sunday.

2
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,275
And send.

3
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:21,857
"Mouri Detective Agency" -She's missing?

4
00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:23,557
Kaho Mizunuma.

5
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:24,937
She's my girlfriend.

6
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:27,457
"Jun Naruse (27), Kaho's Boyfriend" -She suddenly disappeared

7
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,357
a few days ago.

8
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:30,957
She's pretty.

9
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,457
Yeah.

10
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:36,858
We planned to go ring shopping on Sunday.

11
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:40,958
Please find her! Please!

12
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:50,557
In my eyes are maximum creation.

13
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:52,357
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

14
00:00:52,358 --> 00:00:53,957
The client makes a desperate request.

15
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,157
An unexpected development leads to the answer.

16
00:00:56,158 --> 00:00:57,557
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,357
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:01,658
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:52,783
"The Missing Girlfriend."

20
00:02:55,313 --> 00:02:58,012
Did Ms. Kaho lived here alone?

21
00:02:58,013 --> 00:03:00,713
Yes, since about three months ago.

22
00:03:02,913 --> 00:03:05,212
Why did you two comes with us?

23
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:06,712
I mean...

24
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:07,913
Right?

25
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:17,713
I don't see anything particularly suspicious.

26
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:31,413
Why only here?

27
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:35,112
Could she have gone to visit family or friends?

28
00:03:35,113 --> 00:03:38,012
Her parents are already dead.

29
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:41,612
She hasn't visited any friends or coworkers.

30
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:42,913
I see.

31
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:55,013
Huh? Was Kaho...

32
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:57,912
It's an emergency!

33
00:03:57,913 --> 00:04:00,312
The police just called!

34
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:02,713
Kaho is...

35
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:12,512
Excuse me.

36
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:13,712
Conan!

37
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:16,013
Hey, wait! Conan?

38
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:20,513
"Kaho Mizunuma."

39
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:27,212
Suicide?

40
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:29,113
No, this is...

41
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:36,112
I doubt we'll find a body in this current.

42
00:04:36,113 --> 00:04:37,113
Yeah.

43
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:40,312
It rained all day yesterday.

44
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:44,012
But these shoes and ID card aren't wet.

45
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:45,212
Hey.

46
00:04:45,213 --> 00:04:47,413
Gosh. You're always snooping around.

47
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:53,712
That's because Kaho Mizunuma jumped from the bridge at 5:15 am,

48
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:56,312
long after it stopped raining.

49
00:04:56,313 --> 00:05:00,312
What? How do you know the exact time?

50
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:04,313
Because someone happened to witness Ms. Kaho jumping.

51
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:06,513
A witness?

52
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:10,112
"Tetsuya Ushio (21)" -This morning I came to deliver the paper...

53
00:05:10,113 --> 00:05:12,112
"Newspaper Delivery Boy College Student" -at the usual time.

54
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:13,113
That's when I saw...

55
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,312
Hey, you!

56
00:05:15,313 --> 00:05:17,112
What?

57
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:18,913
Wait, wait! Hey!

58
00:05:22,313 --> 00:05:23,713
Was that...

59
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:26,612
As far as I can tell from that video,

60
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:29,612
it was definitely a suicide.

61
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:31,612
No way.

62
00:05:31,613 --> 00:05:33,012
Mr. Naruse.

63
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:35,713
You're pretty amazing, though.

64
00:05:36,913 --> 00:05:39,212
You took such a good video.

65
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,012
It happened suddenly, right?

66
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:43,613
You're right.

67
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:49,712
Wait. Please.

68
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:52,012
It's just a coincidence that it came out well.

69
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:54,412
Come to think of it, this place is pretty far

70
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:56,712
from Ms. Kaho's house, right?

71
00:05:56,713 --> 00:05:58,912
How did Ms. Kaho get here?

72
00:05:58,913 --> 00:06:00,312
Well, obviously...

73
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:04,012
The trains and buses would've just started running by then.

74
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:06,412
Her shoes are too clean for someone walking outside

75
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:08,312
after it stopped raining.

76
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:10,213
Oh, in that case...

77
00:06:17,713 --> 00:06:21,513
"Maki Ohara (46), Taxi Driver" -Well, well. So she did die.

78
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:26,812
Could you tell us what happened when you gave her a ride?

79
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:28,912
It was around 2:30 am.

80
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:32,012
I picked her up on the road and drove for about thirty minutes.

81
00:06:32,013 --> 00:06:34,612
We arrived here around three.

82
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:36,212
Her story's accurate.

83
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:39,412
It's what we confirmed on the security camera footage.

84
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:42,712
She got off here looking like she was going to die.

85
00:06:42,713 --> 00:06:44,112
I knew she'd do it.

86
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:46,513
Then why didn't you stop her?

87
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:50,912
Not letting people die when they want to?

88
00:06:50,913 --> 00:06:53,113
Is that the right thing to do?

89
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:56,913
But something's not right.

90
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:02,513
Don't women carry handbags?

91
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:08,812
Come to think of it, Ms. Kaho was carrying a handbag

92
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:10,913
in the security camera footage.

93
00:07:12,413 --> 00:07:14,513
I wonder where it went.

94
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:18,712
I don't know.

95
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:22,312
She took her bag when she got off.

96
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:25,913
And didn't Ms. Kaho get here around three?

97
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,912
What was she doing for over two hours

98
00:07:29,913 --> 00:07:31,812
until she jumped after five?

99
00:07:31,813 --> 00:07:34,712
Probably mentally preparing herself.

100
00:07:34,713 --> 00:07:37,612
She must've gotten rid of her bag then, too.

101
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:41,712
We have the witness and video to prove it.

102
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:44,212
It was definitely a suicide.

103
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,813
Hey, officer.

104
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:48,712
Can I leave now?

105
00:07:48,713 --> 00:07:50,912
I work nights and haven't gotten any sleep.

106
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:52,712
Can I go, too?

107
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:56,212
Yes. Thank you for your cooperation.

108
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:59,712
We might ask you for more details later.

109
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,213
We appreciate your continued cooperation.

110
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:08,212
Hey, as long as she's here, let's take a taxi home.

111
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:10,012
Right, Ran?

112
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:12,012
What? But...

113
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:15,812
I don't mind, as long as you pay.

114
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:18,612
Why don't you guys ride with us?

115
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:20,813
The police will pay our fare, right?

116
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:26,912
I supposed we can cover your transportation costs.

117
00:08:26,913 --> 00:08:28,412
Lucky.

118
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:30,613
If you insist.

119
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:32,912
What about you, Dad?

120
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:35,412
I'll stay a little longer.

121
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:38,413
Then we'll head home. Let's go, Conan.

122
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:50,813
There should be a clue in this video.

123
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:55,112
How long are you going to keep watching that? It's my phone.

124
00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:57,913
Conan, Mr. Naruse is here, too.

125
00:08:59,013 --> 00:09:00,613
Sorry.

126
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:07,312
Gosh. Kids these days.

127
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,212
I managed to stop them,

128
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:11,413
but what now?

129
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:15,812
That good luck charm...

130
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:18,912
Oh, it's my daughter.

131
00:09:18,913 --> 00:09:21,012
She's dead now, though.

132
00:09:21,013 --> 00:09:22,412
It was an illness.

133
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:24,312
I see.

134
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,112
She was my only family.

135
00:09:27,113 --> 00:09:29,512
Now I live alone and carefree.

136
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:32,312
Really? She kind of looks like

137
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:34,412
the girl who killed herself.

138
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:37,013
No way. They look nothing alike!

139
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,913
Don't compared her to a girl who killed herself!

140
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:46,013
There's no need to be so angry.

141
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:51,413
I gotta go to the bathroom.

142
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:59,012
Hey, Ran?

143
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:00,312
What?

144
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:01,413
Is this...

145
00:10:02,413 --> 00:10:03,912
"Eyewitness Information Wanted! Face Unknown, Skinny Man."

146
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:06,312
"Long Brown Hair" -I think it was three months ago.

147
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:08,012
"Tattoos on Both Arms" -A female college student fell down

148
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:10,512
from stairs at a park and died.

149
00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:12,312
Isn't the park where this happened

150
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:14,313
near Ms. Kaho's house?

151
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:18,712
You're right. It's right next door.

152
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:20,812
Oh, that?

153
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:24,412
We keep it posted at the family's request,

154
00:10:24,413 --> 00:10:26,813
but even the police say it was an accident.

155
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:30,613
I understand how they feel, though.

156
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:33,713
Is this really a man?

157
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:39,213
Oh, nothing. I just thought they could also look like a woman.

158
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:45,712
Excuse me.

159
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:47,413
Be right there.

160
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:58,312
Huh? You're going to dye your hair black?

161
00:10:58,313 --> 00:11:01,212
I've got an interview for a new job.

162
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:04,313
The money's good, but they seem strict.

163
00:11:05,513 --> 00:11:08,412
I can't imagine you with black hair.

164
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:09,513
Shut up.

165
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:14,012
Wait a minute.

166
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:15,213
In that case...

167
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:18,512
What is it, Conan?

168
00:11:18,513 --> 00:11:20,512
I need to go back to the bridge!

169
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,612
What?

170
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:23,013
Wait, Conan!

171
00:11:32,413 --> 00:11:34,312
What is it, Conan?

172
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:36,712
He forgot something.

173
00:11:36,713 --> 00:11:38,913
Gosh. Why did we have to come, too?

174
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:45,913
There might still be some trace of it.

175
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:47,913
Hey!

176
00:11:48,513 --> 00:11:51,512
You're still wandering around here?

177
00:11:51,513 --> 00:11:54,213
Mr. Mouri, that's dangerous.

178
00:11:58,313 --> 00:12:00,113
-Oh, no! -Conan!

179
00:12:01,113 --> 00:12:02,113
Hey!

180
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:03,413
Conan!

181
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,840
That's it! That light!

182
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,240
-Conan! -Conan!

183
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,840
Darn!

184
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,040
Conan!

185
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,439
Ms. Maki!

186
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,640
Grab on!

187
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,639
Ran!

188
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Pull! Heave!

189
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,340
It's hot.

190
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,439
Thank you very much.

191
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,740
Thank you.

192
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,740
Good thing you didn't die.

193
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,240
"Maki Ohara."

194
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,039
You're a very good swimmer.

195
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,540
I used to swim at the National Athletic Meet.

196
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,840
Could it be...

197
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,339
I see.

198
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,939
So that's how it is.

199
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,839
Sorry, Conan.

200
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,739
Gosh. This only happened because you were wandering around.

201
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,740
You're all amazing, though.

202
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,939
Even though you couldn't see her face clearly,

203
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,140
you all knew the person in the video was Ms. Kaho.

204
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,240
Well, she had the same hair and clothes.

205
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,939
I see. I've figured it out.

206
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,640
Figured out what, Mouri?

207
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,140
The truth behind this case.

208
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,739
Case? Wasn't Kaho's death a suicide?

209
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,540
No, Ms. Kaho didn't kill herself.

210
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,540
Didn't you see my video?

211
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,839
That was clearly a suicide.

212
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,740
Only if the person in the video really was Ms. Kaho.

213
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,439
Yes, that was

214
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,840
a different person disguised as Ms. Kaho.

215
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,539
Right? You have a similar build as her,

216
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,439
and you're good at swimming.

217
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,940
Ms. Maki Ohara.

218
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,039
You faked Ms. Kaho's suicide.

219
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,139
You knew that Mr. Ushio

220
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,740
would pass by the bridge at that time.

221
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,739
So she waited for me to arrive to jump.

222
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,640
That's why you were able to film the video.

223
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,039
What proof do you have?

224
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,439
What? Well...

225
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,240
It's her shoelaces, right?

226
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,039
The shoes in Ms. Kaho's room

227
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,039
and the ones found at the crime scene.

228
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,739
"Over wrap, At Kaho's House" -were tied differently.

229
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,139
"Under wrap, At Crime Scene."

230
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,439
You said someone must've retied them,

231
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,639
remember?

232
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,539
Uh, yeah.

233
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,739
But why would I...

234
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,339
In Mr. Ushio's video,

235
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,940
there's something flashing.

236
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,639
Hey, you!

237
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,439
What?

238
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,840
Wait, wait! Hey!

239
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,439
When I fell from the bridge,

240
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,940
I saw Ran's necklace sparkle in the same way.

241
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,740
That was probably Ms. Maki's necklace.

242
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,339
It... it wasn't me!

243
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,240
I'm sure that Kaho girl wore a necklace, too!

244
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,139
No,

245
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,340
Ms. Kaho never wore any jewelry.

246
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,239
Even when she wore a dress, she didn't even wear a watch.

247
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,439
Ms. Kaho must have been

248
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,240
allergic to metals.

249
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,740
We'll know as soon as we analyze the video.

250
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,640
That's right. I killed her.

251
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,339
I'm drowning in debt

252
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,539
from my dead daughter's medical bills.

253
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,339
When I saw her credit card, I couldn't help myself.

254
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,639
Then that long black hair...

255
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,939
That's right, a wig.

256
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,039
A keepsake of the daughter who lost her hair to illness.

257
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,640
I never thought I'd be able to use it like this.

258
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,139
No.

259
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,140
That's not what happened, Ms. Maki.

260
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,540
Well, that settles this...

261
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,740
I thought this was over.

262
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,040
Wait a minute.

263
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,239
Why did Ms. Kaho

264
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,239
come to this place late at night?

265
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,239
Isn't that because...

266
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,740
Mr. Naruse.

267
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,439
Remember what you said when we met?

268
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,640
We planned to go ring shopping on Sunday.

269
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,739
Ms. Kaho, a woman allergic to metals, wanted to buy a ring?

270
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,439
No way.

271
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
It's a big fat lie.

272
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,439
Then why did Mr. Naruse say that?

273
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,240
Mr. Naruse, you're sweating.

274
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,040
Why don't you roll up your sleeves?

275
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,939
You can't, can you?

276
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,039
You're afraid your tattoo sleeves will be seen.

277
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,639
Tattoos?

278
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,539
Could it be...

279
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,839
I'm glad I had Conan drag you around

280
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
until you gave yourself away.

281
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,239
That's right.

282
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,139
You're the man who pushed the student

283
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,540
down the stairs at the park three months ago.

284
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,340
And Ms. Kaho...

285
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,740
I'm free Sunday. And send.

286
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,439
If you tell anyone about this,

287
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,739
I'll kill you and your entire family.

288
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,540
I'll be watching.

289
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,039
The curtains in Ms. Kaho's apartment were closed,

290
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,539
and there was dust beneath them.

291
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,639
It's because she'd been unable to approach the window for a long time.

292
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,940
That proves you persistently followed her around and watched her.

293
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,739
At the end of her rope, Ms. Kaho came to this bridge.

294
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,239
And then...

295
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,239
That's right, she died.

296
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,539
There's no proof to back up your reasoning.

297
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,940
There is proof.

298
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,440
Ms. Maki.

299
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,539
Your driver's license had no mention of corrective lenses

300
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,739
that's required for persons with impaired vision.

301
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,339
If you have such good vision, why did you purchase

302
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,739
a contact solution.

303
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,439
Rather, for whom did you purchase contact solution

304
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,540
and two lunch boxes?

305
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,639
Ms. Maki,

306
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,739
you didn't kill anyone.

307
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,439
You simply faked Ms. Kaho's death

308
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,839
to protect her from Mr. Naruse.

309
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,439
Then Ms. Kaho is...

310
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,839
That's right. She's alive

311
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,739
and hidden in Ms. Maki's home.

312
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,939
You're lying!

313
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,440
It's true!

314
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Kaho!

315
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,139
Ms. Maki.

316
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,139
Kaho.

317
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,839
I was so scared.

318
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,939
I was so worried,

319
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,439
but the police

320
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,139
wouldn't take me seriously.

321
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,840
When I lost hope, I went to that bridge.

322
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,339
I'm terribly sorry.

323
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,439
So much time had passed,

324
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,339
and it had been treated as an accident.

325
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,939
But I won't run anymore.

326
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,840
For Ms. Maki, who risked herself to protect me.

327
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,339
I saw him.

328
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,440
He did it!

329
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,339
Thank you, Ms. Maki.

330
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,939
But why were you so desperate to protect Ms. Kaho?

331
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,339
He's right.

332
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,040
You tried to take the blame for killing Ms. Kaho.

333
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,540
Do you remember when you told me about what happened?

334
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,839
I was so angry.

335
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,939
At Naruse, of course, but also you.

336
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,240
You thoughtlessly said you wanted to die over something so small.

337
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,839
Why did my daughter who wanted to live die,

338
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,239
but this girl is alive?

339
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,139
I thought about killing you,

340
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,040
just like you wanted.

341
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,540
But then...

342
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,040
I had to help you.

343
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,540
Ms. Maki.

344
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,140
"Dead Student. Suspect Jun Naruse." -Goodness.

345
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,840
What a ridiculous client.

346
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,539
"We baked these together." -Conan, do you think you can become family...

347
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,339
"Thank you. From Maki and Kaho." -even if you're not related by blood?

348
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,740
I'm sure you can.

349
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,340
"Next Episode" -About Maria Higashio...

350
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,640
It's Maria shoes and backpack.

351
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,640
It's open?

352
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,339
The bookcase fell.

353
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,040
It's likely she is been trapped for over six hours.

354
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,740
Huh? Hattori is calling.

355
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,140
-Hello... -You punk!

356
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,439
Next Conan,

357
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,340
"Find Maria (Part 1)"
