1
00:00:00,758 --> 00:00:02,958
Pops Kogoro was invited over to the

2
00:00:02,958 --> 00:00:06,158
university festival of his alma mater, Beika University.

3
00:00:06,158 --> 00:00:08,758
Ran, Sonoko and I who accompanied him there

4
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:13,358
were called over by Mr. Sonsaku Tsujiei, a movie art major,

5
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:15,458
and taken to the haunted "Screaming Hospital"

6
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:18,158
that he was managing.

7
00:00:19,758 --> 00:00:22,458
He asks Ran and the others who have encountered numerous cases

8
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:25,358
to check out how good the zombies look.

9
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:29,258
Anna Tadami in particular,

10
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:30,858
seemed to be very confident in the zombie

11
00:00:30,858 --> 00:00:33,058
she was performing.

12
00:00:34,058 --> 00:00:37,458
However, Anna ended up showing us,

13
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,658
how it actually looked to be dead.

14
00:00:40,158 --> 00:00:44,158
She suddenly had a convulsion before our eyes and died.

15
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:48,258
She died of potassium cyanide poisoning,

16
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:49,458
and it was thought at first that she drank it herself

17
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,058
and committed suicide,

18
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:52,758
but, I'm not being deceived!

19
00:00:52,758 --> 00:00:55,558
This is homicide made to look like suicide!

20
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:57,158
Moreover, it turns out that this case

21
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:59,058
has something to do with the death of their friend,

22
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:03,858
Mr. Hashiguchi who killed himself and died a month ago.

23
00:01:03,858 --> 00:01:08,158
Who on earth was it that poisoned Anna in the dark?

24
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:13,658
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

25
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:15,858
You must be true to yourself.

26
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:17,858
There's a ghostly phenomenon at the school festival?

27
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:19,858
Solve the mystery of the moving corpse.

28
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:21,458
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,558
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:26,258
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

31
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:09,809
"Screaming Operation Room (Part 2)"

32
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:13,909
It's from that time on, wasn't it? That Anna changed.

33
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:17,109
Yeah. She suddenly started saying that it was a tribute to Hashiguchi

34
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:18,609
and began making the graduation project movie,

35
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:21,109
and started getting carried away with this haunted room too.

36
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:23,609
But, isn't it natural to want to try hard

37
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:25,709
for a friend who has crossed over?

38
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,709
But, she was way out of line!

39
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,409
There was a time when she overdosed on sleeping pills

40
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:33,409
and was taken to the hospital too.

41
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:35,009
Her reason for doing so, was that she wanted to experience

42
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,709
how it felt to be in between life and death

43
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,809
and use it as reference as to how to look really dead.

44
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:42,009
-Right? -Yeah.

45
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:44,109
One day I thought she was being quite reticent

46
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:47,309
and found out that she had nails in her mouth the whole day.

47
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:49,109
Nails?

48
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:51,509
Maybe Anna

49
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:54,909
had the capsule with the poison inside it in her mouth.

50
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:57,309
Right! It's the same as the nails!

51
00:03:57,309 --> 00:04:00,109
Then, she may have accidentally bitten it and...

52
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:02,409
Therefore, before getting to experience how it felt to be

53
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,809
in between life and death,

54
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:06,309
she ended up really dying.

55
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:10,209
So, did she actually commit suicide after all then?

56
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,209
I wonder if it's really so?

57
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:17,409
Conan?

58
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:21,809
Because look at the cheek of this woman!

59
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:25,509
There's what looks to be a real scratch, not make-up.

60
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:28,309
It even looks as if the blood had smeared!

61
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:32,309
Maybe somebody tried to cover her mouth by force

62
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:34,709
so she in an attempt to pull free mistakenly scratched herself

63
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,209
with her own nails?

64
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,109
What?

65
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:42,309
Inspector! There are traces of skin and blood between her nails.

66
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:45,109
What?

67
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:47,409
In other words, someone tried to shove the poisoned capsule

68
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:49,009
into her mouth

69
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:51,309
and covered her mouth and nose

70
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:53,609
until she swallowed it?

71
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:56,709
But, if so, she would've already been dead

72
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:59,209
by the time Ran and the others got here.

73
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:01,709
She was really kicking her legs up and down

74
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:03,209
and struggling, right?

75
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:05,009
Yes.

76
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,009
I see, so that's what happened!

77
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,209
Sonoko?

78
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,709
The culprit came before we did, made Anna drink the poison

79
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:16,309
and killed her, then hid under the bed!

80
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:19,709
He shook the bed himself, kicked his legs up and down,

81
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:21,709
then flipped the sheet that was on her over

82
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:23,809
to show Anna's leg.

83
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:25,709
Then he slipped out of bed,

84
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:29,909
and made it look as if Anna was still alive!

85
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:33,109
In other words, the only one who could've done it

86
00:05:33,109 --> 00:05:35,709
would've been you, Mutusmi, right?

87
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:38,009
What? Me?

88
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:40,509
Being as small as you are,

89
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:43,609
you could slip out of the bed without anyone noticing.

90
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,109
Besides, you're the only one here who's...

91
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:48,409
wearing sandals!

92
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:49,909
You would be able to wear sandals right away

93
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,909
even if you came out of the bed, right?

94
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,309
You know what?

95
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:55,309
Her legs weren't visible anyway,

96
00:05:55,309 --> 00:05:57,809
so she wouldn't have had to take off her shoes, right?

97
00:05:57,809 --> 00:06:00,609
Then, the next person that's small is you, so you're the culprit!

98
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:02,609
You seem to be much faster than Mutsumi, besides.

99
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:06,509
Idiot! I've got a sprained ankle, you know!

100
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:08,609
I can somehow manage to walk normally

101
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:10,409
but I wouldn't be able to kick my legs up and down

102
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:12,809
because it would be too painful.

103
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:15,609
See, look! I've got compress on it

104
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,809
and it's held in place with a bandage, isn't it?

105
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:21,809
Then, it's you who's been fidgeting for a while now!

106
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:23,109
You're probably not comfortable

107
00:06:23,109 --> 00:06:24,909
because of feelings of guilt, right?

108
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:28,209
I'm fidgeting with my foot because my athlete's foot itches.

109
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:32,209
Hey, your shoe is bright red?

110
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,409
Well, I was trying to relieve the itch

111
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:37,209
by holding my foot down with the other foot but...

112
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:38,709
That's blood paint.

113
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:41,109
You must've stepped on it somewhere.

114
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,509
Then, maybe it's when you shook the bed a while ago?

115
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:46,909
Because the blood paint burst out

116
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:50,309
would accumulate under the upper right leg of the bed.

117
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,009
At any rate, anyone of you three,

118
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:56,709
after poisoning her, sneak under the bed,

119
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:59,309
and make it look as if she were alive

120
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:03,809
then appear again as if nothing had happened.

121
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:05,409
Oh my.

122
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:07,609
We couldn't have.

123
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:10,409
As you can see,

124
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:13,709
mannequins of a doctor standing are on both sides of the bed.

125
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:16,009
So, even if you try to sneak out from the side of the bed,

126
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,009
you would bump into the mannequins

127
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:18,709
and give yourself away on the spot.

128
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,409
If you tried to get away from the place

129
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:21,709
where there are no obstacles,

130
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:22,709
you would be in full view of these girls

131
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,309
that were standing at the head of the bed.

132
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:25,609
Besides!

133
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:27,609
This bed is handmade so...

134
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:30,009
two adults could never get on it.

135
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,109
Handmade?

136
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:34,809
Yeah, because Anna said that it would creak

137
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:38,509
when she struggled and give more impact that way.

138
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:40,709
Since it's so uncomfortable,

139
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:44,609
others who had to play the role didn't care for it, though.

140
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:49,209
Maybe Anna scratched herself on her cheek too.

141
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:53,409
Because with real blood coming out, it would have more impact.

142
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,309
Anna would think of something like that.

143
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,709
Yeah.

144
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,509
I wonder if she committed suicide after all, then?

145
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:02,909
No. The position of the scratch is one that was made

146
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:05,709
when she fought back at the culprit.

147
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:07,309
But, I don't understand.

148
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:11,409
How on earth did the culprit make it look like she was alive?

149
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:20,809
On the back side of the upper cover by the legs is a red streak.

150
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:23,509
It's water based paint.

151
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:25,309
Is it blood paint?

152
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:29,309
Wait a sec. If I remember correctly, under the bed...

153
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,909
A cardboard box and this masking tape

154
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,809
on the cut piece of the sheet.

155
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:40,009
No doubt about it!

156
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:42,909
The culprit made use of this space!

157
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:49,309
In order to make Anna's death look as real as possible.

158
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:56,209
Anna!

159
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:01,309
And? How about it, coroner?

160
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:03,909
The death spot is pink.

161
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:08,309
This is unmistakably death from potassium cyanide poisoning.

162
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:10,009
I see.

163
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:14,209
Just in case, I also checked the mask and the tubes

164
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:18,409
that were connected to it when the victim died but...

165
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:21,009
the cause of her death isn't that.

166
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:23,509
You mean it's the capsule that was in her mouth?

167
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:24,809
Yeah.

168
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:27,609
A high concentrate of cyanide response was detected.

169
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:31,309
The scratch on her cheek bothers me a bit but...

170
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:36,309
If there are people who witnessed the deceased suddenly suffering,

171
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,609
there's no other explanation than that she herself,

172
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:42,309
bit the capsule with the poison inside it.

173
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:44,809
After all she was wearing a mask,

174
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:48,909
so nobody could've put the capsule in her mouth.

175
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:51,209
Gosh. If the story about her

176
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:52,509
wanting to experience a near death experience

177
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:56,409
and put something like that in her mouth is true,

178
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:58,509
all decency has been lost.

179
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,209
Can we go home already?

180
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:04,709
After all, it's been concluded that she committed suicide...

181
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,709
rather, that she died of an accident.

182
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:10,909
Yeah. After you go with Officer Takagi to the station

183
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:13,209
and finish interrogation, you may leave.

184
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,109
Where's Officer Takagi?

185
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:16,809
If you're talking about the other officer,

186
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:19,609
a boy wearing glasses called and stopped him.

187
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:21,409
Why?

188
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:24,009
-I have no idea. -Sorry, but...

189
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:26,909
Sonoko suddenly says that she's going to start a deduction show

190
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:30,109
so to gather in the operation room, the scene of the crime.

191
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:36,609
Okay.

192
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:38,609
I've already fired the needle of the tranquilizer gun.

193
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:41,709
The mini mike is also attached to the back of her collar.

194
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:42,809
All I have to do now is use the voice changer

195
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,409
to mimic Sonoko's voice.

196
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:51,309
Just what is the meaning of this?

197
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,009
Sonoko!

198
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:56,909
The cause of Anna's

199
00:10:56,909 --> 00:10:59,109
could be none other than accidental death

200
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:01,809
because she mistakenly bit the poisoned capsule.

201
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:05,509
Therefore, just what and how do you propose to make a deduction?

202
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:09,709
No. As you can tell from the scratch mark on Anna's cheek,

203
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:14,609
someone shoved the poisoned capsule into her mouth

204
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:15,809
and killed her.

205
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:20,509
In other words, before Ran and I came into this operation room,

206
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:23,809
Anna was already poisoned to death.

207
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:27,509
Mutsumi was in the X-Ray room next door.

208
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:29,409
Mr. Tsujiei and Mr. Hachiya

209
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:33,509
who came into this operation room after us.

210
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:36,209
One of the three is the one who did it!

211
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:43,046
Hey, you guys saw

212
00:11:43,046 --> 00:11:45,646
Anna suffer and struggle about, didn't you?

213
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:50,146
Yes, she was having a convulsion.

214
00:11:58,346 --> 00:12:00,646
She was kicking her legs up and down.

215
00:12:00,646 --> 00:12:01,646
If so...

216
00:12:01,646 --> 00:12:03,646
It looked like she was having a convulsion

217
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:06,346
because the bed was shaking and rattling.

218
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:10,146
Then what about her kicking her legs up and down?

219
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,646
The sheet flipped over and her feet were showing, right?

220
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:14,946
Yes.

221
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:16,846
Can't you figure it out?

222
00:12:16,846 --> 00:12:19,446
The bed is handmade, the framework is latticed

223
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,546
and is loosely made, you know?

224
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:25,046
If you're under the bed, don't you think something can be done?

225
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:27,346
Under the bed?

226
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:31,046
I see! The culprit grabbed dead Anna's legs

227
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:32,246
from under the bed sheets and all,

228
00:12:32,246 --> 00:12:33,546
made it look like she was kicking her legs up and down

229
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:37,246
so she looked like she was suffering, no?

230
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:39,446
Like this?

231
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:46,646
Hey! Is someone under the bed?

232
00:12:48,146 --> 00:12:49,546
It's me!

233
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:51,146
Conan?

234
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,346
Just like Sonoko told me to,

235
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:57,246
I stuck both my arms up from under the bed.

236
00:12:57,246 --> 00:12:58,546
How was it?

237
00:12:58,546 --> 00:13:01,846
Well... her legs were kicking up and down faster

238
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:03,946
when we were watching.

239
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:05,446
And, the way it was done now,

240
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:07,446
the sheet underneath would also flip over

241
00:13:07,446 --> 00:13:09,846
so I think it was a bit different.

242
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:14,146
Besides, if the sheet on top of her flipped over more than it should

243
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:17,046
and the culprit's hand that grabbed her legs is in view,

244
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,046
everything would be more than conspicuous.

245
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:23,146
Then, how about this?

246
00:13:30,246 --> 00:13:32,146
Officer Takagi?

247
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:34,146
Officer Takagi is sticking his hands from out

248
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,946
under the bed like Conan did.

249
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:39,346
But the kicking is faster than before

250
00:13:39,346 --> 00:13:42,346
and the sheet underneath isn't flipped over either.

251
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:44,846
No way.

252
00:13:44,846 --> 00:13:47,746
There's no one on the bed and yet how come only the legs are...

253
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:49,846
It can't be, it's impossible.

254
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:53,046
Legs from out under the bed!

255
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:55,346
The legs are showing from the cut part of the sheet?

256
00:13:55,346 --> 00:13:58,146
What on earth is going on anyway?

257
00:13:58,146 --> 00:14:00,046
Ta... Officer Takagi.

258
00:14:00,046 --> 00:14:02,346
Oh, yes, sir.

259
00:14:02,346 --> 00:14:04,946
The trick's easy.

260
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:07,946
First you roll up the sheet up to your knee,

261
00:14:07,946 --> 00:14:11,646
then fold the sheet until it comes to the knee.

262
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:14,046
Pick up the cut piece of sheet that's under the bed

263
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:16,946
and cover the wooden framework of the bed,

264
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:19,646
then fix it in place with masking tape.

265
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:22,046
Pull the switch that ejects blood

266
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:24,646
through the joint part of the sheet

267
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:26,546
and all is set!

268
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:29,146
All that's left to do next, is to stick both your legs out

269
00:14:29,146 --> 00:14:30,846
from the joint part of the sheet.

270
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:32,846
Then do as Officer Takagi did a while ago,

271
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:35,246
kicking his legs up and down

272
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:37,046
and flip the sheet over to show his legs.

273
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:39,846
It would look like Anna is still alive

274
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:42,146
and struggling in pain!

275
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:46,046
If the switch is pushed immediately and blood gushes out.

276
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:48,846
While we were surprised watching this happen,

277
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,346
the culprit quietly took his legs out

278
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:52,846
of the joint part of the sheet,

279
00:14:52,846 --> 00:14:54,246
wore his shoes,

280
00:14:54,246 --> 00:14:57,946
pulled the sheet that he added on under the bed,

281
00:14:57,946 --> 00:14:59,446
removed the masking tape.

282
00:14:59,446 --> 00:15:00,846
Then left from the foot of the bed,

283
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:03,846
which was a blind spot from where we were.

284
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:05,246
In other words, the culprit

285
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:09,246
came to this operation room before we came,

286
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:12,246
forced Anna to drink the poison and killed her.

287
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,146
He then rigged the sheet,

288
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,746
and when we went over to the head of the bed where Anna was,

289
00:15:16,746 --> 00:15:19,146
he shook the bed with both hands.

290
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:21,946
This way, after making it look as if Anna were alive,

291
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:23,446
he snuck out from the bed,

292
00:15:23,446 --> 00:15:27,646
and appeared before us as if nothing had happened!

293
00:15:27,646 --> 00:15:30,346
So, the one capable of doing this

294
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,446
is the one who appeared before us immediately after that.

295
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:37,246
Hey.

296
00:15:37,246 --> 00:15:42,046
It's nothing to get that scared about is there, you two.

297
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:47,146
He's right.

298
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:51,546
All of this is just fake stuff.

299
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:54,246
What? Is something wrong?

300
00:15:55,246 --> 00:16:00,846
I see. So, anyone of you three could've committed the crime.

301
00:16:00,846 --> 00:16:03,146
Hey, I didn't do it!

302
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:04,446
Besides, if it were that way,

303
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:06,246
when her legs are kicked up and down,

304
00:16:06,246 --> 00:16:08,746
the covers on top her would flip over too much

305
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:11,446
and Anna's legs would show, right?

306
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:13,046
Right!

307
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:16,246
If Anna's legs come into view, the trick will be seen through!

308
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:18,446
To avoid this from happening, the culprit...

309
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:24,346
has bent Anna's legs toward the outside.

310
00:16:24,346 --> 00:16:25,746
Don't be ridiculous!

311
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:27,646
That kind of deception will be see right through

312
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:29,246
as soon as the sheet is flipped up.

313
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:32,246
That's why the culprit prepared things beforehand.

314
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:33,746
Right?

315
00:16:33,746 --> 00:16:36,546
Saying that you were taking Anna to the hospital,

316
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:40,146
you put your hand into the bed and carried her up.

317
00:16:40,146 --> 00:16:42,746
I'll take Anna to the hospital.

318
00:16:43,146 --> 00:16:45,346
Mr. Sonsaku Tsujiei?

319
00:16:46,746 --> 00:16:48,846
I see! If he carries her up,

320
00:16:48,846 --> 00:16:52,446
even if her legs were folded in bed, you wouldn't be able to tell.

321
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:53,746
No!

322
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,246
I really thought that Anna fell sick or something and...

323
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:59,046
By the way,

324
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:01,446
is your athlete's foot okay already?

325
00:17:02,346 --> 00:17:05,046
In order to throw the poisoned capsule into Anna's mouth

326
00:17:05,046 --> 00:17:07,146
while she was lying on the bed

327
00:17:07,146 --> 00:17:10,646
and cover her mouth and nose until she swallows it.

328
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:11,846
Since the culprit wasn't able to hold her

329
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:13,346
while the bed was shaking,

330
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:15,446
he stuck his shoe in the space

331
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:17,346
under the upper right leg of the bed

332
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:20,246
so that it wouldn't shake, no?

333
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:23,646
Only, he forgot that there was a pool of blood paint there.

334
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:27,146
Because of this, a red square mark of the leg of the bed

335
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,246
remained on his shoe.

336
00:17:29,246 --> 00:17:30,946
Unfortunately, you realized this,

337
00:17:30,946 --> 00:17:32,846
only after the police arrived.

338
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:35,446
That's why you pretended to have athlete's foot

339
00:17:35,446 --> 00:17:39,846
and rubbed the shoe with the blood paint on it onto the other shoe

340
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:41,846
and tried to get the square trace

341
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:44,246
that was on the shoe to smear off!

342
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:46,446
But, this trick wouldn't have worked

343
00:17:46,446 --> 00:17:49,146
unless we served as guides for you

344
00:17:49,146 --> 00:17:51,446
in this haunted operation room, would it?

345
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,546
Right. We brought you here coincidentally

346
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:56,846
only because Mr. Mouri couldn't come here.

347
00:17:56,846 --> 00:17:58,846
It wasn't a coincidence!

348
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:00,946
Your target was Ran his daughter, to begin with,

349
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:04,646
who you thought would most probably accompany him here.

350
00:18:04,646 --> 00:18:07,746
First, the wisdom bag!

351
00:18:07,746 --> 00:18:12,446
At this rate, who knows when he'll finish talking.

352
00:18:12,446 --> 00:18:14,946
I mean after hearing that a detective was coming,

353
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:17,646
I wanted him to take a look and then.

354
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:21,246
Oh, I'm Kogoro Mouri's daughter.

355
00:18:21,246 --> 00:18:23,146
Did you want to see my father about something?

356
00:18:23,146 --> 00:18:25,246
Could it be that you want him to investigate a case?

357
00:18:25,246 --> 00:18:28,046
No, that's not it but...

358
00:18:28,046 --> 00:18:31,846
If you're his daughter, do you go to investigate cases at times?

359
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:34,546
Yes, at times.

360
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:38,246
Then... you've seen it, haven't you?

361
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:39,446
You deliberately talked about

362
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:43,446
Detective Mouri right beside Ran and brought us here

363
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:46,146
and set us up as eye-witnesses

364
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:48,746
because you figured girls would be terrified. Isn't that right?

365
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:51,146
Serving as an escort would probably come up too,

366
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:52,546
and you could also fake losing sight of us,

367
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:55,746
making it easy for you to prepare to scare us inside the room.

368
00:18:56,046 --> 00:18:59,446
By hiding a surprise device under the bed,

369
00:18:59,446 --> 00:19:03,346
you could put it on right away, and appear too.

370
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:06,246
Nonsense! What proof do you have of this?

371
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:10,746
Then, why not show us your athlete's foot?

372
00:19:10,746 --> 00:19:11,946
Well...

373
00:19:11,946 --> 00:19:14,346
On the back side of the covers,

374
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:17,346
there were several streaks of red lines.

375
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:19,446
That's the trace of your nail

376
00:19:19,446 --> 00:19:22,846
when you slipped your foot inside the bed.

377
00:19:22,846 --> 00:19:25,846
You realized for the first time only after you murdered Anna

378
00:19:25,846 --> 00:19:27,746
and bent her legs toward the outside, right?

379
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:32,546
That she was wearing red pedicure.

380
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:36,646
So, you should still have traces of it on your foot.

381
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:41,146
The red blood paint that you put on your nails to get yourself

382
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,246
out of the predicament!

383
00:19:43,246 --> 00:19:45,446
Excuse me.

384
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:50,446
I see.

385
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:55,546
He slipped his legs into the bed before the pedicure dried

386
00:19:55,546 --> 00:20:00,546
so the blood paint on his nails smeared onto the upper cover.

387
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:04,646
Well, Mutsumi is wearing sandals.

388
00:20:04,646 --> 00:20:08,246
Mr. Hachiya showed us his toes

389
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:12,146
so the only suspect left is you.

390
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:16,546
-Hey, no joke? -Why would you want to kill Anna?

391
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:18,446
You're aware that Anna I

392
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:22,846
used to argue a lot about how to perform being dead, right?

393
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:26,246
She made so much fuss that I asked her.

394
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:31,346
Have you ever seen a person die?

395
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:33,746
Then, she said.

396
00:20:33,746 --> 00:20:35,546
I have!

397
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:37,446
I've seen it over and over for a hundred times,

398
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:39,246
that's why I even see it in my dreams!

399
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:42,046
Just what do you mean by that?

400
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:46,346
I asked Mr. Hashiguchi

401
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:49,646
to shoot everything on video for me

402
00:20:49,646 --> 00:20:54,046
if he was planning to kill himself anyway!

403
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:55,646
No...

404
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:57,846
No joke?

405
00:20:57,846 --> 00:21:00,546
When we found the body of Hashiguchi in his room,

406
00:21:00,546 --> 00:21:03,446
Anna was acting strange, wasn't she?

407
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:05,246
She was really excited saying things like,

408
00:21:05,246 --> 00:21:07,146
"Call the police,"

409
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:10,346
Or, "Search the room because his last will must be somewhere".

410
00:21:10,346 --> 00:21:12,646
Then, don't tell me that she...

411
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,046
Yeah.

412
00:21:14,046 --> 00:21:17,246
She said she took the tape out of the video camera

413
00:21:17,246 --> 00:21:20,646
that was hidden inside the bookshelf at that time.

414
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,546
That's why, I made her go through

415
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:25,746
the same thing that Hashiguchi did!

416
00:21:25,746 --> 00:21:28,146
I told her that the black paint she had on her teeth

417
00:21:28,146 --> 00:21:30,946
was wearing off so that I'd fix it for her.

418
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:33,446
I cracked the capsule with my mouth

419
00:21:33,446 --> 00:21:38,346
and threw the capsule into her mouth!

420
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:43,346
Rather than try to stop him from committing suicide,

421
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:45,246
she had the nerve to urge him on.

422
00:21:45,246 --> 00:21:46,646
Even if he only had six more months to live

423
00:21:46,646 --> 00:21:48,446
because of his illness,

424
00:21:48,446 --> 00:21:50,546
with six more months to go,

425
00:21:50,546 --> 00:21:54,046
we could've maybe completed our graduation project movie.

426
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,846
Anw we may have been able to show it to him...

427
00:21:57,846 --> 00:22:02,546
And yet... and yet she had the nerve to...

428
00:23:31,746 --> 00:23:36,946
Well... but Pops never came, after all.

429
00:23:36,946 --> 00:23:40,746
Okay, bag 104 is what everybody has.

430
00:23:40,746 --> 00:23:42,446
A bag stored with patience!

431
00:23:42,446 --> 00:23:43,846
If this bag of stored patience bursts,

432
00:23:43,846 --> 00:23:45,746
I can't continue on with the detective business.

433
00:23:45,746 --> 00:23:50,046
-I don't believe it. -He's still lecturing.

434
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:52,346
Talk about too long...
