1
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:09,555
Happy New Year!

2
00:00:09,555 --> 00:00:12,455
Did you enjoy your New Year Holiday?

3
00:00:12,455 --> 00:00:14,555
Did you receive a lot of "otoshidama" (New Year's monetary gift)?

4
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:15,755
I hope you didn't over eat New Year's dishes

5
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:17,855
and get a stomachache.

6
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:20,255
Thanks to all of you rooting for us,

7
00:00:20,255 --> 00:00:21,855
the "Detective Conan Series"

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,755
has successfully entered its 18th year of broadcast!

9
00:00:24,755 --> 00:00:29,355
We'll actively keep solving one case after the other this year too...

10
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:31,855
Along with the members of the Youth Detective Squad...

11
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:34,555
Please keep rooting for the Detective Conan Series...

12
00:00:34,555 --> 00:00:37,955
As you have thus far...

13
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:43,055
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

14
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:45,155
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

15
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:46,855
The curtains are raised after 18 years.

16
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:48,855
Is it a love story of two police officers?

17
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:50,555
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:52,455
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:55,355
His name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:41,151
"A Life Risking Love Broadcast (Start of the Broadcast)"

21
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:57,851
Hey, you detective over there!

22
00:02:57,851 --> 00:02:59,451
Yumi.

23
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:00,651
Are you staking out from now?

24
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:04,151
No, I finished work early today.

25
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,051
I have some place I have to go now.

26
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:10,051
Well, I'll come back after just a one night's stay.

27
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:11,651
Oh, what's that about?

28
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:15,551
Are you going on a hot spring date with Miwako or what?

29
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:17,251
No.

30
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:20,251
It's not a date.

31
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:23,751
No way. Miwako, even you don't know

32
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:25,351
where Officer Takagi is going?

33
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:27,451
Yes, it seems that he told Inspector Megure

34
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:31,551
that he had to relay something to somebody.

35
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:34,951
Maybe it's your parents or something?

36
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:37,351
Maybe he's going to tell them, "Please let me marry your daughter".

37
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:38,951
Now, look here.

38
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:41,951
If that's the case, why did he have to keep it a secret from me?

39
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:44,051
Besides, my mother lives in Tokyo,

40
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:46,551
so there's no need for him to spend the night over.

41
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:49,351
By the way, who are you?

42
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:51,251
I'm Naeko Miike who was transferred over

43
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:54,451
from the Haido Police Office.

44
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:57,451
-Is that right? -But I'm sure

45
00:03:57,451 --> 00:03:59,251
that Inspector Megure already knows who that person is.

46
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:01,851
It seems like he really hasn't told him anything yet.

47
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:03,451
He only told him, "I'll tell you about it, after I return

48
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,051
and my feelings are settled."

49
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:07,951
Something smells fishy.

50
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:09,351
Right? Don't you think so?

51
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:12,151
Well, I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with love or things like that.

52
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:15,151
He clearly said that he wasn't going on a date, after all.

53
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:16,651
Geez.

54
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:19,051
I wonder if he really remembers

55
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,051
Mr. Date's memorial day?

56
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:24,351
Come to think of it, it has been almost a year.

57
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:27,751
He told me that he'd go pay a visit to his grave with me, and yet...

58
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:29,751
Who are you talking about?

59
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:32,351
The police detective that used to be Officer Takagi's mentor.

60
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:35,751
He was a tough guy that you couldn't kill even if you wanted to.

61
00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:39,451
And yet, he was involved in a traffic accident and died just like that.

62
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:41,651
Then maybe he had something he wanted to report

63
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:44,251
to the parents of the detective?

64
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:47,751
No, Mr. Date's parents also live in Tokyo.

65
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:51,351
If so, maybe it has to do with a woman or something after all.

66
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:53,451
Come to think of it, Officer Takagi

67
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:56,451
is quite popular in the transportation department.

68
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:00,751
Well, he's not as popular as Miwako though.

69
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:02,851
That Takagi...

70
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:09,351
Darn it, maybe I caught a cold.

71
00:05:10,951 --> 00:05:14,151
Procedures shall begin for passengers

72
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:17,251
who are boarding Luna Airlines flight number 299 for Tottori

73
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:21,051
departing at 19:35.

74
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:22,851
Those who are boarding the plane,

75
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:25,751
"Meet with parents" -please go to boarding gate number 18.

76
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:39,551
Officer Sato, I...

77
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:47,051
I'm losing confidence that I can make you happy.

78
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:50,051
We, the members of the Youth Detective Squad

79
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:51,751
finally did it, didn't we?

80
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,451
"Police Station" -What an honor to be selected as models

81
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:55,651
for the children crime prevention pamphlet!

82
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:58,751
Yeah! We did solve a lot of crimes after all!

83
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:02,551
What should we do? We're going to be famous!

84
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:05,051
But I wonder if Doc's okay.

85
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:08,651
He said he'd come right after parking his car in the parking lot.

86
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:11,451
He was really coughing up a storm, so...

87
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,851
I wonder if he has a cold?

88
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:15,851
Officer Takagi is late, too.

89
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:19,151
He told me to call him when we get to the MPD,

90
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:21,251
so that he could take us over to the PR section in charge.

91
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:23,151
But I can't get through to him at all.

92
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:27,251
Maybe he's caught up in a lovey-dovey situation again?

93
00:06:27,251 --> 00:06:29,851
Maybe he's having a kiss like he did back then.

94
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:32,351
Even Officer Takagi wouldn't do something like that

95
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,851
during working hours!

96
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,151
That's right!

97
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:36,651
Excuse me.

98
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:39,851
Do you know Officer Wataru Takagi, children?

99
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:41,751
What?

100
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:43,851
Yes, we do. But why?

101
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:45,851
I couldn't have asked for better.

102
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:50,951
He asked me to hand this over to his detective girlfriend.

103
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:54,251
Could you do so for me?

104
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:58,551
Are you referring to Officer Sato whom we were just talking about?

105
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,551
Do you mean you also know that female detective?

106
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:02,551
Yes.

107
00:07:02,551 --> 00:07:05,351
She's strong and scary like an ogre though.

108
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:06,551
Well, well...

109
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,251
But she's very pretty, too!

110
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:10,251
That's right!

111
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:13,151
I'm sure they're getting married soon!

112
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,051
-Right! -They're really in love, you see!

113
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:21,051
Then, please relay this message from him to the happy female detective.

114
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:25,551
He said that it's perishable, so open it as soon as you can.

115
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:27,551
He also said that it will be no good

116
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:31,351
by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

117
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,251
Hey!

118
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,651
Conan!

119
00:07:35,651 --> 00:07:38,551
Okay, I'm counting on you guys.

120
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:40,251
Who is that guy?

121
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,851
He seems to be an acquaintance of Officer Takagi.

122
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:45,151
By the way, where are Doc and Ai?

123
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,551
It seems that Doc has a cold after all.

124
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,651
I asked him to go home with Ai.

125
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:51,351
What?

126
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:53,451
Well, Doc's acting sick

127
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:57,651
because he can't allow Ai's picture to be put on the pamphlet.

128
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,551
So, does that mean Ai's not going to appear on it?

129
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:00,751
That's too bad.

130
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:03,651
I'm disappointed, too.

131
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:07,951
I thought that I'd get to see the much rumored Dr. Agasa.

132
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:09,651
Mr. Amuro.

133
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:11,851
I heard from Master Mouri

134
00:08:11,851 --> 00:08:14,151
that the members of the Youth Detective Squad

135
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:16,251
would be coming over to the MPD on Dr. Agasa's car today

136
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:19,851
to take pictures to be put on the pamphlet.

137
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:23,351
I was told to come to the MPD, too.

138
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:25,351
I've already finished what I had to do though.

139
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:26,751
Why were you told to come here?

140
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:29,951
It was about the case back when you were kidnapped,

141
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,651
and I stopped the car that you were in by crashing into it.

142
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:35,751
They were questioning me again,

143
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:38,251
saying that I might have gone overboard.

144
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,651
Come to think of it,

145
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:43,451
Masumi also said that she was told to come to the MPD again.

146
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:47,451
In her case, she absolutely went overboard.

147
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:49,451
Well, I also came here

148
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:51,751
because I had something else to do.

149
00:08:51,751 --> 00:08:53,251
Something else to do?

150
00:08:53,251 --> 00:08:55,751
Don't worry about it.

151
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:58,851
Because I don't have to do it anymore.

152
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:00,651
Conan.

153
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:02,751
Who was the young man?

154
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:06,051
He's the private detective who became Pop Kogoro's disciple.

155
00:09:06,051 --> 00:09:08,551
A detective?

156
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:10,751
He's good-looking.

157
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:13,351
By the way, isn't Officer Takagi here yet?

158
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,751
It seems like he's forgotten.

159
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:17,951
I can't get through to him either.

160
00:09:17,951 --> 00:09:21,251
Then, why don't we try calling Officer Chiba?

161
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:22,751
If so...

162
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:24,651
Let's call Officer Sato!

163
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:27,351
Since this is perishable.

164
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:30,751
What?

165
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:33,051
Officer Takagi was in tears while looking at the mini photo

166
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:34,951
he had attached on his memo pad?

167
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:36,051
Yes, ma'am.

168
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:39,151
It looked like a cute photo at first glance,

169
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:42,251
so I asked him if that photo was of you, Officer Sato.

170
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:43,751
Cut the joke!

171
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,451
And he got really angry at me.

172
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:48,151
"Cut the joke"?

173
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:50,051
He told me not to say anything

174
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:52,351
because he wanted to explain it himself.

175
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:55,751
Hey! Where is Officer Takagi?

176
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:59,051
I wonder, too. I haven't seen him yet today.

177
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:07,151
Yes, hello.

178
00:10:07,151 --> 00:10:08,351
Conan?

179
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:12,751
Officer Takagi has something for me?

180
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:15,251
Did the unknown man say that to you?

181
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:17,651
-Yeah. -Here it is!

182
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,451
What is going on here?

183
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,051
He hasn't even shown up at work yet.

184
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:23,351
Officer Takagi isn't here yet?

185
00:10:23,351 --> 00:10:25,751
That man told us that it's perishable,

186
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,751
so he told us to eat it by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

187
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:31,451
But this tablet doesn't look edible.

188
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:33,251
It's a tablet.

189
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:36,251
It could be a video letter, then.

190
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:39,051
I'm sure he was too embarrassed to tell you in person.

191
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:42,251
Officer Takagi is shy, you see.

192
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:44,751
Seriously. If you have something to tell me,

193
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:46,851
why can't you say it directly to me?

194
00:10:49,151 --> 00:10:51,151
O... Officer Takagi!

195
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,251
There's a rope tied around his neck!

196
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:54,851
If so, he can't get away.

197
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:58,651
But if he's just tied up and lying down...

198
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:00,751
-It switched. -Yes.

199
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:02,651
It's taken from a different camera angle.

200
00:11:02,651 --> 00:11:04,151
Wait... Wait a second!

201
00:11:04,151 --> 00:11:06,051
If he turns over and falls...

202
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:08,451
He'll be strangled and get killed!

203
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:09,851
Get up, Officer Takagi!

204
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:12,051
Get up and get a hold of your circumstances!

205
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:18,251
Officer Takagi.

206
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:22,651
Where...

207
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,255
Where is this place?

208
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,721
Calm down. Calm down.

209
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,921
Think. Try to recall

210
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:34,821
how things turned out this way.

211
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:37,721
If I remember correctly, I met with that person last night,

212
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:39,721
and was told that he wanted to show me some scenery,

213
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:42,021
so he brought me here.

214
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:45,421
Then, I was suddenly drugged from behind.

215
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:47,921
But why?

216
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:50,821
Don't tell me that he wanted to...

217
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:53,321
Which means that the image on this camera

218
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:55,521
is being sent to the MPD.

219
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:56,921
What?

220
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:59,821
Officer Takagi was kidnapped by someone?

221
00:11:59,821 --> 00:12:03,121
Yes, sir! This is the image of him.

222
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:05,521
Officer Takagi!

223
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:07,621
The camera switched over?

224
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:09,521
There are probably three cameras.

225
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:13,521
The shots are taken from the front, the side, and below.

226
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:15,621
They seem to be streamed randomly.

227
00:12:15,621 --> 00:12:18,021
Can you tell where the images are being sent from?

228
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:21,721
Yes, if we let the cyber crime department handle this.

229
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:25,021
I don't think anything can be done right away.

230
00:12:25,021 --> 00:12:26,421
Conan!

231
00:12:26,421 --> 00:12:29,221
The only thing that can be done with that tablet

232
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:30,421
is to switch the image on and off

233
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:33,321
by pressing the button on the front of it.

234
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:34,921
It's made so that everything else including the touch panel,

235
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:39,921
power switch and the connector to charge it cannot be used.

236
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:41,721
But Conan.

237
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:43,821
If we disassemble this tablet,

238
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:46,421
it can be charged directly from the inside.

239
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:49,121
The data can also be transferred from the hard disk.

240
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:51,121
Wouldn't we at least be able to figure out

241
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:52,621
where the information is being sent from?

242
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:54,021
What if we aren't able

243
00:12:54,021 --> 00:12:58,221
to view Officer Takagi's footage after we disassembled it?

244
00:12:58,221 --> 00:13:00,421
The culprit has remodeled the button,

245
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:03,621
and embedded a program to invalidate the functions

246
00:13:03,621 --> 00:13:05,121
of the touch panel and all, you know?

247
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:07,321
So, it'd be safer to think that this device is rigged

248
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,721
so that the image would be cut off,

249
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,621
and will never boot again if it is disassembled.

250
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:13,821
Well, we could contact the provider

251
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:19,121
and trace the tablet without having to go through something so risky.

252
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:20,621
But culprits that carry out something like this

253
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:23,721
would most likely be using a server abroad,

254
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:25,921
so I think it would be difficult to trace the origin of the transmission

255
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:28,121
in a short time.

256
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:32,621
That's what Shinichi told me when I discussed this over the phone

257
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:34,221
with him a while ago.

258
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:36,321
But if it's possible to trace it,

259
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:38,821
even if we have to spend some time...

260
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:42,021
But the time limit is tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, right?

261
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,721
Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?

262
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:48,421
The man who gave the tablet to Genta and the others said so.

263
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:51,221
He told them that it's perishable, so it should be opened quickly.

264
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:54,621
Otherwise, it'll become no good tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

265
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:56,621
What... What on earth does that mean?

266
00:13:56,621 --> 00:14:01,121
It probably means that if he's left as is, tied up and all...

267
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:03,821
Without water or food, he won't make it past the third day.

268
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:07,321
In other words, we only have until the day after tomorrow.

269
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:11,921
But why does Officer Takagi have to go through something like this?

270
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:15,821
He's not the type that would be hated by people.

271
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,621
Being hated is an inevitable trait of any police detective.

272
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:21,221
You'd never know when and where someone would hold a grudge against you.

273
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:23,721
Superintendent Matsumoto!

274
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:26,921
Megure, is it true that Officer Takagi said

275
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:29,821
that he'd be staying overnight somewhere to meet someone?

276
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:30,821
Yes, sir.

277
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:33,121
He was concerned about the timetable of the monorail,

278
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:35,521
so he probably went to Haneda Airport.

279
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:39,021
Then, contact Haneda Airport and find out if there was anyone

280
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:41,821
by the name of Wataru Takagi among last night's passengers.

281
00:14:41,821 --> 00:14:43,421
Yes, sir!

282
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:46,721
Shiratori, go to Takagi's residence,

283
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:49,321
check the mails on his computer and his mailbox

284
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,021
and figure out who he was planning to see.

285
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:55,521
-Yes, sir. -Chiba, keep watch over the tablet.

286
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,221
-Yes, sir! -Don't keep it on for too long.

287
00:14:58,221 --> 00:15:00,221
If we can't charge it,

288
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:01,721
it means we can only watch the image

289
00:15:01,721 --> 00:15:03,321
for less than 10 hours.

290
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:05,521
Turn it on for only 10 minutes per hour,

291
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:08,621
then record the video while you're checking it.

292
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:11,921
We have to find something to identify his location.

293
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:14,621
Yes... Yes, sir! I'll get to it right away!

294
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:16,921
Superintendent.

295
00:15:16,921 --> 00:15:20,921
-What about... -Sato, go and question the children

296
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,121
who are waiting in the other room.

297
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,521
Yes, sir!

298
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:25,421
After all, they're vital witnesses

299
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:27,721
who were in contact with the suspect.

300
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:29,721
Ask them what the suspect looked like,

301
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,321
his habits and also his usage of words.

302
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:33,121
Don't leave out anything!

303
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:34,421
Yes, sir.

304
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:38,721
Everyone else, go and find all the people whom Takagi came across

305
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:40,521
during his investigations.

306
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:43,421
Whether it's the suspects or victims, find everybody, understand?

307
00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:44,721
Yes, sir...

308
00:15:49,621 --> 00:15:52,421
Officer Sato, let's go.

309
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,121
No matter what, I give you my word that I'll rescue you.

310
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:01,621
Hang on, Officer Takagi!

311
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:12,021
I see. So that's the story.

312
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:14,721
That's why that person brought me to a place like this.

313
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:17,321
If that's the case, even if it's scary,

314
00:16:17,321 --> 00:16:19,221
I've got no choice but to do it.

315
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:25,721
Then, let me confirm once again.

316
00:16:25,721 --> 00:16:27,521
A man who looked like this

317
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:29,921
handed that tablet to you?

318
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:31,021
Yeah.

319
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:34,421
First, he asked us if we knew Officer Wataru Takagi.

320
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:36,421
We replied that we do.

321
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:39,021
Then, he told us to give it

322
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:41,421
to Officer Takagi's girlfriend.

323
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:44,821
Then, it could be someone who holds a grudge against me, too.

324
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:47,321
I don't think so.

325
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:50,621
The culprit seems to know Officer Takagi by his first name,

326
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:55,321
and yet he only knows you as Officer Takagi's girlfriend.

327
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:57,321
Then, was there anything about his habits

328
00:16:57,321 --> 00:16:59,021
or usage of words that bothered you?

329
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:01,221
There wasn't anything unusual, right?

330
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,521
-Yeah. -Yeah.

331
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,121
Bad news, Officer Sato!

332
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:06,221
Officer Takagi...

333
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:10,521
Officer Sato!

334
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:19,121
Officer Takagi. Officer Takagi!

335
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:24,521
What's this situation all about?

336
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:26,521
Why does it look as if he's about to fall?

337
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:29,421
I was trying to record the third image we received today,

338
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:31,821
and then I saw this.

339
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:33,321
But why?

340
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:36,421
He has been like this for many hours already.

341
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:39,021
It's understandable that he'd surrender to despair.

342
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:41,821
Get a hold of yourself! Officer Takagi...

343
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:51,121
His police memo book.

344
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:55,021
Hey, if somebody picks that up and reports it to the police,

345
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:58,321
we'll be able to figure out where Officer Takagi is.

346
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:02,921
It's okay. It seems like Officer Takagi's in control.

347
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:04,821
You... You're right.

348
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:14,221
Hey! What on earth's going on?

349
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:17,621
Wataru Takagi's wasn't on any flight

350
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:19,921
departing from Haneda last night.

351
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:22,721
No clues were found in Takagi's residence either,

352
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:24,221
and there are no cases

353
00:18:24,221 --> 00:18:26,821
that seem related to what's happening now.

354
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:30,421
Well...

355
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:31,921
What is it?

356
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:33,521
Come to think of it,

357
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:36,421
I happened to see Takagi coming out from the reference room last week.

358
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:37,521
What?

359
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:40,021
The thing is, he was in tears.

360
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:44,221
So I wondered what documents he was looking through.

361
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:45,421
Okay.

362
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:48,821
Bring all those documents before me!

363
00:18:48,821 --> 00:18:49,821
Yes, sir...

364
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:54,821
All the case documents that Officer Takagi was looking through that day

365
00:18:54,821 --> 00:18:56,321
involved cases of women

366
00:18:56,321 --> 00:18:59,721
who hung themselves to death about a year ago?

367
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,321
Yes.

368
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:02,921
There are three cases in total.

369
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:04,921
They were all concluded as non-criminal cases,

370
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:07,421
and were handed over to the district police station.

371
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:10,521
What were the three cases like?

372
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:13,721
If I remember correctly, one of them was Ms. Yuko Takugi,

373
00:19:13,721 --> 00:19:16,621
a sixth-year medical student at Tohto University.

374
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:18,221
The place where she committed suicide

375
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:19,821
was the living room of her condo.

376
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:21,821
It didn't look much like a woman's room,

377
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:24,021
but it was neat and tidy.

378
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:26,421
Based on the will that was found near her feet,

379
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:30,321
it is written that she ran over somebody a few days before that,

380
00:19:30,321 --> 00:19:34,121
and she couldn't bear the guilt any longer.

381
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:37,321
The second one was a teacher at an English conversation school,

382
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:40,821
whose mother was American. Her name was Ms. Natalie Kuruma.

383
00:19:40,821 --> 00:19:44,321
Based on what was written on the calendar in her room,

384
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:47,621
she had been dating her boyfriend every day.

385
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:51,321
But after being dumped by him, she seemed to have fallen to despair.

386
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:52,621
She seemed to have planned a date with him

387
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:55,321
the day she committed suicide.

388
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:58,221
How could you tell that?

389
00:19:58,221 --> 00:20:00,321
From her cell phone.

390
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:03,721
The dispatched police squad that got there before us

391
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:05,421
told us that it was written in the English text mail

392
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:07,421
that she sent to her mother.

393
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:10,421
The third woman was Ms. Kyoka Hikoue,

394
00:20:10,421 --> 00:20:13,621
the number-one hostess at a bar in Roppongi.

395
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:15,521
It seems she was making a lot of money and yet,

396
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:17,421
she lived in an old apartment.

397
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:20,321
Her room was filled with empty beer cans.

398
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:22,621
According to her diary, she found out that the boyfriend

399
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,521
she was helping out financially was a marriage swindler.

400
00:20:24,521 --> 00:20:26,821
So, she hung herself to death in despair.

401
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:28,921
Was that swindler arrested?

402
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:32,721
Yes, not under the charge of swindling, but murder.

403
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:35,821
He seems to have been swarmed with debts

404
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:37,321
and got into trouble with black market loan sharks,

405
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,621
and ended up stabbing someone.

406
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:42,421
If I remember correctly, it was Officer Date who arrested him.

407
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:43,721
Officer Date?

408
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:47,021
Right. You've never met him, haven't you, Conan?

409
00:20:47,021 --> 00:20:50,521
Officer Date died in a traffic accident

410
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:53,721
immediately after he arrested that swindler.

411
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:56,821
Officer Date was trying to pick up a memo book,

412
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:59,421
when a driver who fell asleep at the wheels ran over him.

413
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:01,421
That's what Officer Takagi said.

414
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:03,821
-Officer Takagi said so? -Yes.

415
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:06,921
Officer Takagi was at the scene, too.

416
00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:08,621
They were staking out all night

417
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:10,921
and were on their way home in the morning.

418
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:14,121
I heard that he was run over when he tried to show Officer Takagi

419
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:15,621
something in the memo book.

420
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:19,421
You know, the black memo book that Officer Takagi is always using.

421
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:22,621
It's a keepsake of Officer Date that was handed over to him.

422
00:21:22,621 --> 00:21:25,121
He worked hard to fill it up until there was no space to write in it.

423
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:27,921
And he used to say with enthusiasm that he wanted to become

424
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:30,421
a police detective like Officer Date soon.

425
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:33,621
Officer Takagi and the other officer got along well, didn't they?

426
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:34,621
Yes.

427
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:38,321
Officer Date was Officer Takagi's mentor.

428
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:42,021
Officer Date used to call the two of them "The Wataru Brothers".

429
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:43,821
Why were they called "Brothers"?

430
00:21:43,821 --> 00:21:47,821
Because Officer Date's full name was Wataru Date.

431
00:21:47,821 --> 00:21:51,621
His first name was Wataru, the same as Officer Takagi's.

432
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:54,121
Well, they both had the name, "Wataru",

433
00:21:54,121 --> 00:21:56,421
but unlike Officer Takagi who wasn't very into women,

434
00:21:56,421 --> 00:21:58,721
Officer Date loved to pursue them.

435
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:00,821
Although he was only a year older than me,

436
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:03,321
Officer Date looked much older.

437
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:05,121
Don't tell me that...

438
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:08,821
Don't tell me that the reason Officer Takagi was kidnapped was...

439
00:23:54,221 --> 00:23:56,621
Is... Is this an earthquake?

440
00:23:56,621 --> 00:23:58,021
Is it abroad?

441
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,721
Get a hold of yourself.

442
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:02,321
I've got to get out of here somehow.

443
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:05,021
I have to relay the message to that person!

444
00:24:05,021 --> 00:24:07,121
Was there anyone who was related to Hokkaido

445
00:24:07,121 --> 00:24:09,721
among the three women who committed suicide?

446
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:11,321
Tell me where Officer Takagi is.

447
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:14,621
Are you the one?

448
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,721
He was run over by a car and passed away that day!

449
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:23,421
