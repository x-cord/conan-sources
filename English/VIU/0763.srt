1
00:00:33,938 --> 00:00:35,608
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

2
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:37,568
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

3
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:39,398
Deciphering codes together with Heiji.

4
00:00:39,518 --> 00:00:41,328
Tokyo-Osaka large scale mystery solving.

5
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:42,970
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,768
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:44,888 --> 00:00:47,278
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:30,786
"Conan and Heiji, Code of Love (Part 1)"

9
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:39,141
Bummers, this rain sucks.

10
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:42,101
Just when we were thinking of playing soccer in the park.

11
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,591
But it started raining the minute we got there.

12
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:49,471
But there was 50% chance of rain,

13
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:51,981
so we did right to bring umbrellas.

14
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:54,991
Why don't we play games at Doc's house then?

15
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:57,041
Yeah! Let's!

16
00:02:57,161 --> 00:03:00,951
Speaking of games, how far did you get in "Titan Hunter"?

17
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:02,701
I got to rank 7.

18
00:03:02,821 --> 00:03:05,001
I got the Haoken!

19
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:06,361
No joke?

20
00:03:06,481 --> 00:03:08,381
-Really? -Yep!

21
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:15,811
-And? What did you want to talk to me about? -Oh, right.

22
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:18,131
Do you understand...

23
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:21,391
what "Younger sister from another domain" means?

24
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,691
What?

25
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:27,521
Is that a setting for a late night anime or something?

26
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:28,851
No.

27
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:32,837
Masumi seems to be hiding an intermediate school aged girl,

28
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,434
who looks just like her at her hotel.

29
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:41,701
It bothered me so much that I texted her about the girl yesterday.

30
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:46,201
She texted back, "She's my younger sister from another domain."

31
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:48,881
Then, she's her younger sister, no?

32
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:52,501
But she said she had no younger sister.

33
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:54,931
And what does "from another domain mean?

34
00:03:56,131 --> 00:04:01,471
Besides, I feel like I've met her somewhere before.

35
00:04:03,051 --> 00:04:05,821
I guess you'll have to start from remembering where it was.

36
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:10,941
I was thinking the same thing. But all I remember is her snaggletooth...

37
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:15,981
Ouch...

38
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:19,201
You brat! Watch it!

39
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:21,871
What's this?

40
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:23,711
Tea leaves?

41
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:24,831
Don't touch it!

42
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:27,121
There he is!

43
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,501
Hold it!

44
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,311
Who are those men?

45
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:40,971
-Probably cops. -What?

46
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:44,551
Judging from his appearance,

47
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,011
the one they were chasing is probably a drug dealer.

48
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:51,281
The tea leaves like stuff that you picked up is dried weed.

49
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:53,561
Probably marijuana.

50
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:55,021
What?

51
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:57,171
Marijuana?

52
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:01,221
Oh, no! I touched that bag, you know?

53
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:03,451
Maybe your fingerprints got on it.

54
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:06,811
Your fingerprints on the bag is no big deal!

55
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,331
-You sure? -Yeah.

56
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:12,381
If you explain what happened to the police...

57
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:14,951
A pocketbook?

58
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:20,261
That man must've dropped it.

59
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:21,461
Yeah.

60
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:29,201
But nothing seems to be written inside.

61
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:33,061
No. There's something small written on the edge of the page.

62
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:36,301
There's an "E" and "2" and a "circled 2".

63
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,221
The character "ma" for drugs.

64
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:40,071
Drugs?

65
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:43,591
Something else seems to be written after the "ma",

66
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:46,377
but unlike the letters and numbers on the side,

67
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:48,353
it's written in water-based ink,

68
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:51,331
so it's smeared by rainwater.

69
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:55,281
There's something written on the next page, too!

70
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:57,691
Yeah. On the next

71
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:01,341
and the next page, too.

72
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,291
A total of 12 lines.

73
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,483
All that can be barely read of the blurred words are...

74
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:09,551
"ma" on the 1st line,

75
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:11,801
"tsuki" on the 3rd line, "nihon" on the 5th line,

76
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:13,351
and "kyobashi" on the 9th line.

77
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:15,591
I wonder what they are?

78
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:17,591
Codes, right?

79
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:23,241
Maybe they're code numbers for members of a drug smuggling organization!

80
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:27,241
Like E22 and S10.

81
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,731
What about the circles?

82
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:32,621
And "tsuki" and "nihon" written after that?

83
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,261
And? Did you figure it out?

84
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:36,901
I don't have the slightest idea.

85
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,441
No use hanging on to it, so let's take it to the police box.

86
00:06:41,431 --> 00:06:43,401
-You're right. -Yeah.

87
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:44,631
Yeah.

88
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,641
See you officer!

89
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:50,011
We're counting on you!

90
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:52,141
-Thank you! -Not at all.

91
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:54,971
What now?

92
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:57,331
It stopped raining.

93
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:00,531
Shall we go back to the park to play soccer?

94
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:02,421
Sorry.

95
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,241
I just remembered I had something to do so I'm going home!

96
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:07,041
Okay!

97
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,301
Bye!

98
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:09,911
See you later!

99
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:17,491
Conan's a crummy liar.

100
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:19,591
It's so obvious!

101
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:22,801
We've learned over time.

102
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:24,591
So...

103
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,831
Ai, let us use the you know what!

104
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:28,301
Please!

105
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:29,551
Yes, yes.

106
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:38,481
Well, I got here.

107
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:41,111
But there's nobody here.

108
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:45,161
Just as I thought, it's no good unless I know what time.

109
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:52,971
The only ones here are the kids...

110
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:56,751
who secretly came after me.

111
00:07:57,241 --> 00:07:58,931
Oh, what a coincidence.

112
00:07:59,051 --> 00:08:01,841
Do you have business this way, too?

113
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:04,101
Coincidence my foot!

114
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:07,982
You followed the location of my detective badge

115
00:08:08,105 --> 00:08:09,506
using those spare tracking glasses!

116
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:10,841
Because...

117
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:12,801
No fair!

118
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:15,671
You're investigating something, right?

119
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:19,521
Yeah. The stuff that's written in this pocketbook

120
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:23,651
is probably the place, dates and time of various drug deals.

121
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:27,671
Drug deals?

122
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:34,455
Drug deals?

123
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:37,455
How do you know?

124
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:40,665
The clues are the notes written in water-based ink

125
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:43,175
next to the letters and figures.

126
00:08:43,725 --> 00:08:46,069
The finger of the drug dealer was soiled

127
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:49,495
with the same color ink as the smeared letters.

128
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:52,685
So the letters were written by the drug dealer.

129
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:55,987
If so, the codes written by permanent marker

130
00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:57,835
were written by someone else.

131
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,935
It's only natural to think that the other party wrote it, right?

132
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:07,315
The other party probably sent the drug dealer a pocketbook

133
00:09:07,435 --> 00:09:10,435
of codes designating the places, dates and time of the deals.

134
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:14,035
He taught only the drug dealer how to decipher the codes,

135
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:17,205
so no one else could figure it out even if they saw the pocketbook.

136
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:21,165
What about the letters in water-based written by that man?

137
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:25,985
Yeah. He wrote the answers to the codes next to it!

138
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:29,095
He was probably planning to burn or trash them later.

139
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:31,645
In other words, E22 to "ma",

140
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:37,165
Y21 to "tsuki", G11 to "nihon". Each symbolizes a Chinese character.

141
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:41,585
With these clues, you can tell right off

142
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:44,005
that they are subway routes and station numbers!

143
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,205
What?

144
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:51,935
So, E22 refers to the 22nd station on the Oedo Line, Azabu Juban.

145
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:57,245
Y21 refers to the 21st station on the Yurakucho Line, Tsukishima.

146
00:09:57,395 --> 00:10:01,945
G11 refers to the 11th station on the Ginza Line, Nihonbashi.

147
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,945
Station numbers?

148
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:05,705
What's that?

149
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:07,430
Well, let me tell you.

150
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,975
They're the circled letters and numbers

151
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:14,975
displayed next to the name of the station.

152
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,835
Really?

153
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:19,375
Which means, you only remove the circled number

154
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:22,855
or letter of the station and read it?

155
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:27,223
Since in E22 of Azabu Juban, the 3rd number is circled,

156
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:30,625
so the 3rd kanji character "ju" is chosen.

157
00:10:31,155 --> 00:10:37,545
Using this rule, if you read up to the 5th line of the code, E22 is "ju"!

158
00:10:37,665 --> 00:10:41,002
C10 is Nijubashimae on the Chiyoda Line,

159
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:43,279
the 1st letter is circled so it's "Ni"!

160
00:10:43,535 --> 00:10:47,498
Y21 is Tsukishima on the Yurakucho Line, so it's "tsuki"!

161
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:51,821
M09 is Shinjuku Sanchome on the Marunouchi Line, so it's "san"!

162
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:55,593
G11 is Nihonbashi on the Ginza Line, so it's "Nichi"!

163
00:10:55,715 --> 00:10:58,986
If you line everything up, it comes out "December 3rd"!

164
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:03,775
Hey! Isn't today December 3rd?

165
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:07,895
Yeah. So the deal's supposed to be today.

166
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:12,405
I can't solve the lines below the date from the 6th line!

167
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:16,325
The dates, location and time should be written, but...

168
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:19,985
Since in N11 of Korakuen on the Namboku Line, shown on the 6th line,

169
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:22,295
the 2nd number is circled, so the 2nd kanji character "raku" is chosen.

170
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:26,685
In Y12 is Edogawabashi on the Yurakucho Line. Shown on the 7th line,

171
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:29,335
since the 2nd number is also circled here, "do" is chosen.

172
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,115
It reads, "Rakudo".

173
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,735
It's totally Greek to me.

174
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:39,705
If so, why did we come here?

175
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:44,050
Since HO2 on the 8th line, is Ebisu on the Hibiya Line,

176
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:47,675
and there's a circle around it entirely, it's chose as is.

177
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:51,645
Since on the side of N22, there is a written note "Kyobashi",

178
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:55,099
and the 2nd number is circled, "bashi" is chosen.

179
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:59,245
In other words, "Ebisubashi".

180
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:04,605
That's why I took a guess that this would be the place.

181
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,045
But I could be wrong.

182
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:11,457
I can't figure out why N22 is Kyobashi to begin with?

183
00:12:11,695 --> 00:12:15,865
"N" stands for the Namboku Line, but there's no 22nd station.

184
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,625
Kyobashi is on the Ginza Line and right next to Nihonbashi

185
00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:21,265
so it should be G10.

186
00:12:21,765 --> 00:12:26,355
Besides, what is that arrow on the circle around Ebisu?

187
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:28,525
Does it mean the next station?

188
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:32,265
Naka-meguro and Hiroo are the stations on either side of Ebisu.

189
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:38,235
If so, why isn't it written H01 and H03? Gosh!

190
00:12:38,935 --> 00:12:40,425
Even the last three lines,

191
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:44,325
I02 is Shiroganedai on the Mita Line, so "Shiro" is chosen.

192
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:48,945
T22 is Baraki-Nakayama on the Tozai Line, so "Bara" is chosen.

193
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:51,825
But I can't make out C22.

194
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:55,475
The Chiyoda Line ends at the 20th station, Kitahayase.

195
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:57,735
Hey, show it to me, will you?

196
00:12:58,185 --> 00:13:00,765
That code, hurry, show it to me!

197
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:03,514
-Hattori? -Yeah!

198
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:06,215
The kids called to tell me that you were on the verge of tears

199
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:08,815
because you can't decipher the code.

200
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:12,815
So, I, a much wiser great detective than you

201
00:13:12,935 --> 00:13:15,965
shall help you out if you want, you know?

202
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:17,085
I'm gonna hang up.

203
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:18,515
Sorry, really!

204
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:21,685
Please let me help you, all right?

205
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:24,665
I'll forward it to you now, so hang on.

206
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:27,885
Why did you have to call him?

207
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:33,575
Because he's your detective master, isn't he?

208
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:39,425
-Huh? -He told us to call him anytime you needed help.

209
00:13:40,155 --> 00:13:42,115
He's not my master.

210
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:44,735
Well, it's true that I needed help, though.

211
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,985
I see.

212
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:53,665
Codes using subway lines and station numbers.

213
00:13:54,145 --> 00:13:55,935
Interesting!

214
00:13:56,055 --> 00:13:58,945
Hey, just whose cell are you talking on?

215
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:02,325
Oh, Inspector Otaki's!

216
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:07,285
We just closed a murder case at Shinsaibashi.

217
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:11,395
You're talking on my cell phone too, Conan.

218
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:13,795
And? Anything?

219
00:14:14,215 --> 00:14:18,125
Is this G11 really Nipponbashi?

220
00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:20,815
Yeah, it's the station next to Kyobashi.

221
00:14:20,935 --> 00:14:23,805
The alphabet and numbers are all correct, you know?

222
00:14:24,185 --> 00:14:28,325
Well, since both Nihonbashi and Kyobashi are subway stations in Tokyo,

223
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,055
it's no surprise that you don't know them.

224
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:32,935
What're you talking about?

225
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:36,515
Nipponbash and Kyobashi are both names of stations in Osaka!

226
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:38,855
Besides, there are many stations between them

227
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:40,215
and they aren't next to each other?

228
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:41,435
What?

229
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:44,765
Moreover, it's pronounced "Kyobashi",

230
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,825
with the accent on the first syllable.

231
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:51,795
Hey. You've got a station called Kyobashi over there, too?

232
00:14:51,915 --> 00:14:56,335
The code says so too, N22!

233
00:14:56,815 --> 00:15:00,015
The "N" stands for Nagahori Tsurumi Ryokuchi Line.

234
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:03,095
The 22nd station on that line is Kyobashi!

235
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:07,225
Which means... Don't tell me that this code...

236
00:15:07,345 --> 00:15:09,645
"Ebisubashi" -What?

237
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:12,825
You acquired a clue to deciphering the codes?

238
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:13,965
Yeah.

239
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:19,115
If there are stations in Osaka with station names, Nihonbashi and Kyobashi,

240
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:22,723
the code using line and station numbers

241
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:25,648
aren't limited to one specific district.

242
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:29,185
And, if so, the codes that I deciphered

243
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:32,685
from the 1st to the 5th lines to be December 3rd,

244
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:34,935
may be wrong, too.

245
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:36,165
Could be.

246
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:41,215
There are stations with numbers in their names like.

247
00:15:41,335 --> 00:15:45,755
Higashi-Mikuni, Yotsubashi, and Tanimachi Rokuchome.

248
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:49,055
It seems that Osaka and Tokyo are the only cities

249
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:52,155
with the station names Nihonbashi and Kyobashi.

250
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:56,375
Some of these codes are written to the left

251
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:59,815
-and others are written to the right, aren't they? -Huh?

252
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:02,695
True, it looks to be so.

253
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,263
Then! Maybe one side are the stations in Tokyo

254
00:16:05,383 --> 00:16:07,715
and the other in Osaka?

255
00:16:07,835 --> 00:16:09,165
If so,

256
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:11,125
the codes that you deciphered,

257
00:16:11,245 --> 00:16:14,705
until the 5th line

258
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:22,375
are all written on the left side, so they're all no good.

259
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:27,595
-But Nihonbashi in Tokyo is G11, right? -Yeah.

260
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:31,505
The Nipponbashi in Osaka isn't G11, is it?

261
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,875
No, it isn't.

262
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:37,355
The Nipponbashi in Osaka is K17 on the Sakaisuji Line,

263
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:40,855
and S17 on the Sennichimae Line.

264
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:45,335
If there is a note "Nihon" written beside G11,

265
00:16:45,455 --> 00:16:48,305
it's the Nihonbashi in Tokyo.

266
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,745
Hei-chan, I went and got it.

267
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:53,125
A book that has information of the subway lines

268
00:16:53,265 --> 00:16:55,125
and station numbers in Tokyo.

269
00:16:55,455 --> 00:16:57,325
Oh, I don't need that anymore.

270
00:16:57,445 --> 00:16:59,845
I searched online and found it.

271
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:01,215
What?

272
00:17:01,435 --> 00:17:03,035
Oh, come on!

273
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:08,095
I went all the down way to the kiosk in Shinsaibashi Station to buy it.

274
00:17:08,585 --> 00:17:11,025
The escalators were under maintenance, so I had to use the stairs

275
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:13,295
and I'm pooped.

276
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:16,225
What? Escalators?

277
00:17:16,655 --> 00:17:19,105
-That's right! Escalators! -What?

278
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:21,395
When riding escalators,

279
00:17:21,515 --> 00:17:24,735
in Osaka people move to the right and open the left side,

280
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:26,845
while in Tokyo it's the other way around, right?

281
00:17:26,965 --> 00:17:30,985
That's why the stations written on the right are stations in Osaka

282
00:17:31,105 --> 00:17:34,615
and the ones on the left are stations in Tokyo!

283
00:17:34,995 --> 00:17:36,415
I see.

284
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:38,515
That's why the page was divided

285
00:17:38,635 --> 00:17:40,815
and the codes were written on the edge of the pages.

286
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:44,625
If you take an overall look, it looks like stairs.

287
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:48,235
So, let's say that "December 3rd" is correct.

288
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:53,385
What stations in Osaka are N11 and Y12?

289
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:58,525
N11 is Taisho Station on the Nagahori Tsurumi Ryokuchi Line,

290
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:01,515
and Y12 is Higobashi, on the Yotsubashi Line.

291
00:18:01,635 --> 00:18:05,785
Both have circles around the 2nd number, so "sho" and "go" are chosen.

292
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:10,405
In other words, "shogo", meaning 12:00 noon!

293
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:12,395
Twelve noon!

294
00:18:12,515 --> 00:18:14,295
Only 10 more minutes to go.

295
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:16,665
No joke?

296
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:20,315
If the drug deal's going to be here at Ebisu Bridge,

297
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:23,835
-we better hide quickly, or they'll be here! -Yeah.

298
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:28,105
H02 is written to the left, so it's "Ebisu"!

299
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:31,179
If N22 is Kyobashi in Osaka,

300
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:33,837
I think that the deal will be at Ebisu Bridge.

301
00:18:34,495 --> 00:18:40,855
I don't know why there's an arrow attached to the circle encircling H02.

302
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:45,825
Hey, Hattori. Is there a bridge called Ebisu there, too?

303
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:47,590
Huh?

304
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:49,664
Hattori?

305
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:53,325
There is, here in Osaka.

306
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:56,485
The kanji characters are different,

307
00:18:56,605 --> 00:19:01,654
but there's a bridge that people often use to meet each other!

308
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:05,555
Is that right? This arrow indicates...

309
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:09,085
-that it's the Ebisu Bridge in Osaka. -Yeah!

310
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:13,535
I'm running over right now. I'll get there in two to three minutes!

311
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:17,115
-Wow! -He's good!

312
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:19,555
He's unmistakably Conan's master!

313
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:23,315
I feel sort of vexed.

314
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:26,895
By the way, what is "shiroihara"?

315
00:19:27,195 --> 00:19:28,765
I want the answers to the three remaining lines

316
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,565
under the location of the deals.

317
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:35,905
I02, C22 and T22...

318
00:19:36,115 --> 00:19:38,004
C22 that is written to the right is.

319
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:41,404
Takaida on the Chuo Line of Osaka, so it's "i".

320
00:19:41,524 --> 00:19:45,254
I02 and T22 that are written to the left,

321
00:19:45,324 --> 00:19:48,654
are Shiroganedai and Haraki-Nakayama in Tokyo.

322
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:50,120
So, you take "Shiroi" and "hara".

323
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:53,059
If you join them together, it reads "Shiroihara (White belly)".

324
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:55,225
I hope it doesn't mean that they'll be waiting

325
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:57,025
sticking their white bellies out.

326
00:19:57,485 --> 00:20:00,415
No, it should be read "Baraki-Nakayama",

327
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:02,305
not "Haraki-Nakayama"!

328
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:05,605
In other words, if you join them together, it reads "shiroibara".

329
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:10,055
It probably means a "white rose" will be the sign!

330
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,535
Hattori? What's up? Hattori?

331
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:19,865
-You can't hear him? -Maybe something happened?

332
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:24,180
Don't tell me he got caught trying to get the dealers.

333
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:28,155
He's so hot-blooded. It's possible.

334
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:32,085
Hey, Hattori? Answer me, Hattori!

335
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:34,865
-Hattori! -There're three.

336
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:39,515
I'm looking around Ebisu Bridge,

337
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:44,075
and I see three people with a rose on, holding it,

338
00:20:44,195 --> 00:20:45,515
or waiting for somebody.

339
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:50,355
Gosh.

340
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:54,525
-At least tell me that you're at the bridge. -Sorry.

341
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:56,785
I got carried away watching them

342
00:20:56,945 --> 00:20:59,285
because they look so authentically suspicious.

343
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:05,035
But, is it true that they're going do the drug deal here?

344
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:06,665
Yeah, most likely.

345
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:10,415
The owner of this pocketbook of codes

346
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:14,415
had at least 4 large bags of marijuana.

347
00:21:14,535 --> 00:21:18,575
Even if one bag were to be about 500 grams, 4 bags would total 2 kilograms.

348
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:21,235
The street value would be exorbitant.

349
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:23,935
They weren't packed in small packages

350
00:21:24,055 --> 00:21:28,145
so he was probably gonna sell the entire batch at once.

351
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:32,675
The deal may have already gone through, but...

352
00:21:33,285 --> 00:21:36,475
If the time arranged was noon,

353
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,985
they'd be meeting each other from now.

354
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:44,175
And? How did the drug dealer look?

355
00:21:44,295 --> 00:21:47,195
He was unshaved, wearing a knitted cap and a parka.

356
00:21:47,315 --> 00:21:49,125
The typical drug dealer type.

357
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:52,415
He was being chased by men who looked to be cops,

358
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:54,875
so they may already have arrested him, though.

359
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:58,755
He could've fled and headed over that way, so be careful!

360
00:21:59,155 --> 00:22:02,405
-I will. -By the way, where's Inspector Otaki?

361
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:06,595
He went back to the headquarters to get backup.

362
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:09,145
After all, I'm using his cell phone now.

363
00:22:09,825 --> 00:22:13,365
-There's only 5 minutes to go before noon! -Yeah.

364
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:16,883
I guess we'll have to narrow down the target

365
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,195
to one by then.

366
00:22:19,565 --> 00:22:21,325
Just the two of us!

367
00:23:42,945 --> 00:23:45,782
"Next Episode" -Isn't he the one? The bad guy?

368
00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:47,275
I think so, too!

369
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:48,495
Me, too!

370
00:23:49,245 --> 00:23:51,285
It's one minute past the time of the deal.

371
00:23:51,815 --> 00:23:52,965
That guy...

372
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:57,125
Hey, what's with you? What do you think you're doing?

373
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,085
Kazuha!

374
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:03,175
I'll throw you all over down Dotonbori!

375
00:24:03,295 --> 00:24:04,465
Bring it on!

376
00:24:04,715 --> 00:24:06,738
Hey, Hattori!

377
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,710
Next Conan, "Conan and Heiji, Code of Love (Part 2)"

378
00:24:28,555 --> 00:24:30,705
Next Conan's Hint:

379
00:24:30,825 --> 00:24:32,663
"White rose."

380
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,546
-Huh? New Year's monetary allowance? -Please give us!

381
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:37,796
Big brother, give me some, too!
