1
00:00:02,258 --> 00:00:03,757
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:05,557
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:05,558 --> 00:00:06,857
The boy who witnessed the crime.

4
00:00:06,858 --> 00:00:08,457
He is hiding something and acting strange.

5
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,457
Hints for the deduction are caterpillars and olive trees.

6
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:11,857
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:13,557
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:15,758
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:23,499
"Shimura."

10
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:46,999
Hey, you?

11
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:25,099
"The Youth Detective Squad and Four Caterpillar Brothers."

12
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:28,098
A new friend?

13
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:30,998
Yes! We'll have to take a side trip

14
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:32,398
but, I'll introduce to you all,

15
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:34,198
so come with me!

16
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,898
Hey, about the new friend.

17
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:38,798
Could it be a boy?

18
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,698
Hey, hey.

19
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:42,499
"Matsuura Heights."

20
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,099
What's this place?

21
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,498
Let me introduce you, then.

22
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:51,499
This is Taro!

23
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,498
Taro?

24
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:58,098
Look closely behind the leaves.

25
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:00,499
Behind the leaves, did you say?

26
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,499
What is it?

27
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,098
It's a caterpillar.

28
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:11,598
And it's huge too.

29
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,198
This one is Jiro!

30
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:17,399
And the smallest one here is Saburo!

31
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:20,699
Well... Aren't they cute?

32
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,598
I'm not sure that cute is the word.

33
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:25,898
Maybe more like gross.

34
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,198
Gross?

35
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,099
-Oh, no... -It' s true. They're really cute.

36
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:31,899
Look.

37
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,199
It's eating the olive leaf with all its might with its little mouth.

38
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:38,198
True.

39
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,898
Taking a good look at it, you can see that it has horns on its bottoms.

40
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:43,099
Yes, they're cute!

41
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:46,698
I wonder what kind of butterflies

42
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,698
they're going to turn out to be?

43
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,498
Aren't they going to be swallowtails?

44
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,398
I can't wait to see them.

45
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,898
This caterpillar...

46
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:56,798
I'm afraid they're not going to turn into butterflies.

47
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:57,898
Why?

48
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:00,098
I'm sure I saw them in my picture book some time ago.

49
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,099
Hey, hey.

50
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,798
Don't tell me that you carry that insect picture book wherever you go.

51
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:04,898
Here it is!

52
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:08,698
It is the larva of a moth called Psilogramma incretum, after all.

53
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,298
Psilogramma incretum.

54
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:12,799
Oh, so, it's not a butterfly.

55
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:15,998
Oh, but whether it's a moth or a butterfly

56
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:18,199
it makes no difference that it's a caterpillar, does it?

57
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,998
Right! They are cute after all!

58
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:23,999
Right.

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,099
Yeah...

60
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:29,799
I found Taro when I was taking a walk three days ago.

61
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,398
Then the day before yesterday, Jiro,

62
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,399
and yesterday I found Saburo.

63
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:42,199
Then, maybe today you'll find Shiro?

64
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:45,698
Hey.

65
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:47,998
No joke, there's really another one.

66
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:49,998
It still had other siblings.

67
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,798
They might be brothers!

68
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:54,298
It's the four caterpillar brothers!

69
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:55,898
It's strange.

70
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:59,699
After I found Saburo yesterday, I looked really well and yet.

71
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:04,598
It's too big to have just hatched.

72
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:07,898
If these worms are increasing one by one everyday.

73
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:10,798
This is a bit of a mystery.

74
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,198
I wonder about that.

75
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,898
Maybe they were just hidden by the leaves and not in view?

76
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:16,598
What's up you kids?

77
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:18,898
"Senkichi Matsuura (52)" -Is there something about this tree?

78
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:21,098
Oh, good morning!

79
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:23,198
We were looking at the caterpillars!

80
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,698
Caterpillars?

81
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:27,698
See, they're over there.

82
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:29,298
Let's see. Ouch!

83
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:30,598
Ouch...

84
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,098
Is something wrong?

85
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:34,999
No, I have frozen shoulder syndrome.

86
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:39,798
This is huge.

87
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,098
There are others over there, here,

88
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:43,599
and here too.

89
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:47,698
Really, I've got to get rid of them.

90
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,198
What?

91
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,199
Wait! Please don't kill the caterpillars!

92
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,698
Please! They're my friends!

93
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,798
Please, don't, please!

94
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:01,398
But, I can't afford to have them eat up my precious olive tree.

95
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,498
Oh, but with leaves as much as these,

96
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:05,899
they couldn't possibly eat everything up, could they?

97
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,898
Even if they eat the leaves they'll eventually grow back.

98
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:14,898
A caterpillar that's been killed will never revive again!

99
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:16,298
Okay, okay.

100
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:17,999
I'll leave it as is!

101
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,498
But, I wonder when they started increasing like this.

102
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:27,198
When I watered the tree last time I didn't notice them.

103
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,898
When was the last time?

104
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:31,398
Sundown on Thursday, so...

105
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,998
it was probably four days ago.

106
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:34,598
Four days ago...

107
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,398
is a day before Ayumi found the caterpillars.

108
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,498
Grandfather used to love the olive tree,

109
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:43,598
so he even named the coffee shop that he opened

110
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,398
in front of Beika Station "Olive."

111
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,399
Hi, welcome back.

112
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,598
"Minoru Yoshikawa (23)" -Mr. Yoshikawa.

113
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:49,998
"Matsuura Heights resident" -Hi.

114
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:51,698
He's...

115
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:53,198
Do you know him?

116
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,198
He's an employee at the convenience store near our elementary school.

117
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,598
A convenience store?

118
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,098
What's the matter, Mr. Matsuura?

119
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:03,598
Bugs were found on the olive leaves.

120
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,798
Bugs?

121
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,898
I drop off at the convenience store sometimes

122
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:09,498
on my way home from school.

123
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:11,698
I read fashion magazines.

124
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,898
Does it bug you?

125
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,398
It doesn't bug me, but...

126
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:18,699
Is it normal for a first grader to be reading fashion magazines?

127
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,698
Right, it seems something happened over there.

128
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,098
Over there?

129
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:27,099
You mean by Mr. Shimura's home?

130
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:33,699
It's Officer Takagi!

131
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:36,298
Oh, it's you guys!

132
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,398
You're not supposed to come in here without permission.

133
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,098
Did something happen?

134
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,099
Yeah.

135
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,998
An old man who was living alone was murdered.

136
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:45,098
What?

137
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:47,898
Is he the one who found the victim?

138
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,498
Yeah, he lives in the neighborhood

139
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:51,298
and used to play shogi with the old man.

140
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:53,598
It seems that the old man had several hundred million yen

141
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,598
stashed in his drawer.

142
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:58,598
But, the cash is gone.

143
00:08:58,599 --> 00:09:00,198
Hey, Officer Takagi.

144
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:01,298
What are you talking about?

145
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,898
Nothing really.

146
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:05,898
Do you kids know something about the case?

147
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:07,898
Not really.

148
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:10,398
Then, hurry on to school!

149
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,399
You're going to be late!

150
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,699
-Yes, ma'am! -Yes, ma'am!

151
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:18,698
I wonder how today's case turned out?

152
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,898
I wonder if they caught the killer?

153
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,798
Let's drop by on our way home!

154
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,799
No.

155
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,699
I don't think we need to do so.

156
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:30,898
What? You found a witness?

157
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,298
Yeah, a taxi driver.

158
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:34,698
Oh, well...

159
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,698
I can't tell you about the case.

160
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:39,198
It's okay, go ahead and tell them.

161
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:41,399
Okay then.

162
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,498
That driver happened to pass in front of the house

163
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:47,898
last night around 10 pm.

164
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:52,398
Then, the boy fell on his rear end in front of that man?

165
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,498
Yeah.

166
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:55,598
Did you see the man's face?

167
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:58,898
No, because I was still far away then.

168
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,698
Are you sure it was a man?

169
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:02,298
I think so.

170
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:03,698
How old was he?

171
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:04,998
I wonder.

172
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:08,399
Because my attention was mainly on the boy.

173
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:11,098
The time about 10 pm

174
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:14,298
matches the estimated time of death of the victim.

175
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:17,998
Although we have no conclusive evidence that the man is the killer.

176
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:20,598
I think it's well worth checking into.

177
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:24,398
Hey, if that man is the killer,

178
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,598
he probably bumped into the boy

179
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:30,798
right after he committed the murder and dashed out of the house.

180
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,798
Yes! My deduction is the same too.

181
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,398
If that so, that boy would indeed be the criminal witness.

182
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,298
You're exactly right!

183
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:43,798
But the taxi driver didn't see the boy's face,

184
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:46,298
and only remembers that he was wearing a white baseball cap

185
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:48,398
and something that looked to be pajamas.

186
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,398
Pajamas?

187
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,698
Then, it must be a boy who lives nearby.

188
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:56,298
Yes, and that's what I want to ask you about.

189
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:58,498
Do you have any idea of a boy who lives near

190
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:01,698
that house that wears a white baseball cap?

191
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:03,998
A boy who lives near that house.

192
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:05,899
Who wears a white baseball cap?

193
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,998
-It's Keiichi! -It's Keiichi!

194
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,498
Keiichi?

195
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:12,498
He's Keiichi Mitsui who is in the class next to ours!

196
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:15,298
He went to the same kindergarten we did.

197
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,698
His mother died of an illness this summer.

198
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:20,998
Before his mother died,

199
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:23,798
she bought him a white cap.

200
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,198
That's why he's always wearing that cap.

201
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:27,998
I see.

202
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,398
"Conference Room."

203
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,498
Thank you,

204
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:31,998
I'm sorry to have taken up your time.

205
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:33,398
Not at all.

206
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,199
You may go now.

207
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,798
I guess I'll be on my way too then.

208
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,599
Oh, thank you.

209
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:46,698
How was it?

210
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:49,498
Did Keiichi say he saw the killer's face?

211
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:50,898
Well...

212
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:52,998
I guess not.

213
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:55,998
Right, he denied everything.

214
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,698
Denied everything?

215
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:59,098
Keiichi says

216
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:00,898
that he didn't go out last night,

217
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,999
the night before or the night before last either.

218
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:14,100
"Shimura's house" -The place where the crime was committed is here.

219
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,800
"Keiichi's house" -Keiichi's house is here.

220
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:18,000
"Matsuura Heights."

221
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:20,100
The taxi came from this side.

222
00:12:20,101 --> 00:12:24,000
The boy is said to have gone to the right.

223
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:27,800
It is very likely that the boy was Keiichi but...

224
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:31,600
As long as he denies everything, we can't force ourselves on him.

225
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:35,301
Either he's scared of getting involved or...

226
00:12:36,301 --> 00:12:38,600
Don't you have any other clue regarding the killer?

227
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:41,600
Well, according to the driver,

228
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:44,600
that man thought to be the killer was holding the top part

229
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:47,100
of his left arm with his right hand.

230
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:48,200
Left arm?

231
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,700
That man...

232
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:52,001
His left arm was hurting too.

233
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:55,200
That man?

234
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:57,900
The four caterpillars brothers man.

235
00:12:57,901 --> 00:13:00,000
Four caterpillars brothers?

236
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:02,200
His name is Mr. Matsuura.

237
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:04,200
And, he lives here.

238
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,800
The same block.

239
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:09,000
That man had a sore left arm?

240
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:12,100
He said he had a frozen shoulder.

241
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:13,900
Frozen shoulder.

242
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:15,900
Shall I go see him anyway?

243
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:17,600
Do so, will you?

244
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:19,701
I'll go check on the other children.

245
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:26,700
I wonder if that man's the killer?

246
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:29,700
He didn't seem like such a bad person though.

247
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:32,600
But, he tried to kill the caterpillars!

248
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:34,700
What do you intend to do?

249
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:36,400
I think I'll go to Keiichi's house

250
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:38,900
and hear what he has to say in person.

251
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,201
But, before that...

252
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:50,200
It's the person we saw this morning.

253
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:53,601
I wonder how he found out about the case?

254
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:57,000
To get from this store to his apartment,

255
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:59,401
he doesn't have to go pass the house where the crime occurred, right?

256
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:03,100
Yes, that's true.

257
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:04,801
Maybe I'll go ask him directly.

258
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:07,600
Well...

259
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:10,300
Just when I came to the place to turn the corner to my apartment,

260
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:13,700
I saw people of the neighborhood turning the corner ahead,

261
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:17,500
so I went over to take a look.

262
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:20,300
Then, why did you come home right away?

263
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:22,300
I wanted to hit the sack a soon as possible,

264
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:23,700
because we don't have enough part-timers,

265
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:26,101
and I had to go to work again from afternoon.

266
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:30,100
He's not the culprit,

267
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,300
because his left arm looks okay.

268
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:33,600
Right.

269
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:36,100
Let's hurry over to Keiichi's place.

270
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:38,900
I guess so, let's go.

271
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:40,701
You guys, go ahead without me.

272
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:43,801
I want to take a look at some magazines.

273
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:48,701
Keiichi!

274
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:51,101
Ayumi.

275
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,000
What beautiful roses!

276
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:55,901
Ever blooming roses.

277
00:14:56,901 --> 00:14:59,100
There's an olive tree here too!

278
00:14:59,101 --> 00:15:03,400
It's very small compared to Mr. Matsuura's olive tree though.

279
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:06,200
There seems to be no caterpillars though.

280
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:09,400
Do you always take care of the plants?

281
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:11,600
Mother used to like them.

282
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:13,200
I took care of them

283
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:15,201
after she was hospitalized and after she died too.

284
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:20,200
Around what time does your father usually come home?

285
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:23,700
About 11.00 pm. Because he's busy at work.

286
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:26,600
Then, you're all by yourself till then, Keiichi?

287
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:29,000
What about dinner?

288
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:31,800
Father makes it before he goes to work in the morning.

289
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:33,800
I heat it up and eat it.

290
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:36,100
You're having it tough, aren't you?

291
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,700
Not really, because I've gotten used to it.

292
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:42,000
And, about last night...

293
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:44,401
Sorry, I've got something to do so I got to go.

294
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:46,801
Keiichi, wait!

295
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:51,100
He left.

296
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:53,100
I wonder if he got angry?

297
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:56,000
There's no doubt that Keiichi ran into a man

298
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:57,600
that could be the killer.

299
00:15:57,601 --> 00:16:00,000
But, why is he hiding it?

300
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,000
What was he doing outside around 10 am at night

301
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,901
in the first place?

302
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:12,200
The trace of it having been cut with nippers.

303
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:13,501
Maybe this is!

304
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:16,601
What's the matter, Conan?

305
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:18,701
What is it?

306
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:22,200
Conan?

307
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:23,600
Just as I thought.

308
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:25,400
Huh, what is?

309
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,401
Listen.

310
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,500
All these caterpillars were in the olive tree

311
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:30,800
at Keiichi's house to begin with.

312
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:32,200
What?

313
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:36,101
Keiichi probably noticed the caterpillars four days ago.

314
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:42,200
Keiichi who found the caterpillars was in a fix.

315
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,900
If he left it as is, the caterpillars would eat up all the leaves

316
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:48,400
of the olive tree that his mother loved.

317
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:51,200
But, Keiichi who has a kind heart

318
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:54,100
could not kill the caterpillars.

319
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:57,600
Just then Keiichi remembered that there was a large olive tree

320
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:00,101
on the east side of the same block.

321
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:03,200
It had dense foliage and looked to have more than enough

322
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:06,000
even if four caterpillars were to eat them.

323
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:08,500
So, from that night,

324
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:10,200
Keiichi started taking one worm at a time everyday

325
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:14,600
from his house to this house, in order of the large ones first,

326
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:15,601
after waiting till around 10 pm at night

327
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:18,400
when there weren't many people around.

328
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:21,401
He cut the branches with the caterpillars on them with nippers.

329
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:36,300
If he U-turns,

330
00:17:36,301 --> 00:17:38,901
it would be unnatural if someone were to see him.

331
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,200
So he went to the south, then west

332
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:44,900
and deliberately took the long way around.

333
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:47,400
"Shimura" -passing in front of the house where the crime occurred.

334
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,500
He went once around and then back to his house.

335
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:53,200
The caterpillars were moved from the branch

336
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:55,301
that Keiichi brought to this olive tree.

337
00:17:58,701 --> 00:18:01,300
That's why the olive tree at Keiichi's house

338
00:18:01,301 --> 00:18:03,200
had a few branches cut off,

339
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:05,300
while there were remains of branches cut with nippers

340
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:07,901
around this olive tree.

341
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:12,400
And on the fourth day,

342
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:14,900
when he finished moving the last caterpillar,

343
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:16,001
the crime occurred.

344
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:20,800
Keiichi felt guilty about having moved the caterpillars

345
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,900
from his house to someone else's.

346
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:26,400
That's why he denied everything when questioned by the police

347
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:28,200
and said he didn't go out last night,

348
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:31,000
the night before or the night before last either.

349
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:33,201
He went as far as to say what he didn't have to too.

350
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:35,600
You're fantastic, Conan!

351
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:37,900
I couldn't help but listen in amazement.

352
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:40,100
You're just like a real detective.

353
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:43,100
I am a detective.

354
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:45,800
But, I feel sorry for Keiichi.

355
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:48,600
I'm sure he's troubled about it.

356
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:51,801
Yeah, I think we should see Keiichi once more.

357
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,400
Edogawa?

358
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,800
The employee called Yoshikawa disappeared.

359
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:00,200
What?

360
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:02,000
According to the other employees he seems to have been

361
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:05,100
sweeping outside from after noon time right through.

362
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:07,300
Remember, he was wiping the glass door

363
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:09,400
when we went too?

364
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:11,700
Maybe he was looking for a boy

365
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:13,600
wearing a white cap come home from school.

366
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:16,200
You mean he was ambushing Keiichi?

367
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:19,200
But that man's left arm...

368
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:23,100
The culprit didn't hurt his arm when he bumped into Keiichi.

369
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:25,900
If he did, it should be more on the bottom.

370
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:29,800
Then he was holding his left arm because?

371
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:34,100
It's most likely that the killer was hiding the package

372
00:19:34,101 --> 00:19:35,500
with the money he stole

373
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:37,900
on the inside of his top and was hiding it under his left arm.

374
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:41,300
Then, he bumped into Keiichi when he went out,

375
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:44,100
and he reflexively placed his right hand on his left arm

376
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,300
to keep from dropping the money.

377
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:48,601
If Yoshikawa is the culprit...

378
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:51,901
Keiichi is in danger!

379
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:59,700
Keiichi...

380
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:01,000
He seems to be out.

381
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:02,500
Where'd he go?

382
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,600
How would I know?

383
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:07,101
-Darn! -That rose...

384
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:10,901
I thought there were more of them.

385
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:16,800
They've been cut with scissors.

386
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:17,901
Why would he cut the roses?

387
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:21,201
Mother used to like them.

388
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:23,601
I see!

389
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:30,501
Mother, I saw the man's face.

390
00:20:32,301 --> 00:20:35,300
Just what am I supposed to do?

391
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:38,301
So, you did remember my face after all.

392
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:44,801
Be grateful to me.

393
00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:51,301
I'll let you see your mother.

394
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:58,501
-Keiichi! -Keiichi!

395
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:05,700
Keiichi!

396
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:07,500
Darn!

397
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:08,601
Take that!

398
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:16,101
Keiichi!

399
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:19,001
Keiichi!

400
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:23,801
I'm okay.

401
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:32,000
Your cap?

402
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:34,300
It only stabbed your cap?

403
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:36,501
-Yep. -I'm glad!

404
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:41,201
Your mother in heaven saved you.

405
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:49,801
Yeah!

406
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:20,100
The caterpillars disappeared?

407
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:21,700
Don't tell me that you got rid of them, mister?

408
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,300
No.

409
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,500
I didn't do anything.

410
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:29,900
They probably dug into the ground to to become pupa.

411
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:30,901
Pupa?

412
00:23:30,902 --> 00:23:32,601
Oh, I see.

413
00:23:33,701 --> 00:23:35,600
-But what's a pupa? -Seriously?

414
00:23:35,601 --> 00:23:38,300
It'll be next spring

415
00:23:38,301 --> 00:23:43,200
when they appear before us again as grown moths.

416
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:45,500
Yeah.

417
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:48,300
By the at time,

418
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,701
I hope that my adult form...

419
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:54,901
will also return.

420
00:23:57,901 --> 00:24:00,500
"Next Episode."

421
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:02,100
Officer Takagi?

422
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:04,600
He had these on him.

423
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:07,800
Mr. Mouri's going to start his show soon, isn't he?

424
00:24:07,801 --> 00:24:10,500
In order to delay rigor mortis...

425
00:24:10,501 --> 00:24:11,700
Where is it?

426
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,700
This is...

427
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:16,300
I asked the the manager of this condo about it,

428
00:24:16,301 --> 00:24:18,800
and was told that it's an earthquake detector to switch off the gas.

429
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:20,501
An earthquake detector?

430
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:23,900
Next Conan,

431
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:27,901
"Picture Mail from a Clown."

432
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:45,900
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,100
"Stew."

434
00:24:48,101 --> 00:24:49,400
The next episode is about a sad clown.

435
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:51,000
Clowns are supposed to be funny, aren't they?

436
00:24:51,001 --> 00:24:52,901
Adults have a lot to think about.
