1
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:05,496
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:07,296
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,297 --> 00:00:09,296
It's a kidnap case demanding ransom.

4
00:00:09,297 --> 00:00:11,096
What happened in the tunnel?

5
00:00:11,097 --> 00:00:12,696
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,697 --> 00:00:14,496
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,497 --> 00:00:16,997
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,592 --> 00:02:02,391
"The Kidnap Car That Disappeared (Part 1)"

9
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:05,292
"Beika General Hospital"

10
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:10,191
Yeah, I thought that Masked Yaiba was going to lose yesterday.

11
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:12,991
What a thing to say!

12
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:16,492
Yes, he missed his Yaiba kick.

13
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:33,591
Jun!

14
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:34,991
Hello!

15
00:02:34,992 --> 00:02:37,391
"Jun Kataoka (7), Kataoka's son"

16
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:38,791
How's it, Jun?

17
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:42,192
How's your broken bone? Is it better now?

18
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:46,191
You don't look too happy.

19
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:50,891
They're Jun's classmates. They always come to visit him.

20
00:02:50,892 --> 00:02:52,691
Oh.

21
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:54,691
Thank you so much!

22
00:02:54,692 --> 00:02:57,291
Oh, no, it's nothing, really...

23
00:02:57,292 --> 00:02:59,892
We're friends so...

24
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:03,891
You two are always like that when you see pretty women.

25
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,492
How disgusting! Don't you think so?

26
00:03:06,492 --> 00:03:08,191
Hey! Jun.

27
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:10,891
I didn't know you had an older sister.

28
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:14,291
Did you call me his older sister?

29
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:16,191
Oh! Yes!

30
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:17,591
My, how flattering.

31
00:03:17,592 --> 00:03:21,091
She's Ms. Sachiko Ezaki, a fashion designer.

32
00:03:21,092 --> 00:03:23,991
A fashion designer?

33
00:03:23,992 --> 00:03:25,591
Wow!

34
00:03:25,592 --> 00:03:27,591
Did you come to visit Jun?

35
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:29,191
Yes!

36
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:31,392
Nice meeting you all!

37
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:34,491
Come over to my place someday!

38
00:03:34,492 --> 00:03:36,491
You're all very welcomed to come!

39
00:03:36,492 --> 00:03:38,092
Place?

40
00:03:38,492 --> 00:03:40,291
Jun's house.

41
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:42,391
Jun's house?

42
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:43,992
What do you mean?

43
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,291
She means...

44
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,991
I think you'd better go already!

45
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:54,291
Isn't it time for your fashion show recital to start?

46
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:57,191
Oh, right.

47
00:03:57,192 --> 00:03:59,091
We'd better get going then.

48
00:03:59,092 --> 00:04:00,391
Okay.

49
00:04:00,392 --> 00:04:02,091
See you, Jun.

50
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:05,591
Since Jun looks bored,

51
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:07,391
please spend as much time as you can with him.

52
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:08,692
Goodbye.

53
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:12,591
Jun, you'll be discharged tomorrow.

54
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:15,292
Hang in there just one more day, okay?

55
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:30,891
Is that person called Ezaki...

56
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:33,091
Is she going to become your new mother?

57
00:04:33,092 --> 00:04:38,491
How nice that such a pretty person's going to be your mother?

58
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:40,991
My mother who died was much prettier!

59
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:46,091
She's just marrying daddy because she wants his estate.

60
00:04:46,092 --> 00:04:48,191
Estate?

61
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:51,892
Right. Because I heard them.

62
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,192
What?

63
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:56,991
For me?

64
00:04:56,992 --> 00:05:00,092
I'm so happy! Thank you!

65
00:05:03,492 --> 00:05:04,991
How do I look?

66
00:05:04,992 --> 00:05:06,991
They look nice!

67
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:10,091
And, when shall we have the wedding?

68
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:12,591
Please wait a little while more.

69
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:15,791
Until the February show is over.

70
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:19,391
Are you saying you want to put all your energy into the show?

71
00:05:19,392 --> 00:05:20,691
Yes.

72
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:23,692
I want it to succeed this time no matter what.

73
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:26,591
If I don't make it again this time,

74
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,691
I'm going to give up my career as a fashion designer!

75
00:05:28,692 --> 00:05:30,491
My mind's made up.

76
00:05:30,492 --> 00:05:31,892
Okay!

77
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:34,391
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:34,392 --> 00:05:35,691
It's okay.

79
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:40,191
By the way, about this show, do you have enough cash?

80
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:41,991
If you need some...

81
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:46,691
I'm fine! If I ever need any, I won't hesitate to ask you for help.

82
00:05:46,692 --> 00:05:48,191
So, please be prepared!

83
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:50,592
Keep it within reasonable range now!

84
00:05:54,192 --> 00:05:55,591
Jun!

85
00:05:55,592 --> 00:05:58,491
Aren't you taking everything too negatively?

86
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,891
A pretty person like her could never...

87
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:01,992
Genta!

88
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:08,592
I understand how you feel. Revulsion against your new mother?

89
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:25,591
Game corner?

90
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:29,291
You know the one where the supermarket in Haido-cho is?

91
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,591
Do you want to go now?

92
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:35,091
Please! I've always wanted to go there. Just this once!

93
00:06:35,092 --> 00:06:36,591
But, you're still not fully recovered.

94
00:06:36,592 --> 00:06:38,191
I'm just fine, fine.

95
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:39,791
The cast is just for show.

96
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:41,491
I'm doing just fine.

97
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:42,991
See! Watch!

98
00:06:42,992 --> 00:06:45,191
But...

99
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:47,991
Are you sure you're okay?

100
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:51,191
You can go after you're discharged from the hospital tomorrow.

101
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:54,191
No way, impossible. It would never happen!

102
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:57,091
As soon as I'm discharged, I'll have to study with my tutor,

103
00:06:57,092 --> 00:06:58,991
go to piano lessons, and English class

104
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:01,391
that I won't have any time to go play games.

105
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:05,091
Well, I've always felt sorry for you behind the scenes.

106
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,791
So, please!

107
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,191
Today's the only chance I have.

108
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:10,591
If we can back here in two hours in time

109
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:13,191
for the 12pm rounds that the doctor makes,

110
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:15,091
they'll never even miss me.

111
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:18,392
Hey! What do you think, Conan?

112
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:22,191
In order to leave the hospital, first,

113
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,791
you'd have to go past the nurse station.

114
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:29,691
And, I'm pretty sure that nurse will come by and check the room.

115
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:34,491
So, as long as somebody sleeps in bed in place...

116
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:36,891
Hey! Hey! That's absurd.

117
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:40,291
Come on, we're friends, let's help him.

118
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,591
Yeah, please!

119
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:46,091
Jun's pleading with us too.

120
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:47,491
If we ignore his wish,

121
00:07:47,492 --> 00:07:50,091
it'll make a bad name for the Youth Detective Squad!

122
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:51,391
Right, Conan?

123
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:54,091
Okay...

124
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:55,791
Thank you!

125
00:07:55,792 --> 00:08:00,191
Shall we decide by stone, paper, scissors, then, Conan?

126
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:02,792
What? Stone, paper, scissors?

127
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:08,591
What's with him?

128
00:08:08,592 --> 00:08:11,691
Conan is really weak when it comes to stone, paper, scissors.

129
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,491
We don't have time, let's hurry!

130
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:15,591
Let's have eels over rice on the way home!

131
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:16,991
If you're treating us, Genta!

132
00:08:16,992 --> 00:08:18,392
Yeah!

133
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:28,892
Well, go enjoy yourselves to your heart's content.

134
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:33,092
Oh, no!

135
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:50,392
"Supermarket Moriwaki"

136
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:11,892
Jun?

137
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:16,792
Jun?

138
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,091
Hey! Hey!

139
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,491
Jun's bed is empty.

140
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:24,391
Do you have any idea where he went?

141
00:09:24,392 --> 00:09:25,591
No...

142
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:30,491
Come to think of it, a bunch of children came to see him.

143
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:31,992
Shall I go look for them?

144
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,291
It's me, Yoshizawa!

145
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:48,891
I kidnapped the kid named Jun.

146
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:52,791
It's going just as you planned.

147
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,091
Now?

148
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:57,792
Yeah, he's fast asleep.

149
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:02,091
Where is this?

150
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:03,592
What happened?

151
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:11,691
So, you're up, sonny, eh? Get down!

152
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:13,292
Hurry it up!

153
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:18,592
What's with you? You can't move yet?

154
00:10:19,592 --> 00:10:21,091
Where is this?

155
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:24,091
What're you going to do to me?

156
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:25,092
Hey...

157
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,891
Nothing much.

158
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:33,791
We're just going to ask your dad for ransom.

159
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,391
You mean I was kidnapped?

160
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:38,492
Well, I guess so.

161
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:50,891
Good!

162
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:53,391
Okay! That's it.

163
00:10:53,392 --> 00:10:56,291
Do the same for tonight's show!

164
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:58,091
Let's take a break till then!

165
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:59,391
Fantastic!

166
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,991
No mistake you're going to join the circle of top class designers now.

167
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:05,791
I sure hope so.

168
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,992
Believe in your ability.

169
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:11,592
Yes, this is Kataoka.

170
00:11:12,392 --> 00:11:13,591
What?

171
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:16,291
Jun's been...

172
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,591
Yes! Okay.

173
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:20,891
I'll head over there right away.

174
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:23,491
Jun... is something wrong?

175
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:25,891
It seems he disappeared from the hospital.

176
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:28,691
What? I'll go with you.

177
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:31,691
No, I'll go to the hospital alone.

178
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,591
You've got an important show to take care of.

179
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:35,991
But...

180
00:11:35,992 --> 00:11:37,091
I'm sure everything's okay!

181
00:11:37,092 --> 00:11:39,691
He probably went out to play some place nearby.

182
00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:42,091
There's nothing to worry about!

183
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:44,092
I'll get in touch with you later!

184
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:52,091
He hasn't gone home, and I've had the nearby area checked but...

185
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:54,891
Do you have any idea where else he could be?

186
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:59,092
I wonder. His leg is hurt, so I don't think he can go that far.

187
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:02,991
Sachiko!

188
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:05,191
Did you find out where Jun is?

189
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:08,191
Sachiko, go back to the show site!

190
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:10,691
Leave Jun to us.

191
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:13,091
What's most important to you now is...

192
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:14,991
Jun is more important than the show.

193
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:18,891
I won't go back until I know he's safe!

194
00:12:18,892 --> 00:12:20,191
Officer Sato!

195
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:21,192
How was it?

196
00:12:21,193 --> 00:12:23,191
I asked the nurses.

197
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:25,291
It seems that the classmates who came to see him

198
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:27,291
were Conan and the others.

199
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:28,891
Conan and his friends?

200
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:31,791
All four of them seem to have come together and gone home together.

201
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,692
Oh. Which means he didn't go out with them.

202
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,892
This is Kataoka.

203
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:47,692
You kidnaped Jun?

204
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:00,322
If you want your kid back,

205
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:03,422
get 30,000,000 yen in old bills ready!

206
00:13:03,423 --> 00:13:06,422
How's Jun? Is Jun okay?

207
00:13:06,423 --> 00:13:08,622
Yeah, he's fine.

208
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:12,022
I let you hear his voice right now!

209
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:14,922
Oh no. I don't have my voice changer either.

210
00:13:14,923 --> 00:13:16,422
Here!

211
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:19,023
He wants to hear your voice.

212
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:23,523
What's the matter?

213
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:26,022
Daddy.

214
00:13:26,023 --> 00:13:29,623
Jun!

215
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:33,422
Seems the kid's panicked that he's lost his voice.

216
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:36,922
Get the cash ready quick.

217
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:39,722
Oh, wait.

218
00:13:39,723 --> 00:13:40,723
He hung up.

219
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:43,622
Mr. Kataoka, does the voice sound familiar to you?

220
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:45,022
No.

221
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:47,022
This is the first time I've heard his voice.

222
00:13:47,023 --> 00:13:50,722
Jun's voice was so weak.

223
00:13:50,723 --> 00:13:53,022
I wonder if he's really safe.

224
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,622
I can't say, but please leave the rest up to the police.

225
00:13:57,623 --> 00:13:59,323
All right.

226
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:06,122
Inspector Megure! Everything's ready.

227
00:14:06,123 --> 00:14:07,823
Thanks!

228
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,122
All we can do now is wait for the kidnapper

229
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:13,723
to get back in touch with us.

230
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:24,823
Inspector Megure!

231
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:28,422
Please answer the phone, Mr. Kataoka!

232
00:14:28,423 --> 00:14:29,723
Yes.

233
00:14:35,723 --> 00:14:38,222
Hello, this is Kataoka.

234
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:40,222
Did you get the cash ready?

235
00:14:40,223 --> 00:14:42,822
Yes. It's ready.

236
00:14:42,823 --> 00:14:46,622
And, you're going to give Jun back to us, aren't you?

237
00:14:46,623 --> 00:14:51,222
Bring that money to the clock tower of the Ogane Park at 12pm!

238
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:56,122
12pm to the clock tower of Ogane Park. I'll be there!

239
00:14:56,123 --> 00:15:01,122
Hold it! You're not the one who's bringing the money!

240
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:04,723
We want a woman called Sachiko Ezaki to bring it.

241
00:15:05,523 --> 00:15:07,622
What? You want her to bring it?

242
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:11,122
We don't hassle with anybody acting funny.

243
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:13,722
We feel more secure if a woman brings it.

244
00:15:13,723 --> 00:15:16,423
Don't be late.

245
00:15:21,823 --> 00:15:23,023
Inspector Megure!

246
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,523
I'll go disguised as Ms. Ezaki.

247
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:29,722
No! Let me...

248
00:15:29,723 --> 00:15:31,622
Ms. Ezaki?

249
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:33,322
I'll go!

250
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:35,122
Sachiko?

251
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:37,722
The kidnapper demanded me to go.

252
00:15:37,723 --> 00:15:40,522
I'm sure he knows how I look.

253
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:44,622
But, if the worst should happen...

254
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:46,022
Please!

255
00:15:46,023 --> 00:15:49,822
Nothing... nothing can be greater than Jun's life!

256
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:53,722
Let me go! Inspector!

257
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:55,323
Inspector!

258
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:00,923
Inspector Megure.

259
00:16:05,623 --> 00:16:08,622
All right. Will you do it for us?

260
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:09,623
Yes.

261
00:16:09,624 --> 00:16:11,022
Inspector!

262
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:12,523
I know!

263
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:18,022
Ms. Ezaki, we will be 500m behind you

264
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:21,122
so that the kidnapper doesn't realize we're there.

265
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:23,822
I'll put this tracking device in your bag,

266
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:26,022
so we'll be able to locate the kidnapper right away.

267
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:27,722
And, if you need to get in touch with us for anything,

268
00:16:27,723 --> 00:16:29,322
please use this to contact us.

269
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:32,622
Sachiko, please don't do anything reckless.

270
00:16:32,623 --> 00:16:35,822
I promise I'll bring Jun back with me.

271
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:37,422
Sachiko.

272
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:38,523
Go on!

273
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,823
This is your grave! No use calling for help.

274
00:16:58,323 --> 00:17:01,122
I've got to get out of here fast.

275
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:05,022
Understand? When the kidnapper comes in contact with Ms. Ezaki,

276
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,622
if he has Jun with him, nab him on the spot.

277
00:17:08,623 --> 00:17:11,822
If Jun is nowhere in sight,

278
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:15,322
let the kidnapper go and get a hold of the whereabouts of Jun.

279
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:18,122
After confirming whether he is okay or not, then nab the kidnapper!

280
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:19,722
This is Sato at Ogane Park!

281
00:17:19,723 --> 00:17:22,322
All the investigators are in position!

282
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:25,223
Good! Be very careful.

283
00:17:29,023 --> 00:17:31,722
Takagi, come closer to me!

284
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:33,723
No, I'm just fine.

285
00:17:34,523 --> 00:17:35,722
Don't be silly.

286
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:38,022
If you don't, we won't look like lovers!

287
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,822
Oh, okay.

288
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:43,822
Come on, at least put your arm around me or something.

289
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:45,423
Here goes, then.

290
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:48,422
Like this?

291
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:51,023
Gosh! Get with it, will you?

292
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:58,223
Inspector! Ms. Ezaki's car has arrived.

293
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:09,422
Inspector!

294
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:13,123
A suspicious car is in view approaching Ms. Ezaki's car from behind.

295
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:19,122
It's a compact truck with the words Honeybee Courier written on it.

296
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:23,123
Would a kidnapper come in a flashy car like that?

297
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:31,422
It stopped beside Ms. Ezaki.

298
00:18:31,423 --> 00:18:33,022
Is Jun anywhere in sight?

299
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:36,022
No. I can't really confirm whether or not.

300
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:39,122
Jun? Isn't Jun with you?

301
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:41,522
One of my friends is watching the kid.

302
00:18:41,523 --> 00:18:43,722
I'll give him back to you as soon as I return with this ransom.

303
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:48,822
Tell the police that if I'm late getting back, the kid's dead.

304
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:50,922
The kidnapper grabbed the bag from Ms. Ezaki

305
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:53,722
and has fled by truck!

306
00:18:53,723 --> 00:18:56,422
The number plate on the truck is Shinjuku, two letters 44.

307
00:18:56,423 --> 00:18:58,722
"Mi" for Mikasa 328.

308
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:02,122
On its orange colored bed, there is a large honeybee mark.

309
00:19:02,123 --> 00:19:03,823
What shall we do, Inspector?

310
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:05,722
Don't get to close!

311
00:19:05,723 --> 00:19:08,522
Chiba, get the officers in emergency position on the double.

312
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,522
-Yes, sir! -Sato, Takagi, go after him by chopper!

313
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:12,722
Roger!

314
00:19:12,723 --> 00:19:15,522
A child's life is at stake, so be extremely careful.

315
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:17,923
Don't let him get away, no matter what.

316
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:23,123
Jun, isn't it about time we get going?

317
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:25,722
It's only a little after 11pm yet, though.

318
00:19:25,723 --> 00:19:26,922
See?

319
00:19:26,923 --> 00:19:29,222
Then, you can still play a lot more!

320
00:19:29,223 --> 00:19:31,922
Next, why don't we challenge the game over there?

321
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:33,222
Okay!

322
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:35,222
Genta, are you good at that game?

323
00:19:35,223 --> 00:19:36,223
Nope.

324
00:19:47,823 --> 00:19:50,623
Something... if I can only find something...

325
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:06,322
Inspector! The truck's headed for Kenbashi Tunnel!

326
00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:07,922
What's the length of the tunnel?

327
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:10,722
About 1km, so at this speed...

328
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:12,623
it'll go through it in about a minute!

329
00:20:15,123 --> 00:20:18,322
Inspector! The truck will soon be entering the tunnel!

330
00:20:18,323 --> 00:20:21,122
Go on ahead and wait at the exit of the tunnel!

331
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:22,123
Roger!

332
00:20:34,123 --> 00:20:36,022
It stopped.

333
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:38,023
It stopped in the center of the tunnel!

334
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:44,422
It won't budge with the strength of a child.

335
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:46,023
Darn it!

336
00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:52,522
Maybe the kidnapper abandoned the truck.

337
00:20:52,523 --> 00:20:54,822
Do you see anybody suspicious?

338
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:58,522
No, only other cars are coming out of the tunnel.

339
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:02,423
No humans, not even a cat for that matter.

340
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:05,622
Why? Why isn't it moving?

341
00:21:05,623 --> 00:21:08,622
Inspector, 10 minutes have gone by.

342
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:11,322
Okay, let's go inside the tunnel!

343
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:12,423
Yes, sir!

344
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:18,323
Darn! I've got to do something quick.

345
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:26,122
It was abandoned on the side of the road in the center of the tunnel.

346
00:21:26,123 --> 00:21:27,622
Which means...

347
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:29,222
The kidnapper threw away the communicator

348
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:31,122
and got away with the cash.

349
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:35,622
But the Honeybee courier truck didn't come out of the tunnel.

350
00:21:35,623 --> 00:21:37,222
Are you sure about it?

351
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:41,722
Yes. The pilot of the chopper as well as I was watching carefully

352
00:21:41,723 --> 00:21:44,822
but the Honeybee courier truck didn't come out of the tunnel.

353
00:21:44,823 --> 00:21:47,322
Maybe he made a U-turn inside the tunnel?

354
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:48,622
But if so, he would be driving

355
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:51,522
in the opposite direction on the freeway and cause a commotion!

356
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:53,222
Then, are you saying that the kidnapper's car

357
00:21:53,223 --> 00:21:57,322
disappeared in the tunnel?

358
00:21:57,323 --> 00:21:59,322
Another thing I don't understand is

359
00:21:59,323 --> 00:22:02,923
how the kidnapper found out about this communicator.

360
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:07,722
Officer Sato, I have something I want you to check for me.

361
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:08,823
Yes, sir.

362
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:03,622
Strange. Conan's not answering.

363
00:24:03,623 --> 00:24:05,422
I wonder if something's happened.

364
00:24:05,423 --> 00:24:08,322
What? What do you mean something?

365
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:11,322
I called the Honeybee courier company,

366
00:24:11,323 --> 00:24:14,422
and was told that the whereabouts of all their cars are known!

367
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:18,022
Could that truck have been stolen?

368
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,122
No.

369
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:23,723
Does that mean you have no clue where the kidnapper is?

370
00:24:25,123 --> 00:24:26,622
Next Conan,

371
00:24:26,623 --> 00:24:30,423
