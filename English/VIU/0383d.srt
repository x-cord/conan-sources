1
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:08,516
Konan High School is only one player away from winning the championship.

2
00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:12,716
No good! If the game ends the man's going to blow himself up!

3
00:00:12,717 --> 00:00:13,816
Darn it!

4
00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:16,616
We don't have time to go around the Alps stands nor the outfield seats!

5
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,016
What is this?

6
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,416
Why is there nothing written?

7
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:22,390
That fact that nothing is written...

8
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:25,617
A zero? Nothing? White?

9
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:44,788
He hit the ball!

10
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,288
An interesting ball that goes up left!

11
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:48,988
Can he catch it?

12
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,688
Can he pull through?

13
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:52,488
Will the scores be reversed?

14
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:53,989
Will the game end?

15
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:59,389
Don't catch the ball, you idiot!

16
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:03,088
He missed the ball, he missed!

17
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:04,789
Okay! It's a tie!

18
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:07,988
Missed?

19
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:10,288
Wait a second. If I'm not mistaken...

20
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:12,388
While the ball goes travelling outfield,

21
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:14,888
the batter runners go from second to third base.

22
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:17,189
Hey, Kudo? What's up?

23
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:21,689
The runner dashes out from third base!

24
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:25,889
The ball goes from hook-up to back home!

25
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:40,089
Safe!

26
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:45,288
A running homerun.

27
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:46,588
Fantastic!

28
00:01:46,589 --> 00:01:48,089
They reversed the score!

29
00:01:57,089 --> 00:01:59,888
Heiji, what's up?

30
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:03,088
Did you find out about something?

31
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,288
Ask this kid here.

32
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:06,388
Huh?

33
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:08,788
See, look at this map.

34
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:13,388
As to the entrance of the stadium, there are entrance from number 1 to 24,

35
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:17,688
but the numbers 17 and 22 are missing.

36
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:21,588
Missing? Number of the entrance.

37
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:23,688
Number 17 and...

38
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:25,588
number 22.

39
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:28,088
That's true.

40
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:32,789
The reason there's no code number is probably because of this.

41
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,288
Now that you mentioned it,

42
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:40,588
I heard that they blocked off gate number 12 and 22

43
00:02:40,589 --> 00:02:43,988
to make some kind of facility.

44
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:47,888
But which one is it? 17 or 22?

45
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:50,189
Where do we look?

46
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:03,788
We've no choice. Let's start from number 17.

47
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:05,388
Wait!

48
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:07,489
We don't seem to have that much time.

49
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,188
Now for the grand finale.

50
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:13,588
This is the bottom of the ninth inning with two out no runner!

51
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:15,988
Ohgane High School leads by one point.

52
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:18,888
The next batter is the one known for his three hits,

53
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:20,889
three base hits and one homer.

54
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:30,989
Number four, third, Nagashima.

55
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,588
They're going to pick on the weak point and make him walk.

56
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:41,288
He's the only one who's had hits, too.

57
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:43,888
They don't want to risk him striking a hit

58
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,089
and lose the game after all this.

59
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:50,989
Strike!

60
00:03:57,589 --> 00:04:00,188
Right in the centre? Straight!

61
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:03,088
Hey, hey. Is this the end of the game?

62
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:06,888
Those two are just like Shinichi after all.

63
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:08,988
Just like?

64
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:11,188
Just like Shinichi back in junior high school

65
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:13,688
during the soccer championship game.

66
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:16,588
It was lost time with the other team leading by 1 point.

67
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,488
With less than a minute to go, the other team scored another point,

68
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:21,788
so it seemed to be over.

69
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:24,588
Wanting to see what kind of look Shinichi was wearing

70
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:26,488
when returning the ball to the centre.

71
00:04:26,489 --> 00:04:28,489
I looked through the opera glass.

72
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,289
Then I saw him laughing.

73
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:35,388
Laughing?

74
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:39,388
Yes. I asked the other boys of the soccer club later

75
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,688
and you know what he was saying while laughing?

76
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:44,289
What? What?

77
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,189
I tell you, that guy...

78
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:57,788
Cool. If we win, we'll be legend.

79
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:00,189
Awesome.

80
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:04,788
And? How'd the game turn out?

81
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:06,188
Right, right!

82
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:08,589
They lost after all.

83
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:13,588
Life's not that easy, you see!

84
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:16,188
During the Penalty Kick.

85
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:19,088
Which means...

86
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:20,988
Right. With a minute left,

87
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,488
and Shinichi's goal and assistance,

88
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:26,688
they somehow made it to penalty kick.

89
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:30,188
But in the end it was Shinichi who didn't make the penalty kick, too.

90
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:36,189
But his rear view after that looked a bit cool.

91
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:48,988
Just a bit now, just a bit.

92
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:51,588
And Shinichi back then...

93
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:55,388
Those two kind of resembled him.

94
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,788
I mean, they refuse to give up.

95
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:01,488
The childish character of not wanting to lose.

96
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:03,288
I wonder if Heiji is that way, too.

97
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:05,489
Yes. I'm sure he is.

98
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:11,788
Strike two!

99
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,688
He swung at air! Two nothing!

100
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:17,588
Oh, no! They've been cornered!

101
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:19,888
It's no good, we won't make it.

102
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:21,388
Mr. Ohtaki,

103
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:24,288
in baseball, you never can tell until the very last minute!

104
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:26,588
If you have time thinking of something useless like that,

105
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:28,888
hurry and think of the meaning of the code, will you?

106
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,588
Right, but I mean really...

107
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:35,588
Big slugger of Konan is cornered!

108
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:38,288
Will he be able to pull the game out of the fire?

109
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:39,789
Nagashima?

110
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:44,488
Right! The missing number!

111
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:45,489
What?

112
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,488
There was no number in the parenthesis

113
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:50,388
because it's a retired number!

114
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,588
Retired number?

115
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:55,388
Between gates 21 and 23,

116
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:59,688
there is a booth for a professional team whose home ground is Koshien!

117
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:03,588
And there's a reference library where that retired number is displayed!

118
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,888
But Heiji,

119
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:07,488
isn't the area between 21 and 23 the place

120
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:11,388
where we were to begin with, the right stand?

121
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,389
Ran.

122
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:28,688
Darn it!

123
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,788
You mean she can't hear the phone because of the applause?

124
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:33,688
Pitcher Inao!

125
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:36,989
This is his 100th ball. There it goes!

126
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:41,589
He hit the ball!

127
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:44,688
Did it go up too high?

128
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:46,388
You idiot!

129
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:48,588
The centre spreads his arms out wide

130
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:50,888
and is waiting for the ball to come his way.

131
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:53,088
Konan High School, is it over for them?

132
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:55,588
Don't catch, don't catch.

133
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:57,388
Here goes, Hiroshi.

134
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,388
Don't catch it! Don't catch it!

135
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:01,389
I'm going over to where you are.

136
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:09,789
Don't catch the ball! Don't catch it!

137
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,665
Pitcher Inao!

138
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,366
This is his 100th ball. There it goes!

139
00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:25,938
He hit the ball!

140
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:28,737
Did it go up too high?

141
00:08:28,738 --> 00:08:30,337
You idiot!

142
00:08:30,338 --> 00:08:32,637
The centre spreads his hands out wide

143
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,737
and is waiting for the ball to come his way.

144
00:08:34,738 --> 00:08:37,037
Konan High School, is it over for them?

145
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:39,237
Don't catch it! Don't catch it!

146
00:08:39,238 --> 00:08:41,437
Here goes, Hiroshi.

147
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,337
Don't catch it! Don't catch it!

148
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:45,538
I'm going over to where you are.

149
00:08:49,338 --> 00:08:53,238
The Ohgane nine are overjoyed because victory seems near!

150
00:08:56,338 --> 00:08:58,537
The centre is still in position to catch the ball

151
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,637
and backs off slowly.

152
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:05,938
He still backs off.

153
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:15,238
He made it! He did it! It's a homerun!

154
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:19,038
It's a tie! A tie!

155
00:09:21,338 --> 00:09:23,937
Konan High School, the bottom of the ninth inning at the very last minute

156
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,537
with two outs, thanks to their big slugger Nagashima

157
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:30,237
ties their opponent with a score of 2-2!

158
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:32,537
That high fly...

159
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,338
Made it.

160
00:09:35,538 --> 00:09:36,838
Amazing.

161
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:43,738
What's this?

162
00:09:45,738 --> 00:09:48,038
What is going on?

163
00:09:54,238 --> 00:09:56,137
Dead ball!

164
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,637
Dead ball.

165
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,437
Two players in a row!

166
00:09:59,438 --> 00:10:02,638
Ohgane's ace Inao suddenly pitches out of control!

167
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:06,438
Is the homerun a while ago affecting him after all?

168
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:12,838
That's why they should've let number four walk.

169
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:16,737
He puts on airs,

170
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:19,637
gets hit and goes out of control, talk about getting worked up.

171
00:10:19,638 --> 00:10:22,538
This is going to be a walk-off homer.

172
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,737
Struck out swinging!

173
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:43,537
All right!

174
00:10:43,538 --> 00:10:46,337
What's with that pitcher?

175
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:49,938
The game is 2-2 and will be extended!

176
00:10:52,338 --> 00:10:54,138
What's this sound?

177
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:57,337
Behind your feet, Kazuha.

178
00:10:57,338 --> 00:10:58,538
Huh?

179
00:11:02,438 --> 00:11:04,437
The cell phone again.

180
00:11:04,438 --> 00:11:06,438
Gosh.

181
00:11:06,673 --> 00:11:08,673
Shall we answer it?

182
00:11:12,448 --> 00:11:16,047
Hey! I found the last cell phone!

183
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:18,047
Come on and show yourself!

184
00:11:18,048 --> 00:11:19,547
Heiji?

185
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:22,148
The game's not over yet.

186
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:26,147
It's an extended game.

187
00:11:26,148 --> 00:11:27,747
An extended game?

188
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:28,847
Yes.

189
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:33,947
The Demon of Koshien favours showing itself just before game sets.

190
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:35,947
Hey?

191
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:38,047
He says it's an extended game

192
00:11:38,048 --> 00:11:40,748
but the next code is nowhere!

193
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:43,247
Darn it!

194
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:45,447
Mr. Ohtaki, please look for him!

195
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:46,947
I'm sure he's still somewhere around here!

196
00:11:46,948 --> 00:11:48,448
Okay!

197
00:11:51,448 --> 00:11:52,947
Mail?

198
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:56,047
I'll look to the right. So please take care of the left, Mr. Ohtaki!

199
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,147
Okay!

200
00:11:57,148 --> 00:11:58,248
Wait!

201
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:02,648
It seems we don't need to look for him anymore.

202
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:35,047
Just as expected of the finals of Koshien!

203
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:37,647
It's a great game!

204
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:39,547
Nonsense.

205
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:42,448
This isn't such a great place.

206
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,247
Right.

207
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:51,748
If you guys didn't root, encourage and cheer him on like that...

208
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:58,848
If this place didn't exist...

209
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,648
my son wouldn't have...

210
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:33,555
He dropped the ball, he dropped it!

211
00:13:33,556 --> 00:13:37,155
He dropped an ordinary catcher's fly!

212
00:13:37,156 --> 00:13:39,755
Ohgane High School is playing the bottom of the 10th inning

213
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:42,855
as if possessed by the Demon of Koshien!

214
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,155
Faced up against an irregular hit,

215
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,655
fielder's choice and error along with two outs and bases loaded,

216
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:48,555
they are in a pinch!

217
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:51,955
Moreover, the next batter

218
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,855
is number four,

219
00:13:54,856 --> 00:13:56,356
Nagashima!

220
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:04,555
They're really up against the wall.

221
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:07,055
The Ohgane nine gather on the mound!

222
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:11,056
The disappointed catcher who had dropped the ball cannot lift his head.

223
00:14:13,356 --> 00:14:15,655
Of course he can't.

224
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:20,855
He made a blooper in front of a large crowd like this.

225
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:23,555
The other nine members of the team will hold a grudge against him,

226
00:14:23,556 --> 00:14:27,855
and the player as well as his parents, siblings and even his relatives

227
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:31,756
will face embarrassment.

228
00:14:34,256 --> 00:14:36,456
Just for something like this.

229
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:48,955
They're laughing.

230
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:51,055
That pitcher's laughing.

231
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,755
Really?

232
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:54,855
They split running to their positions with smiles on their faces,

233
00:14:54,856 --> 00:14:56,156
the nine members of Ohgane!

234
00:14:57,956 --> 00:14:59,055
It can't be.

235
00:14:59,056 --> 00:15:01,855
How can they keep laughing?

236
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:05,055
Why at this stage?

237
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:06,556
Because this is baseball.

238
00:15:09,056 --> 00:15:12,956
You can't play baseball unless all nine members are there.

239
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:18,555
I'm sure that the pitcher of Ohgane

240
00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:22,555
is thinking for himself as well as for the team

241
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:25,755
and for the catcher who made an error,

242
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:29,456
that he's going to slug this ball even if his arms break!

243
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:34,655
He hit the ball!

244
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:37,856
But the ball veered slightly to the left and is a foul!

245
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,955
Well, the number number that follows

246
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:43,955
probably wants to send the runner to home, so he's stepping out

247
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:45,655
and pitching the ball the way he is, even if the ball may hit him.

248
00:15:45,656 --> 00:15:48,255
Although no one knows which team will win yet!

249
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:49,955
Absurd.

250
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:52,855
If they go out of their way and get hurt, they can't become professionals.

251
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:56,055
They could be throwing their whole life away, you know?

252
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,655
What is it anyway?

253
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,756
What is there to this Koshien?

254
00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:04,655
Devastating! It's a right this time!

255
00:16:04,656 --> 00:16:07,155
The ball has enough distance! Will it make it?

256
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:09,956
It's a foul! Another big foul!

257
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:14,155
There's nothing.

258
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:17,955
Of course, I think there are many kids here who want to stand out

259
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:20,255
and become professionals.

260
00:16:20,256 --> 00:16:23,655
But that's all before the game.

261
00:16:23,656 --> 00:16:26,255
Once you set foot on the field

262
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:28,955
and hear the voice play ball,

263
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:30,855
for those kids out there,

264
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:37,456
it's a battlefield of whether you win or lose.

265
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:49,455
-Strike! -Strike three!

266
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:52,255
With three players left on base, no points have been scored!

267
00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:55,155
All they want to do is win,

268
00:16:55,156 --> 00:16:57,955
and win the championship.

269
00:16:57,956 --> 00:17:00,755
They have no feelings of profit or loss at this time.

270
00:17:00,756 --> 00:17:03,256
It's just a very simple feeling.

271
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:09,255
And since you've been involved with baseball,

272
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:11,955
you should already know of things like this.

273
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:13,655
Isn't that right?

274
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:17,355
Teito Jitsugyou High School's advisor for their baseball club,

275
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:19,456
Mr. Yukio Torimitsu.

276
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:30,555
Your son was run over,

277
00:17:30,556 --> 00:17:34,855
not because of the truck nor because of Koshien.

278
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:37,055
Your son tried too hard during club practice,

279
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:42,056
was pooped and braked too late.

280
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:46,055
Yeah, that's right.

281
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:47,855
I knew that.

282
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:52,155
I knew it, but unless I blamed it on somebody,

283
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:54,855
I couldn't stand it.

284
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:57,455
I had to do so to calm my heart

285
00:17:57,456 --> 00:18:00,656
that had been torn apart from losing my beloved son.

286
00:18:04,856 --> 00:18:09,556
But you wouldn't let me push the bomb button after all.

287
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:20,256
You, as well as both those teams.

288
00:18:23,056 --> 00:18:25,555
Of course not.

289
00:18:25,556 --> 00:18:30,056
This is a place where all the ones in Japan who hate to lose are gathered!

290
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:32,855
He's right!

291
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:34,856
Shall we go, then?

292
00:18:38,056 --> 00:18:39,855
The top of the 11th inning top,

293
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:42,356
Ohgane High School will be batting.

294
00:20:19,356 --> 00:20:22,355
Yes, that's right.

295
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:23,356
Yes.

296
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:25,956
Okay, thank you.

297
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:31,056
Somebody from this jurisdiction will be coming to pick you up.

298
00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:38,255
It's amazing how you deciphered that code

299
00:20:38,256 --> 00:20:39,456
that I thought up at the spur of the moment.

300
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:47,055
We figured out that 8, 1 and 2 was the Alps seat right away...

301
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:50,156
Thanks to the greatest man in Japan who likes to crack jokes.

302
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:57,155
What's up?

303
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,555
A cold?

304
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:01,155
Idiot! I'd never catch cold!

305
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:03,255
This seat is in the outfield, you know?

306
00:21:03,256 --> 00:21:05,456
It's not the Alps seat, you know?

307
00:21:09,856 --> 00:21:11,356
Such a great joke!

308
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:15,156
Sure, sure.
