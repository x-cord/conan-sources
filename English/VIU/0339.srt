1
00:00:01,797 --> 00:00:03,596
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,597 --> 00:00:05,696
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:07,496
Ai gets messed up in the Porsche case.

4
00:00:07,497 --> 00:00:09,396
Jodie, Araide and Vermouth appear.

5
00:00:09,397 --> 00:00:10,996
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,997 --> 00:00:12,796
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,797 --> 00:00:14,997
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,462 --> 00:02:01,162
"Four Porsches (Part 2)"

9
00:02:05,848 --> 00:02:09,747
The victim is Mr. Yukiya Banba, age 41.

10
00:02:09,748 --> 00:02:11,847
The cause is death by suffocation.

11
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:14,847
From the traces left on his neck,

12
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:17,948
it seems he was choked by a string-like object.

13
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:20,447
"Yukiya Banba (41)" -Moreover, it seems...

14
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:23,348
he was choked with quite some strength.

15
00:02:25,148 --> 00:02:27,847
And? Who is the one that found the corpse?

16
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,347
He's the one.

17
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:32,247
He seems to have gone golfing with the victim

18
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:34,648
and stopped by here on their way back.

19
00:02:37,648 --> 00:02:40,047
Who are the two people standing behind you?

20
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:43,347
Oh, yes. They are also golf friends.

21
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:45,747
As well as Porsche friends.

22
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,847
Conan?

23
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:50,247
You're also Porsche friends, right?

24
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:51,947
How did you know?

25
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:54,647
I came to this department store with Dr. Agasa and got off the car.

26
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:56,947
Then I saw them park their cars too,

27
00:02:56,948 --> 00:02:58,947
and I talked to them a bit.

28
00:02:58,948 --> 00:03:01,147
Where's Dr. Agasa then?

29
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:04,347
I think he's still shopping upstairs.

30
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:06,447
And, Conan...

31
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:10,247
Will you give me more of the details back then?

32
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:11,847
It was about 1:00 in the afternoon.

33
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:15,247
4 people came on this white Porsche

34
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:17,147
and only 3 got off.

35
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:19,247
They were saying that they were going to shop here

36
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:22,347
until that man's booze wears off.

37
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:23,547
It seems as if

38
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:27,447
they were going to leave after a while on their own cars.

39
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:30,947
Which means that these 4 Porsches are yours?

40
00:03:30,948 --> 00:03:32,147
Yes.

41
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:34,447
Inspector Megure.

42
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:35,547
A moment.

43
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,547
Did you find anything?

44
00:03:37,548 --> 00:03:38,648
Yes.

45
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,248
Thank you.

46
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:48,047
It seems that the suspects have been

47
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:50,647
narrowed down to you three.

48
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,147
What?

49
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,447
As a result of the autopsy,

50
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:56,747
the estimated time of death is around 13:00.

51
00:03:56,748 --> 00:03:59,747
Just about the time you all got here.

52
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:00,748
In other words,

53
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:02,547
it is extremely likely that one of you

54
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:07,447
strangled Mr. Banba when getting off the car.

55
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:10,347
Well, it may be a different story

56
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:12,147
if you left the car unlocked when you got off.

57
00:04:12,148 --> 00:04:15,348
I locked the door for sure!

58
00:04:16,248 --> 00:04:18,647
He was still alive when we got off.

59
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:19,648
What?

60
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,447
Mr. Hotei, Ms. Taiyama. Is it true?

61
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:27,147
Yeah. He was wasted and talking in his sleep.

62
00:04:27,148 --> 00:04:30,347
Saying something like "Another OB".

63
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:34,347
Besides, we all got off at about the same time,

64
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:37,047
so nobody had time to strangle anybody.

65
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:41,247
Well, please tell us more in detail.

66
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,847
Please give me your names

67
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:45,747
and your relationship with Mr. Banba who had been killed,

68
00:04:45,748 --> 00:04:47,647
the order in which you got off the car

69
00:04:47,648 --> 00:04:50,948
and which car you own.

70
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:54,547
I'm the first one who got off.

71
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:56,447
My name is Yoshihito Kureko.

72
00:04:56,448 --> 00:05:00,547
I got to know Mr. Banba at the Porsche new car exhibition.

73
00:05:00,548 --> 00:05:03,947
My car is this Porsche 911 here.

74
00:05:03,948 --> 00:05:05,947
When we go golfing, I park my car here

75
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:07,147
and all four of us get on this car

76
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:09,147
and head off together in one car,

77
00:05:09,148 --> 00:05:11,347
just like that boy mentioned.

78
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:13,547
We got off in order to wait for Mr. Banba's booze to wear off

79
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:17,347
and decided to kill time at the department store.

80
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:21,047
But I realized that I had left my cell phone in the car

81
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:24,148
so I came back to get it, only to see how I found him.

82
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:25,948
Which means,

83
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:28,047
you're the only one who could've killed him

84
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:30,747
without being seen by anyone.

85
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:35,548
No! I came back to the car about an hour later though.

86
00:05:37,448 --> 00:05:38,847
What is this?

87
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:41,447
This box in the dashboard compartment?

88
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:43,147
A music box.

89
00:05:43,148 --> 00:05:45,947
The pin broke, so I was thinking of sending it out for repair.

90
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:47,948
But I had completely forgotten it was here.

91
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:52,247
It seems to be working okay.

92
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:55,048
I guess you can't strangle somebody using something like this though.

93
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:59,847
I'm the one who got off after him. My name's Eiji Hotei.

94
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:03,747
I used to car race with him on mountain roads.

95
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:06,747
That is when we were young.

96
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:09,547
I'm into antique-like cars recently,

97
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:15,147
and bought a Porsche 356A that was made 50 years ago.

98
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:16,848
Excuse me.

99
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:23,047
Huh? There's something in the backseat.

100
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,148
There.

101
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:27,547
Those are my fishing goods.

102
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:30,247
I'm kind of into fishing lately.

103
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:33,247
You've even got an electric reel.

104
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:37,747
If this is used, you could choke his neck automatically.

105
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:39,647
Cut out that talk!

106
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:42,247
The reel was in the bag, wasn't it?

107
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:45,647
I came back here after I received call from Mr. Kureko

108
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:47,848
and haven't even touched the car yet.

109
00:06:49,148 --> 00:06:51,347
I'm Kaoru Taiyama.

110
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:54,247
It's true that I was the last one who got off,

111
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,447
but do you think that a woman like me

112
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:58,347
would be strong enough to strangle a man to death?

113
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:02,647
Besides, after golf, my gripping strength is weakened as is.

114
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:03,847
And?

115
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:06,547
What is your relationship with Mr. Banba?

116
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:08,047
Nothing special.

117
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:11,547
I just got into talking with him about Porsches on the golf course

118
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:14,847
and started making rounds with him.

119
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:17,547
This Boxter that I got right after it came out on the market

120
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:19,648
caught Mr. Banba's eyes.

121
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:25,447
You have something in the passenger's seat, too.

122
00:07:25,448 --> 00:07:28,947
Oh, that. It's a gift for the son of my cousin.

123
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,547
It's a radio controlled Porsche.

124
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:35,947
I could never strangle someone's neck with it, could I?

125
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:39,147
And besides, after getting off the car to go shopping,

126
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:41,147
I came back here after I got a call from Mr. Kureko

127
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:43,747
saying that something awful had happened to Mr. Banba.

128
00:07:43,748 --> 00:07:45,848
But I haven't touched a thing!

129
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:51,448
Hey! Why don't you look at that?

130
00:07:52,448 --> 00:07:54,647
-A surveillance camera? -I see!

131
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:57,447
I'm pretty sure we can find out if someone is lying.

132
00:07:57,448 --> 00:07:59,847
-Okay, to the security room! -Yes, sir.

133
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:02,247
Will all of you please come with me, too?

134
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,548
-What? -I guess we don't have a choice.

135
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:19,647
I told you to stay still!

136
00:08:19,648 --> 00:08:23,447
But Ai doesn't look too good.

137
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:24,947
I figured we should take her to the doctor.

138
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:26,348
We can't leave her like this.

139
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:31,447
I guess we have no choice.

140
00:08:31,448 --> 00:08:33,647
Just to be safe, maybe we should ask Officer Takagi

141
00:08:33,648 --> 00:08:35,947
to secretly let us out with his police car.

142
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,447
Because they may be ambushing us outside.

143
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:41,547
Hi!

144
00:08:41,548 --> 00:08:43,848
Who are they?

145
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:48,847
Conan, you were mixed up in this case after all.

146
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:50,647
Well... Yes.

147
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:53,447
But, how did you get in here?

148
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:54,647
Only those from the police

149
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:57,947
and those who are involved in the case are let in, right?

150
00:08:57,948 --> 00:09:02,047
We told them that we came to pick you up, then they let us in.

151
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:03,848
-Right, Ran? -Right.

152
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:07,047
Huh?

153
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,148
Ai is here, too?

154
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:15,047
Come to think of it, you're some detective, aren't you?

155
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:18,747
We're going to the security room to look over the surveillance camera,

156
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:20,248
so won't you come along?

157
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:23,248
Come on, let's go.

158
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,448
Okay, Sonoko?

159
00:09:29,748 --> 00:09:31,847
Hey! Jodie, you too.

160
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:33,447
Let's go!

161
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,448
Hey, Conan.

162
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,548
Reddish...

163
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:45,848
Brown hair.

164
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:51,247
What're you both doing?

165
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:54,647
Ms. Taiyama and Mr. Hotei?

166
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:57,447
After you got off the car,

167
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:59,547
both of you have gone back to your cars.

168
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:02,947
I just went back to get my wallet.

169
00:10:02,948 --> 00:10:06,948
Mr. Kureko always paid the golfing charges ahead of time, so...

170
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:10,047
So after this, all three of you

171
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:11,847
went into the department store together to shop,

172
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:15,847
and until Mr. Kureko went back to get his cell phone an hour later,

173
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,747
nobody went near the car?

174
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:20,447
So, didn't I tell you that

175
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:23,147
it was impossible for us to commit the murder?

176
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:25,747
It's unreasonable to think

177
00:10:25,748 --> 00:10:29,047
that they would call the police knowing that they'd be suspected.

178
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:33,547
Besides, all three of them got off the car at about the same time.

179
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:36,048
There wasn't anything strange about their moves.

180
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:38,947
I can't make it out.

181
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:41,647
How did the murderer strangle Mr. Banba

182
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:44,847
and how they retrieved the murder weapon?

183
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:47,748
Gosh! I've got to solve the case

184
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,748
and get Ai out of here...

185
00:10:54,648 --> 00:10:56,948
as fast as I can.

186
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,428
Inspector Megure.

187
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:09,328
The pictures of the interior of the cars of all three suspects are ready.

188
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:11,528
Thank you. Please leave them there.

189
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:12,829
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:21,429
This is it!

191
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:35,128
Sonoko, did you figure it out?

192
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,028
Maybe all three of them strangled him

193
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,928
before getting off the car.

194
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:41,828
-Or... -Hey.

195
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:45,828
Why don't we go back to where the car is?

196
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:48,028
We could figure something out.

197
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:49,228
Inspector.

198
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:50,828
I guess so.

199
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:52,728
Like they say, check the scene of the crime out 100 times.

200
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:54,629
Let's go back.

201
00:11:57,329 --> 00:11:59,228
She's the girl who was wearing the red hood

202
00:11:59,229 --> 00:12:01,928
in the bus that was hi-jacked.

203
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,929
The girl who was lying down in the car.

204
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:08,028
Don't tell me that...

205
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:09,529
It can't be.

206
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:18,628
Shinichi said don't move,

207
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:21,328
but if I leave Ai as she is...

208
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:22,628
I've got no choice.

209
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:25,529
I'll call Dr. Araide once more although he may not be in.

210
00:12:29,229 --> 00:12:32,328
"Araide Clinic" -Yes, this is Dr. Araide.

211
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:34,028
Dr. Araide?

212
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:36,328
I take it that you're Dr. Agasa, from your voice?

213
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:38,128
I'm in luck!

214
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:41,428
It seems that you weren't in when Conan called.

215
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:44,328
Conan did? That's strange.

216
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:47,029
I was home all day today.

217
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:49,929
What seems to be the matter?

218
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:53,828
I see.

219
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:57,228
So, you can't move from there because there's been a murder?

220
00:12:57,229 --> 00:12:59,828
Yes, sort of.

221
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:01,729
Why don't we do this then?

222
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:06,128
I'm here at the scene of the crime.

223
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:07,728
Have you noticed anything?

224
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:09,628
No, not really.

225
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:13,528
Why don't you have Sonoko check everyone's car?

226
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:15,229
Who, me?

227
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,528
You're a great detective,

228
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:21,128
so you may come up with something.

229
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:24,328
First from Ms. Taiyama's car that's at the very edge.

230
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:26,528
Will you lend me your key?

231
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:27,929
Sure.

232
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:31,828
Here, Sonoko.

233
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:33,529
Okay.

234
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:37,428
I can tell that it's an expensive car,

235
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:39,529
but there seems to be nothing strange about it.

236
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:46,529
Don't tell me...

237
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:49,028
Don't tell me Sonoko...

238
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,028
You mean it's come?

239
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:54,828
Yes. I've figured it all out.

240
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:56,628
The way Mr. Banba was strangled to death

241
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:59,528
while sitting in the passenger's seat,

242
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:02,428
and who did it, too.

243
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:03,729
Really?

244
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:06,528
If at all possible,

245
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:09,628
I wish she'd explain why she's explaining

246
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:12,528
while pretending to be asleep like Mr. Mouri does.

247
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:14,628
But have you really figured out the case

248
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:17,028
when all you did was get into the car and sit down?

249
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:19,828
I touched it when I sat down.

250
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:21,328
Touched it?

251
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:25,228
You see that little groove on the top side of the window glass?

252
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:28,728
When my finger touched it, it dawned on me.

253
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:32,729
That Ms. Taiyama, the owner of this Porsche Boxter.

254
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:36,628
You are the killer.

255
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:38,628
Hey, hey. Are you serious?

256
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,328
Ms. Taiyama did?

257
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:43,128
Officer Takagi.

258
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:44,828
Please sit in the passenger's seat of the Porsche 911

259
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:46,528
where Mr. Banba's corpse is,

260
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:49,228
and play the role of the victim.

261
00:14:49,229 --> 00:14:51,029
Okay.

262
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:55,928
Conan, proceed with what I told you earlier.

263
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:59,428
You mean this fishing line that you told me to go buy?

264
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:02,828
But can you really do something like that with this?

265
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:05,928
Never mind, just do as I told you to, okay?

266
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:09,028
Then, everything will become clear.

267
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:10,529
Okay.

268
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:18,128
First, hook the fish line around Officer Takagi's neck,

269
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:20,528
who is sitting down.

270
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:23,828
Then pull the string through behind the head rest.

271
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:26,929
Get off still holding the string and close the door.

272
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:31,028
Hold both ends of the string

273
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:34,628
and pull it through the Porsche 928 that is in between.

274
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:36,828
Go back to Ms. Taiyama's car

275
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:40,928
and hook it on to the groove on the window of the driver's seat side,

276
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:43,629
that was made beforehand, and then go back into the car, right?

277
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:48,228
But the marks left on Mr. Banba's neck

278
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:51,928
showed signs of him being strangled with great strength.

279
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:53,128
You probably want to say

280
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:57,028
that the string was pulled secretly from inside the car,

281
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:00,128
but I don't think it's possible with the strength of a woman.

282
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:03,429
Right. That's why Ms. Taiyama used...

283
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:08,029
The strength of the power window.

284
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:11,028
Ms. Taiyama probably wrapped

285
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:12,828
the string around the neck of Mr. Banba who was asleep,

286
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:14,928
like Conan just did.

287
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:16,028
Then she got off the car,

288
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:19,828
pretended to go get her wallet and got into this car.

289
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:21,928
She then opened the door

290
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:24,128
and tied the string pulling it tight,

291
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:26,828
then tied it onto the transmission lever or something.

292
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:28,928
All she had left to do was push the switch of the power window

293
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:30,428
and close the window.

294
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:33,429
The string would be pulled by the strength of the power window and...

295
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:43,228
This way, she can choke his neck

296
00:16:43,229 --> 00:16:45,028
even if she's at a distance from him.

297
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:46,629
Hey, Sonoko!

298
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:51,528
And since this parking lot is dark to begin with,

299
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:53,428
it's hard to see the string.

300
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,128
If the key is stopped at the first level,

301
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:59,728
she can move the power window without having to turn on the engine,

302
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:02,028
so there would be no loud sound.

303
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:03,328
Okay, I have a question.

304
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:05,928
How did she retrieve the string?

305
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:08,128
That's easy,

306
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:10,928
if she uses this radio controlled car.

307
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,228
She leaves the string that is tied beforehand

308
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:15,028
to the axle of the rear tire

309
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:17,428
of the radio controlled car outside the box,

310
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:19,928
cuts the string that had finished strangling his neck,

311
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:23,528
then ties one end of the string to the string that is outside the box,

312
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:26,228
and left the radio controlled car running inside the box,

313
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:28,428
and left the car.

314
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:32,828
It's true that if left that way, the string would automatically rewind.

315
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:35,228
But if she left the car running,

316
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:37,128
I would have heard the sound of the motor running

317
00:17:37,129 --> 00:17:39,828
when I checked this car.

318
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:41,428
Oh, don't you know?

319
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:45,128
The battery of a radio controlled car keeps only for about 10 minutes.

320
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:48,528
By the time you got here, it would've been stopped.

321
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:51,128
Why don't you try checking out the radio controlled car?

322
00:17:51,129 --> 00:17:53,728
I'm sure you'll find the string wrapped around the axle.

323
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:56,328
If it's just to roll up the string,

324
00:17:56,329 --> 00:17:59,328
it would be possible to do so using Mr. Hotei's electric reel, too.

325
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,428
But I knocked him off the suspect's list because...

326
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:04,429
Because of the power window.

327
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:08,628
Out of the three of us,

328
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:13,428
my Boxter's the only one with the power window, right?

329
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:16,328
I thought I did a pretty good job.

330
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,028
But I didn't think that such a cute detective

331
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:19,728
would see through my trick.

332
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:21,628
So, you're the one who killed him after all.

333
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:23,528
But, why?

334
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:25,528
Why?

335
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:29,428
I'm sure that he's thinking so in the world beyond, too.

336
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:32,428
He's probably wondering, "Why was I killed?"

337
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:34,528
I'm sure you've heard from him before

338
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:37,828
that he competed with a yellow Ferrari at a mountain path before?

339
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:40,728
Come to think of it, yeah, some time in the past.

340
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:43,028
But he said the driver of the Ferrari picked on him.

341
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:44,328
That's a lie.

342
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:46,928
He's the one who picked a fight.

343
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:50,328
I guess all he wanted to do was tease a couple.

344
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,028
But the one driving was my younger brother.

345
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:58,128
After a heated battle, our car went over the cliff.

346
00:18:58,129 --> 00:19:03,128
I was saved 3 days later by a person who happened to pass by.

347
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:06,028
But my younger brother didn't make it.

348
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:09,528
I couldn't remember the number plate of the man.

349
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:10,928
But I remembered his face

350
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:14,828
and that his car was a red Porsche 928.

351
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:19,828
I remembered that he had a golf bag in his car.

352
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:21,828
So, I bought a Porsche

353
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:24,828
and searched around the golf courses, finally found him

354
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:27,329
and was waiting for a chance to take revenge.

355
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:32,028
Why didn't you report the incident to the police?

356
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:34,128
I had no mind of telling the police about it.

357
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:35,528
Because my younger brother was also at fault

358
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:37,528
for being provoked into competing.

359
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:41,428
And my purpose for meeting him was not revenge to start with.

360
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:42,628
What?

361
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:47,128
If that man had called the ambulance right away for us back then,

362
00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:49,328
my brother would've been saved.

363
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:53,628
I wanted to know why he didn't call the ambulance.

364
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:56,228
If he said that he was afraid of getting caught

365
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,328
or if he said that he still regrets that day,

366
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:00,328
I was going to forgive him.

367
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:01,928
But he continued to play golf after that too,

368
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:03,428
just as if nothing had happened.

369
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:05,929
That's when I decided to take revenge.

370
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:13,028
Make sure that all you guys make speed rounds only

371
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:15,629
with your golfing and never with your cars.

372
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:23,528
Okay, the case has been solved.

373
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,128
I've got to contact Dr. Agasa right away

374
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:28,128
and get Ai out of here fast.

375
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:30,028
Quick, quick, hurry!

376
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,428
Ran, where's Jodie?

377
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:33,828
She went home

378
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:36,228
saying she had something urgent to attend to.

379
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:37,329
What?

380
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,129
Conan!

381
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:44,128
What?

382
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:45,729
Dr. Agasa and Ai are both gone!

383
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:48,628
Don't tell me...

384
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:50,129
No way!

385
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:19,328
Oh, I've been waiting for your call.

386
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:20,828
What do you mean you've been waiting?

387
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:23,428
I told you not to move and yet why'd you go back home?

388
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:25,428
You don't have to shout.

389
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:27,828
This is Dr. Araide's suggestion.

390
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:29,228
Dr. Araide?

391
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:30,928
Is he there?

392
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:34,528
Yeah. Ai is being examined now.

393
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:36,628
You said that he wasn't in,

394
00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:38,728
but when I called him, he was at home.

395
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:40,328
I told him that we can't seem to move

396
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:42,428
from where we are since there was a crime,

397
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:45,428
he said, "The police know who you are, and moreover,

398
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:47,928
with a sick child, if you ask them to let you out,

399
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:50,628
I'm sure they'll let you out."

400
00:22:50,629 --> 00:22:52,928
They gave us a lift in the police car and helped us get out.

401
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:54,928
But just when we got out of the department store,

402
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:58,428
she happened to pass by.

403
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:01,028
Hey. Don't tell me that she's...

404
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:04,728
Hi! I cut a lot of fruit.

405
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:07,629
Vitamin C is best for colds!

406
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,028
She just fell asleep.

407
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:13,128
Sorry.

408
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:14,928
Jodie.

409
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:18,028
She's the one who brought us here.

410
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:23,128
Thank God, she had parked her car in a different parking lot.

411
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:25,428
It seems that Ai has just come down with a cold,

412
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:26,829
so there's nothing to worry about.

413
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:32,229
Seven, eight, nine, ten...

414
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:37,829
Ready or not...

415
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:42,229
Are you ready?

416
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:45,428
Here I come.

417
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:47,329
I'm going to go look for you.

418
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,128
I see you.

419
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:56,129
I've found you.

420
00:23:58,829 --> 00:24:03,129
"Next Episode."

421
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:21,729
Doc!

422
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:24,928
Next Conan,

423
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:28,829
"Secret Hidden in the Toilet (Part 1)"

424
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:46,428
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:48,728
"Ai's older sister, Akemi Miyano."

426
00:24:48,729 --> 00:24:50,028
The next broadcast is on a culture day!

427
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:51,029
-Reading. -TV.

428
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,328
-Movies. -Mystery.

429
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:54,229
Put them all together and you get me.
