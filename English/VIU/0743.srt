1
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:07,156
They said it wasn't going to rain today, and yet...

2
00:00:08,756 --> 00:00:10,656
"Chain of Robberies Underway"

3
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:30,756
Ran!

4
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:33,156
Conan! Dad!

5
00:00:33,156 --> 00:00:35,656
You came for me. Thanks!

6
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:38,256
Gosh. It's already past 21:00, you know?

7
00:00:38,256 --> 00:00:41,156
I'm sorry. Club activity was extended.

8
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:42,556
Here, your umbrella.

9
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:44,656
Thanks, Conan!

10
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:00,656
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

11
00:01:00,656 --> 00:01:02,656
are slashed by the light of deduction.

12
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:04,256
There is a series of burglaries.

13
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,556
A coincidental prank takes an unexpected turn!

14
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:08,056
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:10,156
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:01:10,156 --> 00:01:12,656
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,656
"Coincidences Come in Twos"

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,675
You'd better be careful.

19
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:53,475
They say dangerous people have been appearing in this area recently.

20
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:55,575
You mean the robber wearing a hood, right?

21
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,975
I think it was...

22
00:02:56,975 --> 00:02:59,075
The so-called hood man.

23
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:01,075
The one who attacks women using a police stick

24
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:03,175
and snatch their bags.

25
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:07,175
Yeah. They all got away with slight wounds till now,

26
00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:08,775
but if the perp's not arrested soon,

27
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:11,175
his crime will start escalating and...

28
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:21,175
Hey, are you all right?

29
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:23,675
A man wearing a hood went that way.

30
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:25,175
I got it!

31
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:28,775
Hey, sir.

32
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,275
Conan.

33
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:33,875
How come your clothes aren't wet, sir?

34
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:37,975
What's wrong, Conan?

35
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:39,775
We've got to hurry or the perp will...

36
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:42,375
It suddenly started to rain.

37
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,775
Your shoes are muddy. Your pants are wet.

38
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,575
But you don't have an umbrella,

39
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:51,175
yet your clothes aren't wet. That's strange, isn't it?

40
00:03:51,175 --> 00:03:53,375
True.

41
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:57,675
Weren't you wearing something on top of your clothes till now?

42
00:03:57,675 --> 00:04:01,975
Like a jacket with a hood on?

43
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,375
Darn it!

44
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,675
Hold it!

45
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:06,675
Out of the way!

46
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:15,875
Well, I guess this was to be expected.

47
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,875
Hey, are you okay?

48
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,575
I'm fine.

49
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:22,275
Not you.

50
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:25,175
By the way, what about the scream we just heard?

51
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:27,175
This way!

52
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,375
Are you all right, Miss?

53
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:47,375
Well, thank you, Mr. Mouri.

54
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,575
We were having a tough time nabbing the hooded perp, you see.

55
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:54,575
Well, it was really no big deal, just the usual, Inspector.

56
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,075
This is a hospital, you know.

57
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:02,375
Shut up. I know.

58
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,575
Okay then, Inspector,

59
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:05,775
if there is anything I can help you with again, contact me anytime.

60
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:07,175
Yes.

61
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,375
Thank you very much.

62
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,075
Excuse me.

63
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,475
How was she?

64
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:19,475
She's fine. Her CT and EEG came out okay.

65
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:21,575
They say it's all right for her to leave.

66
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:23,075
I'm glad.

67
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:25,175
Thank you very much.

68
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:27,075
Thanks to all of you, I'm fine.

69
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:30,175
Oh, right! I've got to call my roommate,

70
00:05:30,175 --> 00:05:32,575
because I'm sure she's worried.

71
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:35,675
But I'm sure glad that she wasn't all that hurt.

72
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:39,475
Things could've been worse.

73
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:42,875
I'm sorry. Please excuse me for a moment.

74
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,575
Yes, Sato speaking.

75
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,575
Strange.

76
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:47,775
What's wrong?

77
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:51,775
Yoko's... My roommate's not answering the phone.

78
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:54,575
She should've finished work long ago.

79
00:05:54,575 --> 00:05:56,475
What?

80
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:57,775
A corpse of a woman was found

81
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,475
near the site we were at just a while ago?

82
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:02,675
Yes! Yes!

83
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:06,475
Mizuki, do you know what kind of clothes Yoko was wearing?

84
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:11,275
Huh? I think it was a white jacket and a beige skirt.

85
00:06:12,075 --> 00:06:14,775
Ms. Tachibana, are you sure?

86
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:18,175
Yes.

87
00:06:18,175 --> 00:06:20,975
Hey. Don't tell me...

88
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:23,475
No way...

89
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:25,175
What a bummer.

90
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:38,275
No mistake!

91
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:40,075
It's Yoko!

92
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:46,175
When she left this morning, she was just fine.

93
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:48,775
To think that it was the last I would see of her...

94
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,775
I had no idea!

95
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:52,875
Yoko!

96
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,875
Mizuki.

97
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:59,275
Ran. Stay with her, will you?

98
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:07,575
Judging from the circumstances,

99
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:09,875
it's been 1 to 3 hours since she died.

100
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,375
Yeah.

101
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:15,775
She works for an apparel shop near here,

102
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:18,675
and seems to have been attacked on her way home.

103
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:22,275
She's been slugged on the back of her head with a stick like object.

104
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,775
The method that the perp wearing the hood used up till now.

105
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:26,975
That is, the area he prevailed in, the time span,

106
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,675
everything matches.

107
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:32,275
Cash has been taken from the victim's wallet, too.

108
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:36,675
It's most likely that he was going to just leave a slight wound behind

109
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:40,175
but something came up and he ended up killing Yoko.

110
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:43,275
He then attacked Mizuki

111
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:45,875
when he was still in this excited state of mind.

112
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:51,775
What an incident. Roommates both attacked successively.

113
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:55,775
But that led to arresting the perp.

114
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,775
The bond that they had

115
00:07:57,775 --> 00:08:00,975
may have summoned such a miracle.

116
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:06,875
What is it?

117
00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:11,975
The smell of coffee.

118
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:16,575
This is...

119
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,975
You brat! Snooping around again.

120
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:24,975
Where are you all going?

121
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:26,675
We're going to have Ms. Tachibana

122
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:28,975
tell her story at headquarters too, you see.

123
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,875
We've got to get a written statement from her

124
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,375
regarding her own case, too.

125
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:36,375
I was thinking of going along with Mizuki.

126
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,175
I wanna go, too.

127
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:40,175
It's okay, isn't it, Pops?

128
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,375
I'd like to confirm.

129
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,875
The one who attacked you...

130
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,475
Are you sure it's that man?

131
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:58,975
Yes, I'm sure it was him.

132
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:00,575
Okay.

133
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:03,275
Doesn't he look sort of angry?

134
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:09,975
Yeah. He confessed to the series of robberies, but...

135
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:11,875
He insists that he didn't kill Yoko

136
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,275
and refuses to admit it.

137
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:16,675
About attacking Ms. Tachibana,

138
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:18,775
he says that he just didn't know what to do

139
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,575
because she had seen his face

140
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:23,375
and had no intention of killing her.

141
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:26,875
What's going on?

142
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,375
Tell us!

143
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,375
Come on, officer!

144
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,275
Like I'm telling you, we are in the midst of investigation now.

145
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:35,875
What's the matter, Officer Takagi?

146
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,975
Conan. Well...

147
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:41,075
But you've already caught that hooded man, right?

148
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:43,275
Are you all...

149
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:45,975
Right, we're victims of the hood man!

150
00:09:45,975 --> 00:09:49,775
You're going to get our wallets back for us for sure, aren't you?

151
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:52,075
My driver's license was in there, too!

152
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:54,075
Are you really looking for it?

153
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:55,575
Wait a sec.

154
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:58,575
Did all of you get your wallets taken?

155
00:09:58,575 --> 00:10:00,575
-Yes, that's right! -Yes, that's right!

156
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,075
What's going on?

157
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:06,175
Yoko who was killed had cash stolen from her,

158
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:08,775
but the wallet was left back at the scene.

159
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:12,775
Then, Officer Takagi, I'll leave them all to you.

160
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:15,175
Yes, I'll drive them all home.

161
00:10:15,175 --> 00:10:17,175
Wait, Officer Sato.

162
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:18,175
What?

163
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:20,175
There's thread on your skirt.

164
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:22,175
No joke? Oh, no!

165
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:24,575
I left the basting thread on.

166
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:26,875
Basting thread?

167
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,475
On the slits of brand new skirts

168
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:32,475
threads called basting threads are sewn on,

169
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:35,175
so that the two sides of the slits don't fall out of place.

170
00:10:35,175 --> 00:10:38,775
See? It's joined together loosely

171
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:42,175
by making a knot at the tip.

172
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:45,675
The skirt that I wore to work today ripped.

173
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:48,175
So, this is a new skirt I hurriedly bought.

174
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,475
I see.

175
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:02,444
Yes, Mouri here.

176
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:04,344
Inspector!

177
00:11:04,344 --> 00:11:07,344
What? Really?

178
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:09,744
Okay.

179
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:12,444
Did something come up?

180
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:15,944
The blood that was found on the special stick that the hood man used

181
00:11:15,944 --> 00:11:18,644
was concluded to be Yoko's.

182
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:19,744
What?

183
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:21,344
All's done, then.

184
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:23,844
Yeah. We've got concrete evidence, too.

185
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:27,444
It's been concluded that the hood man killed Yoko, too!

186
00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:30,144
I'm happy for you, Mizuki.

187
00:11:30,144 --> 00:11:34,144
Yes. I'm sure that Yoko in heaven is happy, too.

188
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:40,844
Boy did I eat, I'm full.

189
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:43,744
Miss, beer and fried chicken please.

190
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,044
That's enough, already!

191
00:11:46,044 --> 00:11:49,244
Who cares! The case has been solved, you know.

192
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:52,344
I'm just telling you to respect TPO!

193
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:55,544
Mizuki just lost her best friend, you know.

194
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:58,144
Well, well, come on, both of you.

195
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:02,444
I'm sorry.

196
00:12:02,444 --> 00:12:07,844
Yoko and I used to do things like argue and chat here, you see.

197
00:12:07,844 --> 00:12:10,144
I kind of happened to recall that.

198
00:12:10,144 --> 00:12:12,444
Mizuki.

199
00:12:12,444 --> 00:12:15,344
But I'm glad the perp was arrested.

200
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:18,144
I'm really grateful to all of you.

201
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:22,544
Hey, Dad!

202
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:24,644
That's my hot towel.

203
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:27,344
Yours is that one!

204
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:30,444
-Is that so? -Gosh. I don't believe it.

205
00:12:30,444 --> 00:12:32,744
Sorry, sorry. I'll give it back to you, there.

206
00:12:32,744 --> 00:12:36,444
No! I could never use this!

207
00:12:36,444 --> 00:12:39,344
Who cares! What's the diff?

208
00:12:39,344 --> 00:12:41,044
It's not the same!

209
00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:43,044
I see.

210
00:12:43,044 --> 00:12:44,644
That's what it was.

211
00:12:47,144 --> 00:12:49,844
Don't, Ms. Tachibana!

212
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:54,244
No, let me. This is my token of appreciation.

213
00:12:54,244 --> 00:12:58,044
No. We don't want problems later. Okay?

214
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,744
I see.

215
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:03,444
Thank you, for your consideration.

216
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:06,044
It'll be 10,250 yen.

217
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:09,044
Huh? It's pretty expensive.

218
00:13:09,044 --> 00:13:10,544
I wonder if I have enough?

219
00:13:10,544 --> 00:13:12,144
Thank you.

220
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:14,144
Sorry, Takagi.

221
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:23,544
Thank you so very much.

222
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:26,144
I know it's going to be hard on you,

223
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:27,844
but try to look on the bright side of things.

224
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:30,744
Call me anytime you get lonely.

225
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,944
I'll run right over...

226
00:13:34,244 --> 00:13:37,444
I'm sorry. Don't let it bother you.

227
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:40,544
I'll see you then.

228
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:47,044
Dad?

229
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:51,944
Mr. Mouri?

230
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:54,544
I finally got to the point thanks to the pain.

231
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:57,144
This case is still not over!

232
00:13:57,144 --> 00:14:00,144
Mr. Mouri, it's not over?

233
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:04,644
The one who killed Yoko isn't the hood man.

234
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,144
What're you talking about?

235
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:08,444
You said there was proof just a while ago.

236
00:14:08,444 --> 00:14:13,144
No. If he's the perp, some things don't fit.

237
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,944
Things don't fit?

238
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:18,544
Cash was removed from Yoko's wallet

239
00:14:18,544 --> 00:14:21,944
and the wallet was left at the scene.

240
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,344
But that's what the perp was after, right?

241
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:27,544
No. In the three previous cases,

242
00:14:27,544 --> 00:14:30,944
the perp stole the wallet and all.

243
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:33,744
Why was it different just this time?

244
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:36,644
It's true that it's a bit strange.

245
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:38,344
But that's not strong enough to go on.

246
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,744
Next for the wound on the corpse.

247
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:44,744
Yoko's wound was found on the left back of her head.

248
00:14:44,744 --> 00:14:47,744
Yoko was attacked from behind.

249
00:14:47,744 --> 00:14:50,844
This means that the perp held the stick in his left hand,

250
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:53,644
and slugged Yoko.

251
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:56,444
In other words, the perp is left-handed.

252
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:58,444
But the hood man is...

253
00:15:00,444 --> 00:15:02,144
Right handed!

254
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:03,944
By the way, Mizuki.

255
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,244
You made the call using your left hand,

256
00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:09,444
and tried to pay using your left hand.

257
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,044
It's true that I'm left-handed.

258
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:19,444
But there are many other left-handed people, aren't there?

259
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:21,144
There's more.

260
00:15:21,144 --> 00:15:23,944
On the white inner shirt that Yoko was wearing,

261
00:15:23,944 --> 00:15:27,544
there was a still new coffee stain on it.

262
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:30,644
But the stain was cut off at the partition of the skirt and her shirt,

263
00:15:30,644 --> 00:15:34,044
and there was no stain on her skirt.

264
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:38,244
A basting thread was on the skirt.

265
00:15:38,244 --> 00:15:40,244
A basting thread?

266
00:15:40,244 --> 00:15:41,644
Yes.

267
00:15:41,644 --> 00:15:45,644
The basting thread that is found on brand new skirts

268
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,844
so that the cloth won't fall out of place.

269
00:15:47,844 --> 00:15:49,744
Just in case,

270
00:15:49,744 --> 00:15:54,444
I confirmed this with the store manager where Yoko works.

271
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:55,944
It seems that Yoko,

272
00:15:55,944 --> 00:15:59,044
just before leaving the apparel shop that she works for,

273
00:15:59,044 --> 00:16:04,044
spilled some coffee on the clothes and skirt she was wearing.

274
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:08,244
That's why she bought a new jacket and skirt on the spot,

275
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:11,544
changed clothes and left the shop.

276
00:16:11,544 --> 00:16:15,844
That's why the coffee stain on her shirt was cut half way.

277
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:20,344
The basting thread was still on her skirt.

278
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:23,244
So, what?

279
00:16:23,244 --> 00:16:27,644
You talked to Yoko's corpse saying...

280
00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:31,244
When she left this morning, she was just fine.

281
00:16:31,244 --> 00:16:33,544
To think that it was the last I would see of her...

282
00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:34,944
I had no idea!

283
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:37,244
Yoko!

284
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:41,144
You saw Yoko in the morning and never since,

285
00:16:41,144 --> 00:16:43,744
still how did you know

286
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:48,444
what clothes she'd be wearing when she came back from work?

287
00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:50,144
Mizuki?

288
00:16:50,144 --> 00:16:51,744
Well, maybe in the morning,

289
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,344
she was wearing clothes of a similar color.

290
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:56,444
That's why I probably mistook what I saw.

291
00:16:56,444 --> 00:16:58,444
Mizuki, this.

292
00:16:58,444 --> 00:17:00,444
Pops said to look at it.

293
00:17:03,844 --> 00:17:06,144
-This is... -This is...

294
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:08,444
I had the store manager sent it to me.

295
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:13,644
This is a picture of Yoko before she changed clothes.

296
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:15,944
Please tell me, Mizuki.

297
00:17:15,944 --> 00:17:20,944
How could that ever look like a white jacket and beige skirt?

298
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:29,344
You saw Yoko after work, didn't you?

299
00:17:31,444 --> 00:17:33,444
But Mr. Mouri,

300
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:38,844
just that isn't enough to say that Mizuki killed Yoko, is it?

301
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:42,544
No. It's true that everything is circumstantial evidence.

302
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:44,744
They're not conclusive.

303
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:45,744
How rude

304
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:49,344
to treat me like a perp with just something like that.

305
00:17:49,344 --> 00:17:51,544
Yoko was my best friend, you know!

306
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:53,244
Right, Dad.

307
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:56,444
You need concrete proof to say something like that.

308
00:17:56,444 --> 00:17:58,644
Concrete proof?

309
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,744
I've got it.

310
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:02,444
Right here.

311
00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:06,444
Mizuki. For some reason

312
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:08,444
you put the wallet that you took out

313
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:10,844
at the family restaurant into your pocket.

314
00:18:10,844 --> 00:18:14,444
Why didn't you put it into your bag where you took it out of?

315
00:18:14,444 --> 00:18:16,344
You were afraid, weren't you?

316
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:17,944
That when you put the wallet back,

317
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:21,544
someone would be able to see inside your bag, right?

318
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:23,344
In your bag,

319
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:27,744
you had something that you didn't want us to see.

320
00:18:27,744 --> 00:18:29,644
Isn't that right?

321
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:32,544
I thought it was strange to begin with.

322
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:36,144
Tonight was a night so cold that you had to wear a jacket.

323
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:40,144
But you were dressed very lightly.

324
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:42,744
But if something came up

325
00:18:42,744 --> 00:18:44,844
that made you have to take off your jacket...

326
00:18:44,844 --> 00:18:48,244
Then, it's understandable why you're dressed like that.

327
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:50,344
You probably have the jacket

328
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:53,344
that has Yoko's blood stains on it inside your bag.

329
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:57,044
No, that's not all.

330
00:18:57,044 --> 00:19:00,544
The special stick that the hood man had to begin with

331
00:19:00,544 --> 00:19:03,044
should also be inside your bag.

332
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,344
Then the hood man...

333
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:08,344
What about the one he had?

334
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:12,644
That's indeed the weapon that Mizuki used to kill Yoko.

335
00:19:12,644 --> 00:19:14,444
Isn't that right?

336
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:20,144
First, in order to make it look as if the hood man did it,

337
00:19:20,144 --> 00:19:21,644
you checked out the special stick he used

338
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:23,644
when carrying out his serial thefts,

339
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:27,144
and bought the same one.

340
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:31,244
You killed Yoko with that special stick.

341
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:32,844
But on the way back home,

342
00:19:32,844 --> 00:19:38,144
you were ironically attacked by the real hood man.

343
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:40,044
How unfortunate.

344
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:44,444
However, a chance came about that changed your luck around.

345
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:46,044
Hey, are you all right?

346
00:19:46,044 --> 00:19:49,544
A man wearing a hood went that way.

347
00:19:49,544 --> 00:19:52,744
Back then, it dawned on you.

348
00:19:52,744 --> 00:19:56,244
You used the accident of being attacked by the real hood man

349
00:19:56,244 --> 00:20:00,244
to full advantage.

350
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:02,844
I see! She switched her own stick

351
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:05,644
with the one the hood man had!

352
00:20:05,644 --> 00:20:08,444
That's why Yoko's blood

353
00:20:08,444 --> 00:20:10,744
was detected on the stick of the hood man.

354
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:16,744
Yeah. I was just about to be deceived, too.

355
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:20,544
But during that hot towel incident, it finally dawned on me.

356
00:20:20,544 --> 00:20:22,844
I figured that maybe the murder weapon may have been switched

357
00:20:22,844 --> 00:20:26,244
at one point just like the hot towel was.

358
00:20:26,244 --> 00:20:27,944
Mizuki.

359
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:29,644
You were accompanied by Ran

360
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:33,044
right through after you were rescued.

361
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:36,744
You didn't have time to get rid of your jacket or the stick.

362
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:38,644
So, please show it to us.

363
00:20:38,644 --> 00:20:41,244
The contents of your bag.

364
00:20:49,244 --> 00:20:51,344
Mizuki.

365
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:59,244
Yoko was really like the sun.

366
00:20:59,244 --> 00:21:01,544
She was cheerful and selfish.

367
00:21:01,544 --> 00:21:05,444
The world always revolved around her.

368
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:07,244
In front of such a sun,

369
00:21:07,244 --> 00:21:10,744
I was no more than a powerless moon!

370
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:12,244
With all of what she had,

371
00:21:12,244 --> 00:21:15,444
she still took everything away from me.

372
00:21:15,444 --> 00:21:18,644
My clothes, my money and the one that I loved, too.

373
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,844
She thought that it was natural and all hers to own.

374
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:24,844
I put up with all of it, though.

375
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:29,644
Until I heard that one phrase.

376
00:21:29,644 --> 00:21:33,244
I'm sorry. Mizuki will be back soon, so...

377
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:37,944
I wish the hood man would get rid of her or something.

378
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:39,744
She's really a nuisance.

379
00:21:42,044 --> 00:21:44,744
That's why I finally did it,

380
00:21:44,744 --> 00:21:47,644
under the pretense that the hood man did it!

381
00:23:12,544 --> 00:23:13,844
Hey, dad.

382
00:23:13,844 --> 00:23:15,644
You picked on the food again, didn't you?

383
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,244
You ate my cake!

384
00:23:17,244 --> 00:23:19,344
No, I didn't.

385
00:23:19,344 --> 00:23:20,944
I know I usual do but this time,

386
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:24,744
that thief cat did it.

387
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:28,144
You're blaming Goro again.

388
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:37,644
This is a really perfect crime here.

389
00:23:40,944 --> 00:23:42,344
"Next Episode" -Yeah.

390
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:44,744
You were listening to the phone conversation?

391
00:23:44,744 --> 00:23:49,244
Your collar's stretched out and your underwear is showing.

392
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:53,544
This is called off-shoulder and I'm showing it on purpose!

393
00:23:57,244 --> 00:23:59,044
-Drowned. -Drowned.

394
00:23:59,044 --> 00:24:00,144
What?

395
00:24:00,144 --> 00:24:02,144
We're arresting you right here

396
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:03,744
and now as a murderer!

397
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:05,644
What?

398
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:10,944
Next Conan, "Makoto Kyogoku, A Suspect? (Part1)"

399
00:24:26,444 --> 00:24:28,744
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:28,744 --> 00:24:31,444
"Bowling alley"

401
00:24:31,444 --> 00:24:32,544
At the bowling alley...

402
00:24:32,544 --> 00:24:34,044
Karate vs. Jeet Kune Do.

403
00:24:34,044 --> 00:24:35,844
Why there?
