1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:03,402
The start of the age of mystery.

2
00:00:03,402 --> 00:00:05,202
The detective show on Monday at 7.

3
00:00:05,202 --> 00:00:07,502
The mystery code in Grandpa's diary.

4
00:00:07,502 --> 00:00:09,702
Treasure hunt in Yamaguchi.

5
00:00:09,702 --> 00:00:11,202
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,202 --> 00:00:13,102
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,102 --> 00:00:15,602
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:52,297 --> 00:01:58,097
"The Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour: Investigation Chapter"

9
00:01:58,797 --> 00:02:01,797
This Shrine here, is dedicated to Yoshida Shouin.

10
00:02:01,797 --> 00:02:04,697
The man who trained people who went on to become

11
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:08,497
the leaders of the Meiji Restoration of Japan.

12
00:02:08,497 --> 00:02:09,597
Shouin?

13
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:13,097
He lived 150 years ago.

14
00:02:13,097 --> 00:02:14,897
Meiji Regulation?

15
00:02:14,897 --> 00:02:18,297
Not regulation! Restoration!

16
00:02:18,297 --> 00:02:23,297
Shouin traveled throughout Japan to broaden his knowledge.

17
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:24,597
And because he wanted to change the country,

18
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:27,197
he also studied foreign systems as well.

19
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:29,197
That was when Japan kept out foreign cultures.

20
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:32,597
He studied Western culture, and, at the risk of his life,

21
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:35,597
he even tried to stow away to America.

22
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:39,097
But before his wish came true,

23
00:02:39,097 --> 00:02:41,597
Shouin was executed.

24
00:02:41,597 --> 00:02:45,797
Even so, others adopted Shouin's ambitions.

25
00:02:45,797 --> 00:02:47,497
And his pupils who listened to his teachings

26
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:50,297
and went on to change society!

27
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:51,597
Did you guys get that?

28
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:56,297
Hey, why do all these kids have to come with us

29
00:02:56,297 --> 00:02:58,597
for our Japanese history assignment?

30
00:02:58,597 --> 00:03:00,297
Come on, it's okay.

31
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:03,497
This is going to be a really fun day.

32
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:05,997
That should be my line.

33
00:03:07,497 --> 00:03:08,497
What's going on?

34
00:03:08,497 --> 00:03:10,297
Give me that!

35
00:03:10,297 --> 00:03:11,697
No! Stop!

36
00:03:12,797 --> 00:03:13,797
No!

37
00:03:14,797 --> 00:03:16,297
Hey you!

38
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,097
What are you doing?

39
00:03:19,397 --> 00:03:20,697
Wait up!

40
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:24,397
Are you okay?

41
00:03:36,597 --> 00:03:38,397
You were threatened?

42
00:03:38,397 --> 00:03:39,397
Yes.

43
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:41,297
They said, if I don't hand over this diary,

44
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:42,797
they will harm me.

45
00:03:42,797 --> 00:03:45,397
And if I tell the police, they said I'd be jeopardizing my life.

46
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:48,097
They told me that several times over the phone.

47
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:50,197
Do you have an idea who it was?

48
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,597
No, I have no idea.

49
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:56,097
It looks like a very old diary.

50
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:59,297
This is a gift from my grandfather.

51
00:03:59,297 --> 00:04:03,097
But there are only riddles and puzzles inside.

52
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:04,297
Puzzles?

53
00:04:04,297 --> 00:04:06,697
My grandfather loved word games.

54
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:09,697
And he would write down those in this book.

55
00:04:11,297 --> 00:04:14,197
But before I could get all the answers to the puzzles,

56
00:04:14,197 --> 00:04:18,997
my grandfather died five years ago on this day.

57
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:23,397
My grandfather loved Shouin,

58
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:27,197
that's why I went to the Shrine today.

59
00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:32,197
But why would they want an old diary?

60
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:34,697
I do not know either.

61
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:38,097
Mr. Mouri, could you please investigate this for me?

62
00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:40,897
Of course, I'll get right to it!

63
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:42,097
What's that?

64
00:04:42,097 --> 00:04:44,997
That place that was torn off earlier,

65
00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:46,697
there's something in it.

66
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:48,097
What is it?

67
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:50,397
It says, "On November 30th,"

68
00:04:50,397 --> 00:04:53,997
"the treasure will be revealed in the sunset."

69
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:56,597
"Solve the puzzle of the fox"

70
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:58,197
Treasure?

71
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:01,897
Ms. Kimiko, do you know anything about this?

72
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:04,397
Treasure... I remember him saying...

73
00:05:04,397 --> 00:05:08,497
Kimiko, I have a magnificent treasure

74
00:05:08,497 --> 00:05:11,797
that could buy the whole country.

75
00:05:11,797 --> 00:05:13,997
Wha... what?

76
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:16,797
Treasure that could buy the country?

77
00:05:16,797 --> 00:05:19,297
So, how many Unagi-bowls can I buy with that?

78
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:22,497
Why does everything have to be measured with food?

79
00:05:22,497 --> 00:05:25,197
But, what is this fox puzzle?

80
00:05:25,197 --> 00:05:27,297
Look at this.

81
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:30,497
There's a picture of a fox here in this page.

82
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,297
"Feed the carps to the fox",

83
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:35,297
what does that mean?

84
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:36,897
Carps in the moat...

85
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:40,197
maybe it's about my hometown.

86
00:05:40,197 --> 00:05:42,397
Where is that?

87
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:45,097
It's Tsuwano City of the Shimane prefecture.

88
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:47,097
We have to go there at once!

89
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,097
Why?

90
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,197
Tomorrow is November 30th!

91
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:55,497
We cannot let this chance pass us! We leave tomorrow morning!

92
00:05:55,497 --> 00:05:59,397
But how are we supposed to get tickets now?

93
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:01,297
Leave that to me!

94
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:04,297
Sonoko Suzuki is here to help!

95
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,597
I'll use my family's connections,

96
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:08,397
and whether it's a bullet train or express,

97
00:06:08,397 --> 00:06:10,497
I can get any ticket you need!

98
00:06:10,497 --> 00:06:13,197
That's the power of the daughter of the powerful Suzuki Family.

99
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:14,197
Yes.

100
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:17,397
And with this case in the hands of me, Kogorou Mouri,

101
00:06:17,397 --> 00:06:20,497
finding that treasure will be a piece of cake!

102
00:06:23,497 --> 00:06:25,497
We've got trouble.

103
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:28,797
That woman has gone to see Detective Kogoro Mouri.

104
00:06:28,797 --> 00:06:32,297
I see, continue to monitor her moves.

105
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:44,897
Thank you for accepting this case.

106
00:06:44,897 --> 00:06:47,097
No need to thank me!

107
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:49,897
What does it mean?

108
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:52,297
"Feed the carps to the fox".

109
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:54,797
Do you think carp are tasty?

110
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:56,897
Why do you guys have to tag along, too?

111
00:06:56,897 --> 00:06:58,397
Well, we think that's as plain as the nose on your face.

112
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:02,097
We're the ones who saved Ms. Kimiko in the first place!

113
00:07:02,097 --> 00:07:03,597
Jeez...

114
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:05,697
Writing down puzzles in a diary.

115
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:08,797
Your grandfather must have been very creative.

116
00:07:08,797 --> 00:07:12,897
Yes, he was always thinking about interesting things.

117
00:07:14,497 --> 00:07:17,097
Kimiko, how many stamps

118
00:07:17,097 --> 00:07:21,597
do you need to send a letter to the future?

119
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:23,297
Letter to the future?

120
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:26,097
What is the answer?

121
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:29,397
He never told me.

122
00:07:35,597 --> 00:07:39,297
Shin-Yamaguchi Station!

123
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:44,397
From here we will take the Yamaguchi Line to get to Tsuwano.

124
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,397
Kimiko!

125
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:48,197
Kimiko, are you okay?

126
00:07:48,197 --> 00:07:49,697
Yes... Yes, I am.

127
00:07:49,697 --> 00:07:51,697
Kimiko, who is this?

128
00:07:51,697 --> 00:07:54,497
I'm Shigeru Kawaguchi, Kimiko's friend!

129
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:57,797
I heard about what happened in Tokyo.

130
00:07:57,797 --> 00:08:00,797
We were the ones who save her, you know!

131
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:03,897
And we are...

132
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:05,697
The Youth Detective Squad!

133
00:08:07,397 --> 00:08:09,397
Good for you, guys.

134
00:08:09,397 --> 00:08:11,697
I owe you for protecting my friend.

135
00:08:11,697 --> 00:08:15,397
So, Kimiko, you're going back to Tsuwano, right?

136
00:08:15,397 --> 00:08:17,297
Yes... I am...

137
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:22,597
Ms. Kimiko?

138
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:26,097
Hey, it's me! Nine tickets were enough!

139
00:08:26,097 --> 00:08:28,497
Cancel the rest.

140
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:34,997
Wow!

141
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:37,297
I can feel the heat!

142
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:39,297
The smell of it is amazing!

143
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:41,797
All of you! Get on board this instant!

144
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:43,097
Okay!

145
00:08:44,697 --> 00:08:48,397
"Shin-Yamaguchi to Tsuwano"

146
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:53,597
For a limited time period,

147
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:55,397
real steam locomotives service the Yamaguchi Line.

148
00:08:55,397 --> 00:08:57,697
It seems like there are no seats left.

149
00:08:57,697 --> 00:09:00,997
How did you get these tickets?

150
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:04,797
I have some connections. It's pretty easy.

151
00:09:04,797 --> 00:09:06,497
Is there any hot spring spot?

152
00:09:06,497 --> 00:09:09,397
Around here, the Yuda hot springs are famous.

153
00:09:09,397 --> 00:09:13,697
That guy, Shigeru Kawaguchi isn't his real name.

154
00:09:13,697 --> 00:09:14,997
So you noticed?

155
00:09:14,997 --> 00:09:19,397
Kimiko's cell phone strap and his pendant are the same.

156
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:20,997
There are initials engraved in the back of each one.

157
00:09:20,997 --> 00:09:24,797
Kimiko's is "K.K" for Kimiko Kobayakawa.

158
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,397
But his says "A.T."

159
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:27,697
If his name is Shiegeru Kawaguchi,

160
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:29,697
it should be "S.K." right?

161
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:32,697
I wonder why he is hiding his real name.

162
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:37,397
I have some connections. It's pretty easy.

163
00:09:37,397 --> 00:09:38,597
I'll use my family's connections,

164
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:41,597
and whether it's a bullet train or express,

165
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:44,097
I can get any ticket you need!

166
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:45,797
That means he might be connected

167
00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:48,197
to someone powerful in this area.

168
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:03,397
What are you trying to do?

169
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:05,697
Listen to me!

170
00:10:06,497 --> 00:10:07,897
What's the matter?

171
00:10:07,897 --> 00:10:10,197
Oh, I was looking for the bathroom.

172
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:12,397
Oh, it's that way.

173
00:10:12,397 --> 00:10:14,097
Thanks!

174
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:22,797
Tsuwano!

175
00:10:23,697 --> 00:10:25,797
Excuse me, are you Mr. Mouri?

176
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:27,397
Yes, that is me.

177
00:10:27,397 --> 00:10:29,897
Thank you for coming from so far.

178
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:33,797
My name is Tsuneo Kikkawa. I work for the Kobayakawa family.

179
00:10:33,797 --> 00:10:36,097
Thank you for waiting on us.

180
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:38,497
Where is Ms. Kimiko?

181
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:40,797
She was with us just now.

182
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:42,897
Maybe she got kidnapped?

183
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:44,597
I'm here!

184
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:46,897
I forgot to get a gift for my mother.

185
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,497
I just ran to get something.

186
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:49,597
That's a relief!

187
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:50,797
It's funny that

188
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:53,497
I was just in Tokyo, but I'm buying her a gift here.

189
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:57,297
Where did your friend go?

190
00:10:57,297 --> 00:10:59,797
He left already.

191
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:01,197
Come on, let's go.

192
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,697
Development is our town's future!

193
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:11,197
And I believe everyone knows what I've done for the community.

194
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:12,397
Who is that?

195
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:15,797
His name is Hisamichi Takahashi.

196
00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:18,097
He is involved in real estate and construction

197
00:11:18,097 --> 00:11:19,297
around this area.

198
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:20,597
He has extensive business operations,

199
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,197
developing resorts and such.

200
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:24,897
Now he's announcing his candidacy

201
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:27,097
as a member of the prefectural assembly.

202
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:32,197
And this area will be vitalized and life will be better for everyone.

203
00:11:32,197 --> 00:11:34,897
And the one who can do it is me, Hisamichi Takahashi!

204
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:37,297
And only me, Hisamichi Takahashi!

205
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,397
Mr. Takahashi makes me feel safe and secure.

206
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:42,597
Yes, he's the one who loves this town the most.

207
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:46,097
To think such a splendid father could have a son like that is too bad...

208
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:48,197
Atsushi, right?

209
00:11:48,197 --> 00:11:51,797
How long is he going to keep acting like a punk?

210
00:11:53,097 --> 00:11:55,897
This is Tonomachi Street.

211
00:11:55,897 --> 00:11:59,797
And this is where the ancient samurai houses are still standing.

212
00:11:59,797 --> 00:12:01,897
Wow, look at the size of that carp!

213
00:12:01,897 --> 00:12:07,097
In the old days, they were raised as emergency food.

214
00:12:07,097 --> 00:12:10,597
Are we going to feed all the carp to the fox?

215
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,597
What are you talking about? This is a puzzle, remember?

216
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:16,197
We're not actually gonna feed them!

217
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:17,497
I know that bit!

218
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:21,297
Thank you so much.

219
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:24,997
No need to. I am glad that your daughter is back safe.

220
00:12:24,997 --> 00:12:29,797
Our house was recently robbed too.

221
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:30,797
What?

222
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:33,997
Maybe they were looking for the diary?

223
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:35,597
Maybe so.

224
00:12:36,597 --> 00:12:41,197
Mr. Mouri, please catch the people who are doing this.

225
00:12:41,197 --> 00:12:43,197
Of course.

226
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:45,697
So, it seems that Ms. Kimiko has heard

227
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:47,897
about this treasure from her grandfather.

228
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:49,297
Have you heard of this before?

229
00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:53,097
Yes, I have heard about it.

230
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:55,297
I heard that, because of this treasure,

231
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:59,397
the Kobayakawa family was restored after the War.

232
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:05,397
But I know that it wasn't only because of this treasure.

233
00:13:05,397 --> 00:13:08,097
It was by my father's hard work that made it happen.

234
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:12,097
But there are some who don't think so.

235
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:14,697
Especially some people who rose to power in the turmoil

236
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:16,497
after the Second World War.

237
00:13:16,497 --> 00:13:20,697
Since we've been deeply trusted by the local people historically,

238
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:23,597
they take advantage of every opportunity to get at the Kobayakawa family.

239
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:28,997
I see, so they might be the ones after the diary.

240
00:13:28,997 --> 00:13:33,097
-We have to find the treasure before they do. -Yes.

241
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:36,197
Can I eat now?

242
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:38,197
Oh, I'm so sorry!

243
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:39,897
Please go ahead!

244
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:41,497
Thank you!

245
00:13:41,497 --> 00:13:43,897
It is the sweets from Yamaguchi Prefecture.

246
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:47,697
It is slightly different from the ones in Nagoya.

247
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,697
-It's so good! -It's like jelly!

248
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:54,897
Mine already gone!

249
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:03,697
To feed the fox the carp means the carp disappear.

250
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:04,797
Mitsuhiko,

251
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:06,597
can you hand me the copy of this picture?

252
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:08,597
Yeah, sure.

253
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:13,997
-Conan? -What's going on?

254
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:16,797
How about this way?

255
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:20,897
The carp disappeared!

256
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:23,697
-It's true. -Oh, my...

257
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:28,097
"Feed the carp" should be about this!

258
00:14:28,097 --> 00:14:32,297
Well, you just folded it.

259
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:34,097
But look, there are letters.

260
00:14:34,097 --> 00:14:35,197
What?

261
00:14:35,197 --> 00:14:38,997
The patterns come together and form letters!

262
00:14:38,997 --> 00:14:42,597
"Below the top of the hidden Inari"?

263
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:44,297
Inari.

264
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:46,997
I can only think of the Taikodani Inari Shrine in this area.

265
00:14:46,997 --> 00:14:50,697
That's it! The treasure is at the Taikodani Inari Shrine!

266
00:14:50,697 --> 00:14:52,897
All right, let's go!

267
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:03,975
This is... an amazing numbers of arches...

268
00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:06,975
Yes, there are almost a thousand arches.

269
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:08,975
A thousand?

270
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:11,675
Are we going to walk up there?

271
00:15:11,675 --> 00:15:13,675
We have no choice.

272
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,375
I can't do it!

273
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,175
Come on, Genta!

274
00:15:23,175 --> 00:15:25,375
Just a little more!

275
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,775
We made it!

276
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:38,775
-It's pretty. -Look at the view!

277
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:44,375
So what does " Below the top of the hidden Inari" mean?

278
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,775
Hey, what's that?

279
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:49,375
-Is it food? -Fried tofu?

280
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,475
That is not for eating. It's an offering.

281
00:15:52,475 --> 00:15:55,575
Because fried tofu is the fox's favorite food.

282
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:58,175
Where do they put them?

283
00:15:58,175 --> 00:15:59,975
Are you planning to steal them?

284
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:01,875
You'll get punished!

285
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,875
I'm just asking!

286
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,775
They either put it at the main building,

287
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:10,675
or in the shrine at the back.

288
00:16:10,675 --> 00:16:14,575
Maybe that's the hidden Inari?

289
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:20,475
Here?

290
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:23,275
I don't see anything.

291
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,675
I found the fried tofu!

292
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:28,175
Now you know you can't get them.

293
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:31,675
-I said I'm not! -This is awesome.

294
00:16:31,675 --> 00:16:33,875
Hey guys, look at this!

295
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,975
So many foxes in there!

296
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:38,275
You're right.

297
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:40,275
It's cool.

298
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:44,475
I know! The hidden Inari is around here!

299
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:47,075
No, not there, it's here.

300
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:53,675
This is the hidden Inari.

301
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:56,875
Now, "Below the top of the hidden Inari"

302
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,175
There is a fried tofu figure made of stone.

303
00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:01,975
Fried tofu?

304
00:17:01,975 --> 00:17:04,675
I got it! The kanji that means "Top"

305
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:06,575
also could translate to the meaning of fried tofu.

306
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:10,875
So the treasure should be under the fried tofu made of stone!

307
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:14,975
-Awesome, Mitsuhiko! -You are a genius!

308
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:17,075
Thanks, guys!

309
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:20,575
A jar?

310
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,275
What's in there?

311
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,275
Well, there is some kind of paper.

312
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:29,275
This is...

313
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:30,975
It looks like a map.

314
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:33,375
There's something written on the top!

315
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,075
What does it say?

316
00:17:35,075 --> 00:17:37,075
"Reflect the castle in the eye of the cat"

317
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:39,575
"and look under the mouse."

318
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:41,175
What does that mean?

319
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:43,075
A cat...

320
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:46,375
It should be about this.

321
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,875
I see holes in it.

322
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:52,275
Not a mouse in any of the pages.

323
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:54,675
Another puzzle, huh?

324
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:59,775
This seems like the old map of the city of Hagi.

325
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:02,775
Hagi is in Yamaguchi Prefecture.

326
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:07,675
Yes, the city is linked to Shouin whom my grandfather adored.

327
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:11,975
I see, so the treasure should be in Hagi.

328
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:16,075
I see. They are headed for Hagi.

329
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:19,475
Stay with them, you hear me?

330
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,075
Where is Kimiko?

331
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:29,575
I'm coming!

332
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,275
It feels like a very old town.

333
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:44,775
They have preserved the town as it is was like in the old days.

334
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:47,575
So you can even walk through the town

335
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:50,075
even if you had a map from the Edo Period!

336
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:51,675
That is marvelous!

337
00:18:51,675 --> 00:18:54,275
The many people who were involved in the Meiji Restoration

338
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:56,575
have also seen this same view today.

339
00:18:56,575 --> 00:18:59,875
That's right! This is where the Meiji Restoration all began!

340
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,275
Here we go. The Meiji Reservation.

341
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,475
Restoration!

342
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:07,275
That's the reform that gave Japan its chance

343
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:09,575
to become a modern country like it is today.

344
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:12,475
Many people who were involved in the Meiji Restoration

345
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:14,475
were from Hagi.

346
00:19:14,475 --> 00:19:15,875
I see!

347
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,375
"Hagi Museum East Entrance"

348
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:21,975
The Cat Street?

349
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:24,775
Does this have anything to do with that code?

350
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:30,575
About 250 streets are named like that.

351
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:33,875
This street is named after a person who was close to Terumoto Mouri,

352
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,975
and since he was fond of cats,

353
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,275
they called it the Cat Street.

354
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:42,475
Look! A real cat!

355
00:19:42,475 --> 00:19:47,175
Oh, kitty cat! I know, I got it!

356
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:49,575
You mean you solved the puzzle?

357
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:50,675
Yes!

358
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:53,975
They meant the white walls, not the castle!

359
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:57,175
That means that one of these cats is watching a wall

360
00:19:57,175 --> 00:20:01,175
which will point out where the treasure is!

361
00:20:01,175 --> 00:20:04,475
And that cat right there is looking at it right...

362
00:20:04,475 --> 00:20:06,675
Wait! Please wait, Kitty!

363
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:09,575
I'm very sure that he is wrong.

364
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,875
Mr. Mouri sure has a sense of humor.

365
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,575
The problem is that he's dead serious.

366
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,775
That was the guy who called himself Shigeru Kawaguchi?

367
00:20:28,675 --> 00:20:30,875
Can't you understand what I'm saying?

368
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,875
But...

369
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,175
It is him.

370
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,675
That man...

371
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:42,475
The guy who attacked Kimiko!

372
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:47,475
This is where the doctor in the Edo period named Shusuke Aoki

373
00:20:47,475 --> 00:20:49,075
was living.

374
00:20:49,075 --> 00:20:51,775
They say that they found treasure buried here.

375
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:53,675
You know well!

376
00:20:53,675 --> 00:20:55,475
Really?

377
00:20:55,475 --> 00:20:58,975
Yes, they say that they found it from under the cellar.

378
00:20:58,975 --> 00:21:01,175
Treasure!

379
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,675
There is a treasure, I'm sure!

380
00:21:03,675 --> 00:21:05,075
I think so too!

381
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:06,475
I'm getting excited!

382
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:09,275
Me too!

383
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:12,175
Now, let's head to the Hagi Castle!

384
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:23,675
What does Shigeru have to do with those men?

385
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:26,075
And who is he exactly?

386
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,375
-Hurry up! -Be quiet!

387
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,775
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

388
00:21:34,775 --> 00:21:37,175
-The keys! -You little brat!

389
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:39,675
Police! This way! Come quick!

390
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,475
Hurry up! We're moving!

391
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,875
Mitsuhiko!

392
00:21:45,675 --> 00:21:47,175
What's going on?

393
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,375
Thanks!

394
00:21:54,975 --> 00:21:56,375
You're not getting away!

395
00:22:03,575 --> 00:22:05,375
Crack!

396
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,475
No, I didn't think they would go this far.

397
00:22:08,475 --> 00:22:12,075
I didn't pay enough attention.

398
00:22:12,075 --> 00:22:16,275
Is there really a treasure that could buy a country?

399
00:22:16,275 --> 00:22:21,675
And who are those men?

400
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,175
And that voice...

401
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,775
Police! This way! Come quick!

402
00:22:25,775 --> 00:22:28,175
I know that voice, and it is...

403
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:53,075
We have the girl and the children.

404
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:55,775
Find that treasure or else!

405
00:23:58,075 --> 00:23:59,175
Conan?

406
00:23:59,175 --> 00:24:00,375
Mitsuhiko?

407
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:02,775
Mitsuhiko!

408
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,875
"Draw the map in the cave where the water goblin lives."

409
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,975
Where is this cave?

410
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:11,475
We have to hurry.

411
00:24:11,475 --> 00:24:14,875
We only have time until sunset!

412
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,475
Next Conan,

413
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:20,375
"The Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour: Deciphering Chapter"

414
00:24:31,175 --> 00:24:33,275
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:33,275 --> 00:24:35,575
"Cat"

416
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:37,375
Meow! Treasure discovered in the next episode!

417
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,775
How many servings of broiled eel on rice will I be able to eat?

418
00:24:38,775 --> 00:24:40,070
One-track mind.
