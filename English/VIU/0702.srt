1
00:00:00,805 --> 00:00:04,105
I participated in the Bell Tree Express event together

2
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:05,605
with the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,630
Ran and the others.

4
00:00:08,405 --> 00:00:12,105
Suspicious passengers are gathered in car number 8.

5
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:16,605
A dark shadow closes in on Haibara.

6
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:21,705
And the deduction quiz that is carried out in the train

7
00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:24,605
changes into a locked room murder!

8
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:30,005
Aim for a 100% solution.

9
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:32,605
Clear all mysteries and codes.

10
00:00:32,605 --> 00:00:34,505
The car that disappeared during the locked room murder.

11
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:36,505
The suspicious testimonies of the passengers.

12
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:38,105
He sees through the one and only truth.

13
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,105
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

14
00:00:40,105 --> 00:00:42,705
His name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:28,572
"Pitch Black Mystery Express Train (Tunnel)"

16
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:32,356
Murder?

17
00:02:32,356 --> 00:02:35,256
You mean, this is a real murder?

18
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:39,956
Yeah. Somebody shot him right through his temple.

19
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:43,256
But this room was chain locked,

20
00:02:43,398 --> 00:02:46,198
so you had to break the door down to get in, didn't you?

21
00:02:46,198 --> 00:02:48,298
So, wouldn't that make it suicide?

22
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:49,998
Although it's still a mystery

23
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:52,098
how the door was locked since...

24
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:55,398
there are no burns around the gun shot of the temple.

25
00:02:55,398 --> 00:02:58,398
That's proof that he was shot from a distance!

26
00:02:58,398 --> 00:03:00,798
When someone shoots his own head with a gun,

27
00:03:00,798 --> 00:03:03,898
the gun should be pressed against the head, you see.

28
00:03:03,898 --> 00:03:07,198
But, could it be that he got scared

29
00:03:07,198 --> 00:03:09,298
just before shooting himself and pulled the gun away?

30
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:11,398
I don't think so.

31
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:14,298
See the silencer on the tip of the gun?

32
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:16,098
I think it's impossible to shoot himself

33
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:19,698
with such a long thing attached to the gun.

34
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:22,098
And besides, see, on the sofa opposite,

35
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:24,198
there looks to be a trace of a gun being fired on it.

36
00:03:24,198 --> 00:03:25,398
Huh?

37
00:03:25,398 --> 00:03:29,498
The murderer probably, in order to make it look like a suicide,

38
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:31,198
put discharge residue on the victim's hand and sleeve,

39
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:32,998
made him hold the gun

40
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:34,998
and fired an extra shot.

41
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:38,298
Of course discharge residue would also be found on the murderer,

42
00:03:38,298 --> 00:03:40,198
but it can easily be removed by washing his hands,

43
00:03:40,198 --> 00:03:41,298
and as to his clothes,

44
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:44,098
he probably already threw it out the window.

45
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,798
But, well, it's for sure that the killer

46
00:03:46,798 --> 00:03:48,498
is still on this train.

47
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:50,398
We won't let him get away.

48
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:54,998
For the time being, you guys go back to your room

49
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:56,998
-with Ran and the others. -Huh?

50
00:03:56,998 --> 00:04:00,098
What? We'll help out with something too!

51
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:02,498
-Me too! -Stay out of this!

52
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:05,098
Lock your room until I get back

53
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:08,498
and no matter who comes around, don't ever open the door!

54
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,198
What's that drastic attitude about?

55
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:12,198
You look frightening.

56
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:14,098
Huh? Oh, like I was saying...

57
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:15,498
It's dangerous because a murderer

58
00:04:15,498 --> 00:04:18,298
is still loitering around, you see?

59
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,098
Then, take care of the children, will you?

60
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:22,698
Okay. I got it.

61
00:04:22,698 --> 00:04:25,598
But, I'll call Dad either way and have him come too.

62
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,998
Excuse me.

63
00:04:26,998 --> 00:04:29,198
What's this about, all this fuss?

64
00:04:29,198 --> 00:04:31,198
Don't tell me that the deduction quiz this time

65
00:04:31,198 --> 00:04:32,698
has already started?

66
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:34,898
Oh, no. Rather than a quiz,

67
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:37,798
a real murder seems to have occurred.

68
00:04:37,798 --> 00:04:39,698
A real murder?

69
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:40,798
My, how frightening.

70
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:44,498
A real case is no good. It's too bloody.

71
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:45,998
At any rate, conductor!

72
00:04:45,998 --> 00:04:47,698
Please stop this train right away,

73
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:49,498
and tell all the passengers not to leave their rooms

74
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,798
until the police arrive!

75
00:04:50,798 --> 00:04:52,198
Yes!

76
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,798
Attention all passengers.

77
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:57,798
Since an incident has occurred on board,

78
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,498
the schedule of this train has been changed

79
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:01,198
and we are contemplating whether or not

80
00:05:01,198 --> 00:05:02,698
to stop at the nearest station.

81
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:05,698
We are very sorry to inconvenience you,

82
00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:07,098
however, until further instructions,

83
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,998
please stay in your rooms

84
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:10,798
and try as much as possible not to go outside.

85
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:12,598
What a bad feeling.

86
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:15,198
This bad feeling that I've been having from a while ago.

87
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:18,698
And that attitude of his a while ago.

88
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:21,098
What is this anyway, what's going on?

89
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:36,898
Huh? You're on board too?

90
00:05:36,898 --> 00:05:39,098
-Amuro! -Yes!

91
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:41,398
I was lucky and was able to get myself a ticket, you see.

92
00:05:41,398 --> 00:05:45,398
I met Mr. Mouri a while ago in the dining room too!

93
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:50,198
Hey, Ran, who's this good looking guy?

94
00:05:50,198 --> 00:05:51,898
A detective who wants to be Dad's disciple

95
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:53,998
that I told you about a while ago.

96
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:56,398
Oh, so he's the one.

97
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,998
Hello, I'm Sonoko Suzuki.

98
00:05:58,998 --> 00:06:00,298
Nice to meet you.

99
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:03,298
I hear that something happened on board.

100
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:04,798
Do you know anything about it?

101
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,498
Well, a murder's been committed.

102
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:10,898
Sera and Conan are back at the site right now.

103
00:06:10,898 --> 00:06:12,298
Oh.

104
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:16,498
If so, I would think it best to leave it to Mr. Mouri?

105
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:21,098
It looks to be that the heavens are on our side.

106
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:27,698
What? It won't stop until Nagoya?

107
00:06:27,698 --> 00:06:29,998
I told you to stop it at the nearest station and yet...

108
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:31,198
But, you see.

109
00:06:31,198 --> 00:06:32,598
Just one word from the owner of this train,

110
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:34,398
Advisor Jirokichi Suzuki

111
00:06:34,398 --> 00:06:35,898
and it's no questions asked.

112
00:06:35,898 --> 00:06:37,598
The one who is audacious enough

113
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,298
to commit a murder on board my train,

114
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,498
shall be arrested right before my eyes.

115
00:06:41,498 --> 00:06:44,598
So saying, it seems he's waiting for the train to arrive in Nagoya.

116
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:46,998
I mean, is there any limit to that old man's power?

117
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:49,998
Well, no need for worry.

118
00:06:49,998 --> 00:06:51,998
Before we arrive at Nagoya Station,

119
00:06:51,998 --> 00:06:54,998
I, the renowned Detective Poirot Mouri,

120
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,498
will magnificently pierce through the truth

121
00:06:58,498 --> 00:07:02,098
of this Bell Tree Express murder incident and solve it!

122
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:04,198
Please do so at all costs!

123
00:07:05,998 --> 00:07:07,798
By the way, conductor.

124
00:07:07,798 --> 00:07:11,098
When did you last see the victim, Mr. Murobashi?

125
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,898
It was when I was in front of Mr. Noto's room A.

126
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:19,098
Since I heard the bell, I went in front of room A,

127
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:21,498
and was scolded by Mr. Noto

128
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:23,298
saying that he didn't call.

129
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:26,498
At that time, Mr. Murobashi opened the door of his room

130
00:07:26,498 --> 00:07:28,798
and was shooting glances towards us.

131
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:31,498
Was it really Mr. Murobashi?

132
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:32,798
Yeah.

133
00:07:32,798 --> 00:07:35,398
He seems to have been on the phone with someone though.

134
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:40,798
Okay, shall we go see what Mr. Noto has to say, Poirot?

135
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:43,298
Yeah, right!

136
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,898
Yeah, back then

137
00:07:47,898 --> 00:07:50,798
I also heard Mr. Murobashi's voice through the door.

138
00:07:50,798 --> 00:07:52,998
I was surprised because I didn't think

139
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:55,498
that he was in the room next to mine.

140
00:07:55,498 --> 00:07:58,398
But, why did you lie saying that

141
00:07:58,398 --> 00:07:59,898
you didn't ring the bell when you did?

142
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:02,098
Like I've been saying, I didn't call

143
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:04,198
but the conductor came anyway!

144
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:07,498
But the lamp on top of the door should light up

145
00:08:07,498 --> 00:08:08,698
when you ring the bell,

146
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:10,698
so I don't think he made a mistake.

147
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:15,198
The thing is, the bulb of room A was burned out.

148
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:17,198
So, despite the bell ringing,

149
00:08:17,198 --> 00:08:19,898
none of the lamps of the rooms were lit.

150
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:21,898
I just happened to think it was Mr. Noto's room

151
00:08:21,898 --> 00:08:23,498
so I knocked.

152
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:25,498
And? After that?

153
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:28,698
Right after the door of room A and room B were closed,

154
00:08:28,698 --> 00:08:30,898
the bell rang and the lamp of room E,

155
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:34,598
Ms. Idenami's room turned on so I went over but...

156
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:40,198
Yes. I did ring the bell and called the conductor

157
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:42,998
because I heard strange noises in my room.

158
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:45,998
The sound was caused by the alarm of this wristwatch.

159
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:49,098
I found it stuck between the space of the sofa!

160
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:52,598
I'm sure that the janitor or somebody forgot it here.

161
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,298
That's...

162
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:57,798
If you called the conductor to make him examine the room,

163
00:08:57,798 --> 00:08:58,898
it could be at that time

164
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:01,798
that the culprit entered the victim's room.

165
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:03,498
After all, the conductor guarding the corridor

166
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:04,998
would be gone.

167
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:08,298
Examine? I called him to complain!

168
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,698
I found this on my own a while ago!

169
00:09:10,698 --> 00:09:15,098
I don't like others stomping on my property, you see.

170
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:17,498
Oh. Which means that

171
00:09:17,498 --> 00:09:19,298
although you were in the corridor all the while,

172
00:09:19,298 --> 00:09:20,698
you didn't see any suspicious person

173
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:23,398
go into the victim's room, conductor?

174
00:09:23,398 --> 00:09:25,298
Come to think of it...

175
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,598
When I was listening to Ms. Idenami's complaint,

176
00:09:27,598 --> 00:09:29,898
the door on the very end was opened

177
00:09:29,898 --> 00:09:32,198
and I felt as if somebody was glancing this way

178
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,498
through the door.

179
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:38,098
The room at the very end would be room A.

180
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:41,398
Just before seeing that suspicious person,

181
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:43,698
Ms. Komino who came out of room D

182
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:45,698
with her maid pushing her wheelchair along,

183
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:48,298
went over that way

184
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:50,698
so maybe those two witnessed something.

185
00:09:50,698 --> 00:09:53,198
Ms. Komino, eh?

186
00:09:53,898 --> 00:09:55,898
The door of room A?

187
00:09:55,898 --> 00:10:00,698
When we passed by there, no such door was opened.

188
00:10:00,698 --> 00:10:03,598
Of course we didn't see the suspicious person

189
00:10:03,598 --> 00:10:06,398
who was near the door either.

190
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,298
Isn't that right, Ms. Sumitomo?

191
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:09,898
Yes, ma'am.

192
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:10,998
The only door that was opened

193
00:10:10,998 --> 00:10:13,798
was that of Ms. Idenami's room

194
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:16,398
where she was shouting.

195
00:10:17,298 --> 00:10:20,898
Then maybe the door was opened after Ms. Komino passed by.

196
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:24,298
On the way to room B,

197
00:10:24,298 --> 00:10:26,498
we passed the two old ladies by the door

198
00:10:26,498 --> 00:10:28,998
leading to car number 8.

199
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:32,698
But we didn't see the door of room A open either.

200
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,498
Are you sure it was really opened?

201
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:36,598
Oh, come to think of it,

202
00:10:36,598 --> 00:10:38,298
just before you boys came along,

203
00:10:38,298 --> 00:10:39,698
Mr. Ando in room C

204
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:43,798
came to check things out so maybe...

205
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:47,298
Yeah. Ms. Idenami shouting

206
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,698
could be heard all the way to my room,

207
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:52,498
so I left the room to go check things out.

208
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:54,498
I wondered what all the fuss was about.

209
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:57,698
But, I can't really say if the door of room A

210
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,598
was opened then or not.

211
00:10:59,598 --> 00:11:02,198
After all, it's in a different direction from room E.

212
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:05,398
On top of that, back then, the train went through a tunnel

213
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,298
and there was no light coming in through the window.

214
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:09,498
The corridors were dimly lit too.

215
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:11,998
Come to think of it, that's right.

216
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:14,298
You didn't see anything?

217
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,198
After all, you came along right after I left the room, right?

218
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:19,698
Nope. We didn't see anything.

219
00:11:19,698 --> 00:11:22,998
By the way, you passengers in car number 8,

220
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:26,498
seem to strangely know each other's rooms and names.

221
00:11:26,498 --> 00:11:27,998
But, are you acquaintances?

222
00:11:27,998 --> 00:11:29,598
Yes. Sort of.

223
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:32,998
Every year we all come on board this mystery train, you see.

224
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:34,098
They are our regular customers

225
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:38,198
who reserve this first class car every year, first thing.

226
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,098
Moreover, they all reserve the same room.

227
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:42,798
Oh.

228
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:46,898
Which means, in other words,

229
00:11:46,898 --> 00:11:50,898
it could be that you merely made a mistake, conductor?

230
00:11:50,898 --> 00:11:54,698
No. I'm pretty sure that I saw what I saw.

231
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:56,998
I see, I got it!

232
00:11:56,998 --> 00:11:58,398
You're the one, aren't you?

233
00:11:58,398 --> 00:12:00,898
The one who let the culprit secretly into room B.

234
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:01,898
Huh?

235
00:12:01,898 --> 00:12:03,798
Although you say it's a locked room murder,

236
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:05,698
I'll bet there's a hidden door

237
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:08,498
or something leading to the next room?

238
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:11,198
There is no such door on this train!

239
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:14,398
Then, you gathered the passengers of room A, C, D and E

240
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:15,898
into room B

241
00:12:15,898 --> 00:12:17,298
and you made of all of them

242
00:12:17,298 --> 00:12:20,598
take a shot at the victim one by one, no?

243
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:22,598
What on earth are you talking about?

244
00:12:22,598 --> 00:12:24,998
According to my deduction, that's how it goes!

245
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:26,698
That's ridiculous.

246
00:12:26,698 --> 00:12:30,198
That's the same as that of the Orient Express!

247
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:34,098
I mean, the victim was only shot once.

248
00:12:34,798 --> 00:12:38,598
What? You sent it to the Mouri Detective Agency?

249
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:41,698
You mean the picture of the camp that we went to last week?

250
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:44,498
Yes, because I wanted to thank

251
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:46,598
the lady who saved us back then.

252
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:47,698
So I thought a famous detective

253
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:51,198
would be able to find out who she was.

254
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:52,298
If it's that movie you're talking about,

255
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:54,398
I watched it together with Dad!

256
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,698
It would be difficult to find her just by her voice and face,

257
00:12:56,698 --> 00:12:58,098
but Dad said that if we upload it on the web,

258
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:00,598
somebody may know her.

259
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:03,098
That lady was wearing the pass ring

260
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:04,598
of the mystery train,

261
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:07,398
so we were saying that we may run into her here, right?

262
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:09,598
I haven't seen her yet.

263
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,898
It can't be.

264
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:16,498
What's this uneasy feeling going through me.

265
00:13:16,498 --> 00:13:18,398
It can't be...

266
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,998
It can't be that they...

267
00:13:29,729 --> 00:13:32,429
-"Nagoya Station" -Listen! All of you!

268
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:35,329
As soon as the train arrives, charge on board!

269
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:38,429
Nab the murderer in the flash of lightning,

270
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:40,929
and bring him to me ASAP!

271
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:43,329
Answer me, will you? Answer me!

272
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:45,529
Advisor Suzuki.

273
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:48,729
Please don't give out commands to my men on your own.

274
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:50,329
Please leave this case to us,

275
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,929
-the Aichi Prefectural Police. -What?

276
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:54,129
A train with our name Suzuki on it,

277
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:56,229
was turned into the site of a murder, you know!

278
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:58,629
And you insist that I just sit and wait around?

279
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,529
After the murderer is arrested,

280
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,229
I'll hang him by the neck and suspend him

281
00:14:03,229 --> 00:14:04,829
from the tower of the Nagoya Castle!

282
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:07,229
That's ridiculous.

283
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:10,029
It seems that there was an uncalled for murder,

284
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:13,629
but luck's seems to be turning in our favor, boss.

285
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:16,929
Yeah. After all, that "iron snake"

286
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:20,329
is going to deliver her to us non-stop.

287
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:23,929
I just got word from Vermouth just now.

288
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,229
That she confirmed Sherry in the train.

289
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:30,929
Then, Vermouth and Bourbon are watching her now.

290
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:35,329
I could care less whether they catch her or kill her.

291
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:36,929
The point is whether that lady

292
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:40,129
is in the stomach of the "snake" or not.

293
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,029
Sherry, if you're swallowed by the snake,

294
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:46,829
Nagoya will be last stop.

295
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:53,929
Well, at any rate,

296
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:55,929
in room B, where the victim Mr. Murobashi was,

297
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,029
the door was chain locked,

298
00:14:58,029 --> 00:14:59,029
and if this conductor

299
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:01,329
who was here in the corridor right through

300
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:02,429
while the murder was committed,

301
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:05,629
didn't see any suspicious person go in or out of room B,

302
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:07,529
couldn't this be concluded as Mr. Murobashi

303
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:09,029
having committed suicide?

304
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:11,729
But there were no burns around

305
00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:13,429
the gun shot wound of the temple.

306
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:15,329
On the sofa opposite the corpse,

307
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:18,029
there were traces of a gun being fired, weren't there?

308
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:20,029
All the passengers on this mystery train

309
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:22,029
are mystery lovers!

310
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:23,129
If he was going to die anyway,

311
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:25,629
he deliberately left traces of being murdered

312
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:28,329
and wanted to turn his death into a mysterious one.

313
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:29,429
I see,

314
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,929
just as would be expected of the Sleeping Kogoro!

315
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:35,029
Call me Poirot today.

316
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:37,929
But... that man called Murobashi,

317
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:40,029
switched rooms with Ran and the others

318
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:41,629
and was all for the deduction quiz,

319
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:43,329
cooperating with you, right?

320
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:46,029
Would somebody like that commit suicide?

321
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,329
It seems that the instruction card

322
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:50,729
for the deduction quiz is fake too.

323
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:54,829
True.

324
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,329
It looks exactly like the usual instructions card,

325
00:15:57,329 --> 00:15:59,629
but the contents differ from the trick

326
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:01,029
that we were told of.

327
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:04,429
Just as I thought. Somebody for some reason,

328
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:07,729
moved Mr. Murobashi over to this first class car.

329
00:16:07,729 --> 00:16:08,829
Most probably because

330
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:10,629
Pops and the others came unexpectedly

331
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:12,729
to stay in room B of this first class car

332
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:14,529
that Mr. Murobashi always used to reserve.

333
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:16,029
If so,

334
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:18,829
is it a trick that can only be carried out in this car?

335
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:22,229
Is there anything to this first class car?

336
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:24,029
Huh? What do you mean by anything?

337
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:27,029
Well, the same passengers used to reserve

338
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,729
the same rooms from A to E every year, right?

339
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:31,229
Yes.

340
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:35,129
This Bell Tree Express was completed five years ago

341
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:38,029
but from what I hear, Advisor Jirokichi Suzuki

342
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:39,129
built this first class car

343
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:41,929
because a rich friend of his requested it.

344
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:43,529
Something about his friend

345
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:45,829
being a great fan of the Orient Express,

346
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:48,229
and wanting to relax with his family here.

347
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:49,629
Therefore, he requested only the rooms in this car

348
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:51,129
to be made spacious.

349
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:53,029
Then were all those passengers a while ago,

350
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,929
the family of the rich man?

351
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:56,029
No.

352
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:58,229
I hear that the family, due to a big fire,

353
00:16:58,229 --> 00:17:00,629
a month before the first run, virtually all died.

354
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:02,229
So, there is only one member of the family

355
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,029
among the passengers.

356
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:05,629
Who is that?

357
00:17:05,629 --> 00:17:08,229
Ms. Komino, in room D.

358
00:17:08,229 --> 00:17:09,329
If I remember correctly,

359
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,329
she is the aunt of the rich man who passed away.

360
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,629
That incident is on the web!

361
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:17,329
-Huh? -Because of a fire that broke out

362
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,329
during the birthday party of that rich man,

363
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,629
the people who died back then

364
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:24,529
were his family and 12 guests who were there.

365
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:26,029
It was written that the people who were saved were,

366
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:28,329
Ms. Komino, whose name was just mentioned,

367
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:32,129
her maid, Ms. Sumitomo and four guests.

368
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:33,729
Could it be that the four guests

369
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:36,429
were the ones we just met a while ago?

370
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:37,729
It seems that the fire

371
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:40,229
was due to some kind of electrical trouble,

372
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:43,629
but nothing definite has been found yet.

373
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,929
The murder that occurred this time,

374
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,829
had something to do with revenge for what happened back then,

375
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:49,329
it's sure starting to sound like

376
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,629
that story of the Orient Express!

377
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:53,729
I guess we'll have to go back and ask the people

378
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:55,529
what they have to say about this!

379
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:58,229
Talking about electricity,

380
00:17:58,229 --> 00:18:00,429
why didn't you change the bulb of room A

381
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:02,429
despite it being burned out?

382
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:04,929
Behind this first class car is the cargo car,

383
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:07,729
and spare bulbs are always supposed to be there,

384
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:09,329
but I couldn't find any.

385
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:11,129
Then, are you the one conductor,

386
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:14,129
who checks things out before the train starts off?

387
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:15,729
Yeah, we, the two or three of us,

388
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:16,929
check whether the water of the rooms are okay

389
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,529
or things like that.

390
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:20,029
Come to think of it, I heard that

391
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:23,629
one conductor's uniform was missing from this car.

392
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:30,029
Huh? Is anything bothering you?

393
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:32,529
Oh...

394
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,829
I saw the article about the fire too,

395
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:36,529
but couldn't find out anything yet.

396
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:38,829
Well, why don't we take our time working on this?

397
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:41,429
I'm sure our opponent is panicked too

398
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:43,829
since you can't possibly flee on board a train

399
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:46,329
that's going at a speed of 80km an hour!

400
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:48,529
True.

401
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:55,729
What shall I do

402
00:18:55,729 --> 00:19:00,029
if the Organization has really come after me

403
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:02,729
and is on board this train?

404
00:19:03,729 --> 00:19:07,929
Can't possibly stay here anymore.

405
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:16,529
Mail?

406
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:19,829
An address that I don't know...

407
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:21,229
who is it?

408
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:26,829
Are... are you ready?

409
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:29,029
Vermouth?

410
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:39,629
You got mail?

411
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:42,629
-Who is it from? -Isn't it from Conan?

412
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:45,629
No. It's just some ad mail.

413
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:50,929
Oh, Ai, where are you going?

414
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:52,829
To the restroom. I may be awhile because I'm going to

415
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:55,229
drink my cold medicine too, while I'm at it.

416
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:57,229
I'll go with you...

417
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:02,829
Let her be! You're just a nuisance to her!

418
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:04,329
But, she...

419
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,929
all the way to this room

420
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:08,929
was hanging onto the hem of my top.

421
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:11,229
She looks to be worried about something.

422
00:20:11,229 --> 00:20:13,629
I think it's best that I stay with her.

423
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:17,029
Huh?

424
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:19,929
Ai? Where are you?

425
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:40,329
I'll see you again on your 19th birthday, then.

426
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:41,829
Bye-bye.

427
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:47,629
Oh, and, I think it's about time that I told you.

428
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:53,329
The fact is, mother is making a horrifying drug right now.

429
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:55,629
All the people back at the lab are delighted

430
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,129
that it's a dream drug.

431
00:20:57,129 --> 00:21:01,329
Mom and Dad put our hopes in it and call it

432
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:07,129
the silver bullet!

433
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:09,729
But, in order to complete that drug,

434
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:14,629
Mom and Dad must live apart from you two.

435
00:21:14,629 --> 00:21:18,629
Please understand, Shiho.

436
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:22,129
I'm sorry, Mother.

437
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:25,029
I didn't know

438
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:29,529
that this drug was not supposed to be made.

439
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:33,329
But in order not to get everyone involved,

440
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:36,929
I have no other choice but to rely on this drug right now.

441
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,629
Just as would be expected of you sisters,

442
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:57,429
I can tell exactly what you're bound to do.

443
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:04,229
So, come along with me, to my area.

444
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,129
No, not now.

445
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:17,529
I can't afford to be killed looking like this.

446
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:47,629
Weren't the tools

447
00:23:47,629 --> 00:23:50,029
for the locked room murder trick in there?

448
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:54,329
Will you let me take a movie of you running, Pops?

449
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:56,929
Your maid is a pretty fast runner,

450
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:59,529
but has she been doing any kind of sport?

451
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:03,229
That wristwatch that you said you found in the room,

452
00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:05,429
has it gone off since?

453
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:09,229
I got a glimpse of it when Mr. Murobashi's body was found.

454
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:11,329
