1
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:02,335
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,035
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:05,535
Here comes the popular series.

4
00:00:05,536 --> 00:00:07,135
A coincidental meeting at a social gathering

5
00:00:07,136 --> 00:00:09,035
brings commotion and halt to the love affair of a police officer!

6
00:00:09,036 --> 00:00:10,435
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,436 --> 00:00:12,135
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:13,736
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:00,982 --> 00:02:03,581
I see. You can't come.

10
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:04,781
Too bad.

11
00:02:04,782 --> 00:02:08,981
I'm sorry. Some urgent work suddenly came in.

12
00:02:08,982 --> 00:02:11,781
Don't be. It's work so it can't be helped.

13
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:13,281
That's right.

14
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:16,381
Tell him not to drink too much, will you?

15
00:02:16,382 --> 00:02:18,881
Because I'm not going to defend him

16
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:21,281
even if he gets drunk and hassles a young girl that is within his reach.

17
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:22,881
Okay, I will.﹛.

18
00:02:22,882 --> 00:02:24,582
See you then, mom.

19
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:32,981
What's with that sigh of yours

20
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:36,181
just when we're about to dig in to delicious food?

21
00:02:36,182 --> 00:02:37,481
Because...

22
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:41,181
Did you invite Aunty Eri to come?

23
00:02:41,182 --> 00:02:42,982
Well, sort of.

24
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:46,081
I thought it was something like that.

25
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,881
When you suddenly said, "A fashionable cafe opened, so let's go."

26
00:02:49,882 --> 00:02:51,881
I knew you had an ulterior motive.

27
00:02:51,882 --> 00:02:53,381
Just as I thought.

28
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,781
No kidding.

29
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:56,081
I thought you were all for it,

30
00:02:56,082 --> 00:02:58,081
saying that if it's delicious and inexpensive, let's go.

31
00:02:58,082 --> 00:03:01,381
It was really tough getting reservations for this restaurant.

32
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:05,081
It's not all that bad a place,

33
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:08,181
but I'm sure that some young people use this place for socials and dates.

34
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:10,282
Huh? Mr. Mouri?

35
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:12,681
Hello!

36
00:03:12,682 --> 00:03:13,981
Officer Chiba!

37
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:17,781
Officer Takagi is with you, too!

38
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:19,281
What's this?

39
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,181
Two men coming together to a restaurant like this to eat?

40
00:03:22,182 --> 00:03:23,681
No!

41
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:26,081
We've come here for a social gathering!

42
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:27,181
Idiot! Shoots.

43
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:30,782
Social gathering? Does Officer Sato know of this?

44
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:35,381
Well, I'm just here to match the number of people who will be coming.

45
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,181
Rather, Officer Chiba dragged me over here.

46
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:39,281
Right? Isn't it?

47
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:40,481
Yeah.

48
00:03:40,482 --> 00:03:42,581
Even thought that's true, when you say it that way

49
00:03:42,582 --> 00:03:44,181
it sounds like you're lying.

50
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,182
So please don't tell Officer Sato about this.

51
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:57,981
"Love Story at Headquarters 7 (Part 1)"

52
00:03:57,982 --> 00:04:00,082
Okay, here goes. Another toast!

53
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:04,681
Chiba, you're late!

54
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:07,381
The girls are all here from sometime ago and have all started already.

55
00:04:07,382 --> 00:04:08,981
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,481
Let me introduce you

57
00:04:10,482 --> 00:04:13,281
to my friend from my junior high school days,

58
00:04:13,282 --> 00:04:15,281
the leader of this social gathering, Emoto.

59
00:04:15,282 --> 00:04:16,681
How do you do?

60
00:04:16,682 --> 00:04:18,381
And he is?

61
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:21,681
This is Detective Mouri. I ran into him coincidentally.

62
00:04:21,682 --> 00:04:23,981
I know!

63
00:04:23,982 --> 00:04:25,681
The Sleeping Kogoro, right?

64
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,781
Hello.

65
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:30,181
And he's your friend, or rather...

66
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:31,981
Yeah, my colleague.

67
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:34,382
Nice to meet you, I'm Officer Takagi.

68
00:04:35,982 --> 00:04:39,081
Not really sharp, but I guess it's better than nothing.

69
00:04:39,082 --> 00:04:42,681
He may have a foul mouth, but he's a good guy inside.

70
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,581
Is that so...

71
00:04:44,582 --> 00:04:48,281
You're lucky today, Chiba.

72
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:52,482
There are two cute girls among the girls who are here today.

73
00:04:58,282 --> 00:05:01,281
I'm happy for you.

74
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:05,281
Is one of them your older sister who may be coming today?

75
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:07,081
No.

76
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:10,081
I was told that one of them is an old friend of my big sister

77
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:12,781
and the other one is the best friend of her friend.

78
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:15,181
They both seem to be working for the police force.

79
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,981
-Police force? -Police force?

80
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:19,181
Come to think of it,

81
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:21,781
you used to say that you wanted to be a police officer before.

82
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:23,581
What are you doing now?

83
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:27,281
I'm a police detective, a detective!

84
00:05:27,282 --> 00:05:30,181
Which means that dorky one there is also a cop?

85
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:31,582
Yeah, right.

86
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:35,881
Then, you guys may have met

87
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:38,081
those mini skirt police women somewhere.

88
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:39,581
Mini skirt?

89
00:05:39,582 --> 00:05:42,481
Are you sure those two really worked for the police force?

90
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:44,982
Yeah, this isn't TV.

91
00:05:45,982 --> 00:05:51,082
Who cares because we can't really dress fashionably during work hours!

92
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:53,882
-Yumi? -Yumi?

93
00:05:56,182 --> 00:06:00,181
Officer Takagi and Officer Chiba! What are you guys doing here?

94
00:06:00,182 --> 00:06:03,081
Shoots. So you guys know each other after all.

95
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:04,481
Which means that...

96
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:07,481
The other woman is...

97
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:09,381
Yumi!

98
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:11,381
Hurry and come back.

99
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:14,182
I can't handle those guys alone.

100
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:16,981
Officer Sato,

101
00:06:16,982 --> 00:06:18,781
what brings you here?

102
00:06:18,782 --> 00:06:21,081
Officer Takagi? Officer Chiba, too?

103
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:22,582
And why are you guys here?

104
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:28,181
The atmosphere doesn't look too good, does it?

105
00:06:28,182 --> 00:06:30,081
It's starting to get interesting.

106
00:06:30,082 --> 00:06:31,582
Hey, Pops.

107
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:37,581
So with a moment's delay, I charged for the culprit like this...

108
00:06:37,582 --> 00:06:39,482
And attacked his joints like this.

109
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:43,281
Please let me be the culprit next.

110
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:46,682
Just as expected of Officer Sato, she's caught the hearts of all the men.

111
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:52,581
More than that, the problem is that man.

112
00:06:52,582 --> 00:06:55,581
You also solved the trick to the case the other day too, didn't you?

113
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,182
Tell us about it, tell us about it.

114
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:01,981
It was so easy that I forgot how I did it.

115
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:03,882
Don't be mean.

116
00:07:06,782 --> 00:07:09,381
I guess I'll start heading home.

117
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:11,781
Hey, hey. What're you talking about?

118
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:13,981
This kind of time off doesn't come everyday, you know.

119
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:17,981
But I'm worried about Kouta who is staying home alone, too.

120
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:20,481
Is he your younger brother?

121
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,781
No. He's my cousin who's going to be five years old.

122
00:07:23,782 --> 00:07:26,781
His parents are both on a business trip abroad,

123
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:30,481
so he's staying at our home for now.

124
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:32,181
He'll be fine.

125
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:34,681
You fixed his dinner before we came, didn't you?

126
00:07:34,682 --> 00:07:37,081
Let's go all out today.

127
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,981
I've got work to do, too.

128
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:41,781
Why don't we forget about work just for today?

129
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:44,481
Your body occasionally needs time off, too.

130
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:45,682
Yes.

131
00:07:49,782 --> 00:07:50,782
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,981
Officer Takagi!

133
00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:53,481
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:54,482
No.

135
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:56,981
I really ought to be going home.

136
00:07:56,982 --> 00:07:59,481
Because something strange happened just the other day.

137
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:00,981
Something strange?

138
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:02,981
Things to do with Kouta.

139
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,981
Like the Masked Yaiba battle card.

140
00:08:04,982 --> 00:08:06,981
A battle card?

141
00:08:06,982 --> 00:08:11,581
Yeah. One day, he brought his friends over and showed off his card,

142
00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:14,181
saying it was a really rare card that I've never seen before.

143
00:08:14,182 --> 00:08:17,081
He was saying that a kind man gave it to him.

144
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:19,381
He seems to have been a bearded man with long bangs,

145
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:22,381
who dropped his wallet right in front of Kouta.

146
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:25,681
When Kouta picked it up for him, Kouta was given that card in thanks.

147
00:08:25,682 --> 00:08:30,881
Moreover, that man took Kouta to his residence and served him cake,

148
00:08:30,882 --> 00:08:32,881
then asked him a lot of questions.

149
00:08:32,882 --> 00:08:35,381
What was he asked?

150
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:36,581
According to Kouta,

151
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,481
that man is a fortune teller

152
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:40,981
and asked about the interior of the rooms of our house.

153
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:42,181
For example, about the position of the bed,

154
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:44,281
or what kinds of things there are at the entrance,

155
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:46,781
as well as the birthdays of my younger brother and I.

156
00:08:46,782 --> 00:08:49,681
He also asked where the mails that are delivered are left.

157
00:08:49,682 --> 00:08:51,281
Mails?

158
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:53,881
Kouta told him that I leave my mail in a box inside the closet

159
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:57,781
and that Masashi leaves his on his desk without putting them away.

160
00:08:57,782 --> 00:09:02,482
He told Masashi that it is in a very good position so to leave it as is.

161
00:09:04,482 --> 00:09:08,481
Was there anything important among the mails?

162
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:10,981
No, not as far as I know.

163
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:12,881
I have no idea either.

164
00:09:12,882 --> 00:09:17,081
On top of that, it seems that the guy is a friend of mine, too.

165
00:09:17,082 --> 00:09:19,281
Friend?

166
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:24,481
Maybe he's planning something to surprise me on my birthday.

167
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:26,682
How did you find out that he is your friend?

168
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:31,581
Kouta said there was a phone call while he was eating the cake.

169
00:09:31,582 --> 00:09:35,181
The man happened to be in the bathroom, so the machine picked up.

170
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:38,081
Kouta says that the voice he heard was my voice,

171
00:09:38,082 --> 00:09:39,981
so there's no doubt about it.

172
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:42,481
Then do you have any idea who he is?

173
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,881
Well...

174
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:47,681
I called here and there to gather members for this social gathering.

175
00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:50,681
But I'm sure it's one of them.

176
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:55,181
The man who heard the message rushed Kouta back home.

177
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:59,381
The guy probably panicked thinking that I would find out about him.

178
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:01,781
What was the message about?

179
00:10:01,782 --> 00:10:03,581
Well, it was nothing really.

180
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:08,181
Just that my sister and I are having social gathering here today.

181
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:09,381
What was that?

182
00:10:09,382 --> 00:10:13,182
Which means that the man knows that only the boy is at home tonight?

183
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,581
Please call him right away.

184
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,881
I tried several times but there's no answer,

185
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:21,081
so I figured I should head on home.

186
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:23,181
Yes, I think we should go check.

187
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:24,182
Yumi!

188
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:26,382
She's wasted.

189
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:27,382
Chiba!

190
00:10:27,383 --> 00:10:29,581
Dad.

191
00:10:29,582 --> 00:10:31,182
What is it?

192
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:38,382
Kouta!

193
00:10:39,382 --> 00:10:41,281
Kouta!

194
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:43,181
You're taking it too seriously.

195
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:45,681
The door was locked, too.

196
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:50,181
That man was just asking about furniture placement and birthdays, right?

197
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,281
He could be a Feng Shui fortune teller or something.

198
00:10:52,282 --> 00:10:54,081
That's what the problem is.

199
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:57,981
There are still many people who use their birthdays to unlock their safes,

200
00:10:57,982 --> 00:10:59,681
so that they won't forget it.

201
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:00,682
Right.

202
00:11:00,683 --> 00:11:02,581
If he knows the position of the furniture beforehand,

203
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:04,281
it would be easier to find the safe.

204
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:06,381
Or it could be that he used the mails and postcards

205
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:08,681
as a hint to figure out the numbers to unlock the safe.

206
00:11:08,682 --> 00:11:12,581
And if the culprit cannot find what he is after,

207
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:14,981
the next action he would take is...

208
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:16,381
Officer!

209
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:17,482
Please come!

210
00:11:19,482 --> 00:11:21,481
Look at this.

211
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:23,281
"I have the boy who is your cousin! Prepare 1,000,000 yen!"

212
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,781
"I will contact you later! Blab to the police and I'll kill him!"

213
00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:26,681
-This is... -This is...

214
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:27,982
A kidnapping.

215
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:38,281
I have the boy. Don't call the police.

216
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,981
You're cops, aren't you?

217
00:11:39,982 --> 00:11:41,681
That's true.

218
00:11:41,682 --> 00:11:44,381
Well, I guess it's saving us needless energy.

219
00:11:44,382 --> 00:11:46,581
At any rate, let's get support from headquarters.

220
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:47,881
No.

221
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:50,681
The culprit came in here and took Kouta away.

222
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:53,281
He could still be nearby checking things out.

223
00:11:53,282 --> 00:11:56,681
If any more cops stampede in here, it would be too conspicuous.

224
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,481
Don't use cell phones either because the waves are easily picked up.

225
00:11:59,482 --> 00:12:02,681
Contacting the police will only be after we confirm

226
00:12:02,682 --> 00:12:04,181
that there are no wiretaps or the like.

227
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,681
That's the basics!

228
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:07,781
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:07,782 --> 00:12:09,681
I'm sorry I got carried away.

230
00:12:09,682 --> 00:12:11,381
No, don't be.

231
00:12:11,382 --> 00:12:15,181
The culprit met Kouta once,

232
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:18,181
and is probably Mr. Emoto's friend, right?

233
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:19,981
Yeah.

234
00:12:19,982 --> 00:12:23,781
Then, if you tell Pops about the details back then,

235
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:26,481
he might be able to figure out who the culprit is.

236
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:27,782
Well, I guess so.

237
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:33,281
If I remember correctly, it was Saturday a week ago, wasn't it?

238
00:12:33,282 --> 00:12:34,282
Yes.

239
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:39,581
Kouta was out playing that day and came home a little after 8pm.

240
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:40,582
8pm?

241
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,881
That's pretty late, isn't it?

242
00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:47,082
Yes. I was worried and thought of contacting the police.

243
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:51,981
But he came home looking fine and said,

244
00:12:51,982 --> 00:12:56,381
"I'm sorry. I'll never do it again so don't tell my parents."

245
00:12:56,382 --> 00:12:58,681
So I didn't scold him much.

246
00:12:58,682 --> 00:13:01,881
But I had no idea that he was meeting someone so dangerous.

247
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:05,081
He probably dropped his wallet on purpose and made Kouta pick it up.

248
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:07,781
He then took Kouta to his house.

249
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:10,581
It was then that I happened to leave my message in his answer phone,

250
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,381
saying that we'll be holding social gathering

251
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:15,881
inviting my big sister and her friends.

252
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:16,981
I see.

253
00:13:16,982 --> 00:13:21,681
It seems certain that the kidnapper is a friend of Masashi.

254
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:26,981
He probably asked Kouta about the position of the furniture in the house

255
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:30,181
and broke into the house tonight when both of you weren't home.

256
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:32,981
Do you have any safe in this house?

257
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:35,281
We have nothing fancy like a safe.

258
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,881
We also carry around our bank books and bank cards,

259
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:42,081
so we really have nothing here that is worth stealing. Right?

260
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:43,281
Yeah.

261
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:46,581
In other words, the culprit came into the house,

262
00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:49,081
but didn't find anything worth stealing.

263
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:51,981
So he kidnapped Kouta instead.

264
00:13:51,982 --> 00:13:55,381
And of the people that you invited to the social gathering,

265
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:57,381
do you know who couldn't make it tonight?

266
00:13:57,382 --> 00:14:00,081
Yeah, there are three.

267
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:03,681
The first is Takuji Rokuda, a friend of mine since my childhood days.

268
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:06,881
The second is an under classman in my high school days called Hikiya.

269
00:14:06,882 --> 00:14:11,081
And the third is a man who patronizes the gym that I work for, Mr. Satsuka.

270
00:14:11,082 --> 00:14:13,581
All three of them are not bad people.

271
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:15,381
I can't imagine them kidnapping anyone.

272
00:14:15,382 --> 00:14:18,281
Do you remember what time you called those three people?

273
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:20,781
I called Rokuda a little after noon.

274
00:14:20,782 --> 00:14:22,681
I called Hikiya in the evening.

275
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:26,382
And Mr. Satsuka at around 7pm.

276
00:14:27,582 --> 00:14:29,781
All three of them were called during the time that Kouta was out.

277
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:32,282
That is before noon to 8:00 at night.

278
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:36,981
There's one thing that bothers me though.

279
00:14:36,982 --> 00:14:39,981
If the culprit made such complex preparations,

280
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:43,681
I'd figure he'd steal something deemed valuable.

281
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:49,581
True. If he wanted to kidnap Kouta, he could've done so two weeks ago.

282
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:53,381
That man was concerned about your mail, wasn't he?

283
00:14:53,382 --> 00:14:56,881
Did you have any important mails or documents?

284
00:14:56,882 --> 00:14:59,781
Nothing really that I know of.

285
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:01,281
Post card!

286
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:04,081
That's right! It's the New Year's special prize post card!

287
00:15:04,082 --> 00:15:06,981
I'm sure the first prize for this year was a trip to Hawaii.

288
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:08,181
If he sells it at a ticket cash exchange shop,

289
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:09,882
it would add up to quite a sum.

290
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:13,981
He probably took down the names

291
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:16,082
and the post card numbers of the people he sent post cards out to and...

292
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:20,581
Here. These are the New Year's cards that came from those three.

293
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:22,881
They all won no prize though.

294
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:25,381
Are you sure?

295
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:29,581
Yes. Because I checked all the post cards we received.

296
00:15:29,582 --> 00:15:30,681
Right.

297
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:33,881
Because unlike me, she's all into prizes and lotteries.

298
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:38,781
Talk for yourself. You go around collecting game cards just like a kid.

299
00:15:38,782 --> 00:15:40,082
Collect cards?

300
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:44,281
Just like Kouta, I used to collect Masked Yaiba cards since I was a kid,

301
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:48,281
and still do even now.

302
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,481
I see.

303
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:52,482
That's why he knew that the card Kouta received was a rare card.

304
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:57,281
Well, if you suspect my friends,

305
00:15:57,282 --> 00:15:59,581
1why don't we go over to their house?

306
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:02,681
All three of them should be home because they cancelled the gathering

307
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:04,082
saying they had something to do at home today.

308
00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:08,881
Good idea. Since they're all suspects, let's go and check.

309
00:16:08,882 --> 00:16:10,681
But what if he finds out that you're police officers?

310
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:14,281
We're going to act as if we stopped by on our way back from the gathering,

311
00:16:14,282 --> 00:16:16,081
and we'll keep that we came here a secret.

312
00:16:16,082 --> 00:16:20,081
And if the culprit makes any false moves, we'll nab him on the spot.

313
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:22,981
If the person's not home, he's the culprit.

314
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,881
I'm sure that Detective Mouri's face is already known,

315
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:29,281
so please wait here for contact from the culprit together with Aya and Ran.

316
00:16:29,282 --> 00:16:30,681
Okay.

317
00:16:30,682 --> 00:16:31,782
What about Conan?

318
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:35,681
Yes, I'll take him with me.

319
00:16:35,682 --> 00:16:37,881
Because he notices a lot of things,

320
00:16:37,882 --> 00:16:39,882
and I'm sure he'll throw the culprit off his guard.

321
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,581
Here it is!

322
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:52,082
Room 203.

323
00:16:53,082 --> 00:16:55,381
Is this the first time you've come here?

324
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,882
Yeah, it's the first time to come all the way to his room.

325
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:01,981
Who is it?

326
00:17:01,982 --> 00:17:04,181
It's me, Emoto.

327
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:06,181
I dropped by on my way back from the social gathering.

328
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:07,282
May I talk with you for a minute?

329
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:11,481
What is it at a time like this?

330
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:12,781
Sorry, sorry.

331
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,981
I talked about you at the social gathering and these two...

332
00:17:15,982 --> 00:17:18,781
"Takuji Rokuda (26)" -You guys wanted to see me. Why?

333
00:17:18,782 --> 00:17:21,682
Well, we also play in a band!

334
00:17:22,682 --> 00:17:26,582
But recently his lyrics don't match my melody.

335
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:30,981
I want to hear your songs.

336
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:34,581
This is Conan. Nice to meet you!

337
00:17:34,582 --> 00:17:36,881
Is he your son?

338
00:17:36,882 --> 00:17:37,982
He's my younger brother!

339
00:17:49,582 --> 00:17:51,981
You're pretty good.

340
00:17:51,982 --> 00:17:53,082
Yeah.

341
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:58,381
By the way, what are all these lottery tickets?

342
00:17:58,382 --> 00:18:01,481
They're the year-end lottery tickets that I sent to you.

343
00:18:01,482 --> 00:18:03,381
You'd better check them out good.

344
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,981
It's okay. I'll bet none of them are winning tickets anyway.

345
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:09,781
If you have money to buy so many lottery tickets,

346
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:12,081
why don't you get yourself a better room?

347
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:17,781
Maybe there's something good in that bulging mailbox of yours.

348
00:18:17,782 --> 00:18:19,482
Yeah.

349
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:25,582
Amazing, amazing!

350
00:18:28,382 --> 00:18:30,581
It looks a lot like Chiba's room.

351
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:34,981
I always wanted to be a model, so this is fantastic!

352
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:36,181
"Kadonari Hikiya (25)"

353
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:39,881
How flattering to be complimented by a beauty character like you.

354
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:40,981
So she's only a character to you.

355
00:18:40,982 --> 00:18:43,481
I should've gone to the social gathering, too.

356
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:46,081
That's why I invited you quite persistently.

357
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:49,281
By the way, what was inside the limited edition event pack

358
00:18:49,282 --> 00:18:53,281
of Masked Yaiba cards you asked me to buy and send you?

359
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:56,081
All of them were worth nothing.

360
00:18:56,082 --> 00:18:57,082
How about you?

361
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,381
Me, too.

362
00:18:58,382 --> 00:19:02,781
The super rare Potato Queen platinum card wasn't inside.

363
00:19:02,782 --> 00:19:05,781
What's the limited edition event pack?

364
00:19:05,782 --> 00:19:09,281
It was a one day thing where you could only buy two packs.

365
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,781
It's rumoured that among the seven cards inside,

366
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:15,281
a super rare card that is no longer sold may be included.

367
00:19:15,282 --> 00:19:18,881
The price for those can go over almost 800,000 yen on internet auctions.

368
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:21,081
-800,000 yen? -800,000 yen?

369
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:23,881
Well, cards and figurines are good, too.

370
00:19:23,882 --> 00:19:27,882
But, Hikiya, I'd advise you to look at real women occasionally.

371
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:36,281
Amazing, amazing!

372
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:38,981
I always admired old-time money so much.

373
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:40,881
I'm so overwhelmed.

374
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:42,381
But it's sort of obvious that you're acting it out.

375
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,481
"Yoshikane Satsuka (31)"

376
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:47,481
Which means you have some things like these, too?

377
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:50,281
No, nothing much.

378
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:52,381
Just stuff like a 10,000 yen Taishi bill

379
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:55,782
that have the end numbers 385 (Miwako) which is a homonym of my name.

380
00:19:57,582 --> 00:20:00,581
Well, you should keep that safe without spending it.

381
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:02,981
Although it has no special value.

382
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:04,581
I thought so.

383
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:07,781
Something of value is here, take a look.

384
00:20:07,782 --> 00:20:09,681
Fantastic!

385
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:12,481
The numbers are all matched.

386
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:17,281
You keep buying those rare bills despite going into debt,

387
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,481
that's why your wife runs out on you.

388
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:22,481
Sorry about last time.

389
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:25,581
I sent the 30,000 yen that I borrowed from you with the docs.

390
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:26,781
Did you get it?

391
00:20:26,782 --> 00:20:28,481
Yeah, I did.

392
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:30,881
More importantly, you should start eating properly

393
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:33,481
and come to our gym again.

394
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,581
You looked like you have lost a lot of weight.

395
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:37,282
I suppose so.

396
00:20:40,682 --> 00:20:43,781
So? There are no suspicious ones among them, are they?

397
00:20:43,782 --> 00:20:47,281
Well, there was no man with long hair and a beard.

398
00:20:47,282 --> 00:20:51,481
I'm sure the man was disguised to hide his face from Kouta.

399
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:54,681
You still suspect them? Give me a break.

400
00:20:54,682 --> 00:20:58,281
Kouta was nowhere in the room of the three, was he?

401
00:20:58,282 --> 00:21:02,682
Maybe the voice on the answer phone was of somebody who sounded like me?

402
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:06,881
It's from my sister.

403
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:09,581
Don't tell me the culprit contacted her.

404
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:10,582
Lend me your phone!

405
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,981
Hello, what's up?

406
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:14,981
No, nothing yet.

407
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,181
But something that Kouta was saying bothers me.

408
00:21:18,182 --> 00:21:19,881
What is it?

409
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:21,481
Something about the characteristics of the culprit?

410
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:25,781
No. It's just that when he ate cake at that person's house,

411
00:21:25,782 --> 00:21:28,081
a baseball game seems to have been playing on TV.

412
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:29,681
He said...

413
00:21:29,682 --> 00:21:33,081
It was a super boring game.

414
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:34,881
Super boring game?

415
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:36,581
Baseball games playing this season

416
00:21:36,582 --> 00:21:37,781
are either high school baseball games

417
00:21:37,782 --> 00:21:40,281
or the opening games for professional baseball!

418
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:43,981
Let's have investigators watch the houses of the three,

419
00:21:43,982 --> 00:21:47,081
while we check on the baseball games that were played that day.

420
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,781
Maybe we'll be able to grab clues of the suspect.

421
00:21:48,782 --> 00:21:50,181
Hey!

422
00:21:50,182 --> 00:21:53,381
Do you have to go as far as to make investigators watch them?

423
00:21:53,382 --> 00:21:55,981
It could be that somebody is really just playing a prank.

424
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,781
Kouta could even come home.

425
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:00,681
How can you be so carefree?

426
00:22:00,682 --> 00:22:02,481
A child's been kidnapped!

427
00:22:02,482 --> 00:22:03,881
Abducted!

428
00:22:03,882 --> 00:22:05,781
It's nothing close to a prank!

429
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:09,182
Yeah, I guess so.

430
00:23:43,082 --> 00:23:44,682
"Next Episode" -Kouta?

431
00:23:45,682 --> 00:23:48,081
What happened to your socks?

432
00:23:48,082 --> 00:23:49,882
They look wet.

433
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:52,281
Don't tell me that...

434
00:23:52,282 --> 00:23:53,681
I can't figure it out,

435
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:57,881
the boring baseball game that Kouta was talking about.

436
00:23:57,882 --> 00:24:00,481
Inspector, we've figured out who the kidnapper is!

437
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:03,082
If he refuses to come voluntarily, arrest him without a warrant.

438
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:06,981
Officer Takagi.

439
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:12,982
Next Conan, "Love Story at Headquarters 7 (Part 2)"

440
00:24:28,882 --> 00:24:31,181
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:31,182 --> 00:24:32,981
"A complete game."

442
00:24:32,982 --> 00:24:35,481
Do you often go to social gathering, Officer Sato?

443
00:24:35,482 --> 00:24:37,882
-What's with you, at a time like this? -Well...
