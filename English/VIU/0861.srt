1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:01,823
Koji Haneda.

2
00:00:01,823 --> 00:00:06,423
17 years ago, the four-crowned Shogi master

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,123
took his crowns

4
00:00:08,123 --> 00:00:09,823
and went to the U.S. to participate in a chess tournament,

5
00:00:09,823 --> 00:00:12,123
which he played as a hobby.

6
00:00:12,123 --> 00:00:13,923
But the night before the tournament,

7
00:00:13,923 --> 00:00:16,223
someone attacked and killed him

8
00:00:16,223 --> 00:00:18,823
in the hotel room where he was staying.

9
00:00:18,823 --> 00:00:21,223
The room was ransacked

10
00:00:21,223 --> 00:00:22,723
and it seems that Haneda

11
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,723
had put up quite a resistance against his killer,

12
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:26,723
but the direct cause of his death is unknown.

13
00:00:29,223 --> 00:00:34,123
The cause of death of Amanda Hughes, a wealthy American woman

14
00:00:34,123 --> 00:00:37,123
killed on the same day in another room is also unknown.

15
00:00:37,123 --> 00:00:38,723
Because Amanda was a fan of Haneda

16
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:40,623
and they were on friendly terms,

17
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,323
and because the bodyguard

18
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:46,423
who accompanied Amanda had disappeared since,

19
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:49,723
the bodyguard who she called Asaka

20
00:00:49,723 --> 00:00:52,923
has been sought after as the prime suspect in the case,

21
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:55,523
but his whereabouts are still unknown.

22
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:58,723
"Asaka" -Furthermore, the identity of Asaka

23
00:00:58,723 --> 00:01:00,523
is shrouded in mystery.

24
00:01:00,523 --> 00:01:02,923
None of Amanda's family or friends

25
00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:07,823
seem to know how she came to hire him.

26
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:12,623
Hey, don't you know the guy called Asaka?

27
00:01:12,623 --> 00:01:15,423
I wonder, I've never heard of him.

28
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:18,223
But if the cause of Koji Haneda's death is unknown,

29
00:01:18,223 --> 00:01:21,523
and he's on the list of people

30
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:24,123
who were administered APTX 4869,

31
00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:25,823
then it's highly likely

32
00:01:25,823 --> 00:01:28,723
that he's a member of the Black Organization.

33
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:30,723
Don't you think it's weird, though?

34
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:34,323
If Koji Haneda was killed 17 years ago,

35
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:36,923
why is his name listed two rows below mine?

36
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:38,323
Whoever kept the list didn't list the victims

37
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:40,923
in the order they were killed.

38
00:01:40,923 --> 00:01:44,923
Maybe they were grouped according to their blood types.

39
00:01:44,923 --> 00:01:48,223
And if that drug that I was forced to drink

40
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:50,923
was already around 17 years ago...

41
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:55,823
how old are you now, anyway?

42
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:58,623
How rude.

43
00:01:58,623 --> 00:02:00,923
I told you that I'm 18, didn't I?

44
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:07,723
My parents probably made that drug.

45
00:02:07,723 --> 00:02:10,623
All I did was scrape together the data

46
00:02:10,623 --> 00:02:13,123
that survived the fire and recreated it.

47
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:14,823
Survived the fire?

48
00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:17,223
My parents' lab caught fire

49
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:20,623
and both of them burned to death along with the data.

50
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:22,223
The Black Organization told me

51
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:25,523
that it was an unfortunate accident.

52
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:30,923
Well, the drug that they were actually making me make

53
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:33,023
was a different drug.

54
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:34,623
But...

55
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:39,723
why would they kill a Japanese Shogi player?

56
00:02:39,723 --> 00:02:44,223
He probably just happened to witness them

57
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:47,123
killing the wealthy woman who was in their way.

58
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:49,923
Amanda apparently seems to have had clout

59
00:02:49,923 --> 00:02:52,623
with the FBI and CIA, you see.

60
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:54,223
It seems definite that Amanda

61
00:02:54,223 --> 00:02:57,723
visited Koji Haneda's room once, too.

62
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:01,923
Apparently, Amanda's fingerprints were on the doorknob,

63
00:03:01,923 --> 00:03:06,123
sofa, teacup, plate and fork in Haneda's room.

64
00:03:06,123 --> 00:03:09,423
Maybe they ordered cake and tea from room service

65
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,923
to have afternoon tea or something?

66
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:14,923
The dishes seem to have been smashed and cracked

67
00:03:14,923 --> 00:03:17,023
when the room was ransacked, though.

68
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:21,823
Yeah, shards of plates and cups with Juke, the name of the hotel on them

69
00:03:21,823 --> 00:03:24,323
seem to have been scattered all over the room.

70
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:25,323
Huh?

71
00:03:25,323 --> 00:03:28,523
There's some glass mixed with the utensils.

72
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:30,123
Is it a mirror?

73
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:32,023
There's something written on it.

74
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:34,423
PTON?

75
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:40,323
It probably spelt "Put On Mascara".

76
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:44,323
Just about that time, there was a cosmetics company

77
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:46,823
selling hand mirror with mascara.

78
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:48,723
It turned out to be a smash hit.

79
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:51,723
The phrase "Put On Mascara" was printed on it.

80
00:03:51,723 --> 00:03:54,123
My older sister also had that hand mirror

81
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:56,123
as a keepsake of Mother.

82
00:03:56,123 --> 00:03:59,923
But why was that hand mirror in Koji Haneda's room?

83
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:02,423
Beside, it seems that the wealthy old woman who was killed

84
00:04:02,423 --> 00:04:05,523
was over 80 years old already, too.

85
00:04:05,523 --> 00:04:09,623
Maybe Koji Haneda also got it from his mother.

86
00:04:09,623 --> 00:04:13,523
I guess he would've been concerned about his looks being a Shogi player.

87
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:15,223
What concerns me more than that is this room,

88
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:18,323
which was left messy as is, after being ransacked.

89
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:21,523
This is not the way the Black Organization does things.

90
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:24,023
They always leave things

91
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:25,623
as though nothing had happened.

92
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:30,223
It seems that the wealthy woman's room

93
00:04:30,223 --> 00:04:32,123
was left looking exactly that way, too.

94
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:34,723
It's also written that the faucet of the sink in the bathroom

95
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:36,723
was left with the water running.

96
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:40,523
It's amazing how you gathered all this information, though.

97
00:04:40,523 --> 00:04:44,023
It seems that somebody is periodically uploading this onto the internet,

98
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:46,923
not even giving a hoot of whether it'll be deleted or not.

99
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:49,723
It's almost as if somebody

100
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,223
is asking for this mystery to be solved.

101
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:56,523
But how did you find out that he resisted the attacker?

102
00:04:56,523 --> 00:04:58,623
Several defensive wounds

103
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:01,123
were found on Koji Haneda's arms,

104
00:05:01,123 --> 00:05:03,923
probably acquired when he tried to block the kicks and punches.

105
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:06,923
There were clear marks on his right hand of him

106
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:11,623
having grabbed the small scissors that came with the room.

107
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:14,023
He grabbed scissors?

108
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:17,423
Huh? What about the scissors?

109
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:22,323
Oh, well, this morning, there was a murder at City Okuho.

110
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,423
And the victim seems to have been holding the scissors

111
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:27,823
that I invented firmly in his hand and dead.

112
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:31,923
So, Inspector Megure asked me to come after lunch

113
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:34,723
to explain about the scissors.

114
00:05:34,723 --> 00:05:37,423
Oh, you mean those ridiculous scissors

115
00:05:37,423 --> 00:05:38,923
that make a snipping sound

116
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,823
each time you match the pattern of the scissors,

117
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:42,823
You mean that stuff's selling?

118
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:48,123
Everyone says that the sound is excellently pleasant.

119
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:51,923
Uh, if you don't mind, I'd like to go...

120
00:05:52,923 --> 00:05:57,223
to the crime site, too.

121
00:06:10,523 --> 00:06:12,423
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

122
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:14,723
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

123
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:16,523
The case involving Apotoxin and a hotel.

124
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:18,723
With scissors in hand danger is fast approaching.

125
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:20,523
He sees through the one and only truth.

126
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:22,823
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

127
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:25,623
His name is Detective Conan!

128
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:59,041
"The Same Crime Scene as 17 Years Ago (Part 1)"

129
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,741
Subaru, why?

130
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:07,441
I seem to have made too much meat and potatoes,

131
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:08,941
so I brought you some.

132
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:12,941
No, rather why do you want to go to the crime site?

133
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:14,541
There's something

134
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,441
about that case that interests me.

135
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:20,741
Okay then, let's go over to the site right away.

136
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:21,741
Okay.

137
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:24,741
Oh, you don't have to come along.

138
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:28,041
Huh?

139
00:08:34,141 --> 00:08:38,141
You can stay home alone, can't you?

140
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:39,641
I guess so.

141
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:41,941
You're telling me to stay at home alone

142
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:45,841
and eat the lousy food you made, right?

143
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,341
It's that bad?

144
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:52,941
The vegetables in the cream stew that you shared with us the other day

145
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:55,741
were still raw.

146
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:58,641
I mean it was as if you listening to our conversation through a wiretap

147
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:00,141
and rushed the food you were making over here

148
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:03,941
so that you could get involved in the case, right?

149
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:07,041
Oh, no. No way.

150
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,341
It's just that I'm not such a good cook.

151
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,841
I mean you'd be a great help

152
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:15,941
if you could stew it over again while we're gone.

153
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:21,041
I'm sure that I used to correct ingredients and seasoning, you see.

154
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:36,541
Look after the girl.

155
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,641
I'm counting on you, Camel.

156
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,441
Yes, sir.

157
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:50,341
"Hiyama" -Dr. Agasa. I've been waiting for you.

158
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,441
Uh, you're not alone?

159
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:53,741
Oh, well...

160
00:09:53,741 --> 00:09:58,641
Well, you see. I was also involved in inventing the scissors.

161
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:00,141
I'm a bother here?

162
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,241
Well, in that case...

163
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:06,841
You mean those scissors were that great an invention?

164
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:14,641
The site of the crime was not in the main house but the annex.

165
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:17,841
The victim's been spending most of his time in the annex lately

166
00:10:17,841 --> 00:10:20,641
because he felt insecure in the main house.

167
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:24,841
Those two sure have a robust physique.

168
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:26,941
Are they bodyguards?

169
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:35,141
Oh, Dr. Agasa!

170
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:38,141
Thank you for coming all this way.

171
00:10:38,141 --> 00:10:39,741
No problem.

172
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,841
The corpse is still here.

173
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:49,041
Let me explain.

174
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,841
The victim is the president of a real estate company

175
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:53,841
as well as the head of this household.

176
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:56,541
He is Mr. Kunihisa Hiyama, age 61.

177
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,741
He was bludgeoned to death with a blunt object.

178
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:02,541
It seems he was attacked in another room of this annex

179
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,641
and fled into this changing room in the bathroom,

180
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:09,441
but the perp broke the door down and finished him off.

181
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:12,341
And the scissors that the victim was holding

182
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:15,541
were these with your logo on them, Dr. Agasa.

183
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,341
Can you explain how they function?

184
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:18,441
Oh, they...

185
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:19,841
Wait.

186
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:22,341
You'll hurt yourself if you don't go in carefully.

187
00:11:22,341 --> 00:11:23,941
Shards of glass?

188
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,341
There's a pattern and letters on it.

189
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:34,341
Looks like it matches the cup on the counter.

190
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:39,541
Can we assume that the victim

191
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,741
threw this cup at his killer when he entered the room?

192
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:43,741
Yes.

193
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:46,641
Then the victim attempted to defend himself

194
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:48,841
using these scissors invented by Dr. Agasa

195
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,141
that he used to trim his moustache with to counterattack his assailant?

196
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:54,141
Most probably.

197
00:11:54,141 --> 00:11:56,941
If so, don't you think it's strange?

198
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:58,741
What is?

199
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:01,541
The mop that is behind the victim.

200
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,441
What? Mop?

201
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:07,041
The long-handled mop would be far better for

202
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:10,341
defending oneself against a killer with a blunt object.

203
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:11,941
Then, why the scissors?

204
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:13,441
True.

205
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,241
And who are you?

206
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:18,441
Oh, I'm sorry for not introducing myself.

207
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:22,741
I'm Dr. Agasa's assistant, Subaru Okiya.

208
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,041
Mr. Okiya?

209
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,941
I came today to explain those scissors.

210
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:29,441
Oh, that's right.

211
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:33,341
These scissors apparently make a sound when they're closed,

212
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:35,541
but do they have any recording function?

213
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,841
They don't have such a convenient function.

214
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,441
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,141
I thought he was holding them

216
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:46,241
because he recorded the perp's voice.

217
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:50,241
There's blood on the shards of glass by the entrance.

218
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:52,241
The perp stepped on them, right?

219
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:55,141
Conan! You can't come inside!

220
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,741
If you match the blood

221
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:58,341
with the people who came here,

222
00:12:58,341 --> 00:13:00,141
maybe you'll find the perp?

223
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:02,841
Oh, well. That blood is...

224
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:07,441
What? It belongs to the person who first discovered the body?

225
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:09,141
So, it's not the perp's blood?

226
00:13:09,141 --> 00:13:12,541
No. His name is Mr. Kazunori Senba.

227
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,841
He used to run a candy shop in this neighborhood,

228
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:17,841
but his son and wife

229
00:13:17,841 --> 00:13:21,141
sold the property to President Hiyama without his approval,

230
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:23,741
so he came by this morning to complain about it.

231
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:26,841
If so, isn't he the perp after all?

232
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:29,241
But it's impossible.

233
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,541
Impossible?

234
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:33,241
As you can see,

235
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:37,641
there are iron bars on all the windows of this annex.

236
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:43,341
And those two bodyguards were at the only entrance there is,

237
00:13:43,341 --> 00:13:48,441
frisking any and everyone who entered.

238
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:49,541
They would've known immediately

239
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,341
if someone was carrying a blunt object.

240
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:54,641
They were even using a metal detector.

241
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:57,841
Isn't it possible that something that was at the annex,

242
00:13:57,841 --> 00:14:00,841
to begin with, was used as the murder weapon?

243
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:05,241
No. President Hiyama had a lot of enemies

244
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:06,741
because of his dishonest business practices.

245
00:14:06,741 --> 00:14:08,841
So to avoid being attacked by his visitors,

246
00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:12,441
the only thing that could serve as a weapon was that mop.

247
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:15,241
Nothing else was kept in the annex.

248
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:19,741
Of course, no luminol reaction was found from that mop either.

249
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:22,941
Does that mean that the man was already dead

250
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:25,141
when that man entered the annex?

251
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:26,341
Yeah.

252
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:28,541
After going through a body check,

253
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,741
Mr. Senba entered the annex and called out

254
00:14:30,741 --> 00:14:32,241
but no one answered.

255
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:35,041
So he went into the bathroom since the door was ajar and looked in.

256
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,341
That's when he found President Hiyama lying on the floor

257
00:14:37,341 --> 00:14:38,841
bleeding from the head.

258
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:40,541
He ran over to him

259
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,641
and stepped on the shards of glass at the entrance.

260
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:43,741
He then went back to the entrance

261
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:46,441
and reported this to the bodyguards.

262
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:50,841
And where is that man now?

263
00:14:50,841 --> 00:14:52,141
He's at the main house being treated

264
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,941
for his wound by a woman police officer.

265
00:14:53,941 --> 00:14:55,341
Hey.

266
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:57,941
I'm sorry if I'm mistaken,

267
00:14:57,941 --> 00:15:01,541
but was the water left running

268
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,541
from the faucet in the bathroom, by any chance?

269
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,141
Yes, it seems so.

270
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:09,041
But how did you know?

271
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,041
I thought so.

272
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:15,141
Mr. Akai.

273
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:18,741
Is there something to this case?

274
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:21,341
You've already realized too, haven't you, sonny?

275
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:24,041
It resembles the Koji Haneda murder

276
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,641
that occurred 17 years ago to a tee.

277
00:15:29,641 --> 00:15:34,141
To that case that inspired me to become...

278
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:37,341
an FBI agent.

279
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:46,252
Inspired you to become an FBI agent?

280
00:15:46,252 --> 00:15:48,652
You mean you were already involved

281
00:15:48,652 --> 00:15:51,552
in that Koji Haneda case 17 years ago, Mr. Akai?

282
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:55,552
No, my father was the one who was directly involved.

283
00:15:55,552 --> 00:15:58,152
Then... then, does that mean that your father

284
00:15:58,152 --> 00:16:00,252
was also an FBI agent, too?

285
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:03,652
No, he wasn't an FBI agent.

286
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:05,652
But if you're going to ask me about my father,

287
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:08,352
I'd like you to tell me about

288
00:16:08,352 --> 00:16:10,652
your identity too, sonny.

289
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:11,852
Oh, well.

290
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:14,352
I'll do that after everything is solved.

291
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:15,552
I see.

292
00:16:16,452 --> 00:16:19,252
I think he already knows, though.

293
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:22,152
Hey, hey. What on earth's going on?

294
00:16:24,352 --> 00:16:25,652
"Kazunori Senba (50)" -I thought that I get to home...

295
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,152
"Former Candy Shop Owner" -after my wounds were treated?

296
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:31,252
We... we still have some questions to ask you.

297
00:16:31,252 --> 00:16:33,152
Could it be that he's the...

298
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:34,452
Yes.

299
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,752
He's the one who first discovered the body, Mr. Kazunori Senba.

300
00:16:37,752 --> 00:16:41,352
Oh, you mean the one who stepped on the shards of glass at the site

301
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:43,052
of the scene and got hurt?

302
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:44,552
Yes, that's right.

303
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:49,652
Excuse me, did you step on the glass with your right foot?

304
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:50,652
What?

305
00:16:50,652 --> 00:16:54,952
It seems that you were walking protecting your right foot, you see.

306
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:58,252
No. I hurt my left foot today.

307
00:16:58,252 --> 00:17:01,852
As to my right foot, I got into a car accident last month and broke it.

308
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:03,852
It's the aftereffect of it.

309
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:06,852
Thanks to that, I was in the hospital till last week.

310
00:17:06,852 --> 00:17:10,352
I mean, are you a cop or something?

311
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:13,652
No, he's the one that cooperated with the invention of the scissors

312
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:16,052
that Mr. Hiyama was holding.

313
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:19,352
I wonder if you could recreate the time

314
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:21,452
when you found the corpse?

315
00:17:21,452 --> 00:17:23,952
There's something that's bothering me, you see.

316
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:27,852
Why do I have to talk to you who's not even a cop?

317
00:17:27,852 --> 00:17:30,252
Hey, you know, the scissors...

318
00:17:30,252 --> 00:17:33,152
They have another special function,

319
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,252
so if you did something near the corpse,

320
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:39,252
that function may have been activated.

321
00:17:39,252 --> 00:17:41,752
Right, Doc?

322
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:42,752
Yeah.

323
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:45,052
What... what thing?

324
00:17:45,052 --> 00:17:47,552
I can't tell you what it is yet.

325
00:17:47,552 --> 00:17:49,752
Well, will you please just do what you did

326
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,552
when you first found the corpse?

327
00:17:51,552 --> 00:17:53,052
Huh?

328
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:55,752
Was there such a function?

329
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:01,552
First, I was body checked by these two bodyguards

330
00:18:01,552 --> 00:18:04,252
at the entrance of this annex.

331
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:08,852
And then I opened the sliding door, went inside

332
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:12,052
and waited a while, but since he showed no signs of coming out,

333
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:14,252
I went inside and called out to him.

334
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:16,952
But no matter how long I waited, I got no answer.

335
00:18:16,952 --> 00:18:18,752
Then...

336
00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:23,252
I saw that the door of the bathroom beyond was ajar

337
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:25,352
so I looked inside

338
00:18:25,352 --> 00:18:27,752
and this is what I found.

339
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:29,652
What is it?

340
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:30,952
Oh, well.

341
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:33,252
They wanted to recreate what happened

342
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:35,952
because the special function of the scissor

343
00:18:35,952 --> 00:18:37,152
may have been activated.

344
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,852
And? Since you saw

345
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:44,652
Mr. Hiyama bleeding from the head and crouched,

346
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:47,352
you inadvertently ran over to him, correct?

347
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:48,452
Yeah.

348
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:51,452
Despite the fact that so many shards of glass

349
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:54,052
are apparently scattered all over the floor.

350
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:56,852
Well, when I looked in,

351
00:18:56,852 --> 00:18:59,652
the door was only slightly open, you see.

352
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:03,052
That... that's why when I tried to run over to the corpse

353
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:06,252
I didn't notice the shards of glass and poked myself.

354
00:19:06,252 --> 00:19:07,952
If so, it's strange, no?

355
00:19:09,152 --> 00:19:12,952
Because if the door was almost closed,

356
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,852
when you tried to open the door and go inside,

357
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:18,052
the shards of glass would've been

358
00:19:18,052 --> 00:19:20,552
pushed back by the door.

359
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,752
Besides, if the perp closed the door,

360
00:19:24,752 --> 00:19:26,552
I think that the shards of glass

361
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:28,552
would've been pushed closer to the entrance.

362
00:19:28,552 --> 00:19:30,152
Oh, that's right.

363
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:31,752
My mistake.

364
00:19:31,752 --> 00:19:34,552
The door was wide open like this.

365
00:19:34,552 --> 00:19:36,152
I was distracted by the body

366
00:19:36,152 --> 00:19:39,152
that I didn't even notice the floor.

367
00:19:39,152 --> 00:19:40,852
Really?

368
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:43,252
So... so what?

369
00:19:43,252 --> 00:19:46,052
Are you saying that I'm the one who did it?

370
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,452
Take a good look.

371
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,252
If I punched somebody to the point of making him bleed,

372
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:51,452
I would've gotten blood myself, too.

373
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:55,452
But is there any blood on my clothes?

374
00:19:55,452 --> 00:19:56,952
Huh?

375
00:19:56,952 --> 00:19:59,152
The button on the bottom part of your shirt

376
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:00,852
is not buttoned correctly.

377
00:20:00,852 --> 00:20:01,852
What?

378
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:07,552
Your shirt's not tucked in behind either.

379
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:10,352
Although your necktie's neatly in place,

380
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:11,652
you're pretty sloppy otherwise.

381
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:13,652
Oh, well. This is...

382
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:15,652
I... I just happened to be dressed this way today.

383
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:18,352
At... at any rate, I didn't have any blunt object on me

384
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:20,452
that would serve as a murder weapon!

385
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,052
That's proof that I'm not the perp!

386
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:25,452
This is outrageous. I'm leaving.

387
00:20:25,452 --> 00:20:27,552
Oh, not yet.

388
00:20:27,552 --> 00:20:30,252
Wait. Hold on a second!

389
00:20:30,252 --> 00:20:32,452
Please, Mr. Senba!

390
00:20:32,452 --> 00:20:34,952
Okay, we've finished taking pictures.

391
00:20:34,952 --> 00:20:37,252
So let's retrieve the shards of this cup.

392
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:38,452
I guess so.

393
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:40,152
Did Mr. Senba

394
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:42,552
step on the shards of glass barefooted?

395
00:20:42,552 --> 00:20:45,352
No, he was wearing slippers.

396
00:20:45,352 --> 00:20:47,152
Here as you can see.

397
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:50,852
I see.

398
00:20:50,852 --> 00:20:52,352
So that's the story.

399
00:20:55,952 --> 00:20:58,952
Do those slippers have something to do

400
00:20:58,952 --> 00:21:02,152
with the function of those scissors?

401
00:21:02,152 --> 00:21:03,852
The cracked cup here

402
00:21:03,852 --> 00:21:07,752
is the same as the cup on the counter of the sink, correct?

403
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:08,952
Yes.

404
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:12,352
It seems the Fusae Brand collaborated with a tableware maker

405
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:14,052
to make those cups.

406
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:15,652
Fusae's?

407
00:21:15,652 --> 00:21:19,352
And? Does the cup have something to do with the scissors?

408
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:21,752
Excuse me, please make way for the body.

409
00:21:30,952 --> 00:21:33,052
Sweet...

410
00:21:33,052 --> 00:21:34,452
Scent.

411
00:21:38,152 --> 00:21:41,352
There was a strange smell coming from the body.

412
00:21:41,352 --> 00:21:42,552
Yeah.

413
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,952
There seems to have been some gooey substance

414
00:21:45,952 --> 00:21:48,952
like honey on the wound of the body for some reason.

415
00:21:48,952 --> 00:21:50,452
-Honey? -Honey?

416
00:21:50,452 --> 00:21:54,152
Does the honey have something to do with the scissors?

417
00:21:55,452 --> 00:22:00,052
If not, will you please leave the site?

418
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,652
Hey, are you listening to me?

419
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:05,952
The scissors that the victim was holding,

420
00:22:05,952 --> 00:22:08,252
the cup that fell to the floor and cracked.

421
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:11,752
The scent of honey that was on the corpse,

422
00:22:11,752 --> 00:22:14,252
the faucet with the water running.

423
00:22:14,252 --> 00:22:18,852
How did the perp kill Mr. Hiyama?

424

"Next Episode" -Even if Mr. Senba, who didn't have

425
00:23:44,352 --> 00:23:46,352
a murder weapon on him is not the perp,

426
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:48,052
how on earth did the perp...

427
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:52,352
I guess we've found the murder weapon

428
00:23:52,352 --> 00:23:54,152
we were looking for.

429
00:23:54,152 --> 00:23:56,552
You've figured out who the perp is and the trick he used?

430
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:58,552
Yes, we've figured it out.

431
00:23:58,552 --> 00:23:59,852
Yep.

432
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:01,052
I've bought what you asked for.

433
00:24:01,052 --> 00:24:03,952
The capsule toy, honey,

434
00:24:03,952 --> 00:24:05,752
colored ball and large marble.
