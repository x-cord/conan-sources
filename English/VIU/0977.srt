1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,650
Invest in Goldfish For a Happy Life!

2
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:13,522
Damn you! You tricked us!

3
00:00:13,762 --> 00:00:16,501
What you did was swindle us!

4
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:19,032
Give us back our money!

5
00:00:19,662 --> 00:00:24,221
Swindle? Don't make such disreputable accusations.

6
00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:30,041
You entrusted our company with your precious money after signing a contract with us.

7
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:34,042
You're lying! You never intended to return our money!

8
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:36,822
Invest in goldfish, huh?

9
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:42,321
I'll kill you! I swear I'll kill you!

10
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:44,652
Step back. Step back, please.

11
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:47,272
Please calm down, Kitamura-san.

12
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:52,691
I'm sorry, everyone, but please leave for the day.

13
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:55,842
We'll get in touch with you at a later date.

14
00:01:06,262 --> 00:01:10,212
Nozomi. I'm almost finished with work. Wait outside.

15
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:11,162
Okay.

16
00:01:12,932 --> 00:01:18,592
As you saw, those people come every day.

17
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,901
Lately I've been fearing for my personal safety.

18
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:27,102
I see. That's why you hired me to be your bodyguard.

19
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:32,102
President Tsuchida, do your actions not violate the law?

20
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,512
The law?

21
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:39,071
It's their fault for being greedy and handing over their money.

22
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,112
What do you think? I'll pay you generously.

23
00:01:43,492 --> 00:01:44,702
Let's go, kid!

24
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:46,532
Mori-san!

25
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:48,042
You've misjudged me!

26
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:53,172
Mori Kogoro isn't rotten enough to sell his soul to the devil!

27
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:06,791
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

28
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:08,581
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

29
00:02:08,582 --> 00:02:10,431
A crooked company president is practically a conman!

30
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:12,411
Incurring someone's hatred leads to a case!

31
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:14,031
Always determining the one truth

32
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:15,731
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

33
00:02:15,732 --> 00:02:18,112
his name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:57,082 --> 00:03:59,242
"The Broken Fishbowl"

35
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,212
Mister, that was cool of you.

36
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:12,703
"I'm not rotten enough to sell my soul to the devil!"

37
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,203
I'm always cool.

38
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:21,203
Anyway, the bus sure is late.

39
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:25,432
The job sucked, and the bus isn't coming.

40
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,043
It's one misfortune after another.

41
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,593
Give me a break.

42
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:36,553
What was that?!

43
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:50,323
What's wrong?

44
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,743
Th-That...

45
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,493
It's no use. He's dead.

46
00:05:07,593 --> 00:05:10,282
They used a statue wrapped in a towel.

47
00:05:10,283 --> 00:05:11,253
Yeah.

48
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,103
They prevented the victim's blood from getting on them.

49
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:17,802
This towel...

50
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:18,553
Hey.

51
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:20,933
Over there, too.

52
00:05:27,153 --> 00:05:28,313
It's no use.

53
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:32,023
I don't believe it. Two of them...

54
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:34,443
Yuto-san!

55
00:05:35,223 --> 00:05:37,982
No... Yuto-san...

56
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:39,343
Stay back.

57
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:43,823
No! Yuto-san! Yuto-san!

58
00:05:53,863 --> 00:05:56,063
Hello? Yes.

59
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,183
Goldfish?

60
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:09,332
Yes, goldfish.

61
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:15,052
The victim President Tsuchida lied about importing rare goldfish from abroad,

62
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:17,703
and gathered a large sum of money.

63
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:20,453
In other words, he was running an investment scam.

64
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:25,012
Yes. The investors were furious.

65
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:28,463
I believe the culprit may be one of his clients.

66
00:06:28,673 --> 00:06:30,752
Got it, Mori-kun.

67
00:06:30,753 --> 00:06:33,342
We'll follow that lead.

68
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:34,103
Yes, sir.

69
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:37,752
Hey, kid! Don't come in here.

70
00:06:37,753 --> 00:06:39,513
Sorry.

71
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,612
Jeez.

72
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:43,263
Oh, Inspector.

73
00:06:43,693 --> 00:06:46,502
This is his office worker Nagase Ayako-san.

74
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:49,023
You were the first one to discovered the bodies.

75
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:50,073
Yes.

76
00:06:50,074 --> 00:06:53,373
When I returned after buying the items the president requested,

77
00:06:54,103 --> 00:06:55,522
President Tsuchida was...

78
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:57,702
Then there's Makimura Nozomi-san.

79
00:06:57,703 --> 00:07:02,033
She was the girlfriend of the other victim Kajiura-san.

80
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:06,043
At the time of the murders, where were you?

81
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:09,053
Waiting outside for Yuto-san.

82
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:12,543
That's when I heard a scream.

83
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:16,923
Whoa!

84
00:07:17,423 --> 00:07:19,603
Miss, use this.

85
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:20,933
Thank you.

86
00:07:22,573 --> 00:07:23,263
Are you okay?

87
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:24,803
Yeah.

88
00:07:24,993 --> 00:07:27,612
Why don't you rest in the other room?

89
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:32,943
It's all right. I'd like to help with the investigation.

90
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:38,412
But even if the president Tsuchida-san had incurred the hatred of his clients,

91
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:40,412
why kill Kajiura-san, too?

92
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:42,052
Let go!

93
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:43,953
I have nothing to do with this!

94
00:07:47,203 --> 00:07:49,583
What's going on, Takagi-kun?

95
00:07:49,823 --> 00:07:54,583
They were in the building, so I had them come as potential witnesses.

96
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:58,682
This is Kitamura Mitsuru-san, the proprietor of Kitamura Hardware,

97
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:01,263
and housewife Bando Atsuko-san.

98
00:08:02,063 --> 00:08:03,013
You!

99
00:08:03,543 --> 00:08:05,763
Damn you! You tricked us!

100
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,812
What you did was swindle us!

101
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:11,273
Give us back our money!

102
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:12,532
Yes.

103
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:16,903
I heard they were related to President Tsuchida's goldfish investment.

104
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:23,783
And 30 minutes earlier when the murders occurred,

105
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:28,842
Kitamura-san was at a bicycle parking lot near this building.

106
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:32,793
Yeah, I parked my scooter there.

107
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:36,222
When I tried to leave, I found that my tire was flat.

108
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:38,793
I called a bike shop and was waiting for them.

109
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:41,542
Can anyone verify that?

110
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:42,803
No!

111
00:08:43,213 --> 00:08:45,303
Bando-san, how about you?

112
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:47,143
Me?

113
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:49,833
I...

114
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:52,882
In other words, neither of you have alibis,

115
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:56,812
but you have clear motives.

116
00:08:56,813 --> 00:09:00,392
Motive? In that case, let me be clear!

117
00:09:00,393 --> 00:09:04,582
Tsuchida took the entirety of my store's working capital!

118
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,703
That trash deserved to be killed!

119
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:11,972
I had all my son's tuition money taken from me!

120
00:09:11,973 --> 00:09:14,333
It's only natural that he was killed!

121
00:09:14,523 --> 00:09:17,562
But I swear I didn't do it!

122
00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:20,002
Me neither! I have nothing to do with this!

123
00:09:20,003 --> 00:09:25,763
In the first place, did anyone see me at the crime scene?

124
00:09:26,363 --> 00:09:27,513
Well?

125
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:32,973
See? I've got nothing to do with this!

126
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:38,733
But I was waiting for Yuto-san at the convenience store parking lot

127
00:09:38,893 --> 00:09:41,253
across from this building.

128
00:09:41,403 --> 00:09:46,222
I think I saw someone through the window while I was there.

129
00:09:46,223 --> 00:09:48,243
You saw someone through the window?

130
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:52,212
Yes, someone heading towards the president's office.

131
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:56,003
The president's office! That's where President Tsuchida was murdered.

132
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:58,762
Was it a man or a woman?

133
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:01,013
It was too far to see that much.

134
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:04,513
Besides, it may have just been my mistake.

135
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,133
That's it!

136
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:10,013
What is it, Mori-kun?

137
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:12,622
Inspector, I've got it.

138
00:10:12,623 --> 00:10:16,802
I know how the culprit entered the office

139
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:21,433
and why they had to kill Kajiura-san after killing President Tsuchida.

140
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:27,223
First the culprit entered through the front entrance.

141
00:10:27,723 --> 00:10:31,412
They crossed the window facing the convenience store

142
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:33,333
and headed towards the president's office.

143
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,143
We know that from Nozomi-san's testimony.

144
00:10:38,623 --> 00:10:42,793
When the culprit entered the president's office at the end of the hallway,

145
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:49,843
they bludgeoned the detestable President Tsuchida with all their rage.

146
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:54,932
They tried to flee immediately.

147
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:57,933
But that's when another tragedy occurred.

148
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:05,942
Yes, they were discovered by Kajiura-san,

149
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:07,873
who entered from the main office.

150
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:12,323
The culprit rushed at Kajiura-san

151
00:11:12,563 --> 00:11:17,153
and used their knife to kill the fleeing Kajiura-san in this office.

152
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:31,973
Huh?

153
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:36,513
I see. Which means Kajiura-san was...

154
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:40,202
Killed because he happened to see the culprit.

155
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:42,773
In other words, collateral damage.

156
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,783
Collateral damage? N-No...

157
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:06,303
Oh?

158
00:12:07,613 --> 00:12:09,352
What's wrong, ma'am?

159
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,803
Isn't this boy sick?

160
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:14,432
This boy? You mean the goldfish?

161
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:19,502
Yes. This boy can't be put in a tank with other goldfish.

162
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:24,443
I'm sorry. I put him in there since his tank was broken.

163
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:28,443
Then there must have been medicine in the broken tank.

164
00:12:28,683 --> 00:12:29,973
Medicine?

165
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:33,674
That over there. A disinfectant.

166
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:35,175
Disinfectant?

167
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:37,758
Ma'am, you know a lot about goldfish.

168
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,258
I sure do. I've loved them since I was a child.

169
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:45,919
Maybe that's why I fell for this investment scam.

170
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:50,889
Invest in Goldfish For a Happy Life!

171
00:12:58,731 --> 00:13:00,081
Bando Atsuko-san,

172
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:04,091
your alibi has been verified.

173
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:07,090
What? My alibi?

174
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:08,210
Yes.

175
00:13:08,211 --> 00:13:09,280
While gathering information,

176
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:13,101
we heard you were borrowing money at a friend's house when the murders took place.

177
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:14,770
Yes.

178
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:19,101
The truth is, I was too embarrassed to say anything.

179
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:24,941
Jeez. But now you're innocent, which means...

180
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:26,390
M-Me?

181
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:29,260
You said you'd kill him.

182
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:31,321
No! I didn't do it!

183
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:33,240
About that.

184
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:35,400
It was difficult to read beneath the blood,

185
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:40,211
but on the towel discovered in the president's office...

186
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:45,040
Isn't this the name of the store you operate?

187
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,420
It's damning evidence.

188
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:49,381
You killed President Tsuchida?

189
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:53,181
No! I didn't kill Tsuchida!

190
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:55,090
We'll discuss this at the station.

191
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:55,681
What?

192
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:57,750
Could you come with us?

193
00:13:57,751 --> 00:14:00,441
I don't know anything! I didn't do it!

194
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:01,401
It wasn't me!

195
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:03,640
Hey, Detective Takagi.

196
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:06,210
That towel was wet, wasn't it?

197
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:08,441
Do you know what the water was?

198
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:10,840
It was ordinary water.

199
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:14,301
But there was a type of disinfectant mixed into it.

200
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:16,621
A disinfectant...

201
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:20,690
I didn't do it!

202
00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:23,331
Yes, we understand. Now come this way...

203
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:39,021
Hold on, everyone.

204
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:44,271
There it is, Mori-san! Has your deduction so far been incorrect?

205
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:49,281
What? No. There was just one thing I wanted to confirm.

206
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:52,781
Confirm? What do you mean, Mori-kun?

207
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:59,271
Yes. Every crime has a motive, an order, and a result.

208
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:03,921
Yes, if you approach this case normally,

209
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:07,171
the culprit must've hated President Tsuchida.

210
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,801
It's the reason he was killed,

211
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,671
why Kajiura-san got caught up in it,

212
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:18,781
and why the culprit is Kitamura-san.

213
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:25,191
Considering the towel left at the crime scene, that's a reasonable deduction.

214
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:26,121
Yes.

215
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:32,690
But what if the truth was the opposite of every reasonable deduction?

216
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:33,821
The opposite?

217
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:36,071
What do you mean, Mori-kun?

218
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:42,920
First, the true culprit stole a towel embroidered with the name of Kitamura-san's shop

219
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:47,601
and punctured his scooter's tire so he wouldn't have an alibi.

220
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:53,341
After entering the company's office, they first headed to the main office.

221
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,120
They went to the main office first?

222
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:58,021
Yes.

223
00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:03,080
Once they were invited inside,

224
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:06,191
they killed Kajiura-san with a knife.

225
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:20,991
Next they headed to the president's office, where they killed President Tsuchida.

226
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:31,301
Naturally, they left the stolen towel in order to frame Kitamura-san.

227
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:35,170
After committing both murders,

228
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:39,051
they returned to the front entrance and left the office.

229
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:44,770
Hold on, Mori-kun. Do you have any evidence?

230
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:49,021
Of course. First, there's the location where Kajiura-san collapsed.

231
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:54,731
If Kajiura-san was attacked by and fled from the culprit leaving the president's office,

232
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:58,531
he should have collapsed in the opposite direction.

233
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:04,500
Then there's the towel discovered in the president's office.

234
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:05,900
Detective Takagi.

235
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,000
Y-Yes?

236
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:12,251
When it was discovered, the towel was wet not only with blood, but also water.

237
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:14,571
Have you determined its exact composition?

238
00:17:15,341 --> 00:17:20,801
According to the forensic report, it was water mixed with a disinfectant.

239
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:24,421
Could this be that disinfectant?

240
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,021
It's for fish.

241
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:33,271
Yes. In the main office was a small tank in addition to the large one.

242
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,281
It was for a goldfish that had become sick.

243
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:43,781
Kajiura-san knocked one of them over, and the water spilled on the culprit as well.

244
00:17:44,671 --> 00:17:49,411
That's why disinfectant was found on the culprit's towel.

245
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:53,840
If they had killed Kajiura-san after killing President Tsuchida,

246
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:57,301
there would be no fish tank water on the towel.

247
00:17:57,521 --> 00:17:58,801
I see.

248
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:04,800
They probably brought with them the knife they used to kill Kajiura-san,

249
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:09,471
but the sculpture they used to kill Tsuchida was already in the president's office.

250
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:15,561
If they truly did intend to kill President Tsuchida,

251
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:19,071
instead of leaving the knife in Kajiura-san's body,

252
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:22,570
they would have used it to kill the president as well.

253
00:18:22,571 --> 00:18:24,680
Hold on, Mori-kun.

254
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:26,700
Doesn't that mean...

255
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,780
In other words,

256
00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:33,461
the true culprit's intended target was not President Tsuchida, but Kajiura-san.

257
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:35,211
Yuto-san?

258
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:38,730
And in order to hide their true intention,

259
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:44,220
the culprit murdered President Tsuchida, who was hated by everyone.

260
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:47,491
But what about Nozomi-san's testimony?

261
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:54,210
Yes. I saw someone heading to the president's office through the window.

262
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:58,481
What if that testimony were a calculated lie?

263
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:00,830
A calculated lie?

264
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:04,741
Yes, one meant to mislead us.

265
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:10,240
Makimura Nozomi-san, you're the true culprit!

266
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:11,470
What?

267
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:13,590
I killed Yuto-san?

268
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:17,191
No! That's not possible!

269
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:23,761
Conan told me. You don't have a handkerchief, do you?

270
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:29,971
When you killed Kajiura-san, did you use it to prevent his blood from getting on you?

271
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:32,611
Have you already disposed of it somewhere?

272
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:38,171
And the area around your hips is stained, isn't it?

273
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,650
That stain is from that.

274
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:43,491
Conan!

275
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:44,991
Here.

276
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:49,411
It's from these letters. It happened then.

277
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:53,000
Yuto-san! Yuto-san! Yuto-san!

278
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:53,411
You mustn't!

279
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:57,221
Your body was wet with water then.

280
00:19:58,101 --> 00:20:02,601
That's why the letters on this poster bled and stained your clothes.

281
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:07,760
The true culprit was soaked by the water in the fish tank.

282
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:12,061
If disinfectant were discovered on her clothes...

283
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:14,310
That would put her at the crime scene.

284
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:15,221
Yes.

285
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:21,181
Nozomi-san, that is the definitive evidence that proves you're the true culprit!

286
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:25,511
Get the forensics team. Have them examine her clothes.

287
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:28,500
Could it be?

288
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:30,951
But why kill Kajiura-san?

289
00:20:32,341 --> 00:20:36,841
I gave Kajiura-san everything.

290
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:41,651
Before he got a job, for years and years.

291
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:46,450
But once he began working for President Tsuchida,

292
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:48,471
he started making a lot of money.

293
00:20:49,251 --> 00:20:53,681
Then he said he didn't love me anymore.

294
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:59,031
On top of that, he told me to leave.

295
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:02,921
He hit me and kicked me.

296
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:11,491
So I took revenge so I wouldn't get caught.

297
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:18,251
That's enough!

298
00:21:19,251 --> 00:21:23,001
That doesn't make it right to kill someone!

299
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:30,391
And killing a bystander in order to conceal your guilt is absolutely atrocious!

300
00:23:05,231 --> 00:23:07,770
Mister, that was cool of you.

301
00:23:07,771 --> 00:23:11,781
I'm impressed you realized the target was the other person.

302
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:15,711
That was a piece of cake for me.

303
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:20,291
Not that I remember it very well.

304
00:23:20,841 --> 00:23:22,911
Anyway, the bus is late.

305
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:26,641
Huh? To Beika City?

306
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:30,660
Are we at the wrong bus stop?

307
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:33,920
Oh, no! We're at the wrong one!

308
00:23:33,921 --> 00:23:36,891
Mister, pull yourself together!

309
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:39,690
Wait!

310
00:23:39,691 --> 00:23:42,831
Stop!
