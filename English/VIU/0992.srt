1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,639
Anyway, their donuts are made with soy pulp,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,980
so they're low sugar.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,699
Not only that, but they look amazing.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,349
But aren't they fried in oil?

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,740
Won't it make us fat?

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,969
They've got holes in the middle. We'll be fine.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,750
They said they're low calorie since they're low sugar.

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,250
Eat too much of anything, and you'll still get fat.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,250
We've arrived.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,880
Well? Pretty tasteful, right?

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,839
Find the question that solves the mystery!

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,969
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

13
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,789
A fashionable café known for its donuts!

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,399
What shocking truth will the high school detective reveal?

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,729
Always determining the one truth

16
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,749
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,190
his name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Murder at the Townhouse Café

19
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:37,427
Wow.

20
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:39,447
What a pretty yard.

21
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:42,687
Seriously.

22
00:02:42,977 --> 00:02:44,226
It's beautiful.

23
00:02:44,227 --> 00:02:45,696
Yeah.

24
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:50,567
A place like this is sure to look amazing!

25
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,867
I know, right?

26
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:59,826
Our staff member Sakai takes great care of our yard.

27
00:02:59,827 --> 00:03:02,867
It's truly impressive. I'm proud of it.

28
00:03:03,297 --> 00:03:06,396
Yes, it really is wonderful.

29
00:03:06,397 --> 00:03:07,936
Thank you.

30
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:08,877
Excuse me.

31
00:03:09,237 --> 00:03:11,257
Mister, do you work here?

32
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:13,326
Ah, my apologies.

33
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:16,436
I'm Tomita, the manager.

34
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:19,466
I'll show you to your seats.

35
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,817
This way, please.

36
00:03:21,997 --> 00:03:24,767
What should we get?

37
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:27,526
Didn't we come here to eat donuts?

38
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:30,437
Of course we'll eat donuts as well.

39
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:32,457
What can I get you?

40
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:37,876
What do you recommend?

41
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:41,947
Our soy pulp donuts are our number one item.

42
00:03:42,397 --> 00:03:47,957
They're low sugar and made to order, so you can enjoy them fresh.

43
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:56,457
But judging by the state of things, this place's popularity suddenly spiked and waned.

44
00:03:56,947 --> 00:03:57,597
Sir.

45
00:03:58,157 --> 00:04:00,536
I brought the soy pulp out of the storage room.

46
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:02,327
Thank you.

47
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:07,516
All right. I've decided.

48
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:10,656
I'd like a hot Darjeeling tea.

49
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:14,906
Also, one shibazuke and cream donut, two matcha and mayo donuts,

50
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:20,226
two chocolate dream donuts, one plain donut, and one molasses crepe parfait.

51
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,257
How about you, Ran?

52
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:24,117
I'll have the same thing.

53
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,356
What? The same thing?

54
00:04:26,357 --> 00:04:29,176
Conan-kun, you'll have orange juice, right?

55
00:04:29,177 --> 00:04:30,537
Uh, yeah.

56
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:32,906
Thank you for waiting.

57
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:34,917
Wow, they're beautiful!

58
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:36,686
They look delicious.

59
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:39,056
Don't you agree, Ran?

60
00:04:39,057 --> 00:04:43,717
Yeah, but we may have ordered too much.

61
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:47,687
Let's dig in!

62
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:50,316
Sakai, I'm counting on you.

63
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:50,977
Yes, sir.

64
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:52,606
Thanks.

65
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,026
Understood.

66
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,247
Conan-kun?

67
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:57,626
Is something wrong?

68
00:04:57,627 --> 00:05:01,486
No. I'm not sure which to eat.

69
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:03,966
Then how about this one?

70
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:06,406
I had a bite, but it's good.

71
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:10,747
Isn't that the donut you just ate?

72
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:13,847
Say, "Ah."

73
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:18,757
An indirect kiss...

74
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:21,387
Right? Good, isn't it?

75
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:23,637
Yeah.

76
00:05:29,757 --> 00:05:32,096
These are lighter than expected, don't you think?

77
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:34,397
Yeah. I could eat these forever.

78
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:41,816
There's sourness and saltiness behind the sweetness, too.

79
00:05:41,817 --> 00:05:42,487
Yeah.

80
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:53,916
The sound of frying donuts really whets the appetite, doesn't it?

81
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:55,147
Hey.

82
00:05:55,977 --> 00:05:57,326
What is it, Sonoko?

83
00:05:57,327 --> 00:06:00,427
Ran, doesn't he seem kind of suspicious?

84
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:04,726
You're right.

85
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:07,877
He keeps looking around everywhere. He seems restless.

86
00:06:08,357 --> 00:06:11,767
And doesn't that customer seem odd, too?

87
00:06:12,617 --> 00:06:17,527
It's more like he's observing donuts, not eating them.

88
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:21,897
There isn't a single decent customer in this place.

89
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:26,486
What was that beeping sound?

90
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:28,537
I heard it, too.

91
00:06:32,507 --> 00:06:34,667
I'll take your empty plates.

92
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:39,047
I'm stuffed.

93
00:06:39,257 --> 00:06:40,946
I can't eat anymore.

94
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:42,806
You ate too much, Sonoko.

95
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:45,547
Speaking of eating too much, it looks like he did, too.

96
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:48,206
He's having a pretty rough time.

97
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,567
I wonder if he'll make it to the bathroom.

98
00:06:55,617 --> 00:06:58,376
Anyway, those were pretty good.

99
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:02,186
They seemed pretty high-level for low sugar donuts.

100
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:03,976
But they're still fried.

101
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:06,406
Should we have eaten that much?

102
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:10,097
We'll be fine. That's why they're low sugar, right?

103
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:11,957
What was that?

104
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:15,327
Conan-kun?

105
00:07:19,717 --> 00:07:20,776
What's wrong?

106
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:22,547
I-It's an emergency.

107
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:24,167
The manager...

108
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:27,027
Are you all right?

109
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:28,927
Sir?

110
00:07:29,217 --> 00:07:31,476
Kid, what's going on?

111
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:33,926
The manager collapsed in the bathroom.

112
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:34,977
What?

113
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:36,727
Was he struck?

114
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:40,357
The weapon was probably that mop.

115
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:45,357
The culprit used those gloves on the ground to avoiding leaving fingerprints behind.

116
00:07:46,387 --> 00:07:47,666
Or could it be...?

117
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,966
In any case, let's call an ambulance and the police.

118
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:51,867
You're right.

119
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:58,997
The victim is Tomita Satoshi-san, the owner of this café.

120
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:04,527
He was struck on the back of the head with a blunt object while in the café's bathroom.

121
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:09,706
At that time, these people were inside the café.

122
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:11,256
You girls again?

123
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,637
Sorry.

124
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:16,397
Could you tell us your names?

125
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:18,147
Yes.

126
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:21,296
My name is Sakai Chitose. I'm a student.

127
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:24,027
As you can see, I work here part-time.

128
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:27,166
My name is Furukawa Yoshihisa.

129
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:30,396
I happened to be having tea here.

130
00:08:30,397 --> 00:08:33,657
There's nothing suspicious about me.

131
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:36,096
My name is Nonaka Kenji.

132
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:39,146
I operate a café in this neighborhood.

133
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:42,137
That's right. Come to think of it,

134
00:08:42,927 --> 00:08:47,356
you always come to scout out our café and steal our recipes, don't you?

135
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:49,706
What are you talking about?

136
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:54,016
My recipes are the product of my own creativity.

137
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:56,076
No one cares about that.

138
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:01,187
You gathered us here because you think one of us is the culprit, don't you?

139
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,316
We haven't said that yet.

140
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:06,686
We just thought we'd ask you some questions.

141
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:10,886
For someone to attack the manager in the bathroom,

142
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:15,336
they would've had to pass through this café where you could have seen them, correct?

143
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:16,707
Yes.

144
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:21,117
The only person who left this room while the manager was in the bathroom was...

145
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:23,237
Nonaka-san, I think.

146
00:09:23,717 --> 00:09:25,916
H-Hold on.

147
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:27,257
I didn't do it.

148
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,056
But you're the only one who left his seat.

149
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:34,636
I just happened to go the bathroom then.

150
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:39,186
More importantly, Furukawa is way more suspicious than me.

151
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:42,247
He seemed nervous and had been behaving oddly since he entered the café.

152
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:46,906
I-I'm not nervous.

153
00:09:46,907 --> 00:09:49,666
Now, now. Calm down.

154
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,937
Tell us one at a time.

155
00:09:52,237 --> 00:09:55,827
What you did after the manager went to the bathroom.

156
00:09:56,277 --> 00:09:59,567
I was frying donuts in the kitchen.

157
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:03,087
I never visited the tables during that time.

158
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:08,087
Come to think of it, we heard the donuts frying.

159
00:10:08,387 --> 00:10:12,787
I-I was at my table the whole time.

160
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:16,597
Everyone here should've seen me.

161
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:19,036
Is that true?

162
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:22,616
Yes, we saw him.

163
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:24,607
Nonaka-san, how about you?

164
00:10:24,997 --> 00:10:26,097
Me?

165
00:10:26,907 --> 00:10:29,277
I certainly went to the bathroom,

166
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:34,117
but by the time I entered, the manager was already on the ground.

167
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:38,916
In other words, you're the only one who left his seat

168
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:41,997
to go to the bathroom when the crime took place.

169
00:10:42,397 --> 00:10:45,667
So, what? That doesn't mean I did it.

170
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:49,547
But aren't you the manager of a rival café?

171
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:50,826
No.

172
00:10:50,827 --> 00:10:52,466
This place sells donuts.

173
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,186
I sell waffles.

174
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,177
They're totally different genres of food.

175
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:58,346
Are they?

176
00:10:58,347 --> 00:11:00,246
I guess they are.

177
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:01,317
Excuse me.

178
00:11:01,887 --> 00:11:02,817
What is it?

179
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:05,856
Got it.

180
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:10,607
I'm sorry, but we'd like you to wait elsewhere.

181
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:12,607
We appreciate your understanding.

182
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:15,117
Based on the circumstances and testimony so far,

183
00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:18,537
Nonaka-san seems suspicious.

184
00:11:20,177 --> 00:11:23,147
But should we trust that?

185
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:31,246
Inspector Megure, we finished questioning the suspects.

186
00:11:31,247 --> 00:11:39,257
First, sales have declined at the café Nonaka-san operates recently.

187
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:45,257
At this rate, he's not sure if his café will survive beyond a few more months.

188
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:55,557
Next, Furukawa-san said he had money problems with the manager Tomita-san in the past.

189
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:04,287
Finally, the part-time employee Sakai-san didn't get along with the manager very well.

190
00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:07,147
According to part-time employee Sakai-san,

191
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:12,086
the gloves left at the crime scene belong to Nonaka-san.

192
00:12:12,087 --> 00:12:13,047
What?

193
00:12:13,517 --> 00:12:15,866
Nonaka-san is a regular here.

194
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:20,057
He clearly recognized those gloves because he always wears them.

195
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:25,336
The gloves of the only man without an alibi were at the crime scene.

196
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:26,946
Does that settle it?

197
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:31,317
As long as Nonaka-san doesn't come up with an alibi, it must be him.

198
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:33,497
I see.

199
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:35,657
So that's how it is.

200
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:42,029
Nonaka-san, allow me to be direct.

201
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:44,739
These gloves are yours, aren't they?

202
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:46,989
Are they?

203
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:52,489
Th-They're certainly mine, but I lost them a while ago.

204
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:55,008
So they're yours, then?

205
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:58,919
You don't have an alibi, you do have a motive, and then there's this material evidence.

206
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:01,988
Do you have any explanation for this?

207
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,038
Detective Chiba.

208
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,759
Huh?

209
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:05,918
What is it?

210
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,929
Listen...

211
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:10,679
Nonaka-san, could you accompany us to the station?

212
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:13,898
B-But... you have to believe me.

213
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:15,139
I really didn't do it.

214
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:17,188
You can tell us about it at the station.

215
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:18,899
Please come with us.

216
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:22,049
But I don't have anything to tell you.

217
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:27,229
Sonoko?

218
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:33,949
Are you okay?

219
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:39,079
Inspector Megure, could you wait to escort him away?

220
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:40,528
What?

221
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:43,339
Did you figure out who did it?

222
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:45,268
At first glance,

223
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:51,339
all the evidence in this case seems to indicate that Nonaka-san is the culprit.

224
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:56,948
In other words, if Nonaka-san really did do it,

225
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:59,448
don't you think it was a bit too sloppy?

226
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:00,708
That's right!

227
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:04,359
If it were me, I wouldn't have left the gloves behind.

228
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,259
And Furukawa-san.

229
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,778
Like us, you didn't go near the bathroom.

230
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:14,489
Considering that, your alibi seems perfect,

231
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:16,568
but is it really?

232
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:19,078
Isn't it a perfect alibi?

233
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,369
You could at least let me go early.

234
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:25,049
And finally, the part-timer Sakai-san.

235
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,678
You said you were in the kitchen the whole time,

236
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,879
but we didn't see you.

237
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:34,218
I was frying donuts in the kitchen the whole time.

238
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:36,468
If anything, the fact that you didn't see me

239
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:39,389
proves I was in the kitchen the whole time.

240
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:44,449
Considering their testimony, it sounds like the culprit is...

241
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:48,648
Wh-What? You still think I did it?

242
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:50,228
Well, listen.

243
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:54,678
You headed towards the men's bathroom and attacked Tomita-san,

244
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:57,229
who was already in the bathroom, with a nearby mop.

245
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:02,029
It's a very natural and plausible series of events.

246
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:05,738
Next, let's recreate Furukawa-san's actions.

247
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,379
Ran, could you show us?

248
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:09,019
Yeah.

249
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:15,259
Let's see. Furukawa-san was in his seat the whole time.

250
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:18,249
For him to attack Tomita-san in the bathroom...

251
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:24,269
It wouldn't have been possible for him to do it without us noticing.

252
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:27,769
Finally, let's recreate Sakai-san's actions.

253
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:29,779
Okay, Detective Takagi.

254
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,348
Could you follow Sonoko-neechan's instructions?

255
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,279
Got it.

256
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:36,848
There's only one route Sakai-san, who was in the kitchen,

257
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:40,688
could have taken to reach the crime scene in the bathroom

258
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,789
without passing by the tables.

259
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:44,038
He exited through the kitchen window,

260
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:47,268
crossed the yard, entered through the front entrance,

261
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:49,509
and reached the bathroom through the hallway.

262
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:53,668
He followed the same route to return to the kitchen.

263
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:55,549
That's the route you want me to recreate, right?

264
00:15:55,819 --> 00:15:57,429
Yeah. Are you ready?

265
00:15:57,969 --> 00:15:59,309
Anytime.

266
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,429
Okay... Ready, go.

267
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,619
How was that?

268
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:29,879
It's been 90 seconds so far.

269
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:45,889
Hup.

270
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:47,399
Well?

271
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:50,179
Two minutes, 50 seconds.

272
00:16:54,139 --> 00:17:00,239
That sound we heard... was the timer in the kitchen.

273
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:01,859
Excuse me.

274
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:05,159
What does all of this mean?

275
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:08,539
It means you don't have an alibi anymore.

276
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:09,489
What?

277
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:15,299
You said you were in the kitchen frying donuts when the crime took place,

278
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:19,299
but you could have gone anywhere during the three minutes

279
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,799
after you put the donuts in the fryer.

280
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:28,309
But, why were Nonaka-san's gloves in the bathroom?

281
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:33,409
If you assume Sakai-san set everything up, doesn't that explain it?

282
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:40,138
Your leading statements made me suspicious of you from the start.

283
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:41,699
Hold on.

284
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:45,869
I understand that I could've gone to the bathroom and back in three minutes.

285
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,719
But isn't there a big hole in your reasoning?

286
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,708
A hole?

287
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:54,858
That's right. Allow me to explain.

288
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:56,959
Think about it.

289
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,048
What is it?

290
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:01,089
It's this.

291
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:05,718
While you were having tea in here,

292
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:08,849
how did I cross this section of the yard?

293
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:13,099
No one could pass through here without being seen.

294
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:16,288
You're right.

295
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:18,029
That's not true.

296
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:19,029
What?

297
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:23,529
You're able to pass through this area without being seen.

298
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:26,289
What are you talking about?

299
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,188
I meant exactly what I said.

300
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:33,528
You did in fact pass through this yard and return to the kitchen

301
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,669
without being noticed by anyone.

302
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,908
You didn't even see me.

303
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,138
Show me the evidence, then!

304
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:43,888
Oh, the evidence has been standing in front of us this whole time.

305
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:44,679
What?

306
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,559
Look closely at the yard.

307
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,479
Look very closely.

308
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:58,938
Apparently you took care of that yard.

309
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:03,319
Making it the same color as your uniform must've required a lot of patience.

310
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:06,448
He blends in completely with the background.

311
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:08,668
He's perfectly camouflaged.

312
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:11,579
I borrowed the uniform in the changing room.

313
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,928
But even with the camouflage,

314
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:18,658
wouldn't someone notice if he passed through the yard?

315
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,839
It takes only a moment to cross.

316
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:24,018
It's one thing if you're staring at the yard,

317
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:26,558
but since everyone was focused on their tea and donuts,

318
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,479
it was unlikely that anyone would notice.

319
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,638
He probably even planned where

320
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:33,728
and how he could cross the yard unnoticed when he set it up.

321
00:19:33,729 --> 00:19:36,729
No. That's just speculation.

322
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,978
You need more proof?

323
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:42,489
Then what's that scratch on your thigh?

324
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:49,209
You got caught on the nail sticking out of the wall on your way back, didn't you?

325
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:51,369
Detective Takagi.

326
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:53,018
Conan-kun?

327
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:58,109
Detective Chiba said this cloth was stuck to a nail outside.

328
00:19:58,979 --> 00:19:59,999
What's this?

329
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:04,009
It's the same color cloth as Sakai-san's uniform.

330
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:06,658
If the police examine that cloth,

331
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:10,009
I'm sure they'll find that it came from your uniform.

332
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:13,448
There's even more evidence.

333
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:17,729
Apparently forensics reported that they found the laxatives you gave Nonaka-san

334
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:25,149
so he'd go to the bathroom in the water on his table.

335
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:29,159
How did you know it was me?

336
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,198
My plan was perfect.

337
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:33,558
It was the donuts.

338
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,659
The donuts?

339
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:38,758
This café's donuts are made to order.

340
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,419
You began frying new ones when no new customers had entered.

341
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,179
I considered what that might mean.

342
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:51,929
It's all his fault!

343
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:57,769
I came up with the menu, the concept, and the eye-catching yard.

344
00:20:58,219 --> 00:21:01,168
But he kept me working part-time.

345
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:02,939
He didn't give me anything.

346
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:05,279
So I...

347
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,648
Apparently the manager's all right.

348
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:17,718
I guess this case is closed.

349
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:20,019
You experienced your own share of misfortune.

350
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:21,709
I suppose.

351
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:24,238
Well, I should get going.

352
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,339
Hold on, Furukawa-san.

353
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:28,839
You haven't paid yet.

354
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:32,199
What? Which means...

355
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,479
What? Furukawa-san, you were going to dine and dash?

356
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:37,649
That's right.

357
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,968
Because Furukawa-san unconsciously touched his wallet in his back pocket

358
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:45,178
when Nonaka-san accused him,

359
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,239
Sonoko-neechan said it might be him.

360
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,369
Furukawa-san, could you tell us more about that?

361
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:54,488
That's why he was acting nervous the whole time.

362
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:56,499
Yeah, apparently.

363
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,039
Huh?

364
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:25,499
Solving that case made me hungry.

365
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:28,228
I'm hungry, too.

366
00:23:28,229 --> 00:23:29,418
What?

367
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:31,438
There's always room for sweets.

368
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:35,238
And after eating sweets, you need something salty.

369
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:37,999
You're right. There's always room for more.

370
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:42,099
What about low sugar and low—well, whatever.

371
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:45,649
What?

372
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:47,078
Stay back!

373
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:49,279
I'll blow her brains out!

374
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:50,588
No!

375
00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:54,028
I expect you to fulfill the three demands I'm about to list.

376
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:56,568
First, I want a car.

377
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:58,829
Bring me a car so I can get out of—

378
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:05,789
What?

379
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:07,539
Makoto-san!

380
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:12,679
The next episode of Conan is, "Kyogoku Makoto the Understudy, Part One!"
