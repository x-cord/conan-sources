1
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:03,269
Ms. Sadako.

2
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:06,569
Ms. Sadako, if you don't leave soon, you'll be late.

3
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:10,169
Ms. Sadako, I'm coming in.

4
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:13,569
What?

5
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:14,769
Ms. Sadako!

6
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:17,669
Oh, no...

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,969
Strangled?

8
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:22,669
Using rope.

9
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:24,669
The victim is the owner of the home,

10
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:26,869
Sadako Baba, 62 years old.

11
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:28,969
She was a medium and fortune teller.

12
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:30,169
A fortune teller?

13
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:31,669
Yes.

14
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:33,469
"Masaya Ogu (26)" -She ran a fortune telling shop

15
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:35,969
near Shibahama Station under the name Barbara Sadako.

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,769
This is Ms. Sadako's secretary, Mr. Masaya Ogu.

17
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:40,969
He was the first to discover the body.

18
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:43,569
We're waiting on the autopsy for details,

19
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:45,969
but it seems she was killed last night.

20
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:47,169
Last night?

21
00:00:47,169 --> 00:00:48,369
Is there a problem?

22
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:52,669
Then Detective Kogoro Mouri might know something.

23
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:54,369
Mr. Mouri?

24
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:56,769
He called yesterday.

25
00:00:56,769 --> 00:00:57,769
"Barbara Sadako's Fortune Telling"

26
00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:01,369
This is Barbara Sadako's fortune telling shop.

27
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:02,769
One moment, please.

28
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:06,869
Miss, it's Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

29
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,269
The famous detective?

30
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,069
"Sadako Baba (62)" -This is Barbara Sadako.

31
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:17,269
Mr. Mouri invited the victim out?

32
00:01:18,669 --> 00:01:20,169
In my eyes are maximum creation.

33
00:01:20,169 --> 00:01:21,769
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

34
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:23,769
The old man called the victim on the phone?

35
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:25,969
I'm curious what his fortune was.

36
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:27,469
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:29,269
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:31,869
His name is Detective Conan!

39
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:18,693
"The Fortune Teller and the Three Customers"

40
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:22,089
I didn't call her.

41
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:23,089
But...

42
00:03:23,089 --> 00:03:24,889
Don't "but" me.

43
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:27,989
Besides, I don't know anything about the victim.

44
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,989
And you were at home all night last night.

45
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:32,289
That's right.

46
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:35,189
Wait, this brat followed me again?

47
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:39,189
I verified your alibi.

48
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:41,489
It's possible the secretary did it

49
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,989
and he's trying to frame me.

50
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:47,489
He discovered the body.

51
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,889
Naturally, we checked his alibi.

52
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,289
He's totally innocent.

53
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,089
I see.

54
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:56,989
The culprit probably used Mr. Mouri name

55
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,489
to invite Ms. Sadako out to the scene of the murder.

56
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:01,989
Yes.

57
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:04,389
She wasn't killed here?

58
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:07,689
No. After being killed somewhere else,

59
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:10,489
she was transported to this house.

60
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:14,789
Why did the culprit bother to move the body?

61
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:17,889
To delay its discovery, of course.

62
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:20,489
Then wouldn't they take it into the mountains?

63
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:24,089
And why did they use your name?

64
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:27,089
Maybe because he's famous.

65
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:28,989
But if someone used your name,

66
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:31,889
wouldn't you be determined to find the culprit?

67
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:33,189
Of course.

68
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:37,589
So why would they get a detective involved?

69
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:41,189
I don't understand what this culprit is doing.

70
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,189
About the criminal profile...

71
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:48,089
Huh?

72
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,189
What's this?

73
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,989
"I was nearly killed again."

74
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:54,989
"Which one of those three did it?"

75
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:58,089
"Is it K? Is it E? Is it S?"

76
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,689
Does she mean those three?

77
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:04,789
After appearing on a live TV broadcast about a week ago...

78
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:12,289
You three...

79
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:15,089
I'm Kanawa. You told my fortune last month.

80
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:16,489
"Shinsuke Kanawa (37)" -I ran into these two

81
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:18,089
"Barbara Sadako's Client" -on the way here.

82
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:19,489
According to them,

83
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:22,489
they experienced tragedies because of your fortunes, too.

84
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,289
"Fukami Endo (29)" -We came running when we saw you on TV!

85
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:27,589
"Barbara Sadako's Client" -Take responsibility for your fortune telling!

86
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:30,289
"Ryoichi Sazanami (33)" -I'll never forgive you!

87
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,489
"Barbara Sadako's Client" -Take responsibility!

88
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:34,089
Now, now. Please calm down.

89
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:35,189
What's wrong?

90
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:38,389
This place is too public.

91
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:41,889
We should leave for now and come up with a plan later.

92
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:44,289
You'll pay for this, Barbara Sadako!

93
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:48,489
I don't know what fortunes she told them.

94
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:50,889
But if anyone hated her,

95
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:52,289
then it must have been Shinsuke Kanawa,

96
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:55,589
Fukami Endo, or Ryoichi Sazanami.

97
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:59,389
Kanawa, Endo, Sazanami.

98
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:01,789
One of them must be the culprit.

99
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:04,289
But to be sure, check to see

100
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:06,689
if there was anyone else who hated the victim.

101
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:08,289
Yes, sir.

102
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:11,289
Three suspicious persons.

103
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:13,889
One was a woman.

104
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:16,489
We found this next to the body.

105
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:23,789
That brooch.

106
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:25,489
It belongs to Ms. Endo.

107
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:30,089
So they accidentally dropped it when they transported the body here.

108
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,489
If that's true,

109
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:33,189
then they're unbelievably careless.

110
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:35,289
Excuse me.

111
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:39,789
Hello? What?

112
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:43,989
Something suspicious was just discovered at Shibahama Park.

113
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:45,989
"Shibahama Park"

114
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,289
That's Ms. Sadako's business card case.

115
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,789
Could this rope be the weapon?

116
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:55,389
This must be where she was killed.

117
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,789
I'm surprised you found them.

118
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:01,089
We received an anonymous tip this morning.

119
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:05,289
They saw a suspicious figure packing something large

120
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:07,389
into a car in this park last night.

121
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:09,189
When I came to investigate,

122
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:12,689
I found signs of a struggle and those objects.

123
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:16,089
So Fukami Endo strangled Ms. Sadako here,

124
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:19,989
drove her to that mansion, and left the body there.

125
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:23,989
I found this here as well.

126
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:25,989
S. Kanawa?

127
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:28,689
Could it belong to Shinsuke Kanawa?

128
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:33,289
Hello?

129
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:38,589
A car was abandoned near the mansion?

130
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:39,689
What?

131
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:42,989
It belongs to Ryoichi Sazanami?

132
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:45,689
I was curious, so I looked up the license plate number.

133
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:49,289
I learned it had already been reported stolen.

134
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:51,589
It was stolen two days ago.

135
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:54,989
But what's my car doing here?

136
00:07:56,089 --> 00:08:00,289
That's hair. Compare it to the victim's.

137
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:02,089
That's my lighter.

138
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:04,589
But I lost it a few days ago.

139
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:07,989
Me, too. I lost this brooch.

140
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:10,589
I've figured out who the killer is.

141
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:14,189
While these three are suspicious,

142
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:16,889
the culprit isn't one of them.

143
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:19,789
The three of them attacked the victim.

144
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:23,189
That's when Mr. Kanawa dropped his lighter.

145
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:26,289
Then they loaded the body into the car of the trunk

146
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:29,589
and transported it to the study in Ms. Sadako's mansion.

147
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:32,489
That's when Ms. Fukami dropped her brooch

148
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:35,389
and left without realizing she'd lost it.

149
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,989
It's all three of them.

150
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:39,789
-What? -What?

151
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,189
That does explain all their belongings.

152
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,389
Yes.

153
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:45,689
But...

154
00:08:45,689 --> 00:08:48,189
Inspector, these three are the only ones

155
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:49,989
who hated the victim.

156
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:51,689
Wait, we didn't do it!

157
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:53,289
Yeah!

158
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:01,489
The hair belonged to the victim.

159
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:05,989
Mr. Sazanami, your car was used to transport the body.

160
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:07,989
No way.

161
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:10,789
And all three of them hated Ms. Sadako.

162
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:12,089
Of course we did.

163
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:13,689
I was thinking of buying a house,

164
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:16,089
so I had her tell me my lucky direction.

165
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:21,189
Your lucky direction is north-northeast.

166
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:24,589
The moment I trusted her and bought a house,

167
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:27,489
the construction company I was working for shut down,

168
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:29,189
and my wife left me.

169
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:32,389
I asked her to tell me my romantic fortune.

170
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:35,489
The man right before your eyes

171
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:37,889
is the love of your life.

172
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:41,789
But when I trusted her and married him, he swindled me.

173
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,089
I had a business I wanted to start,

174
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:47,089
so I had her tell me when I should start.

175
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:50,789
Now. Your luck is at its peak.

176
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:53,889
But when I rushed to quit my job and open shop,

177
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:56,089
it failed, and now I'm drowning in debt.

178
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:58,989
All three of you suffered serious blows.

179
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:02,589
They could definitely be motives.

180
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:06,389
And none of you have alibis for last night, right?

181
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:09,089
I told you, someone called me.

182
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:10,589
It was a man.

183
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:13,789
We received the same call, too.

184
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:15,989
He was making sure we wouldn't have alibis.

185
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:19,089
The culprit set us up.

186
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:22,689
You expect us to believe your convenient story?

187
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:25,889
Hello?

188
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:28,389
What?

189
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:29,889
The results of the autopsy

190
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:34,989
show the victim died between 8 pm and 9 pm last night.

191
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:37,489
She was killed by 9 pm at the latest?

192
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:38,989
Then...

193
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:40,989
Kid, where are you going?

194
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:43,489
I knew it.

195
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:47,189
This document was created after 10 pm last night.

196
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,889
Which means...

197
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,789
The victim didn't write this.

198
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:55,889
The culprit wrote it when they brought the body here

199
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,789
to cast suspicion on these three.

200
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:01,989
In other words, they really were framed.

201
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:03,089
See?

202
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:05,189
If one of them killed her,

203
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:08,289
they'd never write this.

204
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:09,989
If they tried to frame them,

205
00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:15,889
the culprit must've known they hated the victim.

206
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:17,689
Did you tell anyone else?

207
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:20,189
I haven't told anyone.

208
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:21,289
Me, neither.

209
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:24,689
I wouldn't embarrass myself by telling anyone that.

210
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:26,189
Yeah.

211
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:28,589
But someone had to have told them.

212
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:32,489
It's hard to imagine them telling someone about it on purpose,

213
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:33,889
which means...

214
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:37,089
Please find the person who framed us.

215
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:38,689
Aren't you a great detective?

216
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:41,289
It would make up for accusing us.

217
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:43,189
If we examine the crime scene,

218
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:45,989
I'm sure we'll find a clue to the culprit's identity.

219
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:48,389
In order to find the culprit,

220
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:51,089
let's take a break before discussing the case further.

221
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:55,089
Could it be?

222
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,189
No one besides those three hated the victim, right?

223
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:02,389
Yeah. No matter how hard I looked, I couldn't find anyone else.

224
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,889
Then it's possible they weren't framed,

225
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:08,589
but the culprit wanted us to think that.

226
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:11,489
In other words, one of them is still the culprit.

227
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:14,889
Since there was no need to work together,

228
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:17,289
they probably acted alone.

229
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:22,189
Why did the culprit make us suspect all three of them?

230
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:26,989
And why did they get the old man involved?

231
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:30,989
No, there must be some reason

232
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:32,889
they had to do both of those things.

233
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:36,289
And if I can figure that out,

234
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,289
I'll know who did it.

235
00:12:42,724 --> 00:12:44,924
They didn't find anything?

236
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:46,724
It's odd, though.

237
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:52,024
The secretary wouldn't have told anyone they hated the victim.

238
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:54,224
It would hurt business.

239
00:12:54,224 --> 00:12:57,524
And those three wouldn't tell anyone, either.

240
00:12:57,524 --> 00:12:59,424
It would've embarrassed them.

241
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:03,824
Doesn't that mean no one else knew?

242
00:13:04,924 --> 00:13:07,324
Where and when did I lose my lighter?

243
00:13:07,324 --> 00:13:11,724
Mr. Kogoro told me to ask you.

244
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:15,024
If he knew, he would've gone to retrieve it.

245
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:17,224
Is he really a great detective?

246
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:21,324
If they can't find the real culprit,

247
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:23,224
what's going to happen to this case?

248
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:26,124
They'll probably never solve it.

249
00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:27,624
Well...

250
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:30,924
That bogus fortune teller got what was coming to her.

251
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:32,524
I got my fortune told

252
00:13:32,524 --> 00:13:34,224
because I couldn't make a decision on my own.

253
00:13:34,224 --> 00:13:36,024
I was in the same boat.

254
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,924
I'm actually a weak person.

255
00:13:37,924 --> 00:13:39,624
Me, too.

256
00:13:39,624 --> 00:13:42,424
That's why I relied on fortune telling.

257
00:13:42,424 --> 00:13:43,824
I see.

258
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,124
When you think of it that way,

259
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:48,124
it explains why all three of them were framed.

260
00:13:48,124 --> 00:13:51,924
Well, my company wasn't doing well since before I bought the house,

261
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:55,424
and my relationship with my wife had been going poorly for a while.

262
00:13:55,424 --> 00:14:00,024
And I lied a lot about the man I was dating,

263
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:03,224
so it's possible that clouded her abilities.

264
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:05,424
Then she doesn't deserve your hate.

265
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:07,024
I know that.

266
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:09,424
My situation's different.

267
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:12,024
If she hadn't told me to start right away,

268
00:14:12,024 --> 00:14:15,224
Alien Ramen would've succeeded.

269
00:14:15,224 --> 00:14:17,424
Alien Ramen?

270
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:20,224
It's the restaurant I started after quitting my job.

271
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:24,024
Waiters dressed like aliens bring your ramen to you

272
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:25,524
and throw pieces of star-shaped pork

273
00:14:25,524 --> 00:14:28,624
into it while shouting, "Shooting star!"

274
00:14:29,624 --> 00:14:32,024
As long as I opened at the right time,

275
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:34,824
business would've been booming.

276
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:35,924
Right?

277
00:14:36,924 --> 00:14:39,724
Why is he so confident?

278
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:40,824
Right?

279
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:43,424
Don't ask me.

280
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,924
I need to use the bathroom.

281
00:14:46,524 --> 00:14:48,224
What?

282
00:14:48,224 --> 00:14:49,824
So that's how it is.

283
00:14:49,824 --> 00:14:51,324
When you think of it that way,

284
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:54,224
it explains why they got the old man involved.

285
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:56,624
But there's not enough evidence.

286
00:14:56,624 --> 00:14:57,724
In that case...

287
00:14:58,424 --> 00:15:00,224
I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri,

288
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:02,324
and I'm assisting with the investigation.

289
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:05,124
There's something I'd like to confirm with you.

290
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:12,924
I know.

291
00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:17,524
Yes, could you please compare it to the data I just sent you?

292
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:18,924
Thank you.

293
00:15:20,024 --> 00:15:22,724
Everyone, Mr. Mouri just called to say

294
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:25,624
he's figured out the case.

295
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,224
What?

296
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:28,224
"Shibahama Park"

297
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:31,524
Mr. Kanawa, Ms. Endo, Mr. Sazanami.

298
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:34,224
You weren't framed by the culprit.

299
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:37,224
You wanted us to think you were.

300
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:38,624
What?

301
00:15:38,624 --> 00:15:41,124
What does that mean, Mr. Mouri?

302
00:15:41,124 --> 00:15:46,424
By pretending they were framed by the true culprit

303
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:48,924
after killing the victim,

304
00:15:48,924 --> 00:15:52,324
they tried to avoid becoming suspects.

305
00:15:52,324 --> 00:15:57,424
In other words, there was never a true culprit who framed them?

306
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:00,124
Yes. I was right all along.

307
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:03,024
All three of them are accomplices.

308
00:16:03,024 --> 00:16:04,224
-What? -What?

309
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:06,624
It does make sense.

310
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:10,124
These three are the only ones who hated the victim.

311
00:16:10,124 --> 00:16:13,824
Sounds like we'll have to question you again.

312
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:15,924
Bring them down to the station.

313
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:16,924
Yes, sir.

314
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:18,324
Wait a minute!

315
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:19,824
I didn't do it!

316
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:22,024
Find the true culprit!

317
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:26,024
That should mean this case... is closed...

318
00:16:27,224 --> 00:16:29,324
Wait, everyone.

319
00:16:29,324 --> 00:16:33,224
All three of you being accomplices is just one possibility.

320
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:35,824
There's also another way to interpret the situation.

321
00:16:35,824 --> 00:16:37,424
Another interpretation?

322
00:16:37,424 --> 00:16:42,424
The key to solving this case is in the culprit's character.

323
00:16:42,424 --> 00:16:43,924
Character?

324
00:16:43,924 --> 00:16:46,124
What does that mean?

325
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:48,924
The culprit moved the body,

326
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,924
even though it didn't benefit them in any way.

327
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:54,824
They deliberately left personal items

328
00:16:54,824 --> 00:16:58,524
at the murder scene and body's location

329
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:03,224
because they needed Mr. Sazanami's car to move the body...

330
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,424
so that along with the text document,

331
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:09,124
all three of them would be suspects.

332
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:13,624
To make it look like they'd been framed?

333
00:17:13,624 --> 00:17:15,524
There was that, of course,

334
00:17:15,524 --> 00:17:19,124
but the culprit's character required them to do it.

335
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:20,424
What?

336
00:17:20,424 --> 00:17:22,024
If you look at their motive,

337
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:24,624
it was clear they'd eventually fall under suspicion.

338
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:29,124
Rather than fearing when the police would arrive at their door,

339
00:17:29,124 --> 00:17:32,824
they thought it'd be better to be identified right away.

340
00:17:32,824 --> 00:17:35,324
What kind of stupid logic is that?

341
00:17:35,324 --> 00:17:38,624
They're not stupid, they're weak.

342
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,424
So weak they relied on a fortune teller

343
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:42,324
to make life decisions.

344
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:46,724
So all three of them did it.

345
00:17:46,724 --> 00:17:48,524
Because the culprit was weak,

346
00:17:48,524 --> 00:17:50,924
they felt uneasy doing it alone.

347
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:52,924
They wanted others beside them

348
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:54,924
who were in the same situation,

349
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:58,124
same motive, no alibi,

350
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:00,724
and personal items left at the crime scene.

351
00:18:00,724 --> 00:18:03,324
Who is the culprit?

352
00:18:03,324 --> 00:18:04,724
They also used my name

353
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:06,824
and got me involved because of their weakness.

354
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:10,324
If the investigation dragged on,

355
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:13,624
the police would be forced to ask for my help.

356
00:18:13,624 --> 00:18:16,324
Rather than anxiously waiting to see

357
00:18:16,324 --> 00:18:18,024
when the great detective would turn up...

358
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:20,724
It'd be better for you to be involved from the start?

359
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,824
Exactly.

360
00:18:22,824 --> 00:18:25,624
And if I, a man trusted by the police,

361
00:18:25,624 --> 00:18:27,524
deduced that the three of them

362
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,924
were framed by the true culprit,

363
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:32,524
there would be no greater assurance.

364
00:18:32,524 --> 00:18:34,024
But, Mr. Mouri...

365
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:37,924
There's no guarantee that you'd come to the desired conclusion.

366
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:40,124
That's exactly the key point.

367
00:18:40,124 --> 00:18:41,124
-What? -What?

368
00:18:41,124 --> 00:18:44,124
A normal person wouldn't take that risk.

369
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,924
But the culprit believed it would work.

370
00:18:47,924 --> 00:18:52,424
One of these three is simultaneously weak-willed

371
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:55,724
but also incredibly confident.

372
00:18:55,724 --> 00:18:57,024
Right,

373
00:18:57,024 --> 00:18:58,724
Mr. Ryoichi Sazanami?

374
00:18:58,724 --> 00:18:59,824
What?

375
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:01,324
It's him?

376
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:03,324
No, no. It couldn't be me.

377
00:19:03,324 --> 00:19:06,924
Yesterday you called the victim,

378
00:19:06,924 --> 00:19:08,124
inviting them out.

379
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:11,824
I am the Detective Kogori Mouri.

380
00:19:11,824 --> 00:19:15,124
I have something to discuss with Ms. Barbara Sadako.

381
00:19:15,124 --> 00:19:17,724
Then you called Mr. Kanawa and Ms. Endo

382
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:20,524
so they wouldn't have alibis.

383
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:23,724
Ms. Sadako will be visiting you tonight

384
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:25,024
to apologize for her fortune telling.

385
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:26,824
Please wait at your home.

386
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:30,724
Then you killed the victim in Shibahama Park.

387
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:33,724
You left Mr. Kanawa's lighter at the scene of the murder,

388
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:37,024
which you likely stole when you went to make a complaint.

389
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:40,424
You used your allegedly stolen car

390
00:19:40,424 --> 00:19:42,724
to transport the body to the Baba mansion

391
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:47,324
and left Ms. Endo's brooch, which you also stole, by the body.

392
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:51,924
You also left the text document that would be discovered

393
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,624
during the course of the investigation then.

394
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:56,624
The culprit set us up.

395
00:19:57,624 --> 00:19:59,024
After making that claim,

396
00:19:59,024 --> 00:20:02,724
you waited for the time of death to be determined.

397
00:20:02,724 --> 00:20:07,324
If one of them killed her, they'd never write this.

398
00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:12,224
You escaped into that blind spot and tried to get away

399
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:16,324
while the police searched for a true culprit who didn't exist.

400
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:21,824
Yes, so the case would never be solved.

401
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:23,924
Weak-willed but confident?

402
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:27,424
Now I'm the killer just because of my character?

403
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:29,224
I have nothing to do with the case!

404
00:20:29,224 --> 00:20:33,724
Then how did you know the murder was committed here?

405
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:35,124
There's no way for me to...

406
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:37,324
You told us.

407
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:41,424
You mean the anonymous call?

408
00:20:41,424 --> 00:20:45,324
I listened to the recording earlier.

409
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:49,024
I saw a suspicious figure in Shibahama Park last night.

410
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:52,124
I didn't make that call!

411
00:20:54,624 --> 00:20:55,724
I'll answer it.

412
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,024
Yeah, I'll let him know.

413
00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:02,624
They said it's a match.

414
00:21:04,724 --> 00:21:07,424
I had them compare your voices...

415
00:21:08,424 --> 00:21:11,324
after sending your voice to forensics.

416
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:14,324
You made the call.

417
00:21:14,324 --> 00:21:16,424
You told us the scene of the murder,

418
00:21:16,424 --> 00:21:19,124
which only the culprit could've known.

419
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:22,924
I dug my own grave with that phone call?

420
00:21:22,924 --> 00:21:25,724
But why did he make that call?

421
00:21:25,724 --> 00:21:27,724
He had to.

422
00:21:27,724 --> 00:21:30,724
Only once we discovered Mr. Kanawa's lighter

423
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:32,724
left at the scene of the murder

424
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:37,124
would all three of them be together.

425
00:21:38,124 --> 00:21:41,224
I felt hopeless without everyone here.

426
00:21:41,224 --> 00:21:44,624
So you admit you killed Ms. Barbara Sadako?

427
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:46,824
If she'd properly told me my fortune,

428
00:21:46,824 --> 00:21:49,224
it would've succeeded!

429
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,624
There's no way Alien Ramen wouldn't draw customers!

430
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:54,524
Alien Ramen?

431
00:21:55,724 --> 00:21:59,124
Weak-willed but confident.

432
00:21:59,124 --> 00:22:01,024
What a character.

433
00:23:24,524 --> 00:23:29,224
Easily flattered, drunkard, and irresponsible...

434
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:31,624
Huh? Who are you talking about?

435
00:23:31,624 --> 00:23:36,624
Does anyone that hopeless exist?

436
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:39,024
Nope, nope.

437
00:23:39,024 --> 00:23:40,424
No self-awareness?

438
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:43,724
"Next Episode" -Let's have an explosive time,

439
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:45,924
just like we planned.

440
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,424
If only Conan were here...

441
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:50,624
Nicely done, Ayumi.

442
00:23:50,624 --> 00:23:52,524
You realized something important.

443
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:56,824
What's the most important part of a police investigation?

444
00:23:58,724 --> 00:24:00,624
If you catch the bad guys,

445
00:24:00,624 --> 00:24:05,324
you might be rewared with lots of tasty food.

446
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:06,324
What?

447
00:24:06,924 --> 00:24:08,624
Next Conan,

448
00:24:08,624 --> 00:24:12,224
"Intrigue at the Food Court"
