1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,218
Ai looked good.

2
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:05,718
She said that her fever already came down, too.

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:08,618
I guess she can come to school on Monday.

4
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:11,118
That's why we didn't have to go out of our way to visit her.

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,918
As would be expected of the detective squad.

6
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:16,119
Thank you really so much.

7
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,018
Not at all, no problem.

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,118
No need to thank us.

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,418
For the silver detectives,

10
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:26,118
looking for stolen items is duck soup!

11
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:27,918
-Right, guys? -Yeah.

12
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:29,319
-Yes. -Yep.

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,618
They found the stolen bike, these elders.

14
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,118
I guess so.

15
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:40,718
But, silver detectives...

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,019
We formed a group to protect the peace and safety of the people.

17
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:54,019
The silver detective squad!

18
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,919
In other words, a group of elderly detectives.

19
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:05,018
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

20
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,218
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

21
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:08,918
An unexpected rival finally appears

22
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:11,018
and throws a scare at the boys detective squad

23
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:12,518
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:14,418
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:16,719
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:55,513 --> 00:03:01,213
"The Boy Detectives VS. the Silver Detectives"

27
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:03,612
I see.

28
00:03:03,613 --> 00:03:07,112
So, you're the famous boys detective squad.

29
00:03:07,113 --> 00:03:09,212
Famous...

30
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:12,612
I am Mutsuhiko Akasaka.

31
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:14,412
Mutsuhiko?

32
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:16,812
You're Mitsuhiko, right?

33
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:18,712
Our names sound the same

34
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:19,812
but the fact that we tend to stay conventional

35
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:22,812
and refuse to take risks are quite similar, too.

36
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:24,813
Refuse to take risks?

37
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:29,112
I'm Ginta Oshima.

38
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:30,412
Ginta?

39
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:32,412
Yeah. Just like you,

40
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:35,513
I'm nothing but a high-spirited big eater.

41
00:03:36,713 --> 00:03:39,412
Who's nothing but a big eater?

42
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:41,612
I'm Yasuko Emoto.

43
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:44,612
I'm just like you, Ayumi.

44
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:47,413
All I do is scream, and am the only woman of the group.

45
00:03:49,113 --> 00:03:51,712
I do more than scream.

46
00:03:51,713 --> 00:03:54,412
I'm Eitaro Tokunaga.

47
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:59,612
Which means, I'm you? Conan?

48
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:02,112
You don't have to go out of your way to overlay yourselves with us.

49
00:04:02,113 --> 00:04:05,012
So, the members of the silver detective squad!

50
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:07,712
Let's head out to our safety patrol!

51
00:04:07,713 --> 00:04:09,313
Yeah...

52
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:15,913
Kiddy detective squad vs. Silver detective squad.

53
00:04:18,913 --> 00:04:23,012
"The following day"

54
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,912
-What is it? -It looks to be a case.

55
00:04:25,913 --> 00:04:27,713
Let's contact Conan.

56
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:34,812
I appreciate you letting us know about the incident.

57
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:36,912
But, you people...

58
00:04:36,913 --> 00:04:38,212
What the?

59
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:41,413
Are these old men the ones who first found the body?

60
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:44,813
You...

61
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:48,112
It looks like things are going to get complicated again.

62
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:51,612
But how'd you find a body

63
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:53,812
that was in somebody else's house?

64
00:04:53,813 --> 00:04:56,712
Well, just ahead from here,

65
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,712
I saw a punk like man throwing a cigarette on the ground.

66
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:01,013
Your cigarette...

67
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:05,712
I cautioned him, and he fled after knocking me down.

68
00:05:05,713 --> 00:05:09,012
So, I called the members of the detective squad.

69
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:12,113
We looked for that punk together.

70
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,312
Over there!

71
00:05:15,313 --> 00:05:16,713
There he is!

72
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:21,712
It seems he ran into that house.

73
00:05:21,713 --> 00:05:23,912
-Okay. -That house, right?

74
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:25,412
That house.

75
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:26,612
Yeah.

76
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:29,713
And we split trying to look for him.

77
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:32,813
What is it?

78
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:39,712
This is a murder, no?

79
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:41,612
Call the police...

80
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:43,712
If he's still breathing, it's the ambulance.

81
00:05:43,713 --> 00:05:46,012
We've got to confirm.

82
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,313
All right.

83
00:05:51,713 --> 00:05:54,512
-How about it? -Is he alive?

84
00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:56,212
No.

85
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:57,913
He's dead.

86
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:00,712
I see.

87
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:02,912
The victim is the only son of this house,

88
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:05,912
Mr. Kiyomasa Kuroda, age 22.

89
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:08,312
He was struck on the head with a statue.

90
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:09,712
The time of death was

91
00:06:09,713 --> 00:06:12,612
about an hour before the four found him.

92
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:15,712
And? What were you and the others

93
00:06:15,713 --> 00:06:18,612
scolded about from Inspector Megure?

94
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:21,813
It was the first time I ever saw a murder site, so...

95
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:24,913
I'm scared!

96
00:06:30,113 --> 00:06:32,313
He was probably struck with this!

97
00:06:33,513 --> 00:06:36,412
Probably with this corner.

98
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:38,612
You went and messed up the site

99
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:42,112
that was supposed to be preserved, the four of you.

100
00:06:42,113 --> 00:06:43,712
-I'm sorry. -Very sorry.

101
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:45,812
-Sorry. -I'm very sorry.

102
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:50,612
Hey, and what happened to the punk that you were looking for?

103
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:51,613
What?

104
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:54,112
That's right, I completely forgot.

105
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,712
-Yeah. -Yeah.

106
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:57,512
I guess he got away

107
00:06:57,513 --> 00:07:01,113
while we were being distracted by the murder.

108
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,612
But I wonder why he ran just because he was cautioned

109
00:07:04,613 --> 00:07:07,912
not to throw his cigarette on the ground?

110
00:07:07,913 --> 00:07:10,512
Maybe he'd done something else, too.

111
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,112
He looked really looked like trouble.

112
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:15,512
He was wearing flashy sunglasses and an aloha shirt

113
00:07:15,513 --> 00:07:17,112
and his hair was dyed blonde.

114
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:20,112
He had a scar, over here too.

115
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:21,612
A scar?

116
00:07:21,613 --> 00:07:24,212
You see, like he was slashed with a knife or something.

117
00:07:24,213 --> 00:07:29,012
Now that you mentioned it. Yeah, he did.

118
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:31,412
He was a tall man, wasn't he?

119
00:07:31,413 --> 00:07:34,212
It's true, he was tall.

120
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:37,913
Yes, he was a tall young man.

121
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:44,512
About the victim Mr. Kiyomasa Kuroda,

122
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:46,612
his reputation is the pits.

123
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:49,212
He seemed to be a good-for-nothing that never had a decent job.

124
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:50,412
Maybe he was sponging somebody for the money

125
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:52,412
he used for his own pleasure.

126
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:54,112
The crime could've been committed by the one

127
00:07:54,113 --> 00:07:57,312
was made to supply the cash.

128
00:07:57,313 --> 00:08:00,012
Let's crack the suspect on that line.

129
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,212
Let's go!

130
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:02,413
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

131
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:09,613
This car of his was probably bought with the money.

132
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:14,312
Rather, that's not for me to say, I guess.

133
00:08:14,313 --> 00:08:17,812
-We've got to recover our honor. -Yes.

134
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:22,812
The perp is probably going to get rid of all inconvenient belongings.

135
00:08:22,813 --> 00:08:26,512
If we can find it, it'll probably lead us to the perp!

136
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:27,913
Let's go!

137
00:08:31,313 --> 00:08:33,512
You wouldn't be able to find something like that

138
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,312
only at your own convenience, right?

139
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:37,412
Let's go ask around to see

140
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:38,912
if there was anybody suspicious, too.

141
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:40,513
-Let's. -Yeah!

142
00:08:41,913 --> 00:08:43,913
They're in complete rival mode.

143
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:48,312
If getting rid of anything,

144
00:08:48,313 --> 00:08:51,513
it would be fastest to throw it in a river or something.

145
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:02,812
This is what that punk was wearing.

146
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:04,313
What?

147
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,413
This stain...

148
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:10,613
This must be...

149
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:18,613
Seems they got nothing.

150
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:29,112
Hey, did you find it?

151
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:31,112
Huh? Oh, yeah.

152
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:33,112
The silver detectives

153
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:36,612
found sunglasses that had blood stains on it.

154
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:38,312
We checked and found out that the blood stain

155
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:41,012
was that of the victim Mr. Kiyomasa Kuroda!

156
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,512
What?

157
00:09:42,513 --> 00:09:45,612
In other words, the one who committed this crime

158
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:49,212
was the punk that we were pursuing.

159
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,313
Yes...

160
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:56,512
He snuck into that house, killed the victim and fled.

161
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,112
But he realized that

162
00:09:58,113 --> 00:10:01,712
he left something behind at the scene of the crime,

163
00:10:01,713 --> 00:10:04,612
He rushed and came back, got rid of the evidence

164
00:10:04,613 --> 00:10:06,813
and fled once again.

165
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:12,312
The perp who realized that

166
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:15,812
the blood of the victim was left behind on the sunglasses

167
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:19,412
threw it into this dry riverbed to get rid of the evidence.

168
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:21,912
At least what he's saying is logical.

169
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,212
True.

170
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:27,312
And? What are the characteristics of that punk?

171
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:29,612
He was blonde and wearing an aloha shirt.

172
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:32,212
He had a scar like this over here.

173
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:34,312
He was really tall.

174
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:37,112
And a young man.

175
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:39,013
Okay! Let's get to it right away!

176
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:45,612
They've made a great discovery even after finding the stolen bike!

177
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:48,612
Yes, they beat us to it.

178
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:51,312
How depressing.

179
00:10:51,313 --> 00:10:53,312
What's the matter, Conan?

180
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:56,412
Don't you think that the story's too well made?

181
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:57,413
What?

182
00:10:57,414 --> 00:11:00,112
Well, if you look at it in that light,

183
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:01,712
maybe the story does sound a bit too well made, but...

184
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:06,012
Those old people were really lucky, weren't they?

185
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:08,712
Besides, I wonder why they decided

186
00:11:08,713 --> 00:11:11,313
to form a detective squad to begin with anyway?

187
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:17,713
Something bothers me.

188
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:27,047
What? Are you talking about yesterday's bike thief?

189
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:30,347
Yep. How was he found?

190
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:38,747
Well, Mr. Tokunaga heard that a red bike had been stolen.

191
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:41,447
And we all went out to look for it!

192
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:44,147
Mr. Tokunaga deduced that a thief would probably

193
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:46,747
disposed of the bike that he stole in a certain specified place.

194
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,247
And he was right!

195
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:51,648
I see. So Mr. Tokunaga made the deduction.

196
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:58,747
Nope. I only told the police about my bike being stolen.

197
00:11:58,748 --> 00:12:01,747
And yet they knew it was stolen.

198
00:12:01,748 --> 00:12:04,147
I tell you, detectives are really something.

199
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:05,748
Thank you.

200
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:10,947
Let's split up and check.

201
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:12,348
-Okay! -Okay!

202
00:12:18,348 --> 00:12:20,747
We're all gathered.

203
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:22,647
Then, let me start.

204
00:12:22,648 --> 00:12:27,247
The silver detective squad was formed about a month ago.

205
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:30,747
Mr. Tokunaga called out for members on the city newsletter.

206
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:31,847
This is the one, right?

207
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:33,047
"Looking for members!"

208
00:12:33,048 --> 00:12:34,847
So, it was him after all.

209
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:39,448
And as to why he decided to form a detective squad...

210
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:42,547
I know why!

211
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:43,747
What?

212
00:12:43,748 --> 00:12:45,047
Just about that time,

213
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:49,247
the person who was living in the apartment next door passed away.

214
00:12:49,248 --> 00:12:52,047
A granny living alone called Tae Kano

215
00:12:52,048 --> 00:12:55,047
fell from the station stairs and hit her head.

216
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:56,847
It seems she was on her way back home from the bank

217
00:12:56,848 --> 00:13:00,047
after she had withdrawn 3 million yen,

218
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:03,547
so she was probably pushed down by somebody who was after her money.

219
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:06,247
That's why in order to look for that perp,

220
00:13:06,248 --> 00:13:09,347
Mr. Tokunaga formed a detective squad.

221
00:13:09,348 --> 00:13:12,747
Too bad, but that's not possible.

222
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,247
Why not?

223
00:13:14,248 --> 00:13:18,947
That granny called Mrs. Kano died of an accident.

224
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:21,147
She accidentally fell off the stairs

225
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:24,147
because she had one broken leg.

226
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:28,247
What? She wasn't pushed off?

227
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:31,947
I see. It seems she broke her leg

228
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:34,547
because she was hit slightly by a car a few days ago.

229
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:39,347
Maybe Mr. Tokunaga formed the silver detective squad

230
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:42,947
to go and look for the reckless car driver.

231
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:45,547
Nope. I think that's not right either.

232
00:13:45,548 --> 00:13:46,947
What?

233
00:13:46,948 --> 00:13:51,047
Because the identity of the driver of that car is known.

234
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:53,647
It seems to be that person called Kiyomasa Kuroda

235
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:55,947
who was struck on the head and murdered!

236
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:58,047
-Huh? -What?

237
00:13:58,048 --> 00:14:01,547
But it seems he really treated her with all his heart,

238
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:04,947
so it seems she didn't even report the incident to the police.

239
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:08,647
A few days later, that person passes away.

240
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:11,648
After withdrawing a large sun of 3 million yen?

241
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:16,747
Don't tell me that the money was...

242
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:17,947
Maybe he was sponging somebody for the money

243
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:19,648
he used for his own pleasure.

244
00:14:20,348 --> 00:14:21,547
A very good attitude,

245
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:24,248
the exact opposite of the reputation his neighborhood had of him.

246
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,347
This plot was thought out to work this way to begin with.

247
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:30,748
I see.

248
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,547
Conan?

249
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:36,347
Did you figure something out?

250
00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:37,847
Tell us!

251
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:41,647
As to the punk, all except Mr. Tokunaga,

252
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:45,047
the way the three replied didn't sound too reliable.

253
00:14:45,048 --> 00:14:46,247
Yes.

254
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:48,947
That's wasn't because of their age,

255
00:14:48,948 --> 00:14:52,647
but it was the "Emperor's Snuff-Box".

256
00:14:52,648 --> 00:14:54,347
What's that?

257
00:14:54,348 --> 00:14:56,847
A thing to put a key and cigarette inside?

258
00:14:56,848 --> 00:15:00,047
The "Emperor's Snuff-Box" is

259
00:15:00,048 --> 00:15:03,847
a mystery novel that was written by John Dickson Carr,

260
00:15:03,848 --> 00:15:05,547
the so-called master of "locked room mysteries",

261
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:07,448
a detective novels writer.

262
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:15,547
We can't find that punk.

263
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,147
I wonder where he went?

264
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:19,148
I think it's a waste of time.

265
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:24,747
No matter how much you look for him, you'll never find him.

266
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:26,547
What?

267
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:28,947
What do you say that, Conan?

268
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:33,547
Was that punk really blonde and wearing an aloha shirt?

269
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:35,647
Right.

270
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:38,847
Did he really have a scar here?

271
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:40,747
Was he tall?

272
00:15:40,748 --> 00:15:43,147
Was he a young man?

273
00:15:43,148 --> 00:15:45,347
Yes, correct...

274
00:15:45,348 --> 00:15:48,448
Then, tell us what kind of aloha shirt it was.

275
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,347
There were palm trees on it.

276
00:15:52,348 --> 00:15:53,947
-It was yellow. -It was bright red.

277
00:15:53,948 --> 00:15:55,147
What?

278
00:15:55,148 --> 00:15:58,347
You're all saying different things.

279
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:00,547
That's because...

280
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:03,747
There's a famous mystery novel.

281
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:06,247
Although you actually didn't see it,

282
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:09,247
if somebody keeps telling you, you did,

283
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:12,048
you feel like you actually saw it.

284
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,447
You couldn't have seen him.

285
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:20,047
Because he doesn't exist to begin with.

286
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:22,748
Isn't that right, Mr. Tokunaga?

287
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:27,447
Just what do you mean?

288
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:31,347
Mr. Tokunaga, you got to know the guy called Mr. Kiyomasa Kuroda

289
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:32,747
who was killed, didn't you?

290
00:16:32,748 --> 00:16:36,748
After Mrs. Tae Kano was hit by him.

291
00:16:37,848 --> 00:16:40,447
Who's that? Mrs. Tae Kano?

292
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:42,847
Rather, Mr. Tokunaga...

293
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:45,648
Did you know him? That victim?

294
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:53,448
Mr. Tokunaga probably couldn't forgive Mr. Kuroda.

295
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:59,148
Mr. Kuroda deliberately bumped into Mrs. Tae Kano with his car.

296
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:02,747
Then after faking to be of good character,

297
00:17:02,748 --> 00:17:04,947
he grasps Mrs. Kano's heart.

298
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:06,947
He deceives her using all of his sweet talking tactics available

299
00:17:06,948 --> 00:17:08,948
to sponge money out of her.

300
00:17:15,048 --> 00:17:19,147
Mrs. Kano went to withdraw the money and died,

301
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:23,148
so as a result, it's as if she died because of Mr. Kuroda's evil doings.

302
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:27,947
That's why Mr. Tokunaga decided to take revenge on Mr. Kuroda.

303
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:29,347
To kill him.

304
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,247
What?

305
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:33,347
You're just making things up.

306
00:17:33,348 --> 00:17:35,347
I wouldn't do such...

307
00:17:35,348 --> 00:17:38,147
You didn't want anyone to witness you,

308
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:42,147
so you decided to kill him in this house.

309
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:43,647
I'd be arrested

310
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:47,447
because stuff like hair would inevitably be left behind.

311
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:51,447
That's why you decided to be the first to discover the corpse, no?

312
00:17:51,448 --> 00:17:53,947
In order to make everyone believe that

313
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,847
no matter what you dropped at the site,

314
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:57,848
you dropped it when you found the corpse.

315
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:03,347
But the police would most naturally suspect the first discoverer,

316
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,047
so being alone wouldn't do you good.

317
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:08,447
In order to discover the body, you'd have to go into the premises,

318
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:11,147
so you'd need a reason to do so, too.

319
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:14,848
So, you came up with the idea of forming a detective squad.

320
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:20,247
You waited for an opportunity and today,

321
00:18:20,248 --> 00:18:22,047
when Mr. Kuroda was alone in his house

322
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:24,347
since his family went on a trip,

323
00:18:24,348 --> 00:18:27,447
you thought of an excuse to visit this house.

324
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:31,147
And when he was off his guard, you killed him.

325
00:18:31,148 --> 00:18:33,247
You left the crime scene once

326
00:18:33,248 --> 00:18:34,747
and disposed of Mr. Kuroda's sunglasses

327
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:37,547
with blood stains on it into the dry riverbed

328
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:40,947
and called the members of the detective squad and instigated them.

329
00:18:40,948 --> 00:18:44,347
It seems he ran into that house.

330
00:18:44,348 --> 00:18:46,547
-Okay. -That house, right?

331
00:18:46,548 --> 00:18:47,647
That house.

332
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:49,047
Yeah.

333
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:51,247
Using a non-existing search for a punk,

334
00:18:51,248 --> 00:18:53,247
you got into the grounds of the Kuroda residence,

335
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:56,147
and became the first discovers of the body together.

336
00:18:56,148 --> 00:18:58,547
You pretended to play detective,

337
00:18:58,548 --> 00:19:00,847
and moreover, tried to erase the fingerprints of the perp

338
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,247
that was never there to begin,

339
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:07,147
by saying you did so by mistake.

340
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:08,247
In other words,

341
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,547
the silver detective squad was something you formed

342
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:12,747
in order to find the corpse together with the members of the group

343
00:19:12,748 --> 00:19:17,247
and to keep yourself from being suspected.

344
00:19:17,248 --> 00:19:19,947
That is, you formed it only as a front to hide your crime, no?

345
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:22,247
Mr. Tokunaga, you...

346
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:23,647
Can't be...

347
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:25,947
Is what this boy is saying...

348
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:28,547
Conan.

349
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:31,447
In order to frame a non-existent punk up as the perp,

350
00:19:31,448 --> 00:19:34,147
you needed to find the sunglasses.

351
00:19:34,148 --> 00:19:36,747
But finding something so needed all of a sudden like that

352
00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:38,447
would be too convenient,

353
00:19:38,448 --> 00:19:40,647
so you performed an achievement beforehand.

354
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:43,447
That is, you stole a bike, then pretended to find it.

355
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,947
You acted out a one-man show.

356
00:19:45,948 --> 00:19:50,247
To begin with, I've never seen that victim before today.

357
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:54,548
But, you knew, which car was Mr. Kuroda's.

358
00:19:56,848 --> 00:20:00,848
This car of his was probably bought with the money.

359
00:20:01,948 --> 00:20:03,347
It's because you were waiting for an opportunity

360
00:20:03,348 --> 00:20:05,248
to go after him, right?

361
00:20:07,448 --> 00:20:09,747
The police would eventually realize

362
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:13,247
that the person who first discovered the body and the victim

363
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:15,347
had a common point of contact.

364
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,747
Once they realize that,

365
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,947
they won't take things as being coincidental.

366
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:21,747
If they narrow the investigation down to you, Mr. Tokunaga,

367
00:20:21,748 --> 00:20:24,147
an absolute concrete evidence would surely come up.

368
00:20:24,148 --> 00:20:26,547
If that happens, it's too late.

369
00:20:26,548 --> 00:20:28,747
But, if now, you may still make it in time.

370
00:20:28,748 --> 00:20:31,747
If you go to the police before they suspect you,

371
00:20:31,748 --> 00:20:33,747
you'd be turning yourself in, right?

372
00:20:33,748 --> 00:20:36,248
That will make your sentence lighter, wouldn't it?

373
00:20:37,848 --> 00:20:39,947
You're...

374
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:43,648
We just want you to compensate for what you've done.

375
00:20:45,048 --> 00:20:47,148
Mr. Tokunaga.

376
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,947
When Mrs. Kano passed away,

377
00:20:50,948 --> 00:20:53,648
I came here to visit Kuroda.

378
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:58,347
If only she didn't hurt her leg...

379
00:20:58,348 --> 00:21:02,847
All I want is for you to come offer her incense.

380
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:04,547
Talk of a useless old hag.

381
00:21:04,548 --> 00:21:08,547
I wish she would've croaked after giving me the money.

382
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:10,847
That 3 million yen...

383
00:21:10,848 --> 00:21:14,848
All I need to do is hook another prey with my car again.

384
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:21,047
I found out then, that everything was schemed to begin with.

385
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:23,948
I couldn't help, feeling sympathetic towards Mrs. Kano.

386
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:29,647
I'm sorry. That's why I used you people.

387
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:32,747
That's okay already. More importantly...

388
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:34,847
Let's go to the police.

389
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,047
We'll go with you.

390
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:39,448
Before it's too late.

391
00:21:41,848 --> 00:21:44,247
You guys...

392
00:21:44,248 --> 00:21:46,248
Thank you.

393
00:23:13,748 --> 00:23:16,147
Hey! What's up?

394
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:19,247
They're saying they want to join the boys detective squad.

395
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:20,248
What?

396
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:22,447
Please let me join you!

397
00:23:22,448 --> 00:23:24,647
I'll treat you to eels over rice!

398
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:27,448
I'll try not to scream!

399
00:23:29,648 --> 00:23:32,648
Hey, wait! Please!

400
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:37,747
Boy, if they can run that fast,

401
00:23:37,748 --> 00:23:39,948
I don't think they need a silver pass.

402
00:23:42,448 --> 00:23:43,747
"Next Episode" -Darn it!

403
00:23:43,748 --> 00:23:45,947
I can't figure it out at all!

404
00:23:45,948 --> 00:23:49,747
Those people... I wonder what they're looking at?

405
00:23:49,748 --> 00:23:52,447
It's probably the spring mirage.

406
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:55,148
Uozu is known for mirages, you see.

407
00:23:56,348 --> 00:23:57,948
That's it!

408
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:12,248
Next Conan, "An Angel Vanishes in the Mirage"
