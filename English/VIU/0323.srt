1
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:04,838
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,938
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:08,938
Is Tokyo a weak point for the detective of the West?

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:11,038
His life is at stake and are forced to send out an SOS!

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:12,738
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:14,638
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,839
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:05,003
Is it here, Kazuha?

9
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:06,703
No. It's not there, Heiji.

10
00:02:06,704 --> 00:02:08,403
More to the left.

11
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:10,303
Left?

12
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,803
Is it around here?

13
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:12,903
It hurts!

14
00:02:12,904 --> 00:02:14,403
Where do you stick it at, Heiji?

15
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:16,303
I told you it's to the left.

16
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,803
You fool! Keep your voice down.

17
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:20,904
They will hear us.

18
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:30,403
Darn it.

19
00:02:30,404 --> 00:02:32,803
The safety pin went into the slit in the floor.

20
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:34,103
You're so clumsy!

21
00:02:34,104 --> 00:02:37,103
You can't get rid of this cuff without it.

22
00:02:37,104 --> 00:02:40,103
Don't you have anything else? Like a wire?

23
00:02:40,104 --> 00:02:41,803
No, that's the only thing I got.

24
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:44,503
Darn it.

25
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:48,803
Well, maybe it's better if we try solve this cipher.

26
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:51,603
They said if we solve it, they'd release us.

27
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,604
That's right!

28
00:02:56,504 --> 00:03:01,103
If you want to go out and see the sun,

29
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:05,304
solve it quickly or...

30
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:09,103
Mr. Kusukawa?

31
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:12,904
You will be as cold as he is.

32
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:18,003
Heiji.

33
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:19,603
Don't worry.

34
00:03:19,604 --> 00:03:21,504
They don't know...

35
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:25,303
that we have him.

36
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:27,603
Who do you mean by him?

37
00:03:27,604 --> 00:03:29,103
Yes.

38
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:30,504
I'm sure of it.

39
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:34,704
I'm sure he will find us.

40
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:42,403
"Heiji Hattori No Way Out (Part 1)"

41
00:03:42,404 --> 00:03:45,404
"Mouri Detective Agency"

42
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:49,903
They're late.

43
00:03:49,904 --> 00:03:52,203
Heiji and Kazuha.

44
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:53,903
Yes.

45
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:57,203
The date was at 1:00 pm, but it's 2:00 pm already.

46
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,903
I wonder if anything happened.

47
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:01,603
Then, why don't you call them?

48
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:03,803
They carry a cell phone, don't they?

49
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:07,303
I called them, but it seems to be switched off.

50
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:11,303
They probably forgot, and are sleeping at home.

51
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:13,703
I called Heiji's mom,

52
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:16,603
and she said they took the 8:00 am plane right on time.

53
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:18,403
8:00 am?

54
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:22,403
They sure took such an early flight to arrive here in the afternoon.

55
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:25,903
I just remembered. They did say that they want to visit someone.

56
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:30,803
The guy worked for the Police Detective Toyama who is Kazuha's father.

57
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,503
Now, he's working for a private detective agency here in Tokyo.

58
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:36,803
His name is Mr. Kusukawa, and it seems that they're going to meet him.

59
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:40,603
Could he be Mr. Kusukawa at the Haido Detective Agency?

60
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:42,803
Huh? Do you know him?

61
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:44,003
Yes.

62
00:04:44,004 --> 00:04:45,803
Horse racing, motorboat racing, bicycle racing...

63
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:48,703
He loves to gamble.

64
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:53,203
Say, why did Heiji and Kazuha go meet him?

65
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:55,803
He sent Kazuha's father a letter

66
00:04:55,804 --> 00:04:58,303
saying he has an important matter to talk to him about,

67
00:04:58,304 --> 00:04:59,703
but he hasn't called since.

68
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:01,603
So, Kazuha's father got worried

69
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:03,603
and asked them to go see how he's doing.

70
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,703
Maybe they got busy talking about their father,

71
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:08,703
and forgot about the time.

72
00:05:08,704 --> 00:05:10,303
I wonder.

73
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:13,003
Well, I'll try call him up.

74
00:05:13,004 --> 00:05:16,403
"Haido Detective Agency"

75
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:19,403
Yes, this is Haido Detective Agency.

76
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:22,203
Mr. Mouri, how are you?

77
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:24,603
Huh? Kusukawa?

78
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:28,703
We haven't been able to get in touch with him for a couple of days now.

79
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,103
He said he was after a big case,

80
00:05:32,104 --> 00:05:35,503
so I suppose he is staking up somewhere.

81
00:05:35,504 --> 00:05:37,103
A big case?

82
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:40,403
Do you in a need of one more player to play mahjong?

83
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:43,703
No. We would like to know

84
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:47,603
if two high school kids called on Mr. Kusukawa.

85
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:50,903
Yes. They were here at about 10 am.

86
00:05:50,904 --> 00:05:53,803
A boy and a girl from Osaka, aren't they?

87
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:55,603
I told them Kusukawa is not in the office,

88
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:58,703
so after I gave them his address, they left.

89
00:05:58,704 --> 00:06:02,503
May I have that address, please?

90
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:05,003
Haido street, 4...

91
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:06,504
Arihato Apartment.

92
00:06:07,504 --> 00:06:09,803
Give me a break.

93
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:14,103
The hosts shouldn't have to search for the guests.

94
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:17,803
What's the problem? You're not busy anyway.

95
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:19,903
It's not okay.

96
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:22,703
I hope it stops raining soon.

97
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:25,203
You're going on an excursion tomorrow, aren't you?

98
00:06:25,204 --> 00:06:26,504
Yes.

99
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:31,403
Isn't that the Arihito Apartment?

100
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:34,903
Let me see. Mr. Kusukawa's room number

101
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:36,703
is number 202.

102
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:39,104
Room 202.

103
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:43,003
Room 202...

104
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:44,203
Huh?

105
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,103
"I'll be back by noon.

106
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:50,003
Deliver any packages to the landlord, please."

107
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:51,303
Hey, hey.

108
00:06:51,304 --> 00:06:54,003
It's way past noon already.

109
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:57,603
He is always behind time.

110
00:06:57,604 --> 00:07:02,103
Maybe he was here when both of them came by,

111
00:07:02,104 --> 00:07:05,003
and they went out together for a soda or something.

112
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:07,403
With the intention to come back by noon.

113
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:10,503
I saw a family restaurant on this way.

114
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:14,904
But it looks like Heiji kept waiting for a long time.

115
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:18,403
Look there, to the right of the paper.

116
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,004
You can see a set mark.

117
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:26,303
Doesn't it look like a mark of the cap Heiji usually wears?

118
00:07:26,304 --> 00:07:27,603
You're right.

119
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:30,103
This is the mark of Heiji's cap!

120
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:33,203
He must have put his cap on backwards

121
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:35,903
and leaned against the door while waiting for quite some time.

122
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:39,103
How do you know he kept waiting for a long time?

123
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:43,903
There's another mark of his cap left in a place just my height.

124
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:45,203
This means he got tired of waiting

125
00:07:45,204 --> 00:07:46,903
and squatted down while leaning against the door, doesn't it?

126
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:48,604
It seems so.

127
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,604
A Scotch tape?

128
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:55,103
I know what this is!

129
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:59,403
It's a mark to detect if someone tried to sneak into your house.

130
00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:00,503
Yes.

131
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:03,903
You see them in detective or spy movies.

132
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:06,303
But the tape is practically peeled off.

133
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:09,003
It shows that someone's snuck in here already, doesn't it?

134
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:12,003
It's possible that Mr. Kusukawa noticed it,

135
00:08:12,004 --> 00:08:16,304
got frightened, and rushed to the police.

136
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:21,703
But it seems this tape was peeled off a long time ago.

137
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:25,003
A lot of dust is on the sticky part.

138
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,403
Hey, hey.

139
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:30,403
Then, when did he put this paper on the door?

140
00:08:30,404 --> 00:08:34,103
Mr. Kusukawa intends to come back soon,

141
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:37,203
but for some reason he couldn't.

142
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:41,903
And while he was away, somebody broke into this room.

143
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:44,003
What shall we do, Dad?

144
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:46,103
What do you mean that?

145
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:47,804
Wait a second, Conan!

146
00:08:50,004 --> 00:08:52,703
It's not locked.

147
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:55,903
It's like as I said, somebody's snucked into this room already.

148
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:57,104
Hey...

149
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:02,503
The lock shows it was not forced open,

150
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:05,003
and the room doesn't seem to be ransacked.

151
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:07,903
Did he just forget to lock the door?

152
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:10,503
And that tape, too.

153
00:09:10,504 --> 00:09:14,304
I guess he forgot he put it there and opened the door himself.

154
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:19,403
Huh? What's this?

155
00:09:19,404 --> 00:09:21,003
What?

156
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:22,603
Look here.

157
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,803
He put something on the desk

158
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:28,103
and rubbed it over with a pencil which left the traces.

159
00:09:28,104 --> 00:09:29,604
What did you say?

160
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,504
Can it be this memo note?

161
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:37,603
There, the size just fits.

162
00:09:37,604 --> 00:09:39,303
I see.

163
00:09:39,304 --> 00:09:45,604
He rubbed over the traces the pencil made on the paper underneath.

164
00:09:46,604 --> 00:09:51,403
That Osaka boy must've been worried since Kusukawa was missing,

165
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:54,003
and the door was unlocked.

166
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:58,303
To figure out where Kusukawa was, that boy took the note with him.

167
00:09:58,304 --> 00:10:03,203
Well, the note that shows the letters are with him now.

168
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:06,203
So, we don't know what's written on it.

169
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:10,404
But I can see the letters if I rub it with a pencil.

170
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:12,404
Of course!

171
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:14,803
The pencil point pressed hard enough on the paper

172
00:10:14,804 --> 00:10:17,003
that it left traces on the paper two sheets below.

173
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:20,204
Let's see. Itou of Kenbashi street?

174
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:26,103
There's a phone number on it, too.

175
00:10:26,104 --> 00:10:28,503
But I can't make it out.

176
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:33,003
Could Hattori and Kazuha have gone there?

177
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:35,403
Then, let's go there and have a look.

178
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:38,304
We can ask for directions at a police box to help us find the house.

179
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:42,803
A couple of high school kids that speak in Kansai accent?

180
00:10:42,804 --> 00:10:45,103
They aren't here.

181
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,903
By the way, are you a police detective or something?

182
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:51,903
Oh, no. We are just looking for them.

183
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:54,103
Thank you very much.

184
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:58,303
Well, I didn't see any high school kids with a Kansai accent around here.

185
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:01,803
Aren't you Mr. Kogoro Mouri, the sleeping detective?

186
00:11:01,804 --> 00:11:04,203
A high school boy from Osaka?

187
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:08,803
Isn't the high school baseball tournament in Osaka is over?

188
00:11:08,804 --> 00:11:10,903
I don't know them or anybody else!

189
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,204
Why do you keep picking on me?

190
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:19,803
A boy and a girl with a Kansai accent?

191
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,303
They haven't been here.

192
00:11:23,304 --> 00:11:25,003
I thought so.

193
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:28,303
I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help.

194
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:30,203
That pin on your lapel.

195
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:32,303
It's an attorney's lapel pin.

196
00:11:32,304 --> 00:11:36,004
Excuse me, but are you Miss Misari Itou who is an attorney?

197
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:38,503
Seriously?

198
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:41,303
"Misari Itou" -Yes, I am.

199
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:43,603
My mother told me about you.

200
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:46,903
You're the admirable attorney

201
00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:49,103
who accepts all requests for a modest fee.

202
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:52,803
Then, is your mother also an attorney?

203
00:11:52,804 --> 00:11:56,703
-Yes, ma'am. -You are a blabbermouth, Ran.

204
00:11:56,704 --> 00:12:03,503
Well, do you happen to know a suspicious Itou residence around here?

205
00:12:03,504 --> 00:12:05,303
Suspicious?

206
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:06,603
Oh, that reminds me.

207
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:09,003
There's a building that bears a nameplate Itou.

208
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:13,803
It's right behind the elementary school on the 5th street.

209
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:17,603
Children have been saying that there's two men who looked like hobos

210
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,003
often come and go there at night.

211
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:21,303
That's it!

212
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:24,603
That's where they went, and so are we!

213
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:26,603
What? Are we?

214
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:28,503
Sure we are.

215
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:30,503
Let's go.

216
00:12:30,504 --> 00:12:32,603
Thank you very much, ma'am.

217
00:12:32,604 --> 00:12:33,804
You're welcome.

218
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:41,903
Okay, okay.

219
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:43,704
Let's go in, shall we?

220
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:55,503
You must be hungry.

221
00:12:55,504 --> 00:12:57,403
But could you wait for a little while, dear?

222
00:12:57,404 --> 00:12:59,304
Your mom is busy right now.

223
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:02,003
After I finish my work,

224
00:13:02,004 --> 00:13:04,304
I'll feed you. Okay, dear?

225
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:07,203
Good kitty.

226
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,603
Mommy has to go up to them

227
00:13:09,604 --> 00:13:12,603
and let them know where they stand.

228
00:13:12,604 --> 00:13:16,304
I've got to see to it that they feel it to the bones.

229
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:35,781
Oh, my. What a sight to see.

230
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,581
What happened to your handsome face? You're losing it.

231
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:41,381
This brat tried to shout,

232
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:44,481
and I caught him in time.

233
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:46,081
Heiji, are you alright?

234
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:47,481
Don't give in.

235
00:13:47,482 --> 00:13:49,781
You surprise me, boy.

236
00:13:49,782 --> 00:13:54,881
You're an acquaintance of the Kogoro Mouri.

237
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:57,181
You really know a lot of people,

238
00:13:57,182 --> 00:14:00,581
high school kid detective, Heiji Hattori, don't you?

239
00:14:00,582 --> 00:14:05,981
You've been invited here because of that great ability of yours.

240
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:07,781
So, do solve the cipher for us, will you?

241
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:11,782
That cipher that this stinking rat of a detective thought up.

242
00:14:14,182 --> 00:14:17,281
What a laugh. But I'm sure you agree with me, too.

243
00:14:17,282 --> 00:14:21,281
This guy had the nerve to preach me.

244
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:23,781
He asked me to stop instructing people how to evade taxes illegally.

245
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:26,981
He had the tape to prove my doings,

246
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:29,781
but didn't want to publicize it.

247
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:33,581
The tape is in the safe deposit box in Tohto Bank

248
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:39,281
with a seven digit number as an ID.

249
00:14:39,282 --> 00:14:43,681
Unfortunately, that's all he could tell us before he stopped breathing.

250
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:47,481
And that's when we got a call from this boy.

251
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:49,581
Excuse me.

252
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:52,181
I couldn't hear you very well because I have a ringing in my ear.

253
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,881
Give it a second thought, and tell me one more time.

254
00:14:55,882 --> 00:14:58,782
Who the stinking rat really is?

255
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:02,381
Heiji!

256
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:04,781
Don't get funny, boy.

257
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:08,081
So, you haven't learned your lesson well enough.

258
00:15:08,082 --> 00:15:11,282
Scrape his ears off, so he can hear better.

259
00:15:13,182 --> 00:15:14,382
Heiji!

260
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,182
Stop it, please!

261
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:26,781
Darn it.

262
00:15:26,782 --> 00:15:29,582
Why are there so many visitors today?

263
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:34,982
It's that little kid.

264
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:39,481
Hello, little one. What's the matter?

265
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:40,981
You forgot something?

266
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,081
No, ma'am.

267
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:46,081
I came back here because something bothers me.

268
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:47,282
Kudo!

269
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:50,081
What bothers you, dear little one?

270
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,881
The footprints of shoes.

271
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:56,581
There are so many wet shoe marks,

272
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,082
so I was wondering where all those people are in the house.

273
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:02,881
There were callers just a while ago.

274
00:16:02,882 --> 00:16:05,781
We talked in the hall and they left soon after.

275
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:07,981
So, right now I'm alone in this house.

276
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:11,281
-Then, those prints are strange, aren't they? -Huh?

277
00:16:11,282 --> 00:16:16,081
There are all marks for going in, but none for going out.

278
00:16:16,082 --> 00:16:18,381
Why?

279
00:16:18,382 --> 00:16:22,181
That's right. They are my footprints.

280
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,781
They stuck a gun at me in the hall.

281
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:27,281
I was handcuffed, then brought straight into this attic

282
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:28,682
and was confined.

283
00:16:30,382 --> 00:16:33,781
This is the footprint of my sneakers for jogging.

284
00:16:33,782 --> 00:16:34,981
They're yours?

285
00:16:34,982 --> 00:16:36,081
Yes.

286
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:38,681
I washed the mud off, and I'm drying the shoes in the bathroom.

287
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:40,581
That's why you don't see them here.

288
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,881
Conan!

289
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:44,981
What are you doing there?

290
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:47,981
You disappeared so suddenly, so we were worried about you.

291
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:50,781
They're looking for you, dear.

292
00:16:50,782 --> 00:16:54,382
You have to go find both of your friends, don't you?

293
00:17:00,282 --> 00:17:02,881
Do you want to get killed right now?

294
00:17:02,882 --> 00:17:04,581
What's that sound?

295
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:07,381
It came from upstairs.

296
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:08,481
Well...

297
00:17:08,482 --> 00:17:11,981
You said you are alone in the house, didn't you?

298
00:17:11,982 --> 00:17:14,681
I'll go upstairs and take a look.

299
00:17:14,682 --> 00:17:16,582
It may be a burglar!

300
00:17:26,682 --> 00:17:28,681
It's the cat I saw a while ago.

301
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:31,081
Oh, my. Naughty kitty.

302
00:17:31,082 --> 00:17:34,781
You shouldn't drop things down the stairs.

303
00:17:34,782 --> 00:17:37,181
She is very naughty.

304
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:40,181
She drops things and makes them go rolling down so often.

305
00:17:40,182 --> 00:17:43,781
She must've made that sound.

306
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:46,481
I have to go out now.

307
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,981
But if you insist,

308
00:17:47,982 --> 00:17:51,081
I can go with you and help you find the burglar.

309
00:17:51,082 --> 00:17:52,982
Come, let's go upstairs.

310
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:56,981
Putting on a kind front and try to deceive him.

311
00:17:56,982 --> 00:17:59,981
But Kudo won't fall for it, you fool.

312
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:04,482
Why don't you come on up, dear detective?

313
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:07,381
I think I'll go home!

314
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:09,081
Huh?

315
00:18:09,082 --> 00:18:10,481
Oh, really?

316
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:12,381
You don't have to worry about me, feel free to come up.

317
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,481
No, it's not that.

318
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:15,181
So long, ma'am.

319
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:17,481
Don't so long me. Hey, hey!

320
00:18:17,482 --> 00:18:19,682
So long, little one.

321
00:18:23,882 --> 00:18:26,781
He's gone I suppose.

322
00:18:26,782 --> 00:18:28,981
He sure scared me.

323
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,481
Sorry, guys.

324
00:18:30,482 --> 00:18:33,182
You expected them to come back, but only a little kid did, right?

325
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:38,081
Oh, no. What do you think you're doing?

326
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:39,781
He's really going home!

327
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:41,981
He must have his reasons.

328
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:43,781
Look, he's thinking something over.

329
00:18:43,782 --> 00:18:45,881
Take a good look at him, fool.

330
00:18:45,882 --> 00:18:47,381
He's being held tightly in her arms.

331
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:49,481
Although he's a bit ashamed, but he's glad at the same time.

332
00:18:49,482 --> 00:18:51,881
You can tell from his look. What a disgusting face.

333
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:56,982
In her arms? I'm talking about Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

334
00:18:58,282 --> 00:19:02,181
The old man is probably listening to the horse races live on the radio.

335
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,181
Now, leading by three to four lengths!

336
00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:07,281
Good, keep on leading to the finish!

337
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:08,581
Looks like we have no choice,

338
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:11,782
but to break this glass and make them notice us.

339
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:15,782
What are you trying to do, you brats?

340
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:17,581
Gosh.

341
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:19,582
This is becoming tiresome.

342
00:19:22,282 --> 00:19:25,181
Now, it's time for your homework.

343
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:27,881
You'd better make the most of your brain.

344
00:19:27,882 --> 00:19:30,981
You're the famous high school detective in Osaka.

345
00:19:30,982 --> 00:19:34,781
It should be easier for you than your math, right?

346
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,682
This is a simple cipher to you.

347
00:19:37,682 --> 00:19:38,981
Get to your work.

348
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:40,881
And be sure to solve it by sundown,

349
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:44,281
if you don't want end up like him.

350
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:47,482
You want to stay on this side of the world, don't you?

351
00:19:48,682 --> 00:19:50,481
What's the hurry?

352
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:53,281
Why don't we take time, relax and solve it?

353
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:56,981
Or is there anything to worry about tomorrow?

354
00:19:56,982 --> 00:19:59,581
Yes, there sure is.

355
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:03,581
He told us that the same cipher will be delivered

356
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:07,982
to his detective agency tomorrow by the delivery service.

357
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:10,981
He attached a letter that has a copy of the cipher

358
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:15,982
which is for the seven digit ID number to the Tohto Bank safe deposit box.

359
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,981
He was such an idiot.

360
00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:22,681
He assumed he was safe because of that arrangement,

361
00:20:22,682 --> 00:20:25,181
and he was arrogant enough to tell me

362
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,881
that he wouldn't say anything about it

363
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:30,882
if I stop giving instructions on illegal tax evasion.

364
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:34,381
I'm sure he was going to blackmail me

365
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:39,181
and use the money for gambling that he loved so much.

366
00:20:39,182 --> 00:20:41,581
-Gambling? -Oh, yes.

367
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:43,381
I remember Dad told me.

368
00:20:43,382 --> 00:20:46,381
Mr. Kusukawa is known for loving to gambling.

369
00:20:46,382 --> 00:20:49,281
Why didn't you tell me that before?

370
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:52,681
What? Did you find anything already?

371
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:56,281
Yes. Give me a little more time and leave me alone,

372
00:20:56,282 --> 00:20:57,982
I think I can solve it.

373
00:20:59,782 --> 00:21:01,481
Good for you.

374
00:21:01,482 --> 00:21:06,081
Then, we'll have tea downstairs and will wait for you.

375
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:08,781
So, you better make full use of your brain to solve it.

376
00:21:08,782 --> 00:21:12,181
And don't even think of running away from us.

377
00:21:12,182 --> 00:21:15,882
Sure. Wait for us without expecting anything from us.

378
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,681
It's alright now, Mr. Kusukawa.

379
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:27,781
What?

380
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:30,081
You're still alive, aren't you?

381
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:33,182
The floor dust underneath your nose just flew off.

382
00:21:36,982 --> 00:21:40,981
Just as expected of the son of the Director of Police Headquarters.

383
00:21:40,982 --> 00:21:44,882
I really was out of cold until just now.

384
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:49,281
You'd better keep pretending you're dead.

385
00:21:49,282 --> 00:21:50,881
If they find you alive,

386
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:55,181
they'll stick a gun at us and try to make you talk.

387
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:58,481
The answer to this cipher is just like you.

388
00:21:58,482 --> 00:21:59,981
Just like him?

389
00:21:59,982 --> 00:22:02,581
You mean you found the answer to the cipher, Heiji?

390
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:07,581
Yes, I did. The combination is easy to remember for a gambling fan.

391
00:22:07,582 --> 00:22:09,581
By the way, Mr. Kusukawa,

392
00:22:09,582 --> 00:22:12,381
is this the only copy of the cipher?

393
00:22:12,382 --> 00:22:13,781
It is.

394
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:16,881
They didn't make any copy of it.

395
00:22:16,882 --> 00:22:18,981
Good for us.

396
00:22:18,982 --> 00:22:22,682
Just great for the gamble we're about to take.

397
00:24:00,782 --> 00:24:02,081
"Next Episode"

398
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:04,081
What's this?

399
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:06,181
Numerals and four alphabets.

400
00:24:06,182 --> 00:24:08,381
Q, A, K, J.

401
00:24:08,382 --> 00:24:09,781
Could it be...

402
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,581
Huh? Conan, did you find out something?

403
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:13,982
Yes. A little.

404
00:24:15,682 --> 00:24:17,682
Dice steaks?

405
00:24:18,882 --> 00:24:20,981
A red circle.

406
00:24:20,982 --> 00:24:24,681
I've got it. That's why the center was a nine.

407
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:30,782
Next Conan, "Heiji Hattori No Way Out (Part 2)"
