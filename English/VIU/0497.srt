1
00:00:01,438 --> 00:00:04,438
Rena Mizunashi, is the only clue we have to closing in

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,838
on the Black Organization.

3
00:00:06,838 --> 00:00:08,138
Eisuke Hondo, who has an older sister that looks exactly like her,

4
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:11,438
is on the search for her and his whereabouts become unknown.

5
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:13,338
We also find out that he underwent surgery for leukemia

6
00:00:13,338 --> 00:00:14,838
when he was a child.

7
00:00:14,838 --> 00:00:18,238
That boy had leukemia!

8
00:00:18,238 --> 00:00:20,538
Furthermore, a member of the Black Organization

9
00:00:20,538 --> 00:00:23,138
sneaks into the hospital that she is staying in.

10
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:25,938
I met all three suspects in person

11
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:28,338
and tracked down who the one that snuck into the hospital was.

12
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:34,538
The only possibility left is probably the one lying,

13
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:37,338
saying that he has fainting spells and nausea because of his sprained neck

14
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:40,538
and is extending his hospital stay.

15
00:00:41,938 --> 00:00:44,338
And that man is Rikumichi Kusuda.

16
00:00:44,338 --> 00:00:46,338
There's only him.

17
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,838
Should we nab him right away?

18
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:51,338
No. Let's watch him for a while.

19
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:54,938
We can nab him after he gives himself away.

20
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:56,038
Although very slight,

21
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:58,538
there's a possibility that he's an ordinary patient

22
00:00:58,538 --> 00:01:01,038
who's after insurance money too.

23
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:04,938
Well, I think it's safest if we watch him with a lot of men,

24
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:07,438
and as soon as he makes any queer moves, we nab him.

25
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:08,738
Right.

26
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,038
By the way,

27
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:16,538
please think seriously

28
00:01:16,538 --> 00:01:19,338
about moving Rena Mizunashi to another hospital.

29
00:01:19,338 --> 00:01:20,338
Yeah.

30
00:01:20,338 --> 00:01:23,538
I'll go talk it over with the head of the hospital now.

31
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:25,538
I'll ask him whether he has any doctor acquaintances,

32
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:28,738
who is understanding and can keep secrets.

33
00:01:28,738 --> 00:01:30,938
I'd sure like to move her somehow

34
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:32,938
before we nab Kusuda, though.

35
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:35,338
Maybe we should take her to the States with us after all then.

36
00:01:35,338 --> 00:01:37,638
Don't be ridiculous.

37
00:01:59,838 --> 00:02:01,338
Sizzling hot suspense.

38
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:02,838
A red scream and black bullet

39
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:03,938
whizz through the darkness.

40
00:02:03,938 --> 00:02:05,938
The Black Organization finally finds out

41
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:07,838
where Rena Mizunashi a.k.a Kir are!

42
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:09,338
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,138
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:13,738
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

45
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:44,978
"Red and Black Crash: Awakening."

46
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:48,102
"Haido Central Hospital."

47
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,502
Well, should I check the second floor?

48
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:52,402
Yes, thank you.

49
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:54,502
Could you check on Mr. Chikada for me too?

50
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:55,902
All right.

51
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,402
"Nurse Station."

52
00:04:14,802 --> 00:04:19,402
My, Mr. Nezu's nurse call again at this time of night.

53
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:22,602
I wonder if it's a mistake again?

54
00:04:41,402 --> 00:04:43,902
Mizunashi.

55
00:04:43,902 --> 00:04:45,202
She not in this hospital ward either.

56
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,502
Hey, you? What're you doing?

57
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:51,802
I got lost.

58
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:54,102
I was looking for the men's room.

59
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:58,802
Oh. It's down the stairs right up ahead.

60
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:00,602
Thank you.

61
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:10,102
Come on, hurry up and do what you have to do

62
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,702
and go back to your room!

63
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:13,002
Here.

64
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:16,902
Thank you.

65
00:05:21,402 --> 00:05:25,702
Isn't it kind of strange, nurse?

66
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:27,502
I mean if you look at this camera,

67
00:05:27,502 --> 00:05:30,102
it's only natural for you to imagine that

68
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:33,802
I was in the nurse station taking pictures of something

69
00:05:33,802 --> 00:05:36,402
and yet, you're letting me get away with it.

70
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:40,202
Who the heck are you?

71
00:05:48,702 --> 00:05:50,402
FBI.

72
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:56,002
Put both hands around your head in clear view

73
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:57,902
and get down on your knees!

74
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:02,002
FBI?

75
00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:03,602
Which means that the place Rena Mizunashi

76
00:06:03,602 --> 00:06:07,702
is taking her beauty nap is here in this hospital.

77
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:10,502
Yes. We were going to let you go about a bit,

78
00:06:10,502 --> 00:06:13,302
and grab more conclusive evidence

79
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:15,202
but I guess it wasn't necessary.

80
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:17,302
Come on, hurry and get down on your knees

81
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:19,402
before you wake up the other patients!

82
00:06:19,402 --> 00:06:22,902
I guess I'll wake them up, then.

83
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:28,602
By setting this C4 off!

84
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:32,202
A plastic bomb!

85
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:33,802
Don't move!

86
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:37,102
Or I'll blow this entire floor up.

87
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:41,302
Don't move! Don't you dare move.

88
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,602
I'm sure that he's going back to his room

89
00:06:45,602 --> 00:06:47,102
to remove any evidence

90
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:49,402
and will flee through the window!

91
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:51,402
Get outside so he doesn't get away!

92
00:06:51,402 --> 00:06:52,602
Okay!

93
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:57,902
No? He didn't go back to his room,

94
00:06:57,902 --> 00:06:59,602
but instead went out the emergency exit to the parking lot

95
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:01,502
and got in his car?

96
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:02,902
He foresaw our plan?

97
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:15,502
Shu!

98
00:07:20,102 --> 00:07:22,102
We're counting on you, Akai!

99
00:07:23,702 --> 00:07:26,802
We've got to somehow manage to nab him

100
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:28,702
before he contacts the Organization!

101
00:07:28,702 --> 00:07:32,502
Roger. But, we won't be able to stop him from doing so,

102
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:34,202
if he has the cell phone on him now.

103
00:07:34,202 --> 00:07:36,002
Don't worry!

104
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:41,802
I looked for his cell phone while he was out of his room

105
00:07:41,802 --> 00:07:44,102
and sunk it in water.

106
00:07:45,702 --> 00:07:48,902
Darn! Doesn't work at a time like this?

107
00:07:53,402 --> 00:07:56,202
You didn't believe us?

108
00:07:56,202 --> 00:07:58,602
I just wanted to be 100% sure.

109
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:00,602
But, I'm sure that you already foresaw that rushing to nab him

110
00:08:00,602 --> 00:08:02,702
by openly keeping an eye on him

111
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:05,602
would probably bring about this result.

112
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:08,602
Right, Mr. Akai?

113
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:11,802
Well, I wonder about that.

114
00:08:30,702 --> 00:08:34,502
Oh, Akai... Shuichi?

115
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:46,802
You stopped him?

116
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:50,402
You stopped him from contacting the Organization?

117
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:58,602
But he got away to the world beyond with a gun.

118
00:08:58,602 --> 00:09:01,302
If he committed suicide shooting himself,

119
00:09:01,302 --> 00:09:04,002
the bomb that he had on him was just a bluff.

120
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,402
But, thank god the whereabouts of Rena Mizunashi

121
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:07,802
is still not known.

122
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:08,902
No.

123
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:13,502
Now, they know for sure where she is.

124
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:15,902
I'm sure that he was in some way

125
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:18,802
reporting his investigation results of this hospital

126
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:21,102
on a regular basis to the Organization.

127
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,502
So, if he had been making the report ever day

128
00:09:23,502 --> 00:09:27,102
and it stopped coming in completely.

129
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:30,702
They'll come, maybe as soon as tomorrow.

130
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:32,202
Those guys!

131
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:38,002
Haido Central Hospital,

132
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:41,802
that's where they caged Kir up.

133
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:43,202
Yes.

134
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:45,802
The man that we snuck into that hospital

135
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:47,702
suddenly stopped reporting back,

136
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:50,902
so we made another man go check out what was going on.

137
00:09:50,902 --> 00:09:52,902
Then, there they were, a whole lot of them.

138
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:59,302
FBI agents on guard, hiding here and there all over the place.

139
00:09:59,302 --> 00:10:03,402
I guess they increased the number of agents, thinking that we found out.

140
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:07,002
You owe me gratitude.

141
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:11,102
Because I'm the one who got information that Kir was hurt badly

142
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:14,702
and taken to a hospital somewhere.

143
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:20,102
It seems that the FBI has that kid in custody though.

144
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:22,002
He's only a kid.

145
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:26,002
I guess it wouldn't hurt to leave him as is for now, no?

146
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:29,402
But, how do you propose we get Kir out,

147
00:10:29,402 --> 00:10:33,202
from the hospital that the FBI is guarding so tightly?

148
00:10:33,202 --> 00:10:34,502
Any false moves and we risk the existence

149
00:10:34,502 --> 00:10:36,702
of the Organization being disclosed to the public.

150
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,702
True.

151
00:10:38,702 --> 00:10:41,102
It'd be hard to snatch Kir away from the FBI

152
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:43,802
as if nothing ever happened.

153
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:45,402
That is, if we were to snatch her away.

154
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:50,202
Huh? Just what do you mean, boss?

155
00:10:50,202 --> 00:10:52,102
Don't worry, Vodka.

156
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:54,502
I've made quite a few arrangements already.

157
00:10:55,602 --> 00:11:00,002
Well, I warn you, do be careful, Gin.

158
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:03,902
Silver Bullet is on their side with the sharp eyes of an eagle.

159
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:07,502
Shuichi Akai.

160
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:12,702
That FBI agent that skimmed my cheek bone with a lead bullet.

161
00:11:12,702 --> 00:11:16,102
I'm going to use this incident against him and get rid of him.

162
00:11:16,102 --> 00:11:17,902
You're shooting him?

163
00:11:17,902 --> 00:11:19,402
Yeah.

164
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:22,802
I don't know what that person is afraid of about him,

165
00:11:22,802 --> 00:11:24,802
but one silver bullet

166
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:29,302
doesn't have a chance against a cannon.

167
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:36,202
No. Silver Bullet who is able to pierce through

168
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:40,402
the Organization (Our) heart has one more bullet.

169
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:44,725
Move! We've got to move!

170
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:47,825
Now that they know Rena Mizunashi is here,

171
00:11:47,825 --> 00:11:50,425
we can't stay here anymore!

172
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:52,425
We've got no time to be debating over the matter, do we?

173
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:57,725
But we can't just haphazardly move her around when she's in a coma,

174
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:02,125
not even having a definite hospital where she can be hospitalized.

175
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,225
Besides, if we move now,

176
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,925
it's more likely we'll end up with bullet-ridden bodies.

177
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:11,725
The agent who's guarding the back area says

178
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:14,125
he verified a suspicious figure squirming around

179
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,625
on the roof of the next building.

180
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,625
Then, the Organization is already...

181
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,825
We've got to tell the hospital head about this

182
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,725
and think up some strategy right away.

183
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:27,125
No. I don't think that's a good idea.

184
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,925
If we explain the situation and make him cooperate,

185
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,825
it would look as if the hospital

186
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:36,925
sheltered Rena Mizunashi to begin with.

187
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:41,225
However, if the hospital makes no move despite the circumstances,

188
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:43,925
they may conclude that this hospital is an ordinary hospital

189
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:48,025
that has nothing to do with the FBI.

190
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:51,825
True, now that it's turned out this way,

191
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:54,625
maybe that's the only way we can protect the hospital.

192
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,525
But, there are many patients

193
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,125
who cannot move from here, you know?

194
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:03,025
We can't just do nothing and wait when we know that

195
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:06,225
the guys of the Organization will be raiding this place.

196
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:07,925
We're not just going to wait.

197
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:09,225
We're pulling out.

198
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:10,925
Pulling out?

199
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:13,025
You mean we're leaving her behind and pulling out?

200
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,325
No.

201
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:16,725
We're pulling out the strings and waiting.

202
00:13:18,225 --> 00:13:20,025
Let's meet our enemy, the black wolves,

203
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:25,025
who will come to get their comrade who has gone astray.

204
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:27,825
I guess we have no other choice.

205
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:32,325
After all, we did summon more agents over this afternoon.

206
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:34,525
If I knew it were going to turn out this way,

207
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:36,925
I shouldn't have stopped the guy who took pictures

208
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:39,225
in the nurse station.

209
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:41,125
I just didn't want him to give the Organization

210
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,425
information on the patients who are not involved.

211
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:46,925
Well, they would've found out either way

212
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:51,325
because Conan seems to have destroyed his cell phone.

213
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:54,725
No, the boy destroyed the cell phone

214
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:58,625
not to keep the guy from contacting the Organization

215
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,425
but rather to find out how to get in touch with them.

216
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:04,025
If the guy locked himself in the restroom or his room

217
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:07,325
and used the cell phone mail to make contact,

218
00:14:07,325 --> 00:14:10,125
there's no way he could've figured out how contact was being made.

219
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,725
But if the cell phone is destroyed,

220
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:15,225
he would be forced to choose a different method.

221
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:16,325
I see.

222
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:18,925
If the method he chooses to make contact is something we can see,

223
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:22,325
like at a phone booth or an internet cafe,

224
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:24,025
we would be able to find out to who,

225
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:26,925
in what words and writing style he was making contact with.

226
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:30,025
Therefore, we would be able to keep in touch with them,

227
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:32,925
pretending to be him even after nabbing him.

228
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:36,825
Yes. In other words, we, not this boy, are the ones who goofed.

229
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:40,625
We, the FBI.

230
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:45,425
That includes me, who never even thought of something like that.

231
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:52,225
Let's rest in shifts and wait prepared for them!

232
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,925
If we keep on being uptight,

233
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:57,325
we'll be had it before those guys get here.

234
00:14:57,325 --> 00:15:00,025
Yes, you're right.

235
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:03,025
Well, if I come up with a good idea to counter them,

236
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:06,125
I'll come over and let you know about it.

237
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:10,225
What do think about Shu?

238
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:12,125
What do you mean what do I think?

239
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,925
I can't help feeling that he almost feels happy

240
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:18,625
about the Organization raiding this place.

241
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,925
If I said I didn't feel the same way, I'd be lying.

242
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:24,725
If he gets to confront the Organization,

243
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:28,325
he'll be given a chance to avenge her death too.

244
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:30,225
Avenge her death?

245
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:33,325
Shu's girlfriend was killed

246
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,725
several months ago, by them.

247
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:36,925
His girlfriend

248
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:39,425
seems to have been connected with the Organization.

249
00:15:39,425 --> 00:15:43,425
Shu said that she was killed because she tried to quit the Organization.

250
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:46,425
Why was Mr. Akai going with a girl like her?

251
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:48,825
In order to close in on the Organization.

252
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:50,125
Although it seems that

253
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,925
she wasn't all that deeply involved with the Organization but,

254
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:56,425
it seems that her younger sister was one of the scientists there.

255
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:58,725
Younger sister? A scientist?

256
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:02,825
Yes. Akai became acquainted with her younger sister,

257
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:06,825
and started making connections with the people around her.

258
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:09,025
Then, he eventually succeeded in sneaking in.

259
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:10,725
Although only for three years,

260
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:13,325
he was a member of the Organization

261
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:18,225
under the alias of Dai Moroboshi from 5 years ago until 2 years ago.

262
00:16:18,225 --> 00:16:22,225
He really did a good job within the Organization.

263
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:23,825
He kept a low profile to start

264
00:16:23,825 --> 00:16:26,425
and gradually started showing his horns.

265
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:31,225
He was given the code name "Rye" and eventually go to work

266
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:35,525
with one of the executives of the Organization called Gin.

267
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,625
Gin.

268
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,525
We, the FBI figured that so long as we mark that man,

269
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:42,825
we would be able to get to their boss,

270
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:46,125
so, we went to their gathering site beforehand

271
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,425
and hid there waiting.

272
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:51,425
But they didn't come.

273
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:54,025
Although we waited till the break of day.

274
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:56,525
Don't tell me that they found out that he was an FBI agent.

275
00:16:56,525 --> 00:17:01,025
Yes, by a slight mistake that the agent who was staking out made.

276
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:04,225
So, Shu was brushed off by the Organization, you see!

277
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:07,125
Then, Mr. Akai's girlfriend was killed then?

278
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,725
Nope.

279
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:11,225
It seemed that her younger sister

280
00:17:11,225 --> 00:17:14,225
was an important person to the Organization

281
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:16,525
that they couldn't lay a hand on her.

282
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:20,925
Shu thought likewise and it seems he never met her since.

283
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:23,525
Well, even if he wanted to contact her,

284
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:26,825
he couldn't since their address was moved since then

285
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:29,325
and he had no way of getting in touch with them.

286
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:32,025
The Organization, however, would never leave

287
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:35,025
a woman who pulled in an FBI agent,

288
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:38,225
and may still in the future contact him, to roam free.

289
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,325
Therefore, not being able to take it any longer,

290
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,325
the Organization makes her an offer.

291
00:17:42,325 --> 00:17:43,925
They tell her that if she carries out a certain job,

292
00:17:43,925 --> 00:17:47,825
they will let her as well as her younger sister leave them.

293
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:49,525
Of course, the condition was that if she fails,

294
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:53,225
she and her younger sister would have to die.

295
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:56,225
It seems that the Organization wanted to kill her saying that

296
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:58,825
she was killed for failing to do the job right, but...

297
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:04,625
She succeeded in carrying out the job of stealing 1 billion yen

298
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,925
and ended up being killed for no reason.

299
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:10,725
What was her name...

300
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:13,025
Her real name was Akemi Miyano.

301
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,225
Alias, Masami Hirota.

302
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:16,725
I'd never forget.

303
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:20,025
So, she was no doubt Haibara's older sister.

304
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,825
That scientist must've been Haibara!

305
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:27,625
The reason we know about this in such detail is because.

306
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,525
Akai got a mail from her on his cell phone,

307
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:33,925
the day before she carried out this job.

308
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:37,325
Since she found out two years before, that he was an FBI agent,

309
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,425
he was not once contacted by her.

310
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:44,625
She probably couldn't forget Akai even after finding out that

311
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:48,125
she was used by the FBI.

312
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:53,925
And judging from how Akai acted after she died.

313
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:59,225
Yes. Shu also probably liked her.

314
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:32,625
I'm sorry! I was careless!

315
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:36,025
No, I was absent-minded too.

316
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:39,625
Doesn't your head hurt? How about your body?

317
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,525
I'm fine.

318
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:43,325
I'm glad!

319
00:19:43,325 --> 00:19:45,425
I'll go get the doctor right now!

320
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:46,525
Hey!

321
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,625
What's your name?

322
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,925
Akemi Miyano.

323
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:56,125
I'm Dai Moroboshi.

324
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,825
Nice to meet you.

325
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:00,825
Same here!

326
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:03,825
Dai.

327
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:07,925
If I get to quit the Organization after this job,

328
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:12,325
will you go out with me as my real boyfriend?

329
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,125
"Dai, if I get to quit the Organization after this job"

330
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,525
"will you go out with me as my real boyfriend? Akemi."

331
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,925
Hey.

332
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:27,625
May I talk to you for a while?

333
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,825
If you're thinking of the strategy to counter-attack them,

334
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:32,025
I'm still thinking about it.

335
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:36,025
But, I was looking at you, and thought

336
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:41,225
that maybe you're thinking exactly what I'm thinking.

337
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:51,325
Time to rest.

338
00:20:51,325 --> 00:20:54,125
-We've got a long night. -Oh, yes.

339
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:05,425
Mr. Akai! An emergency session will be convened.

340
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:09,725
-Strategy meeting? -Yes.

341
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:15,725
I hope we've got a good strategy.

342
00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:34,325
Hey, get up, Rena Mizunashi.

343
00:21:35,525 --> 00:21:37,425
If you don't wake up,

344
00:21:37,425 --> 00:21:41,625
I can't ask you how my older sister Hidemi is doing!

345
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,725
Hey, get up! Please get up!

346
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:46,225
You're going to be taken somewhere again, aren't you?

347
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:49,925
Before that happens! Please open your eyes! Hey!

348
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:55,425
I'm telling you, open your eyes. Hey, do you hear me?

349
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:02,125
No. Ei-chan.

350
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:09,325
Wait, are you one of the agents that have been summoned here?

351
00:22:09,325 --> 00:22:12,225
Yes.

352
00:22:12,225 --> 00:22:14,025
I'm Andre Camel!

353
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:16,325
I just happened to get a call from my wife.

354
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:18,425
Then, please hang up quickly!

355
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:20,225
We're having a strategy meeting!

356
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:27,925
Yes, just as planned.

357
00:23:54,525 --> 00:23:57,925
The Black Organization makes their move.

358
00:23:57,925 --> 00:24:03,225
We launch a strategy to get Rena Mizunashi out of the hospital

359
00:24:03,225 --> 00:24:05,125
and get a threatening declaration of war

360
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,725
from the Black Organization.

361
00:24:08,325 --> 00:24:11,725
Simultaneously, multiple accidents happen one after the other,

362
00:24:11,725 --> 00:24:14,325
and the hospital is thrown into great panic!

363
00:24:16,325 --> 00:24:19,125
Next on Detective Conan,

364
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:23,025
"Red and Black Crash: Confusion."

365
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,425
Next Conan's Hint:

366
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:42,825
Planter.

367
00:24:42,825 --> 00:24:44,925
Next week's episode is another exciting one!

368
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:46,325
