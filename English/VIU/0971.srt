1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,520
Aiko...

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,980
Aiko...

3
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,750
From: Aiko Subject: Goodbye

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:22,870
Damn!

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,570
This is their fault!

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,880
Their fault!

7
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,920
Their fault!

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,300
Their fault!

9
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,819
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

10
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,719
The rhythm of my detective skills is perfect!

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,179
While love blossoms at the MPD, black malice approaches!

12
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,859
Always determining the one truth

13
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,689
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

14
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,010
his name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:00,030
Target: MPD Transportation Department (Part One)

16
00:03:00,577 --> 00:03:02,006
I'm late!

17
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:05,887
This isn't good! Yumi-san's going to be mad!

18
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:11,048
I'm sorry!

19
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:12,968
Huh? You...

20
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:15,718
What? No way! Chiba-kun?

21
00:03:16,018 --> 00:03:17,877
Are you...?

22
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:19,298
Y-Yes?

23
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:21,247
Are you...?

24
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:22,478
Yes?

25
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:24,927
Are you maybe...?

26
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:25,888
Yes?

27
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:37,738
Oh, no!

28
00:03:37,988 --> 00:03:38,958
I'm actually late!

29
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,378
See you later!

30
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:45,887
The light's always so long when you're in a hurry.

31
00:03:45,888 --> 00:03:47,748
I can't be late.

32
00:03:48,338 --> 00:03:49,748
No one's looking.

33
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:53,218
There aren't any cars. Maybe I'll cross.

34
00:03:55,128 --> 00:03:56,878
The light is red!

35
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:00,758
Who cares? There isn't a single car.

36
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:03,057
No one's watching.

37
00:04:03,058 --> 00:04:04,437
I'm watching.

38
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:06,558
And you're watching, too.

39
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:11,398
Once you go easy on yourself and break the rules, it becomes a habit.

40
00:04:11,828 --> 00:04:14,398
Habits are hard to break even if you want to.

41
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:17,158
Do you not even understand that?

42
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,218
No, no. Be patient.

43
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:35,657
Hey, you're the mini patrolwoman's henchman.

44
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:37,177
It's Naeko-san.

45
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:38,587
Henchman?

46
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:40,807
You're up early.

47
00:04:40,808 --> 00:04:44,998
We're up early because it's our turn to feed the rabbits.

48
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,938
Is something happening?

49
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:51,987
It's traffic month at the MPD. We're tightening supervision.

50
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:52,628
All right.

51
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:55,227
Don't! The light's still red.

52
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,988
But there aren't any cars.

53
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:01,567
Doesn't this symbol mean kids can cross?

54
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:05,917
No, this sign is a warning to drivers to be careful

55
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,788
because there's a school, kindergarten, or nursery school nearby.

56
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:15,338
Most road signs are divided by color and function.

57
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:19,338
Yellow signs like this one are warnings.

58
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:21,968
Red means danger or prohibition.

59
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:25,737
Easy-to-read blue signs are for directions.

60
00:05:25,738 --> 00:05:31,598
Calming green signs that are easy on the eyes are used to guide people to emergency exits.

61
00:05:31,838 --> 00:05:36,717
Think of it as the same as a traffic light's red, yellow, and green.

62
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:38,157
Huh.

63
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:41,738
You certainly are a female officer of the traffic department.

64
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:44,857
The shapes have meaning, too.

65
00:05:44,858 --> 00:05:49,017
Circles that appear larger than they are for prohibitions or regulations.

66
00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:54,637
Triangles or squares with points at the top look unstable and draw your attention,

67
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:56,497
so they're for warnings and regulations.

68
00:05:56,498 --> 00:06:01,758
Solid stable-looking squares are for direction and guidance.

69
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:06,258
I'm sure you'll learn about it at school soon.

70
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:09,827
Make sure you follow traffic rules.

71
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,308
Okay!

72
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:14,308
The rules...

73
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:17,317
The rules...

74
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:18,313
Everyone should follow them! Follow the rules!

75
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:19,438
The rules!

76
00:06:22,868 --> 00:06:26,198
What? You got hit on again?

77
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:28,077
During a stakeout?

78
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:29,817
Yeah.

79
00:06:29,818 --> 00:06:35,728
Apparently the clothes I always borrow from your friend make me look easy.

80
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,977
You're right.

81
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:44,088
The clothes you wear to stakeouts always have a kind of devilish aura about them.

82
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:48,847
Well, as long as I don't look like a cop, it's okay.

83
00:06:48,848 --> 00:06:51,907
So, what'd you do with the guy who hit on you?

84
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:55,858
Naturally, I drove him off by secretly showing him my badge.

85
00:06:56,648 --> 00:07:00,108
I told him, "Don't you think you're hitting on the wrong woman?"

86
00:07:00,398 --> 00:07:04,357
But weren't you on a stakeout with Takagi-san at the time?

87
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:05,168
Yeah.

88
00:07:05,648 --> 00:07:11,527
Then couldn't you have chased them off by saying he's your boyfriend?

89
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:13,037
Oh, well...

90
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:15,417
You're not wrong,

91
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:20,668
but I once actually did that to tease Takagi-kun, and...

92
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:24,157
Oh, uh, it's not that I'm her boyfriend,

93
00:07:24,158 --> 00:07:28,178
but we're actually here on a stakeout...

94
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:33,058
He panicked, and everyone in the area figured out that we were cops.

95
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:35,947
So we can't use that strategy.

96
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:38,027
Oh, Takagi-san.

97
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:39,347
I know.

98
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:43,068
Takagi-kun's always so fun to tease.

99
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:45,597
Speak of the devil.

100
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:46,818
Sato-san!

101
00:07:47,328 --> 00:07:50,057
What are you doing here?

102
00:07:50,058 --> 00:07:52,198
Inspector Megure was looking for you.

103
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:55,208
Ch-Chiba-kun!

104
00:07:57,898 --> 00:08:02,508
Oh, no! I had pot stickers for lunch today, so my breath might stink!

105
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:08,167
By the way, is the newbie who went out on the stakeout with you feeling better?

106
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:10,888
No, his allergies have gotten worse since then.

107
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,267
He's at home asleep today.

108
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:16,537
Well, I can conduct a stakeout on my own.

109
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:21,818
If you're short a man, how about her?

110
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:31,158
Y-You...

111
00:08:31,438 --> 00:08:33,158
Y-Yes?

112
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:35,947
You wouldn't be good on a stakeout.

113
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,397
You'd just look like a middle schooler being admonished by an officer.

114
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:42,918
A middle schooler? But we're the same age.

115
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:45,077
Chiba, what are you doing?

116
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:46,068
Let's go.

117
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:47,178
Coming.

118
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:52,817
Chiba-kun...

119
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:53,888
Jeez.

120
00:08:54,268 --> 00:09:01,167
Miwako proudly declares her love, but you're absolutely hopeless.

121
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:03,007
Yeah, but...

122
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:05,028
Feel like singing, Miike?

123
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,528
At karaoke, after work.

124
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:11,837
I'll sing! Let me sing with you!

125
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:14,708
All right. Toko, will you come with us?

126
00:09:15,718 --> 00:09:19,018
You bet I will.

127
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,937
Yumi, how about you?

128
00:09:20,938 --> 00:09:24,477
I'll pass. I've got stuff to do tonight.

129
00:09:24,478 --> 00:09:26,537
Is it your shogi master boyfriend again?

130
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:28,838
Yeah, something like that.

131
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:31,617
They added the new Eio title,

132
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:37,838
so I have to talk Chukichi into getting it so he can be a septuple crown master.

133
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:39,848
Eio

134
00:09:48,228 --> 00:09:58,047
For now I don't really want to think about the future

135
00:09:58,048 --> 00:10:03,977
No one can be greater than you

136
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,628
Even though you're [important]

137
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:09,498
Hey, Shiori.

138
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:12,497
Anything strange happen to you lately?

139
00:10:12,498 --> 00:10:13,957
Anything strange?

140
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,107
Like being followed by someone.

141
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:18,967
Come to think of it, since about a week ago.

142
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:21,348
Seriously? You, too?

143
00:10:23,668 --> 00:10:27,108
But we'll be fine. We're strong.

144
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:30,767
Besides, you're a third dan judoka.

145
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:32,455
Well, yeah.

146
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,298
And I'll go running to you now

147
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:42,117
Are you okay? Can you handle her?

148
00:10:42,118 --> 00:10:43,668
I'll be fine.

149
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:48,548
Chiba-kun... You big dummy...

150
00:10:53,688 --> 00:10:56,047
Hey, Miike. Miike!

151
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:57,987
Come on, Miike.

152
00:10:57,988 --> 00:11:00,907
Can you walk home? Can you make it?

153
00:11:00,908 --> 00:11:03,438
I'm totally fine!

154
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:11,658
Excuse me.

155
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:19,037
I've been hearing the sound of a small girl crying in the park bathroom for a while.

156
00:11:19,038 --> 00:11:21,448
Could you go check it out?

157
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:24,788
I wanted to ask the police,

158
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,458
but there isn't a police box in the neighborhood.

159
00:11:28,678 --> 00:11:30,287
Got it.

160
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:32,658
Could you take me to that park?

161
00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:36,468
Beika Higashi Park

162
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:39,767
I don't hear anything.

163
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:43,478
It was coming from the women's bathroom in the back.

164
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:46,478
Hello?

165
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:50,078
Is someone there?

166
00:11:58,308 --> 00:12:02,548
I knew it. I'd sensed an odd presence recently.

167
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,977
I'm a cop.

168
00:12:05,978 --> 00:12:09,748
Looks like you chose the wrong target for your trap.

169
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,168
I didn't choose wrong.

170
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:29,858
I didn't choose the wrong target!

171
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:52,037
Hey, kids.

172
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,647
Yumi-san!

173
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:57,678
You're such good kids to raise your hands while you walk in the crosswalk.

174
00:12:57,908 --> 00:13:01,657
Naeko-san told us about traffic rules yesterday.

175
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:04,207
So we did a bunch of research.

176
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:08,188
Kids are hard to see because they're small, so they raise their hands, right?

177
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,688
Really? Miike, huh?

178
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:16,647
Japanese road signs are based off of English ones, right?

179
00:13:16,648 --> 00:13:17,438
What?

180
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:20,597
Is that right? Miike, did you know that?

181
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:23,448
Yes. That's what I learned.

182
00:13:23,728 --> 00:13:27,357
Anyway, you guys are working early.

183
00:13:27,358 --> 00:13:29,577
It's traffic month, right?

184
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:31,577
Yeah, something like that.

185
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:34,917
We're looking out for your safety.

186
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:37,307
Thank you for your service, boss!

187
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:39,538
This is nothing!

188
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:42,058
I'm the boss!

189
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:44,938
Hey, we should get going.

190
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:46,938
MPD to all stations.

191
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:53,037
The body of a woman bludgeoned to death was discovered at Beika Higashi Park.

192
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:55,518
All patrols in the neighborhood, please head to the location.

193
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,424
No way. That's nearby.

194
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:01,397
Let's head there to preserve the crime scene.

195
00:14:01,398 --> 00:14:04,617
Right, like controlling curious onlookers.

196
00:14:04,618 --> 00:14:07,968
Don't be late, kids.

197
00:14:10,138 --> 00:14:11,857
It's at Higashi Park.

198
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:15,717
We still have time before first period, right?

199
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:17,257
Should we go, too?

200
00:14:17,258 --> 00:14:18,548
Let's go.

201
00:14:18,748 --> 00:14:20,298
Hey, guys!

202
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:25,798
Man, you're hopeless.

203
00:14:26,178 --> 00:14:28,007
We're just going to check it out, okay?

204
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:30,308
Yeah!

205
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:34,427
You're the one who wants to go the most, Kudo-kun.

206
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:35,598
It's obvious.

207
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:43,518
Sato-san!

208
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:45,167
It's no use.

209
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:50,578
We didn't find anything in the area that would help us identify the victim.

210
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:53,037
Maybe the suspect took it.

211
00:14:53,038 --> 00:14:57,608
Does that mean this was a robbery?

212
00:14:58,688 --> 00:15:00,518
N-No!

213
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:04,588
M-Momosaki-san! Momosaki-san!

214
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,188
Momosaki-san...

215
00:15:09,128 --> 00:15:10,167
You knew her?

216
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:11,368
She's a colleague.

217
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,237
I thought I recognized her.

218
00:15:14,238 --> 00:15:15,898
So she was a cop.

219
00:15:16,138 --> 00:15:17,977
Momosaki Toko.

220
00:15:17,978 --> 00:15:23,898
Like us, she worked for the MPD Transportation Department as a sergeant.

221
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:27,678
But she was a third dan judoka. How could this happen?

222
00:15:28,838 --> 00:15:33,578
Come to think of it, weren't you going to karaoke with Momosaki and Yagi last night?

223
00:15:34,778 --> 00:15:36,007
Miike!

224
00:15:36,008 --> 00:15:40,067
Yes, but I got drunk.

225
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:45,928
I only remember Yagi-san, who went with us, walking me home.

226
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,308
Where was the karaoke box?

227
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:55,217
Karaoke Beika on fourth street, across from the planetarium that's being remodeled.

228
00:15:55,218 --> 00:15:57,188
That's right over there.

229
00:15:57,338 --> 00:16:03,677
Then maybe she was attacked while trying to use the park bathroom.

230
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:09,187
But if the suspect bludgeoned a third dan judoka to death,

231
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:13,498
it's possible they're quite strong as well.

232
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:20,717
Or they knew she was a cop and planned a countermeasure.

233
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:21,498
What?

234
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,468
This bent 100 yen coin next to the body...

235
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:30,888
What if it wasn't a coincidence, and the suspect left it there deliberately?

236
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:35,017
So it was a premeditated crime.

237
00:16:35,018 --> 00:16:38,508
Maybe it was the work of someone who bore some financial resentment.

238
00:16:38,938 --> 00:16:42,748
We'll have to canvas the area to gather information,

239
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:47,568
but for now, our only clue is this 100 yen coin.

240
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:48,568
No...

241
00:16:49,378 --> 00:16:51,738
There are other clues, too.

242
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,447
Conan-kun?

243
00:16:53,448 --> 00:16:55,977
Look at her left hand.

244
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:58,427
There's nothing on her pointer finger,

245
00:16:58,428 --> 00:17:03,457
but there's a scrape along the first joint of her middle, ring, and pinkie fingers.

246
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,597
And...

247
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:05,758
Hey, wait.

248
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:10,638
If you flip it over, there's a scrape along the bottom of her palm, too.

249
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:15,018
But there aren't any signs that her body was dragged.

250
00:17:15,528 --> 00:17:20,148
Which means her left hand was actually shaped like this

251
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:22,768
and placed against the ground like this.

252
00:17:27,268 --> 00:17:29,078
What you doing?

253
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:33,827
She probably got these scrapes

254
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:38,708
when someone kicked it towards her feet.

255
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:43,257
So she was trying to tell us something by pointing somewhere?

256
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:44,668
At what, though?

257
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:48,188
Look at the tip of her pointer finger.

258
00:17:48,978 --> 00:17:51,078
See the little bit of blood on it?

259
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:52,718
You're right.

260
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:58,177
Maybe that means she knew the culprit would move her hand

261
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:01,197
no matter what she pointed at,

262
00:18:01,198 --> 00:18:04,978
so she used her own blood to leave a fingerprint.

263
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,288
Look!

264
00:18:11,228 --> 00:18:14,467
There's a stain from where her bloody finger scraped against it.

265
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:18,918
In other words, she was actually pointing in that direction.

266
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:23,117
A swing set?

267
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:24,128
Yeah.

268
00:18:24,578 --> 00:18:25,767
What does that mean?

269
00:18:25,768 --> 00:18:28,098
What? Uh...

270
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:33,638
Yumi.

271
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:38,058
Who else was with the victim at the karaoke box last night?

272
00:18:38,488 --> 00:18:43,147
Lieutenant Yagi Shiori also of the Transportation Department was with them.

273
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:44,357
Right?

274
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:45,537
Yes.

275
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:47,127
Where is she now?

276
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:49,247
Yagi's got the day off.

277
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:52,568
Since it's still early, she's probably at home.

278
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:54,428
I see. Got it.

279
00:18:54,928 --> 00:18:58,377
Someone go to Lieutenant Yagi's place immediately.

280
00:18:58,378 --> 00:18:59,258
Yes, ma'am.

281
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:00,828
Oh, uh...

282
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:05,247
By the way, what are you kids doing here?

283
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:09,357
We ran into Yumi-san and Naeko-san in their mini patrol car while on our way to school.

284
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:12,008
We heard about the case on the radio.

285
00:19:12,578 --> 00:19:15,147
How did you get here?

286
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:17,887
We came immediately when we heard the radio,

287
00:19:17,888 --> 00:19:20,327
but you were already investigating the crime scene.

288
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:24,657
Sato-san and I happened to be conducting a stakeout in the area.

289
00:19:24,658 --> 00:19:26,978
We'd just finished when we got the call.

290
00:19:28,698 --> 00:19:32,488
So you were with Detective Sato all night last night.

291
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:34,637
We were working, okay?

292
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:36,238
I know...

293
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,747
Yeah, that's right.

294
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:48,378
Last night, Toko, Miike, and I went to karaoke.

295
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:54,868
I said I'd walk Miike home since she was drunk and parted ways with Toko in front of the store.

296
00:19:55,388 --> 00:19:58,638
I had no idea this would happen afterwards.

297
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:02,607
It looked like she was trying to stop by the park bathroom.

298
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:03,857
That's odd.

299
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:08,358
Toko used the bathroom just before we left the karaoke box.

300
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:11,148
Then what was she doing in a park?

301
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:15,778
Was there anyone who resented her?

302
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:21,387
Last night she said she felt like she was being followed starting about a week ago.

303
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,228
And?

304
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:26,288
But that was the only time we discussed it.

305
00:20:26,738 --> 00:20:27,548
I see.

306
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:31,997
Do you know anything about a swing set?

307
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,188
A swing set?

308
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:40,678
She pointed at that swing set just before she died.

309
00:20:46,438 --> 00:20:48,848
What? Did you remember something?

310
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:55,328
I don't know.

311
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:59,358
I could be wrong, so I'll call you once I'm sure.

312
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:05,748
Well, I need to tell Toko's friends about what happened.

313
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:07,118
Yagi!

314
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:11,498
You've got the day off. You should stay home.

315
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:13,758
Yeah, I know.

316
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:30,148
The body discovered in the park belonged to Sergeant Momosaki Toko,

317
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:35,148
a member of the Transportation Department like Yumi-san and Naeko-san.

318
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:40,147
The evidence left behind included a bent 100 yen coin

319
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:42,038
thought to have been placed next to the body by the culprit.

320
00:21:42,658 --> 00:21:49,028
There's also the park's swing set the dying Momosaki-san indicated with blood.

321
00:21:49,988 --> 00:21:54,668
The culprit and the victim both left separate messages.

322
00:21:54,998 --> 00:21:58,158
But we still haven't found the clue

323
00:21:58,688 --> 00:22:02,838
to decipher what either of them mean.

324
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:04,348
And later,

325
00:22:04,678 --> 00:22:11,848
we'd learn this was only the beginning of this case.

326
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:49,497
Three of the traffic violators they fined

327
00:23:49,498 --> 00:23:52,618
made a bunch of complaints.

328
00:23:54,188 --> 00:23:55,758
Very nice.

329
00:23:56,298 --> 00:23:58,378
I'm impressed you found this place.

330
