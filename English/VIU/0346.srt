1
00:00:02,164 --> 00:00:04,064
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,064 --> 00:00:06,064
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:07,564
Starting the year off is the Youth Detective Squad.

4
00:00:07,564 --> 00:00:09,464
Genta's rear end is more important than the monkey's rear end.

5
00:00:09,464 --> 00:00:11,264
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,064
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,064 --> 00:00:15,264
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,933
Hey! Is it for real

9
00:01:57,933 --> 00:02:00,733
that you and Haibara were almost kidnapped?

10
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:03,933
Yes. But we somehow made it through safely.

11
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:06,533
The kidnapper got away though.

12
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:08,933
I'm really glad for you both!

13
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:10,233
Since you both recovered from your cold

14
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:12,233
and got to come to school!

15
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:14,333
We were really worried about you!

16
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,633
Thank you.

17
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:17,233
I'm perfectly fine now.

18
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:21,133
We actually wanted to go see you but...

19
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:23,633
Conan insisted that we shouldn't go see you

20
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:26,333
because we'd catch your cold. Right?

21
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,333
Yes!

22
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,333
Oh. Is that so?

23
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:33,133
We even decided on what time to go see you and yet...

24
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:34,733
Exactly!

25
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:37,133
Now that I'm relieved, I'm starved.

26
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:38,333
Not again!

27
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,633
Hey.

28
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,633
Are sure it's really safe?

29
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:44,933
For me to go outside.

30
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:46,833
Yeah, pretty much.

31
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,133
For now.

32
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,833
What do you mean "pretty much"?

33
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,233
I removed all the wiretap that was set up

34
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,733
in Dr. Agasa's house.

35
00:02:55,733 --> 00:03:00,633
In fact, I went browsing around here alone last night.

36
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:02,333
Disguised as you.

37
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:07,833
I asked mom to help me disguise as you once more!

38
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,333
Shinichi. You look just great!

39
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,133
What do you think?

40
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,733
You think so.

41
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:17,633
Doing something dangerous like that on your own again.

42
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:19,133
There was nobody watching me

43
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:22,333
or anybody suspicious following me.

44
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:25,333
Well, I wouldn't say that it's completely safe,

45
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,633
but I'm not the type who can stayed locked up

46
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:29,933
just because I'm scared.

47
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:33,733
I decided to believe her words for now.

48
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,833
I lost.

49
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,533
I'll give up going after Sherry.

50
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:39,933
Her words?

51
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:43,233
Besides, you pretty much recovered too, haven't you?

52
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:46,533
Isn't it because pressure from those guys disappeared?

53
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:56,333
"Look for the Mark on the Buttocks (Part 1)"

54
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,833
What? An FBI agent?

55
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,233
Sonoko!

56
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,333
Really?

57
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,333
Sonoko.

58
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,533
But! You mean Jodie is?

59
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,733
-No kidding? -Sonoko!

60
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:15,233
This is a hospital! Be quiet!

61
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:16,233
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:17,533
Don't worry about it.

63
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:20,933
Why'd you think of working as an English teacher in Japan?

64
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:23,233
Don't tell me that you're an undercover agent investigating something?

65
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:24,833
Sonoko...

66
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,433
No. No!

67
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,233
Oh. That's not it.

68
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,233
There was a culprit I was after for a long time,

69
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:33,933
but I carelessly lost track of that person.

70
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:36,433
So, I was given time off from work for a while,

71
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:38,333
that's why I came to Japan!

72
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:44,833
I really love Japanese games!

73
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,133
-Games? -Games?

74
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,633
I became an English teacher,

75
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:52,433
because I always wanted to be one for a long time!

76
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:55,633
But, my time off has come to an end!

77
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:57,833
As soon as the wound on my stomach heals,

78
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,533
I have to head back to America!

79
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,133
Then, the treasure map

80
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,933
you said you'd been looking for all this time is...

81
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:07,133
I got a call from my boss telling me to come home

82
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,433
because they got a clue to the culprit

83
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,733
that I've been looking for!

84
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:13,033
He said he's going to give me a chance

85
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,333
to make things right again!

86
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,533
I see.

87
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:21,333
I wanted to say goodbye to cool kid before leaving too

88
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,233
so I went to Dr. Agasa's house.

89
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,233
That's when I saw cool kid and Ai

90
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:28,233
being pushed into the car and taken away

91
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:29,733
by some suspicious looking people,

92
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,333
so I went after them with my car!

93
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:37,733
And I cornered them by a pier.

94
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,533
They suddenly fired a gun at me.

95
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:43,733
So, I did likewise!

96
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,333
Of course, the gun was what I had taken

97
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,733
from the suspicious people!

98
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:51,433
But, I was definitely lucky!

99
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:55,033
That Mouri was hiding in the trunk of the car.

100
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:57,133
And that she protected Ai.

101
00:05:57,133 --> 00:06:00,233
Because back then, I was shot in the stomach

102
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:02,933
and couldn't move.

103
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:05,633
Moreover, the kidnappers were planning

104
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:09,733
to give up kidnapping and kill the children!

105
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:11,133
Really?

106
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:12,233
Yes.

107
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:16,333
I found the pictures of Conan and Shinichi hidden and pasted

108
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,833
behind the mirror in the restroom of Jodie's condominium.

109
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,933
So I went to Jodie's place to ask her about them.

110
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:27,033
But, she wasn't home so I was ready to leave

111
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:30,633
when I saw her car in front of her condominium.

112
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:33,133
The trunk of the car was open so I took the liberty of...

113
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:36,333
So, you took the liberty of... I mean you know.

114
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,233
But I'm sure glad

115
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,633
that you weren't a bad person after all, Jodie!

116
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:46,633
I mean, I thought that you were involved in some way

117
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:47,933
with the case that Shinichi is involved in.

118
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,633
And that you were being threatened by the culprit

119
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:50,833
to take pictures of Shinichi

120
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:54,933
to find out what his weaknesses were.

121
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:56,733
I had every mind to confront the culprit directly

122
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,433
and beat him up.

123
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:00,933
Hey, Ran! Are you serious?

124
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,833
I mean the things you think of are so unreal!

125
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,933
Oh! Those pictures that are pasted there

126
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:10,033
are people that I've befriended in Japan!

127
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:11,233
What?

128
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:14,933
I actually had them pasted on the living room board,

129
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,133
but when one of my Japanese friends came over,

130
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:19,133
she had a queer look on her face

131
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:21,533
so I decided to move the pictures over to where they are now!

132
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:22,733
I see!

133
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,533
Americans often have pictures of their families

134
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:29,033
all over the desk at their work place too.

135
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,633
It's not too customary to do something like that in Japan

136
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:34,233
so I guess it's only natural that it would be thought of as odd.

137
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:37,733
Come to think of it, even when I went to watch an opera in New York.

138
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:40,033
The actresses had a lot of pictures pasted all over the mirror

139
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:43,333
of their dressing room.

140
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,633
You mean the time when you and Shinichi

141
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:47,733
were attacked by the serial killer!

142
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,133
Take care.

143
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:53,033
Because I've heard that they appear in this area recently too!

144
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:55,133
-We will. -We will.

145
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,633
Somebody's here.

146
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:03,533
I guess we'd better be going then.

147
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,933
I hope you get well soon, Jodie!

148
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:07,833
Thank you so much, both of you!

149
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,233
-Please excuse us. -Please excuse us.

150
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:14,833
How are you doing?

151
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,633
All right, somehow...

152
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:19,933
the shot fortunately missed my vital point.

153
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,933
By the way, were the Japanese police

154
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:24,233
convinced with the explanation we gave them?

155
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:25,333
Yeah.

156
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,733
After hearing the siren of the police car,

157
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:31,633
one of the kidnappers took the boy hostage and fled.

158
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:35,433
Then he disappeared leaving the car and the boy behind in the forest.

159
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:38,233
The other one whose leg was fractured

160
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:40,733
committed suicide with the gun he had on him.

161
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,133
Unfortunately,

162
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:44,033
since it was the dark, neither you nor the children

163
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:47,633
could see the face of the kidnapper who fled.

164
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:52,333
Of course I made both children say the same thing.

165
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:56,833
I didn't want to create a sensation by publicizing that

166
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,133
the kidnapper was actress Chris Vineyard after we failed to arrest her

167
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,833
on top of not knowing what the actual motive of the kidnapping was.

168
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,133
We also felt bad about making you work undercover here

169
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:09,933
without acquiring permission from the Japanese police, so...

170
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:15,533
The problem is that girl who was called Sherry by that woman.

171
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:22,533
I wonder if she'll accept

172
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:24,533
our request?

173
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,833
Well, it seems like the FBI is in on this too

174
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:35,333
so I'm sure they can't make any moves that easily either!

175
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,533
Come to think of it,

176
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:39,333
Dr. Agasa said that you got a phone call from Jodie

177
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,633
this morning.

178
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:42,933
What did she want?

179
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:47,033
Was it to verify whether we didn't contradict each other?

180
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:49,633
Well, I guess so.

181
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,133
I'll be frank with you.

182
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:58,533
We would like you to accept the witness protection program.

183
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,933
Back then, Chris Vineyard.

184
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,333
Yes. The lady called Vermouth,

185
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,533
tried to kill you to keep you from talking.

186
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,433
In other words, it's obvious that

187
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:14,433
you have information that she finds very inconvenient.

188
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:16,633
About the witness protection program,

189
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:19,233
I think you already know it from movies and novels.

190
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:22,333
It will change everything from your name, background and address

191
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,533
to a totally different identity

192
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:26,233
in order to protect you

193
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:28,733
from the people who are after your life.

194
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:30,133
You will be guaranteed sufficient income

195
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:33,733
and other miscellaneous things from the country for life

196
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,533
and I will see to it that you get to live a happy life.

197
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:39,733
Of course whether you want to accept this or not is up to you.

198
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,033
However, once you accept it,

199
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:45,933
you will not be able to see or call your family and friends.

200
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:49,633
If you're afraid of that woman coming after you in revenge,

201
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:53,833
if you don't want to get your friends involved,

202
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,733
I'll be waiting for you to give me a good answer.

203
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,633
What's up Haibara?

204
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:01,533
Maybe because of her cold.

205
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:03,033
No, that's not it.

206
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:04,833
It's been a while since I came outside,

207
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,033
so I'm just a bit tired.

208
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,133
Then, bye. Because I'm going this way.

209
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:10,433
See you tomorrow!

210
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:11,933
I'll see you at school!

211
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:13,133
Okay!

212
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:20,633
"I feel great."

213
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:25,133
"Splashing in the rain."

214
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:40,333
It hurts...

215
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,633
Serial Killer!

216
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,733
Somebody, get him!

217
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,633
It's Ayumi's voice.

218
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:05,933
-What's up? -Ayumi!

219
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,133
Ayumi?

220
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:13,701
I see.

221
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:16,901
So, you don't remember that person's face.

222
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:18,301
Yes.

223
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:22,901
It was raining and he was wearing my raincoat and hat.

224
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:26,401
Besides, I was so scared I couldn't look at the person's face!

225
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:28,601
Even the lady victim who got her armed slashed

226
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:30,701
didn't see the culprit's face.

227
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:33,901
Judging from the way things look,

228
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:35,101
the culprit is probably the same as the one

229
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:37,301
who committed the other three previous cases.

230
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:39,501
But, the outfit is different.

231
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:41,801
I heard the person shout.

232
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:43,801
I'm sure it was a man!

233
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:48,401
But, you can't really tell just from a shouting voice.

234
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,501
Either way,

235
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:53,001
let's go to the scene of the crime and do an inspection!

236
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:55,801
Maybe you'll remember something.

237
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:56,801
Okay!

238
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:00,701
I bumped into the serial killer over here.

239
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:03,101
We heard Ayumi scream

240
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:05,101
so we came running over!

241
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:08,001
Which means that the culprit ran away

242
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:09,401
because you and the others came?

243
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:11,301
No!

244
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:13,701
He ran away before that!

245
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:14,901
Really?

246
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:18,201
Before he ran away, he came towards me once,

247
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:19,501
so I was surprised but...

248
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:20,801
He came towards you?

249
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:21,801
Yep!

250
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,201
I heard a clinking sound afterwards

251
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:26,501
so I'm sure he picked something up!

252
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:29,401
Maybe he dropped loose change or something?

253
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:32,801
Maybe it was his glasses or house key.

254
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:36,801
It could've been a necklace or bracelet.

255
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:40,201
Do you know what the culprit picked up?

256
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:41,501
No.

257
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:45,201
I think it has something to do with the number 5!

258
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:46,901
The number 5?

259
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:49,701
Because there's a mark that looks like the number 5

260
00:13:49,701 --> 00:13:52,401
on the palm of my hand!

261
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:54,801
I looked around the area after that

262
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,701
but I saw nothing on the ground.

263
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:58,701
Can you draw a picture of the mark for me?

264
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:00,101
Yes, I can.

265
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,701
It looked like this.

266
00:14:05,701 --> 00:14:10,101
It doesn't look like a 50 yen coin or a 500 yen coin either.

267
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:13,601
It kind of looks like the letter S of the alphabet too.

268
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:16,801
Well, I'll try go look for traces of this mark.

269
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,701
It could be a mark left behind by some coin

270
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:23,301
from a slot machine game center or something.

271
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:28,601
There he is!

272
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,601
-What? -Why you!

273
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:32,701
Excuse us!

274
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:34,401
Don't let him get away!

275
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:40,701
Darn it! It's so hard to get through with so many onlookers.

276
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:43,001
There he is! The man in the raincoat!

277
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:45,701
There's the serial killer.

278
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:48,401
Wait! That's...

279
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:50,101
Why you...

280
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:55,201
It's Officer Takagi.

281
00:14:57,201 --> 00:15:00,601
Geez! She's right, it's Officer Takagi.

282
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:01,801
It hurts...

283
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,001
What a thing to do.

284
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:05,501
Hey, Officer Takagi.

285
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:08,701
Didn't a man wearing a raincoat come running this way?

286
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:11,801
There are so many of them here.

287
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:14,301
Because it just stopped raining.

288
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:16,101
But, how bold.

289
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:18,601
To come back wearing a raincoat to the site of the crime,

290
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:20,701
knowing that the police are conducting investigations.

291
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:21,701
Yeah.

292
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:25,001
The culprit probably thinks that no one would expect him

293
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:26,901
to come back in the same clothes.

294
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:29,401
Don't tell me that he came back to take revenge thinking

295
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:31,001
that Ayumi had seen his face?

296
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:32,801
No way.

297
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:34,601
He probably came back because he was positive

298
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,001
that she didn't see his face!

299
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,301
For what?

300
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:39,801
Beats me.

301
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:41,201
He may have forgotten something at the site

302
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:43,601
that he shouldn't have left behind.

303
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:45,501
Or, maybe he came back to confirm something.

304
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:49,001
Darn it. I'm all wet.

305
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:51,301
At any rate, we'll have to figure out

306
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:53,601
what this mark that Ayumi drew is.

307
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:55,201
Hey!

308
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:57,901
Genta?

309
00:15:57,901 --> 00:16:00,001
Your buttocks, Genta.

310
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,101
What? Is it ripped or something?

311
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:03,701
That's not it!

312
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:06,201
The mark that the serial killer left behind is there!

313
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,601
What? No kidding?

314
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:12,501
That means he must've come in contact with the culprit somewhere.

315
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:15,501
Genta, please try and remember!

316
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:17,001
Where were you?

317
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:21,301
Please answer, Genta!

318
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:23,301
Where did you get that mark on?

319
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:26,901
The mark of the serial killer that is on your buttocks!

320
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:30,101
I wonder if this is really a mark left behind by the serial killer?

321
00:16:30,101 --> 00:16:31,201
Yes!

322
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:35,001
It looks just like the mark on the thing that the culprit dropped!

323
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:37,601
I coincidentally pressed my hand against it,

324
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:38,701
when the culprit got flustered,

325
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:40,401
came back to get it and then fled.

326
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:44,001
After that, the same mark was left on the palm of my hand.

327
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:46,801
Which means that Kojima touched the culprit

328
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:49,801
or the culprit's belongings somewhere along the line.

329
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,301
It could've been when you went after the culprit

330
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:54,801
who was among the crowd

331
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:57,101
and wearing a raincoat, went fleeing!

332
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:59,401
But...

333
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:02,601
Although I did trip over the bag of somebody in the crowd,

334
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:05,101
staggered and bumped into a bicycle,

335
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:07,201
it wasn't the culprit!

336
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:09,101
Besides...

337
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:13,801
It's nothing.

338
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:17,801
Could it be that the mark that was on the bag and the bicycle

339
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:21,401
were the same as the mark on the culprit's belongings?

340
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:25,801
If so, it could've been a name brand item.

341
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:27,501
Let's go back to the site

342
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:29,901
and ask the people in the area!

343
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:32,001
Besides the owners of the bag and the bicycle

344
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:34,001
may still be there.

345
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:40,101
Officer Sato...

346
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:42,001
Yes.

347
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:43,601
Come on, Conan. Let's go!

348
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:45,201
Yeah.

349
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:46,701
It's strange.

350
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:50,801
-The mark that is on Genta's buttocks. -The mark...

351
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:52,101
looks familiar.

352
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:55,901
Oh! There!

353
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:59,001
I tripped over this man's bag!

354
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:02,301
But there's nothing that looks like that mark on the bag.

355
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:04,901
Besides, the bag isn't dirty at all

356
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:06,701
so I don't think this is the one.

357
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:09,001
Because the mark on Genta's buttocks

358
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,901
looked to be soiled with mud.

359
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:12,701
If he was soiled with mud,

360
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:14,801
maybe the bicycle is a better bet?

361
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,801
And, where is that bicycle?

362
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:20,101
There she is!

363
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:21,401
She's the lady!

364
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:26,801
It's true that it is soiled with mud but...

365
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:29,701
The mark doesn't seem to be there.

366
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:31,901
Where on earth did you get

367
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:35,001
that number 5 or the letter S looking mark on you?

368
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:37,701
It's neither a 5 nor a S.

369
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,401
The mark that is on the palm of Ayumi's hand

370
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:41,601
and Genta's buttocks

371
00:18:41,601 --> 00:18:44,601
is a reverse and mirrored image of the actual shape.

372
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,101
In other words, the actual shape

373
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:49,001
is a shape that is the opposite of the number 5 or letter S.

374
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:50,501
Oh, I see!

375
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:53,201
And what about the size of the mark?

376
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:57,301
If that something left this big a mark on Ayumi's palm,

377
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:59,701
I think that she would have an idea of what it is.

378
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:03,201
No. Mine was much smaller!

379
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:06,501
It was here. About the size of a one yen coin!

380
00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:12,201
Which means that the two were the same mark on separate things.

381
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:14,001
If it was that small,

382
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:16,901
it could've been an accessory of the same brand.

383
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:18,201
Mirrored image.

384
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:21,001
Accessory.

385
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:22,801
The mark on the sleeve.

386
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:24,701
Don't tell me that...

387
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,001
Officer Sato?

388
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:34,601
This! It's this mark!

389
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,301
The car...

390
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,601
Yes.

391
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:39,901
After I drove through a muddy road,

392
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:41,101
I didn't wash the car

393
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:42,601
so those traces were left behind.

394
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:46,501
Come to think of it, you were sitting on the hood of Officer Sato's car,

395
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:48,201
weren't you, Genta?

396
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:49,801
Yeah...

397
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:52,101
Why didn't you tell us right away?

398
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:55,201
Well, it crossed my mind to begin with

399
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:56,801
but I didn't say anything.

400
00:19:56,801 --> 00:20:00,101
But I thought it can't be...

401
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:03,801
that Officer Sato was a serial killer!

402
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:06,801
I'm not!

403
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:11,201
The culprit probably has the same model car as I do!

404
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:14,301
Then, the mark that was on my palm...

405
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:17,301
Is the key to the car of this model!

406
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,901
The car's master key that has a cover

407
00:20:19,901 --> 00:20:21,901
with the mark etched on it.

408
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:23,401
See!

409
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:24,701
No kidding!

410
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:28,201
As proof of it, look at the tip of Ayumi's sleeve!

411
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:31,001
See the zigzag vertical lines on it?

412
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:33,701
-Yes. -True.

413
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:37,001
That's probably because there was dirt on the tip of the key

414
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:38,201
and when it was pressed against her hand,

415
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:41,101
traces of it stuck on to the tip of her sleeve...

416
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:43,301
No, it's not dirt.

417
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:46,501
It's discolored and black, but this is...

418
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:48,001
Blood?

419
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:52,701
Maybe the reason why the culprit came back here is...

420
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:54,001
Yes.

421
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:59,001
Probably to check whether Ayumi saw this mark.

422
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:01,401
And after seeing our undercover police car,

423
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:03,301
the culprit probably figured out that

424
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:05,401
it would be a matter of time before everything is disclosed.

425
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:08,801
Then, we'd better hurry or the culprit will get away!

426
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:11,401
Officer Takagi, get a hold of Inspector Megure

427
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:13,401
and have him set up a cordon!

428
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:17,401
Check all the drivers that are driving cars with the same mark

429
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,901
that are trying to leave this area!

430
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:20,401
Yes!

431
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:23,001
Also check all the residents in this area

432
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:25,901
who own the same car model!

433
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:28,301
If the culprit is a person who will risk coming back to confirm

434
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:31,101
whether the model of his car had been specified,

435
00:21:31,101 --> 00:21:35,701
it's likely that he has a parking space or storeroom nearby!

436
00:21:35,701 --> 00:21:37,501
Okay!

437
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:41,101
But, what if there are many cars like it?

438
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:42,901
It'd be very hard looking for it.

439
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:46,301
No, I don't think there are that many.

440
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:50,201
The model of this car with this mark on the key

441
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:52,701
and body is pretty old and manufacturing of it

442
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:54,501
stopped about seven or eight years ago.

443
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:56,801
Besides, it was raining when the crime was committed.

444
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:58,201
If we were to search for a culprit whose car is wet in the rain,

445
00:21:58,201 --> 00:22:01,701
with no alibi and who has lost his master key,

446
00:22:01,701 --> 00:22:03,901
the criteria for the search would be drastically narrowed down.

447
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:06,701
Why doesn't the culprit have the master key?

448
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,801
He probably had it but dropped it.

449
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:11,701
A blood stain in the shape of a key

450
00:22:11,701 --> 00:22:13,801
was left on the sleeve of Ayumi's outfit.

451
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:17,101
This serves as proof that the culprit grabbed the key with hands

452
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:20,101
soiled with the blood of the victim and fled!

453
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:24,201
This means that the culprit will not show the police the key,

454
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:27,201
which he knows will display haematological response!

455
00:23:56,701 --> 00:24:00,401
"Next Episode" -Just what does this mean, Officer Takagi?

456
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:04,501
You said so confidently that this would specify the culprit.

457
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:08,301
Silly. It's not the key that's being checked.

458
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:10,901
There's a possibility that the culprit would come

459
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:13,401
to take revenge on anyone who was involved with you too.

460
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:15,801
I'll go see him, after all.

461
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:18,001
Open the door, will you?

462
00:24:19,801 --> 00:24:20,801
Bye-bye.

463
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:23,001
Next Conan,

464
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:26,701
"Look for the Mark on the Buttocks (Part 2)"

465
00:24:42,601 --> 00:24:44,601
Next Conan's Hint:

466
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:46,701
"Key cylinder"

467
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:48,301
-The next episode... -Genta's buttocks...

468
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:49,901
-Stop it! -Genta's buttocks...

469
00:24:49,901 --> 00:24:51,601
Genta's buttocks
