1
00:00:01,547 --> 00:00:03,247
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:03,247 --> 00:00:05,447
After the tears is a yellow sunflower.

3
00:00:05,447 --> 00:00:07,047
A sudden sad tragedy.

4
00:00:07,047 --> 00:00:08,447
No matter how well something is hidden,

5
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:10,147
the sunflower witnesses it all.

6
00:00:10,147 --> 00:00:11,547
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,547 --> 00:00:13,147
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:15,247
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:01,637 --> 00:02:02,737
Inspector!

10
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:03,837
Mr. Mouri.

11
00:02:07,637 --> 00:02:12,937
I heard that Ms. Hiroko Inoue was murdered.

12
00:02:12,937 --> 00:02:15,437
Is the victim an acquaintance of yours?

13
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,637
Mr. Takaoka.

14
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:21,237
I don't know what to say.

15
00:02:21,237 --> 00:02:24,137
I wanted her to lead a happy life from now on.

16
00:02:24,137 --> 00:02:27,737
"Akira Takaoka, age 35" -What a thing to happen at such a time.

17
00:02:27,737 --> 00:02:30,537
I understand how you feel.

18
00:02:30,537 --> 00:02:34,237
Who could've done something as ruthless as this?

19
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:42,937
And, Inspector.

20
00:02:42,937 --> 00:02:44,837
What is the estimated time of death?

21
00:02:44,837 --> 00:02:46,637
According to the coroner,

22
00:02:46,637 --> 00:02:49,437
it seems to be between 11am to 1pm today.

23
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:07,637
Sunflower...

24
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:10,437
Hiroko used to like this flower.

25
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:13,537
Hey, you saw the culprit, didn't you?

26
00:03:13,537 --> 00:03:15,137
Who was it?

27
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:18,037
The one that did this to her.

28
00:03:18,037 --> 00:03:20,137
Who the heck was it, anyway?

29
00:03:26,137 --> 00:03:31,937
"Yellow Alibi"

30
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:36,537
Hiroko used to run a bar called Sunflower.

31
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:39,137
I used to go there too.

32
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:40,637
Sunflower?

33
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,137
Yes, she used to say that she liked sunflowers,

34
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:45,637
because they stand tall facing the sun

35
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:49,037
and watching them gave her courage.

36
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:51,637
That's why she said she named her shop after them.

37
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:53,237
"Bar Sunflower"

38
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:56,437
I visited the shop yesterday too.

39
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:57,937
And at that time she said that...

40
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,337
"Hiroko Inoue, age 38" -she finally found happiness.

41
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:03,237
She really looked so happy.

42
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:04,837
Cheers...

43
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:06,737
Finally found happiness?

44
00:04:06,737 --> 00:04:07,937
Yes.

45
00:04:07,937 --> 00:04:10,837
She and Mr. Takaoka...

46
00:04:10,837 --> 00:04:12,537
they're going together.

47
00:04:12,537 --> 00:04:14,337
He worked on directing independent films

48
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,637
for the past seven years.

49
00:04:16,637 --> 00:04:19,537
But just recently, a large movie company...

50
00:04:19,537 --> 00:04:23,237
asked him to direct a film for them.

51
00:04:23,237 --> 00:04:24,537
Oh...

52
00:04:24,537 --> 00:04:25,937
I think it's going to be a movie featuring the crying sand

53
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:28,237
that's found on White Sand Beach

54
00:04:28,237 --> 00:04:31,337
in his homeland in Fukushima prefecture.

55
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,337
It seems like he went there by himself last night

56
00:04:33,337 --> 00:04:36,737
to do a preliminary inspection of the filming site.

57
00:04:36,737 --> 00:04:39,237
Believing in his talent

58
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,037
and knowing his day would come,

59
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:44,437
Hiroko supported him all this time.

60
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:46,837
"Bar Sunflower"

61
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:48,737
Her long support during tough times

62
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:51,537
was just about to be rewarded,

63
00:04:51,537 --> 00:04:54,437
so, I feel so vexed.

64
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:01,437
Yes, this is Megure.

65
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:04,337
The old lady at the cigarette shop diagonal to the condo

66
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,737
seems to have been at the shop all day,

67
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:08,537
but didn't witness anybody going in or out of the condo

68
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:11,937
before or after the estimated time of death.

69
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,437
Only after that...

70
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:14,637
an employee from an electric appliance shop

71
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:16,837
carry a large cardboard box and went into the condo,

72
00:05:16,837 --> 00:05:19,237
but this was just a while ago

73
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:22,537
at about 4.30pm.

74
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:25,737
It doesn't seem to have anything to do with this case.

75
00:05:25,737 --> 00:05:27,937
Please continue asking around.

76
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:30,137
The one who sitting next to Mr. Takaoka?

77
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:31,337
His name is Mr. Shu Kizuka.

78
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:33,637
They are both co-workers at a part-time job.

79
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:35,537
He found the victim

80
00:05:35,537 --> 00:05:37,237
and called police.

81
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:40,837
Huh? You mean he's the one who found Ms. Hiroko

82
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:42,337
and not Mr. Takaoka?

83
00:05:42,337 --> 00:05:43,437
Yes.

84
00:05:43,437 --> 00:05:45,937
He wants to be a script writer.

85
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:47,437
"Shu Kizuka, age 35" -Since Mr. Takaoka told him

86
00:05:47,437 --> 00:05:49,537
that he wanted to borrow ideas for his story,

87
00:05:49,537 --> 00:05:52,637
they arranged to meet in this room at 5pm.

88
00:05:52,637 --> 00:05:55,237
He says the door wasn't locked.

89
00:05:56,237 --> 00:05:57,437
Hello.

90
00:05:57,437 --> 00:05:58,737
I'm Kizuka.

91
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:02,237
Hiroko, is Mr. Takaoka back?

92
00:06:05,037 --> 00:06:07,037
Hiroko...

93
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:11,837
We got his call and arrived here at 5.20pm.

94
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:14,637
Mr. Takaoka arrived home a little before that.

95
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:17,637
He seems to have been caught in a traffic jam on his way here

96
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:21,037
and arrived 15 minutes after the promised time.

97
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:24,537
Officer Takagi.

98
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:26,837
And Mr. Kizuka's alibi?

99
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:29,037
Yes, I've already confirmed it.

100
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:30,937
He was at his part time job

101
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:33,037
at a large electric appliance shop

102
00:06:33,037 --> 00:06:35,037
and from 11am to 1pm,

103
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:38,337
he was taking out merchandise from the warehouse.

104
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:40,037
Hey, Mr. Kizuka?

105
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:42,037
When you got here,

106
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:44,837
the front door wasn't locked, was it?

107
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,437
That... yeah, that's right.

108
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:51,237
Then, I wonder if Hiroko forgot to lock the door,

109
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:54,337
because when a woman are home alone,

110
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:56,337
wouldn't she normally lock the front door to be safe?

111
00:06:56,337 --> 00:06:59,137
She did often forget to lock the door.

112
00:06:59,137 --> 00:07:02,137
If only I had warned her more strongly,

113
00:07:02,137 --> 00:07:03,737
this wouldn't have had to happen.

114
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:05,637
"Weekly TV Parlor magazine"

115
00:07:08,937 --> 00:07:11,837
Only stand-up comedy shows are circled in red.

116
00:07:11,837 --> 00:07:14,137
I guess, not to forget?

117
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:16,937
I wonder if she liked to watch programs like these.

118
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,137
I wonder...

119
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,537
I guess so.

120
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:20,937
"Neta Battle SP. Big Laugh with Comedian in Studio"

121
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:25,937
It seems that she was planning to watch

122
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:27,937
from 3pm to 5pm today too.

123
00:07:27,937 --> 00:07:29,437
Sigh...

124
00:07:29,437 --> 00:07:32,537
She couldn't even watch her favorite program.

125
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:34,937
Is it just plain robbery?

126
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:37,437
No, something bothers me.

127
00:07:39,437 --> 00:07:40,537
Inspector!

128
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:42,937
Oh... how was it?

129
00:07:42,937 --> 00:07:45,637
Here. This...

130
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:47,637
What's this picture?

131
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:51,037
I was asking trying to get an alibi for Mr. Takaoka

132
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,237
around the time of the crime which was between 11am to 1pm.

133
00:07:54,237 --> 00:07:56,937
He was in Fukushima with the film crew, wasn't he?

134
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:59,137
Yes, he was at White Sand Beach.

135
00:07:59,137 --> 00:08:02,637
But, didn't seem to meet anyone there.

136
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:06,537
I see, you can't get proof of his alibi.

137
00:08:06,537 --> 00:08:10,837
Then he says he took money out at a nearby bank.

138
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:13,237
So, I confirmed with the White Sand Beach prefectural police

139
00:08:13,237 --> 00:08:16,337
and confirmed it in this picture.

140
00:08:18,437 --> 00:08:20,737
I'm on the monitor of the surveillance camera.

141
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:23,537
Yes, true.

142
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,237
I usually hate to be taken this way,

143
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:27,137
because I don't like being watched,

144
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:30,337
but just this time, I'm grateful to the surveillance camera.

145
00:08:30,337 --> 00:08:33,737
Mr. Takaoka, it's not that I suspect you,

146
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:36,637
but after went back to the hotel last night,

147
00:08:36,637 --> 00:08:38,337
did you meet anyone?

148
00:08:38,337 --> 00:08:39,937
No, I met no one.

149
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,837
You didn't see anyone?

150
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:44,037
"Hotel White Sand" -Oh, that's right.

151
00:08:44,037 --> 00:08:46,637
I order room service at night

152
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:49,437
a little after 12am.

153
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:54,737
Yes, let me explain what I did yesterday in order.

154
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,337
I usually use this

155
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,437
when making arrangements with the cameramen.

156
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:06,537
Could it just be a passing robbery?

157
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:08,837
Something's not right to conclude so.

158
00:09:08,837 --> 00:09:09,937
Sunflower...

159
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,037
I see.

160
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:18,737
This was what was bothering me.

161
00:09:18,737 --> 00:09:20,237
And...

162
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:21,837
An empty video case...

163
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:26,737
Yesterday at sundown, at 5pm,

164
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:29,337
I parted with Hiroko in front of the shop.

165
00:09:29,337 --> 00:09:30,737
Exactly.

166
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,137
It was the time I went to the shop so.

167
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:40,937
Conan, don't touch stuff here and there now.

168
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:42,337
Yes, sir.

169
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:45,937
This plug probably...

170
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:52,437
I was interviewed by a newspaper agency

171
00:09:52,437 --> 00:09:56,437
in Fukushima after 10pm.

172
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:58,537
This is the name card of the journalist

173
00:09:58,537 --> 00:10:00,337
and cameraman back then.

174
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,237
It's not how someone would take off their shoes.

175
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,837
Did the culprit kick it?

176
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:10,837
Or...

177
00:10:12,337 --> 00:10:13,737
What's this?

178
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:19,037
I checked out of the hotel the following morning after 8am.

179
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:20,037
This is...

180
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,737
The tab and receipt.

181
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:26,337
At 2.17am, you ordered curry.

182
00:10:26,337 --> 00:10:28,637
Mr. Takaoka's signature is on it too.

183
00:10:28,637 --> 00:10:30,737
-Yeah. -In other words...

184
00:10:30,737 --> 00:10:34,737
his alibi in the middle of the night is undoubtedly proven.

185
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:42,537
So that's the story, after all...

186
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:46,537
Then, I was taken by the surveillance camera of the bank after 12pm.

187
00:10:47,437 --> 00:10:51,437
In other words, Mr. Takaoka didn't leave Fukushima at all

188
00:10:51,437 --> 00:10:54,937
from last night till afternoon today.

189
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:56,037
No.

190
00:10:56,037 --> 00:10:57,537
Perfect.

191
00:10:57,537 --> 00:11:01,537
It's an alibi so perfect that not even an ant can get through it.

192
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:05,437
Oh, no, Conan!

193
00:11:05,437 --> 00:11:06,637
Don't touch!

194
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:08,337
Oh, I'm sorry.

195
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:09,537
But, it's all as well,

196
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:12,737
because I had forgotten what Pops told me to do.

197
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:14,637
He wants you to check this.

198
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:16,837
Check what?

199
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:19,537
The contents of Hiroko's bag and her shoes?

200
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:22,637
Yep. He said that it's important to conclude who the culprit is,

201
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:25,537
so to do it immediately.

202
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,150
Mr. Mouri, this is what you asked me to get.

203
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,850
Huh? I didn't...

204
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,550
Huh? But, Conan just told me...

205
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,050
Officer Takagi, where have you been?

206
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,650
Prepare an investigation team for me.

207
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,150
Check all the robberies there were in the past

208
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,750
and search for eye-witnesses.

209
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,250
Mr. Takaoka.

210
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,450
I understand how depressed you are,

211
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,550
but for Hiroko's sake too,

212
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,550
please make a splendid film

213
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,350
and get back on your feet again as soon as possible.

214
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,350
Mr. Mouri...

215
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,050
Inspector, thanks to Officer Takagi,

216
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,150
we have found many new facts.

217
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,250
New facts?

218
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,450
Yes.

219
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,750
By the way, Mr. Kizuka.

220
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,650
Will you please look inside the video deck, please?

221
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,950
Huh... okay.

222
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,450
There's a tape in there, isn't there?

223
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,850
-Yes. -Let's see what's recorded on it.

224
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,850
Please rewind it a little and play it.

225
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,350
"Bakuhatsu Konto"

226
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,850
Oh, this is a re-run.

227
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,750
I saw this program about a month ago.

228
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,950
What...

229
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,250
The leg of the chair that was knocked over caught on to the cord

230
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,650
and pulled the plug out of the outlet.

231
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,750
Hmm... most probably when Hiroko struggled with the culprit.

232
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,350
But, then why is the program that was recorded then still there?

233
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,750
The culprit didn't know that Hiroko was recording the program.

234
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,750
The video that was cut off is the 2-hour special

235
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,450
about 3/4ths through the program.

236
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,850
It started recording at 3pm and is cut off an hour and a half later.

237
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,150
Which means that the room was ransacked about 4.30pm

238
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,550
and not at the same time she was killed.

239
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,550
The culprit killed Hiroko a little afternoon,

240
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,950
then came back here again at sundown and ransacked the room.

241
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,950
It's not likely, is it?

242
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,650
The culprit killed Hiroko between 11am and 1pm at another place

243
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,150
and after bringing her body here,

244
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,950
ransacked the room

245
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,950
to make it look as if a robbery took place.

246
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,750
Officer Takagi, please show the inspector what you checked on.

247
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,750
Oh, yes.

248
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,250
Inspector, here it is.

249
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,250
Plain sand? Is what it looks like.

250
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,350
This is what was found on the insole of Hiroko's shoes.

251
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,350
What?

252
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,950
Forensics checked on it

253
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,750
and found that it's something called crying sand.

254
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,850
Crying sand?

255
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,250
Yes. It is composed of a lot of quartz

256
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,250
and is valuable sand that is found on unpolluted beaches.

257
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,350
There are 20 places with crying sand throughout the nation,

258
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,150
but one of them is White Sand Beach in Fukushima prefecture.

259
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,850
I would like to also add that it is the place

260
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,250
that Mr. Takaoka was yesterday on location.

261
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:34,050
Mr. Takaoka, I take it that you called Hiroko last night.

262
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,250
You probably told her something like,

263
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,450
why don't you come to Fukushima because I finished work.

264
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,950
"Hotel White Sand"

265
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:48,150
So, Hiroko recorded the program she wanted to watch

266
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,250
and headed for Fukushima early this morning.

267
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,750
You made plans to meet her after 12pm.

268
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,850
That's right after your image was taken

269
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,650
by the surveillance camera of the bank.

270
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,950
Hiroko arrived at the beach earlier than you.

271
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,250
After all, it's the beach that is the stage

272
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,150
for the movie her lover is going to be directing.

273
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,650
So, I'm sure she had special feelings dancing inside her.

274
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,750
But...

275
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,050
White Sand Beach is your hometown.

276
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,050
You knew when the place would be empty without people.

277
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,650
Right after that, you drove your car

278
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,050
and rushed over near here to this condo.

279
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,750
You parked your car in an inconspicuous place.

280
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,650
Under the disguise of a deliveryman of an electric appliance store,

281
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,650
you brought the cardboard box with Hiroko's dead body inside

282
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,650
up to this room.

283
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,150
In other words, the electric appliance shop deliveryman

284
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,650
that was witness after 4.30pm was...

285
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,050
Mr. Takaoka.

286
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,950
You disguised yourself using the clothes and cap of the place

287
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,950
where you work part-time for, didn't you?

288
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,250
Mr. Mouri, please stop.

289
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,050
I've been listening to you silently for a while,

290
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,850
but you're making me sound like I'm the one who killed her.

291
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,450
Huh...

292
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,550
"Check the car, from Mr. Mouri"

293
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,550
Excuse me.

294
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,450
Hey, Officer Takagi, where are you going?

295
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,250
It seems he just remembered something else

296
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,150
that I asked him to check for me.

297
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,150
Let me continue then.

298
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,450
After carrying Hiroko up here,

299
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,950
you in order to make this place look as if a robber had broken in,

300
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,050
struggled with her and killed her, messed the room up

301
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,050
and thought you successfully carried out your trick of deception.

302
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,950
Then, you got rid of the cardboard box, clothes and cap

303
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,650
that you used to disguise yourself somewhere.

304
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,950
Then finally told probably told Mr. Kizuka that you got caught in traffic

305
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,750
and deliberately appeared later than the time you promised.

306
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,650
Hiroko.

307
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,550
Hiroko!

308
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,250
This is the way you made it look as

309
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,450
if Hiroko was killed in this room

310
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,450
while you were in Fukushima at the time of the crime

311
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,850
and created a fake alibi.

312
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,350
Ridiculous.

313
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,650
Mr. Mouri, your deduction is based on the grounds

314
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,550
that Hiroko was called by me

315
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,550
and came to White Sand Beach

316
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,450
after which I killed her between 11am to 1pm.

317
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,950
You seem to be under the impression that's right.

318
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:27,650
But, do you have proof that Hiroko actually came to White Sand Beach?

319
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,950
I do.

320
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,150
Inspector, will you please look inside the envelope

321
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,050
that Officer Takagi brought a while ago?

322
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,750
This is...

323
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,850
"Director Debut in Hometown"

324
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,550
This is an article in Fukushima Nippo's morning paper today.

325
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,450
It was probably written at yesterday's interview.

326
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,450
That clipping was in the pocket of Hiroko's bag.

327
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,350
After arriving in Fukushima, Hiroko bought a newspaper

328
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,650
because she knew that you were interviewed yesterday.

329
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,350
Although it is a small article, it was about you.

330
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,850
For Hiroko, it was top news...

331
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,350
more important than any other news.

332
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,150
The support she gave you all this time everything was worthwhile.

333
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,650
The time when her efforts were to be rewarded has come.

334
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,650
I'm sure she put the precious article in her bag

335
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,450
with a dancing heart thinking the bud has finally bloomed.

336
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,450
A large sunflower has grown.

337
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,850
No, you're wrong. Hiroko never came!

338
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,250
I bought the newspaper.

339
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,550
And I cut it out and put it in her bag.

340
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,250
Mr. Takaoka.

341
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,050
Have you ever taken a good look

342
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,750
at the words written on the wall panel?

343
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,250
Watching only you.

344
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,050
It seems to be the feeling that the sunflower symbolizes.

345
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,950
It meant everything to Hiroko.

346
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,750
Mr. Takaoka, shouldn't you admit to your crime

347
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,350
and atone for the wrong you did?

348
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,050
That's absurd!

349
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,350
I didn't kill Hiroko!

350
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,450
Oh, Officer Takagi, how was it?

351
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,150
Yes, what?

352
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,750
Huh?

353
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,250
Inspector, please take a look.

354
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,550
I'm sending you the image.

355
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,150
It seems to be sand.

356
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,050
Yeah, white sand...

357
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,350
It's a lie.

358
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,250
There's no way something like that would be there.

359
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,550
Because I've made sure the blanket...

360
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,050
The blanket... what about it?

361
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,050
Shook all the sand off the blanket?

362
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:27,050
Although a very slight amount, there's some left under the blanket.

363
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:32,050
Mr. Takaoka, I'm sure that the sand is crying sand.

364
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,750
Will you please explain?

365
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,450
Why was crying sand found in the trunk of your car?

366
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,550
You're still talking like that?

367
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,350
You really want to end our relationship?

368
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,150
Just because a little luck seems to have turned your way,

369
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,650
don't say such things so easily.

370
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,650
I feel bad.

371
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,550
You've gotta be kidding.

372
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:56,350
How much do you think I devoted myself to you?

373
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:59,250
Next it's your turn to look after me.

374
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,250
You're spending your entire life paying me back.

375
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,050
I found a spare key inside Hiroko's bag,

376
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,450
so I borrowed it.

377
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:16,350
I found out that Hiroko intended to depend on me for life.

378
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,450
I didn't want her to swallow my whole life.

379
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,050
I wanted to protect my freedom.

380
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,850
However, Mr. Mouri,

381
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,250
your intuition sure is sharp.

382
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,350
You saw through my trick by a fluke.

383
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,650
Mr. Takaoka.

384
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,250
When you saw that potted sunflower knocked down on the floor,

385
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,550
didn't you feel something?

386
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,650
I don't know how it was in Fukushima,

387
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,250
but this town was clear and sunny

388
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,950
with not a cloud in sight.

389
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,350
What about it?

390
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,950
This room faces south.

391
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,150
Moroever, the curtain has been torn apart

392
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,650
and there is nothing to shut the light out.

393
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,550
If that potted plant was knocked over

394
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:01,250
between the estimated time of her death which was 11am to 1pm,

395
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,050
the sunflower would've been exposed to a lot of sunshine

396
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:08,550
until you found Hiroko at 5pm.

397
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:13,050
For the sunflower, sunshine is the energy to make it bloom.

398
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,150
Most naturally the flower...

399
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,950
However...

400
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,950
The flower is face down.

401
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,450
From all the facts so far,

402
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,750
we can deduce that the potted plant was knocked down at a later time.

403
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,350
That is, right before the dead body was found.

404
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,650
As a result of re-checking everything from that point of view.

405
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,650
I see, I understand.

406
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,550
But, Mr. Mouri, there is just one mistake.

407
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,850
It was when everything was completed and I was ready to leave.

408
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,550
That sunflower...

409
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,750
Maybe something made the soil inside become lopsided.

410
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,150
I didn't touch it at all.

411
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,650
"The Mouri Detective Agency" -Well, I guess he said so, but...

412
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,750
But, I think it was you.

413
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,350
You fell down from the stand to disclose the truth.

414
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,450
Right, Hiroko avenged her death.

415
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,250
Does Pops have a guest or something?

416
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,250
Hey, I really think so, but how about you?

417
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:52,450
He's talking seriously to the sunflower.

418
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,650
"Next Episode" -But, it's strange.

419
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,350
There are no other lights around,

420
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,250
so that house is probably the only house around.

421
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,750
Only one large house like that around here?

422
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,250
Who are you people and what are you doing there?

423
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,050
Who, and why at this hour of the night

424
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,650
with what type of sharp object did this to her?

425
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,050
The mountain crone's knife...

426
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,050
Don't tell me that...

427
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,450
Next Conan!

428
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,450
"The Knife of the Mountain Crone Part One"

429
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,850
Next Conan's Hint:

430
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,450
Kitchen Knife.

431
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,350
The next episode is a difficult case involving a mountain crone.

432
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,450
Yama's making an appearance.

433
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,250
Oh, that klutzy police detective.
