1
00:00:01,367 --> 00:00:04,367
Hey. Have you heard of urban legend?

2
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:08,667
Yes. A rumor that spreads gradually of occurrences

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:12,767
that seem possible, yet impossible.

4
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:14,167
I know!

5
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:15,567
Like "Kuchisakeonna" (woman with her mouth torn to her ears)

6
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:17,267
and "Jinmenken" (a dog with a human face), right?

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,967
Yeah. One of them is...

8
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:22,867
The dark tower.

9
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:25,567
It's a tower with no entrance or window. A mysterious tower.

10
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:29,167
Yeah! It's standing tall in the Kyodo Garden,

11
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:30,467
that pitch black one.

12
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:32,867
Keep your voice down.

13
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:36,167
Kyodo...

14
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:40,467
Come to think of it, she is Nanami Kyodo.

15
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:41,567
Yeah.

16
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:44,167
She's Ran's senior in the karate club called Kyodo.

17
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:48,367
They're making stuff like this.

18
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:49,767
A toy company?

19
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:51,467
A stationary store, right?

20
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:53,067
No, no.

21
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:57,167
This is a place where they make lens, mirrors and optical goods.

22
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:58,867
See.

23
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:07,467
Don't touch!

24
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,767
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:10,567
Don't worry about it.

26
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:14,767
I brought it because I thought Conan and the others would like it.

27
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,567
Thank you, Nanami.

28
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:19,767
It's beautiful!

29
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:20,967
Wow!

30
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:23,167
Let me see it, too!

31
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,867
It's really something!

32
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:26,167
It changes one after the other!

33
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:27,567
Hurry and change!

34
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:29,267
-Nanami. -Huh?

35
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:30,867
About what you said a while ago,

36
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:32,467
you seem to be in a tough situation.

37
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,567
There are a lot of treasure in the Kyodo residence!

38
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:37,867
-You thought so, didn't you? -Huh?

39
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:40,667
Yes... well...

40
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:44,567
Momoe came here too because she thought we were loaded.

41
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:46,667
It's the name my present mother.

42
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:51,167
Things between my father and her don't look good, though.

43
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:54,767
Did you think that the family of rich people are complex?

44
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:57,467
Unfortunately, we're running out of money too, though.

45
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:01,667
I sure wish that you at least find the treasure.

46
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:04,467
Momoe is convinced that there is some.

47
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:05,967
You mean, treasure?

48
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:07,967
Where is it?

49
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:12,067
Did you come to discuss where the treasure is?

50
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:16,067
No, she just came to let off steam.

51
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:18,867
I'm sorry!

52
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:22,767
That's exactly true, so what can I say?

53
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,967
But, I see...

54
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:31,667
Why not go on a treasure hunt while you're at it, you guys?

55
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:33,667
Okay!

56
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:34,967
Hey, Nanami.

57
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:37,067
If you say something like that and get them excited...

58
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:38,667
It's worth the try.

59
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:42,067
If by chance they happen to find it,

60
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:44,467
Mom can use it as alimony to split with Dad.

61
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:46,967
In other words, I'd be doing my parents a favor.

62
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,967
Oh no...

63
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:50,167
How about it, people?

64
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:52,267
Would you like to go on an adventure?

65
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:54,467
-Aye! -Aye!

66
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,467
The vivid colored memories of summer

67
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:00,467
solve mysteries all season round.

68
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:02,567
The dark tower that stands in the suburbs.

69
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:04,767
What is the secret behind no entrance no windows?

70
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,467
He sees through the one and only truth.

71
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:08,467
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

72
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:10,667
His name is Detective Conan!

73
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:56,794
"Secret Treasure of the Dark Tower (Part 1)"

74
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:02,522
It's almost like a park.

75
00:05:02,522 --> 00:05:04,722
Is this the whole yard?

76
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,922
Just as would be expected of the Kyodo residence.

77
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:09,522
That, isn't it?

78
00:05:10,922 --> 00:05:13,622
Yeah. It's the dark tower.

79
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,851
It doesn't have an entrance or any windows.

80
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:22,651
It's said that sometimes a mysterious laughter

81
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:24,651
is heard from the roof.

82
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:27,851
It's been 40 years already

83
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:30,051
since my grandfather, Seitaro Kyodo built it.

84
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:31,951
He must've been an engineer who liked to take things overboard.

85
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:34,951
I hear that he set up a lot of tricky gadgets in the mansion.

86
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:38,151
The dark tower is one of them, too.

87
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:41,451
Dad is planning to sell the tower, land and all.

88
00:05:41,451 --> 00:05:43,251
You mean the yard and all?

89
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:44,251
Yeah.

90
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:48,251
But, if so, the treasure hunt will go down the drain, right?

91
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:50,951
So, that's why you mother's getting flustered.

92
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,651
I don't want to!

93
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:54,751
I'm not selling the place off along with its treasure knowing about it!

94
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:57,151
This is no time to be saying selfish things!

95
00:05:57,151 --> 00:05:59,951
This is the last chance we have to rebuild the Kyodo family!

96
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:02,451
I can't be playing along with your dreams!

97
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:04,251
It's no dream.

98
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:07,451
Tsutomu remembers well, and yet...

99
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,251
It was a bit before grandfather died.

100
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:13,251
I can't be held responsible for such an old story.

101
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:17,451
But you did hear about the treasure, didn't you?

102
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:20,651
Well, yes, I did hear about it, if you put it that way.

103
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:23,251
See, even Tsutomu's saying so!

104
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:26,151
They've been that way for the longest time.

105
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:28,851
I'm sorry you had to see something unsightly like that.

106
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:31,351
I'm sure adults have their reasons.

107
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:35,951
Mom's always biting at Dad too, at home.

108
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:38,351
I'm the one being consoled.

109
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:40,651
Okay, why don't we go look at the tower first?

110
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,651
-Aye! -Aye!

111
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:46,751
It's quite tall, isn't it?

112
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:48,951
How's the roof?

113
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,251
There are no windows,

114
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:52,251
so I'll bet the inside is pitch dark.

115
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:55,151
I wonder why your grandfather made this?

116
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:57,351
It's the hiding place for the treasure!

117
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,551
It's most natural to think of it that way.

118
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:01,851
If so, there should be an entrance!

119
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:06,151
-Okay, let's go look for it! -Aye!

120
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:09,251
Haven't you heard about the treasure from you father?

121
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:10,751
Not at all.

122
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:13,151
Maybe because he was a son-in-law.

123
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,851
Maybe Mom who died heard about it.

124
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:17,851
And one more person Mr. Nagase may have heard about it.

125
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:19,951
What kind of person is he?

126
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:23,551
He was an engineer too and grandpa's assistant.

127
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:26,951
He's living in the annex of our house.

128
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:28,551
I don't know.

129
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:30,551
Just a hint would do.

130
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,051
Doesn't anything come to mind?

131
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:34,851
No matter how many times you ask me,

132
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:36,951
I know nothing of the treasure.

133
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:38,651
Is that all you want?

134
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:41,851
If so, if you will excuse me.

135
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:44,151
Mr. Nagase!

136
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:46,051
I'm sure he knows something.

137
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:49,051
He's not very friendly, but I don't think he would lie.

138
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,351
It's about time you forget about it.

139
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:53,151
If there's no treasure,

140
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:56,251
I can't get much alimony either, you know.

141
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:59,651
You don't mind me going to court to file our divorce, then, do you?

142
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:02,051
Momoe, you don't have to go that far.

143
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:04,351
I'll be going then.

144
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:07,651
Tsutomu.

145
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:12,151
Everybody's making fun of me.

146
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:16,551
I heard about the treasure in town.

147
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:18,151
Calm down.

148
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:20,751
There's no need to lend an ear to such rumors.

149
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,251
More than that...

150
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:29,451
Even if there's no entrance in the tower,

151
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:30,951
if you dig a tunnel through here,

152
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:32,651
you can get inside from the main house, can't you?

153
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:34,651
It would be a large construction.

154
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:36,851
Maybe grandpa would've done it.

155
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,251
For example...

156
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,851
See, the garden light over here?

157
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:44,251
Okay, look at the tower through the arch.

158
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:49,551
My eyes...

159
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:51,451
I... Something's happening to me.

160
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:53,151
Something's wrong?

161
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:55,751
A wall of lens is in between.

162
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:58,051
Good work, boy, exactly!

163
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:59,951
Huh? Since when?

164
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:07,651
This is also a prank that grandpa build.

165
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:08,751
I wouldn't be surprised

166
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:10,051
if there were an underground passage or something.

167
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:13,151
Nanami. You've got quite a party there.

168
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:17,051
Mom. She's my friend in high school, Ms. Ran Mouri.

169
00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:19,251
She's my ma, Momoe.

170
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:21,951
I keep telling you to speak more like a girl.

171
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:23,851
Thank you for being my daughter's friend.

172
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:27,151
I'm sorry we came here in large numbers.

173
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:29,351
You were talking to big brother, weren't you?

174
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:32,251
Did he recall anything that would be of use?

175
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:35,151
Something about a blue button,

176
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:37,551
but he doesn't understand what it means.

177
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:38,751
Who are they?

178
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:42,651
We're members of the Youth Detective Squad...

179
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:45,151
They say they'll help look for the treasure.

180
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,351
If so, they'll most welcome here, right, Ma?

181
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:50,151
Yes, yes. I'm counting on you.

182
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:51,551
See you then.

183
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:54,551
Kids like them can't possibly be of any use.

184
00:09:56,351 --> 00:09:58,551
She doesn't truest us, does she?

185
00:09:58,551 --> 00:10:01,251
-No. -What a strong perfume.

186
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:06,451
Besides, she was wearing really long fake nails.

187
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:13,551
How long does this connecting corridor extend?

188
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:16,251
It makes a 90 degree turn right there

189
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:18,451
and is connected to the storeroom of the annex.

190
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,351
Miso, soy sauce and sake used to be store there,

191
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:22,351
but now it's just a mere storeroom.

192
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,351
Nagase.

193
00:10:27,351 --> 00:10:28,951
What're you doing in the storeroom?

194
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:47,251
Treasure hunting sounds hard.

195
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:49,751
And did you find anything?

196
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:51,651
Yes. I think that if there's any treasure,

197
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,851
it would be in that tower.

198
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:56,151
A tower without an entrance or any windows

199
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:57,751
is too suspicious!

200
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:01,751
Absolutely, but there's no way in it, so it can't be helped.

201
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:04,251
What did they do when they were building it?

202
00:11:04,251 --> 00:11:07,151
You can't construct it without a way in or out, can you?

203
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:09,751
Yeah. That's true, but...

204
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:12,051
I'm sure we'll find it if we look for it!

205
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:15,251
So, that's their conclusion.

206
00:11:15,251 --> 00:11:18,251
So, will you please tell them what you know, Tsutomu?

207
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:19,951
Okay.

208
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:21,551
When I was seven years old,

209
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:24,551
I had a fever close to 104 degrees Fahrenheit because of a cold.

210
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,251
It was when Mom came to see me with Grandpa.

211
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:31,251
They were talking at my pillow side.

212
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:32,451
Taeko.

213
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:35,851
I'll tell just you about the story of my treasure.

214
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:39,951
By the time I realized it, they were both gone.

215
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:43,051
I got anxious and went looking for them.

216
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:55,151
I think I fainted while I was looking for them.

217
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:58,351
When I came to, Mom was taking care of me.

218
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:03,851
Tsutomu. Did you come after us?

219
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:07,451
So, you sniffed the smell of the treasure, eh?

220
00:12:09,951 --> 00:12:13,551
Is that all of what you remember?

221
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:17,151
No. There's something new that I recalled.

222
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:20,551
Grandpa pointed to a three-colored button and said...

223
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:23,651
"If you press that button, that's the treasure."

224
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:25,151
What color was the button?

225
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:27,551
The one that Grandpa pointed to was "blue."

226
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:31,451
Lightning?

227
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,251
Hold it. I recall one other thing!

228
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:37,851
When I went after Mom, I disappeared!

229
00:12:37,851 --> 00:12:40,651
That's right. There's no other way to put it.

230
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:43,551
-What do you mean? -Mean?

231
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:45,251
Well, that is...

232
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:47,351
I don't remember anything else.

233
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,951
But that should've been the entrance to the treasure!

234
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:52,651
And there's still more.

235
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:54,351
I was crying while walking along,

236
00:12:54,351 --> 00:12:57,251
then I got big, the minute I got small

237
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:59,551
and then I saw many split images of myself.

238
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:00,851
Stop!

239
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:04,351
You were just delirious because of you fever!

240
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,051
So, the treasure exits.

241
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:10,451
All we need to do now is to split up and look for it.

242
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:12,651
Will you help us too, Tsutomu?

243
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:15,151
Unfortunately, I'm not interested.

244
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:16,851
-What? -What?

245
00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:19,951
Getting vegetables ready

246
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:22,751
is more of an important hobby to me.

247
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:26,851
It's just like him.

248
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:28,151
The Kyodo Manufacturing Company

249
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:30,151
will go bankrupt in his generation.

250
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:32,051
No, it won't!

251
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:34,851
Because we'll find the treasure!

252
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:36,351
Yeah.

253
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,551
I'll be looking forward to it, young detectives!

254
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:43,151
-Yeah! -Yeah!

255
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:45,051
The tower's getting pretty close.

256
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:48,251
Huh? I don't see any tower.

257
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,451
No. That's ridiculous.

258
00:13:50,451 --> 00:13:54,451
Why? I can see the tower from this window!

259
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:57,951
I see. This is no ordinary glass.

260
00:13:57,951 --> 00:13:59,751
A 3-D picture is set into it.

261
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,651
Investigation starts!

262
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:07,651
The weather outside is different in every window!

263
00:14:07,651 --> 00:14:09,851
This window is sunny!

264
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:11,251
This is cloudy.

265
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,451
I wonder which the real weather is?

266
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:16,351
This is for real!

267
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:19,651
It's Mom's voice!

268
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:24,851
Mom! Mom!

269
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:26,651
Your brother...

270
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:28,551
Children, stay away!

271
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:32,851
Momoe! Momoe!

272
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:34,451
Get the ambulance, quick!

273
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:36,951
I already called for it!

274
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:38,651
What's going on?

275
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:44,051
It looks like she fell off the tower.

276
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,351
But this tower...

277
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:47,751
Doesn't have an entrance.

278
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:50,351
There's no way she could've made it up there!

279
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,212
"Police"

280
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:04,012
And it was show time for us.

281
00:15:04,012 --> 00:15:06,312
"Children, stay away" he says.

282
00:15:06,312 --> 00:15:09,212
We're unmistakably authorized personnel too and yet!

283
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:14,512
Is it an accident or a case?

284
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:17,212
Mouri, you sure catch on fast.

285
00:15:17,212 --> 00:15:18,912
Well, you see...

286
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:20,712
I was wondering what we're going to have for dinner.

287
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:24,112
And when I called Ran and this is what came up.

288
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:28,112
Did she fall off the tower despite not being able to get in?

289
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:30,912
No, I don't think so.

290
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:33,612
Maybe the corpse was put on the grass.

291
00:15:33,612 --> 00:15:36,012
We heard her scream, you know.

292
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:38,612
Maybe it was a recording?

293
00:15:38,612 --> 00:15:40,912
What? A recording?

294
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:43,412
A simple trick.

295
00:15:43,412 --> 00:15:45,812
Somebody hit her head in a different place

296
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,012
and carried her body over here.

297
00:15:48,012 --> 00:15:49,012
No matter who sees this,

298
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:51,712
they would think she fell off the tower.

299
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:55,712
But this dark tower has no entrance.

300
00:15:56,512 --> 00:15:59,512
In other words, the culprit would be would be narrowed down

301
00:15:59,512 --> 00:16:01,812
to somebody that didn't know that there is no entrance.

302
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:04,712
It's a beginner's concept as far as mysteries are concerned.

303
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:06,312
All the members of the Kyodo family know

304
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:08,912
that they cannot enter the tower, but...

305
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:12,412
Of course then the one who becomes suspicious

306
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:15,112
is somebody who's come here for the first time!

307
00:16:15,112 --> 00:16:16,312
For example...

308
00:16:16,312 --> 00:16:19,512
For example... Me?

309
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,012
Of course not!

310
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:23,612
But like Officer Takagi says,

311
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:26,012
the rumor's going around town too

312
00:16:26,012 --> 00:16:29,912
that there is treasure in the tower but it can't be entered!

313
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:32,712
-Right, that's it! -What?

314
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:34,212
The culprit carried the corpse over

315
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:36,712
to make it look like she fell off the tower.

316
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:39,812
If so, the police will thoroughly check the tower!

317
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:42,612
As a result, the treasure will be found!

318
00:16:42,612 --> 00:16:46,212
I see. Is that the reason the corpse was moved?

319
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:47,712
Which means that the culprit is...

320
00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:50,012
In other words, everyone in this Kyodo family

321
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:52,512
is to be suspected.

322
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,512
So we're back to scratch.

323
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:55,712
My God!

324
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:57,312
Inspector!

325
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:04,012
So the company as well as the family has problems.

326
00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:07,412
And everyone is capable of committing the crime.

327
00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:09,612
Everyone except for that young lady.

328
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:13,912
Only since the Father and the Son is not for the treasure,

329
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:17,412
so you deduction doesn't have grounds.

330
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,212
But there is one person who was sure that there would be treasure.

331
00:17:20,212 --> 00:17:21,612
Right?

332
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:24,212
I'm sure that, that person is the culprit!

333
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:27,812
Unfortunately, it's the victim.

334
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:31,712
Conan, what do you think?

335
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:34,012
Do you think she died of an accident?

336
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,112
I'm sure we've got a case!

337
00:17:36,112 --> 00:17:39,212
Unfortunately, we can't be sure yet.

338
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:41,912
We met her in the yard.

339
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:44,912
There wasn't enough time to move the body.

340
00:17:44,912 --> 00:17:46,712
True.

341
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:50,512
It's most natural to thin that she fell off the tower.

342
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:53,712
Which means that the victim found the entrance

343
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:56,612
right after she met us?

344
00:17:56,612 --> 00:17:58,312
Maybe it's this way.

345
00:17:58,312 --> 00:17:59,912
She was lured into the tower

346
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,712
by the culprit who was knowledgeable about it,

347
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:03,312
and was pushed off!

348
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:08,712
Maybe the culprit is still hiding in the tower.

349
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,012
But we've got to find the entrance.

350
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:13,312
Exactly.

351
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:15,012
Even if we find the entrance,

352
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,512
we don't need to go inside.

353
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:20,512
The lady was walking near the garden light, wasn't she?

354
00:18:20,512 --> 00:18:23,312
If there was an entrance, it has to be in this direction.

355
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:25,012
Do you have any clue?

356
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:27,912
The old man called Seitaro was an engineer.

357
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:30,412
I think he hid it with things

358
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:32,112
like the glass and lens that we just saw.

359
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,612
-Huh? -What's the matter?

360
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:37,412
This looks suspicious!

361
00:18:37,412 --> 00:18:40,912
I disappeared... or so I thought...

362
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,312
This trace...

363
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:44,212
Is it a door?

364
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:46,712
I found it! The secret entrance!

365
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:48,412
All right.

366
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:53,812
Looks impossible, it's rusty.

367
00:18:55,712 --> 00:18:57,212
If she went in,

368
00:18:57,212 --> 00:18:59,312
she would've gone through a plain normal entrance.

369
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:01,212
-I guess so. -Right.

370
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:03,312
Let's try somewhere else.

371
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:06,612
Become a giant, become a dwarf.

372
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,812
Many splits of myself.

373
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:10,912
Disappear...

374
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:13,712
How beautiful!

375
00:19:16,212 --> 00:19:18,312
Amazing!

376
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:21,012
The entire floor is like a planetarium!

377
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:23,912
Who knows what will happen.

378
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,012
Stay together, okay?

379
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:28,612
Hey, Ayumi!

380
00:19:28,612 --> 00:19:30,312
You shouldn't go off alone.

381
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:32,512
But...

382
00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:34,212
-Let's go together. -Yep.

383
00:19:34,212 --> 00:19:36,312
Ai, too?

384
00:19:36,312 --> 00:19:38,812
This is the ladies room.

385
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:40,212
I see.

386
00:19:44,812 --> 00:19:46,812
I'll catch up with you right away, so go on ahead.

387
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:48,412
Yep.

388
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:53,012
Disappear?

389
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:55,512
It can't be.

390
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:57,712
Wind?

391
00:19:57,712 --> 00:19:59,812
Maybe...

392
00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:09,712
Ai, are you still in there?

393
00:20:09,712 --> 00:20:11,512
Ai's gone!

394
00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:12,612
What?

395
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:15,112
Hey, Ai!

396
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:18,512
-Ai! -Ai!

397
00:20:19,712 --> 00:20:21,712
There's wind coming from the space.

398
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:25,412
Ai!

399
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:29,912
Gosh. There's got be an entrance elsewhere!

400
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:32,312
Next door is the liquor storeroom.

401
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:34,512
Okay, let's search there!

402
00:20:35,912 --> 00:20:37,212
It smells of liquor!

403
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:40,012
I'm used it because of Dad!

404
00:20:40,012 --> 00:20:41,812
There's a mirror!

405
00:20:41,812 --> 00:20:44,512
Why would it be left standing in a place like this?

406
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:46,712
Standing it there is just sham.

407
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,712
It's on very tightly.

408
00:20:48,712 --> 00:20:51,612
This is probably the entrance that she went through.

409
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:55,912
I disappeared. There's no other way to put it.

410
00:20:55,912 --> 00:20:58,112
How would he disappear?

411
00:20:58,112 --> 00:21:00,712
There's a mirror here, too.

412
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:03,012
This smell...

413
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,612
If you sniff it too much, you'll really get drunk.

414
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:08,812
No, I smell the lady's perfume.

415
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:11,912
Her smell is all over this area.

416
00:21:13,712 --> 00:21:14,912
What's up?

417
00:21:14,912 --> 00:21:16,412
Disappeared!

418
00:21:16,412 --> 00:21:19,612
The ceiling is reflected in the mirror but we're not?

419
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:23,212
It switched to a screen!

420
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:26,012
A picture's being taken from there!

421
00:21:26,012 --> 00:21:27,312
Rubber tape?

422
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:28,812
A person can go under it!

423
00:21:28,812 --> 00:21:31,012
It's the entrance to the treasure! Let's go!

424
00:21:31,012 --> 00:21:33,312
We'll be in trouble if the culprit is there!

425
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:38,012
Hey!

426
00:21:38,012 --> 00:21:39,412
What shall we do?

427
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:42,412
What shall we do, Conan?

428
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,512
Ai?

429
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,812
Ai!

430
00:21:54,812 --> 00:21:57,012
It's not like her to scream like that.

431
00:21:57,012 --> 00:21:58,312
I'll be right over!

432
00:21:58,312 --> 00:22:00,312
Stay here, Ayumi!

433
00:22:00,312 --> 00:22:03,512
-No. I'm going to rescue her! -Don't!

434
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:12,112
Okay, let's go!

435
00:22:12,112 --> 00:22:14,012
Don't ever let go of my hand.

436
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:15,912
Okay!

437
00:23:53,412 --> 00:23:55,912
"Next Episode" -The kid's are gone?

438
00:23:55,912 --> 00:23:57,712
Let's go look for them one more time.

439
00:23:57,712 --> 00:24:01,012
Maybe Mr. Nagase knows something I don't.

440
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:02,812
Mr. Nagase...

441
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:04,512
Mr. Nagase disappeared!

442
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:10,012
Everybody's not going to be found just by making a fuss.

443
00:24:10,012 --> 00:24:12,012
More than that's let's think...

444
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:15,512
This is...

445
00:24:15,512 --> 00:24:17,812
Conan.

446
00:24:17,812 --> 00:24:19,212
Next Conan,

447
00:24:19,212 --> 00:24:23,312
"Secret Treasure of the Dark Tower (Part 2)"
