1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:08,585
Haruyama Junpei (37) Café Manager

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,069
The victim is Haruyama Junpei-san, 37 years old,

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,740
who operates a café by the train station.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,000
He was killed last night around 9 PM.

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,610
We believe he was attacked after closing his shop and heading towards his home past this area.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,379
At any rate, he was stabbed repeatedly.

7
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,070
It's safe to assume the suspect's motive is a grudge.

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,770
All right.

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,950
Gather information from the locals and—

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,609
Uh...

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,500
Is something the matter?

12
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:46,770
Nothing. I just thought he might show up.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,279
In any case, gather information and draw up a list of his acquaintances.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,030
Yes, sir.

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,269
A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step!

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,529
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,459
Curtains rise on a man's quest for revenge.

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,330
Follow that suspect! Where is he now?

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,139
Always determining the one truth

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,999
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,570
his name is Detective Conan!

22
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,310
"Out For Revenge, Part One!"

23
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,670
It's on the fifth floor of this building.

24
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,410
Inspector!

25
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,420
I knew he'd show up.

26
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,239
Are you here on a case?

27
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,559
You're gathering information for that case that was on the news, right?

28
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,180
Yeah...

29
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,930
One of the victim's friends is inside this building.

30
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,649
I see.

31
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,100
Then allow me to assist you.

32
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,200
Me, too!

33
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,870
You must be Natsukawa Yoji-san, the investment consultant.

34
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,319
Yes, that's me.

35
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,000
What business do the police have with me?

36
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,989
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

37
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,910
Would that be all right?

38
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,030
Come in.

39
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,770
You have guests.

40
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,620
Don't mind them.

41
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:15,900
Well?

42
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,520
What did you want to ask me?

43
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,570
You've probably already seen it on the news,

44
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,070
but your friend Haruyama Junpei-san was found murdered this morning.

45
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,469
Huh?

46
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,710
Looks like your guests knew Haruyama-san, too.

47
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,630
Excuse me, but who are you two?

48
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,379
We've got nothing to do with this.

49
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,800
I was just thinking about how I'd heard that story on the news.

50
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,220
For reference, could we get your names?

51
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,119
My name is Fuyuki Ryuzaburo.

52
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,609
I make a meager living in finance.

53
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,109
I'm Akiba Miyako.

54
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,740
I work in real estate.

55
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,349
Neither of them are on our list of acquaintances.

56
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,490
Well?

57
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,910
What did you want to ask?

58
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,390
Do you know anyone who may have held a grudge against the late Haruyama-san?

59
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,779
There wasn't anyone like that.

60
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,670
What about you two?

61
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,919
Who knows?

62
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,180
I don't know anyone named Haruyama.

63
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,050
You guys...

64
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,930
Even if I knew Haruyama,

65
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,610
the murder happened last night, right?

66
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,190
If you investigate my whereabouts at that time, you'll find that I have an alibi.

67
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,159
I have nothing to do with the case.

68
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,320
Likewise.

69
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,680
It would be wise to take your investigation elsewhere.

70
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,830
Those three are hiding something.

71
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,330
Most likely.

72
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,120
But why hide what they know?

73
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,590
They're either protecting the culprit

74
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,620
or there's some reason why they can't tell us.

75
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,810
The Next Day

76
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,100
All right.

77
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,479
I'll get the truth out of him for the inspector.

78
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,200
He did throw up a smokescreen yesterday.

79
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,609
This place is both a residence and office, right?

80
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,360
Yeah.

81
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:38,620
Did he go out this morning?

82
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,710
It's unlocked.

83
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,790
Natsukawa-san!

84
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,720
Natsukawa-san, are you all right?

85
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,720
Damn.

86
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,100
Kid, call the inspector.

87
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,340
Got it!

88
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,229
As we told you earlier, last night,

89
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,950
Natsukawa Yoji-san was murdered as well.

90
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,620
He was killed in the same manner as Haruyama-san.

91
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,459
Fuyuki-san and Akiba-san,

92
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,880
you know why we asked you to come here, don't you?

93
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:34,010
You're going to tell us everything you've been hiding.

94
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,229
Damn.

95
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,390
It wasn't a groundless fear after all.

96
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:46,640
If both Haruyama and Natsukawa have been killed, then it must be him.

97
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,030
Him, who?

98
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,520
Komoto.

99
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,030
Komoto Takashi.

100
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,410
Who is this Komoto?

101
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:08,189
Haruyama, Natsukawa, and the two of us got to know each other as regulars at a bar.

102
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,960
That was ten years ago.

103
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,665
(10 Years Ago)

104
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,480
The four of us had dreams and ambitions, but we lacked the cash.

105
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,620
We told each other that if only we had the capital, we'd manage somehow.

106
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,920
That's when Fuyuki made a suggestion.

107
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,900
"I have a high school classmate named Komoto Takashi."

108
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,979
"He inherited a huge amount of money from his parents."

109
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,030
"Let's swindle him out of his money."

110
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,690
"He's a naïve rich boy. I guarantee it'll work."

111
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,040
We presented him with a bogus investment opportunity

112
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,050
and split the money we swindled.

113
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:55,550
We even hired a lawyer to cover up our fraud.

114
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,500
He must have lost hope after being betrayed by a former classmate.

115
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,670
He left Japan and moved to South America.

116
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,540
I see.

117
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,820
In other words, the four of you

118
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,700
ganged up on Komoto and preyed upon him.

119
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,950
Th-That was ten years ago.

120
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,000
B-But the other day,

121
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,210
we received a frightened call from Haruyama.

122
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,719
He said Komoto was peering into his shop.

123
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,880
He thought he may have returned to Japan to get revenge.

124
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,299
But the three of us laughed it off,

125
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,660
saying it must've been someone else and that he was imagining it.

126
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,980
But then we saw on the news that Haruyama had been murdered.

127
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,460
We thought it might actually be Komoto.

128
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,110
So the three of you gathered because you were worried.

129
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,059
They must've been right in the middle of that.

130
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,370
That's when we visited Natsukawa with the police.

131
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,379
And now that Natsukawa has been murdered as well...

132
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,630
Komoto's the only guy who resented Haruyama and Natsukawa.

133
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,549
Confirm their story ASAP.

134
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,420
Yes, sir.

135
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,890
We'll be asking you for more details down at the station.

136
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,475
(MPD Beika Police Station)

137
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:31,400
According to the Immigration Bureau, one week ago, Komoto Takashi returned to Japan.

138
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,190
I knew it.

139
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,859
He's already checked out, but we also found the hotel where he was staying.

140
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,200
We were able to collect Komoto's fingerprints from the belongings he left behind.

141
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,200
And?

142
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:51,910
They matched the fingerprints collected from the scenes of both Haruyama's and Natsukawa's murders.

143
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,500
So Komoto is the murderer, then.

144
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,420
We also found this.

145
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,680
This is an image of Komoto Takashi captured by the hotel's security cameras.

146
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,839
This is what he looks like now?

147
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,430
His hair is snow white.

148
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,310
Also, Komoto apparently said to an employee

149
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,440
that he has an incurable illness and doesn't have long to live.

150
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,329
I see.

151
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,649
With death approaching,

152
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,859
Komoto returned to Japan and murdered Haruyama and Natsukawa,

153
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,710
the men who betrayed him, one after another.

154
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,090
What's wrong with him?

155
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,110
He must be crazy.

156
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,590
Why get revenge now for something that happened ten years ago?

157
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,699
I was curious about that,

158
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,190
so I asked the local police about it.

159
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,469
Regardless of his motive,

160
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,980
we can't allow him to kill anyone else.

161
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,559
You'll act as their bodyguards and do whatever it takes to find Komoto Takashi.

162
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,270
Yes, sir!

163
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,239
It's a brutal serial murder case,

164
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,530
but there's nothing left for me to do.

165
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,120
Yeah, seems that way.

166
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,130
The Next Day

167
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,180
Shikigawa Valley

168
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,560
(The Uedas)

169
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,539
See? It's a little scary, isn't it?

170
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,549
But the view is incredible.

171
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,280
It certainly is!

172
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,129
I know I shouldn't be out walking around,

173
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,249
but my client wanted to meet outdoors.

174
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,860
It can't be helped.

175
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,670
I need to check out the area beforehand.

176
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,910
I didn't say anything.

177
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,390
Now this is a view.

178
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,669
Akiba-san, I'm going to go check out that noise.

179
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,960
Stay there!

180
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,350
Akiba...

181
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,180
K-Komoto...

182
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,050
It's all...

183
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,810
It's all your guys' fault!

184
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,480
Crap!

185
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,820
Die!

186
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,250
Akiba-san! What happened?

187
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,500
K-Komoto just fell.

188
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,800
What? Komoto fell?

189
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:45,089
There's no way he survived a fall from that height.

190
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:45,880
Yeah.

191
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,530
You're saying this is what happened.

192
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,759
You were lured away by a noise in the thicket.

193
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,539
While you were looking elsewhere,

194
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:01,339
Komoto attacked Akiba-san, and after a struggle, Komoto's foot slipped and he fell.

195
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,780
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,170
You didn't see the moment Komoto fell?

197
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,530
No.

198
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,619
What? Are you trying to say I pushed him?

199
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,919
No, I didn't say that.

200
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,350
It's true.

201
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,789
She's telling the truth.

202
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,510
That man accidentally fell by himself.

203
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,789
We saw it, too.

204
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,320
Yeah.

205
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,320
See?

206
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,489
That person must've seen it, too.

207
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,470
Huh?

208
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:36,830
They're not here anymore.

209
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,580
Looks like there's several witnesses.

210
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:45,590
Yeah. In other words, Komoto Takashi accidentally fell to his death.

211
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,519
Looks that way.

212
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,460
But where is the body?

213
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,720
Is it possible that he survived and fled?

214
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,659
It did take us a while to get down here.

215
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,629
You're saying he disappeared during that time?

216
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,419
It's not impossible.

217
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,360
But a fall from this height?

218
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,650
Detective Takagi, how did Komoto get here?

219
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,650
There's a rental car that Komoto seems to have driven here.

220
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:22,799
Then if he survived, even if he was injured,

221
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,290
wouldn't he have used that car to flee?

222
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,800
Maybe he was so badly injured that he couldn't drive a car.

223
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,050
What?

224
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,439
In any case, I'll check out the hospitals in the area.

225
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,600
Good idea.

226
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,679
What a waste of time.

227
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,190
There's no way he survived a fall from there.

228
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,440
Anyway, I can go now, right?

229
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,929
That should be fine. Chiba.

230
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,730
Yes, sir.

231
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,440
What?

232
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,719
I don't need a bodyguard anymore, do I?

233
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,610
He's dead now.

234
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,379
It's just to be safe.

235
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,120
He'll escort you home.

236
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,560
Let's go.

237
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,910
Now that the suspect is dead, the case is closed.

238
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,760
It's not what I would've wanted, though.

239
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,539
I know what Takagi said,

240
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,870
but it's hard to believe he survived a fall from up there.

241
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,760
Right.

242
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,280
But why haven't they found a body?

243
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,520
It doesn't look that deep.

244
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,630
It wouldn't be odd if the body got caught on the rocks at the bottom of the cliff.

245
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,450
(Shikigawa General Hospital)

246
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,289
I see.

247
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,830
No injured patients matching that description have arrived.

248
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,950
Thank you.

249
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,800
Are you a police detective?

250
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:46,819
Yes?

251
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,889
If you're looking for him, then is he the suspect in a case or something?

252
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,840
Yes.

253
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,560
In that case, I hope you find him soon.

254
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,589
It would be terrible if he did anything.

255
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,700
Yes...

256
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,270
Hello, Inspector Megure?

257
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,160
I didn't find anything. Komoto hasn't shown up at the hospital.

258
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,550
Komoto destroyed himself, then.

259
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:24,200
He fell headfirst and screamed all the way down to hell.

260
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,199
In other words, you and I survived.

261
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,090
We have the devil's luck.

262
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,560
2 Days Later

263
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,899
Stabbed repeatedly with a knife.

264
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,570
Same method.

265
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,630
T.K.?

266
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,460
Komoto Takashi.

267
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,619
Akiba-san was murdered last night around 11 PM.

268
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:22,840
Komoto Takashi's fingerprints were found on the lighter left next to the body.

269
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,609
So Komoto survived his fall from that cliff.

270
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,350
And he has resumed his revenge murders.

271
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,270
Inspector Megure.

272
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,080
I've learned why Komoto sought revenge now.

273
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,419
When he first moved to South America,

274
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,580
Komoto Takashi sometimes lost consciousness.

275
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,529
It was a psychological condition caused by an extreme distrust of others

276
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,960
and posed no threat to his life.

277
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,210
It must've been caused by the betrayal of those four.

278
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,329
Since it hadn't happened during the past several years,

279
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,840
he believed he had recovered from his condition.

280
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,279
But one month ago,

281
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,059
Komoto was told by his doctor that he didn't have much time left to live,

282
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,459
so he left on a trip with his beloved wife

283
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,519
to make his final days the happiest they could be.

284
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,339
However, his condition caused a tragedy on their journey.

285
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,039
They got into an accident while on their trip.

286
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,749
While Komoto was attempting to call an ambulance for his badly injured wife,

287
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,019
he lost consciousness due to his condition,

288
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,930
and his wife passed away.

289
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:42,470
He was still suffering the effects of their betrayal ten years later.

290
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,739
And if that took the life of his beloved wife,

291
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,470
I can understand why he sought revenge.

292
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,800
Damn it.

293
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,230
He blamed us for the death of his wife, too?

294
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,850
Save me.

295
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:57,920
Please!

296
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,490
(Incoming Call From Number-Withheld Public Telephone)

297
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,880
Hello?

298
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,660
It's Komoto.

299
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,740
K-Komoto?

300
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,750
You're the last one left, Fuyuki.

301
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,520
You'll pay for deceiving me ten years ago.

302
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,109
Spare me, Komoto!

303
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,689
I was wrong. I'll return your money.

304
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,459
I'll return ten times what we took, okay?

305
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,360
Money, money, money.

306
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,820
You think you can erase your sins with money.

307
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,900
No wonder you think you can buy your own life with money, too.

308
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,920
You're the same scumbag you ever were.

309
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,800
K-Komoto?

310
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,429
Komoto, hello? Komoto!

311
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,490
Spare me, Komoto!

312
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,109
Find him.

313
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,490
Do whatever it takes to find Komoto.

314
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,490
Yes, sir.

315
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,870
So his revenge wasn't over yet.

316
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,140
Yeah, but why did he bother to call him this time?

317
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,880
Because he's the one he hated the most.

318
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,110
He's the one who suggested they swindle him.

319
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,340
That's true, but...

320
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,310
Something's not right.

321
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,780
There's only one conceivable explanation.

322
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,030
He's got something wrapped around his stomach.

323
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,280
That's Mr. X?

324
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,809
He wouldn't bother retrieving a dead body

325
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,330
or burying one in the mountains unless he was really determined.

326
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,719
Retrieve a dead body?

327
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,650
Wait a minute.

328
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,840
What if he had still been alive then?

329
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,550
That would mean...

330
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,300
The next episode of Conan is "Out For Revenge, Part Two!"
