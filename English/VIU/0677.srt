1
00:00:00,805 --> 00:00:04,205
"Oohama Beach" -A two hours car ride from Beika-cho.

2
00:00:04,453 --> 00:00:07,553
We've come here to Oohama Beach.

3
00:00:07,553 --> 00:00:11,553
Pops suddenly says he wants to go surfing.

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,853
Thinking that refusing would be a hassle,

5
00:00:14,853 --> 00:00:16,953
Ran and I go along unwillingly.

6
00:00:16,953 --> 00:00:19,153
Grab your wet suit firmly

7
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:21,653
and shove your feet through it.

8
00:00:23,753 --> 00:00:25,453
Tight!

9
00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:28,353
Yes. If it's loose,

10
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:30,253
water will come in, you see.

11
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:38,053
This all started because Pops was

12
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:40,353
"Nagisa Imaoka (25)" -invited to come over by this woman

13
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:42,853
that he had recently met.

14
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:45,153
Exert strength, more!

15
00:00:48,453 --> 00:00:51,053
In order not to lose your surfboard,

16
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:53,853
use this leash cord and connect it to your ankle.

17
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,453
Make sure the length is a little longer than your surfboard.

18
00:00:56,453 --> 00:00:58,853
Approximately two meters for an adult,

19
00:00:58,853 --> 00:01:01,653
and 1.5 meters for a child.

20
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:03,453
Doesn't it ever gets severed?

21
00:01:03,453 --> 00:01:05,553
Rarely.

22
00:01:05,553 --> 00:01:08,553
But you can never tell what will happen

23
00:01:08,553 --> 00:01:10,553
if you are taken in by a big wave that comes along.

24
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:13,653
That's one of the interesting things about surfing.

25
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:17,053
Then, shall we go ride the waves?

26
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,253
The vivid colored memories of summer.

27
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:56,353
Solve mysteries all season round.

28
00:01:56,353 --> 00:01:58,153
Along the vast sandy beach,

29
00:01:58,153 --> 00:02:00,553
a figure of a person lies, with no footprints around.

30
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,253
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:04,253
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:06,653
His name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:46,745 --> 00:03:49,545
"A Sandy Beach Without Footprints".

34
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:02,145
Are you Mr. Mouri?

35
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:03,645
I'm sorry,

36
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:04,845
I've been out doing some purchasing,

37
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,845
so I wasn't here to introduce myself.

38
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:11,445
I heard from Nagisa that the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri would be here,

39
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:13,345
"Umishiro Imaoka (60)" -and was looking forward to meeting you.

40
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:15,745
I am Umishiro Imaoka.

41
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:17,445
How do you do?

42
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:20,645
Well, this is my first experience at surfing,

43
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:22,245
but it sure is a lot of fun.

44
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:25,845
I'm the type of guy that likes to go along with the flow.

45
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:27,245
So, likewise, with surfing.

46
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:29,845
You're the type who gets carried away.

47
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:31,645
I feel that I'm wasting my time being here like this.

48
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:34,545
I'm dying to ride the waves.

49
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:40,945
Sir, is this a calendar of the spring tide?

50
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:43,045
Yes, it is, Sonny.

51
00:04:43,045 --> 00:04:44,645
Looking at this...

52
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:46,545
Tonight's going to be the night of the spring tide, right?

53
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:49,445
Yeah. Oohama Beach here

54
00:04:49,445 --> 00:04:53,345
is famous for the great gap during high tide and low tide.

55
00:04:53,345 --> 00:04:57,345
During high tide late at night... Let's see.

56
00:04:57,345 --> 00:05:01,845
The shore becomes about 100 meters closer.

57
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:03,445
But, in the morning,

58
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:06,645
the tides withdraw as if fleeing

59
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:09,645
and a shallow water beach that seems to have been washed by the waters,

60
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:13,345
spread over a distance of about one kilometer.

61
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:14,445
It's fun getting up early

62
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:17,545
and making footprints in the sand too.

63
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:20,245
I understand.

64
00:05:20,245 --> 00:05:22,045
For example, if you get to do this in the snow

65
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:25,245
where no one else has passed...

66
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:26,945
Dad!

67
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,045
Are these trophies yours?

68
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:32,745
Yes, they are.

69
00:05:32,745 --> 00:05:34,145
In the world of amateurs,

70
00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:36,745
she was a pretty good surfer.

71
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:38,245
No wonder.

72
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:41,945
Well, how lucky of you to have such a wonderful daughter.

73
00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:45,645
Well, how embarrassing of me.

74
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,845
The fact is, she's not my daughter.

75
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:50,945
Dont tell me that...

76
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:52,945
he's your son? A boy?

77
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:54,845
No, no. Was married.

78
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:57,245
She's my wife.

79
00:05:57,245 --> 00:05:59,145
Wife?

80
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:01,545
Which means that she's married?

81
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:04,245
We have an age difference of 35 years.

82
00:06:09,345 --> 00:06:11,645
Don't let that get you down, Pops.

83
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:15,645
Dad, come on. Let's continue surfing.

84
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:17,245
Right, Conan?

85
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:18,245
Yup!

86
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:23,045
I've had enough. I'm kind of tired.

87
00:06:23,045 --> 00:06:26,245
Right, I see, you're his wife.

88
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:30,445
Nagisa, I'm ready.

89
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:32,745
Okay! Let's go then.

90
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:34,045
Don't!

91
00:06:36,945 --> 00:06:39,845
According to the weather forecast I heard in the car,

92
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:42,245
low atmospheric pressure seems to be closing in.

93
00:06:42,245 --> 00:06:43,845
Look at the waves.

94
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:46,045
The tip of the waves is turning white.

95
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:52,645
I've heard that surfing is more enjoyable

96
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,345
when the waves are a bit high.

97
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:57,145
There are people who say that,

98
00:06:57,145 --> 00:06:59,145
but I'm against it.

99
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:01,845
Especially because you're beginners, aren't you?

100
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:04,345
There are many people who are taken away by the high tides

101
00:07:04,345 --> 00:07:05,845
and lose their lives, you know.

102
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:08,045
You should never take the sea lightly.

103
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:12,245
You can't enjoy surfing talking chicken like that!

104
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:14,645
I'm with you, so you'll be fine.

105
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:16,945
Don't get conceited!

106
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:20,245
What the hell can you do, against the high tides?

107
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:22,145
Enough of your conceit!

108
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:34,145
Oh, no. I'm sorry I raised my voice.

109
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:36,545
No, no, it's okay.

110
00:07:36,545 --> 00:07:38,645
I'm sure that the low atmospheric pressure will pass by morning.

111
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:40,745
Wait until then.

112
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:51,145
Really. Don't you have any challenge spirit at all?

113
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:55,145
You're an old man who only finds pleasure in making plastic models.

114
00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:56,945
You're such a bore.

115
00:07:56,945 --> 00:08:01,345
I can hear the sea calling, challenge me.

116
00:08:01,345 --> 00:08:02,845
This is where the passion burns,

117
00:08:02,845 --> 00:08:05,545
the blood of a surfer girl boils!

118
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:06,945
Do you understand?

119
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,445
Well...

120
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:12,545
I understand the relationship between you two very well.

121
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:14,345
If we can't surf,

122
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:16,445
we may as well return to the pension.

123
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:17,845
Right?

124
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:19,245
I guess so.

125
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:35,145
Left, left.

126
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:37,845
No, no, to the right.

127
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:39,745
Right there.

128
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:42,845
Nagisa used to be a customer of that shop?

129
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:44,145
Yeah.

130
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:45,945
According to the pension owner,

131
00:08:45,945 --> 00:08:47,845
something about she's going to conquer the waves here.

132
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:50,645
That's why it seems she's been frequenting coming here.

133
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:55,045
And three years ago, she was conquered instead.

134
00:08:57,345 --> 00:08:58,645
Yes, please come in.

135
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:01,245
Excuse me.

136
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:03,545
Mr. Imaoka. What seems to be the matter?

137
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,345
Huh? Your wife's not around?

138
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:09,545
No.

139
00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:12,645
I was making preparations in the kitchen for tomorrow,

140
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:14,745
when she disappeared from sight.

141
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:18,745
So I was wondering if she was over here visiting you.

142
00:09:18,745 --> 00:09:20,945
No, she's not here.

143
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:22,445
Don't tell me she went to the sea...

144
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:24,245
Where's your wife's surfboard?

145
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:25,645
At the shop.

146
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:29,645
Could she has taken a surfboard from the shop?

147
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:31,045
She most probably would.

148
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:33,145
When she sees the rough sea on a day like this,

149
00:09:33,145 --> 00:09:34,945
her eyes get sharp.

150
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:37,945
It's almost like a shark going after prey.

151
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:41,345
Sir, something is flashing in your chest pocket.

152
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:43,245
Maybe something's coming in on your cell phone?

153
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,245
It's from my wife.

154
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:50,745
"I'm sorry, I went off without telling you.

155
00:09:50,745 --> 00:09:54,045
Karaoke now. I'm may stay out all night."

156
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:55,645
I didn't notice this.

157
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:58,445
I'm glad she didn't go out to sea.

158
00:09:58,445 --> 00:09:59,745
Even if she were a shark,

159
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:01,945
there's nothing she can do at a karaoke shop.

160
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:03,045
Yes.

161
00:10:03,045 --> 00:10:05,145
But, how dare she go out without telling me.

162
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:09,145
I have no idea at all what's on her mind.

163
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:12,445
A worry that comes along with having a young wife, huh?

164
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,045
It wasn't supposed to be this way.

165
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:18,145
This is had recently become a habitual phrase between Nagisa and I.

166
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:36,845
The low atmospheric pressure has passed at daybreak.

167
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,445
The tides are all the way off-shore.

168
00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:41,845
It's a beautiful sandy beach, right, Conan?

169
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:44,145
True.

170
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,645
Pops.

171
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,145
What could that be?

172
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:52,145
A drifting wood or something.

173
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,445
No?

174
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,145
Isn't that someone wearing a wet suit?

175
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:57,145
Don't tell me that...

176
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:06,145
This is...

177
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:07,945
Nagisa?

178
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,945
No good. She's dead.

179
00:11:11,945 --> 00:11:13,245
No.

180
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:16,045
That's...

181
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,345
At any rate, you contact the police, Ran!

182
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:22,445
-You bring Mr. Imaoka, Kid. -Yup!

183
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:23,745
And while you're at it,

184
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:26,645
go get some cardboards to put around the corpse too.

185
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,945
Okay!

186
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:34,045
I guess the passion of the surfer girl couldn't be stopped.

187
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:38,945
This is probably a homicide.

188
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:40,545
But...

189
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:42,345
the only footprints surrounding the corpse are ours,

190
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:44,945
when we came running over to the body.

191
00:11:46,145 --> 00:11:49,745
How on earth did the culprit...

192
00:11:53,637 --> 00:11:58,537
Nagisa...

193
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:04,337
What the?

194
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:06,337
Sand?

195
00:12:06,337 --> 00:12:08,137
Why in a place like that?

196
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:12,737
Nagisa.

197
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:14,737
Hold on. He's...

198
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:16,237
Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

199
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:17,437
Yeah.

200
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,537
He appears on TV a lot, doesn't he?

201
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:21,737
Let's go get his autograph later.

202
00:12:21,737 --> 00:12:22,837
I guess so.

203
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:31,337
And, Mr. Mouri, did you figure something out yet?

204
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:35,337
Briefly speaking, I would say that

205
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,037
this is an unfortunate accident.

206
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,737
So, it's an accident after all.

207
00:12:39,737 --> 00:12:41,537
Yes.

208
00:12:41,537 --> 00:12:45,237
Nagisa, at seeing the rough sea brought about the low atmospheric pressure,

209
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:49,237
probably couldn't hold her impulse in check.

210
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:51,437
Therefore, she lied to her husband, Mr. Imaoka

211
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,537
and sent him a mail saying that she was going to karaoke.

212
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:57,737
She secretly wore the wet suit that was in the workshop

213
00:12:57,737 --> 00:12:59,437
and took the surfboard that was there too,

214
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:01,637
then headed for the sea from the backdoor.

215
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:05,137
But, I wonder why she didn't wear her own wet suit

216
00:13:05,137 --> 00:13:08,137
that is hanging over there?

217
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:09,637
True.

218
00:13:09,637 --> 00:13:11,137
That's probably because

219
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:15,437
she thought that I, being in the kitchen would see her.

220
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:19,637
And if I did catch her going, she knew that I would stop her.

221
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:23,937
Nagisa really loved surfing, you see.

222
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,737
I truly understand how she feels.

223
00:13:27,737 --> 00:13:32,637
And while she was enjoying surfing a large wave came and flustered her,

224
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:36,937
it just so happened that the leash cord wrapped around Nagisa's neck.

225
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:39,137
In addition, the waves pulled the boat along too.

226
00:13:39,137 --> 00:13:43,137
And as a result, she eventually was choked to death.

227
00:13:45,637 --> 00:13:50,737
But the strangulation mark is inside the wet suit.

228
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,537
So what?

229
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,437
She was up against the rough sea.

230
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:02,837
The cord could've gotten inside her wet suit!

231
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:05,537
But the suit is tightly close to the body

232
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:07,137
so that water doesn't go inside it, you know.

233
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:11,637
What a nuisance! Now, get out of here, brat.

234
00:14:11,637 --> 00:14:14,837
And, although the boat got lost,

235
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:17,637
Nagisa found her way back to this beach

236
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:20,237
where her beloved husband, Mr. Imaoka is!

237
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:21,437
Very sharp of you.

238
00:14:21,437 --> 00:14:23,637
What sharp power of observation.

239
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:26,237
Huh? Her pedicure isn't complete.

240
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:29,837
True.

241
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:33,637
I wonder if she went to the beach in the midst of doing pedicure.

242
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:36,537
What's this? Something's not...

243
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:40,037
Mr. Imaoka!

244
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:43,437
Nagisa's been washed up on the beach!

245
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:48,737
Mr. Imaoka!

246
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:50,337
Those plastic bags!

247
00:15:01,537 --> 00:15:04,337
So this is homicide after all!

248
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,937
And the culprit is...

249
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:15,737
Huh? The footprints of a person weighing more than 100 kilograms?

250
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:19,137
Yup, for example, if a person weighing 60 kilograms

251
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:21,537
carries a person weighing 50 kilograms on his back,

252
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:24,337
a deep footprint would remain, right?

253
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:26,537
Beats me.

254
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:28,037
Either way,

255
00:15:28,037 --> 00:15:31,137
when we got here, there were no such footprints,

256
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:33,037
and it was just a beautiful sandy beach.

257
00:15:33,037 --> 00:15:35,137
I see, thank you.

258
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:37,037
You're welcome.

259
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,437
Darn.

260
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,137
I'm sure that he's the culprit

261
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:44,737
but how did he carry the corpse to the beach?

262
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:47,137
I've got to figure that out first.

263
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:51,437
What's this?

264
00:15:51,437 --> 00:15:54,137
Was it crushed by something?

265
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:58,137
It was crushed by something...

266
00:16:09,037 --> 00:16:10,837
Could it be that...

267
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:14,737
I found it!

268
00:16:22,737 --> 00:16:26,337
I see! So, that's the story.

269
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:31,537
Nagisa was embraced by the sea.

270
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:32,837
Yes.

271
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:35,137
And journeyed off.

272
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:37,337
Let's think of it that way...

273
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:44,337
Dad?

274
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,437
This is...

275
00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:48,537
That's what I'd like to say,

276
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:51,737
but this is a homicide made to look like an accident.

277
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:54,037
What? Homicide?

278
00:16:54,037 --> 00:16:56,037
Yes, that's right.

279
00:16:56,037 --> 00:16:59,637
Please look at Nagisa's left toenail.

280
00:16:59,637 --> 00:17:02,737
The pedicure is only halfway through, isn't it?

281
00:17:02,737 --> 00:17:04,837
Don't you think it strange that she would go out to sea

282
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:06,837
while she was still partway through?

283
00:17:06,837 --> 00:17:08,237
True.

284
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:13,337
I thought it was strange when Conan mentioned it to me a while ago too.

285
00:17:13,337 --> 00:17:17,837
She only stopped partway because she had no other choice.

286
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:23,037
Because she was killed

287
00:17:23,037 --> 00:17:26,537
while putting on a pedicure.

288
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:28,237
Mr. Imaoka.

289
00:17:28,237 --> 00:17:30,137
By you!

290
00:17:33,537 --> 00:17:36,537
Mr. Mouri, what're you talking about, out of the blue?

291
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:39,637
Please look at the strangulation mark on Nagisa's neck.

292
00:17:40,837 --> 00:17:44,037
A part of his below her wet suit, is it not?

293
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:45,337
It's because

294
00:17:45,337 --> 00:17:47,537
in order to make it look like an accident,

295
00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:49,737
after you strangled her with the leash cord,

296
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:52,237
you put the wet suit back on her.

297
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,737
Please wait, Mr. Mouri.

298
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:56,837
You know too, don't you?

299
00:17:56,837 --> 00:18:00,037
That a lot of strength is needed to wear a wet suit.

300
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,337
If Nagisa was already dead,

301
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:03,737
although the example is not in good taste,

302
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:07,437
she would be as soft as a devils tongue, wouldn't she?

303
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:09,237
How on earth could I have made Nagisa,

304
00:18:09,237 --> 00:18:11,237
who was in that condition wear the wet suit?

305
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:15,337
Shall we try it, then?

306
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:18,937
Sakata, you're a corpse, so don't move.

307
00:18:18,937 --> 00:18:22,037
-Yes, sir. -There!

308
00:18:22,037 --> 00:18:25,737
It's true that the foot comes out without having to exert much strength.

309
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,637
There, now for the other side.

310
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:33,437
The plastic bag that is covering the foot eases the friction.

311
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:35,837
Please look at the trash container that Ran has brought.

312
00:18:37,637 --> 00:18:40,137
The remains of the pedicure in the plastic bag.

313
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:42,837
It should match Nagisa's foot.

314
00:18:42,837 --> 00:18:44,637
I see, I see.

315
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:47,037
So the culprit made her wear the wet suit using the plastic bag,

316
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:48,337
put her on the rubber boat,

317
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:50,537
and disposed of it off-shore.

318
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:54,037
Then, the body wash washed up to shore in the morning.

319
00:18:54,037 --> 00:18:55,537
That's probably what happened.

320
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:57,037
Please wait.

321
00:18:57,037 --> 00:19:00,437
Since when do you claim I took out the rubber boat?

322
00:19:00,437 --> 00:19:02,937
Yesterday at sundown or at night.

323
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:04,137
Low atmospheric pressure was here,

324
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:06,337
and the sea was bellowing, you know.

325
00:19:06,337 --> 00:19:09,137
The rubber boat would sink.

326
00:19:09,137 --> 00:19:10,737
Then, maybe it was this morning

327
00:19:10,737 --> 00:19:11,737
after the low atmospheric pressure passed,

328
00:19:11,737 --> 00:19:13,837
and the sea calmed down?

329
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:15,837
Enough already!

330
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:18,537
It's a heavy boat with Nagisa on it, you know.

331
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:22,137
Where on the sandy beach are there tracks of a boat having been dragged?

332
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:24,137
Well...

333
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:28,337
Nagisa went out surfing yesterday at sundown into the rough sea,

334
00:19:28,337 --> 00:19:30,037
and died.

335
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:31,537
And this morning,

336
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,837
she was washed up to this beach.

337
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:38,437
It's true that when we discovered Nagisa,

338
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:42,337
there were no footprints or anything on this vast beach.

339
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:45,837
Just as if she was washed up here by the sea.

340
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:47,737
However, Mr. Imaoka.

341
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:50,537
You looked at the plastic model on that shelf over there

342
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:53,637
and thought up the trick that you used to commit this crime.

343
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:57,537
The plastic models?

344
00:19:57,537 --> 00:19:58,937
You mean this.

345
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:01,437
The crane truck.

346
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:02,737
You stretched out the tip,

347
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:05,437
tied the corpse to the rope,

348
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,137
and swayed it to both sides like the pendulum of a clock

349
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:11,737
and cut it off where the movement hit maximum.

350
00:20:11,737 --> 00:20:14,037
I'm sorry. Well, at any rate,

351
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:16,937
the deceased would fly through the air and fall into the sea.

352
00:20:16,937 --> 00:20:19,337
There would be no footprints in the sand.

353
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:20,937
How is it, Mr. Mouri?

354
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:22,437
Wrong!

355
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:25,537
Mr. Imaoka,

356
00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:27,837
after killing Nagisa,

357
00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:30,437
you buried her into the sand and hid her.

358
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,537
The mail about the karaoke was what you had schemed.

359
00:20:33,537 --> 00:20:34,837
And then, this morning,

360
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:36,837
you dug Nagisa out,

361
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:39,137
carried her on your back and moved her.

362
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,237
But, it's the weight of two people, you know.

363
00:20:42,237 --> 00:20:44,037
Of course, you'd have to find footprints.

364
00:20:44,037 --> 00:20:48,837
You used a certain thing so as not to leave footprints behind.

365
00:20:48,837 --> 00:20:51,837
"Crawler" -Using the heavy machinery, the crawler, as a hint.

366
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:58,737
Mr. Imaoka, you connected this and made a loop, right?

367
00:20:58,737 --> 00:21:00,437
I see.

368
00:21:00,437 --> 00:21:03,637
You carried Nagisa on your back, went inside

369
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,037
and moved along the sandy beach.

370
00:21:06,037 --> 00:21:09,237
Then, you left Nagisa there and returned.

371
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:12,637
Well? Am I wrong?

372
00:21:19,337 --> 00:21:23,437
Last night, it was after all of you had left.

373
00:21:23,437 --> 00:21:27,137
Nagisa... She said...

374
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:31,337
Tomorrow morning,

375
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:35,137
I'm going to meet him under the solitary pine tree.

376
00:21:35,137 --> 00:21:38,737
Once I'm settled, I'll send you the divorce paper.

377
00:21:38,737 --> 00:21:42,137
You have no intention of thinking it over?

378
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:44,037
What it comes down to is

379
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:48,037
what the world requires is either looks or money.

380
00:21:50,137 --> 00:21:51,937
Please forget about me.

381
00:21:55,837 --> 00:22:02,437
Nagisa married me only for the money.

382
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:04,737
Darn!

383
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:29,837
Now, the last 100m straight!

384
00:23:29,837 --> 00:23:31,237
Tawaru Gitaka's being followed by...

385
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:33,937
Go, go for it!

386
00:23:33,937 --> 00:23:36,237
Run for it! Run for it! Run for it!

387
00:23:36,237 --> 00:23:38,037
Go and run for it!

388
00:23:43,137 --> 00:23:45,437
Just as expected, a man who can't ride the waves

389
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:47,337
can't ride horses either.

390
00:23:47,337 --> 00:23:49,837
Why does this happen to me?

391
00:23:49,837 --> 00:23:53,137
Gosh, I've had enough!

392
00:23:53,737 --> 00:23:56,537
"Next Episode"

393
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:58,037
No doubt about it.

394
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,737
The cause of death is by gunshot.

395
00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:04,237
All suspicions incurred on me will be cleared!

396
00:24:04,237 --> 00:24:06,937
By me, Ryoma Sakamoto!

397
00:24:06,937 --> 00:24:10,437
We've time-slipped.

398
00:24:10,437 --> 00:24:13,837
Ask the daughter of the shipping agency Miuraya, Otei,

399
00:24:13,837 --> 00:24:15,537
for the details.

400
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,237
Figures will solve everything.

401
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:19,537
Next Conan,

402
00:24:19,537 --> 00:24:23,137
"The Nagasaki Mystery Theater (End of the Edo Era)".
