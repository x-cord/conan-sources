1
00:00:02,258 --> 00:00:05,258
Ai, the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

2
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:09,458
and I came to the campsite on Dr. Agasa's Beetle.

3
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:11,258
Doc and I separated with the members of the detective squad

4
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:14,058
to go and shop for the canteens that Doc forgot to bring.

5
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:16,458
We coincidentally run into Masumi Sera.

6
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:19,458
She decides to join us at the campsite.

7
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,658
On the other hand, Ai and the members of the detective squad

8
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:25,558
who go into the forest to pick firewood.

9
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:29,958
There, they run into a man who is burying the dead body of a woman!

10
00:00:30,858 --> 00:00:32,258
A woman...

11
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:34,358
Is being buried.

12
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:37,058
Run!

13
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:38,858
Ai and the children flee desperately

14
00:00:38,858 --> 00:00:41,058
unable to get though to me.

15
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:43,958
They decide to hide in a mountain cabin in the forest.

16
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,758
How about it, Mitsuhiko?

17
00:00:47,758 --> 00:00:51,358
There seems to be no other entrance. That's the only one.

18
00:00:53,758 --> 00:00:56,458
Hey, what's the matter?

19
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,558
I'm fine.

20
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,458
The floor was just wet.

21
00:01:06,558 --> 00:01:07,958
It can't be...

22
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:11,158
The woman a while ago was...

23
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:15,158
If so, 9 out of 10 he'll come back here

24
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,058
to this blood smeared site of the crime.

25
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:20,358
The culprit...

26
00:01:20,358 --> 00:01:22,958
Then, we'll have to hurry out of here.

27
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,358
True!

28
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:27,358
At that time, we joined Inspector Yamamura and the others

29
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:29,558
who had come to the site after being contacted by Ai.

30
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:31,258
The three suspects thought

31
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,358
to have been burying the corpse were also found.

32
00:01:34,658 --> 00:01:35,858
Big trouble!

33
00:01:35,858 --> 00:01:39,958
The door's chained and we can't get out!

34
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:43,258
Ai! We've been locked in!

35
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:48,458
Ai. Doesn't it smell like something's burning?

36
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,558
Come to think of it, yes.

37
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:53,758
It can't be...

38
00:01:53,758 --> 00:01:56,558
Isn't this mountain cabin burning?

39
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:57,958
We've got to hurry and flee!

40
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:01,358
Darn it! This door won't budge!

41
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:05,058
What shall we do? We don't have the strength.

42
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,058
We'll be fine, calm down!

43
00:02:09,058 --> 00:02:11,358
I'm sure someone will notice the smoke

44
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:13,558
and come to rescue us.

45
00:02:13,558 --> 00:02:15,258
That' right.

46
00:02:15,258 --> 00:02:16,758
Conan.

47
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:23,458
Smoke?

48
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:27,058
Hey, it's some distance away but there's smoke rising!

49
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:32,058
That's probably the smoke from a camp fire.

50
00:02:32,058 --> 00:02:34,158
See, there's another one over there, too.

51
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:36,858
For some reason recently, a lot of young kids

52
00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:40,958
make large bonfires from noon and really live it up.

53
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,358
Inspector Yamamura!

54
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:45,358
Regarding the report we got earlier,

55
00:02:45,358 --> 00:02:48,258
I brought the three men.

56
00:02:48,258 --> 00:02:50,958
Is that right? Good work!

57
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:15,058
Aim for a 100% solution.

58
00:03:15,058 --> 00:03:17,258
Clear all mysteries and codes.

59
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:18,958
A dark shadow that closes in on Ai.

60
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,058
A small mistake that was left behind.

61
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:22,558
He sees through the one and only truth.

62
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:24,458
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

63
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,858
His name is Detective Conan!

64
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:12,199
"Shadow Closes on Ai's Secret (Part 2)"

65
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:15,726
Then, will you all one by one give me your names, occupation

66
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:19,126
and the reason you came here.

67
00:05:19,126 --> 00:05:23,126
I'm Hayamichi Yonezumi, a free-lancer.

68
00:05:23,126 --> 00:05:25,526
I don't know what happened,

69
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:28,626
but since I'm coming here next week with my friends,

70
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:30,026
I came to check this place out!

71
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:32,926
My name is Chozo Usagi.

72
00:05:32,926 --> 00:05:34,526
I'm a photographer.

73
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:38,526
I take pictures of campsites throughout Japan.

74
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:41,526
I also came to take pictures.

75
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:43,326
I wanted to take pictures of Japanese azalea

76
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:45,426
on my cell phone camera to upload on my blog

77
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:48,826
because they bloom orange flowers during this season.

78
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:51,226
My name is Takeya Iwakuma.

79
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,326
I'm a senior at Beika University.

80
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:57,226
But you're all dressed very lightly.

81
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:59,526
I just came to check the place out, you know.

82
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,726
Same with me.

83
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:04,826
My camera and equipment are in my car.

84
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:08,126
I just dropped by.

85
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:10,526
How is it?

86
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:12,826
I can't get through yet.

87
00:06:12,826 --> 00:06:15,126
I'm sure that Ai would move to a place

88
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:17,926
where the cell phone will work.

89
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:20,126
If they're still being pursued by the culprit

90
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:22,226
and she can't make the call because of it,

91
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:25,726
then maybe the culprit's not among the three?

92
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:28,926
Or I don't want to think this,

93
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:31,726
but maybe they've already been killed by someone

94
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:34,226
including those three.

95
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,126
Or they may be in a situation

96
00:06:36,126 --> 00:06:38,826
where that can't move for some reason.

97
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:47,026
Everybody, get a hold of yourself!

98
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:49,826
Keep your heads down low to avoid inhaling smoke!

99
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,426
I'm sure that help is on the way!

100
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:57,326
But I wonder when they'll come?

101
00:06:57,326 --> 00:07:00,126
There's smoke over on the other side, too.

102
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:02,026
I wonder if it's a camp fire?

103
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:03,226
No!

104
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:07,126
Then maybe they won't notice our smoke?

105
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,026
Oh, no.

106
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:12,326
I've got no choice than... but to...

107
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:17,326
All three of them wear size 26 (cm)?

108
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:19,626
-Really? -Yeah.

109
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:21,326
My shoe size, right?

110
00:07:21,326 --> 00:07:23,426
What about it?

111
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:27,226
Darn it. If the culprit is among those three,

112
00:07:27,226 --> 00:07:28,526
the sooner the better to find out who he is,

113
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:30,426
so that we can get info on where everyone is.

114
00:07:30,426 --> 00:07:32,326
That's the fastest way.

115
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,126
How troubling.

116
00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:38,226
The detective badges of the children were all in the tent.

117
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:41,726
I think we should go to search, too.

118
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:43,526
Going in search randomly

119
00:07:43,526 --> 00:07:45,026
will just get us lost in the forest!

120
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:47,026
I think we should let the search team

121
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:49,826
who know about the mountains do their job.

122
00:07:49,826 --> 00:07:52,826
But the sun's starting to set

123
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:55,126
and our shadows are getting longer, too.

124
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:57,926
We've got to find them before it gets dark.

125
00:07:57,926 --> 00:07:59,526
-Shadow? -Shadow?

126
00:08:02,526 --> 00:08:04,326
I see.

127
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:06,126
So, that's the story.

128
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,926
Ayumi?

129
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:17,026
Get a hold of yourself! Ayumi!

130
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:19,426
Ayumi! Get up, Ayumi!

131
00:08:19,426 --> 00:08:22,826
Genta! Let's take Ayumi closer to the door!

132
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:24,626
We've got to make her breathe the air outside!

133
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:27,426
I see! Get a hold of yourself, Ayumi!

134
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:28,526
We're going to move you!

135
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:31,426
I'll let you breathe delicious air right now!

136
00:08:31,426 --> 00:08:34,026
Here, it's air from outside! Ayumi!

137
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:36,326
It's good, isn't it? Right, Ayumi?

138
00:08:36,326 --> 00:08:38,626
Get a hold of yourself, Ayumi!

139
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:41,426
Ayumi! Get up, Ayumi!

140
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:42,926
Ayumi!

141
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:47,726
What was that sound?

142
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:49,326
It looks like the door opened.

143
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:52,526
It can't be. We're the only ones here.

144
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:56,826
Don't tell me that the culprit came back.

145
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:38,273
Hey, officer.

146
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:41,573
Isn't it about time you tell us what's going on?

147
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:44,473
You've got to tell us

148
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:47,073
or I can't cooperate anymore.

149
00:09:47,073 --> 00:09:50,773
I've got things to do after this too, you see.

150
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:52,173
The thing is,

151
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:55,873
the body of a woman was found dumped in the mountain.

152
00:09:55,873 --> 00:09:58,873
The culprit is still on the run.

153
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:00,273
-What? -What?

154
00:10:00,273 --> 00:10:02,073
That's why we had you,

155
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:05,673
who were walking alone in the mountains come here.

156
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,673
Hey, hey.

157
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:11,473
Will all three of you show me both hands?

158
00:10:11,473 --> 00:10:13,273
-Huh? -Why?

159
00:10:13,273 --> 00:10:15,573
Because I was watching all this time,

160
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,573
but Mr. Yonezumi and Iwakuma used only your left hands.

161
00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:21,573
But, Mr. Usami, you used only your right hand!

162
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:24,473
I just thought that maybe you have a scar on the other hand

163
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:26,773
and is hiding it!

164
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:27,973
Geez.

165
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:31,873
I was using my left hand because I'm left handed.

166
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:34,273
See? My right hand has no scar, does it?

167
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:37,473
Same here. I'm a lefty.

168
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:41,273
I used only my right hand because I'm right handed.

169
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,673
Of course there's nothing on my left hand, too.

170
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:47,973
But, Mr. Usagi...

171
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:50,173
The culprit was also right handed!

172
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:51,573
Huh?

173
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:53,373
What're you talking about?

174
00:10:53,373 --> 00:10:55,173
All you saw was the woman

175
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:58,673
that the culprit was trying to bury and the hole, right?

176
00:10:58,673 --> 00:11:01,873
It was left near the corpse and the hole.

177
00:11:01,873 --> 00:11:05,373
The evidence that the culprit was right-handed!

178
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,573
Evidence?

179
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:09,173
The scar on the victim was slashed from the top right to the bottom

180
00:11:09,173 --> 00:11:11,773
with something like an axe.

181
00:11:11,773 --> 00:11:13,573
Which means that

182
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:16,873
the culprit who slashed her was probably right-handed.

183
00:11:16,873 --> 00:11:19,173
The footprints of the culprit around the hole,

184
00:11:19,173 --> 00:11:21,973
showed that the left foot was in front and the right behind.

185
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,873
Such footprints can't be left behind

186
00:11:23,873 --> 00:11:26,173
unless a right-handed person digs the hole, right?

187
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:30,773
That's true.

188
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:34,673
What? Then, what? Is he the culprit?

189
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:38,673
What? Come on, give me a break.

190
00:11:38,673 --> 00:11:41,873
If you have anything to say, say it now.

191
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:45,773
I mean, there are loads of right-handers around!

192
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:48,273
These two may actually be right-handers that are hiding it

193
00:11:48,273 --> 00:11:52,473
and forcing themselves to use their left.

194
00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:54,973
I wonder about that.

195
00:11:54,973 --> 00:11:56,373
Besides, see...

196
00:11:56,373 --> 00:12:00,173
The culprit may still be hiding in the mountains somewhere.

197
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:03,773
It's true that most Japanese are right-handed,

198
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:06,173
but the only one who, at around the time of the crime,

199
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:07,573
was wandering around this mountain,

200
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:13,273
and called Usami, who is right-handed is you.

201
00:12:13,273 --> 00:12:14,473
What?

202
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:17,573
Come on, Conan.

203
00:12:17,573 --> 00:12:19,973
Where at the site was there such a name?

204
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,373
The woman victim taught us, didn't she?

205
00:12:23,373 --> 00:12:25,773
Inside the sleeping bag she was put in...

206
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:28,873
She made this shape with her fingers and told us.

207
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,573
What of that becomes the name Usagi?

208
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:34,673
It's hard to tell just from the shape made by her fingers,

209
00:12:34,673 --> 00:12:37,973
but if you place the right and left hand on top of each other...

210
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:41,273
And shine a light on it...

211
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:46,373
That's maybe...

212
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:49,773
A rabbit!

213
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:52,073
But why is it shadow drawing?

214
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:53,673
If she made this shape with her fingers,

215
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,973
she could've written words with blood, no?

216
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:57,673
It's because the woman who was killed

217
00:12:57,673 --> 00:13:00,273
was a nursery school teacher!

218
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:01,573
Because job-wise

219
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,773
they probably show shadow pictures to children.

220
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:06,773
Even if the culprit were to find it,

221
00:13:06,773 --> 00:13:09,373
it at first doesn't look like a rabbit.

222
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,273
Her hands probably loosened up

223
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:14,273
when she was being carried around.

224
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:18,973
Well, it's no use trying to play dumb!

225
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:21,573
Being that you inflicted such a wound on the victim's back,

226
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:24,573
you would've had a lot of her blood splattered on yourself.

227
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:27,973
It seems you changed and washed yourself off with water,

228
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,573
you can't erase it that easily.

229
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:36,173
The luminol reaction that detects blood on the body.

230
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:39,173
Then, we should've taken the three to begin,

231
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:41,273
to the station and investigate them.

232
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:42,973
That would've taken too much time,

233
00:13:42,973 --> 00:13:45,173
and looking for the children would've been delayed, right?

234
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:47,073
I see.

235
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:48,673
You're the one, aren't you?

236
00:13:48,673 --> 00:13:51,673
That was seen by my friends when you were burying the body

237
00:13:51,673 --> 00:13:53,473
and later chased them around?

238
00:13:53,473 --> 00:13:56,073
I... It's not me.

239
00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:59,273
Huh? You're still going to keep it up?

240
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,473
I... I'm not the one to blame.

241
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,973
It's her!

242
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:06,873
She had the nerve to confine me in a place like that to tease me.

243
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:09,673
She's to blame!

244
00:14:11,873 --> 00:14:13,673
I loved her and yet...

245
00:14:15,673 --> 00:14:18,473
We were planning to get married, too.

246
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:21,473
Why'd she do something like that?

247
00:14:24,273 --> 00:14:28,473
She confined you.

248
00:14:28,473 --> 00:14:31,773
I'm claustrophobic.

249
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:34,173
Three year ago,

250
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,773
I once was locked into an elevator the whole day through

251
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:38,873
because of an accident.

252
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:44,073
Ever since then, I panic whenever I'm in a dark closed place.

253
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:49,673
Yet, she tried to confine me!

254
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:52,673
In the dark mountain, cabin where not even the windows open.

255
00:14:57,073 --> 00:15:01,673
Then, the one who wanted to come here was the victim?

256
00:15:01,673 --> 00:15:06,073
Yes. I naturally panicked

257
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,673
and tried desperately to escape,

258
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:11,673
but the axe in the cabin that I flung around in the dark

259
00:15:11,673 --> 00:15:14,673
accidentally slashed her back.

260
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:16,173
That's right.

261
00:15:16,173 --> 00:15:18,873
Only if she didn't do that,

262
00:15:18,873 --> 00:15:21,173
I wouldn't have locked the children in either.

263
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:25,973
You locked them in the cabin?

264
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:27,273
Yeah.

265
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:31,273
But I think it's too late already.

266
00:15:31,273 --> 00:15:32,373
Don't tell me that

267
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:34,173
he locked them in the mountain cabin and set fire to it?

268
00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:35,973
Inspector Yamamura!

269
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:36,973
We got a report from the search team

270
00:15:36,973 --> 00:15:39,673
saying that they found a mountain cabin on fire.

271
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,873
And was it extinguished?

272
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:46,073
It seems that when found the cabin was burning out of control.

273
00:15:46,073 --> 00:15:47,473
Hey. You folks!

274
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:02,273
No. It can't be...

275
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:05,873
Darn it!

276
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:07,673
No, no! Don't go near it!

277
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:11,173
Let me go! My friends... my friends are inside!

278
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:13,273
-What? -Let me go!

279
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,773
Genta! Mitsuhiko!

280
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:18,773
Ai! Ayumi!

281
00:16:27,473 --> 00:16:28,973
Yes!

282
00:16:28,973 --> 00:16:32,173
Conan! Over here!

283
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:36,673
We're okay, too!

284
00:16:36,673 --> 00:16:38,473
You guys...

285
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:40,073
How on earth did you...

286
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:43,973
A strange lady suddenly appeared and saved us.

287
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:46,373
She broke the door open with the axe!

288
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:50,573
It seems she was living in the attic of the cabin.

289
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:52,373
Where's Ai?

290
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:55,573
As for Ai, she was the first to be saved,

291
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:58,373
and was told to escape to a safe place.

292
00:16:58,373 --> 00:17:01,673
I got a call from Ai a while ago,

293
00:17:01,673 --> 00:17:04,173
so we know she's safe.

294
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:05,473
That girl...

295
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:07,573
Don't tell me that she used the antidote.

296
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:09,973
Which way did that lady go?

297
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:13,073
She told us to hide until you and the others came

298
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,273
and went over that way.

299
00:17:14,273 --> 00:17:16,273
You guys wait there!

300
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:23,373
I'd like to interrogate the children, too.

301
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:26,573
But they may have inhaled smoke,

302
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:29,073
so we'll have to get a doctor to examine them.

303
00:17:29,073 --> 00:17:32,073
Then, please bring them over to the station after that.

304
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:33,673
Hey, you guys!

305
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:37,173
Do you remember what the lady was like?

306
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:38,973
She was pretty.

307
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:41,373
She looked a bit like Ai, right?

308
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:45,273
That's why I sent the movie that I secretly took!

309
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,273
You sent a movie?

310
00:17:47,273 --> 00:17:48,673
Yes.

311
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:51,573
I wanted to thank her later,

312
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:53,273
so I sent it to the Mouri Detective Agency,

313
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,573
to have them find her.

314
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:59,573
I promised to send them pictures of the camp to begin with, anyway.

315
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:02,773
See, this is her!

316
00:18:02,773 --> 00:18:04,473
But we may be able to see her next week

317
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:06,273
even if we don't look for her.

318
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:08,773
Because she...

319
00:18:08,773 --> 00:18:11,773
Ai! Where are you?

320
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:13,073
Ai!

321
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:18,773
You're late.

322
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:20,973
I believed that "you know who"

323
00:18:20,973 --> 00:18:23,973
was going to come to rescue us and yet...

324
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:26,873
I didn't think that I would end up having to drink that antidote

325
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,973
to return to my former size.

326
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:32,773
Where'd you get those clothes?

327
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:34,273
I borrowed the clothes

328
00:18:34,273 --> 00:18:37,673
that I found in the cabin of the woman that killed!

329
00:18:37,673 --> 00:18:41,973
I couldn't go out in front of the children stark naked.

330
00:18:41,973 --> 00:18:44,773
Well, but since my body grew,

331
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:46,973
I couldn't remove this ring.

332
00:18:46,973 --> 00:18:49,373
As for the clothes, I got to change everything.

333
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:55,173
I hope the children haven't noticed that I'm Ai Haibara.

334
00:18:55,173 --> 00:18:57,873
Okay then, why don't you hide in the tent

335
00:18:57,873 --> 00:19:00,373
until the drug wears off?

336
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:03,173
They're going to be interrogated.

337
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:07,473
By the way, you did catch the murderer?

338
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:10,873
Yes. It was the photographer.

339
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:14,173
I realized it when I saw her dying message.

340
00:19:14,173 --> 00:19:16,073
He's claustrophobic,

341
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:19,873
and he said he was almost locked up in the cabin.

342
00:19:19,873 --> 00:19:23,873
I get it. It matches.

343
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:26,973
In her bag with her clothes,

344
00:19:26,973 --> 00:19:30,273
there was a book about claustrophobia.

345
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:33,073
She was trying help him overcome the phobia

346
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:34,973
by taking him into that cabin,

347
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,373
and staying with him throughout the night.

348
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:40,273
But that kind of drastic measure backfired.

349
00:19:40,273 --> 00:19:42,373
He panicked,

350
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:45,173
and unfortunately she was murdered.

351
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:48,173
What a story about an unwanted noble gesture.

352
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:52,773
That type of phobia doesn't have to be cured to lead a normal life.

353
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:56,373
It might have been because he was a photographer.

354
00:19:56,373 --> 00:20:00,273
If he was using a film type camera

355
00:20:00,273 --> 00:20:03,273
and if he can't handle being in a small dark room,

356
00:20:03,273 --> 00:20:06,373
for a photographer that could ruin him.

357
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,673
She probably wanted him to be his old self again.

358
00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:14,773
Didn't she leave evidence that he was the killer?

359
00:20:14,773 --> 00:20:16,673
She was holding a grudge against him.

360
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,873
No.

361
00:20:17,873 --> 00:20:21,673
If that's so, it wasn't her dying message.

362
00:20:21,673 --> 00:20:26,073
Maybe she just wanted to die hugging it.

363
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:30,073
A rabbit, the form of the person she loved the most.

364
00:21:58,273 --> 00:22:01,773
So, those kids are staying at an Inn in Gunma tonight?

365
00:22:01,773 --> 00:22:05,373
Yep, the camp grounds are still scary.

366
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:08,773
By the way, they sure get involved in many cases.

367
00:22:08,773 --> 00:22:10,973
Hey? Just now, something...

368
00:22:10,973 --> 00:22:12,973
It sounded like a sound came from downstairs.

369
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:14,773
It's the wind, the wind!

370
00:22:14,773 --> 00:22:16,473
It was pretty strong today.

371
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,273
Password...

372
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:26,373
How are both of your passwords?

373
00:22:26,373 --> 00:22:28,873
My birthday.

374
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:32,473
Mine's "KOGOROSAN", 5563.

375
00:22:32,473 --> 00:22:35,273
I meant...

376
00:22:35,273 --> 00:22:38,173
if it's a very long password and you couldn't memorize it...

377
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:40,673
5563...

378
00:22:42,873 --> 00:22:45,773
What was received weren't pictures... a movie?

379
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:57,573
All right now. Until your friends arrive,

380
00:22:57,573 --> 00:22:59,573
keep quiet and out of sight.

381
00:23:06,373 --> 00:23:09,173
Mystery Train pass ring...

382
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:12,373
Bell Tree Express.

383
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:18,273
I'm being hacked.

384
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:19,673
Who is it?

385
00:23:42,373 --> 00:23:44,273
"Next Episode"

386
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:45,373
Congratulations!

387
00:23:45,373 --> 00:23:48,473
You've been chosen to play the role of the detective.

388
00:23:48,473 --> 00:23:52,073
I'll bet all the passengers are detectives.

389
00:23:52,073 --> 00:23:53,273
Excuse me.

390
00:23:53,273 --> 00:23:54,773
Idiot! Don't come in!

391
00:23:54,773 --> 00:23:55,873
Huh?

392
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,673
We've met for the first time, right?

393
00:24:02,673 --> 00:24:05,273
She is...

394
00:24:05,273 --> 00:24:06,873
Don't tell me...

395
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:12,398
