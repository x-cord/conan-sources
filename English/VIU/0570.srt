1
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:12,109
What?

2
00:00:13,697 --> 00:00:16,997
That lady, she's been sitting in that seat

3
00:00:16,997 --> 00:00:19,297
"Kyoko Takahata (35)" -since we got here.

4
00:00:19,297 --> 00:00:21,297
What a beauty!

5
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:23,897
True.

6
00:00:23,897 --> 00:00:26,397
It's been two hours already.

7
00:00:33,097 --> 00:00:35,297
Hello.

8
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:36,897
Speaking.

9
00:00:37,897 --> 00:00:39,797
What?

10
00:00:39,797 --> 00:00:42,697
What did you say?

11
00:00:46,097 --> 00:00:48,097
Are you all right?

12
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:49,597
Pardon me.

13
00:00:49,597 --> 00:00:51,397
Is something wrong?

14
00:00:51,397 --> 00:00:53,897
If it's okay with you, please tell me about it.

15
00:00:53,897 --> 00:00:56,897
My name is Kogoro Mouri.

16
00:00:56,897 --> 00:00:59,297
Oh? You're that great detective?

17
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:00,897
That's right!

18
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:04,697
Actually, I just got a call from the police.

19
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,097
Someone has died in my home.

20
00:01:07,097 --> 00:01:08,997
What was that?

21
00:01:11,597 --> 00:01:13,597
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

22
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:15,597
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

23
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:17,497
Today's case is pretty tough.

24
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:19,497
What's the crime that cannot be proven?

25
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:21,397
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:23,297
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:23,297 --> 00:01:25,297
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

28
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:12,327
"The Crime with Zero Possibility to be Proven"

29
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,228
"Takahata"

30
00:03:18,428 --> 00:03:22,728
The deceased is Itsuro Soejima, 27 years old.

31
00:03:22,728 --> 00:03:26,028
He is the husband of Shiori, whose sister,

32
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:28,128
Kyoko Takahata, is the owner of this house.

33
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:35,828
These are a fallen chandelier and a shotgun.

34
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:39,228
Looks like the gun accidentally went off.

35
00:03:46,428 --> 00:03:49,028
Is something wrong?

36
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:52,428
No. It's nothing.

37
00:03:52,428 --> 00:03:55,328
And to our surprise...

38
00:03:57,828 --> 00:03:59,028
Sorry, I'm late.

39
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:01,328
What took you so long, Chiba?

40
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,328
I apologize.

41
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:08,028
Soejima? This can't be!

42
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:12,228
The victim was actually officer Chiba's friend back in college.

43
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:14,728
What happened here?

44
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:16,728
His shotgun suddenly discharged,

45
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:19,928
causing the chandelier to fall and crash on his head.

46
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,128
What's the estimated time of death?

47
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:25,128
Approximately an hour ago.

48
00:04:25,128 --> 00:04:27,028
In other words,

49
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:30,328
he entered the house by himself while she was out.

50
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:32,728
He consumed alcohol to the point of getting drunk,

51
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:35,328
grabbed the shotgun from the cabinet

52
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:37,028
and loaded the gun.

53
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:40,628
While he was fooling around with it, it went off.

54
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:42,628
No way.

55
00:04:42,628 --> 00:04:44,528
So Itsuro really...

56
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:46,728
I was worried that

57
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:48,928
something like this would happen.

58
00:04:48,928 --> 00:04:50,928
What do you mean?

59
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:53,928
I don't want to say this...

60
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:57,928
Itsurou would start new business after business and fail,

61
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:00,028
going into further debt.

62
00:05:00,028 --> 00:05:03,228
He caused my little sister Shiori to suffer.

63
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:05,928
However, he continued drinking

64
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:08,828
and caused more trouble to those around him.

65
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:12,228
When my sister died of an illness half a year ago,

66
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,828
his drinking problem worsened.

67
00:05:13,828 --> 00:05:15,928
He would even go to the fitness club

68
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:19,028
and shooting range I introduced him to, wasted on alcohol.

69
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:22,528
-Please stop it. -I said let go, let go!

70
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,728
In the end, the club expelled him,

71
00:05:32,728 --> 00:05:35,428
and his gun license was revoked.

72
00:05:35,428 --> 00:05:38,428
Since then, it seemed he wanted to get his hands on my gun.

73
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:42,328
So that's why he snuck into your house when you were out,

74
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:43,828
and ended up like he did.

75
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:45,828
No way...

76
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:48,728
It's true that he was a drunkard,

77
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:51,028
and he even consulted me about it.

78
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:55,228
But, he said he was going to quit drinking alcohol.

79
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:58,628
He wanted to quit, but he just couldn't.

80
00:05:58,628 --> 00:06:00,328
No... no way.

81
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:02,428
I heard about the incident at the shooting range.

82
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,528
He swore saying that

83
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:07,228
he would never ever touch a gun again!

84
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:10,028
He was blinded by alcohol and simply forgot about it.

85
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:11,428
That can't be it.

86
00:06:11,428 --> 00:06:14,528
If he saw these delicious dishes lying around here,

87
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:17,528
I'll bet he'd start to crave a drink.

88
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:21,828
It's true that these dishes all go well with alcohol.

89
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:25,928
Hey, brat, cut out your smart aleck remarks!

90
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,828
He apparently took the dishes

91
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:31,828
I had prepared beforehand out of the fridge on his own.

92
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:34,128
I guess I'm to be held responsible too.

93
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,528
No, that's not it.

94
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:37,828
Ran!

95
00:06:37,828 --> 00:06:40,028
Conan, shouldn't bother them.

96
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:41,428
But, where is the key?

97
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:42,828
The key?

98
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:45,928
Since she was out, how did this manage to get in?

99
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:49,228
I don't see any traces of the windows or doors being forced open.

100
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:51,428
He carried a spare key, perhaps?

101
00:06:51,428 --> 00:06:52,728
That must be it!

102
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:55,428
But I don't see any spare key, anywhere.

103
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:57,228
And not only that

104
00:06:57,228 --> 00:07:01,228
I don't see this man's wallet or cell phone.

105
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:03,928
Hey! Stop messing around!

106
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:06,728
The spare key is outside the entrance.

107
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:10,028
I told him where it was hidden too.

108
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:12,528
What about where you store the bullets and your shotgun?

109
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:15,028
I'm pretty sure I had all the doors locked.

110
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:17,328
-How about it? -Well, it's old

111
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:20,328
and the locks don't seem to be working so well.

112
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:23,428
If it's like this, anyone can easily open the doors.

113
00:07:23,428 --> 00:07:26,828
If any case, an insecure cabinet such as that doesn't meet

114
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:30,728
the standards of the metropolis firearm storage law!

115
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:32,228
Be prepared to have your license revoked

116
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:35,228
and any punishment that will come along with it.

117
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:36,828
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:40,828
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

119
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,728
But viewing it from a different angle,

120
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,528
that's all she would have to take on,

121
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:47,428
despite the fact that someone had died because of it.

122
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:49,128
As for this case, we'll deem it an accident

123
00:07:49,128 --> 00:07:50,528
and let the jurisdictional precinct handle it.

124
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:54,528
Please wait! I still can't believe this!

125
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:55,728
But look...

126
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:57,628
Let's investigate a little further!

127
00:07:57,628 --> 00:08:00,028
Chiba! Calm yourself down!

128
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:01,828
It's an accident no matter how you look at it!

129
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:02,828
But...

130
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:04,428
Knock it off already!

131
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:07,528
Go outside and cool down!

132
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:18,828
It's understandable to react like that

133
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:21,128
when your friend dies, but...

134
00:08:21,128 --> 00:08:24,328
Say, what were you doing at the cafe terrace?

135
00:08:24,328 --> 00:08:25,528
What?

136
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:30,128
For over two hours, were you waiting for something?

137
00:08:30,128 --> 00:08:33,428
I wasn't waiting for anything.

138
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:34,828
Really?

139
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:37,828
Knock it off now!

140
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:40,528
You go cool yourself down too!

141
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:56,028
What's this?

142
00:08:56,028 --> 00:09:00,628
That is from Soejima's cell phone strap.

143
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:01,828
Really?

144
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:04,228
Yeah, it's a matching strap

145
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:05,928
with the one the late Shiori was using.

146
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:08,928
But there wasn't any cell phone at the scene.

147
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:12,728
Say, can you tell me something?

148
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:19,428
Soejima's personality?

149
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:23,028
When it came to sports, I was only good at judo,

150
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:25,628
but he was good at all of them.

151
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:29,828
At the same time, he couldn't really handle much pressure though.

152
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:34,328
It seemed he began relieving his stress from work, by drinking.

153
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:36,528
Perhaps the trouble he caused

154
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:40,428
wasn't just at the shooting range and the pool?

155
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:43,828
Maybe we should go check out the details

156
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:45,928
a bit more, don't you think?

157
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:47,428
I see.

158
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:51,128
With some luck, maybe we can uncover some new facts.

159
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:52,828
Okay. Let's go.

160
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,328
During our investigation,

161
00:09:57,328 --> 00:10:00,528
we uncovered more of his similar troublesome incidents.

162
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:02,128
Drunk driving.

163
00:10:02,128 --> 00:10:04,028
If it weren't for the guard rail,

164
00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:08,028
the car would have gone over the edge, he would've been dead.

165
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:10,828
That was a month ago.

166
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:14,628
And two months ago...

167
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:19,028
He got drunk and collapsed on the street in the cold winter weather.

168
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:21,728
He would've frozen to death if he had been found any later than he was.

169
00:10:23,028 --> 00:10:26,128
Adding up these similar accidents and incidents,

170
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:28,928
there are a total of nine of them over a span of 6 months.

171
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:33,328
After Shiori's death, Soejima became very depressed.

172
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:36,528
It's true that, for a while his alcohol consumption increased,

173
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:39,728
but he would always say "I'm going to quit for real this time".

174
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:42,828
Then, just as he was getting better,

175
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:44,928
he would relapse once again.

176
00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:48,728
This happened over and over again for half a year.

177
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:50,528
Maybe Mr. Mouri's right,

178
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:55,028
he wanted to quit, but he just couldn't.

179
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:58,028
Still, he was a fortunate guy.

180
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,028
He was just a brother-in-law to her, and yet,

181
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:02,428
all the fines and compensation for the accidents he caused,

182
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,028
as well as someone to take custody of him,

183
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:08,428
were all taken care of by Kyoko.

184
00:11:08,428 --> 00:11:11,228
She was also the one who introduced him to the shooting range

185
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:13,928
and fitness club where he caused trouble

186
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:16,228
as well as the owner of the house with shotguns

187
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:17,728
kept in an insecure cabinet,

188
00:11:17,728 --> 00:11:20,528
plus the owner of a house he could access using a spare key.

189
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:26,328
Say, do you know what "indirect intent" means?

190
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:28,828
Indirect Intent?

191
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:31,628
Indirect intent is when a person foresees

192
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:35,028
that an action is likely to result in a harmful outcome,

193
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,528
but disregards whether it's ensured or not,

194
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:41,028
and follows through with the action regardless.

195
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:45,828
Of course I know that.

196
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:50,228
But Conan, I'm surprised that you know something like that.

197
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:56,028
Well, I heard about it from Pop Kogoro a while ago.

198
00:11:56,028 --> 00:11:58,428
Despite foreseeing that a drunkard like Soejima

199
00:11:58,428 --> 00:12:02,728
might get himself killed under the influence,

200
00:12:02,728 --> 00:12:06,028
she still allows him to drive a car,

201
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:08,428
inviting him to go to a shooting range and swimming pool.

202
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,628
Moreover, she left the house

203
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,728
and allowed him to come, drink, and carry a gun.

204
00:12:12,728 --> 00:12:15,528
He may die, or he may not die...

205
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:18,928
the possibility wasn't 100%, but it wasn't zero, either.

206
00:12:18,928 --> 00:12:21,028
If the culprit bet on that then...

207
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:24,028
Don't tell me...

208
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:30,408
Conan, I've borrowed the keys.

209
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:33,908
But I think we ought to tell Mr. Mouri and the inspector first.

210
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:36,008
Never mind, just hurry it up.

211
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:37,908
Conan.

212
00:12:40,608 --> 00:12:42,108
This room is...

213
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:45,808
It's dark. Where's the switch?

214
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,408
Oh, wait.

215
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:56,108
It was the cell phone recharging indicator light.

216
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,208
Recharging?

217
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,208
Say, whose cell phone is this?

218
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,608
That is Shiori's cell phone.

219
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:07,908
Soejima didn't want Shiori's cell phone date to be deleted,

220
00:13:07,908 --> 00:13:10,208
so he constantly recharged it.

221
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,708
Hang on,

222
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,708
this room should've been vacant for at least half a day.

223
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:19,008
Don't tell me, someone entered this room a couple of minutes ago

224
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:20,408
and used the cell phone?

225
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:23,908
What did you say? Who would do that?

226
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:27,408
Looks like someone really was here.

227
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:30,108
It looks like whoever it was searched the room.

228
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:32,208
Could it be a cat burglar?

229
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,108
If that's the case, whoever it was

230
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:35,408
wouldn't have re-locked the door, right?

231
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:37,008
That's true, but...

232
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:40,208
Not long ago, I received a report from my transceiver

233
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,908
saying that a cat burglar frequenting this neighborhood

234
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,808
was arrested at Beika Station.

235
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:46,408
Wait, don't tell me...

236
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,508
What's this?

237
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:51,708
There's something that looks like glitter.

238
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,108
What?

239
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:56,108
This is...

240
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,608
So that's how it was.

241
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,808
What's this about, Mr. Mouri?

242
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:07,708
Are you suspecting me for something?

243
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,708
No. It's not like that...

244
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,308
Hey, Chiba!

245
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:16,908
What's this about? Calling us here all of a sudden?

246
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:18,208
Explain yourself.

247
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,908
That... that is to say well, that

248
00:14:20,908 --> 00:14:25,508
the culprit of this incident is you, Ms. Kyoko Takahata.

249
00:14:26,508 --> 00:14:28,408
What... what did you say?

250
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:30,308
Further... further explanations

251
00:14:30,308 --> 00:14:33,008
will be given by Mr. Mouri, according to Conan.

252
00:14:33,008 --> 00:14:36,508
Huh? Something like that. I never...

253
00:14:40,808 --> 00:14:43,508
All right, let me explain.

254
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,208
Disregard what I said earlier.

255
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:50,508
I do suspect you. I think it was you who killed Soejima.

256
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:52,808
I killed Itsuro?

257
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,608
This had been planned for over half a year.

258
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,508
No, as long as the plan succeeds,

259
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:01,208
it doesn't matter how long it would take.

260
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,808
It was a long-range murder plan.

261
00:15:03,808 --> 00:15:06,808
A perfect murder based on indirect intent!

262
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,708
Knowing that Mr. Soejima was an alcoholic.

263
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,608
You created numerous situations

264
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:15,308
where he could get himself accidentally killed.

265
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:17,508
Then, all you had to do is wait.

266
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:21,408
Right, while sitting in a cafe terrace, drinking.

267
00:15:21,408 --> 00:15:25,108
That's interesting. Sounds like the plot of a movie or a novel.

268
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:26,708
But do you have evidence?

269
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,808
Evidence, you ask?

270
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:30,808
It's about time for the first piece of evidence,

271
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:34,208
rather, a witness to arrive.

272
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,608
A witness?

273
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:38,308
Chiba, I forced Beika Station to cooperate

274
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:40,208
and brought him here!

275
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,308
Thank you.

276
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,708
I heard nothing about this!

277
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,208
Ah, sorry.

278
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:49,508
Mr. Mouri told me to assist Chiba with this.

279
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:52,208
"Naoya Nishitani (37)" -This man is Naoya Nishitani.

280
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,308
He is a recurring cat burglar

281
00:15:54,308 --> 00:15:55,908
who was arrested by the Beika police yesterday.

282
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:57,408
A cat burglar?

283
00:15:57,408 --> 00:16:01,408
Yes, he broke into this house yesterday,

284
00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:04,208
and watched the incident take place.

285
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,708
What was that?

286
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:09,008
Now, tell us again about the testimony you gave.

287
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:12,908
Like I said, when I was rummaging around on the second floor,

288
00:16:12,908 --> 00:16:17,108
when that guy suddenly came in.

289
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,308
It's Itsuro.

290
00:16:20,308 --> 00:16:22,108
Sis?

291
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:27,208
What's she up to, calling me all the way out here, and yet...

292
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:34,008
No, I can't. I can't drink...

293
00:16:37,808 --> 00:16:40,608
This can't be.

294
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:51,908
Soon he drunk himself into a stupor

295
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:54,508
and took the gun out of the cabinet.

296
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:56,308
Just as I thought it was bad.

297
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:12,308
Every bit of it was being set up.

298
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:15,608
Having her license revoked because of improper storage,

299
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:17,708
is of no concern at this point.

300
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,508
This is nothing more than genuine homicide.

301
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:23,908
Please hold it! It's just his side of the story, isn't it?

302
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:26,408
Who do you trust, me or that burglar?

303
00:17:26,408 --> 00:17:29,708
Aren't you concerned about the whereabouts

304
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,308
of Mr. Soejima's cell phone?

305
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:36,108
Back then, you were trying to find something.

306
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:39,408
That something was Mr. Soejima's cell phone.

307
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,908
You wanted to delete...

308
00:17:41,908 --> 00:17:45,108
What's she up to? Calling me all the way here. And yet...

309
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:48,908
What you used to call Mr. Soejima here,

310
00:17:48,908 --> 00:17:51,908
the data of your text message!

311
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:56,108
Last night, you went into Mr. Soejima's room

312
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,908
and tried to find the cell phone, right?

313
00:17:58,908 --> 00:18:00,908
What're you saying?

314
00:18:00,908 --> 00:18:04,908
That's some impressive nail art.

315
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:09,508
But, is every piece of them there? The rhinestones.

316
00:18:10,908 --> 00:18:12,408
Chiba.

317
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:13,908
Yes, sir.

318
00:18:13,908 --> 00:18:17,008
This was found on the floor near Shiori's cell phone.

319
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:21,208
It was the same thing as your nail decoration, isn't it?

320
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:25,708
And the cell phone?

321
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,408
Well, about that...

322
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,108
After pulling out the money from the wallet,

323
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:33,008
he threw the whole pouch into the river.

324
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:36,108
The data was damaged, impossible to recover.

325
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:39,208
No... no way.

326
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:42,308
What a shame, you couldn't get your evidence.

327
00:18:42,308 --> 00:18:46,508
But regardless, there wasn't such a message in the first place.

328
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:51,608
What I was trying to find was not the message you sent.

329
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:56,908
But, rather, Shiori's cell phone, which you touched.

330
00:18:56,908 --> 00:18:58,508
Even after her death,

331
00:18:58,508 --> 00:19:01,908
Mr. Soejima kept recharging the phone

332
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,608
and cherished it.

333
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:08,908
To him, Shiori still seemed to be alive.

334
00:19:08,908 --> 00:19:11,608
Stop... stop talking nonsense!

335
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,608
That man caused Shiori indescribable pain!

336
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:17,408
He deserved to die for all I care!

337
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:20,908
Now, we're finally getting to hear how you really felt.

338
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:24,808
So what? Are you arresting me?

339
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:27,108
I'm a private detective.

340
00:19:27,108 --> 00:19:30,708
I can neither arrest nor sentence you.

341
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:34,908
A private detective's job is merely to find the truth.

342
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:40,408
This time I found how your younger sister felt.

343
00:19:41,508 --> 00:19:44,208
Shiori's feelings?

344
00:19:45,908 --> 00:19:49,708
You got mail. It's okay, ust go ahead and pick it up.

345
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:52,108
Excuse me.

346
00:19:57,308 --> 00:19:58,908
No... no way.

347
00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:01,908
"Message Log: To Itsurou"

348
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:05,408
It's probably a message from heaven.

349
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:08,308
Why don't you read on?

350
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,108
I'm sorry, Itsuro...

351
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:14,508
I know we've got to work on this together.

352
00:20:14,508 --> 00:20:17,008
We've got to hold on, and yet, I allowed illness to defeat me.

353
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,608
When I get well, promise me that you'll stand on your own feet

354
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,908
and apologize to my older sister.

355
00:20:21,908 --> 00:20:25,108
Don't worry, I know she'll understand.

356
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:26,808
Because she's really kind

357
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,308
and the only sister I have.

358
00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:32,308
Shiori...

359
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:35,808
Could this be?

360
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:40,608
Before she died, Shiori sent this message to Mr. Soejima.

361
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:44,708
All I did was send you the saved message stored inside

362
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,308
Shiori's cell phone.

363
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:48,608
-Conan. -Here!

364
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:51,408
I'm sorry if I surprised you.

365
00:20:51,408 --> 00:20:53,408
Since this was Shiori's cell phone,

366
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:57,008
you didn't check it detail, did you? Yesterday.

367
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:03,608
However, in the end, Shiori died of an illness.

368
00:21:03,608 --> 00:21:07,308
Without knowing Shiori's true feelings,

369
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:12,008
you began your plan to murder Mr. Soejima.

370
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:13,308
It's a lie!

371
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:17,508
Shiori couldn't have... I'm sure she hated that guy.

372
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:21,408
Mr. Soejima truly wanted to stand on his own feet.

373
00:21:21,408 --> 00:21:23,908
If you hadn't let anger control you,

374
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:29,108
you could've seen it as well. His feelings and Shiori's wish!

375
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:31,908
It's up to you from here on now.

376
00:21:31,908 --> 00:21:34,308
After you've learned of Shiori's feelings,

377
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:36,808
will you still turn a blind eye to what you did,

378
00:21:36,808 --> 00:21:41,608
and lie to her constantly for the remainder of your life

379
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:43,308
or...

380
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:46,208
Shiori.

381
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:54,208
Kyoko Takahata confessed everything.

382
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:57,808
However, about how the law

383
00:21:57,808 --> 00:22:00,608
will sentence her crime of "Indirect Intent",

384
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:02,908
will still be a long way from now.

385
00:23:24,008 --> 00:23:27,508
"Detective Mouri Agency" -Wait, what are you doing, Dad?

386
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:31,608
I've come to realize that soaking myself in alcohol is unhealthy.

387
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:33,608
So, by putting beer in front of me,

388
00:23:33,608 --> 00:23:36,008
I'm training myself to resist the temptation.

389
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:38,208
I can't do it!

390
00:23:48,108 --> 00:23:51,308
Resisting too much will only cause stress!

391
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:54,308
You never learn, do you, Pops?

392
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:00,508
The big eater, haunted warehouse.

393
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:01,808
Don't you

394
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:04,708
want to shock Conan out of his wits for a change?

395
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,708
Yes, we'd like to

396
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:10,808
at least once see him look wretched at being beaten by us.

397
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:14,408
No... no way.

398
00:24:14,408 --> 00:24:16,908
I know for a fact

399
00:24:16,908 --> 00:24:19,808
that it was Treasure-laden!

400
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:21,108
Next Conan,

401
00:24:21,108 --> 00:24:26,508
"A Treasure Battle at the Haunted Warehouse (Part 1)"
