1
00:00:01,945 --> 00:00:03,544
Did you get any sleep after that?

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,844
None, but I'm hungry.

3
00:00:06,845 --> 00:00:08,744
Where are we going today?

4
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:11,544
We're visiting power spots.

5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:12,944
A tengu?

6
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:16,544
A tengu appeared in Agata's room?

7
00:00:16,545 --> 00:00:19,944
Yeah, like some kind of special effects movie.

8
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:24,044
So, what did the tengu do after that?

9
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:26,544
When Agata threw his ashtray at it,

10
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:28,444
it went up in flames and vanished.

11
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,344
It went up in flames and vanished?

12
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:32,744
That really does sound like a special effect.

13
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:36,744
According to him, after Nishiki was killed,

14
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:40,044
he returned to his room to rest.

15
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:41,644
Unable to fall asleep,

16
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:44,444
he decided to get a drink at the bar,

17
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:46,545
but he had too much to drink and got drunk.

18
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:56,845
When he came to, he was back in his room.

19
00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:03,245
When he lit a cigarette to have a smoke...

20
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:10,745
he sensed something strange and looked up at the ceiling.

21
00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:20,244
Keiko heard him from the neighboring room.

22
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:25,545
We arrived after she contacted us and saw the tengu, too.

23
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:29,944
If he returned to his room at some point,

24
00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:33,244
it's possible someone took the drunk Agata to his room

25
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:35,544
and set something up.

26
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:38,744
But we didn't find any signs of a trick.

27
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:40,144
Then what about the cipher?

28
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:42,344
There was a new cipher, right?

29
00:01:42,345 --> 00:01:44,645
There wasn't one of those either.

30
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:48,744
But...

31
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:51,344
like the murdered Nishiki,

32
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:54,944
Agata had two bumps on his head.

33
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:56,744
Speaking of bumps,

34
00:01:56,745 --> 00:02:01,344
Keiko Kurachi said she got bumps on her head during filming.

35
00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:02,644
Yeah.

36
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:06,244
She asked the director to re-shoot the final scene

37
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:09,045
and got the bumps then when she tripped.

38
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:12,544
When I saw her earlier,

39
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:15,144
her forehead was still a little swollen,

40
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:17,945
so it's probably true that she tripped.

41
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:23,744
She said looking back, it's possible someone pushed her.

42
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:26,544
When she tripped, she laughed about

43
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:28,144
how she looked like the Kobutori Jisan from the folktale.

44
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:32,644
What? I thought the Kobutori Jisan's bumps were on his cheeks.

45
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:37,344
Each region seems to have its own version of the story.

46
00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:41,744
Anyway, was the blood on the ceiling at Nishiki's murder scene

47
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,944
really his blood?

48
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:47,544
No. The police examined it

49
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:51,044
and determined that only the center of the blood spray.

50
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:54,144
In other words, the bit that dripped on your shoulder

51
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:56,444
was Nishiki's blood,

52
00:02:56,445 --> 00:03:00,445
and the rest was paint sprayed onto the ceiling beforehand.

53
00:03:02,645 --> 00:03:04,444
I knew it.

54
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:07,944
Also, they didn't find the blade

55
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:10,644
used to stab Nishiki at the crime scene.

56
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:15,145
I thought it'd be buried under the pages scattered on the floor.

57
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:20,045
Which means the culprit still has the weapon.

58
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:26,344
Ran, what's wrong?

59
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:28,644
What's wrong?

60
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:32,244
People are saying you and I French kissed in London!

61
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,844
What's going on?

62
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:35,844
What?

63
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:40,044
Nakamichi's telling everyone in a weird Kansai accent.

64
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:44,644
He says, "Those two kids already smooched."

65
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:46,244
Well...

66
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:49,344
That was my voice, but it wasn't actually me.

67
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:53,344
What? It was your voice, but not you?

68
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:56,044
You're not making any sense!

69
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:58,944
-Explain yourself, Shinichi! -Why's he speaking in a Kansai accent?

70
00:03:58,945 --> 00:04:00,144
-Explain myself? -I'm not sure.

71
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:02,344
Apparently, Shinichi told him to do

72
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:05,244
as the Romans do when in Rome.

73
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,144
-Really? -Stop trying to trick me!

74
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:09,244
Hey.

75
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:14,144
Why are your sleeves folded up like that?

76
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:16,044
Normally wouldn't you push your sleeves up like this

77
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:18,344
if they were in the way?

78
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:20,344
I didn't really think about it.

79
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:25,445
It's like a small child was wearing that jacket.

80
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:30,145
You idiot. That's obviously not what happened.

81
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:34,444
It's a poster for the movie Keiko's in.

82
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:35,544
"11/10 National Theatrical Release"

83
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:38,444
"The Fighting Red Tengu", huh?

84
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,244
But considering what happened to the scriptwriter Nishiki,

85
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:44,144
it might not open.

86
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:45,544
Yeah.

87
00:04:45,545 --> 00:04:48,444
I wonder what it's about.

88
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:50,844
It's set in the Edo Period.

89
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:54,744
A police officer of the Kyoto magistrate's office named Kuranosuke

90
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:56,444
asks the magistrate

91
00:04:56,445 --> 00:05:00,944
if there's anything unusual he can offer the general.

92
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:03,044
Hearing this,

93
00:05:03,045 --> 00:05:04,544
his wife Mana presents her husband

94
00:05:04,545 --> 00:05:08,344
with a golden paper plant leaf and says to him...

95
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:09,944
I found this paper plant leaf

96
00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:11,744
while foraging for vegetables in the mountains.

97
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:15,244
Since it seemed divine, I always prayed to it with clasped hands,

98
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:17,744
but I have brought it for you.

99
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:19,344
Now, this is truly unusual.

100
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:21,644
I'm sure the general will be delighted.

101
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:25,444
Saying that, Kuranosuke thanks Mana.

102
00:05:25,445 --> 00:05:27,644
But after that day,

103
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:29,944
strange monsters began appearing every night in Kyoto

104
00:05:29,945 --> 00:05:32,744
and eating people.

105
00:05:32,745 --> 00:05:36,644
That paper plant leaf was a magic seal a tengu used long ago

106
00:05:36,645 --> 00:05:38,744
to imprison the monsters.

107
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:39,745
While this is happening,

108
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:42,644
the tengu appears to Kuranosuke in his dreams.

109
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:46,344
The monsters fear the one who broke the seal

110
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,644
will come to imprison them again.

111
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:54,444
They are looking for her so that they may kill her.

112
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:59,244
If you hide the golden paper plant leaf in your wife's bosom

113
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:01,444
and allow the monsters to eat her,

114
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:04,344
they will be imprisoned once again.

115
00:06:04,345 --> 00:06:07,244
I won't do that even if it kills me!

116
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:10,344
I see. You're willing to risk your life.

117
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:11,944
Then take the paper plant leaf

118
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:14,544
and jump from the Kiyomizu butai.

119
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:17,845
The path will open to you.

120
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,444
Believing the Tengu's words,

121
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:23,444
Kuranosuke leaps from the Kiyomizu butai

122
00:06:23,445 --> 00:06:25,744
and becomes a golden tengu.

123
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:28,644
He saves Mana from the monsters just before they're about to eat her,

124
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:32,244
and defeats them using great magical powers.

125
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:34,744
But now that Kuranosuke is a tengu,

126
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:37,145
Mana can't see him anymore.

127
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:42,244
As Mana is crying over the sudden disappearance of her husband,

128
00:06:42,245 --> 00:06:45,644
she hears Kuranosuke's voice.

129
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:47,544
If you want to see me,

130
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:51,344
take a tengu's flower to the Kiyomizu butai at sunset

131
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:55,344
when the leaves are reddest.

132
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:59,344
Mana picks a speedwell

133
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:02,144
and goes to the Kiyomizu butai as she was told.

134
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:04,744
Kuranosuke appears before her as a tengu

135
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:07,744
and explains to Mana what happened.

136
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:10,344
But why did you tell me to come in the evening?

137
00:07:10,345 --> 00:07:12,344
If I'd come when the sun were higher,

138
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:15,444
we could've spent more time together.

139
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:19,144
My rage at the monsters turned my face red,

140
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:22,645
and my entire body is red with their blood.

141
00:07:23,745 --> 00:07:27,044
I thought if we were surrounded by red,

142
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:29,244
the color would hide it a little.

143
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:34,644
Answering her question, they exchange a farewell kiss,

144
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:37,045
and Kuranosuke disappears into the approaching darkness.

145
00:07:39,145 --> 00:07:41,944
It's a sad story.

146
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:43,144
Wow!

147
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:45,544
How do you know so much about it?

148
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:48,244
It hasn't come out yet, right?

149
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:53,144
Actually, this movie is a remake of a graduation project

150
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:56,544
they shot at Gion Art School.

151
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:59,844
"The Fighting Red Tengu" -The entire story's available online.

152
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:05,944
They became famous because of that graduation project,

153
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:11,845
so it's hard to imagine one of them was unhappy with it.

154
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:14,744
Come to think of it,

155
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,544
when we met Keiko at the Kiyomizu butai,

156
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:19,845
she released a pressed flower into the wind.

157
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:26,344
Maybe that was a speedwell like the one in the story.

158
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:28,544
-Is that true? -Yeah.

159
00:08:28,545 --> 00:08:30,344
I think she also said, "You just wait, Dekuri."

160
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:33,444
"It won't be long now."

161
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:35,844
What? Dekuri?

162
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:37,844
Who's Dekuri?

163
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:40,345
There wasn't anyone like that on the staff list.

164
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:55,745
Mana and Kuranosuke kissed at the Kiyomizu butai...

165
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:08,745
Does Shinichi want to kiss, too?

166
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:24,511
Okay, everyone.

167
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:28,011
This afternoon, you'll be free to go where you want with your groups.

168
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:31,211
Make sure you follow the course you planned with your group

169
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:34,011
and return to the hotel by six.

170
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:36,012
Okay...

171
00:09:37,012 --> 00:09:39,111
Have you heard, Kudo?

172
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,711
If you use a selfie stick at the hotel baths,

173
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:43,611
you can look into the women's baths.

174
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:45,911
-Seriously? -Seriously.

175
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:50,412
Sera's chest isn't much to look at,

176
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:55,011
but Ran's must be crazy.

177
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,612
Well, yeah.

178
00:09:57,812 --> 00:09:59,211
Well, yeah?

179
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:02,012
Not only have you kissed her, but you've also bathed together?

180
00:10:04,112 --> 00:10:05,811
Of course not.

181
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:08,511
Why did you hesitate? Come on, tell me!

182
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:11,311
I told you, I haven't!

183
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:13,211
Sometimes I do as Conan, though.

184
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,612
Spit it out. Tell me, and I'll forgive you.

185
00:10:17,512 --> 00:10:20,912
Come on. Confess already.

186
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:23,811
-Come on. -Time out.

187
00:10:23,812 --> 00:10:25,512
Someone's calling me.

188
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:28,611
Hattori?

189
00:10:28,612 --> 00:10:31,411
-Sorry, I gotta take this. -Sure.

190
00:10:31,412 --> 00:10:33,311
Hello, Hattori?

191
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:35,511
Did something happen again?

192
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:37,111
It's not looking good.

193
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:39,111
The media's gathered in front of the hotel.

194
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:41,511
They're making a huge fuss.

195
00:10:41,512 --> 00:10:43,411
It can't be helped

196
00:10:43,412 --> 00:10:47,211
since Naomoto Award winner Taro Nishiki died last night,

197
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:50,711
but will you be okay with all this going on?

198
00:10:50,712 --> 00:10:52,711
Your teachers might cancel the trip

199
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:55,511
and take you guys back to Tokyo.

200
00:10:55,512 --> 00:10:58,411
Oh, yeah. We're fine for now.

201
00:10:58,412 --> 00:11:02,711
The teachers seem to be avoiding mentioning the case,

202
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:05,011
and the rooms we're staying in

203
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:09,411
are pretty far away from the room Nishiki died in.

204
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:11,311
Anyway, think you can slip away?

205
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:12,312
What?

206
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:14,911
Those four want to tell us about

207
00:11:14,912 --> 00:11:18,111
that Dekuri guy who came up with the cipher.

208
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:20,911
It's hard for them to talk here with the media around,

209
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:23,111
so they want to secretly meet for lunch

210
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:26,011
at a restaurant where they have a reservation.

211
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:28,811
I'm going with the police.

212
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:31,311
You'll want to speak with them in person, right?

213
00:11:31,312 --> 00:11:32,911
What's the restaurant?

214
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:35,811
Hey, where should we get lunch?

215
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:38,111
Yesterday's fruit sandwiches were good.

216
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:39,511
I want beef.

217
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:41,411
Then today...

218
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:42,611
Hey.

219
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:45,911
How about a place called Isogiyama in Ponto City?

220
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:46,912
"Ponto City"

221
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:48,711
Way to go, Sonoko.

222
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:51,911
At first, they said they were booked solid.

223
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,311
The Suzuki Conglomerate sure is great.

224
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:56,511
Well, yeah.

225
00:11:56,512 --> 00:12:00,511
What's this round barrier made of bamboo?

226
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,711
There are similar ones in front of the other shops, too.

227
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:06,411
Maybe it's a fad in Kyoto.

228
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:07,811
That can't be right.

229
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:10,511
It's an inuyarai.

230
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:15,811
They say they're to deter thieves or mark the edges of the street,

231
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:19,011
but they're apparently for deterring dogs from urinating.

232
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:21,211
-Momiji. -You know her?

233
00:12:21,212 --> 00:12:24,911
Yeah. We met last time I came to Kyoto with my dad.

234
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,211
Her tits are huge.

235
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:29,111
Are they your friends?

236
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:31,511
You're wearing the same uniforms.

237
00:12:31,512 --> 00:12:35,611
Yes. We came from Tokyo on a school trip.

238
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:38,711
I see. From Tokyo?

239
00:12:38,712 --> 00:12:43,211
Thank you for coming all the way from the provinces.

240
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:44,811
The provinces?

241
00:12:44,812 --> 00:12:47,311
But we're from the capital.

242
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:50,811
What do you have to eat to get that big?

243
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,811
My high school's off this afternoon.

244
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:57,511
I was thinking about having lunch here.

245
00:12:57,512 --> 00:12:59,411
Shall we eat together?

246
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:04,311
Oh, right. Momiji, you attend Kyoto Senshin High School, right?

247
00:13:04,312 --> 00:13:06,111
Yes, I do.

248
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:09,411
Do you know Soshi Okita?

249
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:14,411
Oh, yes. That kendo brat is in my class.

250
00:13:14,412 --> 00:13:15,911
Really?

251
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:18,611
Let's not stand around out here.

252
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:20,611
Why don't we talk inside?

253
00:13:20,612 --> 00:13:21,911
Okay.

254
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:24,011
Tengu!

255
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:27,011
There are tengu on Kiyamachi Way!

256
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:28,111
Tengu!

257
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:29,912
-Tengu? -Really?

258
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:42,211
Hey...

259
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:43,912
Just how many are there?

260
00:13:46,012 --> 00:13:47,411
Inspector Ayanokoji.

261
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:49,211
What's all this noise?

262
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:50,611
Sorry, sir.

263
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:55,211
People are saying tengu have appeared on Kiyamachi Way.

264
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:58,111
Kiyamachi Way? That's just around the corner.

265
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:02,111
Do something about those idiots yourselves.

266
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:06,911
But, Inspector, it's not just a couple of tengu.

267
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,311
What?

268
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:10,611
Do those tengu...

269
00:14:10,612 --> 00:14:13,211
Have something to do with Nishiki's case?

270
00:14:13,212 --> 00:14:16,111
Hey! You'll protect us, right?

271
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:17,711
Fine, then.

272
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:20,511
We have to step away for a moment.

273
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:22,611
Please don't go anywhere.

274
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,211
Okay.

275
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:26,511
I'm scared.

276
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:28,911
Don't let them escape.

277
00:14:28,912 --> 00:14:30,712
We've got this.

278
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,711
What should we do, Kudo?

279
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:44,311
Start catching them!

280
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:46,311
Got it.

281
00:14:46,312 --> 00:14:48,711
Ran, let's help them!

282
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:49,712
Okay.

283
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:52,812
Hey, wait! Don't leave me behind!

284
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,811
Iori.

285
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:16,111
Miss.

286
00:15:16,112 --> 00:15:17,511
Iori!

287
00:15:17,512 --> 00:15:19,711
Miss, are you hurt?

288
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,911
I'm all right.

289
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:23,911
-Who's that? -Who are you actually?

290
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:26,211
Gosh. I got caught.

291
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:27,711
Heiji!

292
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:31,411
What are you wearing these weird masks for?

293
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:33,911
They were recruiting online.

294
00:15:33,912 --> 00:15:37,211
100 thousand yen up front just for wearing a tengu mask

295
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:39,011
and running around Kiyamachi Way.

296
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:41,011
If you don't get caught for thirty minutes,

297
00:15:41,012 --> 00:15:42,911
they said they'd pay a million.

298
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:44,511
Is that true?

299
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:46,211
Hattori!

300
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:49,011
Hattori, is it just those four in the restaurant right now?

301
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:51,512
Yeah. We'd better head back soon.

302
00:15:56,912 --> 00:15:59,212
-Darn it. -They got us.

303
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:05,311
It's the actor Ihaya this time.

304
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:08,511
Yeah. Sliced his carotid artery right open.

305
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:11,911
He's upside down with two bumps on his head again.

306
00:16:11,912 --> 00:16:14,511
What a strange culprit.

307
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:17,711
They must've taken the time to make these marks

308
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:21,211
before inviting him out here to kill him.

309
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:22,411
No.

310
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:25,112
When we left ten minutes ago...

311
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:28,512
these marks weren't here.

"Next Episode" -The blood spray and footprints on the inuyarai...

Are we being tricked by a fox?

314
00:18:27,812 --> 00:18:29,611
Huh?

315
00:18:29,612 --> 00:18:32,811
There are weird marks around the inuyarai.

316
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,711
Did he just say "Huh"?

317
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:39,211
I don't have time to think about that right now.

318
00:18:39,212 --> 00:18:40,512
Time?
