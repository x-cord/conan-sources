1
00:00:01,508 --> 00:00:02,807
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,808 --> 00:00:04,707
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,708 --> 00:00:06,308
A fantastic deduction that astonishes

4
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:07,607
monster police officer, younger brother of Yokomizo.

5
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,107
The Youth Detective Squad is all out to get!

6
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:10,407
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,408 --> 00:00:12,107
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:14,408
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:59,316
We came clam digging along with Dr. Agasa.

10
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:02,700
We coincidentally run into university students of the Clam Devotees Club

11
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:05,301
who have come to dig clams and get acquainted.

12
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:10,900
However, one of them, Mr. Tsuguo Ushigome

13
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:13,901
dies of cyanide poisoning!

14
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,000
From the circumstances at the scene,

15
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:19,001
the possibility of suicide is most likely, however...

16
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:23,100
But, isn't that strange?

17
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,100
There's blood on the rim of the bottle where you drink from

18
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:28,300
but there's nothing on the cap.

19
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:31,700
Ushigome hurt his finger.

20
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:33,000
Hurt?

21
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:35,500
If so, maybe he cut his finger with a cracked shell or something

22
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:37,800
when he was digging clams.

23
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:41,401
I think he was digging clams with thinking of something, so...

24
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:44,301
I see.

25
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:48,300
It's true that he has a cut on the index finger of his right hand.

26
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,300
Although the blood looks dry.

27
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:54,100
In other words, when he first opened the cap,

28
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:57,800
his wound wasn't closed up yet and the cap was stained with blood.

29
00:02:57,801 --> 00:03:01,200
But, when he brought the bottle here and opened it again,

30
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:03,200
he noticed the blood on it

31
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:07,001
so he wiped off the blood first and then opened it again.

32
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:20,801
"Clam Digging-Sigh (Part 2)"

33
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:33,300
Genta, please don't eat candy here!

34
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:34,501
Want a bite?

35
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:37,100
He opened them all!

36
00:03:37,101 --> 00:03:39,500
I mean how long are you going to make us wait,

37
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:41,001
younger brother of Yokomizo?

38
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:46,300
Yes, Yokomizo.

39
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:49,400
Oh, hello, and how did the results come out?

40
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:51,501
I guess they got the results.

41
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:55,501
-Let's go see! -Okay!

42
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:58,701
Hey, wait!

43
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:01,200
Let's see...

44
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:03,800
Which one...

45
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:06,301
What should I do?

46
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:12,300
According to the report by the forensic officer,

47
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:15,700
the poison that was inside the green tea was cyanide.

48
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:19,300
Poison was also detected on the cap of the bottle.

49
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,300
Taking into consideration that the contents of the glass bottle

50
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:24,500
that was found in the car was also cyanide...

51
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:28,200
it's probably safe to conclude that Mr. Ushigome committed suicide.

52
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,400
Is that so?

53
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:32,600
By the way, whose car is this?

54
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:34,900
A rental car that Ushigome rented.

55
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:39,300
He always drives when we come clam digging.

56
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:41,900
Which means you come to this beach frequently?

57
00:04:41,901 --> 00:04:44,200
No, this is our first time here.

58
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,500
We were actually planning to come here last week but...

59
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,000
But?

60
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:51,000
It became inconvenient for us

61
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,500
so we postponed it to this week!

62
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,600
Well, we'll get to the details at the station.

63
00:04:55,601 --> 00:05:00,700
Was blood found on the cap of the bottle?

64
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,800
Yes, although just slightly, there seems to have blood on it,

65
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:06,300
together with Mr. Ushigome's fingerprints.

66
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:07,900
Just slightly?

67
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:10,700
When he first opened the bottle,

68
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:14,801
his wound probably didn't touch his wound much.

69
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:19,800
So! Now that you know, go on home, kids!

70
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:21,600
Suicide.

71
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,601
Is it really suicide?

72
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:27,300
It's true that since Mr. Ushigome opened the cap of the bottle of green tea

73
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:32,500
and started drinking it, nobody touched it.

74
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:37,500
Mr. Ushigome himself brought the PET bottle here.

75
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:41,700
So, there was no chance for anyone to put poison in his drink.

76
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:45,300
But, something bothers me. That person's remark.

77
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:47,200
Why did that person say that back then?

78
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:50,500
What's with you? You look funny.

79
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:54,700
It can't be helped! Both my hands were tied!

80
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,300
Then, why don't you wrapped the chocolate in the foil

81
00:05:57,301 --> 00:06:00,200
and put the snacks together into the bag?

82
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:04,801
I hate to let go of food that I got a hold of once!

83
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:14,001
You all had a trash bag, didn't you?

84
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:16,100
Yeah.

85
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:17,700
Yes.

86
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:20,100
You gotta go to the police from here, right?

87
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:22,200
Would you like me to throw the trash away for you?

88
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:23,500
Okay.

89
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:26,500
But there are food and drinks that we ate and drank in the car too,

90
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:28,601
so there's quite a lot of trash.

91
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:31,600
These are for recycling PET bottles.

92
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:33,400
This is for combustible trash.

93
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:36,301
And, this is for non-combustible trash.

94
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:39,001
Thanks, then!

95
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:41,601
-Yep! -Oh, Conan!

96
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:45,401
What's all that?

97
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:50,101
Just what's on your mind, bringing all this trash along with you?

98
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:55,901
Hey!

99
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:03,200
They were all separated nicely and yet...

100
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,800
Are you going to make something?

101
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:08,001
What are you going to make with the PET bottle?

102
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:15,900
I see. So, that's the story.

103
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:18,400
My, that grinning triumphant look of yours,

104
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:20,500
means that you've figured something out, doesn't it?

105
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:23,700
Yeah. It wasn't suicide!

106
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:24,900
Really?

107
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:26,600
Then, who's the culprit?

108
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:28,100
Before I tell you,

109
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:31,601
I'd like you guys to help me out with something.

110
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:33,900
What is it?

111
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:36,301
A bit of clam digging!

112
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:40,000
Conan, if you already figured out who the culprit is,

113
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,900
why do we have to dig clams?

114
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:46,500
Besides, since we're so far away from the edge of the water,

115
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:49,400
I don't think there are any clams here.

116
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:54,800
This is the place where the students had their mats out.

117
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:58,700
Yes. The trash has all been cleared away, much less the clams,

118
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:00,700
and there's nothing left.

119
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:04,501
So, what we're looking for are not clams but PET bottle...

120
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:12,600
I found one! I found the cap of a PET bottle!

121
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:14,400
Don't touch it, Ayumi!

122
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:15,600
Okay!

123
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:18,300
Green tea is written on it, isn't it?

124
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:20,400
If I remember correctly, the drink that the man named Ushigome

125
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:22,900
was drinking was green tea, right?

126
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:26,201
What's more, isn't that blood on the cap?

127
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:28,101
See.

128
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:32,300
Although it's blackish, that's probably blood.

129
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:34,700
Then, don't tell me that the cap is...

130
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:38,301
Yeah. This will clear everything.

131
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:45,000
That Mr. Ushigome didn't commit suicide, but was killed.

132
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:48,700
As well as by who!

133
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:50,900
Okay, we'll question them at the station

134
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:52,900
so take the three by police car and...

135
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,600
Hey!

136
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,100
Younger brother!

137
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:59,101
Please wait!

138
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:01,700
Wait.

139
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:05,700
Will you hear me out before you take those three with you?

140
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,000
Hear you out?

141
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:08,600
We've figured it out.

142
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:10,900
Figured what out?

143
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:15,101
The one who killed Mr. Ushigome!

144
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:21,000
And, that killer is among the three people

145
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:23,501
who came clam digging with Mr. Ushigome too!

146
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:25,026
What?

147
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:38,522
Hey, hey, just what are you getting at?

148
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:41,446
This is suicide, suicide!

149
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:46,446
Mr. Ushigome came back alone to this car that was parked here.

150
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:50,746
And, when the three here returned from the beach after cleaning up,

151
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:52,646
he was dead, you know.

152
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:55,546
Moreover, the green tea bottle with the cyanide that poisoned him

153
00:09:55,547 --> 00:09:57,646
was found on the ground beside him,

154
00:09:57,647 --> 00:10:01,446
and at his feet, the glass bottle that had cyanide inside it was found.

155
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:03,846
Taking into consideration that.

156
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:07,446
Mr. Ushigome was drinking the tea without problem,

157
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:10,146
the only thing thinkable is that

158
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:13,946
he came back here poured the poison into his drink and drank it, right?

159
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,646
But, Mr. Ushigome is not the one

160
00:10:16,647 --> 00:10:19,047
who went to buy the bottle of green tea, right?

161
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:21,046
No.

162
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:24,247
These went to buy it.

163
00:10:24,947 --> 00:10:28,946
Ms. Yashima handed the bottle of green tea to him.

164
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:32,346
Mr. Mitsuse threw the rice balls to him.

165
00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:34,746
And Ms. Hisatsu just opened the package of snacks

166
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:37,046
and put it beside him...

167
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:40,146
After Mr. Ushigome opened the cap of his bottle of green tea,

168
00:10:40,147 --> 00:10:43,346
none of the three touched it.

169
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:44,946
And even after that.

170
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:48,846
Mr. Ushigome held the bottle himself right through, isn't that right?

171
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:52,746
Just when and how could somebody have inserted the poison?

172
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:55,246
Haven't you forgotten something?

173
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:56,247
Forgotten something?

174
00:10:56,248 --> 00:11:01,246
Well, "something" always comes with the PET bottle, doesn't it?

175
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,547
Things that come with PET bottles are...

176
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:10,247
The labels with the product names on them.

177
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:14,146
Just what are you talking about, younger brother?

178
00:11:14,147 --> 00:11:16,246
The cap, the cap of the bottle!

179
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:20,846
If poison is smeared onto the inside of the cap...

180
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,046
All you have to do is switch the cap to one with poison on it,

181
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:26,346
and you don't even have to touch the bottle...

182
00:11:26,347 --> 00:11:28,546
To simply mix the poison into the drink!

183
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:30,946
I see, great deduction...

184
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:33,346
is what I'd like to say.

185
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:35,547
But, that's not possible, brats.

186
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:40,846
If the bottle was filled to the top with green tea, then, maybe...

187
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:45,846
But, Mr. Ushigome seems to have removed the cap and gulped tea down!

188
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:50,146
If so, even if the cap were changed to one with poison on it,

189
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:54,046
the poison on the closed cap wouldn't have reached the green tea at all.

190
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:58,746
However, suppose that you apply it on the spiral part inside the cap?

191
00:11:58,747 --> 00:12:02,846
I see! Then the poison will go on to the mouth of the bottle

192
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,746
when he puts the cap back on.

193
00:12:04,747 --> 00:12:07,146
Yeah, if so then it's most likely that when he drinks tea,

194
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:09,146
his mouth would touch that part,

195
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:10,946
but the cyanide in question,

196
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:15,646
fatal enough to kill was detected inside the PET bottle of green tea.

197
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:18,746
If only the mouth of the bottle had poison on it,

198
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:22,446
then there wouldn't be much poison found in the drink itself!

199
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:24,646
True.

200
00:12:24,647 --> 00:12:28,246
Well, in order to mix the poison that is on the cap into the drink,

201
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,746
you'd have to turn the bottle upside down

202
00:12:30,747 --> 00:12:33,546
and shake it vigorously to mix the poison with the tea.

203
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:36,646
Did Mr. Ushigome have a habit of doing something like that?

204
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:39,046
-No. -He did shake the container

205
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:40,546
if it was tomato juice or something.

206
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:42,346
Maybe he placed it sideways?

207
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:43,946
Sideways?

208
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:45,746
If I remember correctly, Mr. Ushigome

209
00:12:45,747 --> 00:12:48,946
returned to the car holding two buckets, right?

210
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:51,646
Yeah, that's right.

211
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,446
-Hey. -Why did Mr. Ushigome

212
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:54,946
have to take the buckets to the car

213
00:12:54,947 --> 00:12:57,346
all by himself without anybody helping him?

214
00:12:57,347 --> 00:13:01,346
Ushigome was most knowledgeable about clams.

215
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,846
He was always in charge of digging clams

216
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:06,546
and making them spit out sand.

217
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:09,346
We were the ones who did the cooking, though.

218
00:13:09,347 --> 00:13:12,546
-Hey. -Did you always have just two buckets?

219
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:15,546
Yes, just about always.

220
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:18,046
Who cares about the number of buckets?

221
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,746
Figure out why the bottle was placed sideways!

222
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:24,046
Well, Mr. Ushigome was holding two buckets

223
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:26,946
and both his hands were full.

224
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:27,947
So?

225
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:30,746
If so, he'd either put the bottle in the bucket

226
00:13:30,747 --> 00:13:32,246
or hold it under his arm,

227
00:13:32,247 --> 00:13:35,847
or have no other choice than to put the bottle sideways...

228
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:40,446
into the pocket of the parkas that you're all wearing, right?

229
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:41,646
Now that you mentioned it,

230
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:46,847
Mr. Ushigome had the bottle placed sideways as you just said.

231
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:50,446
I see. If he places it sideways,

232
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:53,046
then when he walks the green tea inside would be shaken

233
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:55,046
and by the time he gets to the parking lot,

234
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:57,746
the poison that is smeared onto the inside of the cap of the bottle

235
00:13:57,747 --> 00:14:00,546
would be sufficiently mixed!

236
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:02,546
Yeah, that's exactly right.

237
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:04,746
But this worked out

238
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:09,246
because he just happened to be wearing a parka with a pocket.

239
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:12,546
I don't think it was a coincident!

240
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:14,746
The parkas that they are wearing

241
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:18,546
are parkas that were made exclusively for the Clam Devotees Club.

242
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:20,446
Moreover, it seems to have been made just recently.

243
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:23,746
So, if everyone decides to wear it when coming to dig for clams today,

244
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:26,146
I'm sure Mr. Ushigome would have worn it too, don't you?

245
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:29,746
And if Mr. Ushigome always carried two buckets

246
00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:32,446
and returned to the car alone...

247
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,846
It is more or less predictable that

248
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:38,846
he would put the bottle sideways in the pocket of his parka.

249
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:42,746
It's true that the poison would most likely be mixed if so, but...

250
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:43,747
The question is,

251
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:47,246
who switched the cap to the one with poison on it, and how.

252
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:49,146
When you remove the cap,

253
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:51,747
you usually place it near yourself, don't you?

254
00:14:52,947 --> 00:14:54,646
True.

255
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:57,746
I think that Mr. Ushigome also put it

256
00:14:57,747 --> 00:15:00,546
somewhere on the mat he was sitting on.

257
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:01,547
Which means that.

258
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:08,346
Ms. Yashima only handed the bottle over to him by hand.

259
00:15:08,347 --> 00:15:11,946
She couldn't have switched the cap.

260
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:15,746
That means that Mr. Mitsuse couldn't have done it either

261
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:19,247
because all he did was throw the rice balls to him.

262
00:15:19,547 --> 00:15:23,146
If he were to stretch over and try to switch the cap of the bottle,

263
00:15:23,147 --> 00:15:25,146
it would be obvious...

264
00:15:25,147 --> 00:15:29,046
Which means the only one remaining would be the one

265
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:30,746
who placed the bag of potato chips near Mr. Ushigome.

266
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:33,746
Ms. Hisatsu, it seems that you could've switched the caps

267
00:15:33,747 --> 00:15:36,146
that were on the mat that you were sitting on.

268
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:38,247
Oh, no.

269
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:41,746
Hey, just what do you think you're saying?

270
00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:44,246
How could she if all she did was to put down a bag of chips?

271
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:48,147
The bag of potato chips would've served as a great blinder.

272
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:56,846
Ms. Hisatsu put the bag of potato chips right beside Mr. Ushigome.

273
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:59,946
She had the poisoned cap pinched between her fingers beforehand.

274
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:01,746
She hides it with the bag of potato chips and switches the cap.

275
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:04,546
Then, Mr. Ushigome would think that the cap beside him

276
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,346
is the one he put there.

277
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:11,146
There was blood on the mouth of the PET bottle but none on the cap

278
00:16:11,147 --> 00:16:13,846
because he touched the poisoned cap only after it had been switched

279
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,047
and the cut of his finger had dried up.

280
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:19,646
Well, even if his cut were to be dried,

281
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:22,246
blood was also detected from the poisoned cap

282
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:26,246
because his finger touched the cap each time he opened and closed the cap.

283
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:28,846
That's what you're getting at, right, kid?

284
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:29,946
Yep!

285
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,746
Right, Doc?

286
00:16:31,747 --> 00:16:33,846
Yeah.

287
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:39,046
Which means the cap with Ushigome's blood on it should be somewhere.

288
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:41,446
If I remember correctly, you all had trash bags, didn't you?

289
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:44,947
Oh, well... we handed the bags over to the kid wearing glasses.

290
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,646
Hey, hey, don't tell me you checked the cap?

291
00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:54,846
Yep! Although there were six PET bottles, there were only five caps!

292
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,546
Only the cap for the empty green tea bottle was gone!

293
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:00,946
So, in other words,

294
00:17:00,947 --> 00:17:03,846
the culprit had a bottle of green tea beforehand,

295
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:06,046
and made Mr. Ushigome drink all the tea in it,

296
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,446
after which she kept the cap.

297
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:10,546
She inserted poison in the bottle somewhere,

298
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:14,246
and switched the cap of that bottle to the one with poison on it.

299
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:15,946
After a while, taking time into consideration,

300
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:17,846
if she urges everyone to head home,

301
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:22,546
Mr. Ushigome who returns to the car drinks the poisoned green tea.

302
00:17:22,547 --> 00:17:25,746
If the glass bottle that was left on the floor of the car beforehand

303
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:27,646
is found later by the police,

304
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,246
it would look as if he committed suicide!

305
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:33,846
That glass bottle was most likely one that the killer

306
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:38,446
got hold of from Mr. Ushigome and used, to set the scene for suicide.

307
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:42,747
But when the cap was switched, her calculations went wrong.

308
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:49,246
Mr. Ushigome's blood was on the cap.

309
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:52,546
That's why you didn't put it in the trash bag, right?

310
00:17:52,547 --> 00:17:53,846
Because if the cap is found,

311
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:57,746
the fact that you switched the caps would be disclosed.

312
00:17:57,747 --> 00:18:01,246
Well, you probably disposed of the cap somewhere.

313
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,146
But, if we check the beach around the area where you were...

314
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:05,547
We thought so too and searched for it.

315
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:08,146
See!

316
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:10,346
The blood stained cap of the green tea bottle!

317
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:11,947
Kid!

318
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:26,146
But is that going to serve as proof?

319
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,846
Her fingerprints would already be on the cap

320
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:30,446
when she bought it at the convenience store!

321
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:32,647
No... not the fingerprints.

322
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:36,646
If she touched the cap,

323
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:39,346
it should be detected from Ms. Hisatsu's finger too.

324
00:18:39,347 --> 00:18:42,646
The luminol reaction, that is also the evidence

325
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:45,146
that she touched Mr. Ushigome's blood.

326
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:46,246
Hey, Shoko!

327
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:48,546
Are you going to stand for him talking about you like that?

328
00:18:48,547 --> 00:18:50,246
Tell him he's wrong!

329
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:52,547
Tell him to go ahead and investigate if he wants to!

330
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:55,947
He's not wrong.

331
00:18:56,747 --> 00:19:00,446
What the officer is saying is all true.

332
00:19:00,447 --> 00:19:03,046
-Huh? -Hey, don't tell me that it's about that accident...

333
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:04,247
Accident?

334
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:07,746
Hey, what accident are you talking about?

335
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,146
Remember, the other day?

336
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:12,846
There was a hit-and-run accident near here.

337
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:15,046
Maybe it has something to do with that?

338
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:18,746
They all looked tense when that accident was mentioned.

339
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:20,447
A hit-and-run accident?

340
00:19:21,547 --> 00:19:24,046
You mean the accident where a drunkard was run over...

341
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:25,846
Don't tell me that you guys are involved?

342
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:29,046
We didn't know about it until we read the papers the following day!

343
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:30,846
-Besides... -Hey!

344
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:32,947
Besides, what?

345
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:38,746
Besides, Ushigome said it felt like he hit somebody

346
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:41,146
so we stopped the car right away and all went to check,

347
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,546
but there was no one there.

348
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:44,547
-There was. -Huh?

349
00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:47,647
There was someone there, back then.

350
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:52,146
In the grassy area that I checked.

351
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:55,046
There was a blood smeared man lying on the ground.

352
00:19:55,047 --> 00:19:57,246
Why didn't you tell us about it?

353
00:19:57,247 --> 00:19:58,446
I couldn't say anything!

354
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:03,046
Because the man was already dead and Ushigome was drinking too.

355
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:05,146
If this came out to the light, the job that I finally got

356
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:06,846
would go down the drain too.

357
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:10,646
Right, as long as Ushigome kept his mouth shut.

358
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:13,747
If he only didn't say, "I'm going to turn myself in."

359
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,646
Just like clams.

360
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,946
No matter how well you think something is hidden,

361
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:23,546
the traces of it is somewhere for sure.

362
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:25,846
The more you try to hide something, the more obvious it becomes,

363
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:28,346
quite difficult to handle.

364
00:20:28,347 --> 00:20:30,046
Even if Mr. Ushigome didn't confess,

365
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:32,746
we the police would've got to him eventually.

366
00:20:32,747 --> 00:20:37,647
We would've found that rotten hole in your heart either way!

367
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:20,446
We've finally finished cleaning up.

368
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:23,646
We couldn't leave just like that so...

369
00:22:23,647 --> 00:22:26,446
But, to think that you figured out who the killer was

370
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:29,746
just by seeing her put the bag of potato chips near the victim.

371
00:22:29,747 --> 00:22:32,346
That's not all!

372
00:22:32,347 --> 00:22:35,746
When blood was found on the mouth of the PET bottle,

373
00:22:35,747 --> 00:22:40,946
she mentioned Mr. Ushigome hurting his finger.

374
00:22:40,947 --> 00:22:43,246
How does that connect?

375
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:46,746
I knew that Mr. Ushigome had an injured finger.

376
00:22:46,747 --> 00:22:49,846
But if blood is found on the mouth of the bottle,

377
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:52,146
most people would think that

378
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:55,346
the person cut his lips or inside his mouth, right?

379
00:22:55,347 --> 00:23:00,046
No blood was found on the cap that was on the floor near Mr. Ushigome.

380
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:02,146
That's how I figured it out!

381
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,846
I thought that Ms. Hisatsu said that

382
00:23:03,847 --> 00:23:08,747
because she saw the blood smeared cap when she switched caps.

383
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:14,246
Isn't it just like you said, Doc?

384
00:23:14,247 --> 00:23:15,247
Huh?

385
00:23:15,248 --> 00:23:17,746
Yeah, that's right.

386
00:23:17,747 --> 00:23:19,246
Oh, right,

387
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:21,946
I'll have you come to the station later too,

388
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:24,346
so bring the brats and...

389
00:23:24,347 --> 00:23:26,646
Where are the others?

390
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:28,746
Huh? True.

391
00:23:28,747 --> 00:23:33,446
They all went rushing back to the beach a while ago,

392
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:35,947
saying they lost something important.

393
00:23:37,847 --> 00:23:42,346
It was a Yaiba doll that I've never seen before.

394
00:23:42,347 --> 00:23:45,746
Don't you remember where you dropped it?

395
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:48,646
If I remember, I'd find it right away!

396
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:51,146
It was a super rare doll.

397
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:54,347
We gotta buy whole lot to get a hold of it again, you know.

398
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:58,847
You guys really like clam digging, don't you?

399
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:01,447
A code?

400
00:24:02,747 --> 00:24:04,946
In the first part of Speckled (tri-colored) Cat Holmes,

401
00:24:04,947 --> 00:24:07,446
the cat was on someone's shoulder!

402
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,346
Which means if a Russian Blue is trained,

403
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,947
it can ride on a shoulder too, right?

404
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:19,246
See you later, Goro.

405
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:21,147
Take care of Pops, okay?

406
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:25,146
Next Conan,

407
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:29,347
"Secret of the Russian Blue."

408
00:24:45,047 --> 00:24:47,246
Next Conan's Hint:

409
00:24:47,247 --> 00:24:49,546
"Girlish writing."

410
00:24:49,547 --> 00:24:52,647
There are no girlish girls on Detective Conan's cast.
