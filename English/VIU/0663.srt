1
00:00:07,313 --> 00:00:10,313
Cool! Let me touch it too.

2
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:12,713
It's so thorny. I guess it hurts.

3
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:15,013
Dad got it for me at the department store!

4
00:00:15,013 --> 00:00:20,013
I've got a stag beetle at home too! -How lucky.

5
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:23,213
It's meaningless if you don't go and catch them yourself!

6
00:00:23,213 --> 00:00:26,213
But, I'd like to have a beetle too.

7
00:00:26,213 --> 00:00:27,413
Yeah.

8
00:00:28,813 --> 00:00:30,513
Beetle?

9
00:00:30,513 --> 00:00:32,913
So that's what you want?

10
00:00:32,913 --> 00:00:34,913
You're a kid after all.

11
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:39,013
You can catch as many beetles as you want.

12
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:40,613
Really?

13
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:43,013
You're gonna get it if it's a lie!

14
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:47,413
Yeah, an old friend of mine lives in Yamanashi, you see.

15
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:51,113
He's been asking me to go and see him.

16
00:00:51,113 --> 00:00:54,513
If we go there, you can catch as many beetles as you like.

17
00:00:54,513 --> 00:01:00,913
And so, we decided to go visit Doc's old friend.

18
00:01:00,913 --> 00:01:03,813
Talk about going into the mountains.

19
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:07,413
For sure, we'll be able to catch lots of beetles and stag beetles here!

20
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:09,613
Absolutely!

21
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:13,813
Maybe we'll even find a Giant Hercules Beetle!

22
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:15,713
Wow!

23
00:01:15,713 --> 00:01:18,013
No, we won't.

24
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,713
If all cases were men,

25
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:40,413
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

26
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:42,613
Beetles, stag beetles and Buddhist statues?

27
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:44,113
The detective squad goes on an all out investigation.

28
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:45,713
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:47,513
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:47,513 --> 00:01:49,913
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:18,244
"Pursue the Miyama Stag Beetle"

32
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:31,127
He said he'd come to pick us up, but...

33
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,627
There isn't even a convenience store in sight.

34
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:36,427
There aren't any vending machines either.

35
00:03:36,427 --> 00:03:38,427
Agasa.

36
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,227
Ryutaro, long time no see!

37
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:42,927
How are you doing?

38
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:45,427
I'm doing just great!

39
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:46,827
Let me introduce.

40
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,627
He's my friend, Ryutaro Namatame.

41
00:03:49,627 --> 00:03:51,927
"Ryutaro Namatame (52)" -Thanks for coming all the way here, kids.

42
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:53,527
Welcome.

43
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:55,927
-We'll be in your care! -We'll be in your care!

44
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:59,327
You said that your house is located at the foot of the mountain.

45
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:01,127
Is it far from here?

46
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:04,927
No, it's just about an hour from here by car.

47
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:07,627
Well, I'm dying of thirst.

48
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:10,327
Can I get something to drink?

49
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:12,927
What a nuisance of a brat.

50
00:04:12,927 --> 00:04:14,027
Follow me.

51
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,527
"Roadside Resting Place"

52
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:24,127
I'll have coke.

53
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:26,427
I want a large serving of soft ice cream cone!

54
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:29,127
I'll have... What should I have?

55
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:32,727
Hey, Kei!

56
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:36,627
Seeing that you're having lunch here,

57
00:04:36,627 --> 00:04:38,127
it must mean that you went to play pachinko again.

58
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:39,827
No... No way!

59
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:42,227
"Kei Yabe (27)" -Geez, how rude!

60
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:43,627
I brought some watermelons

61
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:46,627
that I grew here to the direct sales store.

62
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:48,327
I doubt that.

63
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:49,827
Don't you ever get into debt again

64
00:04:49,827 --> 00:04:52,327
and make your mother suffer again.

65
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:54,327
I know.

66
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,327
It's a beetle. How large!

67
00:04:57,327 --> 00:05:00,627
There's a Miyama stag beetle too. Awesome!

68
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:02,427
Hey!

69
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,027
That's not for sale. Don't touch it!

70
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:07,927
"Shuhei Ikeda (50)" -Someone from a department store in Tokyo

71
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:09,427
is going to come to purchase them.

72
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:11,727
I can't sell them if they become weak!

73
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:15,327
Shuhei, they were just looking at the beetles.

74
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:17,227
Why all the fuss?

75
00:05:17,227 --> 00:05:19,927
Ryutaro, are they your acquaintances?

76
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:23,927
Yeah, they're my guests from Tokyo.

77
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:25,627
Don't go into our mountains

78
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:28,227
just because you want beetles now.

79
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:32,527
What a warm welcome after we just got here.

80
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:35,227
Oh, my! How cute!

81
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:36,927
Sorry about that.

82
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:39,027
Shuhei's always been stingy and suspicious of others

83
00:05:39,027 --> 00:05:40,927
ever since he was a child.

84
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:45,527
Moreover, we're having issues regarding the border of the land we own.

85
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:47,627
You're having issues regarding the land?

86
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:50,527
Does that mean you're rich, sir?

87
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:52,127
Don't be silly.

88
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:55,027
Well, since I own a farm, I won't starve,

89
00:05:55,027 --> 00:05:56,727
but I have no money at all.

90
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:59,827
But, we can all sleep over here, can't we?

91
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:04,127
Although it's an old house, there are many rooms, so don't worry.

92
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:07,827
Well, there are also a lot of old junk.

93
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:09,727
The antique shop dealer that came the other day

94
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:12,127
said that the statue of Buddha that I put on the alcove

95
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:15,427
was something from the Kamakura era.

96
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:17,427
I'll take this!

97
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:20,227
Okay, thank you very much!

98
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:31,427
This picture is sort of frightening.

99
00:06:31,427 --> 00:06:34,327
As expected of ignorant children.

100
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,327
It could be a piece drawn by Okyo Maruyama, you know.

101
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:41,127
And that statue of Buddha may have been made by Unkei.

102
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:44,527
It can't be...

103
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:48,127
Never mind that. Let's hurry and go!

104
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:49,527
Yeah!

105
00:06:49,527 --> 00:06:51,527
I have to catch a stag beetle no matter what

106
00:06:51,527 --> 00:06:53,927
and brag about it to everybody in class!

107
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:54,927
Yeah!

108
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:02,727
Shall we start around here?

109
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:04,527
Are the beetles here?

110
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:07,327
I'm not sure, but beetles and stag beetles

111
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:10,927
like to hang around oak trees like these.

112
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:12,127
It stinks of liquor.

113
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,627
Did you put the banana we got and soaked it in this?

114
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:18,127
Never mind that. Just spread the stocking, will you?

115
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:19,727
Yes, sure.

116
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:23,127
Since you told me to bring some old stockings,

117
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:25,027
I was wondering what you were going to use it for.

118
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,727
I guess this was it.

119
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:30,727
Dad asked me if I was going to play cops and robbers.

120
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:33,927
Are you sure we can catch them with something like this?

121
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:35,927
We'll find out at night.

122
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:37,227
Okay, this should do it.

123
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:38,927
How many more should we set up?

124
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,327
How I wish night time would come quickly.

125
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,327
Huh?

126
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:49,627
What's that tool for?

127
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:52,527
I wonder what someone would be doing in a place like this.

128
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:54,927
The car keys are still in the truck.

129
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:57,627
Hey! What the heck are you looking at? -What?

130
00:07:59,027 --> 00:08:00,727
Well. You see...

131
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:03,227
It's the guy who plays pachinko.

132
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:05,627
Didn't I tell you I didn't play?

133
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:08,427
What are you guys doing in a place like this?

134
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:11,127
We came to catch beetles.

135
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:13,327
Don't you dare come near my truck.

136
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,927
Scat!

137
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,327
We were just looking around.

138
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:18,827
Get out of here right this minute!

139
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:20,827
If you don't, I'm giving you guys a licking!

140
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:23,127
Let's go. -Okay, okay.

141
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:27,127
He didn't have to get so angry.

142
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:30,327
I wonder if there was something he didn't want us to see?

143
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:31,827
What did you just say?

144
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:40,327
You're still making those weird inventions of yours.

145
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:42,827
Calling them weird is unnecessary, I think.

146
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:48,527
I think it's about time.

147
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:49,927
I guess so.

148
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:51,327
I think you'll be okay,

149
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:54,227
but be careful because there are snakes around here.

150
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:55,527
What?

151
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:57,527
Letting the children go on their own worries me,

152
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:59,727
so I guess I'll go with them after all.

153
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:02,027
Ryutaro, you go ahead and sleep without me.

154
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:03,027
Okay.

155
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:05,227
Wow!

156
00:09:05,227 --> 00:09:08,027
It's beetles! The beetles are here!

157
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:11,227
Awesome! Let me catch them!

158
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:13,727
I did it!

159
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,427
Okay. Let's go catch some more!

160
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:19,227
There's a giant stag beetle here!

161
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:23,127
Look! A saw tooth stag beetle!

162
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:27,327
Awesome! This is the first time I've seen something like this!

163
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:28,827
Look at this one!

164
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:31,027
This one is bigger.

165
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:33,427
Let's make them compete as soon as we get home!

166
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:35,627
Yes! -I can't wait!

167
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,627
I tell you.

168
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:42,427
That Ryutaro. You can never be too careful with him.

169
00:09:42,427 --> 00:09:44,827
He's doing sneaky things behind my back.

170
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:46,727
I won't let him get away with this.

171
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:49,127
That's the man we saw this afternoon.

172
00:09:50,127 --> 00:09:52,027
Someone from a department store in Tokyo

173
00:09:52,027 --> 00:09:53,627
is going to come to purchase them.

174
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:56,427
I can't sell them if they become weak!

175
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:59,227
He's the man we saw at the roadside resting place.

176
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:02,327
He was saying something about Ryutaro.

177
00:10:03,527 --> 00:10:05,127
Big catch, big catch!

178
00:10:05,127 --> 00:10:07,227
That is what fishermen say.

179
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:09,927
It seems he's still awake.

180
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:12,927
Strange. The paper sliding door is open.

181
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:19,627
Sir, please get a hold of yourself!

182
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:20,927
What happened?

183
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:22,327
Ryutaro!

184
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:24,227
Sir!

185
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:27,427
Sir, we'll call the ambulance right away.

186
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:33,727
Miyama... Stag Beetle...

187
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:35,727
Did you say Miyama stag beetle?

188
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:37,327
What do you mean?

189
00:10:39,327 --> 00:10:41,127
Ai, call an ambulance!

190
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:42,327
Yes!

191
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:47,227
Huh? -What's the matter?

192
00:10:47,227 --> 00:10:49,527
The statue of Buddha that was here is gone.

193
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:52,427
Just hurry and call the ambulance first.

194
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:54,127
Yes.

195
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:55,527
We're out of the service area!

196
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,527
What's this?

197
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:07,127
Anyway, I wonder

198
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:09,727
what he meant by saying "Miyama stag beetle".

199
00:11:16,505 --> 00:11:20,605
Mr. Namatame was taken to the hospital while unconscious.

200
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,730
And then, the police began their investigation.

201
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,130
"Detective Motohashi (45)" -Miyama stag beetle?

202
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,030
Did he really say that?

203
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,230
Yeah. -We heard him say so too.

204
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,330
Yeah...

205
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,130
"Detective Fuji (27)" -It's not something we'd expect one would say

206
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,730
just before passing out.

207
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,430
I wonder what it means.

208
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,530
Beats me.

209
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,930
There's one other thing that's bothering me.

210
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,730
What is it? -The statue of Buddha

211
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,630
that was there when we left has gone missing.

212
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,030
A statue of Buddha?

213
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,330
Come to think of it, there have been a series of statues

214
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,230
being stolen from temples in this prefecture.

215
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,830
The robber broke in to steal the statue

216
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,430
and ran into the victim,

217
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,130
then struck him with the vase that was there.

218
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,030
I guess that's what happened. -Yeah.

219
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,930
Excuse me.

220
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,030
This was found on Mr. Namatame's clothes.

221
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,730
It's some sort of hair.

222
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,630
Give it to forensics team. -Yes, sir.

223
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:19,530
I wonder why Ryutaro mentioned Miyama stag beetle.

224
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,730
There's no way that a Miyama stag beetle could be the culprit.

225
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,330
Hey. We saw that man on our way back, didn't we?

226
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,730
That Ryutaro. You can never be too careful with him.

227
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:36,030
He had a Miyama stag beetle at the roadside resting place!

228
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,130
Do you know his name?

229
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:41,030
Mr. Namatame called him Shuhei.

230
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,830
I think he's referring to

231
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,130
"Officer Iwanaga (55)" -Mr. Shuhei Ikeda who lives in this village.

232
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,930
Let go of me!

233
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,030
Just what the hell are you saying I did?

234
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,230
It seems that you had some issues with Mr. Namatame

235
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,130
regarding where the border of your land is.

236
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,330
Yeah, that place has been our land since the time of my ancestors.

237
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,530
He had the nerve to turn it into a field without permission.

238
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,030
But I didn't attack him!

239
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,030
Where were you at around 12 am last night?

240
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,230
12 am? -He was walking along the road.

241
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,630
He looked really angry and was saying,

242
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,330
"That Ryutaro. You can never be too careful with him."

243
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,830
Well, that's...

244
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,730
Is that true?

245
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,030
I went on my routine check around the area

246
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,330
and found that the water of the field was turned off.

247
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,130
I figured that only Ryutaro would do something like that

248
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,530
and thought I'd give him a piece of my mind the next time I see him!

249
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,630
I bet you gave him a piece of your mind last night, no?

250
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,830
No. I didn't do it.

251
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,630
Please believe me!

252
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,830
Sir, did you know that there was a statue of Buddha

253
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,030
in the alcove on the other side?

254
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,430
A statue of Buddha?

255
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,130
Yeah, there was a very dirty one there.

256
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,830
It seems that the culprit who attacked Mr. Namatame took it.

257
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,530
You're not the one, are you?

258
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,030
You mean the statue of Buddha?

259
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,830
I see, so a robber came to steal the statue.

260
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,530
If so, I know who might have done it.

261
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,930
Really?

262
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,130
It's Kei.

263
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,030
He has things like a fret saw and a grinder loaded in his truck

264
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,430
and goes out night after night.

265
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,930
So, I was thinking that something was fishy!

266
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,630
It's true that he had them in his truck.

267
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,930
Yeah. He was really angry at us because we saw them.

268
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,630
True, he was really angry.

269
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,730
Come to think of it,

270
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,730
he was wearing a T-shirt with the picture of a Miyama stag beetle on it.

271
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,530
Who is it?

272
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,830
We're the police.

273
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,230
We have something we'd like to ask you.

274
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,430
Could we ask you to come with us?

275
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,030
What the heck is it?

276
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,830
Just what did I do?

277
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,030
Where were you at about 12 am last night?

278
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,530
12 am?

279
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,830
Where else would I be if not at home?

280
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,030
That's a lie!

281
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,530
After I went to check around the field, I passed in front of your house,

282
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,430
but the truck wasn't there!

283
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,030
You broke into the house to steal the statue of Buddha,

284
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,230
but Mr. Namatame found you, so you hit him on the head and fled.

285
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,630
Isn't that what happened?

286
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,630
Hold it there!

287
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,830
If I came to steal something from here, I wouldn't come by truck.

288
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,430
Don't you think so? It's walking distance.

289
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,630
Then, where were you at around 12 am last night?

290
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,330
Well...

291
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,530
Either way, I didn't attack Mr. Namatame!

292
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,930
It's true!

293
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,330
Did you find out what the hair was?

294
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,530
Oh, yeah. It was a dog's hair.

295
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,230
Dog's hair?

296
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,430
I wonder what someone would be doing in a place like this.

297
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,930
The car keys are still in the truck.

298
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,530
Hey! What are you looking at? -What?

299
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,630
Just as I thought.

300
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,830
Neither of the two attacked Mr. Namatame.

301
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,830
If they didn't, who on earth did?

302
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,030
Are you blind or what?

303
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,430
It's you, Ai.

304
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,730
What do you mean, "It's you, Ai"?

305
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,830
Just what do you propose to do now?

306
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,030
Those two aren't the culprit.

307
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,730
But they're both connected to the Miyama stag beetle, aren't they?

308
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,930
If it were one of them,

309
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,130
I'm sure Mr. Namatame would've said their names.

310
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,430
Then, who on earth is the culprit?

311
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,930
I don't know. However,

312
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,230
the culprit who attacked Mr. Namatame

313
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,330
took the statue of Buddha, that's for sure.

314
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,330
I wonder if that dirty looking statue

315
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,930
is really worth any value.

316
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,130
Beats me.

317
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,030
He did say that it was made in the Kamakura era though.

318
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,630
Mr. Namatame mentioned that it may have been made by Unkei.

319
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,030
Well, though it's true that Unkei

320
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,730
made some items in the Kamakura era,

321
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,830
it could also have been made in the Heian era, right?

322
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:09,830
No, I'm sure I heard that it was from the Kamakura era.

323
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,730
I wonder where I heard that.

324
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,530
Well, there are also a lot of old junk.

325
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,330
The antique shop dealer that came the other day

326
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,830
said that the statue of Buddha that I put on the alcove

327
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:24,530
was something from the Kamakura era.

328
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,730
It was at that roadside resting place!

329
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,830
Ai, let's try going to the roadside resting place

330
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,130
that we passed by when coming here!

331
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,330
"Roadside Resting Place"

332
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,330
We came here yesterday, but do you remember us?

333
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,830
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

334
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,430
If you come up with anything...

335
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:44,330
Hi, madam. We came here yesterday. Do you remember us?

336
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,530
Yes, you're the ones who came along with Mr. Namatame, right?

337
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,330
I remember you.

338
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,230
Do you remember if there was anyone else back then?

339
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,330
Well, let me see.

340
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,330
Oh, my! How cute!

341
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,930
There was a young couple.

342
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,830
Do you remember anything about them?

343
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,830
Not really.

344
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,530
All they did was buying a potted plant, you see.

345
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,830
What kind of potted plant was it?

346
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,430
This one.

347
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,030
It has an interesting name, don't you think?

348
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,230
It's a bit different from what we like though.

349
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,930
This is...

350
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,130
Oh, my God.

351
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,030
So, that's the story.

352
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,630
Didn't that young couple bring a dog with them?

353
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,730
Oh, I'm surprised you know that.

354
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,430
That's right.

355
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,730
I wonder where Conan and the others went?

356
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,730
Doc went with them too.

357
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,330
I hope they're not having lunch without us.

358
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,230
At any rate, we'll hear out

359
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,330
the rest of your story at the station.

360
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,630
I'm telling you, I have nothing to do with this.

361
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,230
Same here. -Hold it there.

362
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,230
Suddenly, just like that again...

363
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,630
Those two aren't the culprit.

364
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,030
What?

365
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,830
Well, Kei is guilty of stealing a statue of Buddha, though.

366
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,130
Don't be ridiculous!

367
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,930
I looked beneath your truck.

368
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,930
The statue was tied onto it.

369
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:22,630
You went to some temple last night to steal it, right?

370
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,130
How can you be so sure

371
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,930
that these two didn't attack Mr. Namatame?

372
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,730
The reason is simple.

373
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,030
If it were one of them, Ryutaro knows their name.

374
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,030
He would never have said, "Miyama stag beetle".

375
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,830
Maybe it was dark when he was suddenly attacked

376
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,630
that he couldn't see the culprit's face?

377
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,530
When we got back, the light of the Japanese room was on.

378
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,930
Ryutaro had gone to bed,

379
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,530
but noticed a sound and came to the Japanese room.

380
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,630
He was attacked after he switched on the light.

381
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,830
What if the culprit's face was hidden?

382
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,130
I'm sure that if it were one of the two,

383
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,530
Ryutaro would've been able to recognize them.

384
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:07,030
The fact is, on our way here yesterday,

385
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,030
we stopped by at a roadside resting place.

386
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,130
Ryutaro was bragging back then that stolen statue of Buddha

387
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,330
was something from the Kamakura era.

388
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,930
At the time, a couple who seemed like tourists were there.

389
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:25,930
That couple bought a potted plant at that roadside resting place.

390
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,530
This is the one.

391
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,930
-This is... -This is...

392
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,230
"Miyama Stag Beetle"

393
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,730
Right.

394
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,030
Miyama Stag Beetle was the name of this flower

395
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,830
and not the name of an insect.

396
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,830
Ryutaro saw the culprit, but he didn't know their name.

397
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,130
That's why he wanted to let us know that the culprit

398
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:53,730
was the one who bought the Miyama stag beetle potted plant.

399
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,030
Proof... Do you have proof?

400
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,330
According to the woman who sold them the plant,

401
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:04,530
the couple had a Maltese with them.

402
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,330
A Maltese?

403
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,330
Dog hair was also found on Ryutaro's clothes.

404
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,030
A DNA test should clarify everything.

405
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,930
I'm sure that the couple is the culprit.

406
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,130
You can take over from here, officers.

407
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,630
After that, the police checked on

408
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,130
all hotels and pensions in the area where pets are allowed,

409
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,130
and the identity of the couple was revealed.

410
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,230
The couple who was arrested in Tokyo

411
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,330
heard that the statue was one that was made in the Kamakura era,

412
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,130
and thought that it could be sold at a high price.

413
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,730
That's why they tailed our car

414
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,230
and went to rob it from Mr. Namatame's house.

415
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,030
However, when they took the statue to an antique shop,

416
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,730
they were told that it wasn't made by Unkei or anyone special,

417
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,230
and was worth only 5,000 yen at most.

418
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,830
Meanwhile, Mr. Namatame recovered

419
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,530
and was discharged a few days later.

420
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,030
How about it? Fantastic, huh?

421
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,930
We caught it ourselves!

422
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,730
A giant stag beetle.

423
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,630
You mean the name of this plant is Miyama Stag Beetle?

424
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,130
Right.

425
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,330
Are you really going to give it to class?

426
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,630
Yeah, mother told me to show it to everyone in class

427
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,930
because it's a really rare flower.

428
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,030
Then, let's decide on who the watering monitor will be!

429
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,630
Great! How should we decide?

430
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,130
Too bad you couldn't brag about your beetles.

431
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,330
Yeah, you worked hard for nothing.

432
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,830
Cool! How are you doing?

433
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,630
It's a map, right?

434
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,630
Is it a treasure map?

435
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,930
Maybe this map has nothing to do with a burglary,

436
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,430
but rather, has something to do with Mr. Kouzuki's case.

437
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,630
What do you think? The map, do we have a case?

438
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:27,130
No connection. I'd like to say that, but...

439
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:33,530
Next Conan, "Good Work, Cool 2"

440
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,630
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,530
"Cigarette butts"

442
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,530
Today is the Star Festival Day.

443
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,830
When stars and wind fall.

444
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,630
That's a godsend.
