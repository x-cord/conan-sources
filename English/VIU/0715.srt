1
00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:05,106
Suspicious of Inspector Otaki's actions, we followed him

2
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:08,306
and came to a mansion in the remote mountains.

3
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:11,606
There, we encounter siblings in a disquieting atmosphere

4
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:13,806
about to discuss the distribution of inheritance.

5
00:00:15,906 --> 00:00:18,006
With the whereabouts of the owner of the mansion still unknown,

6
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:20,206
when the family takes a family photograph,

7
00:00:20,206 --> 00:00:21,706
the eerie owner of the mansion

8
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:24,806
who wasn't supposed to be there was in it.

9
00:00:25,306 --> 00:00:27,806
After that, everyone gets text mail from the owner

10
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:29,906
asking them to gather in the dining room,

11
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:31,606
where they witness the eerie figure of the owner

12
00:00:31,606 --> 00:00:35,106
floating in mid air and a monster flying through the sky.

13
00:00:35,106 --> 00:00:39,606
Then later, the second son's dead body is found.

14
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,806
Moreover, the dead body of the oldest daughter

15
00:00:41,806 --> 00:00:43,206
is found in the forest

16
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:45,906
and the remaining siblings wait for the break of dawn

17
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:49,006
in each of their rooms. However...

18
00:00:49,206 --> 00:00:51,906
I'm sure the culprit is that person.

19
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:53,206
Right, Kudo?

20
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:54,506
Yeah.

21
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:56,806
But we have no proof.

22
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,306
How did that person go pass the gate

23
00:01:00,306 --> 00:01:03,006
and kill Kamiyo in the forest?

24
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:07,706
Aim for a 100% solution.

25
00:01:07,706 --> 00:01:09,906
Clear all mysteries and codes.

26
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:11,906
The sharp deductions of the two

27
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,906
shed light on the darkness of the vampire case.

28
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:15,306
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:17,206
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:17,206 --> 00:01:20,206
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:05,350
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (Four)"

32
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,950
Oh, I'm sorry.

33
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,050
I was going to let her drink sake and calm her down

34
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,950
but she seems to have fallen asleep

35
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,350
so you can put it away already.

36
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,050
Oh, is that so...

37
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,250
I'm sorry, after you brought it all this way...

38
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,950
Oh, no problem.

39
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,850
"Torakura Ruri (38), Asanobu's wife"

40
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,850
How about you, Kishiharu? Would like some sake?

41
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,350
No, none for me.

42
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,050
I'll go back to my room, lock the door and hit the sack.

43
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,150
I've stopped drinking ever since Yoko's accident.

44
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,450
-"Hinohara Hikaru (24), Household Maid" -I see.

45
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,650
I told you to get out!

46
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,250
Johei.

47
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,950
Leave me alone.

48
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,150
Really, I tell you.

49
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,750
I just wanted to comfort you.

50
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,950
What's with you?

51
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,350
Aren't you sad despite your older sister being killed?

52
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,450
I guess so. But, she's only my half-sister.

53
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,750
And she was a formidable love rival too.

54
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,750
You mean you think that we were meant to be together after all.

55
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,150
You gotta be joking!

56
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,350
How cute!

57
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,750
My, sake.

58
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,850
May I have it?

59
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,650
Oh, sure.

60
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,450
I feel like drinking tonight, you see.

61
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,250
-"Gunma Prefectural Police" -What? Another one since then?

62
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,750
Has been killed?

63
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,250
Are you serious, Heiji?

64
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,250
Yeah.

65
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,850
The gate guard heard the ringtone of a cell phone in the forest.

66
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,250
I hope my daughter's okay?

67
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,550
Of course. She's carefreely making pot sticks with Kazuha.

68
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,650
Pot sticks?

69
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,650
And? You haven't figure out who the culprit is yet?

70
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,750
Yes...

71
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,750
I know already!

72
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,750
Yeah.

73
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,450
That person's the only one capable of carrying out this trick!

74
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,050
Then, hurry up arrest him and handcuff him!

75
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,650
Handcuff.

76
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,750
We can't.

77
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,450
We've got no proof, and an unsolved trick still remains.

78
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,150
Do you think anyone can go out of the gate

79
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,950
without being seen by any one,

80
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:26,050
strangle somebody then sneak back pass the gate again?

81
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,250
Huh?

82
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,350
Of course, sensors are set up on the fence,

83
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,350
and if someone tries to go over it, they'd be caught immediately.

84
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,850
The only time the gate guards left their post

85
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,550
was when the tunnel collapsed.

86
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,550
How about it?

87
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,350
Maybe the culprit killed Kamiyo inside the fence,

88
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,150
then threw her out and fled?

89
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,250
Idiot!

90
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,450
How much strength do you think the culprit will need?

91
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,250
There's something on my knees.

92
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,650
When I checked Kamiyo's body in the forest and got on my knees...

93
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,850
But, what is this?

94
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,850
This white crystallized substance.

95
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,450
Mixed with mud.

96
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,250
The feel of this...

97
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,450
could it be salt?

98
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,350
But, what would this be in a place like that?

99
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,350
But, no matter how much you train using a barbell at a gym,

100
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,850
it's impossible, don't you think?

101
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,850
The corpse was tied to a pole, you know!

102
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,050
Bar...

103
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,250
Barbell?

104
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,950
So, now we know for sure.

105
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,750
The culprit's not a vampire with wings.

106
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,150
Yeah.

107
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,350
They're a demon all right...

108
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,750
But they're more of a bloodthirsty killer!

109
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,350
Mail from the owner?

110
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,250
Come to the European room so that I can tell you

111
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,550
what I was going to talk to you about in the morning but couldn't.

112
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,150
Of course come here without being noticed by anyone.

113
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,250
Hakuya Torakura.

114
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,350
I wonder what it's about?

115
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,850
Maybe he's fine and knows who the real culprit is?

116
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,850
But, he sure looked like a vampire to me, though.

117
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,250
Hikaru.

118
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,050
I would like to talk to you for a minute.

119
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,150
Okay.

120
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,250
I'm really getting sleepy.

121
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,650
Oh, no! It's already 5:00 in the morning.

122
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,550
No good, we've got to go to sleep right away!

123
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,250
Oh, the phone. It's from Heiji!

124
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,950
What is it, Heiji? Are you hungry?

125
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,650
There are still plenty of pot sticks, you know!

126
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,650
Huh?

127
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,950
Okay... okay.

128
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,350
I got it!

129
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,450
You can count on me!

130
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,350
What did Hattori want?

131
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,450
Ran, do you have a hairpin?

132
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,450
Huh?

133
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,050
Sir...

134
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,250
Sir!

135
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,850
This is Hikaru.

136
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,050
I've come after reading the mail.

137
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,350
Sir.

138
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,950
With this...

139
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,850
This is it!

140
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,450
Uh...

141
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,950
Are you all right?

142
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,150
Don't come out!

143
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,950
The only thing you need to help us with is your voice!

144
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,350
Yes.

145
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,650
Huh?

146
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,550
He's gone.

147
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,550
True.

148
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,550
He's vanished.

149
00:09:41,316 --> 00:09:43,516
Darn.

150
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,516
My body's stuck.

151
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:46,916
Of course it is.

152
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:51,716
That's the corridor that the owner made for Hikaru.

153
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,616
Of course it wouldn't fit your body.

154
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:57,616
Mr. Johei Hagawa?

155
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:04,016
The fact that the owner gave Hikaru clothes as gifts

156
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:08,116
means that he knew her size.

157
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:09,216
Right.

158
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:11,516
The tragedy that occurred tonight, the serial killings

159
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:14,116
was what the owner had entrusted Hikaru to execute.

160
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:16,116
He texted Hikaru to come to the European room this morning

161
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:20,716
so that he could explain all the tricks that were used up to now.

162
00:10:20,716 --> 00:10:22,616
But, you snatched everything from the side, didn't you?

163
00:10:22,616 --> 00:10:26,916
You saw the mail from the owner on Hikaru's cell phone

164
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:31,716
that was being charged in the bathroom!

165
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:34,016
It seems that Hikaru didn't see that mail

166
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:36,916
until after noon today, you see.

167
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,016
What makes you think it was me?

168
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:43,116
Kishiharu who came before noon could've seen it too, right?

169
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:45,016
The contents of the mail

170
00:10:45,016 --> 00:10:48,916
was for her to come to the European room after breakfast.

171
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,216
Even if he did see that mail before noon,

172
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:54,216
he would think that the owner wouldn't be waiting already, right?

173
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:56,516
And, even if that mail were to be unread,

174
00:10:56,516 --> 00:10:58,416
the two could've coincidentally met somewhere,

175
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,816
and finished what they were going to talk about already.

176
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:04,016
Or, he could've thought that the owner who was stood,

177
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:06,616
decided to forget about it and go to sleep.

178
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:07,716
If anyone were to have seen that mail

179
00:11:07,716 --> 00:11:10,116
and go to the European room,

180
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:13,316
you and Kamiyo who were there since the night before,

181
00:11:13,316 --> 00:11:14,916
were the only ones who would've gone.

182
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,816
Since Kamiyo was killed,

183
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:20,016
the only one left would be you!

184
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:23,916
There's a possibility that the butler and maids also saw it but...

185
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,816
being that the owner was trying to relay

186
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:28,716
something so important by texting means that...

187
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:31,316
he must've been convince that there is no one

188
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,116
in this mansion who would do something so atrocious

189
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:35,316
as to read another person's mail without permission.

190
00:11:35,316 --> 00:11:39,316
So, you, being concerned of what the talk was about

191
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:42,816
snuck over to the European room and saw it.

192
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:45,616
That the owner had cut off his own neck with the guillotine

193
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:47,416
and died.

194
00:11:49,816 --> 00:11:52,816
I'm sure it was near the corpse of the owner, right?

195
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:56,116
His cell phone, the key to the freezer

196
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,716
and the switch to explode the tunnel

197
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:01,416
with this plan of carrying out the serial killings.

198
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,416
Stop talking like you saw me doing it!

199
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,016
But this serial killing

200
00:12:07,016 --> 00:12:09,616
is something that cannot be carried out

201
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:12,216
unless Hakuya cuts his neck off.

202
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:14,916
One of them is the trick when he suddenly

203
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,216
vanished from the coffin!

204
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:20,816
If he did it on his own, it would've been easy but...

205
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:23,416
if somebody did it using his corpse,

206
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,716
it had to be done using only his head.

207
00:12:26,716 --> 00:12:32,016
We got to him as soon as we heard

208
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:34,616
Kazuha and Ran scream.

209
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:37,816
I'll bet you snuck over to the storeroom down stairs,

210
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:39,616
and retrieved the head of the corpse

211
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:41,516
using the hidden corridor.

212
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:43,516
The only thing that Kazuha saw that was real

213
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:45,216
was probably just the head,

214
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:47,116
and as to his clothes, you probably stuffed something inside

215
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:49,516
to make it look real.

216
00:12:49,516 --> 00:12:51,316
If his body was real too,

217
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:53,616
when you pulled his body out of the coffin,

218
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:57,016
it'd have swayed and made noises.

219
00:12:57,516 --> 00:12:59,816
You then used the remote controller

220
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:02,116
to unlock the lid of the coffin,

221
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:03,516
and while everyone was taken aback in surprise

222
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,516
about Hakuya's body having vanished.

223
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:07,316
You took Hakuya's head over to the closet

224
00:13:07,316 --> 00:13:11,316
where the family picture was going to be taken, didn't you?

225
00:13:11,316 --> 00:13:14,516
In order to come up with that psychic picture that was taken.

226
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:18,616
There is a bar in the closet to hang clothes on to begin with

227
00:13:18,616 --> 00:13:21,016
so it's easy to hang his head on it too.

228
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:22,716
You came later than everyone to the coffin room

229
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:26,116
because you had to do all this, right?

230
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:28,816
That psychic picture.

231
00:13:28,816 --> 00:13:32,216
Since you were beside the magic mirror,

232
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:33,916
you could've positioned yourself

233
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,816
so that Kamiyo wouldn't be reflected in the mirror too.

234
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,516
Back then, if you had the remote controller

235
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:43,916
to light up Hakuya's face that was in the closet,

236
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,216
by using the right timing.

237
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:49,016
It would've been possible for you to make Hakuya's face

238
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:50,916
emerge on the mirror!

239
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:53,716
And the last trick was

240
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:55,916
when Hakuya appeared by the dining room window

241
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,516
hanging upside down!

242
00:13:58,516 --> 00:14:00,416
A strange shadow?

243
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:09,216
You waited for Asanaobu at the smoking room,

244
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,316
waited for a chance to cut open his artery

245
00:14:12,316 --> 00:14:14,216
and killed him then.

246
00:14:14,216 --> 00:14:16,416
You pulled a fishing line through the hinge

247
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,916
of the sliding storm shutter of the smoking room

248
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:21,316
and hung down both ends of the line to the dining room below.

249
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:24,216
You tied Hakuya's head onto one end of the line

250
00:14:24,216 --> 00:14:28,216
then hooked the other end to the frame of the window, right?

251
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:29,716
By doing this, when the window was opened,

252
00:14:29,716 --> 00:14:32,716
the line would come off and his head would fall down.

253
00:14:33,216 --> 00:14:34,816
Hold it!

254
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:38,516
When I opened the window, the head vanished above, didn't it?

255
00:14:40,316 --> 00:14:42,516
If that was only his head,

256
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:45,916
maybe somebody was upstairs and pulled it up?

257
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,516
Convex lens.

258
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:50,716
The upper right pane of that window alone

259
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:53,716
was made of convex lens, just like a magnifying glass.

260
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:55,516
If through that lens depending on the angle,

261
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:58,616
the object looks upside down.

262
00:14:58,616 --> 00:15:02,616
That's why although it fell down, it looked like it went up!

263
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:05,516
Moreover, the three panes below the convex lens

264
00:15:05,516 --> 00:15:07,516
are ordinary glass.

265
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:10,316
Of course, if the head looked as if it fell down,

266
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:11,616
the trick won't work.

267
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:15,216
That's why this trick couldn't have been done by anyone

268
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:17,916
other than you, who blocked the view of the lower three panes

269
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,316
with your own body at the time.

270
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:23,716
The head finally fell into the pot that was together

271
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:26,716
with the planters on the veranda outside the window.

272
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:30,516
When we went to look afterwards, that jar was placed aside

273
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:33,616
and Hakuya's head was still inside.

274
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:36,216
Well, we wouldn't have realized this, unless Hikaru

275
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:39,316
told us that she saw the silhouette of Hakuya's head

276
00:15:39,316 --> 00:15:41,916
through the curtains

277
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,716
during the flash of lightning come from below.

278
00:15:43,716 --> 00:15:47,916
The big bird that we saw outside the window right after was...

279
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,616
A plane with flapping wings!

280
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:53,216
If you left it on the roof outside of the smoking room

281
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:55,416
and started its motor by a remote

282
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,516
just before opening the window...

283
00:15:58,516 --> 00:16:00,916
It'd fly away in the sky just as you open the window

284
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,616
and that was your setup.

285
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:06,016
Well, as to the plane, I'm sure we'll find it

286
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:07,616
somewhere in the forest later.

287
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:11,616
Then what about Honey who killed in the forest?

288
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:14,116
Are you saying that I did that too?

289
00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:16,616
The gate guard only left the post for an instant

290
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:19,216
but Honey was tied to a pole, wasn't she?

291
00:16:19,216 --> 00:16:21,716
How could I do something like that

292
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:23,216
when I never once left the mansion?

293
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,916
The wheels made of ice!

294
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:30,016
On both ends of the pole that Kamiyo was tied on,

295
00:16:30,016 --> 00:16:33,216
you attached wheels of ice onto it like barbells.

296
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:35,316
Then, while the gate guards

297
00:16:35,316 --> 00:16:37,816
were distracted by the explosion of the tunnel,

298
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:41,316
you rolled it down from the stairs right in front of the gate.

299
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:45,616
The corpse while getting its fingertips all jammed up,

300
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:46,616
went pass the gate,

301
00:16:46,616 --> 00:16:49,516
bumped into the trees and stopped in the forest!

302
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:52,516
All you had to do after that was, wait for the ice to melt,

303
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:54,516
ring Kamiyo's cell phone

304
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:57,716
and make the gate guards find her corpse.

305
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:01,616
It's humid tonight and it was also raining.

306
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:04,516
On top of that it seemed you mixed salt into the ice

307
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:06,516
to make it melt faster too!

308
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:11,616
By the way, you made the ice wheels using the locked freezer!

309
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:15,616
You stood a can of laver in the center of a toy pool

310
00:17:15,616 --> 00:17:18,716
then partitioned them with a sheet of paper or something

311
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:20,816
to make two wheels, didn't you?

312
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:24,016
You took the ice wheels from the freezer

313
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:27,316
then rolled them over to the stairs so...

314
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:29,616
the flour that Ran and Kazuha spilled on the floor

315
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:33,116
wiped off leaving a track just the width of the wheels behind.

316
00:17:33,116 --> 00:17:35,516
Gosh, these kids have the nerve

317
00:17:35,516 --> 00:17:37,616
to line up such nonsense despite no proof.

318
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:40,516
You've got the proof, don't you?

319
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:45,316
You didn't delete Hakuya's mail from Hikaru's cell phone

320
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:48,016
because you wanted to frame her later.

321
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:50,116
Hey.

322
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:52,616
That's why in order to shut Hikaru up,

323
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:55,216
we figured you'd be luring her out somewhere.

324
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:57,116
"To Hikaru"

325
00:17:57,116 --> 00:18:03,316
Together with this murder plan sheet that he made!

326
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:08,616
That's the proof, Mr. Johei Hagawa.

327
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,716
On this plan sheet it says

328
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:13,816
to call Mr. Hagawa over to the European room, kill him,

329
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:18,516
then lock the room and leave.

330
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:20,016
Just as written on the plan sheet, you acted out

331
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,016
being called over to the European room by Hikaru,

332
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:23,216
and wanted everybody to think that

333
00:18:23,216 --> 00:18:27,716
you killed her in self defense because she attacked you.

334
00:18:27,716 --> 00:18:31,216
So, if you placed the plan sheet next to Hikaru's corpse

335
00:18:31,216 --> 00:18:33,116
and called everybody over,

336
00:18:33,116 --> 00:18:36,516
that would complete the scenario that you counter-attacked

337
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:39,716
the killer who was planning to kill you!

338
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:41,216
Darn.

339
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:43,416
How'd these brats get to all this...

340
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,016
It would've worked out well otherwise.

341
00:18:46,016 --> 00:18:49,216
We thought there was something fishy about you

342
00:18:49,216 --> 00:18:50,716
ever since you insisted on

343
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:53,616
having the blood stain on the coffin checked more carefully.

344
00:18:53,616 --> 00:18:55,116
Why?

345
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:56,616
That blood was the blood that dripped

346
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:58,616
when I put the head into the coffin.

347
00:18:58,616 --> 00:19:01,316
The police investigated and concluded that

348
00:19:01,316 --> 00:19:03,016
it wasn't Hakuya's blood!

349
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,116
The police goofed on it, didn't they?

350
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:06,916
The blood spot we found at the coffin back then,

351
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,916
was it really of type AB?

352
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,216
More than that, I think that

353
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:15,216
you should check that blood a bit more carefully.

354
00:19:15,216 --> 00:19:17,116
Like for DNA.

355
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:19,816
Hakuya probably had cancer.

356
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:22,116
In the final stages, it's possible that

357
00:19:22,116 --> 00:19:24,116
the blood type of the person changes.

358
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:26,516
If the person has blood type A, he could become blood type AB.

359
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:28,716
If blood type O, then type B.

360
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:32,016
Being able to say that, this is a mistake to begin with...

361
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:36,816
you have to be the one who put Hakuya's head into the coffin.

362
00:19:36,816 --> 00:19:40,616
Well, your blood type also changed because of this plan sheet.

363
00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:46,516
It seems to have changed into the blood of a ruthless killer.

364
00:21:12,116 --> 00:21:14,616
My dear daughter?

365
00:21:14,616 --> 00:21:16,416
The beginning of that plan sheet,

366
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,916
did it begin with the line, "My dear daughter"?

367
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:22,016
Yeah. It seems that he lied to the butler

368
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:24,516
who he figured was kenn, though.

369
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,416
There's no mistake about it because

370
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:30,316
a will and DNA certificate were found in his room.

371
00:21:30,316 --> 00:21:34,916
You mean he tried to make his real daughter commit a serial crime?

372
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,116
That's right.

373
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:38,016
After putting fangs on his teeth

374
00:21:38,016 --> 00:21:39,716
and making everyone believe that

375
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,716
he did all this after turning into a vampire.

376
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,216
His motive was to avenge the death of Yoko

377
00:21:46,216 --> 00:21:48,516
who was supposed to become his bride.

378
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:52,316
It seems that Mr. Hagawa is talking his mouth off.

379
00:21:52,316 --> 00:21:55,216
Saying that the maid Ms. Shimizu, Kamiyo,

380
00:21:55,216 --> 00:21:59,616
Asanobu and himself schemed the accident that lead to Yoko's death.

381
00:21:59,616 --> 00:22:01,616
Which means that the murder of Ms. Shimizu

382
00:22:01,616 --> 00:22:03,516
that occurred six months ago...

383
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:06,516
Was committed by Hakuya.

384
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:11,016
It was written on the will that he sucked her blood.

385
00:22:11,016 --> 00:22:14,216
But since he was a doctor, he probably

386
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:16,316
made her drink a drug to inhibit blood coagulation,

387
00:22:16,316 --> 00:22:18,716
then inserted a catheter into her artery

388
00:22:18,716 --> 00:22:20,716
and drained her blood.

389
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:25,016
Besides, Hakuya probably tied Ms. Shimizu to the pole

390
00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:29,016
to camouflage the ice wheel trick.

391
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:33,816
But, if Hikaru was the one who got to see the plan sheet first...

392
00:22:33,816 --> 00:22:36,116
Things would've been okay.

393
00:22:36,116 --> 00:22:38,916
This is what was written at the end of the plan sheet.

394
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:42,216
"But if you decide to forgive everything and everyone,"

395
00:22:42,216 --> 00:22:45,416
"please burn this plan sheet along with the blaze of revenge"

396
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,916
"that's been haunting me from deep within."

397
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:51,716
I'm sure that Hikaru would've chosen to do just that!

398
00:22:51,716 --> 00:22:53,916
I bet.

399
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:57,916
But, that guy called Hagawa is totally absurd.

400
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,116
The nerve of him to kill his lover, Kamiyo,

401
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:01,116
just as the plan sheet had it, seeing through the fact that

402
00:23:01,116 --> 00:23:02,916
Mina would want to get back together with him again,

403
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:05,716
and that he would eventually get hold of the money.

404
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:10,016
Well, there is no denying he was a foolish man.

405
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:14,116
The least you can do is take good care of her.

406
00:23:14,116 --> 00:23:16,316
Women can be scary, you know.

407
00:23:16,316 --> 00:23:19,116
Huh, what on earth are you talking about?

408
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,516
Wait.

409
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,116
That smell...

410
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:36,116
I wonder how many pot sticks they ate.

411
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:43,616
The fact is, a letter like this was delivered to me.

412
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,716
Mr. Jisaburo Izumi's life is in danger.

413
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,716
Huh?

414
00:23:50,816 --> 00:23:54,216
You can't trust anybody.

415
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:59,216
But, I can trust the boy who saved my life.

416
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,416
Next Conan,

417
