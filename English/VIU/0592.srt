five, six, seven, eigth, nine, ten.

3
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:12,119
One, two...

4
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:20,875
I give up.

5
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,475
You're pretty good like always.

6
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,475
Kazumi!

7
00:00:31,475 --> 00:00:33,175
"Kazumi Tsukamoto(18)" -What brings you here?

8
00:00:33,175 --> 00:00:34,475
"Former Karate Captain" -I thought I'd flex my body a bit

9
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:36,975
because I've been doing nothing but studying for exams recently.

10
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:39,875
Mouri, be my partner a while, will you?

11
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,475
Yes. It's my pleasure.

12
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:49,075
Give it all you got, okay?

13
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:50,575
Of course.

14
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:24,075
Brooding over passing seasons

15
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:25,975
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

16
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:27,775
Rooster Man appears at the shrines.

17
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:29,975
And the mystery of the 9 monkeys emerges.

18
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:31,575
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:33,475
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:35,875
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

"The Tori's Pledge of Monkey and Rake (Part 1)"

22
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:09,901
"Ranburi Shrine, Second Rooster Day"

23
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:12,324
Quite a festival, isn't it?

24
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:15,324
So many different kinds of bamboo rakes are being sold.

25
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:17,324
Just as would be expected of Tori no Ichi.

26
00:03:17,324 --> 00:03:18,624
This is the first time I've been here,

27
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:21,224
but I didn't think it be so grand.

28
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:24,824
What kind of rake did you guys come to buy anyway?

29
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:28,324
Isn't the rake to make business prosper.

30
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:31,124
Huh? Well...

31
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:35,324
You see, Ran has a karate competition coming up, right?

32
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:39,424
Right, I'm getting one to help me win again.

33
00:03:39,424 --> 00:03:42,324
Does the rake sold at the Tori no Ichi have that kind of an effect?

34
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:43,724
Yes, it does.

35
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:47,724
Long time ago, Prince Takeru Yamato who won in battle,

36
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:49,524
went to offer thanks to the shrine

37
00:03:49,524 --> 00:03:51,624
on the day of the rooster in November

38
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:55,324
and hooked his weapon on the pine tree of the shrine.

39
00:03:55,324 --> 00:03:56,524
That was the start of what became

40
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:58,124
to be known as the Big Rooster Festival.

41
00:03:58,124 --> 00:04:00,024
The market that was set up on the day of that festival

42
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:01,624
became the Tori no Ichi.

43
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:05,124
Wow, Conan, you sure know a lot.

44
00:04:05,124 --> 00:04:07,724
There are other stories of stars starting to shine

45
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:09,324
on the day of the rooster in November

46
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:11,924
and Bodhisattva appearing.

47
00:04:11,924 --> 00:04:13,324
There are yet various other stories that refer to the origin

48
00:04:13,324 --> 00:04:14,824
of the Tori no Ichi as being the harvest festival

49
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:16,624
of the farmers and so forth.

50
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,624
Thus, the rake became somewhat

51
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:20,224
of a lucky charm for winning battles,

52
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:23,824
good fortune and prosperous business.

53
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:26,424
And, you saw all that on TV, right?

54
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:29,824
Oh, yeah, on the evening news.

55
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:32,524
Ran!

56
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:35,124
I found it, here it is!

57
00:04:36,324 --> 00:04:39,324
The thing that Ranburi Shrine is known for

58
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:42,324
Lovely oracle!

59
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:46,524
It's an oracle that appears only during Tori no Ichi every year.

60
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:49,324
It tells you exactly what type of girl

61
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:51,324
for the boy that you like thinks is ideal for him!

62
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,024
Sonoko, you're taking it too seriously.

63
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:54,924
An oracle is just an oracle after all, you know.

64
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:56,324
Don't you know?

65
00:04:56,324 --> 00:04:58,924
Sawako of class C did exactly as the oracle said

66
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,924
and confessed her feelings, and it turned out just great!

67
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:03,624
What? Really?

68
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:07,124
What're they doing?

69
00:05:07,124 --> 00:05:09,124
Beats me.

70
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:11,824
Okay, I got my oracle.

71
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:18,424
So I wonder what Kyogoku's ideal type of girl is?

72
00:05:18,424 --> 00:05:21,524
Shinichi's ideal type is...

73
00:05:21,524 --> 00:05:24,824
Come to think of it, Shinichi said before that...

74
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:29,724
I have things that I want to ask about and say, too.

75
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:33,924
So, wait, okay?

76
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:37,724
Shinichi.

77
00:05:39,224 --> 00:05:43,024
According to my deduction, the stuff you want to ask me

78
00:05:43,024 --> 00:05:47,224
is probably the same thing I want to ask you about too.

79
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,624
Do you know, Shinichi?

80
00:06:00,624 --> 00:06:05,224
I want to ask you if you care for me or not.

81
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:09,024
If your question is the same as mine,

82
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:12,524
is it possible...

83
00:06:12,524 --> 00:06:15,824
Oh my god, just as I thought.

84
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:21,424
Aren't you going to open it, Ran?

85
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:24,324
No, I'll look at it alone when I get home.

86
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:25,924
No way!

87
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:27,424
Hey, wait.

88
00:06:27,424 --> 00:06:28,924
Well...

89
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:31,924
Let's see what Shinichi's ideal type is.

90
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,524
In order to capture that heart of a nervous

91
00:06:33,524 --> 00:06:35,424
and old-fashioned type like him.

92
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:37,524
It's best to be a Japanese woman with all the traditional graces.

93
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:41,024
Tomboys and girls that prefer flashy fashion are a no-no!

94
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:44,524
Stay graceful and refined.

95
00:06:44,524 --> 00:06:47,824
It will surely bring you closer together.

96
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,224
It says.

97
00:06:49,224 --> 00:06:52,424
I wonder if it's really true, though?

98
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:54,824
About him being the nervous type and old-fashioned?

99
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:58,624
Well, Shinichi is very attentive to details

100
00:06:58,624 --> 00:07:01,324
so I guess you could say he's the nervous type.

101
00:07:01,324 --> 00:07:02,624
I guess so.

102
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:05,224
He's really not interested in fashion or anything like that,

103
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,624
so maybe he is the old-fashioned type after all?

104
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:11,024
Oh my, madam, you casually admitted, didn't you?

105
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:13,224
That you like Shinichi.

106
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,724
No! I'm just...

107
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:18,724
Sure, sure! You can go on and confirm later

108
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:22,624
what your detective lover boy's ideal type is.

109
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:26,324
I'm going to the ladies room!

110
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:32,624
Hey... Thief!

111
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:35,624
Ran! Nab him!

112
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:42,524
Acting tomboy is a no-no.

113
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:50,624
Come on.

114
00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:54,624
You should've just beat that guy up like usual with your karate.

115
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:56,324
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:59,324
Well, so long as you're not hurt, Ran, it's okay.

117
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:02,824
There wasn't anything all that valuable in that bag anyway.

118
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:05,924
What happened? What is going on?

119
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:08,024
A purse snatcher, purse snatcher!

120
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:11,624
The strap of my bag was cut off with a knife and my bag was stolen.

121
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:15,124
The culprit was wearing a mask.

122
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:16,124
A mask?

123
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:18,724
Yep. The mask of a funny face.

124
00:08:18,724 --> 00:08:20,724
The mask of a funny face?

125
00:08:20,724 --> 00:08:23,424
I saw it on the news last week.

126
00:08:24,424 --> 00:08:28,324
The rooster man has struck again at the Tori no Ichi.

127
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:32,024
In succession to the Ichi no Tori that was held at the Sundei Shrine,

128
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:35,324
he struck again yesterday at the Ni no Tori

129
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:36,724
that was held at the Ranburi Shrine,

130
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,124
wearing the mask of a funny face.

131
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:40,324
The visitors at the shrine were struck one

132
00:08:40,324 --> 00:08:42,824
after another by this purse snatcher.

133
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:44,824
The Rooster Man was given name

134
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,524
from his appearances at Rooster Festivals

135
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:50,024
and his cocky thieving acts

136
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:52,324
who is thought to strike elsewhere again.

137
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,524
The police plan on increasing the number officers

138
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:56,824
dispatched in preparation for the San no Tori festival

139
00:08:56,824 --> 00:08:59,724
that is coming up at the end of this month.

140
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:03,024
But there are nearly 30 shrines

141
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:04,124
that are holding the Tori no Ichi

142
00:09:04,124 --> 00:09:06,524
just in the Tokyo area, you know.

143
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:08,024
If within the entire Kanto district,

144
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:09,424
it would add up to no less than 50.

145
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,024
Can they really arrest him?

146
00:09:11,024 --> 00:09:14,024
But, Sonoko was saying

147
00:09:14,024 --> 00:09:15,424
that she's determined to go to the next Tori no Ichi

148
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:17,724
that'll be held at Ranburi Shrine

149
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,124
because she wants to take revenge!

150
00:09:21,524 --> 00:09:24,824
How can you be so sure that he'll appear again at that shrine?

151
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:27,924
Beats me. She did sound confident, though.

152
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:29,724
Maybe she's planning on outwitting him

153
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:31,724
and thinks that he'll appear there again?

154
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:33,424
Well, he could go for the general notion

155
00:09:33,424 --> 00:09:35,724
that a culprit never appears a second time

156
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:38,724
in a place that he has already struck once.

157
00:09:38,724 --> 00:09:41,324
Then, why don't you guys go on your own!

158
00:09:41,324 --> 00:09:44,324
I'm not going because it's too troublesome.

159
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:49,224
I guess it's tough to get hot over a Rooster Man.

160
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:52,424
"Third Rooster Day"

161
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:57,524
What's the matter, Ran?

162
00:09:57,524 --> 00:09:59,724
It's unusual for you to be wearing a skirt?

163
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,324
Oh, it's just that

164
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:04,224
I figured this would be more appropriate

165
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:06,824
because it's cold today.

166
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:08,724
Oh, talk for yourself, Sonoko.

167
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:11,424
You're dressed more subdued than usual too, aren't you?

168
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:14,224
Oh? Well, at any rate.

169
00:10:14,224 --> 00:10:18,224
Let's go take revenge!

170
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:21,524
But, do you know where the Rooster Man is?

171
00:10:21,524 --> 00:10:24,824
No! Let's go pick out an oracle again!

172
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,824
The revenge you're referring is the oracle?

173
00:10:28,824 --> 00:10:30,624
Lovely Oracle?

174
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:33,624
I'm going to pick out a good one this time!

175
00:10:33,624 --> 00:10:36,724
The oracle is meaningless that way.

176
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:42,524
It's the Rooster Man! He's appeared again!

177
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:45,524
-What? -Did he really appear?

178
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:50,424
What's with that knapsack?

179
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:52,124
It's the Rooster Man's.

180
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:55,724
The Rooster Man threw it at the guys that went after him.

181
00:10:55,724 --> 00:10:58,324
And, which way did the Rooster Man go?

182
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,424
He went running towards the park on the other side.

183
00:11:07,224 --> 00:11:09,524
Hey, Conan?

184
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:13,224
Is there anything in here that was taken from you, Sonoko?

185
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:17,124
This is my bag!

186
00:11:17,124 --> 00:11:20,124
So, he's the culprit himself and not somebody that copied him.

187
00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:25,124
There's blood on the shoulder strap of the knapsack.

188
00:11:25,124 --> 00:11:28,824
Uh, which way did Rooster Man come fleeing from?

189
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:30,424
Yeah.

190
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:34,024
See, where there are a crowd of people from around there.

191
00:11:40,524 --> 00:11:43,424
Hey, are you okay? Get a hold of yourself.

192
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:45,824
I'll get an ambulance right away.

193
00:11:45,824 --> 00:11:48,824
Uh, was he attacked by Rooster Man?

194
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:51,224
Yeah. I heard a groan,

195
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:53,424
so I looked in that direction

196
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:55,924
and saw a person wearing a mask of a funny face

197
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,524
distancing away fleeing so.

198
00:11:58,524 --> 00:12:01,924
Rooster Man probably tried to get away with this man's belongings

199
00:12:01,924 --> 00:12:04,824
and stabbed him because he resisted.

200
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,624
It's not Rooster Man.

201
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:13,224
It's a monkey.

202
00:12:13,224 --> 00:12:14,324
Monkey?

203
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:16,324
Hey, hey, just what does that mean?

204
00:12:16,324 --> 00:12:18,324
What do you mean by monkey?

205
00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:21,124
Weren't you stabbed by Rooster Man?

206
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:26,124
He... he's trying to say something.

207
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:28,524
But his voice...

208
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,724
9?

209
00:12:41,324 --> 00:12:43,224
Hey, get a hold of yourself!

210
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:45,324
Not Rooster but Monkey.

211
00:12:45,324 --> 00:12:48,624
9. What on earth does it mean?

212
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:50,724
9 monkeys?

213
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:54,324
What did he wants to say?

214
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:01,912
I see.

215
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:05,012
So, it's a play on words tori otoko-Rooster Man and mono tori-thief.

216
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:06,912
That's why he's called Rooster Man.

217
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:10,712
But, he's gone a bit too far this time,

218
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:12,912
trying to take the life of another.

219
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:17,412
We've identified the victim who was attacked by Rooster Man.

220
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:21,612
He is Mr. Shiro Masuko who resides in Haidocho, age 21.

221
00:13:21,612 --> 00:13:23,112
A university student who is studying

222
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:25,512
to pursue literature at Tohoto University.

223
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:30,112
Oh, I hear the victim was taken to the hospital,

224
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:31,612
but did he regain consciousness?

225
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:33,112
Oh, no.

226
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,512
The bag of that university student

227
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:37,212
was also found in the knapsack,

228
00:13:37,212 --> 00:13:40,212
and we verified his identity from his driver's license that was inside.

229
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:43,012
And, how's the university student doing?

230
00:13:43,012 --> 00:13:45,112
Fortunately, his stab wound is shallow

231
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:46,612
but he's passed out

232
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:50,312
from the pain of his wound and from shock.

233
00:13:50,312 --> 00:13:51,312
The doctor says that

234
00:13:51,312 --> 00:13:54,312
he should be regaining consciousness in a little while.

235
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:59,212
And? What brings you all here?

236
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:01,212
To take revenge, revenge!

237
00:14:01,212 --> 00:14:03,912
The other day, Sonoko's bag was snatched by the Rooster Man

238
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:06,912
at the Ni no Tori that was held at this shrine.

239
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:10,512
That's why we were staking out here at the Ranburi Shrine!

240
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:14,012
I deduced that he'd try to outwit everyone and reappear here.

241
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:18,712
No, you came to pick out another oracle, didn't you?

242
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:23,512
Of course. I already got my bag from Rooster Man's bag.

243
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:28,512
Oh, no. That's evidence, so we can't give it back to you yet.

244
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:32,212
So, it's just not somebody imitating the culprit, then.

245
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:35,612
No. We're having victims from both Ichi no Tori

246
00:14:35,612 --> 00:14:38,312
and Ni no Tori come here to confirm things.

247
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:41,612
But, it seems that the culprit who appeared here at San no Tori

248
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:43,412
is also the same person as the one who appeared at the other two shrines.

249
00:14:43,412 --> 00:14:45,812
But, the only clue we have is that the culprit

250
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:48,312
was wearing the mask of a funny face.

251
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:50,612
There are other clues!

252
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:52,712
When everybody was saying that

253
00:14:52,712 --> 00:14:55,612
it seemed like the victim was stabbed by Rooster Man,

254
00:14:55,612 --> 00:14:58,712
the victim said it wasn't a rooster, but rather a monkey.

255
00:14:58,712 --> 00:14:59,712
A monkey?

256
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:03,512
And he also showed 9 fingers like this.

257
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:04,812
So, the culprit could be someone

258
00:15:04,812 --> 00:15:07,712
having something to do with a monkey and the number 9.

259
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:09,212
Monkey and the number 9?

260
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:10,712
9 monkeys.

261
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:13,712
9 (Kyu). Monkey(saru).

262
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,712
Kusaru (rotten)?

263
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:18,012
Maybe the culprit is rotting.

264
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:21,312
I'm sure that he's rotten to the gut.

265
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:23,812
This is no time to be playing with words.

266
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:26,412
Inspector, we arrested Rooster Man!

267
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:28,012
Really?

268
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:31,512
Oh, but there're three of them.

269
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:33,712
Three of them?

270
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:36,612
The people who went after Rooster Man

271
00:15:36,612 --> 00:15:39,812
saw him run inside the toilet

272
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:42,412
and reported it to the police.

273
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:48,712
So, when you got there after getting the report,

274
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:52,212
the onlookers were all around the toilet.

275
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:56,112
And, when you called out to tell the man to come out of the toilet,

276
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:59,112
the ones who came out were those three men?

277
00:15:59,112 --> 00:16:02,812
Yes, sir. According to eye-witness reports,

278
00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:07,112
it's certain that Rooster Man ran into the men's room.

279
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:08,912
After the three were taken out,

280
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:11,112
we checked inside the toilet

281
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:13,512
and found a knife, down jacket

282
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:18,012
and mask of a funny face stained with blood disposed of inside.

283
00:16:18,012 --> 00:16:22,112
I think it is unmistakable that Rooster Man went into this toilet!

284
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:23,212
Yes.

285
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:25,712
Besides, according to the onlookers,

286
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:27,412
everyone was scared that no one entered the toilet

287
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:30,512
until we arrived at the scene,

288
00:16:30,512 --> 00:16:33,512
so I think those three are the only ones who could be Rooster Man.

289
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:35,412
I see.

290
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:40,712
Okay, I'd like to talk to each of you one by one.

291
00:16:40,712 --> 00:16:44,912
Please give me your name and your purpose for coming here.

292
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:47,612
"Tatsuo Hino (45)" -My name is Tatsuo Hino.

293
00:16:47,612 --> 00:16:50,612
After buying this rake at Tori no Ichi,

294
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:54,412
I happened to stop over at the restroom here, before heading home.

295
00:16:54,412 --> 00:16:57,512
I've been having stomach trouble lately.

296
00:16:57,512 --> 00:16:59,612
See, I even have medicine for it on me, too.

297
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:01,912
You're Rooster Man, aren't you?

298
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:04,612
I mean, you look just like a monkey!

299
00:17:04,612 --> 00:17:07,312
It's... it's true that he resembles a monkey.

300
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:08,212
Yes.

301
00:17:08,212 --> 00:17:12,212
Hey, hey, you're looking not for a monkey, but Rooster Man, aren't you?

302
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:14,412
The person who was stabbed said...

303
00:17:14,412 --> 00:17:16,512
It wasn't a rooster but a monkey.

304
00:17:18,012 --> 00:17:20,712
But, I don't think he was referring to the face.

305
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:23,812
Rooster Man was wearing the mask of a funny face,

306
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:25,812
so he couldn't have seen the face, right?

307
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:28,512
Right.

308
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:32,212
I... I came here not to come to the Tori no Ichi,

309
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:36,312
but rather to communicate with other gamers.

310
00:17:36,312 --> 00:17:38,212
Communicate with other gamers?

311
00:17:38,212 --> 00:17:40,612
We exchange items and maps that are used in games

312
00:17:40,612 --> 00:17:42,612
through network communication.

313
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:46,312
Since a lot of people come to the Tori no Ichi,

314
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:49,712
I figured I could communicate with many people here.

315
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:53,512
See, I got to communicate with 10 people today.

316
00:17:53,512 --> 00:17:56,512
I confirmed that in the restroom.

317
00:17:56,512 --> 00:18:00,112
Okay, and what's your name?

318
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,612
We haven't gotten it from you yet, have we?

319
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:06,112
"Hisami Sarukawa (20)" -Hisami Sarukawa.

320
00:18:06,112 --> 00:18:07,712
Saru (monkey). Saru (monkey)!

321
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,112
So, you're Rooster Man!

322
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:10,212
Sonoko!

323
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:13,912
But, I was never called "Saru"!

324
00:18:13,912 --> 00:18:15,912
My name is Hisami, so my nickname is taken

325
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:18,812
from the kanji character of my name "Kyu", so I'm called Kyu-chan.

326
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:20,712
-Kyu? -What?

327
00:18:20,712 --> 00:18:24,112
The victim indicated just before passing out,

328
00:18:24,112 --> 00:18:26,712
the number 9 along with the word monkey!

329
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:31,712
But, I don't think the victim would know the snatcher's name.

330
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:34,212
True.

331
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:37,312
"Shinji Mizunoe (32)" -I'm Shinji Mizunoe.

332
00:18:37,312 --> 00:18:39,112
I stopped by at the restroom on my way

333
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:43,312
to buying a rake for the company that I work for.

334
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:46,412
Because I couldn't buy one at Ni no Tori.

335
00:18:46,412 --> 00:18:50,212
I actually went to buy one during Ichi no Tori,

336
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,712
but before I got to buy it, my bag with my wallet inside

337
00:18:52,712 --> 00:18:54,612
was snatched from me by Rooster Man.

338
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:57,912
So, you were also victimized by Rooster Man?

339
00:18:57,912 --> 00:19:01,212
Yes, sir. Thanks to him, all I get to eat recently is lunch

340
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:04,712
bought at convenience stores, because I don't have money.

341
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:09,212
The same with today. I'm sure I've got the receipt.

342
00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:12,312
I wonder where I put the receipt?

343
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:15,212
We can figure out the victims pretty quickly.

344
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:18,012
Yes, sir. If we check inside the knapsack of Rooster Man,

345
00:19:18,012 --> 00:19:19,012
it's very likely that...

346
00:19:19,012 --> 00:19:20,812
Is there anything in the bag that was taken from you

347
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:24,112
that will prove that it belongs to you?

348
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:27,012
Like a driver's license or I.D.?

349
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:31,312
I think that a bank book in my name, is inside.

350
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:33,412
You can check the kanji character of my name

351
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:37,012
that's written "Shin". Please see for yourself.

352
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:39,112
Okay. Check it right away.

353
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,612
Yes, sir.

354
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:45,212
You don't seem to have anything to do with monkey or the number 9.

355
00:19:45,212 --> 00:19:48,612
I'm a monkey in animal fortune telling though.

356
00:19:48,612 --> 00:19:51,212
Animal fortune telling?

357
00:19:51,212 --> 00:19:55,012
Outdated mean, how long ago was that stuff popular.

358
00:19:57,512 --> 00:20:01,712
By the way, I hear that you two were also victims at the Ni no Tori,

359
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:04,812
but what rake did you come to buy?

360
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:07,012
Well...

361
00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:10,812
They came to pick the Lovely oracle.

362
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:13,912
Lovely oracle? What is that?

363
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:18,012
It's an oracle that is offered every year during Tori no Ichi.

364
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:21,412
I have it on me now.

365
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:26,212
There's a button inside together with coins.

366
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:28,612
Where did I get this?

367
00:20:28,612 --> 00:20:31,312
Ran! Nab him!

368
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:33,912
What's the matter?

369
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:36,912
It's a purse snatcher! A snatcher!

370
00:20:36,912 --> 00:20:40,312
This could be the button from Rooster Man's clothes!

371
00:20:40,312 --> 00:20:41,512
What?

372
00:20:41,512 --> 00:20:44,512
Well, I bumped into Rooster Man.

373
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:46,712
I'm sure that I picked it up at that time

374
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,912
when I was picking up the coins and put it in my coin purse.

375
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:53,212
But, it could've been on the ground to begin with, right?

376
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:57,112
But, if it's what you say it is, it could be very important proof.

377
00:20:57,112 --> 00:20:59,812
If among the three, there is one

378
00:20:59,812 --> 00:21:02,712
that has clothes on that's missing the same button,

379
00:21:02,712 --> 00:21:05,912
then he's unmistakably Rooster Man!

380
00:21:05,912 --> 00:21:10,612
We would like to check inside your house immediately,

381
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:11,812
would that be okay?

382
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,212
No, it's fine with me.

383
00:21:14,212 --> 00:21:17,212
If you explain the situation to mom, it's okay.

384
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:19,512
If that's going to clear me from being a suspect,

385
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,312
I don't mind.

386
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:24,512
Then, let's take a picture of this button right away

387
00:21:24,512 --> 00:21:26,112
and pass it out to the investigators.

388
00:21:26,112 --> 00:21:27,612
Have them confirm it immediately.

389
00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:29,612
Yes, sir.

390
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:38,612
Strange. The fact that Ran picked up a button that may be

391
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:43,312
the Rooster Man's was found out of the blue just now.

392
00:21:43,312 --> 00:21:47,512
And yet, those three don't seem to bothered what so ever.

393
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:51,712
Rooster Man appears at Tori no Ichi,

394
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:53,412
wears the mask of a funny face,

395
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,812
then steals the bags and belongings of others.

396
00:21:54,812 --> 00:21:57,212
In other words, he's a purse snatcher.

397
00:21:57,212 --> 00:22:01,212
He didn't hurt anyone today,

398
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:03,412
but on the night of San no Tori,

399
00:22:03,412 --> 00:22:05,712
he ended up stabbing university student, Mr. Shiro Masuko

400
00:22:05,712 --> 00:22:09,912
with a knife and wounded him seriously.

401
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,312
In the knapsack that Rooster Man left behind,

402
00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:14,812
the things of the people he stole from were inside.

403
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:17,312
Therefore, he didn't seem to be a copy cat either.

404
00:22:17,312 --> 00:22:20,112
And just before Mr. Masuko passed out,

405
00:22:20,112 --> 00:22:23,812
he left behind the messages "monkey" and the number "9".

406
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:27,812
What on earth do they mean?

407
00:22:27,812 --> 00:22:30,112
Is Rooster Man really among the three people

408
00:22:30,112 --> 00:22:33,112
who are thought to be suspects?

409
00:22:33,112 --> 00:22:37,712
It's not going to be all that simple to solve this case.

410
00:23:59,912 --> 00:24:03,412
"Next Episode" -The victim knew the culprit.

411
00:24:03,412 --> 00:24:05,712
That's why it was the 9th monkey.

412
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:09,012
What? You know who Rooster Man is?

413
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:12,512
You mean you figured out what the "monkey" and "9" means?

414
00:24:17,212 --> 00:24:18,212
Something's wrong!

415
00:24:18,212 --> 00:24:21,512
Ran's not answering her phone from some time ago.

416
00:24:24,512 --> 00:24:25,912
Next Conan,

417
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:29,812
"The Tori's Pledge of Monkey and Rake (Part 2)"

418
00:24:45,612 --> 00:24:47,912
Next Conan's Hint:

419
00:24:47,912 --> 00:24:49,912
"Oracle"

420
00:24:49,912 --> 00:24:51,212
Maybe I'll go pick out an oracle too.

421
00:24:51,212 --> 00:24:53,012
It's unlucky for those who are in love, though!

422
00:24:53,012 --> 00:24:54,812
I'll never pick an unlucky one up!
