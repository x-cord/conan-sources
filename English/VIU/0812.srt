1
00:00:00,695 --> 00:00:01,894
We came on a sightseeing tour

2
00:00:01,895 --> 00:00:05,394
to the old Battle of Kawanakajima at Nagano Prefecture.

3
00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:06,994
We coincidentally ran into Inspector Kansuke Yamato

4
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:07,995
and other Nagano Prefectural Police officers

5
00:00:07,996 --> 00:00:09,294
and they had taken us around.

6
00:00:09,295 --> 00:00:11,794
Just as we were about to arrive at the Chikuma River,

7
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:14,595
we found the head of a person come drifting along the river.

8
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:19,794
The head that had the mark of a woodpecker footprint on its forehead

9
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:23,094
belonged to Squad Chief Takeda of the Nagano Prefectural Police.

10
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:26,094
Furthermore, another officer of the Takeda Squad,

11
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:31,394
Police Lieutenant Kano was also found hung to death at his residence.

12
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:36,395
Likewise, Police Sergeant Akiyama of the Takeda Squad was also killed.

13
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:39,494
The perpetrator that is indicated by the various evidence

14
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:41,094
that comes up all point to...

15
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:42,594
"Kansuke Yamato"

16
00:00:42,595 --> 00:00:45,394
Kansuke's the one who sent the mail?

17
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:48,094
I'm calling a search out for him as a murder suspect!

18
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:52,194
But Inspector Yamato would never commit murder!

19
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:55,394
We should prioritize justice over emotions right now.

20
00:00:55,395 --> 00:00:58,494
If we let him get away, we may regret it.

21
00:00:58,495 --> 00:01:00,594
Okay. We'll set up checkpoints immediately

22
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:03,194
and get custody of Yamato at all costs.

23
00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:06,094
Don't go easy on him just because you know him.

24
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:10,595
Remember that he's a serial killer that killed three officers in a row!

25
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:15,894
Investigation First Section Chief Kuroda,

26
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:18,994
we got a tip just now that a man resembling Yamato was witnessed.

27
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:22,994
I want to go and confirm it, but there's no car available.

28
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:24,094
Oh, good timing.

29
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:26,894
Morofushi, will you lend me your car?

30
00:01:26,895 --> 00:01:29,294
No. I don't think so.

31
00:01:29,295 --> 00:01:31,394
Is there a problem?

32
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:34,894
No. Mr. Saegusa's driving is a bit rough, you see.

33
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,894
-Morofushi. -Yes, sir.

34
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:39,694
This is an emergency. Let him use it.

35
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:41,094
It's an order.

36
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:42,095
Yes, sir.

37
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:43,394
Go ahead.

38
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,694
Sorry. Thanks.

39
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:47,594
If the tip's credible, report back immediately!

40
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:48,795
Roger!

41
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:53,894
I'm Bishamonten.

42
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:56,694
I shall destroy the woodpeckers.

43
00:01:56,695 --> 00:01:58,595
I'm the God of War!

44
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:11,494
"Flow forward like the river, Yamato"

45
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:14,894
"Flow forward like the river".

46
00:02:14,895 --> 00:02:16,095
Kansuke.

47
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:19,394
What's the matter?

48
00:02:19,395 --> 00:02:20,594
Nothing.

49
00:02:20,595 --> 00:02:23,094
It's mail from Kansuke.

50
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:25,494
What? This is...

51
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:27,494
Morofushi, may I have a word with you?

52
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:28,495
Yes, sir.

53
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:31,094
Excuse me.

54
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:33,594
Kansuke. Why?

55
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:36,194
Officer Yui.

56
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:37,195
What?

57
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:42,394
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

58
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,594
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

59
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:46,594
The incidents that revolve around Shingen

60
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:48,994
come together in an unexpected fashion.

61
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:50,494
He sees through the one and only truth.

62
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:52,294
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

63
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:54,295
His name is Detective Conan!

64
00:04:35,993 --> 00:04:41,093
"The Darkness of the Prefectural Police (Part 3)"

65
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:49,692
Darn it.

66
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:52,292
That jerk Yamato.

67
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,892
Since a search warrant's been issued,

68
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,892
I know I can make it off on my own,

69
00:04:55,893 --> 00:04:58,392
so borrow Morofushi's car that can drive at high speed

70
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:01,492
and come pick me up at the mountain shack in Mount Saijo

71
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:04,292
and get me out of bounds of the prefecture.

72
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:08,392
I'm going to expose X!

73
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:11,193
How do you know about X?

74
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:26,993
I'm Bishamonten.

75
00:05:29,593 --> 00:05:31,693
I shall destroy the woodpeckers.

76
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:41,493
I'm the God of War!

77
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:45,592
X?

78
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:49,092
You mean the Woodpeckers Club was called X?

79
00:05:49,093 --> 00:05:51,792
Yep. Taking into consideration what Officer Yui was saying,

80
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:53,992
it's most likely so.

81
00:05:53,993 --> 00:05:56,592
The footprints of woodpeckers form and X too.

82
00:05:56,593 --> 00:05:58,792
But, wasn't The Woodpeckers Club

83
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:02,992
a mysterious group that was supposed to be in the NPD?

84
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:03,993
Right!

85
00:06:03,994 --> 00:06:05,592
The people who were killed

86
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:08,592
belonged to that Woodpeckers Club!

87
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:09,593
What?

88
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:12,192
But Officer Yui was saying a while ago that.

89
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:14,292
The people who were murdered this time

90
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:17,292
were those who had names that resembled the generals

91
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,392
who died in the Battle of Kawanakajima,

92
00:06:19,393 --> 00:06:22,892
and it'd be impossible to form a group with people who died in battle.

93
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:27,092
Moreover, she told me that the one who told her that was you, Conan.

94
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:29,392
That's what I thought at that time.

95
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:33,592
I didn't know the Woodpecker Society was called X.

96
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,192
So what if it's called X?

97
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:39,692
X is the 24th letter of the alphabet.

98
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:42,192
The number 24 when used with Takeda

99
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,693
refers to the 24 Takeda Generals who served Shingen Takeda!

100
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:49,092
The 24 Generals of Shingen Takeda.

101
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:52,693
Right. The first one whose head was cut off and murdered...

102
00:06:55,993 --> 00:06:59,292
Chief Takeda, whose name was similar to Shingen's younger brother,

103
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,992
Nobushinge Takeda.

104
00:07:00,993 --> 00:07:04,893
The next one who was strangled and hung from the ceiling...

105
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:12,192
Lieutenant Shoji Kano's former surname was Tsuchiya,

106
00:07:12,193 --> 00:07:15,492
so he was Shingen's right hand man, Masatsugu Tsuchiya.

107
00:07:15,493 --> 00:07:18,292
And the one who fell off the cliff a while ago with his head hooked

108
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:20,393
on to the car with a rope...

109
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:26,392
Police Sergeant Shinsuke Akiyama was Nobutomo Akiyama

110
00:07:26,393 --> 00:07:29,192
who persuaded the senior vassals of Takeda

111
00:07:29,193 --> 00:07:33,492
who were against alliance with Nobunaga Oda

112
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:35,792
Inspector Morofushi said it's possible

113
00:07:35,793 --> 00:07:37,392
that they were gathering people

114
00:07:37,393 --> 00:07:40,392
with names similar to the 24 generals of Takeda to join them.

115
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:44,392
-Really? -So, the next target is probably...

116
00:07:44,393 --> 00:07:46,592
Inspector Mamoru Saegusa whose name resembles Yoritomo Saegusa,

117
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:51,492
the samurai who was in command of Takeda's foot soldiers.

118
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:52,992
Hey, hold it there.

119
00:07:52,993 --> 00:07:55,792
If it's the 24 Generals of Takeda,

120
00:07:55,793 --> 00:07:57,492
then most naturally the strategist of the Takeda force,

121
00:07:57,493 --> 00:07:59,892
Kansuke Yamamoto is also included, right?

122
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:04,092
Yep! That's why Lieutenant Kano made that remark at the shrine.

123
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:07,292
I think you're the perfect fit for our squad.

124
00:08:07,293 --> 00:08:08,692
Remember?

125
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:13,392
Which means the entire Takeda Squad belonged to the Woodpecker Society.

126
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:18,392
But didn't Inspector Saegusa leave to go somewhere?

127
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:22,192
Yep. I think he was called out by the perpetrator.

128
00:08:22,193 --> 00:08:25,292
And? Who's the perpetrator?

129
00:08:25,293 --> 00:08:26,693
Well...

130
00:08:31,393 --> 00:08:32,493
Why?

131
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:41,892
That's because...

132
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:43,093
You're...

133
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:53,592
Don't tell me Inspector Yamato...

134
00:08:53,593 --> 00:08:54,993
Kansuke.

135
00:09:00,393 --> 00:09:03,292
Hey! I came to pick you up as you told me to.

136
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,493
Yamato?

137
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:11,092
Right, Officer of the First Investigation Division of NPD.

138
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,692
Kansuke.

139
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:14,593
Hey, Yamato.

140
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,093
Takeda Squad.

141
00:09:29,593 --> 00:09:32,592
Police Sergeant Shinsuke Akiyama.

142
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:35,792
-What? -What?

143
00:09:35,793 --> 00:09:39,092
-Sergeant Akiyama's the perpetrator? -Sergeant Akiyama's the perpetrator?

144
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:43,792
But, didn't you say that Sergeant Akiyama fell off the cliff car and all?

145
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:47,892
Yeah, on his way down his body got stuck on the branch of a tree

146
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:49,692
and his head was cut off by the rope that was wrapped around his neck

147
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:51,792
and went falling down the cliff!

148
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:54,092
But, that head was fake!

149
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,892
I'm sure he used the mannequin's head from his parents' beauty salon,

150
00:09:57,893 --> 00:10:00,392
that is used to practice hair cuts

151
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:02,692
and cut the hair that is similar his hair style,

152
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:04,892
put the hood of his parker on it and took it with him.

153
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:08,192
I think he threw the fake blood and fake head out of the hook

154
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:10,092
as he went falling.

155
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:13,092
But the rope that was hooked onto the car

156
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:15,192
was wrapped around his neck, right?

157
00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:20,392
He was just holding the criss-crossed rope in front of his neck.

158
00:10:20,393 --> 00:10:23,192
So, once you let it go it becomes undone easily.

159
00:10:23,193 --> 00:10:26,792
And by setting up a headless corpse wearing his clothes

160
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,092
on the tree beforehand,

161
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:30,692
then dangle from a lifeline tied onto it,

162
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:32,292
the people at the top of the cliff wouldn't be able to see

163
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:34,592
because the tree would be in the way.

164
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:38,292
So it'd look as if his head was cut off and fall off the cliff.

165
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:40,692
A headless corpse?

166
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:42,692
Chief Takeda's body was used.

167
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:46,092
He probably used it because they both had similar physique.

168
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:49,092
So the place where Chief Takeda got his head cut off

169
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:51,092
was at Mount Saijo.

170
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:54,392
Then... What about the burnt body that was found under the bridge?

171
00:10:54,393 --> 00:10:57,992
That was probably the body of the wanted robber that was on the run.

172
00:10:57,993 --> 00:11:00,492
By cutting off the toe of Chief Takeda's leg

173
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,392
and leaving that part behind as if it had been spared being burned,

174
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:06,392
you can even deceive the DNA test.

175
00:11:06,393 --> 00:11:08,192
The head of the robber probably

176
00:11:08,193 --> 00:11:11,292
in the car that fell over the cliff and exploded.

177
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:13,092
Once it's burned and becomes a skull,

178
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:16,192
everybody would think that the head belongs to Sergeant Akiyama.

179
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:17,992
Come to think of it...

180
00:11:17,993 --> 00:11:20,792
Officer Yui said that Sergeant Akiyama seems to have been asked to come

181
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:22,492
by mail from Inspector Yamato.

182
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:25,492
Sergeant Akiyama set that up too.

183
00:11:25,493 --> 00:11:28,692
He text mailed his own cell phone using his first victim,

184
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:30,892
Chief Takeda's cell phone

185
00:11:30,893 --> 00:11:33,592
to make it look as if Inspector Yamato had summoned him.

186
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:37,292
Then he added Inspector Yamato's number to his blocked contacts,

187
00:11:37,293 --> 00:11:41,992
to make it look like he was ensuring the message wouldn't be erased.

188
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:46,692
He did all this to frame Inspector Yamato up as the perpetrator.

189
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:47,793
What?

190
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,692
Sergeant Akiyama also set it up

191
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:55,092
so that Inspector Yamato's fingerprints would be detected from the rope

192
00:11:55,093 --> 00:11:57,492
that was wrapped around Lieutenant Kano

193
00:11:57,493 --> 00:11:59,892
who was hung from the ceiling,

194
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:05,192
Assistant Inspector was hung from two loops of roped connected like this,

195
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:08,992
and Inspector Yamato touched the top loop when he brought the body down.

196
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:13,092
But if you grab the loop by the neck and pull it.

197
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:17,792
See, the both of the loops switch place in the wink of an eye, right?

198
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:19,892
Yeah, amazing!

199
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:21,592
Sergeant Akiyama used this trick

200
00:12:21,593 --> 00:12:25,292
to switched the part of the rope that Inspector Yamato touched

201
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:27,692
to the rope that was wrapped around the neck.

202
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:29,692
He rang Lieutenant Kano's cell phone

203
00:12:29,693 --> 00:12:33,492
while everyone's attention was distracted.

204
00:12:33,493 --> 00:12:35,192
He also provoked Inspector Yamato and Inspector Morofushi

205
00:12:35,193 --> 00:12:38,392
to get into an argument for the same reason!

206
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:40,192
Unless Inspector Yamato got angry

207
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,092
and started investigations on his own,

208
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:44,392
Sergeant Akiyama wouldn't have been able to frame him.

209
00:12:44,393 --> 00:12:46,992
Since they're crosspatches,

210
00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:48,992
when you mention that they're best friends

211
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:52,292
they start bad-mouthing each other and arguing.

212
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:56,292
But weren't the two on bad terms

213
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:58,692
from even before Sergeant Akiyama said anything?

214
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:01,092
Komei, don't tell me that you...

215
00:13:01,093 --> 00:13:05,292
Like they say, even parasites inside a lion will eat their host.

216
00:13:05,293 --> 00:13:06,992
I remember them arguing like so.

217
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:10,492
That was a trap that the two had set up toward the perpetrator.

218
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:13,992
If the perpetrator were trying to frame Inspector Yamato,

219
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,392
they pretended to fall for what the perpetrator wanted them to do,

220
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:18,992
so Inspector Yamato went off to investigate on his own.

221
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:20,392
I think they did this to wait and see

222
00:13:20,393 --> 00:13:23,692
what the perpetrator was planning to do next.

223
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:25,792
Because the fact that the perpetrator was trying to frame Inspector Yamato

224
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:27,492
was obvious this morning

225
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:31,992
when a witness appeared saying that Inspector Yamato was near the bridge.

226
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:35,292
Then, the Inspector Yamato that the witness saw was...

227
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:37,592
It was probably Sergeant Akiyama wearing a hood

228
00:13:37,593 --> 00:13:40,792
and walking using the same kind of cane that Inspector Yamato had.

229
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:43,792
He was probably wearing secret boots that made him look tall.

230
00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:47,692
But if Inspector Yamato went around solely on his own,

231
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,692
it would've been just what the perpetrator wanted him to do, right?

232
00:13:50,693 --> 00:13:53,792
Because he wouldn't be able to establish an alibi.

233
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:56,192
He has a solid alibi.

234
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:59,992
Inspector Morofushi had a car camera installed,

235
00:13:59,993 --> 00:14:03,592
and a spare tire was in the backseat of his car, you know?

236
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,192
I see! The trunk of the car!

237
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:07,892
If he stayed quietly in there,

238
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:11,992
the image on the car camera would prove his alibi!

239
00:14:11,993 --> 00:14:14,092
You're amazing, Conan!

240
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:18,292
Well... Inspector Morofushi told me all this.

241
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:19,992
But hold it...

242
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:22,092
Didn't Inspector Saegusa drive off

243
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:25,993
with Inspector Morofushi's car when he was summoned?

244
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:46,251
I'm Bishamonten.

245
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,776
I shall destroy the woodpeckers.

246
00:15:01,876 --> 00:15:04,076
I'm the God of War!

247
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:17,275
I did it! I did it!

248
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:23,275
Hiding in the trunk was a clever idea, Inspector Yamato.

249
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:26,676
But I guess I was a cut above you.

250
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:32,375
So, I'm going to take the gun from your corpse

251
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:35,875
and shoot Saegusa with it

252
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:38,075
to make it look as if you both shot and killed each other.

253
00:15:38,076 --> 00:15:40,675
After burning Takeda's corpse,

254
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:43,276
I'll disappear.

255
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:48,776
Are you stupid?

256
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:59,875
There's no way I'd stay in a cramped up place like this without anything.

257
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:03,875
The riot shield of the riot squad?

258
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:05,475
You mean you used that to avoid the bullets?

259
00:16:05,476 --> 00:16:06,875
Akiyama.

260
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:11,176
I knew exactly what you're thinking!

261
00:16:12,276 --> 00:16:18,175
At the very moment that you said a witness saw somebody who looked like me

262
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:21,476
walking near the bridge this morning.

263
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:24,575
The only person who could've done that

264
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:28,975
was someone who knew that I'd never cross that bridge this morning.

265
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:32,275
In other words, somebody who knew about my friend,

266
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:34,575
who got high on drugs and shot randomly in the city nine years ago,

267
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:38,375
who was then killed by Pops Takeda

268
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:42,375
that is the bereaved family of the victim struck by a stray bullet,

269
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:49,776
who knew that I visited her grave every morning on the day that she died.

270
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,475
Right.

271
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:56,175
You're the older brother of Tsuyako Aburakawa, a middle school student

272
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:57,875
who died instantly after being shot

273
00:16:57,876 --> 00:17:00,875
in the forehead by my friend.

274
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:02,875
Shinsuke Aburakawa.

275
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:06,576
You're the suspect in this serial murder case!

276
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:09,475
You put the mark of the woodpecker's footprint

277
00:17:09,476 --> 00:17:12,975
on the foreheads of the corpses

278
00:17:12,976 --> 00:17:16,875
because your younger sister was shot in the forehead.

279
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:19,575
You deliberately made Mr. Kano aware of this

280
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:22,975
and made him go to his residence to check it out and killed him.

281
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:27,375
You tried to frame me with that rope trick of yours.

282
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:28,675
However,

283
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:33,075
I don't know what was your motive for killing Pops Takeda and the others

284
00:17:33,076 --> 00:17:35,175
so I kept an eye on you,

285
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:37,775
but after I overheard what Uehara said from inside the trunk of the car,

286
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:40,275
I got an idea.

287
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:42,675
Pops Takeda and the others stole the guns

288
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:44,375
that they confiscated from premises search,

289
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:50,575
branded them X, sold them off and were filling their pockets.

290
00:17:50,576 --> 00:17:53,375
Yes, I didn't know about it either.

291
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:54,875
Until my surname changed to Akiyama

292
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:58,775
and Chief Takeda invited me to join the Woodpecker Society.

293
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:03,275
Then, I found out that the gun that killed Tsuyako

294
00:18:03,276 --> 00:18:06,775
was one of the guns they had sold through illegal channels!

295
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:09,275
That's why I taught them a lesson.

296
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:10,875
Takeda!

297
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:12,176
Kano!

298
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:16,775
Next, it's you.

299
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:17,875
Akiyama.

300
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:20,675
You're of the same flock, Inspector Yamato.

301
00:18:20,676 --> 00:18:23,875
You're to blame for having such a stupid friend.

302
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:27,675
After I kill you, I'm killing Saegusa.

303
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:30,675
Then, I've avenged Tsuyako's death.

304
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,175
Cut it out already, Akiyama.

305
00:18:34,176 --> 00:18:37,075
You can't win.

306
00:18:37,076 --> 00:18:39,976
I wonder how long that shield will protect you.

307
00:18:44,776 --> 00:18:46,076
Akiyama.

308
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:51,675
You're totally surrounded.

309
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:53,175
Since when?

310
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:57,675
"Without making a sound, they crossed the river at night."

311
00:18:57,676 --> 00:19:01,775
Like Kenshin Uesugi who sniffed out the woodpecker strategy,

312
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:04,875
we approached you without a sound

313
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,075
and were watching you

314
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:11,675
from the time you were hanging halfway down the cliff.

315
00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:16,175
Well, we just got here about now though.

316
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:18,975
Then, about issuing a search warrant on Inspector Yamato

317
00:19:18,976 --> 00:19:21,675
and leaving the dead body behind were...

318
00:19:21,676 --> 00:19:23,475
All to catch you off guard and nail you here.

319
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:28,475
That's why we deliberately made sure you heard everything.

320
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:29,875
I think it'll be too cluttered in Morufushi's car

321
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:34,975
with the spare tire in the backseat and all.

322
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:37,175
We figured that you'd make a move

323
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,875
as soon as you found out where Yamato was.

324
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:42,775
No way.

325
00:19:42,776 --> 00:19:44,176
Nab him!

326
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:54,175
Hey, is Saegusa all right?

327
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:56,675
He's all right. He's breathing.

328
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:59,975
Okay. I guess we're going to have to give Saegusa

329
00:19:59,976 --> 00:20:02,776
a good interrogation later too, then.

330
00:20:04,276 --> 00:20:08,075
I guess I'll have to leave that up to you guys though.

331
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:09,076
What?

332
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,775
Are you all right, Kansuke?

333
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:13,776
Yeah.

334
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:15,975
I'm just fine, see.

335
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:18,675
I tell you! I was so worried about you!

336
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,675
When I heard from Conan about the situation

337
00:20:20,676 --> 00:20:25,675
and saw that ill omen mail that you sent to Inspector Morofushi, I...

338
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:29,675
You mean the one about to flow like the river?

339
00:20:29,676 --> 00:20:31,575
Those were the words of Kansuke Yamamoto

340
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:35,375
when he charged into enemy grounds, right?

341
00:20:35,376 --> 00:20:36,975
It was a joke! A joke!

342
00:20:36,976 --> 00:20:39,575
Stop nagging me.

343
00:20:39,576 --> 00:20:43,075
Are you my mother or what?

344
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,275
Geez.

345
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,775
Okay, I got it.

346
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:47,575
I won't worry about you anymore!

347
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:49,475
I'm sure you don't want a woman with an X on her marriage record

348
00:20:49,476 --> 00:20:51,076
brooding over you.

349
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:56,975
Stupid, I've got an X on my face too.

350
00:20:56,976 --> 00:20:59,975
What?

351
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:03,075
A huge mark of the footprint of a woodpecker!

352
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:04,875
Kansuke.

353
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:08,076
So well... you've got nothing to brood over.

354
00:21:13,976 --> 00:21:15,675
Come to think of it, Kansuke.

355
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:16,875
What?

356
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,475
What was the dull business you had to attend to this afternoon?

357
00:21:19,476 --> 00:21:23,875
I went to see the granny of my friend who fired at random.

358
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:26,775
Since his grave is in a remote area

359
00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:28,675
where even cell phones are not in service,

360
00:21:28,676 --> 00:21:31,675
I take her to his grave at that time every year.

361
00:21:31,676 --> 00:21:33,075
I see.

362
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:37,575
Which means he knew about it too and tried to take advantage of it.

363
00:21:37,576 --> 00:21:38,676
Yeah.

364
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:44,875
Gosh. I'm starving.

365
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:46,675
You wanted go get some noodles before going home?

366
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:48,876
No, I'll go have pasta.

367
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:19,875
I'm satisfied! I'm totally satisfied.

368
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:22,475
Dad, I think you ate too much, no?

369
00:23:22,476 --> 00:23:23,675
Don't be silly.

370
00:23:23,676 --> 00:23:25,575
One of the enjoyments of traveling

371
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:30,075
is eating local food that you can only eat there to your heart's content.

372
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,676
When it comes to Nagano...

373
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:39,676
I forgot to eat Shinshu noodles!

374
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:47,775
"Next episode"

375
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:49,675
He's looking at Amuro.

376
00:23:49,676 --> 00:23:51,975
Hey, we looked in all the shops, right?

377
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:55,075
Yes, but he's nowhere.

378
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:58,476
I'm sure that he vanished after all!

379
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:02,876
Can I help you with something?

380
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:06,976
Amuro!

381
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:13,276
Next Conan, "Darkness Creeps Upon Amuro"
