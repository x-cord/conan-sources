1
00:00:01,563 --> 00:00:03,362
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:05,562
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,563 --> 00:00:07,262
Four Porsches just like the ones those guys have.

4
00:00:07,263 --> 00:00:09,362
The case far surpasses all expectations!

5
00:00:09,363 --> 00:00:10,962
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,963 --> 00:00:12,862
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:14,963
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,979
"Four Porsches (Part 1)"

9
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:15,854
Since she came back home, she's running a fever.

10
00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:28,954
Hey, are you all right?

11
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:33,953
It's just a cold.

12
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:37,253
It's not something you have to go out of your way to come see me for.

13
00:02:37,254 --> 00:02:39,253
So much has been going on recently

14
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:41,354
that she probably just psychologically tired.

15
00:02:45,154 --> 00:02:48,353
By the way, are you okay?

16
00:02:48,354 --> 00:02:49,853
What?

17
00:02:49,854 --> 00:02:53,254
Remember the guys the other day that were tailing us?

18
00:02:54,354 --> 00:02:57,353
If they tail you back here and find this house,

19
00:02:57,354 --> 00:02:59,053
we'll get Dr. Agasa into trouble, too.

20
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:02,653
Don't worry. I wasn't tailed by anyone.

21
00:03:02,654 --> 00:03:04,854
And nobody's watching over this house either.

22
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:11,953
She should go see a doctor, but...

23
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:13,853
Today is Sunday.

24
00:03:13,854 --> 00:03:16,454
And the hospitals around here are all closed.

25
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:21,154
Right. We could ask Dr. Araide, what do you say?

26
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:24,079
Yes. I called him a while ago, but he wasn't in.

27
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:29,354
He's probably busy because the trial for that case is coming up.

28
00:03:31,654 --> 00:03:33,253
Come to think of it, there's a hospital

29
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,653
inside the Tohto Department Store in Haidocho.

30
00:03:35,654 --> 00:03:37,054
So maybe we should take her there.

31
00:03:37,954 --> 00:03:40,254
If I remember correctly, their day off is Thursday.

32
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,653
You don't have to go out of your way to take me to the hospital.

33
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:45,853
Well, there's nothing better than

34
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:48,154
getting rid of your cold as soon as possible.

35
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,354
Like they say, colds may lead to all kinds of diseases.

36
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:06,053
What?

37
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:08,853
You mean we can't see her right away?

38
00:04:08,854 --> 00:04:12,853
No. We have a lot of patients today.

39
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:15,454
You'll have to wait about two hours if you come now.

40
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:17,953
Well, it can't be helped.

41
00:04:17,954 --> 00:04:20,554
Let's put in an appointment anyway, Dr. Agasa.

42
00:04:22,454 --> 00:04:25,254
Excuse me. We'd like to make an appointment.

43
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:27,153
Yes.

44
00:04:27,154 --> 00:04:30,954
I guess we can kill time in the department store then.

45
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:34,254
Yes. Thank you.

46
00:04:37,954 --> 00:04:39,253
I guess so.

47
00:04:39,254 --> 00:04:41,754
I'm getting kind of hungry, too.

48
00:04:45,854 --> 00:04:47,453
There's the shop that is famous

49
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,654
for serving great egg porridge in the restaurant arcade here.

50
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:55,053
I'm sure that eating it will make Ai feel a little better

51
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:56,954
and start recovering.

52
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:10,154
Okay, Doc.

53
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:13,754
All right...

54
00:05:16,654 --> 00:05:20,553
All right...

55
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:21,554
Stop.

56
00:05:24,654 --> 00:05:27,354
Okay. We're here, Ai.

57
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,854
Here. Hang on to me.

58
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:43,254
You're still feeling unsteady, aren't you?

59
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:51,054
Hey. I'm not that hopeless, okay?

60
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,053
Never mind. Will you just move out of my way?

61
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:57,753
Yes.

62
00:05:57,754 --> 00:05:59,453
I can manage to get off the car...

63
00:05:59,454 --> 00:06:00,753
There you go again.

64
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:02,354
By myself.

65
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:13,654
Porsche.

66
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:16,354
356 A.

67
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:25,654
Gin's car.

68
00:06:30,354 --> 00:06:32,354
Hey, Ai.

69
00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:37,754
Hey, Ai.

70
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:40,654
Ai.

71
00:06:42,154 --> 00:06:46,053
That is undoubtedly the same model as that of Gin's.

72
00:06:46,054 --> 00:06:48,154
But his is black and this is green.

73
00:06:49,054 --> 00:06:50,754
The color is different.

74
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:53,153
And besides,

75
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:56,354
since all three Porsches are parked so close together...

76
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,853
I'm sure that a bunch of Porsche lovers got together

77
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:01,954
to eat at the department store.

78
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:09,453
Another Porsche.

79
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:11,554
It's a 911.

80
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:22,153
Okay, we're here.

81
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:25,053
"Yoshihito Kureko (45)" -We're here, Mr. Banba.

82
00:07:25,054 --> 00:07:26,454
Mr. Banba.

83
00:07:28,054 --> 00:07:31,553
Darn. Another O.B.

84
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:34,553
"Yukiya Banba (41)" -Hopeless.

85
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,653
It's hopeless.

86
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:39,253
Well, it's not something unexpected though.

87
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:41,953
Okay then, why don't we do some shopping or something like always

88
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:43,554
until Banba's booze wears off?

89
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:46,053
Hold it.

90
00:07:46,054 --> 00:07:47,953
Let me go back to the car and get my wallet.

91
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:49,053
Yes.

92
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:50,254
I guess I'll go, too.

93
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:53,254
Excuse me, mister.

94
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:58,853
Are the four Porsches parked here all yours?

95
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,353
Yes.

96
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,753
That green, old one is Mr. Hotei's.

97
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:06,454
"Eiji Hotei (39)" -Porsche 356 A.

98
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,953
The new car to the right edge

99
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:12,353
is Ms. Taiyama's Porsche Boxter.

100
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:14,153
"Kaoru Taiyama (34)"

101
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:16,653
And this is my dear car.

102
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:19,253
Porsche 911.

103
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:21,153
And this red one

104
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:23,753
is Porsche 928 that belongs to Mr. Banba

105
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,353
who is asleep in my car.

106
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:28,953
But why were all four men riding in your car?

107
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:30,453
Well, that's because...

108
00:08:30,454 --> 00:08:33,253
We're all Porsche lovers

109
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:35,254
as well as friends who play golf together.

110
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:38,553
When all four of us go golfing, we gather here,

111
00:08:38,554 --> 00:08:42,354
then take Kureko's car and head off together in one car.

112
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:45,653
The more the merrier

113
00:08:45,654 --> 00:08:48,353
and the highway fee is cheaper that way, too.

114
00:08:48,354 --> 00:08:52,553
Even the parking fee here is free

115
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:54,653
if we shop in this department store, too.

116
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:57,453
Besides, after we make half a round,

117
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,653
there's someone here who gulps down more beer.

118
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:03,653
By the time we're done, someone is completely drunk.

119
00:09:03,654 --> 00:09:05,953
We have no other choice but go shopping or something

120
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:07,654
until he sleeps it off.

121
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:12,053
Well, this parking lot is crowded on Sunday

122
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:14,753
and it's difficult to find an open stall.

123
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,253
So it's like we're saving a stall for ourselves.

124
00:09:17,254 --> 00:09:19,453
Hey, it's time we get going.

125
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:20,454
Yes.

126
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:21,454
See you.

127
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:25,354
Saving a stall?

128
00:09:26,154 --> 00:09:29,453
I guess he means that nobody has guts enough

129
00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:31,354
to park their car between two Porsches.

130
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,453
I see.

131
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:37,254
Okay, Ai. Shall we start off, too?

132
00:09:41,054 --> 00:09:42,254
Ai?

133
00:09:43,454 --> 00:09:44,953
Count me out.

134
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:46,353
What?

135
00:09:46,354 --> 00:09:48,553
I don't feel too well.

136
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:49,853
So I guess I'll wait here in the car

137
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:51,554
until the time for my appointment with the doctor.

138
00:09:57,654 --> 00:09:59,453
Hey, Ai.

139
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:00,754
It can't be helped.

140
00:10:01,454 --> 00:10:04,754
She was tailed by people she doesn't know the identity of.

141
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:08,153
It's no wonder she's all worked up.

142
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:10,154
Which means that...

143
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:13,254
the ones who were tailing us were the Men in Black.

144
00:10:14,154 --> 00:10:16,954
Could be, although I'm not all that sure myself yet.

145
00:10:17,754 --> 00:10:20,253
I've got to at least find out

146
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:22,754
whether it's me or Ai that they're after.

147
00:10:24,554 --> 00:10:26,354
Otherwise, I can't make any moves.

148
00:10:33,654 --> 00:10:37,353
There was robbery in the Tokyo metropolitan area last night before dawn.

149
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:39,053
The killer is still on the run.

150
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:41,954
The police are collecting the information from an eyewitness.

151
00:10:43,054 --> 00:10:45,854
Me or Ai?

152
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:59,694
I think it was the 10th floor.

153
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,694
I wonder if it's okay, though.

154
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:06,193
We left Ai back there alone.

155
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:07,894
We had no other choice, did we?

156
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:23,594
Kyoto type ramen.

157
00:11:27,594 --> 00:11:29,394
They serve western style food here.

158
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:34,994
Italian food.

159
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:37,594
Chinese food.

160
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:40,894
There sure is a lot of variety, isn't there?

161
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:43,494
What is it?

162
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:47,094
Boy, what a long line.

163
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:51,493
Tarugatei.

164
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:52,794
Here it is.

165
00:11:55,994 --> 00:11:59,393
Hey, hey. You got to be kidding.

166
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:02,294
Look at this line, Dr. Agasa.

167
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:06,894
Just as would be expected of a shop famous for egg porridge.

168
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,594
We can kill time just standing in line.

169
00:12:12,794 --> 00:12:14,094
Huh?

170
00:12:15,394 --> 00:12:19,193
Oh, no. I left my cell phone in the car.

171
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:20,893
I'll go get it.

172
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:22,393
You guys go on inside.

173
00:12:22,394 --> 00:12:23,894
I'll be right back.

174
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:28,594
They're the people we just saw a while ago in the parking lot.

175
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:31,094
Hey!

176
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:34,293
Cool kid.

177
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:36,294
Long time no see.

178
00:12:37,094 --> 00:12:38,694
Jo...

179
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:41,794
Jodie?

180
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:45,693
Ran and Sonoko, too.

181
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:46,993
-Hello. -Hello.

182
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:48,793
What's up?

183
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:50,493
What brings you here?

184
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:53,693
We came to eat the egg porridge of Tarugatei.

185
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:55,093
Bug you?

186
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:56,894
No, not at all.

187
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:01,893
I wasn't referring to you, Sonoko.

188
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:04,593
We told Jodie that it's really delicious.

189
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:05,993
Then she said she wanted to come and eat it.

190
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:10,993
Yes. Japanese food is healthy and very good.

191
00:13:10,994 --> 00:13:13,493
I see.

192
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:16,693
And why are you both here, Conan?

193
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:18,693
You were saying that you were going to visit Ai

194
00:13:18,694 --> 00:13:21,293
who is in bed with a cold.

195
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:22,393
Well...

196
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:24,893
Ai?

197
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:28,593
Yes. Actually, Ai was...

198
00:13:28,594 --> 00:13:34,793
Going here with us to eat the egg porridge.

199
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:37,593
But her cold is so bad and she didn't look like she could make it.

200
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:39,194
So we left her behind.

201
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:42,094
Right, Dr. Agasa?

202
00:13:46,294 --> 00:13:48,394
That's the story.

203
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:56,393
For those watching "Wild Sunday" at home,

204
00:13:56,394 --> 00:13:57,894
please look at this.

205
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:05,193
Look at that long line of people.

206
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:08,293
This is the restaurant arcade inside the Tohto Department Store.

207
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:10,093
-The line you see... -See.

208
00:14:10,094 --> 00:14:11,793
-is in front of Tarugatei. -It's even popular on TV.

209
00:14:11,794 --> 00:14:13,994
So we had an urge to come eat here.

210
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:18,093
She's Tomomi Kato of the Gourmet Corner.

211
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:19,793
You're right.

212
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:22,694
Hey, hey. Listen to me, will you?

213
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:25,694
Okay, I'll start my interview right away.

214
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,693
The serial arsonist hasn't been arrested yet.

215
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:50,593
The Metropolitan Police Department is asking the people

216
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:53,094
in the vicinity to be very careful.

217
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,894
What I'm saying is that everyone was dumb.

218
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:01,493
Thank you very much.

219
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:03,893
So here is Yuka Mitsueda

220
00:15:03,894 --> 00:15:06,194
with "The Place I Promised to Meet You".

221
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:14,693
And so let me go

222
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:16,594
and interview someone else now.

223
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:19,294
Boy, could I talk to you for a minute?

224
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:24,094
Did you come to here to Tohto Department Store to eat egg porridge, too?

225
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:31,493
Yes. But since there are so many people in line,

226
00:15:31,494 --> 00:15:32,993
I guess I'm not.

227
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:34,794
Really? Is that right?

228
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:26,593
Did you come to eat egg porridge here at Tarugatei, too?

229
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:28,093
Yes.

230
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:31,194
That's it. We're leaving.

231
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,593
Come on, Dr. Agasa.

232
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,193
Let's go. Quick!

233
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:38,793
Hey!

234
00:16:38,794 --> 00:16:40,194
Wait!

235
00:16:40,994 --> 00:16:42,093
Hey.

236
00:16:42,094 --> 00:16:44,393
Conan!

237
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:46,393
People go in and out of this shop quite quickly,

238
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:48,593
so you'll be able to eat soon.

239
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:50,593
Let them be, Ran.

240
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:51,893
Yes, but...

241
00:16:51,894 --> 00:16:54,694
Kids wouldn't really know the difference in taste anyway.

242
00:16:58,794 --> 00:17:00,493
Hey.

243
00:17:00,494 --> 00:17:02,593
What's up?

244
00:17:02,594 --> 00:17:03,993
All of a sudden.

245
00:17:03,994 --> 00:17:07,594
Hey, Shinichi! Shinichi.

246
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:55,294
The person I saw a while ago.

247
00:17:58,894 --> 00:18:00,494
He came back.

248
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:09,994
Dr. Agasa and Shinichi.

249
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:13,993
What's up?

250
00:18:13,994 --> 00:18:16,193
Why does he look...

251
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:17,894
so dreadfully serious?

252
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:20,694
Shinichi!

253
00:18:36,694 --> 00:18:39,094
Mr. Banba!

254
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:52,693
What is this?

255
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:54,593
What's the matter?

256
00:18:54,594 --> 00:18:55,794
Shinichi.

257
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:59,293
No good.

258
00:18:59,294 --> 00:19:00,994
He's been strangled.

259
00:19:02,094 --> 00:19:04,293
Hello. Is this police?

260
00:19:04,294 --> 00:19:07,393
I'm calling from the basement parking lot of the Tohto Department Store

261
00:19:07,394 --> 00:19:08,394
from my cell phone.

262
00:19:08,395 --> 00:19:10,493
-I'll stay back here. -Yes.

263
00:19:10,494 --> 00:19:13,394
So take Ai and and get away from here, Dr. Agasa.

264
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:15,993
Why?

265
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:19,694
My face was taken by the TV cameras a while ago.

266
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:26,393
If the guys who were tailing us the other day were the Men in Black,

267
00:19:26,394 --> 00:19:30,293
we can't be too sure that they won't come here after seeing me, right?

268
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,093
Don't worry.

269
00:19:32,094 --> 00:19:34,893
The TV program just a while ago is the afternoon wide show.

270
00:19:34,894 --> 00:19:37,394
The viewer rating is only about 10 percent.

271
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:41,693
It's not a live broadcast that's aired during golden time.

272
00:19:41,694 --> 00:19:43,893
It's most probable that they're not watching.

273
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:45,093
Fool!

274
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:47,393
The number of TV viewers in the Kanto District

275
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,193
is approximately four million people.

276
00:19:49,194 --> 00:19:50,793
Even if the viewer rating were to be one percent,

277
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:53,793
the number of people watching would be about 400,000.

278
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:56,793
10 percent makes it 4 million people.

279
00:19:56,794 --> 00:20:00,194
There's no guarantee that they wouldn't be watching.

280
00:20:01,894 --> 00:20:03,593
True.

281
00:20:03,594 --> 00:20:07,094
So now that you understand, hurry and get Ai out of here.

282
00:20:09,194 --> 00:20:10,493
If you look around Tokyo,

283
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:13,593
I'm sure you'll be able to find a hospital that is open even on Sunday.

284
00:20:13,594 --> 00:20:15,093
I feel sorry for Ai.

285
00:20:15,094 --> 00:20:17,194
But she'll just have to hold up till then.

286
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:31,794
"Tarugatei."

287
00:20:39,594 --> 00:20:41,594
It sure rains a lot, doesn't it?

288
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:46,893
Hey, look.

289
00:20:46,894 --> 00:20:49,993
There are police cars parked in front of this department store.

290
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:51,994
I wonder if something happened.

291
00:20:53,994 --> 00:20:57,793
Don't tell me that the glasses kid

292
00:20:57,794 --> 00:21:00,494
is messed up in some case again.

293
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,493
No way.

294
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:07,093
Seeing is believing.

295
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:09,593
Which means seeing is believing.

296
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:11,094
Shall we go check?

297
00:21:12,394 --> 00:21:13,694
What?

298
00:21:16,794 --> 00:21:19,194
Hey, how come you're not letting us out?

299
00:21:20,294 --> 00:21:24,793
Well, we were contacted by the police a while ago.

300
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:28,093
There's been a grave incident inside this parking lot

301
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:31,593
that I can't let anyone out of here.

302
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:33,493
So now you know,

303
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:37,593
we can't get out of here until the killer is caught, Shinichi.

304
00:21:37,594 --> 00:21:38,993
It can't be helped.

305
00:21:38,994 --> 00:21:42,193
Find an empty lot and wait there.

306
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:45,594
But what if they come?

307
00:21:46,794 --> 00:21:50,593
Don't worry. I'll solve the case right away.

308
00:21:50,594 --> 00:21:52,594
Don't move till then.

309
00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:56,093
Hey, Shinichi.

310
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:57,294
Shinichi.

311
00:22:15,994 --> 00:22:17,494
Don't worry.

312
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:21,994
I'll solve the case right away.

313
00:23:57,994 --> 00:24:00,193
"Next Episode" -Reddish...

314
00:24:00,194 --> 00:24:01,594
Brown hair.

315
00:24:03,094 --> 00:24:04,693
I can't make it out.

316
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:08,193
How did the murderer strangle Mr. Banba

317
00:24:08,194 --> 00:24:10,894
and how they retrieved the murder weapon?

318
00:24:12,894 --> 00:24:14,593
This is it!

319
00:24:14,594 --> 00:24:16,393
I've got to contact Dr. Agasa right away

320
00:24:16,394 --> 00:24:18,494
and get Ai out of here fast.

321
00:24:19,094 --> 00:24:20,793
What?

322
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,094
Dr. Agasa and Ai are both gone!

323
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:27,794
Next Conan, "Four Porsches (Part 2)"

324
00:24:43,594 --> 00:24:45,993
Next Conan's Hint:

325
00:24:45,994 --> 00:24:48,193
"Power Window."

326
00:24:48,194 --> 00:24:49,793
Repeat after me.

327
00:24:49,794 --> 00:24:51,193
Power window.

328
00:24:51,194 --> 00:24:52,994
-Power window... -Yes.
