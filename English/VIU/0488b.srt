1
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:26,443
The victim of the murder is Mr. Tenji Urushibara,

2
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,443
age 47, president of an entertainment production.

3
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:32,343
The estimated time of his death is around 13:00.

4
00:00:32,343 --> 00:00:35,243
He died of loss of blood from a stab wound.

5
00:00:36,743 --> 00:00:40,043
And, who first discovered the corpse?

6
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:41,743
Oh, me.

7
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:44,043
At 14:00, President Urushibara

8
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,643
and the producer of a program that I'm in charge of

9
00:00:46,643 --> 00:00:50,743
was supposed to have a meeting in this reception room, but...

10
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:53,143
I came to tell him that the meeting would be later than scheduled.

11
00:00:53,143 --> 00:00:56,243
That's when.

12
00:00:56,243 --> 00:00:59,643
I contacted the police and ambulance right away.

13
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:03,043
As well as Satan, who just happened to be at this TV station

14
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:04,643
and belongs to the production run by the president.

15
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:06,043
Satan?

16
00:01:07,043 --> 00:01:08,543
It's me.

17
00:01:08,543 --> 00:01:10,743
What... what're you?

18
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:12,143
A Death God?

19
00:01:12,143 --> 00:01:14,443
I'm Satan.

20
00:01:14,443 --> 00:01:18,043
I'm Satan Onizuka, the vocal for Styx III!

21
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:21,143
Styx III? Santa Onizuka?

22
00:01:21,143 --> 00:01:23,143
Wrong, Inspector!

23
00:01:23,143 --> 00:01:25,343
Oh, I know you.

24
00:01:25,343 --> 00:01:26,843
You're the one in the visual rock band

25
00:01:26,843 --> 00:01:28,743
that used to be popular about 3 or 4 years ago.

26
00:01:28,743 --> 00:01:32,543
Hey, hey. What do you mean "used to be"?

27
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:36,743
And, do you know if your boss was hated by anyone or not?

28
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:38,743
With a personality like his,

29
00:01:38,743 --> 00:01:41,143
I'm sure there were many who hated him.

30
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:44,243
I was one of them too.

31
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:46,843
So then, let me ask you.

32
00:01:46,843 --> 00:01:48,943
At the time of the crime, which was around 13:00,

33
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,143
where were you, and what were you doing?

34
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:52,843
I was in the dressing room at that time.

35
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:54,943
He was folding origami!

36
00:01:54,943 --> 00:01:56,843
You guys?

37
00:01:56,843 --> 00:02:00,543
That devil said he was folding origami!

38
00:02:00,543 --> 00:02:01,943
Origami?

39
00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:03,443
He made five paper cranes!

40
00:02:03,443 --> 00:02:06,143
He seems to have been trying to kill time.

41
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:09,243
But please keep this a secret from everyone.

42
00:02:09,243 --> 00:02:12,143
He's going to curse you to death if you tell.

43
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:14,843
What? Cursed to death?

44
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,843
That's what I tell all my fans.

45
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:18,943
I mean, it really doesn't match for a devil

46
00:02:18,943 --> 00:02:20,743
to have a hobby like origami, does it?

47
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:23,043
Oh, I see.

48
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,943
Were you here all the while

49
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:26,843
before these children came to see you?

50
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:29,043
Yeah, I ate take-out lunch,

51
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:32,843
took a quick nap, and started folding origami after that.

52
00:02:32,843 --> 00:02:38,443
Which means you were here at the TV station way earlier than scheduled?

53
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:41,143
I was in the dressing waiting room by 11:00.

54
00:02:41,143 --> 00:02:44,043
I asked my manager to order take-out food

55
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:45,943
and to go get me some stuff right away.

56
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:48,843
Yes, when I came back, I saw the children

57
00:02:48,843 --> 00:02:51,143
just about to go into Satan's room,

58
00:02:51,143 --> 00:02:52,843
so at first I stopped them.

59
00:02:52,843 --> 00:02:53,943
Because I was told not to wake him

60
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:56,243
until time to go into the studio at 14:00.

61
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,543
I see.

62
00:02:57,543 --> 00:03:00,043
Which means you have no alibi

63
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:03,143
at the time of the crime.

64
00:03:03,143 --> 00:03:06,343
That's right. I couldn't have done it.

65
00:03:06,343 --> 00:03:08,543
If I leave this dressing room with this face,

66
00:03:08,543 --> 00:03:10,643
I would sure stand out, wouldn't I?

67
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:13,843
Why don't you gather all the guys at the TV station

68
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:17,543
and ask them if they've seen me around the time in question?

69
00:03:17,543 --> 00:03:19,443
But if he takes off his make-up

70
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:20,443
and walks around without anything on...

71
00:03:20,443 --> 00:03:23,143
I see, he could've walked around the TV station without make-up,

72
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:24,743
headed for the reception room,

73
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:25,743
and return to his room

74
00:03:25,743 --> 00:03:27,743
after committing the crime then put on his make-up.

75
00:03:27,743 --> 00:03:29,543
I don't think that's possible.

76
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,143
What do you mean?

77
00:03:31,143 --> 00:03:34,043
Does it take a lot of time to put make-up on?

78
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:37,043
No, it only takes at most about 30 minutes.

79
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:40,543
Either way, there's no mirror in this dressing room.

80
00:03:42,843 --> 00:03:43,843
Mirror?

81
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:45,043
There's no mirror?

82
00:03:45,043 --> 00:03:48,943
There seems to be a leading actor who doesn't like mirrors,

83
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:52,743
that are two or three rooms in at this station with no mirrors.

84
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:55,543
Satan always uses that place over there.

85
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:57,843
I don't like mirrors either.

86
00:03:57,843 --> 00:04:00,343
Especially big ones.

87
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:03,643
Would you like to take a look at the dressing room?

88
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:14,243
It's true that there's no mirror on the wall.

89
00:04:16,743 --> 00:04:18,843
Inspector!

90
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:20,943
There's one here!

91
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:24,743
But this mirror is what I just bought a while ago.

92
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:27,443
And something that I handed over to Satan

93
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:29,043
when I came into this room with the children.

94
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:31,343
Please tell me where that store is.

95
00:04:31,343 --> 00:04:32,943
I'll go confirm.

96
00:04:32,943 --> 00:04:33,943
Okay.

97
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:37,043
Also, if you would, please let us investigate the dressing room

98
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,643
and Satan's belongings,

99
00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:41,643
as well as his person.

100
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:43,143
Sure, go ahead.

101
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:50,243
In the bag... There seems to be make-up cosmetics.

102
00:04:50,243 --> 00:04:52,143
There is no mirror.

103
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:53,743
He doesn't seem to have any on him.

104
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:59,643
What's with this dirty top and cap?

105
00:04:59,643 --> 00:05:02,543
It says "Akumaya" on the chest part?

106
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:04,543
I'm using that for the scene of the talk show

107
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:07,643
that I'm going to be appearing on today, so I brought it with me.

108
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:09,343
During my live shows I usually do a stand-up comedy

109
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:10,843
with the other members between songs.

110
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,743
Hello, we're the Akumaya.

111
00:05:12,743 --> 00:05:15,043
We've come to bring you misfortune.

112
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:17,443
Like so.

113
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:20,543
Officer Takagi, will you go confirm this with the program staff?

114
00:05:20,543 --> 00:05:21,543
Yes, sir.

115
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:23,243
By the way, I use that make-up kit

116
00:05:23,243 --> 00:05:26,343
to fix my make-up when I'm on air.

117
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:27,443
If it's to do a slight touch up,

118
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:29,543
all I have to do is borrow the make-up of the women staff

119
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:31,443
and fix myself up.

120
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:33,343
Well, I don't perspire that much,

121
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:35,243
so I don't really need to touch up too frequently.

122
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:37,243
But it seems that your purple lipstick

123
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:39,243
doesn't stay on all that long.

124
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:41,743
That cigarette butt

125
00:05:41,743 --> 00:05:44,243
with purple lipstick on the filter.

126
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,343
The same color is here and there on the autograph sheet

127
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:48,443
that you autographed for Mitsuhiko too.

128
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:50,743
That's true. How come?

129
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:52,143
Back then, Satan held

130
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,943
the cap of the pen in his mouth and autographed the sheet, right?

131
00:05:54,943 --> 00:05:57,543
That's why the color of his lipstick

132
00:05:57,543 --> 00:05:59,143
smeared off on your hand

133
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:01,743
from the pen he returned to you, Mitsuhiko.

134
00:06:01,743 --> 00:06:03,443
And since you were holding the autograph sheet all the while,

135
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:06,143
the color smeared onto the sheet too.

136
00:06:06,143 --> 00:06:08,143
-Is that so? -I see!

137
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:10,743
Oh, but strange.

138
00:06:10,743 --> 00:06:13,143
There are no purple smears on the take-out lunch dishes,

139
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:15,943
chopsticks or spoon that you ate your lunch with.

140
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:18,143
And yet they are all things you bring to your mouth.

141
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:19,943
I wonder why?

142
00:06:19,943 --> 00:06:22,643
It... it's true, that's strange.

143
00:06:22,643 --> 00:06:26,743
I lightly wipe off my lipstick when I eat lunch.

144
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:29,643
I don't like the color smearing off on my chopsticks and dishes.

145
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:33,643
Besides, lipstick is not hard to put back on even without a mirror.

146
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,343
Then is that color around your eyes also lipstick?

147
00:06:36,343 --> 00:06:38,543
It's the same purple color.

148
00:06:38,543 --> 00:06:39,743
It's not lipstick,

149
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:41,543
but color made by the same manufacturer.

150
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:43,943
Of course I need to use a mirror to put this on, though.

151
00:06:43,943 --> 00:06:48,343
Well, if there's a person who can put this on without using a mirror...

152
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:51,343
That person for sure is either, really god or the devil!

153
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:53,043
I guess so.

154
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:56,343
You like that purple color, don't you, Mr. Devil?

155
00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:59,543
Yeah, I've liked it since the Indies days.

156
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:02,543
This color can only be made by this manufacturer.

157
00:07:02,543 --> 00:07:05,243
Since today's job is not a live performance,

158
00:07:05,243 --> 00:07:07,443
the white on my face and gray on my cheeks

159
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:10,843
are water based-type foundation that are easy to get a hold of.

160
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:14,243
Is anything the matter?

161
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:16,143
Satan's got dry eye

162
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:17,543
because he's wearing contacts.

163
00:07:18,943 --> 00:07:21,443
-Here, eye drops. -No, I'm fine.

164
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,343
But your eyes are red.

165
00:07:25,343 --> 00:07:26,943
I'm telling you that I'm fine!

166
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:28,843
Just leave me alone, will you?

167
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:32,643
Really. No mirror was found in this room,

168
00:07:32,643 --> 00:07:35,243
in my bag or when I was body checked,

169
00:07:35,243 --> 00:07:38,143
so how do you propose I put on my make-up?

170
00:07:38,143 --> 00:07:39,243
Take-out delivery lunch.

171
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:44,343
Let's say that after committing the crime,

172
00:07:44,343 --> 00:07:46,843
you gave the mirror that you used to fix your make-up

173
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:51,343
to one of the men who delivered the food here.

174
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:52,943
Then all would be okay, right?

175
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:03,443
If that method were used, it's possible.

176
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:05,443
It's not possible.

177
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,143
I asked the guard about it.

178
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:10,943
He said that the only delivery service that came before 14:00

179
00:08:10,943 --> 00:08:12,343
were only those three lunch deliveries,

180
00:08:12,343 --> 00:08:14,643
and moreover, they all arrived at around 12:00.

181
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:16,643
I already confirmed it just in case,

182
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:19,843
but all three deliveries brought food at around 12:00,

183
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:22,043
and Satan seems to have told all of them

184
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,143
to come get the dishes at sundown.

185
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:26,143
So, the dishes haven't been retrieved yet.

186
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:28,943
And all three deliverymen said that when they delivered the meal,

187
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,843
Satan was wearing his usual make-up

188
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,343
and nothing was out of the ordinary.

189
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:36,343
If the delivery services came before the crime was committed,

190
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:39,343
it would be impossible to give him a mirror after the crime.

191
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:42,143
The only possibility left is when the AD came to get him,

192
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:44,343
and on the way rushing over to the reception room,

193
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:47,443
he threw the mirror that he had on him away.

194
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:51,043
I don't think that's possible.

195
00:08:51,043 --> 00:08:52,943
I was watching with these very eyes.

196
00:08:52,943 --> 00:08:55,343
All Satan did was run.

197
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:56,743
I see.

198
00:08:56,743 --> 00:09:03,043
And the manager bought the mirror at about 12:30 noon.

199
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,643
To get here to Nichiuri TV,

200
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:06,943
it would take at least one hour even by car.

201
00:09:06,943 --> 00:09:09,343
It would be impossible to deliver it beforehand.

202
00:09:09,343 --> 00:09:11,543
The delivery boy costume

203
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:14,743
was unmistakably scheduled to be used on the program.

204
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:19,043
And the TV station got the outfit for him too.

205
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:20,943
But were they really going to shoot a program of him

206
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:22,043
wearing that make-up in delivery man's outfit?

207
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:23,843
Everybody seemed to like it when we did a live performance though.

208
00:09:23,843 --> 00:09:26,243
My head is completely reset,

209
00:09:26,243 --> 00:09:28,343
so wearing a cap won't throw it out of place either.

210
00:09:28,343 --> 00:09:31,343
Come to think of it, where did you change into that devil look?

211
00:09:31,343 --> 00:09:34,143
Were you already dressed like that when you came to the dressing room?

212
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:35,543
At home!

213
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:37,043
I completed everything at home

214
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,143
and came here by car.

215
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:41,443
I parked the car in the parking lot and came right up here.

216
00:09:41,443 --> 00:09:44,143
Of course, my manager kept my bag for me.

217
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:45,943
It doesn't look right for me to be carrying a bag

218
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:47,443
looking like this, you see.

219
00:09:47,443 --> 00:09:50,743
When you were folding origami, were you smoking?

220
00:09:50,743 --> 00:09:52,343
Yeah. When I do things requiring detail,

221
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,943
I smoke, at times.

222
00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:55,543
Bug you?

223
00:09:57,343 --> 00:10:00,843
Not at all. I was just wondering.

224
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:02,843
He's lying.

225
00:10:02,843 --> 00:10:04,743
This man is lying.

226
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:17,333
The sun's already set.

227
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,533
Yes.

228
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,933
He must be the killer after all.

229
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:23,933
He probably removed his make-up once,

230
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:25,733
and went to the boss's room looking his normal self, then killed him.

231
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:28,833
He then put his make up back on and became the devil again.

232
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,433
The question is, where did he get a hold of the mirror

233
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:34,633
he needed to put on his make-up and where did he get rid of it?

234
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:38,133
Although there were several restrooms from here to the reception room,

235
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:41,633
if he uses the mirror there, people would undoubtedly see him.

236
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:44,233
If by chance, nobody saw him there,

237
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:46,333
if he passed this corridor looking the way he is,

238
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,233
somebody is sure to have remembered seeing him.

239
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,933
If he wears something over his head, he would stand out even more.

240
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,833
It's most natural to think that he came back here to this room

241
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:57,233
and fixed his make-up.

242
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:59,133
But there's one other thing that's also bothering me.

243
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:00,833
Those paper cranes.

244
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,433
He says that he couldn't commit the crime because he was folding them.

245
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:04,033
If he intends to use that as an alibi,

246
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:05,933
five cranes are too few a number to have finished folding.

247
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,033
Moreover, to establish his alibi,

248
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,733
he lined up what he already made and brought in here.

249
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:10,233
Which means that if any one of his cranes are squashed,

250
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:12,833
it would be plain to see.

251
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:16,833
So, then, what is it? What meaning do the origami and cranes have?

252
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,633
Maybe this is the mirror.

253
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:21,633
See, this window,

254
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:25,633
the figures of Genta and Mitsuhiko can clearly be seen.

255
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,933
But take a very close look.

256
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:32,533
Where is your face, Young Lady?

257
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:35,533
See, it's dark so you can't see clearly, can you?

258
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:36,633
Yeah, it's true!

259
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:39,633
Getting closer to the mirror makes it dark so that you can't see well.

260
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,233
The crime was committed around 13:00 in the afternoon.

261
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,933
It's still lighted outside.

262
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:46,933
It won't serve as a mirror unless it becomes dark, right?

263
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:52,033
I see. That's why he used the origami.

264
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:53,633
I finally figured out

265
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:56,333
the trick of how you returned back to your devil appearance!

266
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,533
Doc, where were you?

267
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:03,033
I'm sorry, my cell phone ran out of battery,

268
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:05,833
so I was contacting everybody's residence by public phone.

269
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,233
Officer.

270
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,933
Haven't you got your answer already?

271
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:11,433
If I walk around the TV station looking like this,

272
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:14,933
someone is bound to notice.

273
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:16,033
Like I said a while ago,

274
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:18,633
if I killed the boss...

275
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:20,633
In order to go to the reception room two floors up,

276
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:22,633
I'd have to remove my make-up once

277
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:24,133
and come back here after committing the crime,

278
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:26,633
then put my make-up back on again.

279
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:27,933
But look,

280
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:30,433
there is no mirror in this dressing room.

281
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,033
Of course there is none in my bag,

282
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:34,433
or anywhere on me!

283
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:38,133
The only mirror there is, is the one my manager went out to get for me.

284
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,433
That's the only mirror there is,

285
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:41,633
but it was given to me after the crime, wasn't it?

286
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:43,933
I already had make-up on at that time.

287
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:46,033
I looked just like this, right?

288
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,033
Yes, not only did I see him,

289
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,433
but the children were there too.

290
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:53,833
I can't draw this face without a mirror.

291
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:54,833
You're right.

292
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,833
If so, ever since I came to this TV station today,

293
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:01,333
I looked this way right through.

294
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:06,033
So, leave me alone to grieve over the death of my boss.

295
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:09,333
I can't cry in front of people being that I'm a devil.

296
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,633
You're right.

297
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:12,033
Okay, then.

298
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:14,533
At least let me take off my make-up.

299
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:16,633
All I need is three minutes.

300
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:18,033
If it's not my face,

301
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:21,333
nobody would know it's me even if I shed tears.

302
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,533
I see.

303
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:26,433
You're planning to remove it along with your make-up?

304
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:32,833
The evidence that had turned you into a real devil...

305
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:36,033
The scarlet red trace of crime!

306
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,566
Hey! Gramps.

307
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:44,866
He's using my voice again without permission.

308
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,566
What sort of joke is this supposed to be?

309
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:47,866
It's not funny.

310
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:50,666
It's true that you couldn't go with that appearance of yours,

311
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,366
but if you remove your make-up

312
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:54,366
and wear the outfit of the deliveryman,

313
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,966
no one would notice that it's you.

314
00:13:56,966 --> 00:14:01,166
That's why you ordered three different dishes from three different shops.

315
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,466
In other words, just around the time of the crime,

316
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:06,566
three deliverymen would be going in and out of here.

317
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:09,966
You mixed yourself among them and committed the crime.

318
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:11,466
And if the clothing that each of the deliverymen

319
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:13,166
are wearing similar the better.

320
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,466
The people who saw them,

321
00:14:14,466 --> 00:14:17,266
wouldn't go out of their way to remember the face of each man.

322
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:18,366
Then, don't tell me

323
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:21,766
that the outfit of the delivery person that was in his bag back then was...

324
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:22,766
Right.

325
00:14:22,766 --> 00:14:26,566
He used the outfit Akumaya that he was going to use on his talk show.

326
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,866
You're talking as if you saw what actually happened.

327
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:30,866
Exactly.

328
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:32,266
I was watching,

329
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:34,766
back then, at the queer delivery man who ran through

330
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:37,566
without holding any delivery box in hand.

331
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:39,766
"Rairaiken" -I see.

332
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:43,166
Any delivery man would normally be holding a delivery box.

333
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,166
Of course, when he comes and when he leaves.

334
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,366
But this is a TV station.

335
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:50,666
Maybe an actor wearing that sort of outfit happened to pass by?

336
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,166
I thought so for an instant too.

337
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,766
But no matter how small the role,

338
00:14:54,766 --> 00:14:57,266
a little bit of make-up would be used.

339
00:14:57,266 --> 00:15:00,566
However, that man didn't have any make-up on whatsoever.

340
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,766
More than anything else, in the view from under the cap,

341
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:04,666
was the back part of the man's head,

342
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,266
which was the same upside-down "V" mark as that of Satan.

343
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:12,566
But you have no evidence that the delivery man was I, do you?

344
00:15:12,566 --> 00:15:16,066
There are some people with their hair shaved like mine, here and there.

345
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:18,766
The guy could even have been one of my fans.

346
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:23,866
Besides, even if I were able to come back after killing the boss,

347
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:27,066
how on earth do you propose I redid my make-up?

348
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:30,366
It's true that there's no mirror in this room.

349
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:32,166
Then all you need to do is make one

350
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,166
by using a transparent plate.

351
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,566
Transparent.

352
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:36,566
Plate?

353
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:41,966
If you're talking about this glass window, it's impossible.

354
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:43,266
As the children mentioned earlier,

355
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:45,366
if you get close enough to put make-up on,

356
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:47,866
his face would be shadowed out of view.

357
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:49,366
Besides, the murder was committed in the afternoon,

358
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,166
when not much can be reflected on the glass.

359
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,766
I've figured it out!

360
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:55,766
The killer didn't use glass.

361
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:57,066
He used that ruler!

362
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:01,766
-Ruler? -But how?

363
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:04,666
The same way as the window glass!

364
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,466
All he has to do is use this origami to make it night time.

365
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,566
What? Will that really make a mirror?

366
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:12,066
Try it! Try it!

367
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:14,966
Things like window glass and transparent plastic

368
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:19,266
are always reflecting light and projecting something.

369
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:20,966
Nothing's reflected, though.

370
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:23,066
That's just because the light on this side is strong

371
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,666
and it isn't clearly visible.

372
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,166
But if you use black origami like this

373
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,866
and block the light coming from this side...

374
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:31,466
You can really see!

375
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:35,566
It's true! Wow!

376
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:37,366
It's just like a mirror!

377
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:40,066
By the way, since a thing that is reflected on the window glass at night

378
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,466
will become shadowed,

379
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:43,966
it is hard to make out since it is dark.

380
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:46,066
But the thing that is reflected,

381
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:47,966
unlike the genuine one is monotone.

382
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,266
It's hard to make out color this way.

383
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:54,066
Then, maybe this silver color should be used.

384
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:57,066
See, this way, you can tell the colors apart.

385
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:59,466
But it's blurred and hard to see.

386
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:03,166
The color silver originally has the power to reflect things.

387
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,166
But since the surface of the paper is not smooth,

388
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,966
it looks blurred.

389
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:09,466
Besides, there's no need to make out color.

390
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:11,966
Satan's make-up only requires coloring the same places

391
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:13,866
with the respective corresponding colors.

392
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,066
I see.

393
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:17,266
Then he can put on make-up here.

394
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:20,166
Yes. In other words, Satan's crime began

395
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:23,466
right after the three delivery lunches that he ordered were delivered.

396
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:25,266
He removes his make-up immediately,

397
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:27,166
and goes to the reception room where the president is,

398
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,566
wearing his delivery man's outfit.

399
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:30,566
Then, after killing him, rushes back here,

400
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:33,966
uses the ruler mirror that he made to put his make-up back on,

401
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:37,666
and waits for the manager to come wake him up.

402
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,366
But if so,

403
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:41,066
there should be a lot of the president's blood

404
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:44,566
splattered on the delivery man's outfit.

405
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:48,066
I'm sure he probably got some other clothing ready.

406
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:51,366
Let's say, maybe something like a hooded raincoat.

407
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:53,766
Okay! Dispatch the investigation crew and look for it!

408
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:55,166
Yes, sir!

409
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:59,966
Who cares, even if you find something like that.

410
00:17:59,966 --> 00:18:02,866
I didn't do it, and besides, you don't have proof either.

411
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:05,766
I made a mirror using origami and a ruler, you say.

412
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:07,666
That's news to me.

413
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,266
All I was doing in this room was make paper cranes

414
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:13,866
while waiting for my manager to come, and that's it!

415
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:18,166
If so, won't you fold and make another paper crane for me?

416
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,166
What?

417
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,666
If you want, you may smoke too.

418
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:25,266
You get the urge to smoke when doing detailed work, don't you?

419
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:26,766
Don't be silly.

420
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:29,066
I could never fold a paper crane in this situation.

421
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,966
Then, Ayumi, please make one for him, will you?

422
00:18:31,966 --> 00:18:33,166
Okay.

423
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,166
First, you make a triangle.

424
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,166
Then, you go like this.

425
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,666
You're good, Ayumi.

426
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,266
Because when Daddy was in the hospital,

427
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:44,266
I made a lot of cranes together with mommy.

428
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:46,866
Here, all done.

429
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:48,366
It's a well-made crane,

430
00:18:48,366 --> 00:18:50,866
but it's skinny and doesn't look too energetic.

431
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:52,166
Oh, I see.

432
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,766
I see, that's right.

433
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:58,466
In order to make the crane fat,

434
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:00,466
you must blow air into.

435
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:01,466
If the crane was placed against your lips,

436
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:03,266
the lipstick should come off onto the crane.

437
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:05,366
Just like the cigarette stubs in the astray.

438
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:08,166
But none of it was found on your cranes.

439
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:12,866
In other words, those aren't the cranes that he folded today, right?

440
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:16,066
Dr. Agasa, what're you persuading yourself for?

441
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:20,366
It seems that either Satan doesn't know how to fold cranes,

442
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,866
or has forgotten how to.

443
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:26,466
Either way, those cranes were folded beforehand

444
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:29,666
in order to camouflage the mirror trick.

445
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,666
By the way, he went out of his way to tell the police

446
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,466
that he also feels hate towards his boss

447
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:35,066
so that they would suspect him

448
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:38,066
and investigate the dressing room right away,

449
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:40,866
and find that there is no mirror around.

450
00:19:40,866 --> 00:19:42,366
He didn't want to dilly-dally

451
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:44,666
because the three shops that delivered the food

452
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,766
may come to retrieve the dishes.

453
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:47,966
If they come, the fact that there is no mirror in the room

454
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:49,266
may be thrown into obscurity.

455
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:52,366
That's why he wanted them to come get the dishes at sundown.

456
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:56,566
He did so to make time for us to check the room!

457
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:57,666
It... it's a lie!

458
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,766
Satan would never kill, no way.

459
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,866
Then, let's have him remove his make-up right now

460
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:06,566
and show us his face.

461
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:08,266
Sure, okay!

462
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:10,266
Satan, go ahead and remove your make-up!

463
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:15,466
Satan?

464
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:18,366
Sorry, but I can't do that, manager.

465
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:22,766
Because if I take off this devil's mask,

466
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:26,766
under it will be the wretched face of a killer.

467
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:28,266
No, don't tell me that...

468
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:32,066
You know, don't you? About three years ago,

469
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:36,866
when I hurt my throat during a tour and was hospitalized.

470
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:40,666
Back then, there was a child who used to come visit me every day.

471
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,666
There used to always be a small box

472
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,466
with a crane inside it, each time she came.

473
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:48,066
She believed that I was a real devil.

474
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:51,366
I always looked forward to reading her letters.

475
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:52,466
But suddenly one day,

476
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:56,366
the letters from that girl stopped coming.

477
00:20:56,366 --> 00:21:00,366
Back then, I thought that she had just gotten tired of me.

478
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:05,166
But last month, when I went drinking with boss,

479
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,366
I finally found out why.

480
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,566
In his exact words, the boss said,

481
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:11,566
"Wanna cause a stir again with sacrifice?"

482
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:12,766
Sacrifice?

483
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:16,466
Right. I was in the hospital and didn't know,

484
00:21:16,466 --> 00:21:18,366
but the boss wrote a comment in the band's official website,

485
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:21,666
pretending to be me, without telling me about it.

486
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,266
He wrote, "It is necessary to make a sacrifice to recover my evil powers.

487
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:25,966
I want blood."

488
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:27,166
Don't... don't tell me

489
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,466
that child who was your fan took it seriously and...

490
00:21:32,366 --> 00:21:36,366
Yeah, when I pressured him for an answer on the spot,

491
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:37,866
he laughed and said the following.

492
00:21:37,866 --> 00:21:42,566
In the last letter it said, "I will happily give you my blood. Goodbye."

493
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:45,066
The revival live that I performed six months later

494
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:46,466
after being discharged from the hospital,

495
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:49,766
was really hot over the fact that someone had taken her life for me.

496
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:54,066
I looked for that girl's house right away and visited her residence.

497
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:56,766
I found out that she died by killing herself over an unknown reason.

498
00:21:56,766 --> 00:21:59,566
Then, you killed him to avenge her death.

499
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:01,366
Yeah, I did it.

500
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:04,566
He thinks nothing of human life if for the sake of money.

501
00:22:04,566 --> 00:22:07,966
He even crushed my plans of holding a final live performance,

502
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:09,766
telling me to pay for damages incurred

503
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:12,666
if I quit before my contract is over!

504
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:17,966
I killed the real devil!

505
00:22:17,966 --> 00:22:20,266
I mean although I seem to have my righteous reasons for doing what I did,

506
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:22,366
the fact is, these past one to two years I've been in a slump.

507
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:23,566
I've been annoyed

508
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:27,566
and maybe the fact is, I just wanted to get everything over with.

509
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,066
But my older sister was saying

510
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:33,766
Styx III is going to revive for sure.

511
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:36,266
She said that she was sure you'd be making a wondrous song

512
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:37,766
that will give everyone energy again!

513
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:39,666
I'm no good anymore.

514
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,566
I used to frequently say, "I'll possess you" or "I'll curse you",

515
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:44,666
"but I never ever said "die".

516
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:45,966
The only one who says something like that,

517
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:48,266
is the monster that comes on in the Kamen Yaiba show.

518
00:22:50,866 --> 00:22:54,766
I've fallen low to that level.

519
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:55,866
But that's...

520
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:58,966
Besides, after her letters stopped coming,

521
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:00,466
I got to thinking.

522
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:02,466
What did I do wrong,

523
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:05,066
or what did she not like about me?

524
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:08,166
When I started thinking this way, tears started pourings

525
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,566
and I couldn't compose nor write lyrics.

526
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:12,566
I couldn't write even a phrase.

527
00:23:12,566 --> 00:23:14,566
Phooey, talk about a fallen devil.

528
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:18,766
Your tears are a bit red?

529
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:21,766
That's President Urushibara's blood that splattered on him.

530
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:22,766
Blood?

531
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:31,766
You couldn't see colors very well using the ruler mirror, right?

532
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:34,366
So, you put foundation

533
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:37,166
right over the blood by your eyes without noticing.

534
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,866
You noticed it only after

535
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:41,966
your manager bought the mirror and gave it to you.

536
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:44,566
That's why you couldn't use eye drops.

537
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:46,266
Because if you did, the eye drop

538
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:48,366
would wet the area around your eyes, resulting in conclusive evidence.

539
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:50,466
-I see. -I see.

540
00:23:50,466 --> 00:23:52,366
Shall we go then?

541
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,066
But it sure is like a fairy tale.

542
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:00,666
Well, like they say,

543
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,866
"When a devil sheds tears,

544
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:05,366
he loses his evil powers".

545
00:25:36,966 --> 00:25:38,666
Now, something very shocking has happened!

546
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:41,666
Ms. Kazuka Inoue, Yoko Okino and Azusa Yamamoto

547
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,166
-have aligned in a row with nine correct answers! -You can do it!

548
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:46,166
There is only one more question to go.

549
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,166
If any one of the three answers correctly,

550
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,666
she will be the winner!

551
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,366
This program was shot

552
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:54,266
when you went to the TV station the other day, right?

553
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:57,066
Yes, but I didn't get to see Yoko after the incident,

554
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:59,366
so I don't know how it turned out.

555
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:01,066
What else can the result be,

556
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:02,566
but Yoko answering ten questions correctly

557
00:26:02,566 --> 00:26:04,866
and winning first prize?

558
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:07,366
Ms. Inoue, do you have confidence?

559
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,966
I'll do my best!

560
00:26:09,966 --> 00:26:11,366
Ms. Okino.

561
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:12,766
My fans out there.

562
00:26:12,766 --> 00:26:14,166
Root for me, okay?

563
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:16,566
Of course, of course! I'll root for you!

564
00:26:16,566 --> 00:26:18,466
Ms. Yamamoto?

565
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:20,166
I will do my best!

566
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:22,166
Here goes.

567
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:23,766
Question number 10!

568
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:29,366
Conan Doyle brings to mind Sherlock Holmes,

569
00:26:29,366 --> 00:26:32,266
Masashi Yokomizo brings to mind Kousuke Kindaiji.

570
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:34,466
Then what does Ranpo Edogawa bring to mind?

571
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:39,366
-She did it! -Yes, Ms. Okino.

572
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:45,966
Akechi, Akechi!

573
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:48,166
Too bad, Ms. Okino, you're disqualified.

574
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:51,066
The top prize winners are Ms. Kazuka Inoue and Ms. Azusa Yamamoto!

575
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:52,666
Let's give them a bit hand!

576
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:55,466
-Congratulations! -Congratulations for both winner.

577
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:56,666
Oh boy.

578
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:59,466
How could she say such a name?

579
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:01,966
Kogoro Mouri!

580
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:05,166
How disappointing.

581
00:27:22,966 --> 00:27:24,766
Next Conan's Hint:

582
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:27,466
"Roma letters".

583
00:27:27,466 --> 00:27:28,966
The next episode involves a spider house.

584
00:27:28,966 --> 00:27:30,066
Are there going to be that many spies?

585
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:32,166
He's talking about the insect!
