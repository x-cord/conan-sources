00:00:17,828 --> 00:00:20,128
You're such an annoying brat!

3
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:22,515
You're acting suspicious.

4
00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:23,916
There's nothing suspicious about me!

5
00:00:26,117 --> 00:00:28,317

"Signed, Toyoko."

9
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:40,082
It's an invitation from a fan.

10
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,582
So you trim your nose hairs to go eat monja in Tsukishima?

11
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,282
It's my first time meeting her. I want to look nice.

12
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:49,382
You mean perving on someone you're meeting for the first time?

13
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,183
Perving?

14
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:04,482
Honestly, there's a little bit of that.

15
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:05,882
So you admit it.

16
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:07,383
I do.

17
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:11,182
I want monja, too.

18
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:12,683
What?

19
00:01:17,183 --> 00:01:19,482
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

21
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,382
Kogoro is invited out for monja

22
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,182
and is hired by an unexpected client.

23
00:01:25,183 --> 00:01:26,782
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:26,783 --> 00:01:28,682
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

Let's see...

28
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:35,572
It's this way.

29
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:39,972
I want the deluxe gizzard and garlic monja with cheese.

30
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:43,572
You idiot. Monja aren't supposed to be so luxurious.

31
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:46,972
Monja are a simple food.

32
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:48,773
That's an old-fashioned way of thinking.

33
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,773
It's just down that alleyway.

34
00:04:11,873 --> 00:04:13,772
What is that?

35
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:17,273
Looks like Toyoko's restaurant is over there.

36
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:21,672
What is that old woman doing?

37
00:04:21,673 --> 00:04:24,773
How rude! Who are you?

38
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:32,373
Are you the famous detective Kogoro Mouri?

39
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:38,473
I am indeed the super famous detective Kogoro Mouri.

40
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:44,972
My, my. One moment, please.

41
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:46,772
What?

42
00:04:46,773 --> 00:04:48,973
Does she work here?

43
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:51,973
Excuse us.

44
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:55,472
Excuse me.

45
00:04:55,473 --> 00:04:58,173
Oh, my. I'm Toyoko.

46
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:03,572
I received your invitation.

47
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:06,372
I'm the great detective...

48
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,273
Kogoro Mouri...

49
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:20,973
Pops!

50
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:24,072
Oh, my.

51
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,872
I don't believe it.

52
00:05:25,873 --> 00:05:30,672
The great detective Mouri is overwhelmed by my beauty.

53
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:32,273
I don't think that's it.

54
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:36,172
I'm so upset!

55
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:39,872
Only the great river can heal the wounds on my heart.

56
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,972
The great river has always healed my heart.

57
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:44,273
The great river?

58
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:48,872
The Sumida River has always healed my heart.

59
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:53,673
Sumida River, please soothe this broken heart.

60
00:05:58,073 --> 00:06:00,772
That hurts...

61
00:06:00,773 --> 00:06:03,472
Kid, where's the old woman?

62
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:07,372
She said something about being upset and went to the Sumida River.

63
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:09,172
Sumida River?

64
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:12,872
What? Was she so upset by my rejection

65
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,673
that she's jumping into the Sumida River?

66
00:06:16,473 --> 00:06:17,873
No way.

67
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:25,173
There she is.

68
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:30,972
She's doing that weird dance again.

69
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:35,572
I used be a dancer at the big theater in Ginza.

70
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:36,573
What?

71
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:38,972
The big theater in Ginza.

72
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:39,973
Heard of it?

73
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:42,972
The big theater in Ginza?

74
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:47,672
Come to think of it, I heard there used to be a place like that.

75
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,872
It looked something like this,

76
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:56,273
and featured long lines of beautiful girls dancing.

77
00:06:57,573 --> 00:07:00,772
We can continue our conversation over monja.

78
00:07:00,773 --> 00:07:03,773
"Toyoko's Restaurant."

79
00:07:10,873 --> 00:07:12,472
It's good!

80
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,772
Is it? That's good.

81
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:16,173
Eat all you'd like.

82
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:20,672
Monja and draft beer in the afternoon...

83
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,172
This is great!

84
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:25,573
I think I'll have some, too.

85
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:32,773
It's good. Go, me.

86
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:39,572
Tokyo Barls Collection?

87
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:40,773
What's that?

88
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:45,373
What's wrong, madam?

89
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:48,472
I can't breathe...

90
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:51,072
Hey, are you okay? Pull yourself together!

91
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:52,872
Pops, water!

92
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:53,972
Have some water.

93
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,473
Calm down. Drink slowly.

94
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:04,872
Are you okay, madam?

95
00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:06,372
What's this?

96
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:08,072
The core of a cabbage?

97
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:10,472
Someone was...

98
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:12,972
Someone was trying to kill me.

99
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:15,772
They put the core of a cabbage in my monja!

100
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:17,372
What?

101
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:20,172
I know who the culprit is!

102
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:21,372
The culprit?

103
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:23,572
Calm down, madam.

104
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:26,072
It was one of my childhood friends.

105
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,272
What?

106
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:32,172
They called us the Bufu'usu of Tsukishima.

107
00:08:32,173 --> 00:08:34,572
Tsukishima's...

108
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:36,773
Bufu'usu?

109
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:43,972
I, Toyoko Busujima, was Bu.

110
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:46,672
Eiko Fuda was Fu.

111
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:49,672
Kyoko Ugajin was U.

112
00:08:49,673 --> 00:08:52,073
Yuko Suo was Su.

113
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:55,572
Modern women are no good.

114
00:08:55,573 --> 00:08:59,372
They don't drink skim milk with their school lunches.

115
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,272
Those children know nothing of war.

116
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:05,172
I heard they don't do that at schools anymore.

117
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:06,672
Don't do what?

118
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:11,072
Carry firewood while studying, like Ikkyu.

119
00:09:11,073 --> 00:09:14,972
That guy who came up with the crying nightingale Jomon culture?

120
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:17,672
What? Jomon culture?

121
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:20,372
Bu, you're always showing off your intellect

122
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:23,172
since you're the only one who attended high school.

123
00:09:23,173 --> 00:09:24,472
Yeah.

124
00:09:24,473 --> 00:09:27,272
You've got a big head just because we didn't complete

125
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:29,272
our compulsory education to your satisfaction.

126
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:30,972
I'm stuffing myself until I'm full of this disgusting thing!

127
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:32,872
-Me, too! -Me, too!

128
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,573
Don't stuff yourselves with it!

129
00:09:37,873 --> 00:09:41,572
It must've been one of them.

130
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:43,472
What?

131
00:09:43,473 --> 00:09:44,972
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:44,973 --> 00:09:48,973
Mid-century women can't help but speak their minds.

133
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:51,772
I understand.

134
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:54,472
It's your age that makes you say that.

135
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:58,472
No, you don't. Your age doesn't make you say anything.

136
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,972
Detective Kogoro Mouri.

137
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:04,172
Could you investigate this case?

138
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:08,072
-What? -Here's your pay.

139
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:09,873
I accept!

140
00:10:13,273 --> 00:10:17,772
Will suspect No.1, Eiko Fuda, also known as Fu of Tsukishima,

141
00:10:17,773 --> 00:10:21,773
really appear on the bullet train platform at Tokyo Station?

142
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:25,373
According to Toyoko, also known as Bu of Tsukishima.

143
00:10:30,073 --> 00:10:32,772
Is that her?

144
00:10:32,773 --> 00:10:34,373
Fu of Tsukishima?

145
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:37,673
Excuse me.

146
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:40,872
Are you Eiko Fuda, also known as Fu of Tsukishima?

147
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,472
You're here about Bu.

148
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:44,472
-How did you know? -Did she die?

149
00:10:44,473 --> 00:10:46,672
Not yet.

150
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:50,572
That Bu of Tsukishima is as tough as ever.

151
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:52,472
Do you resent her for some reason?

152
00:10:52,473 --> 00:10:54,172
Of course I do.

153
00:10:54,173 --> 00:11:00,273
During middle school, I was dating ping pong team captain Cho.

154
00:11:12,073 --> 00:11:16,473
Let him break up with Eiko...

155
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:21,672
Break up with Eiko...

156
00:11:21,673 --> 00:11:25,572
Break up...

157
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:29,573
Fine, I'll do it! I'll break up with Eiko!

158
00:11:31,673 --> 00:11:34,873
I see. I'm sorry about...

159
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:38,273
Over there.

160
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:41,572
Please don't jog on the station platform!

161
00:11:41,573 --> 00:11:43,973
It's very dangerous!

162
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:51,572
Suspect No.2, Kyoko Ugajin, also known as U of Tsukishima,

163
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:54,073
butchers tuna at Toyonaka Market.

164
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:09,972
You're here about Bu, aren't you?

165
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:12,372
I'm surprised you knew.

166
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:14,772
Eiko called me.

167
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:17,772
She said a detective came to ask her about Bu.

168
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:20,272
So you do resent her for some reason.

169
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,872
Of course I resent that nincompoop.

170
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:28,473
During middle school, I was dating baseball team captain Fuji.

171
00:12:31,973 --> 00:12:34,873
What a heavy roller.

172
00:12:35,873 --> 00:12:38,972
Break up with Kyoko and date me instead!

173
00:12:38,973 --> 00:12:41,772
-What? -If you won't date me,

174
00:12:41,773 --> 00:12:43,673
then kill me!

175
00:12:45,773 --> 00:12:47,573
Kill me!

176
00:12:48,673 --> 00:12:50,272
Kill me!

177
00:12:50,273 --> 00:12:52,972
Push that roller over me!

178
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,473
Okay!

179
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:59,272
I will have my revenge.

180
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:02,272
Eko Eko Azarak!

181
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:04,873
She's awfully energetic.

182
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:17,626
Suspect No.3, Yuko Suo, also known as Su of Tsukishima, is...

183
00:13:17,627 --> 00:13:20,726
Hello, ni hao, guten tag.

184
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:23,226
I've got great souvenirs.

185
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:27,026
Good stuff from Mt. Fuji, good stuff from Hokkaido.

186
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:30,626
You, boss. I've got good stuff from Nikko, too.

187
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:34,627
I'm not your boss, and I'm not a foreign tourist.

188
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:42,326
During middle school, I was dating...

189
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:45,427
The basketball team captain, who she stole from you?

190
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:53,026
During middle school, I was dating judo team captain Ban.

191
00:13:53,027 --> 00:13:57,027
Toyoko Busujima... I mean, Bu of Tsukishima.

192
00:13:58,427 --> 00:14:00,126
That hurts!

193
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:01,326
"Anti-itch Cream."

194
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:04,227
This medicine should work.

195
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:08,726
-It's working! -I saw you!

196
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:11,627
I saw you doing something embarrassing!

197
00:14:14,627 --> 00:14:16,326
Don't tell anyone.

198
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:17,926
If you don't break up with Yuko

199
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:20,726
and starting dating me instead, I might.

200
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:25,327
Don't tell anyone...

201
00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:35,326
Something's not right.

202
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:42,226
All three of the women named as suspects resent Toyoko,

203
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:45,927
but all three of them resent her for the same reason.

204
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:52,626
During middle school, I was dating ping pong team captain Cho.

205
00:14:52,627 --> 00:14:58,226
During middle school, I was dating baseball team captain Fuji.

206
00:14:58,227 --> 00:15:01,626
During middle school, I was dating...

207
00:15:01,627 --> 00:15:04,826
The basketball team captain, who she stole from you?

208
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:09,527
During middle school, I was dating judo team captain Ban.

209
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:13,426
Furthermore, Yuko said the exact same thing

210
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:17,026
after Pops' interruption.

211
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:19,826
But why did those three...

212
00:15:19,827 --> 00:15:24,026
No, including Toyoko, it's the four of them.

213
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:26,226
Hey, kid.

214
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:29,926
What are you scowling and thinking about?

215
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:32,526
It's simple.

216
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:35,326
Those three women conspired

217
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:37,826
to put a cabbage core in the monja

218
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:41,126
to get their revenge.

219
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:42,726
But then...

220
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:44,326
I know.

221
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:47,326
We're dealing with women who don't have long left to live.

222
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:49,226
I give them a proper talking to,

223
00:15:49,227 --> 00:15:51,026
make them reflect on their actions,

224
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:54,427
and throw a proper sushi party with my pay.

225
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:58,127
"Toyoko's Restaurant."

226
00:15:58,128 --> 00:15:59,426
What?

227
00:15:59,427 --> 00:16:04,326
So it was Eiko, Kyoko, and Yuko who tried to kill me

228
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:06,727
by putting the cabbage core in my monja?

229
00:16:08,227 --> 00:16:11,827
The great Kogoro Mouri doesn't make mistakes!

230
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:15,326
What happened to being proper?

231
00:16:15,327 --> 00:16:18,026
By the way, Detective Mouri.

232
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:19,426
Yes?

233
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:23,726
I know I should go to the local police,

234
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:26,326
but they're so unreliable.

235
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:30,426
Could you ask your friends at the MPD to handle it?

236
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:32,226
What?

237
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:33,927
But...

238
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:38,426
My chronic pain!

239
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:40,526
Are you all right?

240
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:43,627
Please. My days are numbered.

241
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:46,427
Your days are numbered?

242
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:52,726
Very well. I'll talk to them.

243
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:54,726
Thank you!

244
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:57,326
I'll bring you another beer.

245
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:59,126
Don't worry about it.

246
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:01,826
He's too easy.

247
00:17:01,827 --> 00:17:03,527
They're not answering.

248
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:08,627
Anyway, why is she doing this?

249
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:13,827
Isn't that...

250
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:17,927
I see!

251
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,027
So that's how it is.

252
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:29,327
"Toyoko's Restaurant."

253
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:32,726
Here's your beer.

254
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:35,226
-Toyoko. -Yes?

255
00:17:35,227 --> 00:17:38,426
Picking up where we left off,

256
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:43,126
when cooking monja, you use two spatulas

257
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:46,726
to finely chop ingredients spread over a hot plate.

258
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:50,326
In other words, even if a cabbage core

259
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:53,226
were mixed in with the ingredients,

260
00:17:53,227 --> 00:17:56,026
it should've been chopped too small

261
00:17:56,027 --> 00:17:58,826
to get caught in your throat by the time you ate it.

262
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:03,226
Therefore, the cabbage core you choked on

263
00:18:03,227 --> 00:18:07,226
must have been put in after you finished preparing the monja.

264
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:09,726
Not only that, but if the core

265
00:18:09,727 --> 00:18:12,026
was carelessly thrown into the ingredients,

266
00:18:12,027 --> 00:18:14,926
the boy or I could've eaten it.

267
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:19,526
There would be no guarantee you would choke on it.

268
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:26,326
The only certain way to choke you would be to put it in

269
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:28,427
just before you served yourself.

270
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:34,626
However, this presents a fundamental problem.

271
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:38,626
Would you not notice a cabbage core

272
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:42,527
falling into the bit of monja you were about to eat?

273
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:50,626
In other words, the four of you worked together

274
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:53,527
to cause a commotion by involving me and the police.

275
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:57,327
It was all a lie.

276
00:18:58,827 --> 00:19:00,427
She's not even here.

277
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:09,027
Does that mean she didn't listen to any of my reasoning?

278
00:19:19,427 --> 00:19:21,427
I knew they'd be here.

279
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:26,526
If the great detective Kogoro Mouri and the MPD

280
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:28,926
get involved in the investigation...

281
00:19:28,927 --> 00:19:32,326
It'll be a huge story! The media will swoop in!

282
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:37,226
Then everyone will be talking about the Tokyo Barls Collection!

283
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:40,226
But won't we be arrested?

284
00:19:40,227 --> 00:19:42,326
We'll cross that bridge when we get there.

285
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:45,526
Should we make a public apology then?

286
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:48,426
Then even more people will be talking about us.

287
00:19:48,427 --> 00:19:51,226
The Barls Collection is guaranteed to be a success!

288
00:19:51,227 --> 00:19:53,826
Maybe we'll be invited to appear on TV.

289
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:56,426
And interviewed by handsome men.

290
00:19:56,427 --> 00:19:59,226
That would really get people talking.

291
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:02,427
The Barls Collection is guaranteed to be a success...

292
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:10,327
Well, whatever.

293
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:13,727
"Toyoko's Restaurant."

294
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:19,126
Hello, Inspector?

295
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:24,126
I'm sorry, but there's something I'd like to discuss with you.

296
00:20:24,127 --> 00:20:28,127
Oh, no. He got a hold of Inspector Megure.

297
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,627
"Toyoko's Restaurant."

298
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:15,826
We just wanted to cheer up all the elderly people

299
00:22:15,827 --> 00:22:19,126
around the country who are our age.

300
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:25,127
We're terribly sorry for the inconvenience our carelessness caused.

301
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:29,327
We're sorry...

302
00:23:11,027 --> 00:23:15,426
No one stands a chance against the Bufu'usu of Tsukishima.

303
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,026
Hey, kid.

304
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:18,726
What are you doing? Let's go.

305
00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:20,326
Okay.

306
00:23:20,327 --> 00:23:23,226
What's wrong with those women?

307
00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:24,826
But it ended well, right?

308
00:23:24,827 --> 00:23:27,026
It'll cheer up some old women.

309
00:23:27,027 --> 00:23:29,426
And besides, didn't you get paid?

310
00:23:29,427 --> 00:23:30,826
Paid?

311
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:34,426
There were just free monja coupons in that envelope.

312
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:36,526
Really?

313
00:23:36,527 --> 00:23:40,527
The Tokyo Barls Collection is guaranteed to be a success!

314
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:44,426
"Next Episode" -Smile, Kagura.

315
00:23:44,427 --> 00:23:45,926
Look happy.

316
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:50,226
I'll earn more likes for you.

317
00:23:50,227 --> 00:23:54,926
Kagura suffered collateral damage about half a month ago.

318
00:23:54,927 --> 00:23:56,026
What?

319
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:58,626
This can't be a coincidence.

320
00:23:58,627 --> 00:24:00,927
-What? -Conan, could it be...

321
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:05,927
I'll expose everything!

322
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:12,727
Next Conan, "The Cost of Likes (Part 1)"
