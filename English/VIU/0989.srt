1
00:00:00,945 --> 00:00:03,384
"Saturday, December 5th.

2
00:00:03,385 --> 00:00:07,125
Today Conan-kun caught a jewel thief.

3
00:00:07,695 --> 00:00:13,315
When I asked him how he did it, he said it was thanks to my illustrated diary.

4
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:16,304
But I don't remember figuring anything out.

5
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:17,925
I wonder why he said that."

6
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:22,534
Find the question that solves the mystery!

7
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:24,864
Apply miraculous detective skills to the secrets of the heart!

8
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:27,114
Hints from Ayumi's illustrated diary save the day!

9
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:28,984
Catch that jewel thief!

10
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:30,654
Always determining the one truth

11
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,314
with the body of a child and the mind of an adult,

12
00:00:32,315 --> 00:00:34,795
his name is Detective Conan!

13
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:20,605
The Case of Ayumi's Illustrated Diary

14
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,749
Conan-kun noticed the jewel thief

15
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,130
while walking through a shopping area on the way to school.

16
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,550
Is something wrong?

17
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,980
Is it your illustrated diary?

18
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,670
Yeah.

19
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:46,690
I'm never sure what to write each day.

20
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,490
What do you guys do?

21
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,619
Just write about whatever you want to eat that day.

22
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,410
Like grilled eel in a bowl, or grilled eel in a box, or quartered grilled eel.

23
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,170
That can't be right.

24
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,029
When I can't decide, I go for a walk.

25
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,960
Don't you end up writing the same thing every day?

26
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,769
I suppose.

27
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,050
As long as I can write something.

28
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,930
Seriously?

29
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,879
What about you, Ai-chan?

30
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,269
It's easy.

31
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,440
A quick search online yields plenty of ideas, like the weather or whatever else.

32
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,730
You simply have to choose whatever you like from among the options.

33
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,230
That doesn't sound right either.

34
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,740
Aw, jeez. What should I do?

35
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,639
Carefully observe all kinds of things,

36
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,239
and you'll discover the truth.

37
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,820
Huh?

38
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,510
You should observe your surroundings in your own way.

39
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,050
I'm sure you'll find something to write about.

40
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,930
Got it. Thanks, Conan-kun.

41
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,530
Hey.

42
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,310
There's a bunch of people over there.

43
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,310
Huh?

44
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,810
What are they doing?

45
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,319
What does Kaneko-san plan to do by stocking something this nice?

46
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,469
He said he hoped it would revitalize the town.

47
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,820
What if someone steals it?

48
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,950
I'm not certain, but it's probably insured.

49
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,960
Right. Of course.

50
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:25,130
Then it'd be no skin off Kaneko-san's nose if it were stolen.

51
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,469
I don't know about that.

52
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,680
But I wonder how much that watch would sell for.

53
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,049
Even if you sold it so it couldn't be traced, it'd probably go for at least 70 million.

54
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,759
70 million?

55
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,690
No way.

56
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:47,190
I heard you can get several times the market price if you sell it to a collector.

57
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,200
If I got that much money, I'd take my family to Hawaii.

58
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,520
So this is what drew the small crowd.

59
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,439
It's a big watch.

60
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,750
It's so shiny.

61
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,210
I wonder how many eel bowls this is worth.

62
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,690
Come on, kids.

63
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,259
Isn't it almost time for school? Get moving.

64
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,930
Okay.

65
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,470
According to Conan-kun,

66
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:23,240
the jewel thief was trying to steal the big shiny watch from Jewelry Kaneko.

67
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,730
Blue Diamond Limited Tourbillon Cage No. 3.

68
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:37,080
Made by renowned watchmaker Soumillon, there's only five of them in the world.

69
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,370
No wonder the grocer was so excited.

70
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,849
It's quite the luxury watch for a small town jeweler.

71
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,380
Enough to create a commotion among ordinary people.

72
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,070
I hope it doesn't become the target of any ill-intentioned people.

73
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,679
Did you beat that game?

74
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,049
Yeah, I did.

75
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,900
Huh?

76
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:08,249
It's Detective Takagi.

77
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,400
Hey, you're right.

78
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,739
Make sure you lock your doors.

79
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,650
Will do.

80
00:06:13,651 --> 00:06:14,900
Detective Takagi.

81
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,200
Conan-kun, you kids.

82
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,909
What are you doing here?

83
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,830
Is it about the luxury watch at the store next door?

84
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,080
Not exactly.

85
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,960
Then what it is?

86
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,839
There have been a lot of burglaries in this area lately.

87
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,920
I'm handing out these fliers to alert the locals.

88
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,869
Anyway, that's why we're handing out these fliers.

89
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,520
Thank you, I appreciate it.

90
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,900
Hey, Mister. We heard the watch in your store window is really expensive.

91
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,199
Would you like to take a look?

92
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,409
Can we?

93
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,190
Yeah. After all, you seem to be friends with this police officer.

94
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,720
Soumillon's masterpiece from the height of his career.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,979
Blue Diamond Limited Tourbillon Cage No. 3.

96
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,310
Well? Beautiful, isn't it?

97
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,979
Wow!

98
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,439
It looks different up close.

99
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,310
It's so sparkly.

100
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,690
Kaneko-san, how's your security?

101
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,699
Don't worry.

102
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,450
My security is absolutely secure.

103
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,700
I have security cameras covering every inch of the store.

104
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,710
The footage is stored on the cloud,

105
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,260
so you don't need to worry about intruders erasing it.

106
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,710
Outside of business hours, I keep the sturdy shutters closed.

107
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,330
I also have infrared and pressure sensors installed.

108
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,739
The store window where the watch is displayed is made of tempered glass,

109
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,580
and a code is required to open this door.

110
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,329
All of these systems are monitored by computer.

111
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,240
If anything happens, the security company will come running.

112
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:30,189
I see. With security this tight, it's not possible for your average burglar to break in.

113
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,120
Indeed.

114
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,439
But nothing's for certain.

115
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,630
Please be careful.

116
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,000
Understood.

117
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,820
Excuse me.

118
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:42,890
Now then.

119
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,030
Hey, kids—

120
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,200
Detective Takagi.

121
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,460
Don't you think that watch is at risk?

122
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,479
But security is tight,

123
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,280
and it's hard to imagine jewelry theft going well in this day and age.

124
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,500
Hey, kids.

125
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,230
If you're not busy, could you help me hand out these fliers?

126
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,149
Bye!

127
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,790
Hey, w-wait!

128
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,540
Nothing of note happened for several days after that.

129
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,660
But one day...

130
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,130
Cafe Haronbo

131
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,650
Hup.

132
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,520
Good morning, kids.

133
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,020
Good morning!

134
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,289
Don't take any detours. Head straight to school.

135
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,930
Okay!

136
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,849
What's that sound?

137
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,020
Maybe it's construction work.

138
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,389
Looks like they're renovating.

139
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:00,920
Yeah.

140
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,430
I don't see anything suspicious.

141
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,649
Suspicious? Like what?

142
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,969
Like pretending to do construction work so they can rob the jewelry store?

143
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,529
What? Is that true, Conan-kun?

144
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,050
I don't know that yet.

145
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,000
Let's check it out for ourselves.

146
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,400
Conan-kun?

147
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,900
Excuse me.

148
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,790
What is it, kids?

149
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,780
As you can see, I'm renovating my store.

150
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,130
The president of the engineering firm over there is named Kumazawa.

151
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,370
We've known each other since middle school, so he's given me a special discount.

152
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,319
Um, is it possible that...

153
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,799
That you're pretending to renovate your store

154
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,769
so you can steal the watch from the jeweler next door?

155
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:52,090
What?

156
00:10:52,091 --> 00:10:54,530
Don't be rude, you two.

157
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,020
Marvelous.

158
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:03,519
If I punched a hole in that wall and stole some jewels, I'd be rich.

159
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,639
Then I could open a store overseas.

160
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,030
What a masterpiece.

161
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,750
Maybe I'll become a professional thief.

162
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,640
I'm joking.

163
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,299
I may not look like it, but the only thing I can do is make coffee.

164
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,090
I'm too clumsy to be a thief.

165
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,180
Who are they?

166
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,180
They're Kumazawa's sons.

167
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,180
I've known them since they were in diapers.

168
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,150
You suspect them, too?

169
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,990
Well, uh...

170
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,520
Hello.

171
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,239
Cheetah Transport here.

172
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,399
Hello again.

173
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,469
Could you sign or stamp here, please?

174
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,450
Sure thing.

175
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,849
Thanks for the food.

176
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,069
Come back once we've finished renovations.

177
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,490
Okay.

178
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,210
Well? You heard what he said.

179
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,599
He's a little suspicious.

180
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,220
He didn't seem like a bad person.

181
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,440
The juice was good.

182
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:17,590
It's certainly risky to rob the jewelry store next door.

183
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,879
But he made jokes about it earlier.

184
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,480
I'm not sure what he actually thinks.

185
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,230
What's got you kids down?

186
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,840
Ma'am.

187
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,200
Here.

188
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,030
Oranges?

189
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,559
On the house.

190
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,290
Have some oranges and cheer up.

191
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,819
Head home once you finish those.

192
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,040
Okay.

193
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,460
Welcome, ma'am. What can I get you?

194
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,049
Then nothing in particular happened for several days.

195
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,969
But while Conan-kun thought hard about it,

196
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,580
the culprit's plans were steadily advancing.

197
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,360
Jewelry Kaneko

198
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,099
Does this mean there wasn't anyone

199
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,289
who thought about stealing that watch?

200
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,539
Maybe.

201
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,670
You think so?

202
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,870
I think the owner of the café is suspicious.

203
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,630
I think the contractors are suspicious.

204
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,550
What if it's actually the lady from the produce store?

205
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,550
You should also consider the possibility that the jeweler might pretend to rob himself.

206
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,550
He might do it for the insurance money.

207
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,810
You're right, Haibara-san. It's certainly possible.

208
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,310
Let's all keep an eye out so there is no burglary.

209
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,450
Yeah!

210
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,969
With no crime, there wasn't anything Conan-kun could do,

211
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,920
but several days later, that fateful day would come.

212
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:28,263
Conan-kun.

213
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:31,173
Ayumi-chan.

214
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:34,583
Conan-kun, read this.

215
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:38,783
Your illustrated diary?

216
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:48,232
Thanks, Conan-kun.

217
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:48,773
Huh?

218
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:54,052
Thanks to you, I think I got better at keeping an illustrated diary.

219
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:55,153
Because of me?

220
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:59,163
Did you forget what you told me?

221
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:04,982
Carefully observe all kinds of things, and you'll discover the truth.

222
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:05,773
Huh?

223
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:11,533
You should observe your surroundings in your own way.

224
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:15,233
I'm sure you'll find something to write about.

225
00:15:15,773 --> 00:15:17,602
Is that right?

226
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:18,853
Yeah.

227
00:15:19,643 --> 00:15:25,762
Since then, like you said, I've been carefully observing my surroundings every day.

228
00:15:25,763 --> 00:15:31,233
When I started writing exactly what I saw and felt, I got better at it.

229
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:34,323
What's this?

230
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:37,203
Is something wrong?

231
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:40,673
Did something happen, Conan-kun?

232
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:42,193
Found it.

233
00:15:43,253 --> 00:15:45,162
What about that drawing?

234
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:48,213
Didn't Michiyo-chan from the class next door—

235
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:51,543
Ayumi-chan, what's Michiyo-chan's family name?

236
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:53,963
I think it's Ogino.

237
00:15:55,483 --> 00:15:56,183
All right.

238
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:57,292
Conan-kun?

239
00:15:57,293 --> 00:15:58,553
Where are you going?

240
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:03,473
Ogino Produce Store

241
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:09,183
What's gotten into you, Conan-kun?

242
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:13,132
Seems like you figured something out.

243
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:14,053
Yeah.

244
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:16,562
Thanks to Ayumi-chan.

245
00:16:16,563 --> 00:16:17,463
Huh?

246
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:21,163
There's still a lot I need to confirm, though.

247
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:23,713
But that's definitely it.

248
00:16:57,693 --> 00:17:01,203
Almost. I'm almost there.

249
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:05,203
You just wait, my little jewels.

250
00:18:02,713 --> 00:18:03,993
Hold it right there.

251
00:18:05,003 --> 00:18:08,223
You nearly pulled it off. Too bad.

252
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:13,072
You can't escape.

253
00:18:13,073 --> 00:18:14,943
We've already called the police.

254
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:16,253
Damn it.

255
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:23,762
You heard an expensive luxury watch was on display at Jewelry Kaneko.

256
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:25,323
While waiting to see what would happen,

257
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:30,573
you heard Café Haronbo was renovating its store and came up with your plan.

258
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:33,353
Isn't that right,

259
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:38,823
Cheetah Transport courier Fujioka Yuji-san?

260
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:42,393
This was the plan you came up with.

261
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,402
The renovation work being done at the café next to the jewelry store

262
00:18:46,403 --> 00:18:47,893
would generate a lot of noise.

263
00:18:48,553 --> 00:18:50,762
You decided to use that noise as a camouflage

264
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:54,673
to enter the jeweler from the produce store on the opposite side.

265
00:18:56,143 --> 00:18:59,142
As long as the cafe was undergoing renovations,

266
00:18:59,143 --> 00:19:02,903
no matter how much noise you made, no one would suspect you.

267
00:19:03,923 --> 00:19:07,843
Then you just needed the produce store workers to go away.

268
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:14,602
You probably learned the grocer loves prize contests from that conversation

269
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:20,383
and invited her and her family to Hawaii by lying and telling her she'd won a prize.

270
00:19:22,523 --> 00:19:26,972
Even if you sold it so it couldn't be traced, it'd probably go for at least 70 million.

271
00:19:26,973 --> 00:19:28,772
70 million?

272
00:19:28,773 --> 00:19:29,653
No way.

273
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:33,023
I heard you can get several times the market price if you sell it to a collector.

274
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:38,403
If I got that much money, I'd take my family to Hawaii.

275
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:43,222
Speaking of which, did you win that trip to Hawaii you mentioned the other day?

276
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,403
I don't know yet.

277
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:48,412
I hope you win.

278
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:50,903
I'd like to win a trip to Hawaii.

279
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,712
H-How do you know that?

280
00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:55,253
What's wrong with you?

281
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:58,252
You mean you didn't see that note she posted?

282
00:19:58,253 --> 00:19:59,173
What?

283
00:19:59,743 --> 00:20:05,973
It says the shop is temporary closed because they're on a family trip.

284
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:16,183
That must've been a lot of work.

285
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:22,362
You've been digging for five days since they went on their trip, haven't you?

286
00:20:22,363 --> 00:20:22,943
Damn it!

287
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,693
Who are you kids?

288
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,412
Edogawa Conan—

289
00:20:27,413 --> 00:20:28,582
Yoshida Ayumi.

290
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,073
Huh?

291
00:20:30,243 --> 00:20:31,582
Kojima Genta.

292
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,833
Tsuburaya Mitsuhiko.

293
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,213
We are the Detective Boys!

294
00:20:38,143 --> 00:20:38,833
That's us.

295
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,793
And so, the case was solved.

296
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:49,953
The culprit Fujioka-san was arrested by Detective Takagi.

297
00:20:50,693 --> 00:20:55,782
Conan-kun said he figured out the culprit's trick

298
00:20:55,783 --> 00:21:01,493
from my illustrations of Michiyo-chan and the three buildings in a row.

299
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:06,172
He deduced that the culprit must know a lot about the area

300
00:21:06,173 --> 00:21:09,052
and began to suspect Fujioka-san the courier

301
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:12,613
who was having a conversation in front of the jeweler.

302
00:21:13,103 --> 00:21:15,122
Apparently the deciding factor

303
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:20,053
was that he accurately named the black market price.

304
00:21:21,173 --> 00:21:24,792
Conan-kun called the Cheetah Transport company

305
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:29,663
and determined that Fujioka-san had missed work for five days.

306
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:34,222
Conan-kun said he couldn't have solved this case

307
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:37,872
without my illustrated diary.

308
00:21:37,873 --> 00:21:39,282
Yay!

309
00:21:39,283 --> 00:21:46,512
In other words, this was my first big success as a member of the Detective Boys.

310
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,623
Victory!

311
00:21:48,103 --> 00:21:51,612
And that's how the Detective Boys

312
00:21:51,613 --> 00:21:56,303
prevented a burglary before it happened.

313
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:26,232
Detective Takagi treated us to lots of tasty food at Poirot to thank us for preventing a crime.

314
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:28,823
Thanks for the food!

315
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:34,352
Hey, wait. This isn't an all-you-can-eat restaurant, kids.

316
00:23:34,353 --> 00:23:37,362
But can't Ayumi-chan eat all she wants?

317
00:23:37,363 --> 00:23:38,893
I suppose so.

318
00:23:39,463 --> 00:23:40,683
Ahem.

319
00:23:44,563 --> 00:23:50,273
He's really a great detective who can solve any case, right?

320
00:23:51,753 --> 00:23:55,153
Why don't you show a little more consideration for your family?

321
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:59,413
You mentioned something about the gears of tragedy.

322
00:23:59,793 --> 00:24:03,163
It wasn't you who turned them, but the culprit.

323
00:24:05,213 --> 00:24:06,413
That must be it.

324
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:12,863
The next episode of Conan is "The Automatic Tragedy, Part One!"
