1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,770
The haunted storeroom where anything you put inside it

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,370
disappears in no time at all.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,370
We, the detective squad, revealed the secret and found the thief

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,770
who was hiding in the hidden room.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,070
I couldn't help wondering why the deductions of Mitsuhiko and the others

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,970
were right to the point.

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,870
But it turned out that they were getting hints from Heiji Hattori

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,870
who just happened to stop by at the detective agency.

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,570
What on earth brought him here?

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,370
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,570
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,570
Kazuha's lucky charm that she put her hidden feelings into

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,670
and that she is keeping a secret from Heiji has disappeared?

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,470
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,370
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,370
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:25,508
"The Whereabouts of the Embarrassing Lucky Charm (Part 1)".

18
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:30,108
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Huh? You're searching for somebody?

19
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,808
You mean you came all the way to Tokyo just to look for somebody?

20
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:35,208
Right!

21
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,108
The person I'm looking for

22
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:41,908
is a junior at Teitan University, called Teruaki Kunimatsu.

23
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:43,108
It seems that his parents' house

24
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:46,208
is next door to Kazuha's house, so...

25
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,708
-Really? -Yep.

26
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,908
Why are you looking for him?

27
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:55,108
You see, he plays tennis.

28
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:59,808
But when Mr. Kunimatsu came back to Osaka last holiday...

29
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,208
Huh? A lucky charm?

30
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,208
Yeah!

31
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,808
Will you make one for me so that I can win the next tennis tournament?

32
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:10,108
Why don't you ask your mother to make it for you?

33
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:12,408
"Teruaki Kunimatsu (20)" -I want yours, Kazuha.

34
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:13,808
"Teitan University second-year student" -Your lucky charms

35
00:03:13,808 --> 00:03:16,208
are rumored to be very effective.

36
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,008
I really don't want to lose the tournament that's coming up!

37
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:22,208
So, please! I beg you!

38
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:29,508
And? You missed giving the lucky charm to that guy?

39
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:33,108
No, I did get to give it to him,

40
00:03:33,108 --> 00:03:34,708
but there was a mistake.

41
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,108
You see, this idiot!

42
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:38,408
Watch your mouth!

43
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:40,308
A mistake?

44
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:43,508
Yeah, the thing is...

45
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,808
The guy was in front of the Akido practice hall that Kazuha goes to,

46
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:50,208
and staring through the window of the hall.

47
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,008
I thought he was a lewd guy waiting to attack girls,

48
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:53,208
I was going to get him.

49
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:56,908
You asked Kazuha to make you a lucky charm?

50
00:03:56,908 --> 00:04:00,808
Yeah, she promised to give it to me today, but...

51
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:03,608
I don't think she can give it to you yet, for sometime.

52
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:06,808
Kazuha's got an Akido level up test coming up,

53
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:09,908
so she said she'd be staying till late for practice today.

54
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:12,308
That's why her mother asked me to bring this thermos to her,

55
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:14,508
so here I am.

56
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:17,108
Sometime ago, that dork over practiced

57
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:21,208
and collapsed from dehydration, you see.

58
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,508
But, that puts me in a fix.

59
00:04:23,508 --> 00:04:27,608
It's about time I have to board the bullet train back.

60
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:30,408
I'll go get it for you, then.

61
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:31,908
If she meant to give it to you,

62
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:34,508
I'm sure it's in her bag.

63
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:35,908
"Dressing room"

64
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,808
Here it is!

65
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:39,008
This must be it!

66
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:42,308
"Lucky charm" -Don't tell me...

67
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:45,408
that the lucky charm was the one that you really cherished?

68
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:47,808
Right! It's the lucky charm that I also made for Heiji

69
00:04:47,808 --> 00:04:51,108
with the piece of chain from a handcuff inside it!

70
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:54,008
And this idiot mistakenly gave that lucky charm away!

71
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:55,208
I couldn't help, could I?

72
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,208
I didn't know anything about the lucky charm, you know.

73
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,908
You don't have to know a thing about it!

74
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:00,008
Who on earth would attach a lucky charm

75
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,508
meant to be given away to the handle of the school bag?

76
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:04,508
What the fuss!

77
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:06,808
You made that lucky charm too, didn't you?

78
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:08,208
It probably doesn't bring that much good lucky anyway.

79
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,008
Just what're you talking about?

80
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:11,408
I always had it on me,

81
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:13,008
so nothing bad happened to me,

82
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:15,608
but when you lent that lucky charm to Conan,

83
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:18,108
you were shot and went through hell, didn't you?

84
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:20,908
Well, thanks to that lucky charm,

85
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:24,308
I was saved despite being stabbed with a knife.

86
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:26,108
Even the time you fell into the ocean!

87
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:29,608
Wasn't it thanks to the power of the lucky charm that you were saved?

88
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:30,908
That lucky charm could've been responsible

89
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:33,208
for my falling into the ocean to begin with.

90
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,208
At any rate,

91
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,408
if something happens to me because I lost that lucky charm...

92
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:39,008
Heiji! I'm going to curse you for life!

93
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:41,508
That's why I told you that I'd come to look for that guy alone

94
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,808
and get the lucky charm back,

95
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:46,408
so I don't see why you had to come along.

96
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:51,908
Well, so you see, that's because... Well...

97
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:55,708
Okay, okay. We'll all go to look for him tomorrow.

98
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,208
But why do you have to look for him?

99
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,508
You already know where his university is and where he lives, don't you?

100
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:03,108
Well, the thing is,

101
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:07,208
we haven't been able to get in touch with him since a few days ago.

102
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,608
He's absent from class at the university, too.

103
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:12,908
And it seems that he hasn't come back to his apartment for a while too.

104
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:17,208
In other words, his whereabouts are unknown.

105
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,208
I hope he hasn't gotten involved in some strange incident or something.

106
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:24,808
Well, you guys go over to his university tomorrow then.

107
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:31,108
"Teitan University"

108
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,808
"Tennis Club" -Kunimatsu?

109
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:40,308
Come to think of it, I haven't seen him around lately.

110
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:42,808
And haven't you heard of why he hasn't been around lately?

111
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:44,708
He was hurt.

112
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,208
He broke his right hand during practice

113
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,508
before the tournament.

114
00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:51,808
Broke a bone?

115
00:06:51,808 --> 00:06:54,308
Maybe he tried too hard and got hurt?

116
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:55,908
Just the opposite!

117
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,508
He was acting absentminded

118
00:06:57,508 --> 00:06:58,908
and didn't seem to be concentrating much.

119
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:02,408
He was so out to get before the holidays and yet...

120
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:04,908
Which means that Mr. Kunimatsu's been hospitalized?

121
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:07,908
No, his wound wasn't that bad.

122
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:09,008
But he couldn't manage to take care of things at home,

123
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:13,008
so he said that he'd be staying over at the place of a friend.

124
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:18,108
Yeah, I'm letting Kunimatsu stay over at my place.

125
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:20,408
I was telling him to get out of here as soon as he could,

126
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:22,508
though because the room is too small to accommodate both of us.

127
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,708
Then, is Mr. Kunimatsu inside?

128
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:26,708
No.

129
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,708
I told him that it's no use staying confined to the room all afternoon,

130
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,408
so to go someplace.

131
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,108
Then, he went out.

132
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:36,208
-Where to? -Beats me.

133
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,008
He used to like sports,

134
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:41,308
so maybe he's watching a match somewhere?

135
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:43,708
He seemed really excited when he called a while ago too.

136
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,208
-What? -He called?

137
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,108
This is just great! Luck has come my way at last!

138
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:50,908
I'll show you proof from now.

139
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:54,608
He told me to come to a sports cafe in Shibuya.

140
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,408
If you came to see him,

141
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:58,008
would you like to come along with me?

142
00:07:58,008 --> 00:07:59,508
You don't mind?

143
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:01,208
Please take us with you!

144
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,908
And didn't that Mr. Kunimatsu

145
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:06,508
mention anything about a lucky charm?

146
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:10,608
Yeah, he said he had a girl who lives in his hometown make it for him

147
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:12,908
and he's been keeping it in his wallet ever since.

148
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:14,008
Really?

149
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:16,508
Then, you can get it back from him right away.

150
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:19,008
I'll go get ready then, so can you wait a while?

151
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:20,508
-Okay. -Okay.

152
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:24,308
Talk about a fast solution.

153
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:27,808
It's a bit too bad that we found him so soon.

154
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:28,908
Huh?

155
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:32,208
You came along because you wanted to stay with Heiji, right?

156
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,208
No, no!

157
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,408
Huh? That's not it?

158
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:40,408
Well, I guess there was a little bit of that too, but...

159
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:42,508
The real reason is that

160
00:08:42,508 --> 00:08:44,308
inside the lucky charm...

161
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:47,508
What?

162
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:49,308
You had a picture inside it?

163
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:53,908
What about a picture?

164
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,508
I was just saying that this picture of Mr. Kunimatsu

165
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:58,308
looks quite handsome.

166
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,708
If I let him go alone and get the lucky charm back,

167
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,708
he'd confirm it by looking inside, wouldn't he?

168
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,408
To be sure that it was really mine.

169
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:09,708
Then, he'll find out

170
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:13,708
that I secretly have a picture of him inside the lucky charm.

171
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,608
I came along to prevent that from happening.

172
00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:18,008
If I check inside it myself,

173
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:19,908
Heiji wouldn't have to see it.

174
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:24,208
Okay! If Mr. Kunimatsu tries to give the lucky charm to Heiji,

175
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,108
I'll try to somehow get in the way.

176
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,208
Thank you!

177
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,608
But...

178
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:31,308
I might get flustered and give it to Heiji.

179
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:32,708
What?

180
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:33,808
Just joking.

181
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:36,508
Come on, stop being like that, Ran!

182
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:38,708
What's she getting all carried away about?

183
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:42,108
Maybe she's just happy that she's getting her cherished lucky charm back?

184
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:47,508
I can't figure out what's so good

185
00:09:47,508 --> 00:09:50,108
about a lucky charm like this.

186
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:52,508
Talking of lucky charms...

187
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:57,508
Did Shinichi ever touch Heiji's lucky charm?

188
00:09:57,508 --> 00:10:00,208
Remember, during the incident that involved the messenger of Death,

189
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,208
Heiji said that he checked Shinichi's fingerprints

190
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,208
that were on the piece of chain that was inside the lucky charm,

191
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:10,408
against the fingerprints of the culprit,

192
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:13,408
who pretended to be him.

193
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:17,808
But the one who touched the piece of chain that was inside

194
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:19,608
was Conan, wasn't it?

195
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:22,908
I'm sure he lent it to Kudo along the way, don't you?

196
00:10:22,908 --> 00:10:24,808
It would be strange otherwise, wouldn't it?

197
00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:28,008
True.

198
00:10:30,908 --> 00:10:33,708
I'm sure it was a little bit up ahead.

199
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:37,408
There it is, over there.

200
00:10:37,408 --> 00:10:39,008
That sports cafe.

201
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:41,808
What's up? Police cars are parked there.

202
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,108
Make sure no one intrudes on the scene.

203
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:45,108
Officer Takagi!

204
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:46,608
Conan!

205
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:48,708
Heiji too.

206
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,008
Is something wrong?

207
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:51,808
It's a case of assault and battery.

208
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:53,008
A man wearing a cast on his arm

209
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:54,808
was found beaten in the toilet compartment.

210
00:10:54,808 --> 00:10:57,508
A man wearing a cast on his arm?

211
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:59,108
Don't tell me it's him.

212
00:10:59,808 --> 00:11:03,408
Right, right. He looks like this.

213
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:04,608
Why?

214
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:07,208
If so, we're not outsiders.

215
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,108
Let me go check the site.

216
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:18,108
So, Mr. Kunimatsu was seated on the toilet seat?

217
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:19,608
Yeah.

218
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:23,008
It seems that he was bleeding from the head and slack.

219
00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:27,608
And, is Mr. Kunimatsu alright?

220
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:29,308
He was taken to the hospital

221
00:11:29,308 --> 00:11:30,808
and is unconscious in critical condition.

222
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:32,008
Oh, no.

223
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:34,308
Why Mr. Kunimatsu...

224
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:38,008
We don't know who and why he was beaten

225
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:42,408
but the time he was beaten was between 19:55 to 20:05,

226
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:44,208
during a period of 10 minutes.

227
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,808
Talk about precise.

228
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:48,708
Since today just happened to be the first anniversary of the shop,

229
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,408
party crackers were handed out to all the customers who came

230
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:52,608
and at 20:00 sharp,

231
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:55,008
they seemed to have held a simple celebration party.

232
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:58,908
The employee began passing out the crackers five minutes before 20:00.

233
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:00,808
A party cracker was given to the victim who was drinking at the counter

234
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:03,808
and then was told about the 1st anniversary of the shop.

235
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:06,508
It seems he stood up to go to the men's room,

236
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:08,208
leaving the party cracker as is on the counter.

237
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:11,308
And, since even after letting off the party crackers,

238
00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:13,308
he didn't come back from the men's room,

239
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:15,308
they went to check on him,

240
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:17,608
found a blood-smeared Mr. Kunimatsu

241
00:12:17,608 --> 00:12:19,508
and called the police?

242
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:23,008
Yeah, it seems that the employee heard strange sounds

243
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,908
and groaning mixed with the sound of the crackers

244
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:28,108
coming from the men's room too.

245
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:30,208
Then, why didn't the employee who heard it

246
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,308
go to the men's room right away?

247
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:36,308
It seems he was busy retrieving the used crackers.

248
00:12:36,308 --> 00:12:40,608
Then, were there any customers who left the shop during the ten minutes?

249
00:12:40,608 --> 00:12:42,808
No.

250
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:43,808
Because it seems that

251
00:12:43,808 --> 00:12:45,608
the cash register wasn't working well since before 20:00,

252
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:48,308
so the customers seem to have been stuck.

253
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:54,308
Which means that the culprit is still inside?

254
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:58,508
Yeah, that's why we're going to talk to each and every person here and...

255
00:12:58,508 --> 00:13:00,708
There's no need to do so!

256
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:05,708
Maybe we'll be able to figure out who the culprit is right away.

257
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,208
How?

258
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,208
First...

259
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,408
Make the customers...

260
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:15,708
This is Officer Takagi from the Metropolitan Police Department.

261
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,508
You already know that just a while ago,

262
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:21,608
a case of assault and battery occurred here, don't you?

263
00:13:21,608 --> 00:13:22,908
Before I start an investigation,

264
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:24,608
I would like to ask you a simple question,

265
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:27,508
so please close your eyes and listen well.

266
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:29,508
It seems that a small party was held

267
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,608
at this shop tonight at around 20:00.

268
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:34,908
Please bring me some evidence showing that such a party was held.

269
00:13:34,908 --> 00:13:36,508
After I count to three,

270
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:40,008
please bring the evidence quickly and show it to me.

271
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:41,608
Are you ready?

272
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:44,908
One, two, three.

273
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:48,808
What the...

274
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:52,408
I see, three people.

275
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:55,108
Well, we sort of narrowed the suspect down, I guess?

276
00:13:58,594 --> 00:14:03,194
Then, I will ask all three of you some questions standing up,

277
00:14:03,194 --> 00:14:04,894
so please come this way.

278
00:14:04,894 --> 00:14:06,494
Questions?

279
00:14:06,494 --> 00:14:08,894
Why just the three of us?

280
00:14:08,894 --> 00:14:11,294
Please explain, will you?

281
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:15,594
Mr. Kunimatsu went to the men's room at five minutes before 8:00.

282
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:18,094
After that, the employee here hears a strange sound

283
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:21,194
and groaning comes from the men's room.

284
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,194
Ten minutes later when he goes to check the men's room,

285
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:27,894
it seems he found Mr. Kunimatsu bleeding from the head.

286
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:32,294
Therefore, the crime happened at 20:00 sharp.

287
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:34,894
And so, what does that have to do with us?

288
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:37,494
Officer Takagi mentioned just a while ago, didn't he?

289
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:41,294
That a simple party was held at this shop at 20:00 sharp,

290
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:43,694
and to show him evidence of it.

291
00:14:43,694 --> 00:14:45,094
To show him the piece of evidence

292
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:48,094
that everyone celebrated the first anniversary of this shop.

293
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:50,394
First anniversary?

294
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:52,494
The party crackers went off, right?

295
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:54,494
Because the employee was handing them out.

296
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,594
That's why I tried to show him the cracker that I got,

297
00:14:57,594 --> 00:14:59,294
but it wasn't on the counter.

298
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:01,694
Of course you couldn't find it there.

299
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:06,294
Because the employee retrieved it right after the crackers were set off.

300
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:08,394
If you're a customer that set off the cracker,

301
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:11,294
you would know that the crackers were retrieved, wouldn't you?

302
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:14,294
That's why you tried to show the tape or pieces of paper

303
00:15:14,294 --> 00:15:17,994
that were scattered over the floor, right?

304
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:19,394
Yeah.

305
00:15:20,394 --> 00:15:22,494
The three of you who are standing here

306
00:15:22,494 --> 00:15:26,494
didn't set off the crackers at 20:00 sharp with everyone else,

307
00:15:26,494 --> 00:15:28,594
but for some unknown reason, are here,

308
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,094
making you suspicious customers.

309
00:15:32,394 --> 00:15:35,094
These three are the suspects.

310
00:15:35,094 --> 00:15:37,894
All the customers are free to go

311
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:40,094
after getting their names and addresses.

312
00:15:40,094 --> 00:15:41,194
Yeah.

313
00:15:41,194 --> 00:15:45,194
Then, get the names and addresses of the people who are bent over.

314
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,494
Yes, sir!

315
00:15:46,494 --> 00:15:47,894
As for the three of you,

316
00:15:47,894 --> 00:15:50,594
please wait at the table as you are.

317
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:54,994
By the way, was the weapon that Mr. Kunimatsu was hit with, found?

318
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:56,294
Yeah.

319
00:15:56,294 --> 00:15:59,694
It's the mop that was found in the tool closet in the men's room.

320
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:01,994
So, I think that it wasn't a planned act,

321
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:05,794
but rather, an impulsive one.

322
00:16:05,794 --> 00:16:08,094
May I ask a question?

323
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:11,194
Didn't Mr. Kunimatsu have a lucky charm on him?

324
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:14,194
I'm sure he had it in his wallet.

325
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:17,094
Yeah. There was one, a lucky charm.

326
00:16:17,094 --> 00:16:18,094
Really?

327
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:20,294
That's Kazuha's lucky charm,

328
00:16:20,294 --> 00:16:22,394
so could you give it back to her?

329
00:16:22,394 --> 00:16:24,794
No. Since it's evidence,

330
00:16:24,794 --> 00:16:27,794
we'll have to check it thoroughly first.

331
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:28,994
If they check it,

332
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:31,694
they'll find the Heiji's picture inside.

333
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:33,794
No! Don't check it!

334
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:36,294
Hey! Enough already!

335
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:38,094
Mr. Kunimatsu is in the hospital right now

336
00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:41,594
after being beaten and is in a life or death situation.

337
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:44,494
Who cares about the lucky charm at a time like this?

338
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:47,994
I guess so.

339
00:16:47,994 --> 00:16:52,094
Talking of lucky charms... There's something strange.

340
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,994
The wallet that the lucky charm was inside

341
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:59,194
was found in the right back pocket of the jeans the victim was wearing

342
00:16:59,194 --> 00:17:02,894
but his cell phone and cigarettes were also inside the same pocket

343
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:06,094
that was bloated to the fullest.

344
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:07,494
I was wondering

345
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:10,994
if anyone would put so many things like that in one pocket.

346
00:17:10,994 --> 00:17:13,494
Maybe it's because his left hand was in a cast?

347
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:15,994
Since Mr. Kunimatsu broke the wrist of his left hand,

348
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:19,094
he could probably only use his right hand.

349
00:17:19,094 --> 00:17:24,094
I see. That's why he could use only the pocket to the right.

350
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:28,694
But the right pocket of his top was empty.

351
00:17:28,694 --> 00:17:31,494
Are you sure about Mr. Kunimatsu having gone

352
00:17:31,494 --> 00:17:34,194
to watch a tournament this afternoon?

353
00:17:34,194 --> 00:17:37,494
Yeah, because the night before, while going through the internet,

354
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:40,994
remarked, "I've decided on this tournament".

355
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:43,994
Then,

356
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:45,494
we may find out whether it's was so or not

357
00:17:45,494 --> 00:17:47,694
if we ask those three.

358
00:17:48,894 --> 00:17:51,294
If it wasn't a planned crime,

359
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:52,694
the culprit would've had to most likely

360
00:17:52,694 --> 00:17:55,394
start holding a grudge against Mr. Kunimatsu today.

361
00:17:55,394 --> 00:17:57,694
It's most likely that something happened

362
00:17:57,694 --> 00:18:00,894
at the tournament that Mr. Kunimatsu was watching.

363
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:04,494
Besides, after watching the tournament,

364
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:07,894
an excited Mr. Kunimatsu called you, didn't he?

365
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:09,294
Yeah.

366
00:18:09,294 --> 00:18:11,994
He said, "This is just great! Luck has come my way at last!

367
00:18:11,994 --> 00:18:14,594
I'll show you proof from now.".

368
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,394
So, you were waiting for him at this sports cafe.

369
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:20,994
Yes, Kunimatsu told me to come here at around 20:00.

370
00:18:20,994 --> 00:18:22,294
In other words,

371
00:18:22,294 --> 00:18:26,094
the one who beat Mr. Kunimatsu up, likewise,

372
00:18:26,094 --> 00:18:30,694
probably watched a very interesting tournament.

373
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,994
So, please give me your name

374
00:18:33,994 --> 00:18:38,394
and why you weren't at your seat at around 20:00.

375
00:18:38,394 --> 00:18:42,794
Then, let's start with you with the glasses on.

376
00:18:43,794 --> 00:18:46,794
Yes. My name is Kazuo Satsuma.

377
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:50,594
"Kazuo Satsuma (51)" -I got to this shop a little after 20:00,

378
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:54,194
and didn't know they were celebrating its first anniversary.

379
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:57,994
-Really? -I'm not lying.

380
00:18:57,994 --> 00:18:59,094
When I came into the shop,

381
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:01,794
the customers were clapping and excitedly making noise

382
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:04,594
that I figured something must be going on.

383
00:19:04,594 --> 00:19:06,994
Since you came here,

384
00:19:06,994 --> 00:19:08,494
I guess you like sports?

385
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:09,894
Yeah.

386
00:19:09,894 --> 00:19:12,394
I like Sumo wrestling, so I went to watch today too.

387
00:19:15,694 --> 00:19:17,994
See, that match!

388
00:19:17,994 --> 00:19:20,594
Well, it was a good match,

389
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:23,594
but I'm a fan of Akashoryu, who lost,

390
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:25,694
so I was vexed.

391
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:29,594
So, you saw Mr. Kunimatsu who looked delighted watching the match

392
00:19:29,594 --> 00:19:31,294
and held a grudge against him?

393
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:33,594
No, I didn't.

394
00:19:33,594 --> 00:19:36,894
Did Mr. Kunimatsu like Sumo wrestling?

395
00:19:36,894 --> 00:19:38,294
Beats me.

396
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:39,594
There was a time when he was watching

397
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,794
a live Sumo wrestling broadcast though.

398
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:43,994
I'm Kengo Haruto.

399
00:19:43,994 --> 00:19:47,094
"Kengo Haruto (44)" -I got a call just before 20:00.

400
00:19:47,094 --> 00:19:50,594
I figured it was going to get noisy with the crackers going off and all,

401
00:19:50,594 --> 00:19:53,094
so I stepped outside the shop a bit.

402
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:55,694
Who was the call from?

403
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,394
I don't know!

404
00:19:57,394 --> 00:19:58,594
It was a solicitor or something,

405
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:00,994
who went on explaining that I got pissed,

406
00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:02,694
shouted and hung up!

407
00:20:03,694 --> 00:20:05,294
And when I came back inside,

408
00:20:05,294 --> 00:20:08,494
there was this fuss about somebody being beaten.

409
00:20:08,494 --> 00:20:10,794
Since the cash register was out of order too,

410
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:13,994
I was seated at my seat, then the police got here.

411
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:16,594
Is the history of that call still there?

412
00:20:16,594 --> 00:20:19,494
Yeah, because it was an unidentifiable call.

413
00:20:19,494 --> 00:20:23,994
And? Did you go to watch any match today?

414
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:26,494
-Yeah, I did. -What match?

415
00:20:26,494 --> 00:20:29,294
Beach volleyball!

416
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,694
It was a succession of close games and sure was a lot of fun!

417
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:35,794
Well, I did have my expectations of wardrobe malfunction too!

418
00:20:35,794 --> 00:20:38,194
So you who were watching the players with a lewd look

419
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:41,394
got into a fight with Mr. Kunimatsu?

420
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:43,894
I didn't get into a fight!

421
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:46,494
Did Mr. Kunimatsu like beach volleyball?

422
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:49,394
Yeah, he likes it pretty much.

423
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:52,494
Then, finally, you are?

424
00:20:52,494 --> 00:20:55,194
I'm Takuya Kyuma.

425
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:57,894
"Takuya Kyuma (26)" -I wasn't at my seat around 20:00

426
00:20:57,894 --> 00:20:59,694
because I ran out of cigarettes

427
00:20:59,694 --> 00:21:01,494
and since the vending machine in the shop

428
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,594
didn't have the brand that I always smoke,

429
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:06,194
I went out to buy it.

430
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:08,594
And, when you came back after buying your cigarette,

431
00:21:08,594 --> 00:21:11,494
there was a fuss, and the police were here?

432
00:21:11,494 --> 00:21:12,794
Yes.

433
00:21:12,794 --> 00:21:15,794
And? Did you watch any matches today?

434
00:21:15,794 --> 00:21:18,394
Yeah, I did.

435
00:21:18,394 --> 00:21:22,394
I watched the Tokyo Spirits vs. Big Osaka at the Tohto Stadium.

436
00:21:23,494 --> 00:21:25,494
You were watching a soccer game.

437
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:30,494
Yeah, it was 1-2, an exciting game to the end.

438
00:21:30,494 --> 00:21:34,594
Well, since I'm a fan of the visitor team Big Osaka,

439
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:37,694
I clapped inconspicuously cheering the teammates of Big Osaka

440
00:21:37,694 --> 00:21:41,094
who were hugging each other on the grounds after winning the game.

441
00:21:42,494 --> 00:21:45,294
If Mr. Kunimatsu were watching that match

442
00:21:45,294 --> 00:21:46,794
and got emotionally carried away,

443
00:21:46,794 --> 00:21:49,794
he would've had to be cheering for the same Big Osaka team.

444
00:21:49,794 --> 00:21:53,594
There seems to have been nothing to cause a grudge here.

445
00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:56,194
Did Mr. Kunimatsu watch soccer?

446
00:21:56,194 --> 00:21:58,394
He used to watch it a lot on TV,

447
00:21:58,394 --> 00:22:00,894
but he didn't have any particular team that he favored.

448
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:06,294
I see.

449
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:09,494
What? It seems like you've come to something too.

450
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,494
Yeah.

451
00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:15,694
The assault and battery case that occurred at the sports club.

452
00:22:15,694 --> 00:22:19,094
While the first anniversary of the shop was in progress,

453
00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:22,394
someone beat Mr. Kunimatsu up in the toilet compartment.

454
00:22:23,494 --> 00:22:25,594
The suspects are the three who are in the shop

455
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,394
despite not having set off the crackers.

456
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:32,694
The answer leading to the real culprit is hidden in their testimonies!

457
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:55,694
"Next episode" -What's with you,

458
00:23:55,694 --> 00:23:57,094
all hung up on a lucky charm all the while?

459
00:23:57,094 --> 00:24:00,094
That's a lucky charm that's effective only for me!

460
00:24:00,094 --> 00:24:01,094
You don't have proof

461
00:24:01,094 --> 00:24:03,194
and yet you still intend to keep us here?

462
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:07,094
If you want to go home that badly, just go.

463
00:24:07,094 --> 00:24:11,294
Of course. I'm talking about the two who aren't the culprit, though.

464
00:24:11,294 --> 00:24:15,894
That culprit said something strange

465
00:24:15,894 --> 00:24:18,594
that even a kid like me saw through.
