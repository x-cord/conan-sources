1
00:00:00,289 --> 00:00:02,989
"Kuwanoki High School."

2
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:10,089
Oh?

3
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:12,789
Eimi?

4
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:18,789
I'm sorry. Wrong person.

5
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,288
She practices fencing.

6
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:26,788
Oh, how cool.

7
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,688
I wonder which way.

8
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:31,588
Maybe it's faster we ask?

9
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:36,188
They'll find out that we snuck in here if we do, stupid.

10
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:37,488
Hey, hey.

11
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:39,988
Sonoko, I don't think we should be doing this.

12
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,488
Yep, bummers. I'm going to be late.

13
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:45,389
Sonoko!

14
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:50,189
"Eimi Chikada (17), Kuwanoki High School Third Year Student."

15
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,589
Eimi?

16
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,989
"Weavers' Club" -Over here!

17
00:01:14,089 --> 00:01:16,189
Are you all right, Eimi?

18
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:19,888
Her hair... How cruel!

19
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:22,088
Who did this to you?

20
00:01:22,089 --> 00:01:23,688
I was suddenly attacked from behind.

21
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,189
I didn't see the face.

22
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:33,789
You won't get away with this!

23
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,389
Watch out both of you!

24
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:43,989
We couldn't find the perp after all.

25
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:49,588
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

26
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:52,088
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

27
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:55,588
A love consultation club receives letters of upcoming crimes.

28
00:01:55,589 --> 00:01:57,188
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:58,988
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:01,189
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:46,277
"Welcome to the Weaver's Club."

32
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:50,288
The incident had already occurred three days ago and yesterday...

33
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:52,388
"Three Days Ago."

34
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:54,489
"Megumi Godai (16), Kuwanoki High School Second Year Student."

35
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:58,089
"Yesterday."

36
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:01,188
"Chie Tamai (18)" -Furthermore, there was.

37
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:02,788
"Kuwanoki High School Third Year Student" -a warning before it happened.

38
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:05,588
"July 8, MG will suffer my wrath!"

39
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:07,788
The date was when the incident occurred.

40
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,088
"July 10, CT will face retribution!"

41
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:12,488
The alphabets were the initials of the victims.

42
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,488
The letter was delivered to the Weavers' Club.

43
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:20,188
A love advice club at the school that Eimi had opened

44
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:23,288
with a few of her classmates.

45
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,488
They took after the Juliet Club that actually existed in Italy.

46
00:04:26,489 --> 00:04:28,388
In this day and age instead of using text mail,

47
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,388
the fact that they accepted giving advice only through postal mail

48
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:35,389
seem to have made it popular among the girl students.

49
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,289
And this morning, again...

50
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:41,989
"July 11, EC will be brought to justice!"

51
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,688
The date was today.

52
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:47,988
Initials "EC". Eimi Chikada, thinking it referred to her,

53
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:50,088
came to ask advice from Sonoko,

54
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,689
who she had befriended where she part-timed.

55
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:56,388
No way!

56
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:58,988
Hot red pepper and toy spiders maybe,

57
00:04:58,989 --> 00:05:00,888
-but to cut the hair of a girl -This should do it.

58
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:03,788
-is definitely a crime! An assault! -Thanks so much.

59
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:05,888
Yeah, true.

60
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,688
Then, let's report it to the police right away.

61
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:09,288
-Wait! -Please wait.

62
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:12,188
I'll take care of this case... What?

63
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:16,088
I'm sorry. I just remembered this.

64
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:18,088
Don't tell me it's from the perp.

65
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:19,189
Show it to me!

66
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,888
"Today at sundown, TB will die!"

67
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,188
What?

68
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:27,388
At sundown?

69
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:30,088
In about two hours.

70
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:32,788
What now, Sonoko?

71
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:35,088
We can't be waiting for the police.

72
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,888
I'll nab the perp

73
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:40,289
and save this person with initials "TB"!

74
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:45,088
What's wrong, Conan?

75
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:47,488
No, it's nothing.

76
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:51,488
So, off we go!

77
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:54,988
Now that the case had escalated to demanding a time limit,

78
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:58,588
it could no longer be considered a mere prank.

79
00:05:58,589 --> 00:05:59,589
However, we could not get a hold

80
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,188
of the personal list of the students due to privacy issues,

81
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:05,089
So we decided to go around asking the students directly.

82
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:08,588
If the "T" of "TB", stands for the first name of a person,

83
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:13,988
there are quite a few, such as Tae, Takako, Tamami, and Toshiko.

84
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:16,688
If "B" stands for the surname, there shouldn't be all that many.

85
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:17,689
In fact,

86
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,588
we were immediately able to find the names Baba, Bando and Bito,

87
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,288
but none of them could think of being a target,

88
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:26,989
nor did they know about the Weavers' Club.

89
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,888
Oh, no!

90
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,889
We have less than one hour to go before sundown.

91
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:36,688
Eimi.

92
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:39,188
Sonoko, don't you think it's better

93
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:41,588
we contact the police even from now?

94
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:43,888
If something happens, it could be a disaster.

95
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:46,488
That's true, but...

96
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,889
Okay!

97
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:52,988
Let me start over from scratch.

98
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:55,588
Something bothered me here.

99
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:56,889
That's...

100
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:04,189
Right. One of it was the hair that was stuck to the window sill.

101
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:09,789
Maybe?

102
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:13,788
I found it!

103
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:16,488
Just as I thought.

104
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:18,188
The other is...

105
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:19,489
that.

106
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:29,688
I found it.

107
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:32,789
"Chie Tamai, Megumi Godai" -It's the first and second victims.

108
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:36,689
This is...

109
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,788
"Dear Romeo."

110
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:40,588
Hey! Just what're you doing, kid?

111
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:41,989
Oh, no!

112
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:47,888
No, Conan.

113
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:49,988
You shouldn't read the letters of other people.

114
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:54,788
I'm sorry. I wanted to help too.

115
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:58,089
Eimi, who's Romeo?

116
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:12,689
"Yuto Kariya (17), Kuwanoki High School Third Year Student."

117
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:18,488
Oh, Romeo.

118
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:21,389
Why oh why art thou, Romeo?

119
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:27,688
Oh, my God. He ignored me.

120
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:28,788
Just as expected of

121
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:32,688
the most handsome valedictorian of the school, Yuto Kariya!

122
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:33,788
I've seen loads of letters

123
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:38,188
written by girls' love sick over you delivered to you.

124
00:08:38,189 --> 00:08:40,889
That's only natural for you, isn't it?

125
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,089
-What? -Where were you an hour ago?

126
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:52,989
You cut her hair in the Weavers' Club room, right?

127
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:59,288
Just what on earth are you talking about?

128
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,589
One hour ago, I was...

129
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:03,489
"I found your cutter knife."

130
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,488
"Meet me behind the gym so I can return it to you."

131
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:11,288
It's the same handwriting as the other letters.

132
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,488
Did you go?

133
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:15,188
It's true that I lost my cutter knife.

134
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,288
It was too much trouble to buy another one, so...

135
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:18,488
And?

136
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:20,688
I waited about five minutes but nobody came

137
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:22,688
so I came back here.

138
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:23,988
That's it.

139
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:25,988
You expect me to believe that?

140
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:27,388
You're acting it all out alone, right?

141
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:28,888
In order to establish an alibi?

142
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:30,588
Think as you wish.

143
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:33,788
I don't need to have you guys believe me.

144
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:37,488
Is that all? I've got no time to be fooling around.

145
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:40,688
You're trying for a state university, right?

146
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:42,888
What? Yeah.

147
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:44,588
That's why you're wasting my time.

148
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:46,888
You're honestly a nuisance.

149
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:50,389
Scram, 'cos you get on my nerves.

150
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:02,690
All set, he's the perp.

151
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:04,390
Really, Sonoko?

152
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:07,390
He really pisses me off. What an attitude!

153
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:09,591
That makes him a perp?

154
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,990
His personality is the pits! He's the perp!

155
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,991
Cool it, Sonoko.

156
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:23,390
You didn't write letters concerning Romeo, Eimi?

157
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:25,190
What?

158
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:29,390
Oh, I see. Because Romeo is what the victims have in common.

159
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:33,990
No, because I'm the one who's asked for advice.

160
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:35,190
Besides...

161
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:38,390
You'd never fall for a guy like him, would you?

162
00:10:38,391 --> 00:10:39,890
Oh, no. We don't have time.

163
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:44,890
We've got to go find proof that he's the perp.

164
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:46,890
I was never even worth noticing.

165
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:50,690
Hey, Sonoko. Weren't we going to look for "TB"?

166
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,990
Since we can't find "TB"...

167
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:55,990
Rather, it's faster to nab the perp, right?

168
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:57,690
I guess so.

169
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,390
I was thinking,

170
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:04,391
I wonder if "TB" is really the initials of a victim.

171
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:07,790
What?

172
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,490
What do you mean, Conan?

173
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:12,190
Well, the Weaver's Club

174
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:16,490
took after the Juliet Club of Italy, right?

175
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:18,890
Yes, that's correct.

176
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:21,790
Maybe the alphabet in the letters also symbolizes

177
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:26,590
the characters that appear in Romeo and Juliet?

178
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,990
The "MG" in the first letter,

179
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:32,490
stand for the M and G in Romeo's family name Montague.

180
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,190
The second "CT" stand for

181
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:38,691
the C and T taken from Juliet's family name Capulet. If so then...

182
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:43,090
You really know the details, don't you? Precocious brat.

183
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:46,490
That's because I checked on it a bit.

184
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:47,691
See?

185
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:51,791
It's surprising you noticed, Conan.

186
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:57,990
Both families didn't allow the love between Romeo and Juliet.

187
00:11:57,991 --> 00:12:02,090
Their only concern was their family's reputation.

188
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:03,690
I see!

189
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:04,891
That's why...

190
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:08,890
Rage and atonement.

191
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:10,890
Right.

192
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:13,090
Which means the "EC" in the third letter

193
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:15,690
does not only refer to Eimi?

194
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:18,890
EC...

195
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:22,891
I wonder if there was such a character in Romeo and Juliet?

196
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:29,190
Maybe it's the E and C that stand for Prince Escalus?

197
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:33,890
He exiled Romeo who was accused for homicide from the domain

198
00:12:33,891 --> 00:12:36,490
is what's written here.

199
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:39,190
That's why he needs to be punished.

200
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,290
I remember.

201
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:45,190
I think it was that a friend is stabbed

202
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:47,090
because of the brawls between the two families,

203
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:49,890
and Romeo avenges his friend's death.

204
00:12:49,891 --> 00:12:53,290
That friend's name I think was...

205
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,890
Mercutio.

206
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:57,990
Right! And the one who killed him was...

207
00:12:57,991 --> 00:12:59,290
-Tybalt! -Tybalt!

208
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,491
Right, "TB"!

209
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:04,690
In other words,

210
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:09,990
"TB will die" means Romeo will kill Tybalt!

211
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:12,090
So, it's him after all.

212
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,690
He's the perp!

213
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:18,290
Wait, Sonoko! Then, who is "TB"?

214
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,791
That's...

215
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,990
We'll find out if we ask him!

216
00:13:23,991 --> 00:13:26,191
Wait, Sonoko!

217
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,390
The restroom, maybe.

218
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:39,891
Hey!

219
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:49,290
He was called by the course advisor?

220
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:54,391
Yep, he wasn't called directly, but was texted.

221
00:14:04,591 --> 00:14:07,290
Maybe that's...

222
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,590
Right! The same as the memo we saw a while ago.

223
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:11,590
He's establishing an alibi!

224
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:14,190
Where's Eimi?

225
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:17,390
Gee, where could she have gone at a time like this?

226
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:20,391
After we figured out who the perp is.

227
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:24,090
Conan's gone too.

228
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:26,191
That brat too?

229
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:35,490
Hey, Sonoko. How did Romeo kill Tybalt?

230
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:37,391
How...

231
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:44,291
Yeah, like that. Like when fencing, sword against sword.

232
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:46,990
What?

233
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:48,290
I almost forgot.

234
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,790
Eimi was selected for her talent at fencing

235
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,790
and in the school festival stage performance of Romeo and Juliet last year,

236
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,490
acted the role of Tybalt.

237
00:14:57,491 --> 00:15:01,190
Which means she's "TB"?

238
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,990
Oh, no. Eimi will be killed by Romeo!

239
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:05,691
We've got to hurry and find her!

240
00:15:06,691 --> 00:15:10,691
Eimi!

241
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,690
Did you find her?

242
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,490
Nope.

243
00:15:26,491 --> 00:15:27,990
What?

244
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:29,191
Sonoko!

245
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:31,891
Eimi?

246
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:54,291
-Don't! -Run, Eimi!

247
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,591
No way.

248
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:04,390
What's going on, anyway?

249
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:05,990
Don't tell me...

250
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:08,691
Don't tell me that you deceived us, Eimi?

251
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:12,290
Deceived?

252
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,891
Did you use us?

253
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:19,490
What?

254
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:20,991
I don't get it.

255
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,991
Explain it so I understand, Eimi.

256
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:29,690
It... it's come.

257
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:32,690
It's here.

258
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,090
Sonoko.

259
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:38,490
Then, let me explain it to you.

260
00:16:38,491 --> 00:16:41,490
Eimi, why did we meet today

261
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:44,990
at that given place and time to begin with?

262
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:45,991
What?

263
00:16:45,992 --> 00:16:48,090
That's because...

264
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,790
Eimi told you to.

265
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,790
She also told you to be on time.

266
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,590
Did you forget, Sonoko?

267
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:56,190
I thought so.

268
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:58,190
Sonoko?

269
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:00,790
Oh, that's right.

270
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:05,890
And we saw you, Eimi, being attacked.

271
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:06,990
Was it a coincidence?

272
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:09,190
No, not so.

273
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:13,590
You deliberately showed it to us, who came on time, right?

274
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:16,690
You acted the whole thing out yourself.

275
00:17:16,691 --> 00:17:17,991
What?

276
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:34,590
You stole it from Romeo, rather Yuto Kariya, right?

277
00:17:34,591 --> 00:17:37,290
In order to set him up as the perp?

278
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,190
But if he were the perp,

279
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,990
he wouldn't have left it at the site.

280
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:43,590
That's why, Eimi,

281
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:46,890
you couldn't help but throw it out the window.

282
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:49,990
Well, if you use it later like this,

283
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:52,490
it was like killing two birds with one stone though.

284
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:55,190
Conan found the hole made below the window

285
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:57,991
by the cutter knife in the flower bed.

286
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:01,590
Of course, you're the only one

287
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:04,190
who could've thrown the cutter knife onto the flower bed

288
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:06,890
from where you were back then.

289
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:08,890
And now again,

290
00:18:08,891 --> 00:18:12,990
you texted Yuto Kariya so he wouldn't have an alibi.

291
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,390
And after trying to make it look like he killed you,

292
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:18,890
you were going to commit suicide.

293
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,590
No.

294
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:25,590
You wrote all four letters, didn't you, Eimi?

295
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:27,890
You wanted everyone to think that

296
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:32,890
the incidents were playing out the story of Romeo and Juliet as planned.

297
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:35,790
Then, you wanted to fulfill your true motive of killing yourself

298
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:39,290
by weaving everything together.

299
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,690
Why on earth, Eimi?

300
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:43,290
Yeah.

301
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,990
Why involve me who had nothing to do with this?

302
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,091
Why?

303
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:52,790
You forgot, didn't you?

304
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,390
What?

305
00:18:55,391 --> 00:18:58,891
It was only a month ago and yet...

306
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,490
I conjured up all the courage I had

307
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:06,990
and asked if you would meet me, just the two of us,

308
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:09,990
and you responded.

309
00:19:09,991 --> 00:19:14,090
I waited for a long time at the place you told me to wait.

310
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:20,190
I waited because I promised I would.

311
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,990
But you didn't come.

312
00:19:23,991 --> 00:19:25,790
I figured you came up with something urgent.

313
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,090
Something you couldn't tell anybody about.

314
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:33,591
That's what I believed, until just the other day...

315
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:40,690
I was the one being laughed at.

316
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:43,090
That day, you placed a bet with your friends

317
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:45,390
on whether I would come or not and how long I would wait for you.

318
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:51,690
It took me a while to realize what was going on.

319
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,290
Because...

320
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,791
Because I believed in Romeo.

321
00:19:58,491 --> 00:19:59,891
Unforgivable.

322
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:04,490
What're you talking about?

323
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:06,090
Romeo my foot?

324
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:07,790
Getting all drunk over some fairytale

325
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,291
is so stupid!

326
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:23,491
No, Eimi!

327
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:30,590
You... you don't have to kill yourself

328
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,190
or much less commit a crime for a guy like him.

329
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:35,491
He's not worth it!

330
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:42,190
But you wanted somebody to find out.

331
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:44,690
That's why you came to me.

332
00:20:44,691 --> 00:20:45,890
You wanted me to stop you.

333
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:49,491
Isn't that what you wanted deep down inside, Eimi?

334
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,491
I'm sorry.

335
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,691
I'm sorry.

336
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,590
You'll be fine. Look.

337
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:14,191
Everybody's worried about you.

338
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:17,890
"Did you find TB? Please save them."

339
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:19,890
"I'm worried about TB. I asked around, but nobody knows who it is."

340
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:21,091
"Did you find TB? I'm asking my friends, but we can't find them."

341
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,291
Even the two you got involved texted you.

342
00:21:26,091 --> 00:21:30,091
"We don't want 'TB' to experience something worse than us."

343
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:35,890
And I'm the one who did all this.

344
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:38,790
If you want to go apologize, we'll go with you.

345
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,190
Right, Sonoko?

346
00:21:40,191 --> 00:21:41,690
Yeah, of...

347
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:44,391
Of course, Eimi!

348
00:23:18,991 --> 00:23:20,990
Dad.

349
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:22,590
You ran out of beer and snacks,

350
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:24,190
so you want me to get them for you?

351
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:25,590
How would you like to have

352
00:23:25,591 --> 00:23:28,290
a taste of my swift and skillful deduction solving technique?

353
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:31,690
Well, but I don't remember much of it again.

354
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:33,090
You heard?

355
00:23:33,091 --> 00:23:37,090
Her deductive skills don't even come close to yours?

356
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:41,991
I mean, I'm the one doing the deduction for both of you.

"Next Episode"

358
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,490
I need to think.

359
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:53,190
So, it's check. Shukichi Haneda.

360
00:23:53,191 --> 00:23:56,390
My captured rook will shatter your offense

361
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:58,890
and your tactical formation will totally collapse.

362
00:23:58,891 --> 00:24:00,090
This is...

363
00:24:00,091 --> 00:24:01,991
the lance!

364
00:24:04,891 --> 00:24:05,990
I see.

365
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:07,990
I see the picture now!

366
00:24:07,991 --> 00:24:09,490
