1
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,189
The strings play a murderous tone.

2
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,989
Annoying human relationships.

3
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,789
Harmonic tones echo and the case is solved.

4
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,389
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,189
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,290
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:55,458
We were summoned by Ms. Hasuki Shitara

8
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:58,559
and went to visit Choichiro Shitara's residence. Pops, Ran and I.

9
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:01,058
Hasuki had called us

10
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:02,458
because incomprehensible accidents

11
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,058
revolving around the famed musical instrument Stradivarius

12
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:06,258
have been occurring consecutively from the year before last.

13
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,059
Her request was for us to investigate these accidents.

14
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:11,458
However, as soon as we got there,

15
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,358
the annex went up in flames!

16
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:16,159
Genzaburo who was inside, dies.

17
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,858
Moreover, that night,

18
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:21,858
while Kyosuke was playing the Requiem on his violin,

19
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:25,458
Ayane falls from the 3rd floor to her death.

20
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:28,858
Left behind are a violin and several traces of things.

21
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:30,359
What is going on...

22
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,059
"Cacophony of Stradivarius! Postlude!"

23
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:52,058
That's no doubt the bridge of a violin.

24
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:57,458
But, the bridge was on the replica as well as the Stradivarius.

25
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:58,658
Which means...

26
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:01,359
there was one more violin.

27
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:05,058
And one more thing.

28
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,358
There was something that looked like the tip of a chopstick.

29
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:08,958
And that was...

30
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,558
a tact.

31
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:12,358
The conductor's staff used in an orchestra.

32
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,858
Yeah, we found something that looked to be the burnt remains of a case.

33
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:19,158
Right, shaped something like this,

34
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,758
and maybe two thin sticks would fit into it.

35
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,459
Which means that there was nothing in the case, right?

36
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,559
So that's the story.

37
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:32,959
But, there is one thing I don't understand...

38
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,659
What is the killer so hung up on?

39
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,459
Come to think of it, Mom told me some time in the past...

40
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,358
"Do-Do-Re-Mi-Mi-So."

41
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,058
"Mi-Mi-Re-Re-Do."

42
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:49,958
"Do-Do-Re-Mi-Mi-So."

43
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,958
"Mi-Mi-Re-Re-Do."

44
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,858
"Do-Do-Re-Mi-Mi-So."

45
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,759
"Mi-Mi-Re-Re-Do."

46
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:00,058
Why do I spread my fingers out when I play the piano?

47
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:02,158
Well...

48
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,658
There's this thing called a chord.

49
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,358
For example...

50
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:08,159
This is the "C" chord.

51
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,459
This is "D".

52
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:14,259
This is "E".

53
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:15,259
Okay...

54
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:23,459
Well? Doesn't this chord make you feel sort of uncomfortable?

55
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,658
Inspector, it's suicide, suicide.

56
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:44,258
The entrance door and the door of the storeroom were both locked up.

57
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:45,858
In such a locked room, it's impossible.

58
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:49,458
If Ayane used the chair as a step and jumped out

59
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:51,458
the only thing thinkable is suicide.

60
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:54,358
Then, doesn't it bother you

61
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:57,458
that people with the initials in keeping

62
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:00,758
with the musical scale, D-E-F-G-A have died.

63
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,658
It's true that before the "A" of Ayane

64
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:06,958
comes Genzaburo's "G". But, it's probably just a coincidence.

65
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,158
That room was locked too,

66
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:12,058
and the fire was probably caused by him falling asleep while smoking.

67
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:13,758
But...

68
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,859
At any rate, I think we should call it a day...

69
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:21,959
Dad.

70
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:26,958
What is it, Ran? What?

71
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,658
Well, after yawning and making a funny looking face,

72
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,758
you fall asleep and start your deduction show.

73
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,558
A funny looking face?

74
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:38,558
Right, right, and you also make strange sounds

75
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:39,858
like "hanyah" or whatever.

76
00:05:39,859 --> 00:05:41,758
I thought it sounded more like "Hohee"?

77
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,859
No, I think it was "Henyo" the other day.

78
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:53,159
Right, right, it's this face, this voice!

79
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,758
The Sleeping Kogoro.

80
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,758
He's sure putting on a haughty pose today.

81
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,058
Of course,

82
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:04,958
because after all I solved the mystery that even you, Inspector,

83
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,159
could not solve despite all your thinking.

84
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,559
The truth of what has been happening here at this house from two years ago.

85
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,358
But you kept insisting that it was suicide till just a while ago.

86
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:20,958
Well, it was an instant flash of inspiration.

87
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,558
Please gather the things I ask for here.

88
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:29,058
After everything's ready please call the four suspects here.

89
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:30,258
And of course, please don't forget

90
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,758
that famed musical instrument, the Stradivarius.

91
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,958
Okay, what do we bring for you.

92
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,758
No, Officer Takagi, please wait for us in another room.

93
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,759
Why?

94
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,858
You'll find out later.

95
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,559
Don't come out until I call you, all right?

96
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:53,258
So, you've figured out who the killer is?

97
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:56,458
Which means you think this is a serial murder case?

98
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,958
Are you referring to Great Uncle Genzaburo and Grandmother Ayane too?

99
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:04,958
Yes, they are all victims that have been killed by one person.

100
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,959
It is most likely that Eimi who tripped over the stairs

101
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,658
and Furuto who fell to his death from the veranda

102
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:13,958
were also killed by the same person.

103
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,358
"Hasuki Shitara (23), Choichiro's granddaughter" -Oh no.

104
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:18,458
"Choichiro Shitara (72)" -Why would this Stradivarius

105
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:20,758
have anything to do with solving the mystery?

106
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,958
He's probably figured out who it is was.

107
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,058
"Benio Tsumagari (54), Steward" that switched the violin with a replica

108
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:27,758
then came back here just to return the violin.

109
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,058
No. I thought I'd like you to listen to a song I will play

110
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:33,558
before starting my deduction show.

111
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:34,858
In other words, a prelude to solving the mystery,

112
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:36,659
I guess you could say.

113
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,358
Dad?

114
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:45,258
Yes, just like I did in front of you a while ago.

115
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:46,759
Are you ready?

116
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,158
Well... I don't think you should.

117
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,458
Of course you shouldn't.

118
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:57,258
Just what do you think my Stradivarius is?

119
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:58,358
Just what do you intend to do

120
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:00,658
if an amateur like you handles it and scratches it or something.

121
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:04,158
Well, well, let's see what he wants to do.

122
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:06,758
I'm sure he has something in mind.

123
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,358
Or, is there some reason why you don't want to let him have it,

124
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:11,258
Uncle Choichiro.

125
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:15,059
No, I don't. Here...

126
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,859
I'm all ears...

127
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:27,558
So, it was you after all, wasn't it, Kyosuke?

128
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:29,859
You're the one who switched the violin.

129
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:35,658
Hey, hey, I just handed it over to you

130
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,358
because you said you wanted to play it.

131
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:39,358
If I remember correctly,

132
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:42,958
the people who handled this violin was in the order as follows.

133
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,958
Kyosuke tuned the violin this afternoon

134
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,358
and handed it over to Hasuki.

135
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,858
When she was showing me the violin

136
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:53,559
fire breaks out at the annex.

137
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:58,858
The Stradivarius that was left on the table

138
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:00,959
was taken to the storeroom by Ms. Tsumagari.

139
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,658
If the one who switched the violins were either.

140
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:08,758
Ms. Tsumagari or Choichiro who could go in and out of the storeroom,

141
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:11,558
it would have been switched after I played

142
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,058
the violin in Hasuki's room.

143
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,858
If my fingerprints are found on the violin,

144
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:18,358
either one of the two

145
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:19,859
would've been the one who switched the violin.

146
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,258
If so, that person would've let me touch the Stradivarius one more time

147
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:30,158
in order to make unknown when my fingerprints got on the violin.

148
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,658
If it were Kyosuke or Hasuki that did the switch,

149
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,258
it would be the same.

150
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:37,058
They would want me to touch it here.

151
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:39,958
If my prints are not found on that genuine violin,

152
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:44,358
it would mean that it had been switched to the replica before I played it,

153
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:47,258
and both of you would be suspected.

154
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:49,158
However, Hasuki and...

155
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,858
Choichiro, as well as Ms. Tsumagari

156
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:55,458
objected to my touching the Stradivarius.

157
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:57,558
But, you urged me to go ahead.

158
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,458
In other words, Kyosuke...

159
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,958
this is evidence that you are

160
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:04,559
the one who had committed the serial murders.

161
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,558
Great Uncle... Oh, no...

162
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:11,458
But, it could be that when Kyosuke was tuning the violin,

163
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,658
it was already the replica.

164
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:15,158
That's not possible.

165
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:18,159
With an ear like his...

166
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,858
He would know right off the bat that it's not genuine.

167
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:27,858
Well... But what makes you say he's the murderer?

168
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:30,358
Ayane's room was locked, and besides...

169
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:34,458
Genzaburo's room that caught fire was also locked.

170
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,959
Hey, kid, show them the stuff.

171
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,658
Okay! Here it is...

172
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:42,759
It's the metal piece that was found in Genzaburo's room.

173
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:49,958
Take a good look, Inspector,

174
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:52,858
only the hole on the top part is bent.

175
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:55,558
If the locked door was destroyed and forced open,

176
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,359
the top and bottom should be bent out of shape.

177
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,859
True.

178
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:08,058
When he found that the firefighter was saying,

179
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:10,258
that the bolt sticking out of the door,

180
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:12,358
the top part is the knob and the bottom part is the lock.

181
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:15,458
So from the looks of the direction in which the door was opened,

182
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:18,558
it doesn't seem to have been locked when it was broken down.

183
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,258
But, when we went back to the burnt remains later

184
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:24,658
the door key was locked.

185
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:27,659
Kyosuke locked it.

186
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,158
Back then he pretended that the door was locked

187
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,658
and broke it down.

188
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,759
No good, it's locked!

189
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,459
When we were all distracted by the sea of flames...

190
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:46,058
I see.

191
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:50,058
But what has that to do with switching the violin?

192
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:54,758
He used it to make Ayane jump to her death from this room.

193
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,258
What do you mean?

194
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:59,158
But he was in the room downstairs at that time, wasn't he?

195
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,458
It was also a trap

196
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:04,658
to lure Ayane to the window.

197
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,658
Try to imagine...

198
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,158
The Stradivarius that she used to stare at every night

199
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,958
as if it were her son is switched for a replica.

200
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:14,158
Outraged, she destroys the violin.

201
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:16,558
Can you imagine how she felt.

202
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,958
She then turns to look towards the window

203
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,559
and listens to the beautiful melody played by Kyosuke.

204
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,258
Hey, kid, show them the other stuff next!

205
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:28,259
Yes, sir!

206
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,858
Mr. Mouri, this is...

207
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,658
What is the meaning of this?

208
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:51,359
This is what Ayane saw back then.

209
00:12:57,415 --> 00:13:01,714
Don't tell me that Ayane thought that was the real Stradivarius.

210
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:07,314
Yeah, more so, if the Requiem played by Kyosuke

211
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:11,215
from the floor below sounds like the genuine Stradivarius.

212
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:21,814
She used the chair as a stepping stool and climbed up the window,

213
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:23,915
trying to take the violin...

214
00:13:26,815 --> 00:13:30,014
But, I wonder if she'd fall down so easily.

215
00:13:30,015 --> 00:13:32,314
Let me show you how it was done.

216
00:13:32,315 --> 00:13:34,514
Hey, kid, go get Officer Takagi.

217
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:36,214
Okay!

218
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,314
-Then, Ms. Tsumagari... -Yes, sir.

219
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:41,115
you took the real Stradivarius to the storeroom.

220
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:49,714
Did you call me?

221
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:53,514
Officer Takagi, while Pops was explaining the trick to everyone,

222
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:55,514
a Stradivarius happen to be hanging out the window.

223
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:59,114
-What? -Since you're tall, you can reach it, right?

224
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:01,315
Well... I guess so...

225
00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:06,314
I hope there's nothing behind all this?

226
00:14:06,315 --> 00:14:09,814
No, no... but be extremely careful will you,

227
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,215
because it's valued at more than several billions of yen.

228
00:14:13,315 --> 00:14:16,415
But, mind you it's not my fault if I drop it.

229
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:24,014
Hey, hey...

230
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:25,214
Watch out!

231
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:27,214
Be careful, Takagi!

232
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:28,814
It moved.

233
00:14:28,815 --> 00:14:32,215
When I tried to take the violin, it moved away.

234
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:44,814
I see, a pole was attached to the window frame on both sides,

235
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:46,814
then the violin is suspended with a string.

236
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:48,714
Then the more the window is opened,

237
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:51,114
the farther the violin pulls away.

238
00:14:51,115 --> 00:14:52,514
But, Dad...

239
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:54,414
What if it gets stuck like that?

240
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:57,914
There was no violin or pole anywhere at the site.

241
00:14:57,915 --> 00:15:01,014
This is a temporary gimmick that I made

242
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:03,114
by borrowing a long chopstick from the kitchen.

243
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:05,714
If the two sticks that were used to carry out the crime

244
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:09,214
were the conductor's staff that was stolen from Genzaburo's room,

245
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:10,914
they would be very flexible,

246
00:15:10,915 --> 00:15:12,714
so the violin that moves to the edge

247
00:15:12,715 --> 00:15:15,214
will eventually fall from its weight.

248
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:18,614
Therefore, if the other string that is attached to the violin

249
00:15:18,615 --> 00:15:21,414
is stuck on to the window frame of the room below,

250
00:15:21,415 --> 00:15:24,614
after we ran over to Ayane who we were looking down upon,

251
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:27,114
he secretly went to collect the violin.

252
00:15:27,115 --> 00:15:29,914
But, the staff would still...

253
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:32,214
That too...

254
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:35,014
since it was only stuck on using scotch tape,

255
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:36,714
all he had to do was attach a string to it

256
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:39,114
to collect it later.

257
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:41,914
The sound that we heard before Ayane fell,

258
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:45,614
is the sound of that violin bumping into the wall...

259
00:15:45,615 --> 00:15:46,914
As proof of that,

260
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:51,515
a broken staff was found near the corpse.

261
00:15:52,315 --> 00:15:54,114
He set up this gimmick

262
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:58,814
when he came into this room to tune the Stradivarius.

263
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:01,014
This is probably when he switched the genuine one

264
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:02,614
for the replica too.

265
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:05,414
I'm sure that the conductor's staff

266
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:08,614
and violin that he collected are hidden somewhere in the room below.

267
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:11,314
Of course, with Kyosuke's fingerprints all over it.

268
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:14,714
It's hard to believe that he had time to erase his fingerprints

269
00:16:14,715 --> 00:16:17,514
or to take the things to another place back then

270
00:16:17,515 --> 00:16:18,814
since Hasuki, who broke out in tears was there.

271
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:21,114
It can't be... That's all baloney!

272
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:23,414
Uncle Kyosuke can't be the killer,

273
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,114
because he saved Grandmother

274
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:27,015
who couldn't make it out of the fire in time.

275
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:33,614
If so, then why?

276
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:35,414
That's because of the rule of the "musical scale"

277
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:38,415
that even you know of as a musician.

278
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,614
Why do I spread my fingers out when I play the piano?

279
00:16:41,615 --> 00:16:44,315
Because see, when you play notes that are alongside each other...

280
00:16:49,315 --> 00:16:50,814
Cacophony.

281
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:51,914
When notes that are alongside each other are played

282
00:16:51,915 --> 00:16:54,114
it sounds disharmonic...

283
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:55,614
Don't tell me that...

284
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:56,814
Exactly.

285
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,214
I couldn't stand the fact that Genzaburo with initial "G"

286
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:04,015
and Grandmother Ayane with initial "A" die at the same time.

287
00:17:06,215 --> 00:17:10,214
Why you... just what do you take the life of people to be!

288
00:17:10,215 --> 00:17:13,214
I'd like you to say those words to Uncle Choichiro there too.

289
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,714
What?

290
00:17:14,715 --> 00:17:17,114
Thirty years ago, that old man over there who was to blame

291
00:17:17,115 --> 00:17:19,314
for my father getting seriously hurt, and drove my mother to her death

292
00:17:19,315 --> 00:17:21,314
from the heavy load of caring for father.

293
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:22,714
Thirty years ago.

294
00:17:22,715 --> 00:17:25,914
You mean back when that robbery occurred.

295
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:28,514
I had completely forgotten about it until two years ago

296
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:31,814
when I was asked to tune the Stradivarius

297
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:34,814
during that old man's birthday.

298
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:37,014
The sound of the, the feel...

299
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,214
it brought back memories of when I was still a child,

300
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:43,114
of when my father who gave me the violin.

301
00:17:43,115 --> 00:17:45,114
When I confirmed with Aunt Eimi,

302
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:48,114
she told me with a pale face,

303
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:50,514
that 30 years ago,

304
00:17:50,515 --> 00:17:52,514
that old man over there borrowed the Stradivarius from Father,

305
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:56,415
saying that he wanted to make Furuto, his son play it.

306
00:17:57,415 --> 00:17:59,014
The old man who fell in love with the tone,

307
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:01,314
didn't want to return the violin so,

308
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:04,714
he exchanged it for a replica that looked exactly alike.

309
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:07,614
But, father found out right away and they got into an argument.

310
00:18:07,615 --> 00:18:11,115
On top of that, after father fell down the stairs...

311
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:13,815
he was seriously hurt.

312
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,614
That old man had the nerve to leave father who was seriously hurt as is

313
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:28,214
and didn't even call an ambulance.

314
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:30,914
He then told the four who were there the following.

315
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:35,215
Genzaburo, tie Ayane and me up and you guys go on home!

316
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,714
We're going to make it look as if we were attacked by robbers.

317
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:43,114
Don't you want to play this famed musical instrument?

318
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:45,214
If Danjiro dies, this is mine.

319
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:48,315
I'll lend it to you any time you want.

320
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:53,614
Aunt Eimi, who told me everything,

321
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:55,415
was besides herself and left the room...

322
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,814
So you decided to take revenge on the four

323
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,414
who agreed to the scheme back then.

324
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:16,214
When I saw Aunt Eimi trip over the stairs

325
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:18,215
and fall to her death like Father,

326
00:19:19,615 --> 00:19:21,815
I took it to be a sign from God.

327
00:19:27,515 --> 00:19:28,914
Starting from my mother Chiha,

328
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:30,514
my father Danjiro,

329
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:31,814
Aunt Eimi,

330
00:19:31,815 --> 00:19:34,514
they all died in the order of the musical scale.

331
00:19:34,515 --> 00:19:36,514
And if I lined the initials of the ones who would be dying,

332
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:40,514
I figured it would begin with "C" and end with "C".

333
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:44,914
Well, but after pushing Furuto off the veranda a year ago,

334
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:46,614
I was sort of flustered when I found out

335
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:50,014
that the last one on the list with initial "C",

336
00:19:50,015 --> 00:19:51,715
Gramps Choichiro was about to die of an illness.

337
00:19:57,015 --> 00:19:59,714
Then, I, who was not at all aware of what took place 30 years ago,

338
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:02,514
was next in line to be killed after all...

339
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:07,814
No, in Germany after C-D-E-F-G-A

340
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:11,015
comes the alphabet "H", it's pronounced "HA".

341
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:13,815
In other words, it stands for Haga.

342
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:16,915
Uncle!

343
00:20:26,915 --> 00:20:28,414
Pops told me to do so,

344
00:20:28,415 --> 00:20:30,215
so I told them to wait below with a mat.

345
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:35,314
Because he said that Kyosuke may commit suicide.

346
00:20:35,315 --> 00:20:38,614
But, if it was initial "H", it could've been Hasuki.

347
00:20:38,615 --> 00:20:41,614
It could've been her turn next.

348
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,914
Since Kyosuke brought the Stradivarius back to this room

349
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:48,514
I figured it wasn't going to be so.

350
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:52,714
If Ayane didn't break the replica as she did back then,

351
00:20:52,715 --> 00:20:54,614
it would've been likely that no one would've even noticed

352
00:20:54,615 --> 00:20:57,514
that there was a replica of the Stradivarius at all.

353
00:20:57,515 --> 00:21:01,114
The fact that he came to return the genuine one means

354
00:21:01,115 --> 00:21:02,314
that he wanted to leave the famed,

355
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:05,414
legendary gift that his father had given him to its rightful owner,

356
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:08,014
to the one that he had thrown into the same situation

357
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:11,114
as he was thrown into, when they killed his father...

358
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:15,415
That is, Hasuki. He wanted to give it to you.

359
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:53,714
When I asked you about the melody from my cell phone,

360
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:56,215
you answered "Are you talking about me?"

361
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:01,914
Are you talking about me?

362
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:04,714
Can you tell me what the notes are?

363
00:23:04,715 --> 00:23:07,114
H-A-G-A?

364
00:23:07,115 --> 00:23:11,714
If in German would it be pronounced HAGA?

365
00:23:11,715 --> 00:23:15,714
That's right. You've got a good ear too, sonny.

366
00:23:15,715 --> 00:23:18,914
Which means that the notes are Ti-La-So-La?

367
00:23:18,915 --> 00:23:20,114
Hey, Conan...

368
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:23,214
Do you know of any song that begins with Ti-La-So-La?

369
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:27,714
It could be some sad, yet nostalgic type of music...

370
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:30,115
If so, it's probably...

371
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:36,915
this song?

372
00:23:39,115 --> 00:23:40,714
That song...

373
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:42,514
is The Seven Children, right?

374
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:46,314
"Crow little crow, why do you cry?"

375
00:23:46,315 --> 00:23:47,915
Right, Conan?

376
00:23:48,915 --> 00:23:50,415
Conan?

377
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:57,314
"Next Episode."

378
00:23:57,315 --> 00:23:59,014
What's this threatening feeling I sense

379
00:23:59,015 --> 00:24:00,814
after coming all this way to Kagoshima?

380
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,714
Kogoro Mouri can deceive you no longer.

381
00:24:02,715 --> 00:24:06,415
Genuine Satsuma Distilled Spirits is the best.

382
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:10,714
Doesn't something feel sandy?

383
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,415
It's probably the ashes.

384
00:24:15,615 --> 00:24:16,815
What's the matter?

385
00:24:18,815 --> 00:24:19,815
This is...

386
00:24:20,715 --> 00:24:22,114
Next Conan,

387
00:24:22,115 --> 00:24:26,115
"Kogoro Drunk Over Satsuma! (Part 1)"

388
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:44,114
Next Conan's Hint:

389
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,414
"Sticking to old ways of making liquor."

390
00:24:46,415 --> 00:24:47,614
The next episode takes place in Kagoshima!

391
00:24:47,615 --> 00:24:49,214
Pops, drinks, eats and gets drunk.

392
00:24:49,215 --> 00:24:50,915
What are you going there for, Dad?
