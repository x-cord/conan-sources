1
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:15,555
Hello?

2
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:18,154
Agata, how long are you going to make me wait?

3
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:20,054
Wait? What are you talking about?

4
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:21,254
What?

5
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:26,154
You just sent me a message saying you killed Nishiki and Ihaya,

6
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:29,854
and wanted to talk to me at the Kiyomizu butai

7
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:32,354
before the police arrested you.

8
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:35,754
What? I'd never send that.

9
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:37,454
Did you check the sender's address?

10
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:38,855
Hold on.

11
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:45,754
The sender's address is "chestnut@..."

12
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:47,754
Chestnut...

13
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:50,454
Doesn't "kuri" mean chestnut?

14
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:52,854
Isn't that Dekuri's address?

15
00:00:52,855 --> 00:00:54,455
That's right.

16
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:58,954
I'm the one who sent the message.

17
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:00,854
Me, Dekuri.

18
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:02,554
That's impossible!

19
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:04,254
You're dead.

20
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:05,954
That's right.

21
00:01:05,955 --> 00:01:07,654
After your betrayal,

22
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:10,154
in my despair, I threw myself from the Kiyomizu butai

23
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:12,654
and killed myself.

24
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,855
But...

25
00:01:15,955 --> 00:01:18,654
In order to get my revenge,

26
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:22,254
I've returned from the underworld.

27
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:24,454
How could you trick me like that?

28
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:26,555
I'll never forgive you. Never.

29
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:28,854
I'll never forgive you!

30
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,654
No!

31
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:32,655
Your name was actually...

32
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:38,254
Apologize to Dekuri

33
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:39,855
in hell!

34
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:53,854
Why?

35
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:56,655
The butai is approximately 12 meters tall.

36
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:02,654
If you lay out a cushion beforehand,

37
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,655
you won't end up in the underworld,

38
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:09,954
Riki Agata.

39
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:11,354
How did you know I'd be here?

40
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:13,354
Did you crack the code?

41
00:02:13,355 --> 00:02:16,954
Yes. The key is the white cross-shape surrounded

42
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:21,554
by four black squares at the top of the ciphers.

43
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:27,054
These refer to the Kamigyo, Nakagyo, Shimogyo, Sakyo,

44
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:29,054
and Ukyo Wards of Kyoto.

45
00:02:29,055 --> 00:02:30,654
The rest of the characters

46
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:33,154
are parts of location names in Kyoto.

47
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:34,354
Comparing them against the positions

48
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,054
of the characters in the white cross

49
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:40,655
tells you which location name they refer to and how to read them.

50
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:43,654
Using that method,

51
00:02:43,655 --> 00:02:47,155
the beginning of the cipher sent to Nishiki contains...

52
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:50,654
"Kon" from Kamigyo Ward's Kontaka-cho.

53
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:53,454
"Ro" from Nakagyo Ward's Toroyama-cho.

54
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:56,254
"Suji" from Kamigyo Ward's Sujikaibashi-cho.

55
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:58,454
"No" from Ukyo Ward's Adashino.

56
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:01,454
"Hate" from Sakyo Ward's Kamihate-cho.

57
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:04,854
If you string the first mora in each character together,

58
00:03:04,855 --> 00:03:08,254
you get "ko-ro-su-no-ha".

59
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:11,354
In other words, it becomes "I will kill".

60
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:14,954
The backwards character for "saki" that appears occasionally

61
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:17,754
is the "pon" from Nakagyo Ward's Ponto City.

62
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:19,654
If you flip them around, you get "nop",

63
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:21,754
so you read it as just "n".

64
00:03:21,755 --> 00:03:24,954
So the meaning of the first cipher is,

65
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:30,454
"I will kill three, starting with the scriptwriter."

66
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:33,954
If you read the second cipher

67
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:35,754
found on Nishiki's body in the same way,

68
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:40,154
you get "two more to kill, next is the star".

69
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:41,854
The third cipher reads,

70
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:47,655
"one more to kill, then I'll fall from the butai."

71
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:52,054
After making Mayama's death look like a suicide,

72
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:54,654
you probably intended to announce you figured out how to read the code,

73
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:59,754
making it look like the third cipher was Mayama's suicide note,

74
00:03:59,755 --> 00:04:02,654
but because you wrote where you'd commit suicide,

75
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:06,154
we were able to beat you here.

76
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:08,454
It... it's the curse.

77
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:10,154
It's the curse!

78
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:14,954
It's some curse that made me do all of this!

79
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:18,954
Didn't you see the ceiling in Nishiki's room?

80
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:21,554
A human couldn't have done that in less than ten minutes.

81
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:23,954
Electrostatic notes.

82
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:25,654
By using static electricity,

83
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:30,254
they can be stuck to any wall or object without an adhesive.

84
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:35,455
You used the notes Nishiki used to revise the script.

85
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:41,154
You started by staying in that room the day before

86
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,054
and painting the blood spray and footprints on the ceiling,

87
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:45,354
allowing them to dry.

88
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:50,154
You hid them by covering the entire ceiling with electrostatic notes.

89
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:54,855
Naturally, you reserved that smoking room for the next day as well.

90
00:04:55,955 --> 00:05:00,254
You also reserved every other smoking room,

91
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:03,154
and canceled your reservation for the room painted with blood

92
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:06,155
when Nishiki called the hotel...

93
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:12,355
allowing you to force Nishiki to stay in that room.

94
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:15,854
After killing Nishiki,

95
00:05:15,855 --> 00:05:19,854
you ran a rod over the ceiling to remove the notes

96
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:23,054
and scattered Nishiki's script among them

97
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:25,254
in order to conceal your trick.

98
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:28,954
Then you sucked some of Nishiki's blood into a syringe

99
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:31,054
and sprayed it at the center of the blood spray

100
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:33,355
you painted on the ceiling.

101
00:05:34,555 --> 00:05:36,354
What about the tengu, then?

102
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:40,454
What about the giant tengu that suddenly appeared

103
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:42,254
and vanished in my room?

104
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:45,454
You were the only one who was useful

105
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:48,054
when you helped Dekuri with his comics.

106
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:53,254
Surely, you were artistic and dexterous enough to build

107
00:05:53,255 --> 00:05:56,655
a paper mache tengu of about that size.

108
00:05:57,955 --> 00:06:00,854
If you made it using the flash paper magicians use,

109
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:02,554
just being exposed to the flame of a cigarette

110
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:05,454
would make it go up in flames.

111
00:06:05,455 --> 00:06:10,455
The three centimeter cigarette burn left in your room proves it.

112
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:12,954
If you screamed when you noticed the tengu

113
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,454
after lighting a cigarette

114
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:19,054
and waited to throw your ashtray at the tengu

115
00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:21,255
after we arrived and opened the door...

116
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:25,654
then it doesn't make sense for so much of your cigarette to have remained.

117
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:27,454
In other words,

118
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:31,954
you lit your cigarette just before we opened the door,

119
00:06:31,955 --> 00:06:34,654
even though you should have been too surprised

120
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:36,254
by the tengu to do that.

121
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:39,554
Additionally, you painted the footprints

122
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:43,154
on the inuyarai present at Ihaya's murder during the night,

123
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:47,854
and placed a larger inuyarai over it.

124
00:06:47,855 --> 00:06:49,454
After killing him,

125
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:53,354
you removed that inuyarai, revealing the footprints,

126
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:56,254
and placed it over a different inuyarai.

127
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:00,254
Apparently, they found all kinds of stuff under that inuyarai,

128
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:01,754
like the murder weapon

129
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,254
and a raincoat covered in the victim's blood.

130
00:07:05,255 --> 00:07:07,254
You probably wiped your prints from them

131
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:11,254
so you could make it look like Mayama did it, though.

132
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:12,954
What are you talking about?

133
00:07:12,955 --> 00:07:14,154
Weren't you watching?

134
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:17,854
Mayama was trying to climb over this railing!

135
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,854
He must've been possessed by...

136
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:21,654
No.

137
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:25,154
All that's here are these clear electrostatic notes

138
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:28,654
with red footprints painted on them.

139
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:32,954
If you layered notes the same color as the floorboards over them,

140
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:35,754
you could hide the footprints.

141
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,754
Because you attached nylon string to them

142
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:41,154
and removed them one at a time,

143
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:46,055
it looked to Mayama like the bloody footprints were approaching him.

144
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:50,354
Additionally, you used this directional speaker

145
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:53,754
so only Mayama would hear this horrifying voice.

146
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:54,755
I'll never forgive you.

147
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:57,754
It's no wonder he was desperate to get away.

148
00:07:57,755 --> 00:08:00,854
Since you probably planned to retrieve the notes

149
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,654
and speaker during the commotion caused by his suicide,

150
00:08:04,655 --> 00:08:08,254
your fingerprints should be on them.

151
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,854
Darn it!

152
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:11,455
Move, you brats!

153
00:08:17,155 --> 00:08:18,854
Sorry.

154
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:21,254
He asked the Kyoto police to wear their old school uniforms

155
00:08:21,255 --> 00:08:24,054
and pretend to be students on a trip

156
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:28,354
so you wouldn't be on your guard.

157
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:30,154
No way.

158
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:31,355
Gosh.

159
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,455
Gosh!

160
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:37,154
I don't get it, though.

161
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:40,654
Why did you put two bumps on the bodies?

162
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:43,154
It's the Kobutori Jisan folktale.

163
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,154
The bad man incurred the wrath of a tengu

164
00:08:46,155 --> 00:08:50,554
when he copied the good man and was given two bumps.

165
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:55,254
When I saw the bumps Keiko got during filming,

166
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:58,754
I decided to incorporate it into my plan.

167
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:04,554
Was your motive the absence of Dekuri's name in the credits?

168
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:06,254
Yeah.

169
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:09,554
When I told them during the after-party

170
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:13,954
that Dekuri sat stunned in the theater, they said,

171
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:16,554
"Really? He was that surprised?"

172
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:19,554
"We did it. Well done, everyone."

173
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:23,354
But wasn't it a mistake?

174
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,854
I thought so, too,

175
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,354
but was perplexed after I checked with the staff.

176
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:31,054
They said they fixed the credits,

177
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:33,254
but instead of removing someone's name,

178
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:36,354
they just adjusted the spacing of some characters.

179
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:41,254
They never intended to include Dekuri's name!

180
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:43,054
They only invited Dekuri to the screening

181
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:44,654
so they could laugh at him!

182
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:47,454
You're wrong, Agata!

183
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:50,654
They had to fix the spacing of the characters!

184
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:52,254
It's too late for that.

185
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:53,854
Agata.

186
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:57,855
These are the credits that were supposed to appear after the movie.

187
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:02,254
We had all five of our names displayed at once,

188
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:05,354
changed our names,

189
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,154
and unevenly spaced our names

190
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:13,855
so the name "Michio Dekuri" would appear with ours.

191
00:10:16,655 --> 00:10:19,354
No...

192
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:23,354
We wanted his name to appear as the author of the original work,

193
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:27,354
but our producers said they couldn't pay another staff member,

194
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:29,254
so we did this instead.

195
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:31,054
Since he loved ciphers so much,

196
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:34,154
we thought he'd notice.

197
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:38,254
We did the same thing in our graduation project.

198
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:41,454
We wanted to express our gratitude to him.

199
00:10:41,455 --> 00:10:44,054
We didn't tell you since you and Dekuri were friends.

200
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:47,254
We wanted you to be surprised together.

201
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:49,554
We're sorry.

202
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:53,155
What have I done?

203
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:04,554
Kiyomizu Temple trembled with the remorseful wail of the killer,

204
00:11:04,555 --> 00:11:08,554
as though the red leaves surrounding it

205
00:11:08,555 --> 00:11:11,255
had gone up in flames and withered.

206
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:17,354
They're late.

207
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:18,954
Yeah.

208
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:20,254
Oh, they're here.

209
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:21,855
Shinichi!

210
00:11:23,555 --> 00:11:25,354
Sorry I'm late.

211
00:11:25,355 --> 00:11:28,254
-Did you catch the culprit? -Yeah.

212
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:30,954
But you don't need to worry about it.

213
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:32,154
What's your problem?

214
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:36,354
We changed our plans so we could meet up with you.

215
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:38,754
It was an unpleasant case.

216
00:11:38,755 --> 00:11:40,754
Anyway, we still have some time.

217
00:11:40,755 --> 00:11:42,454
Should we go somewhere?

218
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:44,254
Let's go to Kitano Tenmangu.

219
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,654
Okita mentioned it before.

220
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:48,655
Nice. Let's go.

221
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:52,154
It's pretty far away.

222
00:11:52,155 --> 00:11:53,654
How do we get there?

223
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:56,354
Hey.

224
00:11:56,355 --> 00:11:58,054
How do you feel?

225
00:11:58,055 --> 00:11:59,154
About what?

226
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:00,854
About me.

227
00:12:00,855 --> 00:12:04,055
I heard you met with Okita yesterday.

228
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:10,355
You haven't forgotten that I confessed my feelings to you in London...

229
00:12:25,115 --> 00:12:28,514
I heard you met with Okita yesterday.

230
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:32,015
You haven't forgotten that I confessed my feelings to you in London...

231
00:12:44,615 --> 00:12:46,515
That's my answer.

232
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:51,814
Is that not good enough?

233
00:12:51,815 --> 00:12:53,215
You...

234
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:56,615
You can't do that.

235
00:13:00,215 --> 00:13:01,715
Not on the cheek.

236
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:19,815
Be still, my heart.

237
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:24,115
Listen to me, just this once.

238
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:31,114
Wait, which is this?

239
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:33,215
Which heartbeat is this?

240
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:38,114
Gosh! I knew it was this one!

241
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:39,814
Shinichi?

242
00:13:39,815 --> 00:13:45,014
Sorry, Ran. A case is calling me.

243
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:47,014
I'll see you later.

244
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:48,515
Shinichi!

245
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:54,714
Seriously? He even had you waiting for a kiss.

246
00:13:54,715 --> 00:13:56,314
You were watching?

247
00:13:56,315 --> 00:13:57,614
Well, yeah.

248
00:13:57,615 --> 00:13:59,615
What did he say?

249
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:04,515
He said he got a call from a case.

250
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:08,814
But he didn't look well.

251
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,115
What?

252
00:14:12,715 --> 00:14:13,915
Sera.

253
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:18,514
What? A high school student who had a hard time walking?

254
00:14:18,515 --> 00:14:22,114
Yeah, a male high school student who looks like this.

255
00:14:22,115 --> 00:14:25,114
Did he pass through the Todoroki-mon?

256
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,714
I'm not sure.

257
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:29,914
I don't look at every student who comes through here.

258
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:31,914
I see.

259
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:36,414
If you're looking for Kudo, he just went running that way.

260
00:14:36,415 --> 00:14:39,014
Maybe he went to the bathroom.

261
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:41,615
Really? The bathroom?

262
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,914
By the way, what's with the backpack?

263
00:14:45,915 --> 00:14:48,214
Why wouldn't I have a backpack?

264
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:50,014
It looks pretty heavy.

265
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,214
Can I check what's inside?

266
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:54,414
You idiot! I'm not showing you!

267
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:57,614
I've got underwear and other stuff you shouldn't see in there!

268
00:14:57,615 --> 00:14:59,714
Like porn magazines?

269
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:03,215
Yeah, really filthy hardcore stuff.

270
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:08,114
Huh? There's a Teitan uniform poking out of your bag.

271
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,514
What?

272
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:12,015
Just kidding.

273
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:16,014
Hey, Kudo.

274
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,714
Are you sure that snaggle-toothed girl

275
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:20,414
doesn't know your true identity?

276
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:22,615
Yeah, it's not good.

277
00:15:26,215 --> 00:15:27,515
What?

278
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:30,914
What is it?

279
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:33,014
Sorry, it's nothing.

280
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,515
Bye.

281
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:40,214
I'm so surprised.

282
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:43,015
She's a girl after all.

283
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:50,214
We just received word that Shinichi Kudo of class 2-B

284
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:55,614
can't continue on the school trip due to urgent business.

285
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:56,914
What?

286
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:02,714
Also, he'd prefer to keep his involvement in the case secret,

287
00:16:02,715 --> 00:16:05,314
so he asks that you not mention it on social media!

288
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:08,014
Okay...

289
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:12,514
I was going to ask him about the case on the way back.

290
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:15,114
I guess we can ask Sera.

291
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:18,314
I can't believe that wannabe detective actually left.

292
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:20,814
He never gave you a kiss.

293
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:23,414
Don't say that!

294
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:27,815
Also, Shinichi knew that I met with Okita.

295
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:32,815
I sent Shinichi a picture of your clandestine meeting.

296
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:38,814
So, what were you two talking about?

297
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:40,915
We were talking after I delivered something to him.

298
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:45,614
Detective Sato gave me this good luck charm.

299
00:16:45,615 --> 00:16:48,615
She said you dropped it during the kendo tournament.

300
00:16:49,615 --> 00:16:52,914
I've been looking for this. Thanks.

301
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:55,114
Anyway, so...

302
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:59,414
I left that charm on the desk at the detective agency,

303
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:01,814
and my dad...

304
00:17:01,815 --> 00:17:04,114
What's this good luck charm?

305
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:05,915
Is it Ran's?

306
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:09,314
There's something inside.

307
00:17:09,315 --> 00:17:13,015
It's probably a picture of that detective kid or...

308
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:17,014
Dad, what are you looking at?

309
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:18,714
You looked at the picture?

310
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:21,414
Yes, I wasn't thinking.

311
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,114
Anyway...

312
00:17:24,115 --> 00:17:29,614
Is that girl in the photo your girlfriend?

313
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,615
What?

314
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,514
I got curious,

315
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:36,214
so I thought I'd ask when I saw you.

316
00:17:36,215 --> 00:17:38,914
No, she's not my girlfriend.

317
00:17:38,915 --> 00:17:41,414
Not now, anyway.

318
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:44,514
You like her, then?

319
00:17:44,515 --> 00:17:47,514
I think you'd make a good couple.

320
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:51,214
She's my rival's sister.

321
00:17:51,215 --> 00:17:55,614
I can't tell her how I feel until I beat him.

322
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:57,014
Really?

323
00:17:57,015 --> 00:18:00,514
Don't tell tits over there about this.

324
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:01,614
Tits?

325
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:04,915
I'll never hear the end of it if she finds out.

326
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:08,414
That's all we talked about.

327
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:09,714
Really?

328
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,714
So you weren't cheating with his doppelganger

329
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,814
because you were frustrated with your unreliable husband?

330
00:18:14,815 --> 00:18:16,614
It's not cheating!

331
00:18:16,615 --> 00:18:21,114
Thanks to that photo, you nearly got to kiss.

332
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:22,914
You should be grateful.

333
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:24,314
Listen here.

334
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:26,514
Hey, Ran.

335
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:30,014
How did it feel to kiss him?

336
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,015
How did it feel?

337
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:34,414
Aren't you asking the wrong person?

338
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:38,114
I only kissed him on the cheek.

339
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:39,814
It was only on the cheek,

340
00:18:39,815 --> 00:18:43,415
but I kissed him like I was ready to leap from the Kiyomizu butai.

341
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:46,715
But he...

342
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:52,915
It's from Shinichi.

343
00:18:55,515 --> 00:18:57,314
Sorry, Ran.

344
00:18:57,315 --> 00:18:59,614
I wish I could've stayed with you a little longer,

345
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:02,514
but it didn't work out that way.

346
00:19:02,515 --> 00:19:07,014
But I'm really glad I got to hear your response to my confession.

347
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:08,415
Thanks.

348
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,114
Jeez.

349
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:15,314
I guess I'll forgive him.

350
00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:16,714
Yeah.

351
00:19:16,715 --> 00:19:18,914
There seems to be a medicine

352
00:19:18,915 --> 00:19:22,514
that can restore your body, Mom.

353
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:24,314
Then we'll do whatever it takes

354
00:19:24,315 --> 00:19:26,514
to find the inventor of this medicine,

355
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:28,514
and obtain the medicine itself.

356
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:32,215
Once I'm back in my old body, no more running around.

357
00:19:34,515 --> 00:19:36,514
We'll begin our counterattack.

358
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:38,615
Don't mess this up, Masumi.

359
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:50,514
Don't play with your phone while we're driving.

360
00:19:50,515 --> 00:19:51,814
It's dangerous.

361
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,114
I'm just going to look.

362
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:56,214
Thanks for the message.

363
00:19:56,215 --> 00:20:00,814
This means we're dating, right?

364
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:03,514
Oh, man. I wish I could respond right now.

365
00:20:03,515 --> 00:20:05,814
Anyway, I really panicked.

366
00:20:05,815 --> 00:20:07,714
I had to stuff you into my bag

367
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:11,714
while you were shrinking before my eyes.

368
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:15,014
You should've told me before it happened.

369
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:18,614
It wasn't so easy for me, either.

370
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:19,814
Did something happen?

371
00:20:19,815 --> 00:20:22,714
If you weren't watching, don't worry about it.

372
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:25,114
Yeah, I didn't see anything.

373
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:27,214
I definitely didn't see you and that girl

374
00:20:27,215 --> 00:20:30,714
smooching at the Kiyomizu butai.

375
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:32,814
So you were watching!

376
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,514
Listen, it was in the spur of the moment...

377
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:36,414
Gosh. The Kiyomizu butai was

378
00:20:36,415 --> 00:20:40,015
next on my list of breathtaking places to confess my feelings.

379
00:20:40,915 --> 00:20:42,815
And they even kissed?

380
00:20:44,715 --> 00:20:46,514
Gosh.

381
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:48,615
Making things harder when he doesn't need to.

382
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:14,714
It's all over the news here, too.

383
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:16,314
Of course, it is.

384
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:20,114
The victims and the killer were famous.

385
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:21,714
I'm surprised, though.

386
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:26,714
The killer's motive was the suicide of the man Kyoko loved.

387
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:27,814
Yeah.

388
00:22:27,815 --> 00:22:32,214
By the way, how did you know Michio Dekuri's name?

389
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:33,914
From the movie poster.

390
00:22:33,915 --> 00:22:35,914
What?

391
00:22:35,915 --> 00:22:39,315
Dekuri's name wasn't on the poster.

392
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:46,514
I thought there might be some reason

393
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:49,314
your actress friend changed her name.

394
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:54,515
If you cover the top and bottom of these unevenly spaced characters...

395
00:22:57,215 --> 00:22:58,215
You're right.

396
00:22:58,216 --> 00:23:01,115
"Michio Dekuri" -It says Michio Dekuri.

397
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:06,814
Since the poster was made after the first screening,

398
00:23:06,815 --> 00:23:10,414
it's possible Dekuri wouldn't have killed himself

399
00:23:10,415 --> 00:23:14,714
and Agata wouldn't have killed anybody if they'd seen it.

400
00:23:14,715 --> 00:23:16,114
Yeah.

401
00:23:16,115 --> 00:23:22,714
The problem is how Shinichi, the boy who shouldn't exist,

402
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:26,314
somehow solved this internationally newsworthy case.

403
00:23:26,315 --> 00:23:29,414
They're still only reporting that the case was solved

404
00:23:29,415 --> 00:23:32,014
by a group of high school detectives, though.

405
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:33,714
It'll be fine.

406
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:36,114
Shin's really thorough when it comes to that.

407
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,115
I'm sure he asked them to keep it secret.

408
00:23:40,515 --> 00:23:42,615
"Mouri Detective Agency"

409
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:45,114
I'm home!

410
00:23:45,115 --> 00:23:46,315
Great...

411
00:23:48,315 --> 00:23:51,614
Your daughter's back from her school trip.

412
00:23:51,615 --> 00:23:53,415
You should be welcoming her home.

413
00:23:55,215 --> 00:23:57,115
Is Conan upstairs?

414
00:24:00,515 --> 00:24:03,014
"No new messages" -He still hasn't responded.

415
00:24:03,015 --> 00:24:06,615
Did Shinichi read my message?

416
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:10,315
"This means we're dating, right? From Ran"

417
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:13,714
Hey. Are you listening, Kudo?

418
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:16,714
When we get to Tokyo, you're buying me a steak.

419
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:19,214
-Yeah. -Not a cheap one, either.

420
00:24:19,215 --> 00:24:23,215
One oozing with juices and, you know...

421
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,114
A really, really good one.

422
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:28,514
I know.

423
00:24:28,515 --> 00:24:31,215
I'll treat you. Don't worry about it.

424
00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:35,414
I shouldn't have offered to take you back to Tokyo.

425
00:24:35,415 --> 00:24:36,515
"Send"

426
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,215
A message.

427
00:24:45,715 --> 00:24:47,015
From Shinichi?

428
00:24:53,115 --> 00:24:55,315
"From: Shinichi Kudo. Subject: Idiot. Of course, we're dating."

429
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:05,215
"From: Shinichi Kudo. Subject: Idiot. Of course, we're dating."

430
00:25:09,915 --> 00:25:13,714
This means we're dating, right?

431
00:25:13,715 --> 00:25:17,615
Of course, we're dating.

432
00:25:21,915 --> 00:25:25,415
"Next Episode" -That's Saki Midorikawa.

433
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:35,914
It's their fault for allowing themselves to be blackmailed.

434
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:39,214
What were you looking at from your window?

435
00:25:39,215 --> 00:25:41,015
What? Who knows?

436
00:25:46,615 --> 00:25:51,915
Next Conan, "The Woman Standing by the Window (Part 1)"
