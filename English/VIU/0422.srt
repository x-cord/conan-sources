1
00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:02,710
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,810
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:06,510
Only a little more to go before sundown.

4
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:09,610
Will Dr. Agasa be able to meet his ginkgo colored first love?

5
00:00:09,611 --> 00:00:11,010
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,610
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:14,611
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,572 --> 00:02:00,971
A letter of 40 years ago comes out of Dr. Agasa's room.

9
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:04,171
The letter from Dr. Agasa's first love,

10
00:02:04,172 --> 00:02:05,871
said that she would like to meet him every 10 years

11
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:07,272
at the place memorable for both of them.

12
00:02:08,272 --> 00:02:10,271
A code and numbers that seem to indicate the place.

13
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:12,572
"The Hint Is: Animal" -were also written.

14
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:17,171
It coincidentally turns out that today is that day 40 years ago,

15
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:18,971
so after making deductions

16
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,272
we headed for the zoo.

17
00:02:20,972 --> 00:02:23,571
Hey, look good and hard.

18
00:02:23,572 --> 00:02:27,471
Yes. She's sure to be here somewhere.

19
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:30,071
Dr. Agasa's first love.

20
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:31,571
Hey, you guys...

21
00:02:31,572 --> 00:02:35,071
Hey, I wonder what that number is?

22
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:38,572
See, the number that is written on the name plate of the animals.

23
00:02:40,372 --> 00:02:41,772
-Flying squirrel! -Flying squirrel!

24
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:44,972
Dr. Agasa, there's someone there.

25
00:02:46,172 --> 00:02:48,572
She seems to be waiting for someone.

26
00:02:54,972 --> 00:03:00,871
"Ginkgo-Colored First Love (Part 2)"

27
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:02,071
"Nocturnal Animals Building."

28
00:03:02,072 --> 00:03:04,372
Dr. Agasa, there's someone there.

29
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:07,872
She seems to be waiting for someone.

30
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:13,071
She's not wearing a hat, but I'm sure it's her.

31
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:15,771
See. You're meeting her after 40 years,

32
00:03:15,772 --> 00:03:17,071
so go do your thing.

33
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,072
Yeah.

34
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:31,672
Excuse me, but are you...

35
00:03:36,472 --> 00:03:38,571
What, it's you, Mr. Hiroshi?

36
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:40,371
Oh! A man?

37
00:03:40,372 --> 00:03:42,871
Long time no see. How've you been?

38
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:45,371
Who could you be?

39
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:48,071
No, did you forget me?

40
00:03:48,072 --> 00:03:52,071
You used to come to my house a lot to look at my hamster.

41
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:55,971
Don't tell me that you're Mr. Haruo Chono?

42
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:58,771
I'm so happy that you remember me.

43
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,671
You took me for someone else, didn't you?

44
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:01,672
Yeah...

45
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:04,271
Because back then you were a boy with runny nose,

46
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:05,871
six years younger than me.

47
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:07,472
Oh, come off it!

48
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:09,671
I guess it's not her...

49
00:04:09,672 --> 00:04:11,271
Right...

50
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:13,371
And, what brings you here today?

51
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:14,471
Oh, come on, silly.

52
00:04:14,472 --> 00:04:17,271
What else but waiting for my boyfriend to come.

53
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:19,771
He likes squirrels and mice too.

54
00:04:19,772 --> 00:04:23,372
That's why we're meeting in front of these flying squirrels.

55
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:27,371
I see, wrong person again.

56
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:30,271
But, if she's somewhere in this zoo,

57
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:32,571
I'm sure he'll get to see her eventually.

58
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:37,471
Wait... We don't have time to be talking like that.

59
00:04:37,472 --> 00:04:40,271
There's only a little over an hour before sunset.

60
00:04:40,272 --> 00:04:41,571
Then, we've got no other choice

61
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,571
than for the Sleeping Kogoro or the noisy Sonoko

62
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:45,871
to solve this for us.

63
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:47,271
Can't you get a hold of them?

64
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:50,671
Pops is at a live, so it's impossible.

65
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:55,671
Sonoko is with Ran, so I can get a hold of her but...

66
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:57,571
Then please call her.

67
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:58,572
Because if he misses today,

68
00:04:58,573 --> 00:05:01,271
he won't get to see her for the next 10 years.

69
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:03,472
I think it won't help to call, though...

70
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,672
Yes, hello?

71
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:10,171
Oh? Conan.

72
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:15,071
Yes, we're still in line to buy Fusae Brand limited edition goods.

73
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:17,071
Is Sonoko there?

74
00:05:17,072 --> 00:05:21,072
She went off to buy hamburgers so she's not here.

75
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:24,972
It's okay if she's not there. Bye.

76
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:27,171
She's not there...

77
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:28,571
What?

78
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:29,972
No...

79
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:33,271
Ran!

80
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:34,772
Here, I bought it!

81
00:05:35,972 --> 00:05:37,672
What? You got a phone call?

82
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,172
What?

83
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,271
It's your hubby, isn't it?

84
00:05:41,272 --> 00:05:44,872
What? No, it was Conan! From Conan!

85
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:47,871
Honest!

86
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:51,171
Conan just called me asking for you.

87
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:52,971
What? What?

88
00:05:52,972 --> 00:05:55,571
He said, it's okay if you're not around...

89
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:56,771
Do you want to call him back?

90
00:05:56,772 --> 00:06:00,371
Never mind. Getting involved with him only brings trouble.

91
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:03,671
Besides, it's kind of unusual that you want

92
00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:05,571
to buy brand name goods, Ran.

93
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:07,471
Yeah, a little.

94
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:10,471
I made a promise with someone in the past.

95
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:13,271
I promised some time ago so.

96
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,871
I think that person already forgot, though.

97
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:18,671
"Nocturnal Animals Building" -Ms. Kinoshita! Ms. Kinoshita!

98
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:20,771
Mr. Agasa is waiting for you,

99
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:23,772
please come to the Nocturnal Animals Building immediately.

100
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:29,671
She doesn't seem to be here.

101
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:33,072
I see. I'm sorry to bother you.

102
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:36,671
That was our last resort.

103
00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:38,771
Dr. Agasa. Can't you remember anything yet?

104
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:42,171
This zoo is a memorable place for you, isn't it?

105
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:45,571
No... I've come here for the first time.

106
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,971
What? Didn't you come here with the girl who wrote this postcard?

107
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:52,571
No... She wanted to come here, though.

108
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:56,071
In other words, this place was not the right place to begin with.

109
00:06:56,072 --> 00:06:58,471
Why didn't you tell us so to begin with?

110
00:06:58,472 --> 00:07:02,671
I'm sorry. You were all trying so hard so.

111
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,571
But, you've done enough already.

112
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:07,571
-What? -I'm contented.

113
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:10,271
As for memories about her, I will keep it untouched

114
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:14,071
and beautiful as it used to be within my heart.

115
00:07:14,072 --> 00:07:16,871
I don't want her to see my hair like this either.

116
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:17,872
Dr. Agasa...

117
00:07:17,873 --> 00:07:19,372
Shall we head home then.

118
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:39,671
Here, your hat.

119
00:07:39,672 --> 00:07:41,571
No! Don't look!

120
00:07:41,572 --> 00:07:42,972
Please!

121
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:46,771
Here you go, hold it nice and tight.

122
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:47,772
Okay...

123
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:50,471
What's up, Dr. Agasa?

124
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:51,571
Oh, well...

125
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:55,571
I just remembered something about her hair.

126
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:57,171
Hair?

127
00:07:57,172 --> 00:08:00,071
Yeah... She had black eyes,

128
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:02,871
but the color of her hair was different.

129
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:05,371
Her hair wasn't really brown.

130
00:08:05,372 --> 00:08:11,871
Blonde... One of her parents was not Japanese.

131
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:14,971
That's why she wore her cap deeply over her head all the time.

132
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:17,171
She didn't want to be teased from everyone else at school

133
00:08:17,172 --> 00:08:19,671
because the color of her hair was different.

134
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:21,771
When I was in Americans,

135
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:25,471
I experienced being teased because of my Asian looks,

136
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,171
so I understand how she feels.

137
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:29,271
Which means that you're...

138
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:31,071
Oh, really?

139
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:34,171
Yes. My mother's British.

140
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:35,671
Didn't I tell you before?

141
00:08:35,672 --> 00:08:37,971
Ayumi, will you show me that postcard?

142
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:38,972
Okay.

143
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:42,271
Did you figure something out, Conan?

144
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,372
Conan?

145
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:46,772
If so, this code may be...

146
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:50,071
"The Hint Is: Animal" -The meaning of these numbers are...

147
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,971
Hey, Dr. Agasa! Did that girl have a pet or something?

148
00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:55,271
Oh yeah...

149
00:08:55,272 --> 00:08:58,771
They seem to have had a dog when she was little.

150
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:03,772
But, she said that after she was bitten, they had no pets.

151
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:09,471
Wait... Conan!

152
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:11,371
Then, don't tell me...

153
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:12,372
Don't tell me...

154
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,271
I see, so that's it.

155
00:09:18,272 --> 00:09:20,972
That's what the numbers of the code meant.

156
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:25,571
I got it, Dr. Agasa.

157
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:28,371
The memorable place that she's waiting for you.

158
00:09:28,372 --> 00:09:30,171
It's a place we know very well too.

159
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:31,271
"The Hint Is: Animal."

160
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:33,272
It's over there!

161
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,608
"Nocturnal Animals Building."

162
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:43,054
What? You've figured it out?

163
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:46,154
The place where Dr. Agasa's first love is waiting?

164
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:49,454
Yeah. After it's solved, it's no big deal.

165
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,254
It's a place we all know very well too.

166
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:53,354
We know it too?

167
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:55,254
Where is it?

168
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:57,654
You go there five times a week too, Genta.

169
00:09:57,655 --> 00:09:59,254
Five times a week?

170
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:02,254
I see the cake shop in front of my house everyday.

171
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:05,054
I go to the yakiniku shop on the corner once a month.

172
00:10:05,055 --> 00:10:08,554
So? Hurry up and answer!

173
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:11,454
She can only wait until the sun goes down, you know.

174
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:12,854
Hold your horses!

175
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:15,954
If we speed there by car it won't even take 20 minutes.

176
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:19,654
First for the code written on back of the postcard about the place.

177
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:23,554
This 4163, 33, 6, and 0...

178
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:26,654
is like the hint says, stands for an animal.

179
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:28,854
What? Just what're you talking about?

180
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:31,554
The donkey and the flying squirrel were wrong!

181
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:33,954
It's not a name.

182
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:35,654
It's the cry of the animal!

183
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:36,954
Cry of the animal?

184
00:10:36,955 --> 00:10:40,554
Yeah. It's the number of letters used to write how the animal cries.

185
00:10:40,555 --> 00:10:43,354
The number of letters of their cries...

186
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:47,654
Then, what does the number six of the code stand for?

187
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:50,454
A cat cries "mew", so it's three letters in Japanese character.

188
00:10:50,455 --> 00:10:52,554
Cry of cicada is seven letters.

189
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:55,454
That's not an animal, it's an insect.

190
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,854
A crow goes caw, so it's two letters.

191
00:10:57,855 --> 00:11:00,255
A horse neighs, so it's four letters.

192
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:03,854
"Squeak" is for mice.

193
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:05,554
Mice?

194
00:11:05,555 --> 00:11:07,154
Don't mices go "chu"?

195
00:11:07,155 --> 00:11:10,154
See, it's written by the explanation

196
00:11:10,155 --> 00:11:11,954
of the Indian Flying Fox too.

197
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:14,754
In English, the Indian Flying Squirrel cries squeak,

198
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:17,554
like mice.

199
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:20,754
One of her parents is not Japanese.

200
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:24,654
I don't know whether her parents spoke to her in English but...

201
00:11:24,655 --> 00:11:28,354
It's exactly six letters so the possibility is high.

202
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,354
-I see. -I get it.

203
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:31,954
True.

204
00:11:31,955 --> 00:11:36,554
But mice are not the only animals whose cry is six letters.

205
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:39,954
That's true, but the animal that has something

206
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:42,355
to do with the girl of your memory is?

207
00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:45,854
Right! A hamster!

208
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:48,854
Which means that the house of the person named Mr. Chono

209
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:53,354
that you used to go over a lot to, with her is the place!

210
00:11:53,355 --> 00:11:57,154
But the place in the code is somewhere that I go a lot too, right?

211
00:11:57,155 --> 00:11:59,254
I don't know that person's house!

212
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:00,954
Besides, I already told you, didn't I?

213
00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:05,754
That I went there 20 years ago but she didn't come.

214
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:07,254
Hold your horses!

215
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:10,154
Only the number six part of the code has been solved.

216
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:14,654
The 4163 and 33 animal is left!

217
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:18,854
I don't think there are animals that cry that long.

218
00:12:18,855 --> 00:12:22,354
Then, what if we separate the numbers like so

219
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:24,355
four, one, six, three and three, three.

220
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:28,954
Four, one, six, three and three, three...

221
00:12:28,955 --> 00:12:30,454
A dog barks, "one-one" (bow-wow)

222
00:12:30,455 --> 00:12:32,154
so it should come out to 11...

223
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:33,954
Three, three sounds like "min-min".

224
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:36,254
It's the cry of a cidada after all.

225
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,854
Don't tell me...

226
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:39,655
It's a rooster and a dog.

227
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:44,554
The rooster cries cock-a-doodle-doo in English,

228
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,554
a dog, bow-wow, so the number of letters match perfectly!

229
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:50,654
A cook's a doodling?

230
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:53,154
The rooster cries "coke-kokko", don't they?

231
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:56,354
That's how the cries sound to Americans.

232
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:59,054
Then the roosters must be at elementary school

233
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:01,454
and the dog and the Mr. Noi's house?

234
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:04,554
Yes. She seems to have liked taking care

235
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:05,954
of the roosters at school too,

236
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:09,154
and the Mr. Noi's house is where you first met each other!

237
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,954
But, the zero hasn't been solved yet.

238
00:13:11,955 --> 00:13:14,854
Are there animals that don't cry?

239
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:16,254
It's not that the animal doesn't cry...

240
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,455
There are no animals there!

241
00:13:19,855 --> 00:13:22,154
I see! It's her house!

242
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:25,554
Her parents stopped having pets.

243
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:29,354
So, zero is Ms. Kinoshita's house.

244
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:32,154
But, where is she waiting?

245
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:35,454
She can't possibly wait at four places at one time.

246
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:37,954
Then try connecting the four places

247
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:40,454
in the order that they're written.

248
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:44,354
Let's see. First, it's the elementary school...

249
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:45,654
Noi...

250
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:46,954
Chono...

251
00:13:46,955 --> 00:13:48,255
Kinoshita...

252
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:50,554
Elementary school...

253
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:51,555
Noi...

254
00:13:51,555 --> 00:13:52,555
Chono...

255
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:54,354
Kinoshita...

256
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:57,154
Under the ginkgo lined-street!

257
00:13:57,155 --> 00:14:01,554
Yeah. I'm sure she's waiting there.

258
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:04,455
If her feelings of 40 years ago haven't waned...

259
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:09,054
Hey, wait a second, Conan.

260
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:12,154
There's nobody around.

261
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:15,954
Strange. I'm sure it's here.

262
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,454
Well, it's only natural that she's not here.

263
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:21,954
After all, it's a promise we made 40 years ago.

264
00:14:21,955 --> 00:14:23,054
Dr. Agasa...

265
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:24,955
It's still there...

266
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:28,454
See, that white car.

267
00:14:28,455 --> 00:14:31,354
It was parked there when we went to check on the rabbits

268
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:33,254
this morning too.

269
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:36,554
I'm sure she was waiting in the car all the way from morning!

270
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:38,854
Okay, let's go check it out then!

271
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:39,855
Okay!

272
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:40,855
Hey...

273
00:14:45,855 --> 00:14:47,354
Nobody's inside.

274
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:50,354
Maybe the person went out to get a bite to eat.

275
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:52,554
No, I don't think so.

276
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:55,354
The coffee from the fast food store is still steaming hot.

277
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:58,354
It looks to have been eaten just a while ago.

278
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,954
It's quite a lot of food.

279
00:15:00,955 --> 00:15:02,954
There are enough to feed three people.

280
00:15:02,955 --> 00:15:06,054
I hope he won't get freaked out

281
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:07,155
even if she's super plump.

282
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:29,954
What a beauty...

283
00:15:29,955 --> 00:15:32,454
That can't be her.

284
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,354
She's too good for him.

285
00:15:34,355 --> 00:15:36,754
Hey, Dr. Agasa, come on.

286
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:39,154
You made her wait 40 years, didn't you?

287
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:43,154
Oh, well, I don't really know if it's her yet.

288
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:44,355
Get on with it.

289
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:54,955
Excuse me...

290
00:15:57,655 --> 00:15:58,655
Fusae?

291
00:16:01,455 --> 00:16:03,754
A... A man?

292
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:08,455
Billy, would you mind stepping outside for a moment?#eng.

293
00:16:09,555 --> 00:16:12,055
Okay, take your time.

294
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:15,755
Excuse me.

295
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:25,154
Excuse me...

296
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:27,954
They sure are cute grandchildren.

297
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:30,454
Yes... I guess...

298
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:33,154
Excuse me, pardon me for asking...

299
00:16:33,155 --> 00:16:35,854
I just happened to pass by here this morning

300
00:16:35,855 --> 00:16:38,155
and these ginkgo trees caught my attention.

301
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:41,954
They were so vivid.

302
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:44,055
That I came back again.

303
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:49,854
Do you not like ginkgo trees?

304
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:52,154
Oh, no...

305
00:16:52,155 --> 00:16:54,854
They're really beautiful.

306
00:16:54,855 --> 00:16:58,855
What? Wait a second. She's...

307
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,455
Hey, little girl.

308
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:09,154
Are you waiting for somebody too, little girl?

309
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:10,754
Nope.

310
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:13,354
I forgot my umbrella so I'm taking shelter from the rain

311
00:17:13,355 --> 00:17:14,554
until it stops.

312
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:16,554
Is that so?

313
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:17,755
Okay...

314
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:21,254
I'll give you my umbrella.

315
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:23,454
But, then you're going to get wet.

316
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,554
It's okay, because I feel like getting wet today.

317
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:27,954
But...

318
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:29,954
Let's do this then.

319
00:17:29,955 --> 00:17:32,854
In place of the umbrella, when you grow up,

320
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:38,654
will you buy just one accessory or handbag that I designed, okay?

321
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:42,054
My design is this ginkgo leaf.

322
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:45,954
I'm not famous yet, but I'll do my best.

323
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:48,354
-Okay. -Promise.

324
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:49,654
Okay!

325
00:17:49,655 --> 00:17:50,755
Hey, Ran!

326
00:17:51,755 --> 00:17:52,954
What're you doing?

327
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:54,554
Shinichi!

328
00:17:54,555 --> 00:17:56,555
Thank you so much!

329
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,254
If this woman is the one we saw back then...

330
00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:08,355
She is no doubt Dr. Agasa's first love 40 years ago.

331
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,054
Okay, goodbye then.

332
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:12,055
Goodbye.

333
00:18:13,255 --> 00:18:16,054
My husband's seems to be getting annoyed too, so...

334
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:17,555
I'm so sorry.

335
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:27,154
Well, Dr. Agasa, how was it?

336
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:28,155
It was her, right?

337
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:30,055
She's your first love, right?

338
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:34,055
Dr. Agasa?

339
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:41,054
You mean, that's all, Ms. Fusae?

340
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:43,354
After you waited 40 years to meet the man,

341
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,254
you've been looking forward to seeing.

342
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:46,255
Yes...

343
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:50,754
I didn't tell him who I was after all.

344
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,854
Well, although it's only natural,

345
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:57,054
it seems he already has a happy family.

346
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:58,654
Besides, if he finds out that he had made

347
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:00,954
a stupid woman wait for 40 years,

348
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:03,755
it'll probably break his heart.

349
00:19:05,255 --> 00:19:07,454
You're really understanding about a man.

350
00:19:07,455 --> 00:19:10,654
You haven't met for 40 years, aren't you?

351
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:14,755
When my hat was blown away here...

352
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,154
No! Don't look!

353
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:21,254
Because my hair is funny!

354
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:23,155
It's different from everybody's!

355
00:19:27,255 --> 00:19:28,355
Really?

356
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,754
I like it. See...

357
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:37,455
It's just like this ginkgo leaf and pretty!

358
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:54,055
I think he forgot already though.

359
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:05,355
I'm sorry, Billy.

360
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:09,454
For making you my mother's new husband's friend,

361
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:13,354
keep me company every 10 years for something like this.

362
00:20:13,355 --> 00:20:17,054
Don't be. My wife would get mad at me if I refused.

363
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:20,254
After all, she's a great fan of the Fusae Brand.

364
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:24,254
But, today is the last day you'll have to do this.

365
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:25,555
Will you start off?

366
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:28,955
Are you really sure?

367
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:32,154
Never mind, will you, please.

368
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:34,355
Okay, boss.

369
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:57,355
I still love ginkgo leaves very much even now!

370
00:21:08,255 --> 00:21:10,754
Excuse me, Billy?

371
00:21:10,755 --> 00:21:12,655
What? What is it?

372
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:18,355
Maybe I'll ask you to keep me company again 10 years later?

373
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:25,554
No. I don't think it will take you

374
00:21:25,555 --> 00:21:28,455
that long to see each other again.

375
00:23:05,855 --> 00:23:09,054
It sure was a code that was forced making.

376
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,554
It can't be helped.

377
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,054
The person who makes the code is free

378
00:23:12,055 --> 00:23:13,754
to think up whatever she wishes.

379
00:23:13,755 --> 00:23:16,154
Besides, when she thought up that code,

380
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:18,554
she was still in grade school.

381
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:21,454
It's a cute childish code.

382
00:23:21,455 --> 00:23:23,455
You're a kid yourself too.

383
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:30,454
Dr. Agasa's first love was really beautiful, wasn't she?

384
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:32,054
Yes.

385
00:23:32,055 --> 00:23:34,754
A gingko leaf...

386
00:23:34,755 --> 00:23:36,454
Dr. Agasa?

387
00:23:36,455 --> 00:23:37,655
You're looking sort of lewd.

388
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:42,854
-Ms. Kinoshita, -Ms. Kinoshita,

389
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,254
-I still love ginkgo leaves -I still love ginkgo leaves

390
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:45,954
-very much even now! -very much even now!

391
00:23:45,955 --> 00:23:49,254
Hey, it's not nice to tease adults!

392
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:50,754
-Ms. Kinoshita, -Ms. Kinoshita,

393
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:51,954
-I still love ginkgo leaves -I still love ginkgo leaves

394
00:23:51,955 --> 00:23:54,355
-very much even now! -very much even now!

395
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:02,054
"Next Episode."

396
00:24:02,055 --> 00:24:04,654
A boy who lives near that house.

397
00:24:04,655 --> 00:24:06,455
Who wears a white baseball cap?

398
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:09,354
-It's Keiichi! -It's Keiichi!

399
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:10,754
Denied everything?

400
00:24:10,755 --> 00:24:13,854
Keiichi says that he didn't go out last night,

401
00:24:13,855 --> 00:24:16,754
the night before or the night before last either.

402
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,655
Why is he hiding it?

403
00:24:23,555 --> 00:24:28,855
Next Conan, "The Youth Detective Squad and Four Caterpillar Brothers".

404
00:24:44,755 --> 00:24:46,954
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:46,955 --> 00:24:48,854
"Olive leaf."

406
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:50,554
The next episode is about a kind hearted boy.

407
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:51,854
Which means...

408
00:24:51,855 --> 00:24:53,755
I haven't said anything yet!
