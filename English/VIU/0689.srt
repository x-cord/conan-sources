1
00:00:01,094 --> 00:00:04,094
So that person who requested you to investigate

2
00:00:04,094 --> 00:00:05,994
whether her boyfriend was cheating on her.

3
00:00:05,994 --> 00:00:08,894
Yeah. She passed away.

4
00:00:08,894 --> 00:00:11,294
She fell down a flight of stone stairs.

5
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:14,394
"Kaoru Mizumori (24), deceased" -Tsuge! You've got the nerve!

6
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:16,194
Huh? What're you talking about?

7
00:00:16,194 --> 00:00:17,494
Don't play dumb with me!

8
00:00:17,494 --> 00:00:20,394
"Takashi Sasamori(28)" -You intended to have a little fun, right?

9
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:23,394
And Kaoru who pressed you to marry her got in your way,

10
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:26,294
"Hikari Tsuga (33)" -so you pushed her down the stairs!

11
00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:28,194
What a stupid thing to say.

12
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:32,894
I saw you at the top of the stone stairs from where Kaoru fell!

13
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:35,294
Wait. Please stop!

14
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:36,694
"Mariko Noguchi (30)" -That matter was thoroughly

15
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:39,494
investigated by the police and the misunderstanding was solved!

16
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:40,694
Silence!

17
00:00:40,694 --> 00:00:42,794
The police may have been fooled, but not me!

18
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:44,094
Please stop!

19
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:47,094
Please stop it, both of you!

20
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:50,294
"Kazumi Ishikura (25)" -Please don't talk that way in front of Kaoru.

21
00:00:50,294 --> 00:00:52,794
Let her rest in peace, please.

22
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:55,194
That young lady is right.

23
00:00:55,194 --> 00:00:58,694
You should keep in mind where you are.

24
00:00:58,694 --> 00:01:01,194
No matter how much you detest me,

25
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,994
I'm not the killer.

26
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:04,594
Excuse me.

27
00:01:04,594 --> 00:01:06,894
Wait, Mr. Tsuge.

28
00:01:06,894 --> 00:01:09,294
That was 3 months ago.

29
00:01:09,294 --> 00:01:11,994
Then, this morning Mr. Tsuge suddenly calls you and says,

30
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:16,394
"I'll tell you about the killer back then, so please come."

31
00:01:16,394 --> 00:01:17,894
Yeah.

32
00:01:21,594 --> 00:01:23,394
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

33
00:01:23,394 --> 00:01:25,594
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

34
00:01:25,594 --> 00:01:27,294
What was the real purpose of the artist

35
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:29,194
behind the queer artifact?

36
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:30,794
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:32,794
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:35,294
His name is Detective Conan!

39
00:03:15,303 --> 00:03:21,003
"Message from a Client"

40
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:28,203
Did something happen?

41
00:03:28,203 --> 00:03:31,603
Yes, there was a landslide ahead.

42
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:34,003
This road is inaccessible.

43
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:35,603
Is that right?

44
00:03:35,603 --> 00:03:39,603
We're on our way to that house over there.

45
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:41,203
You are, too.

46
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:44,003
In that case, that road is fine.

47
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:45,803
Thanks.

48
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:50,703
Darn it. I can barely see ahead.

49
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:54,303
Can you handle? Be careful, Dad.

50
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:56,603
Is anyone else coming?

51
00:03:56,603 --> 00:04:00,603
Yeah, he said he also called the three people

52
00:04:00,603 --> 00:04:02,703
who made a commotion at the funeral.

53
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:12,303
There are people here before us, as expected.

54
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:24,103
Mr. Mouri, you were called over by Tsuge too?

55
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:25,603
Yes.

56
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:32,903
What heavy rain.

57
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:34,803
Come, let's go inside.

58
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:41,603
Whose car is this?

59
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:43,003
It's Tsuge's car.

60
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:45,603
He's been cooped up in this atelier for the past three months

61
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:49,203
working on his artwork.

62
00:04:49,203 --> 00:04:52,403
Oh, no. The door's not locked.

63
00:04:52,403 --> 00:04:54,903
Mr. Tsuge, it's me, Noguchi.

64
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:01,103
-Here. -Thank you.

65
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:04,203
I forgot my umbrella.

66
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,603
Thank you.

67
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:07,003
Not at all.

68
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:10,003
You'd better hurry and dry yourself up.

69
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,803
Mr. Tsuge!

70
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:26,703
It's too late.

71
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:29,003
Ran! Call the police!

72
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:30,903
Yes!

73
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:32,803
I will preserve the scene,

74
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:35,603
so please leave the room, everyone!

75
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:37,803
Wait.

76
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:41,103
Please don't touch the artifact no matter what.

77
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:43,703
Huh? Artifact?

78
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:46,603
It's just junk put together.

79
00:05:46,603 --> 00:05:48,703
Is there any meaning to that stuff?

80
00:05:48,703 --> 00:05:50,603
How rude!

81
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:52,603
Are you making fun of Mr. Tsuge's artwork?

82
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,203
Okay, okay.

83
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:57,003
Anyway, I'll inform the police about it,

84
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:59,903
so please leave this room for now.

85
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:03,203
Really? I'm really counting on you, all right?

86
00:06:03,203 --> 00:06:05,103
Yes, yes, I got it.

87
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:09,003
What's this?

88
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:11,303
There's no dust only on top of the tape.

89
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:15,003
Which means, there was something on it till just a while ago.

90
00:06:15,003 --> 00:06:16,803
Is that a screen?

91
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:21,403
"Demurrer"...

92
00:06:21,403 --> 00:06:24,203
If I remember correctly, it means "objection" or something to that effect.

93
00:06:24,203 --> 00:06:26,203
Hey, you!

94
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:28,503
Don't wander around on your own!

95
00:06:28,503 --> 00:06:30,403
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:33,803 --> 00:06:37,303
I wonder what on earth was there.

97
00:06:37,303 --> 00:06:40,303
And who moved it.

98
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,103
There's nothing inside this room that's a likely object.

99
00:06:46,103 --> 00:06:49,903
Which means that the culprit took it outside, after all.

100
00:06:50,903 --> 00:06:53,003
The victim is Hikari Tsuge.

101
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:56,403
His real name is Ritsu Hikage, 33 years old.

102
00:06:56,403 --> 00:06:58,703
His profession is a sculptor.

103
00:06:58,703 --> 00:07:01,103
By the way, it seems that Hikari Tsuge is

104
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:03,903
an anagram of Ritsu Hikage, his real name.

105
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,603
An anagram, you mean like

106
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:09,203
when the characters are rearranged to make a different word?

107
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:11,103
Yes. The cause of death was

108
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,703
an occipital blow leading to intracranial injury.

109
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:16,403
The hammer which is thought to be the murder weapon

110
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,103
was found on the floor nearby,

111
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:20,403
but the fingerprints were all wiped clean.

112
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:24,803
I'd like to ask you again.

113
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:27,203
You were all told by the victim that he would tell you

114
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:29,403
who the culprit that committed the crime 3 months ago was

115
00:07:29,403 --> 00:07:31,303
and invited you all here, correct?

116
00:07:31,303 --> 00:07:32,903
Yes, Inspector.

117
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:34,603
However, when we got here,

118
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:38,503
he was already dead and the culprit had fled.

119
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:41,203
About that, Mr. Mouri...

120
00:07:41,203 --> 00:07:43,403
According to the officer at the checkpoint,

121
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:48,103
no one had gone down the road that leads out of the atelier.

122
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:51,103
Which means that the culprit is still somewhere nearby?

123
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,703
That's very likely.

124
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:56,903
No, there were only 4 cars to begin with that didn't make a U-turn

125
00:07:56,903 --> 00:08:00,603
and came up the slope, the officer said.

126
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:01,903
Only 4 cars?

127
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:05,903
Me, and Kazumi, Mr. Sasamori, Mr. Mouri and his party.

128
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,803
Which means that the culprit is among us.

129
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:15,003
I see. There's only one road coming up here,

130
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:17,003
and there's a checkpoint up ahead.

131
00:08:17,003 --> 00:08:21,703
Fleeing down the dark slope in this rain is impossible.

132
00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:24,703
It's indeed a closed circle.

133
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:27,503
No, that can't be!

134
00:08:27,503 --> 00:08:31,403
Because we were the first to get here,

135
00:08:31,403 --> 00:08:33,803
and everybody else came after us.

136
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:36,203
Right! I was up front.

137
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:38,403
And behind him was me.

138
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:40,503
Then lastly, Ms. Noguchi.

139
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:45,203
We entered the atelier together and found the body.

140
00:08:45,203 --> 00:08:46,603
I see.

141
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:50,003
But when we told the officer

142
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:52,203
that we were coming to this atelier,

143
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:55,303
the officer said, "You are, too."

144
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:58,903
Doesn't that mean that there was another car

145
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:01,103
that came to the atelier before us?

146
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:04,703
If we ask that officer about the model of the car or the driver,

147
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:06,403
maybe we'll find out about the culprit?

148
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:10,003
The thing is, he says he remembers that there were 4 cars,

149
00:09:10,003 --> 00:09:12,003
but he doesn't remember the model of the cars

150
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:14,403
or the face of the drivers.

151
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:17,903
How would I be able to tell about things like that in this downpour?

152
00:09:17,903 --> 00:09:20,003
Come on, mister.

153
00:09:20,003 --> 00:09:23,903
Okay, so if we organize what's been said, is this it.

154
00:09:23,903 --> 00:09:27,103
There was one car here already at the atelier.

155
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:30,603
This was the car of Mr. Tsuge who was killed.

156
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,303
Then, Mouri and his group arrived.

157
00:09:33,303 --> 00:09:36,303
After that, 3 cars came successively. That makes 4 cars.

158
00:09:36,303 --> 00:09:38,603
However, according to the officer,

159
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:41,503
a car went by before the one Conan was in.

160
00:09:41,503 --> 00:09:43,303
Which means that...

161
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:47,703
The car of the culprit arrived first.

162
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:49,603
Then, after killing Mr. Tsuge,

163
00:09:49,603 --> 00:09:52,503
the culprit left the atelier, hid somewhere,

164
00:09:52,503 --> 00:09:54,503
waited for everyone to arrive

165
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:57,203
and joined everyone as if nothing had happened.

166
00:09:57,203 --> 00:09:58,703
Is that it?

167
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:01,003
What is the motive for the crime, then?

168
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:04,103
Of course to shut him up.

169
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,303
Hearing that Mr. Tsuge would reveal

170
00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:10,703
who killed Kaoru Sasamori 3 months ago,

171
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:12,603
the culprit came to the atelier before everyone else,

172
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:14,803
and killed Mr. Tsuge.

173
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:17,403
In other words, the culprit for this case,

174
00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:20,403
is also the one who killed Ms. Kaoru Sasamori!

175
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:22,803
And that person is...

176
00:10:27,803 --> 00:10:30,903
One of you three!

177
00:10:32,103 --> 00:10:33,403
Really cool!

178
00:10:33,403 --> 00:10:37,403
Anyone could see that considering the circumstances.

179
00:10:38,103 --> 00:10:43,503
The problem is to figure out who of the three is the culprit.

180
00:10:51,656 --> 00:10:53,456
Hold it.

181
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:57,556
Let's say the culprit is one among the three of us.

182
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,256
Would Tsuge who knew that,

183
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:01,656
go out of his way to call the culprit over?

184
00:11:01,656 --> 00:11:04,856
Maybe he wanted to pretend being a detective?

185
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:08,256
He had a childish side to him, you know.

186
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:09,756
True.

187
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:12,556
He probably went out of his way to call everyone over

188
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:14,656
because he wanted to say, "The culprit is among you!"

189
00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:16,656
Don't you think?

190
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:18,156
It's just like what he would think up.

191
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:20,856
Well, I'm not the one who did it.

192
00:11:20,856 --> 00:11:24,856
I had a date for a meal with my younger sister that day.

193
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:27,456
But shooting the film ran late,

194
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:30,056
so I went to meet her where she was waiting, a bit late.

195
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:35,356
Kaoru!

196
00:11:35,356 --> 00:11:37,856
Are you all right, Kaoru?

197
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:40,156
Somebody pushed me from behind.

198
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:42,756
Were you pushed down?

199
00:11:42,756 --> 00:11:45,856
Back then, I saw

200
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:48,056
Tsuge at the top of the stone stairs.

201
00:11:48,956 --> 00:11:53,256
So, I thought that Tsuge was the culprit.

202
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:55,456
But it wasn't so.

203
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:58,656
Mr. Tsuge was a witness to the crime.

204
00:11:58,656 --> 00:12:01,456
That's why I could never be the culprit.

205
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:05,156
But you don't have any witness, do you?

206
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:08,556
Then, are you saying that I'm lying?

207
00:12:08,556 --> 00:12:10,556
Kaoru is my younger sister, you know!

208
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:13,056
But you didn't get along with her, did you?

209
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:15,256
I heard from Kaoru

210
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:16,956
that she was on bad terms with her older brother

211
00:12:16,956 --> 00:12:19,256
over the estate left behind by her parents.

212
00:12:19,256 --> 00:12:21,056
She told you about that, too.

213
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:23,156
So, angered at her,

214
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:26,256
you pushed her from the stone stairs, didn't you?

215
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:27,756
What did you say?

216
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:30,256
Hold it, Kazumi.

217
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:33,356
You sure sound like a lady worried over her best friend,

218
00:12:33,356 --> 00:12:37,056
but you also have a motive for wanting to kill Kaoru, don't you?

219
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:40,156
Just what do you mean?

220
00:12:40,156 --> 00:12:43,556
Tsuge had another woman besides Kaoru.

221
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:44,556
What?

222
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:50,256
She hired Mr. Mouri here to find out who that woman was.

223
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:52,556
That's right.

224
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:56,356
Then, who's that other woman?

225
00:12:56,356 --> 00:12:59,056
Right, it's Ms. Kazumi Ishikura.

226
00:13:00,756 --> 00:13:03,056
I didn't know either.

227
00:13:03,056 --> 00:13:05,556
That he was also going out with Kaoru.

228
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:10,256
What?

229
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,156
I was proposed by Mr. Tsuge!

230
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:14,356
What shall I do?

231
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:15,956
What's this?

232
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:22,156
What does this mean, Mr. Tsuge?

233
00:13:22,156 --> 00:13:25,856
I'm talking about work, so we'll talk about it later.

234
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:27,756
Since when have you been going out with Kaoru?

235
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:30,956
-It's not what you think! -Don't take me lightly!

236
00:13:30,956 --> 00:13:34,556
Break up with her! Break up with Kaoru!

237
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:39,056
It's not that you don't have a motive, either, is it?

238
00:13:39,056 --> 00:13:40,656
What?

239
00:13:40,656 --> 00:13:42,556
I heard from Kaoru.

240
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,856
Kaoru, this.

241
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:46,756
What's this?

242
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:48,756
There's 1,000,000 yen inside.

243
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:50,856
I want you to break up with Tsuge.

244
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:52,156
Oh, no.

245
00:13:52,156 --> 00:13:54,256
Ever since he started going out with you,

246
00:13:54,256 --> 00:13:56,456
Tsuge's stopped working.

247
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:58,056
So, take this and break up with him.

248
00:13:58,056 --> 00:13:59,456
I'm leaving!

249
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:03,756
I heard that the clients were looking for other artists

250
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:07,856
because Tsuge virtually didn't work.

251
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:10,056
If so, you would have to pay an exorbitant penalty fee

252
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:11,456
for breach of contract.

253
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:15,056
And that's why you're saying that I killed Kaoru?

254
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:17,356
It's true that since she passed away,

255
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,756
Tsuge was obsessed in making artwork.

256
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:23,056
But that has nothing to do with me!

257
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:31,656
Hey, Officer Takagi.

258
00:14:31,656 --> 00:14:33,456
What is it, Conan?

259
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,256
Pops Kogoro asked me to tell you something.

260
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:38,656
He said he wanted you to look for a place

261
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:42,456
from the checkpoint to here where a car could be hidden.

262
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:43,856
Okay.

263
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,156
Maybe around here?

264
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:57,056
I'll go take a look.

265
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:59,056
Conan!

266
00:14:59,056 --> 00:15:00,056
It's true.

267
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:01,456
If here, the car that comes up from the slope

268
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:02,556
won't be able to see anything

269
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:03,656
because the hut over there will block the view.

270
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:06,256
Which means...

271
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:07,856
So, this is it.

272
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:10,956
This is what the culprit took away from the scene of the crime.

273
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:13,956
If so, that was...

274
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:17,356
Then, everyone.

275
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:21,256
I would like to ask each one of you some more questions

276
00:15:21,256 --> 00:15:24,156
so please come with me to the station.

277
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:29,856
-Dad? -It's come! Sleeping Kogoro!

278
00:15:29,856 --> 00:15:31,956
There's no need to go to the station,

279
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:35,056
Inspector, I shall settle the case here and now.

280
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:36,456
What?

281
00:15:36,456 --> 00:15:40,756
When I found Mr. Tsuge's body in this atelier,

282
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:43,656
I found that the trace of something had disappeared.

283
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:46,756
-Something? -Judging from the circumstances,

284
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:49,356
it's probably something that the culprit took away

285
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:50,856
after committing the crime.

286
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:52,856
Takagi, bring it, will you?

287
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:54,456
Yes, sir.

288
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:58,556
Why did Mr. Tsuge, already 3 months after the incident,

289
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:03,056
say that he would reveal who the killer of that incident was?

290
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:07,356
On the day of Kaoru's funeral, he could've revealed it

291
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:09,856
when he got into an argument with Mr. Sasamori, couldn't he?

292
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:11,656
That's true.

293
00:16:11,656 --> 00:16:14,556
Mr. Tsuge probably wanted to accuse the culprit

294
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,156
in his own unique way.

295
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:20,956
In order to do so, he needed 3 months.

296
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:22,756
Could that be...

297
00:16:22,756 --> 00:16:23,956
Right.

298
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:25,956
It's the time he needed to make that artifact

299
00:16:25,956 --> 00:16:28,456
that you see in front of you.

300
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:31,056
The title of that artifact is "demurrer".

301
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,056
It means "objection."

302
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:35,856
Mr. Mouri, here it is.

303
00:16:35,856 --> 00:16:37,656
I'm sorry, but can you put that in the place

304
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:40,156
where the vinyl tape is in the room?

305
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:41,956
Yes, sir.

306
00:16:41,956 --> 00:16:43,756
Try to remember.

307
00:16:43,756 --> 00:16:45,656
The name Hikaru Tsuge is

308
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:48,856
the anagram of his real name, Ritsu Hikage.

309
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:51,356
Hikari (Light) Tsuge and Ritsu Hikage (Shadow).

310
00:16:51,356 --> 00:16:53,456
Indeed "light" and "shadow".

311
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:55,956
And I tried figuring out the anagram for "demurrer",

312
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:58,756
the title of the artifact.

313
00:16:58,756 --> 00:17:02,556
A different title emerges...

314
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:03,956
"Murderer".

315
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:07,556
The hidden title "murderer".

316
00:17:07,556 --> 00:17:11,856
The hidden title "Murderer"?

317
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:14,756
It's ready.

318
00:17:14,756 --> 00:17:17,756
Ran, please lower the screen above the door

319
00:17:17,756 --> 00:17:19,356
and turn off the light of the room.

320
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:20,856
Okay.

321
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,456
Takagi, the light.

322
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:27,056
Yes, sir.

323
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:32,656
What about this is the murderer?

324
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:36,656
Takagi, turn the pedestal of the artifact slowly, will you?

325
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,156
Huh? Yes, sir.

326
00:17:42,556 --> 00:17:44,556
This is...

327
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:48,356
Shadow art.

328
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:50,856
At first glance, it's an artifact that's incomprehensible.

329
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:53,956
But if you shine the light on it from a certain angle,

330
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:55,856
a shadow art emerges from it.

331
00:17:55,856 --> 00:17:58,656
Through his art,

332
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:02,556
Mr. Tsuge was trying to accuse the culprit.

333
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:04,556
Ran, turn on the light.

334
00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:07,956
Ms. Kazumi Ishikura.

335
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:11,256
You're the one who killed Ms. Kaoru Sasamori

336
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,356
and Mr. Hikari Tsuge, aren't you?

337
00:18:14,356 --> 00:18:16,156
Hold it, Mr. Mouri.

338
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:18,356
I wonder if that silhouetted ballerina artifact

339
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:20,656
suffices to accuse her as the culprit.

340
00:18:20,656 --> 00:18:22,756
True, that the silhouetted picture alone

341
00:18:22,756 --> 00:18:24,856
may not suffice as evidence.

342
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:28,756
But the culprit afraid that the picture would be shown

343
00:18:28,756 --> 00:18:31,156
took the light away from the scene.

344
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:32,656
That move of hers,

345
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:36,456
serves as an immovable evidence that specifies her as the culprit.

346
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:38,156
Try to remember.

347
00:18:38,156 --> 00:18:39,856
In order to go to where the light was,

348
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:43,056
you would have to step over Mr. Tsuge's dead body.

349
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,556
However, on the other side, there was a pool of blood,

350
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:47,956
and you can't step on it.

351
00:18:47,956 --> 00:18:50,956
Because you'd be leaving footprints if you did.

352
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:53,156
In other words, the culprit, just as Conan did,

353
00:18:53,156 --> 00:18:54,856
at the time the body was found,

354
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:58,056
went under the work table and went over to the other side,

355
00:18:58,056 --> 00:19:00,656
and took the light away.

356
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:04,356
No offense but with the physique of Mr. Sasamori or Ms. Noguch,

357
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:07,856
it would be impossible to go under the work table.

358
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,156
The only one who can go through there

359
00:19:10,156 --> 00:19:14,656
is you, a ballerina, Ms. Ishikura.

360
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:16,656
Lastly, one more thing.

361
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,056
When you got off your car at the parking lot,

362
00:19:19,056 --> 00:19:22,556
you didn't have an umbrella and were soaking wet, weren't you?

363
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:24,656
However, from what Conan tells me,

364
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:29,056
the driver's seat of your car was also soaking wet.

365
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:30,056
In other words,

366
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:33,556
you were already drenched before you got off your car

367
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:37,256
because you went to get rid of that light stand in this rain.

368
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:43,556
We were supposed to get married.

369
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:46,756
At least, I thought so.

370
00:19:46,756 --> 00:19:49,356
That's why when I heard he invited you,

371
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,856
I thought he was going to announce that.

372
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:55,656
So, not being able to wait that long, I came here before all of you.

373
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:58,856
Tsuge had the nerve to show me his shadow art

374
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:01,856
and told me he was going to accuse me of murder.

375
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:03,456
What are you talking about?

376
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:06,356
Weren't you going to announce our engagement today?

377
00:20:06,356 --> 00:20:07,956
You said that if Kaoru disappeared,

378
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,556
you'd be able to marry me!

379
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:12,756
I said that on the spur of the moment

380
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:14,356
because I was fed up that she hired a detective

381
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:17,556
and was snooping around.

382
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:19,556
You were dumb enough to take it seriously.

383
00:20:19,556 --> 00:20:21,956
I had no idea that you would actually go through with it.

384
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:24,156
I mean, she was your best friend, you know.

385
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:31,856
Kaoru!

386
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,256
Are you all right, Kaoru?

387
00:20:34,256 --> 00:20:36,556
I really want out now.

388
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:42,456
I advise you to turn yourself in.

389
00:20:42,456 --> 00:20:44,756
I called a detective called Kogoro Mouri over

390
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:46,856
so that you could do so, too.

391
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:50,056
I'm sure he'll take you to the police.

392
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:52,756
If you need one, I can get you a good lawyer, too.

393
00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:13,856
But...

394
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,156
But, why didn't you destroy his artifact?

395
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:20,256
If you did, you wouldn't have had to hide the light.

396
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:24,256
It's not that she didn't destroy it.

397
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:26,356
She couldn't.

398
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:30,056
Right. I couldn't destroy it.

399
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:32,756
I was happy.

400
00:21:32,756 --> 00:21:36,756
Even if it were a piece that he made so that he could accuse me,

401
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:40,256
just to think that he thought about me for 3 months

402
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:43,856
while he was making this artifact,

403
00:21:43,856 --> 00:21:45,856
I just couldn't destroy it.

404
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:15,756
Hey, Dad!

405
00:23:15,756 --> 00:23:18,556
You're drinking too much beer!

406
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:20,756
Besides, why are the lights turned off?

407
00:23:20,756 --> 00:23:24,256
Shut up! Just wait and see.

408
00:23:24,256 --> 00:23:28,256
I'm going to show you my artistic shadow art from now.

409
00:23:30,056 --> 00:23:32,056
No joke!

410
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:35,456
Fantastic! It's Mom's profile!

411
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,756
It... It sure looks it.

412
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:41,256
Dad, you had artistic talent too, didn't you?

413
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:43,756
Sort of.

414
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,756
Call me "Art Kogoro" from now on!

415
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:53,156
Right. Kogoro Mouri Art... What a surprise.

416
00:23:53,156 --> 00:23:54,556
What the?

417
00:23:56,556 --> 00:23:58,856
"Next Episode" -Are you okay?

418
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:01,756
This is not a homicide.

419
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:04,456
Blood characters from 10 years ago...

420
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:07,656
that incident when Dad fled part way.

421
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:10,056
There's no need to call the ambulance.

422
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:13,856
It seems that more than 9 hours have passed since he died.

423
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:17,956
But this is not death by illness.

424
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,956
Somebody with ill intent did this.

425
00:24:20,956 --> 00:24:26,456
Next Conan, "Yusaku Kudo's Cold Case (Part 1)"

426
00:24:42,256 --> 00:24:44,656
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:44,656 --> 00:24:46,656
"Candy"

428
00:24:46,656 --> 00:24:48,956
-Dad's cold case, huh? -Who's Dad?

429
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:51,456
I meant "dandy". Dandy.
