1
00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:06,763
So, you like tennis?

2
00:00:06,763 --> 00:00:10,163
Oh, yes! It's quite thrilling!

3
00:00:10,163 --> 00:00:13,163
Thrilling you say? Lucky you.

4
00:00:13,163 --> 00:00:16,563
Well, you can expect a greater thrill soon.

5
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:18,863
What?

6
00:00:18,863 --> 00:00:22,763
A person is about to be murdered,

7
00:00:22,763 --> 00:00:25,463
somewhere in London...

8
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:28,063
Right before your eyes.

9
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,963
Tell Scotland Yard

10
00:00:31,963 --> 00:00:34,563
that's my revelation.

11
00:00:34,563 --> 00:00:39,963
If it doesn't make sense, go to Holmes.

12
00:00:41,463 --> 00:00:43,163
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

13
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:45,463
You must be true to yourself.

14
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:47,263
Conan Edogawa is cornered.

15
00:00:47,263 --> 00:00:49,263
Ran can't find out about this!

16
00:00:49,263 --> 00:00:50,963
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:52,863
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:52,863 --> 00:00:55,363
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,946
We end up going to London

20
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:39,946
because of a coincidental encounter with

21
00:02:39,946 --> 00:02:43,046
an English woman called Diana, who invites us over.

22
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:47,259
Of course I can't leave the country as Conan Edogawa,

23
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:49,059
so I returned to being Shinichi Kudo temporarily

24
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:51,859
using the drug that Ai gave me,

25
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:54,659
and headed for London separate from Ran and Pops.

26
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,159
The sanctuary of Sherlock Holmes, the one I adore.

27
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,759
I've got so many places I want to go to that I'm in a fix!

28
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,859
But, waiting for us there

29
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:10,859
was the premonition of a gravely serious crime.

30
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:15,359
Apollo, the little brother of a famous tennis player, Minerva Grass

31
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:16,359
was given a piece of paper with a mysterious code

32
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:18,459
written on it by a suspicious man.

33
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:21,759
Along with the words, "Someone will die right before your eyes"...

34
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:28,959
on the piece of paper were mysterious coded sentences.

35
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:33,859
"I will awake at the loud sound of the ringing bell."

36
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:37,759
"I'm a long nosed wizard that lives in a castle."

37
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,459
"I fill myself up with boiled eggs as cold as a corpse."

38
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:46,659
"All I need to do now is bite on a whole pickle."

39
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:51,159
"That's right, I have to order a cake for celebration."

40
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,659
"The sound of the bell stirs up hate in me."

41
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,459
"Finish everything off,"

42
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,159
"stab and pierce the white back with two swords."

43
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,859
What is the man trying to relay, anyway?

44
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,559
I went on behalf of Apollo

45
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:09,759
and delivered the piece of paper to Scotland Yard.

46
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,859
There we found out that a lot of other children

47
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:15,059
had also received the same coded sentences.

48
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:19,359
Somebody's going to die in front of all these children.

49
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,559
Don't tell me

50
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:23,859
this is a coded advanced warning of a massacre?

51
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:32,259
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Love is 0)"

52
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,059
The Great Britain Museum.

53
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,559
The Buckingham Palace.

54
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:51,159
Hyde Park.

55
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,959
Well...

56
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,359
We tried going to places where a crowd of people would gather, but...

57
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:02,959
There were no suspicious places.

58
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,959
There was no person passing out strange leaflets either.

59
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,459
Well, it was good that we could take a city tour of London, though.

60
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,259
Don't be silly!

61
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,859
I was concentrating on finding suspicious characters

62
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:17,259
that I didn't enjoy touring at all!

63
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:18,559
My God.

64
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:21,459
I'll go get us something to drink, so you wait here!

65
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:22,859
Okay.

66
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,659
A code...

67
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:31,359
I tried taking a picture of it with my cell phone too, but...

68
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,159
It's all Greek to me.

69
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:38,959
But I'm sure that Shinichi would be able to solve it.

70
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:42,559
I'd like to call him and ask him for advice,

71
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,159
but I wonder if I should.

72
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,759
What's with you, Shinichi, you punk!

73
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:52,059
I hung up on him after shouting at him.

74
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:53,759
But...

75
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,459
I guess it's understandable that he would be in a bad mood.

76
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:58,659
I'm sure it sounded like I was bragging

77
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,259
about coming to the land that he adores

78
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,559
all by myself without him.

79
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:05,559
How stupid of me.

80
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:07,759
To get carried away all by myself...

81
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,559
I went as far as to check something like this

82
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,259
on the net and made it, and yet...

83
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:16,959
I'm really... stupid.

84
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,959
Love hurts, doesn't it?

85
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,459
Doesn't it?

86
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,559
Well, no...

87
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,859
Yes, something like that.

88
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:38,659
You can't ask him for advice, then.

89
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:42,159
He's not an expert in that field, I'm afraid.

90
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:46,459
-Who is he? -Up there.

91
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,759
Sherlock Holmes!

92
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,959
I see!

93
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:00,259
I came back to Baker Street again without being aware.

94
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:03,059
Oh, you're Japanese?

95
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:05,659
Yes.

96
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:09,259
-Right. -How nostalgic, the Japanese language.

97
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:12,459
I used to live in Japan, too.

98
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:15,359
Because my mother underwent eye surgery in Japan,

99
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:19,159
and was hospitalized there for a while.

100
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:22,159
Are you by any chance...

101
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:24,559
Ms. Minerva Grass?

102
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:26,359
The tennis player!

103
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:27,559
If people start making a fuss,

104
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:30,459
I won't be able to come here anymore!

105
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,559
Do you come here often?

106
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,759
Yes.

107
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,759
For sure before competing in the Wimbledon finals.

108
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,759
In order to draw on Holmes' powers of observation

109
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,159
and discernment to lead me to victory.

110
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,359
You like Holmes, don't you?

111
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:53,659
Well, I guess I was strongly influenced by my mother.

112
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:57,459
My father is German, but my mother is English.

113
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:00,359
She's a Sherlockian through and through.

114
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:02,359
My mother lost her vision,

115
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:06,059
so now she can only read Conan Doyle in Braille, though.

116
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:07,859
And 8 years ago,

117
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:10,159
my father died in a traffic accident

118
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,859
along with my sister who was 6 years younger than me.

119
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:17,059
Minerva!

120
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:18,559
When my father died,

121
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:21,259
the one who was in my mother's stomach was Apollo, over there!

122
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:25,659
So, at present, I'm the breadwinner for the Grass family!

123
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:28,359
I thought he was still around here

124
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,359
because he hadn't called.

125
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,959
But he isn't.

126
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,559
Oh, that's too bad.

127
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,459
He really a disciple of Holmes!

128
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,359
Wait.

129
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:43,259
How did you know?

130
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:46,459
That I was troubled over love?

131
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:52,259
Because you had the same look on your face

132
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:56,959
that I saw in the mirror of myself some time ago.

133
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,259
Which means, that you're also troubled over love?

134
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:03,459
But I'm not troubled anymore.

135
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,259
Like Holmes also says,

136
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:08,059
love is an emotional thing.

137
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:12,959
It is does not go hand in hand with calm, logical thinking,

138
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,459
that I respect above all things.

139
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,959
You know, the same goes for tennis.

140
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,959
Love is 0 (Zero).

141
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,059
No matter how many zeros you accumulate,

142
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:26,159
the end result is miserable defeat.

143
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,459
Wrong!

144
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:36,959
This isn't the place!

145
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:39,459
This isn't it, either!

146
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,459
Darn it!

147
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:46,859
There is no place near a castle where there are two clock shops,

148
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:49,659
a food shop and cake shop,

149
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:52,159
along with a shop that sells weapons cluttered together!

150
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,159
Hey, hey. It's already 8:00 at night!

151
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,259
Just what're you talking about?

152
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:00,159
It's still this bright.

153
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,259
I see!

154
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:04,259
At this time of season, the vicinity of London

155
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:07,359
doesn't get dark until after 9:00 at night.

156
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:15,259
Ran, what's up?

157
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:17,559
What do you mean, what's up?

158
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,159
I told you that we were going to have dinner

159
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:22,859
at the hotel restaurant at 8:00, didn't I?

160
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:25,659
I'm sorry, Doc and I were absorbed

161
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,659
in trying to decipher the code, so...

162
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,959
We've already started eating, you know!

163
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,959
Then, Doc and I'll pass up the dinner.

164
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,559
We can go get some fish and chips around here.

165
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,759
Hey, hey.

166
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,859
Hey, where are you anyway?

167
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:42,559
I wonder where this is.

168
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,559
Isn't there any landmarks or something nearby?

169
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,659
Let's see...

170
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:50,359
There's a big Ferris Wheel right nearby!

171
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,859
The London Eye!

172
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,759
So, that's the story.

173
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,159
Wait...

174
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,359
London Eye, my foot!

175
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:06,459
We're near the Big Ben!

176
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:08,259
I had no choice, did I?

177
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:09,559
If she comes to get us,

178
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:12,859
we'll have to quit investigating on this dangerous code.

179
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:16,559
But I think Ran will be worried.

180
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,259
Don't worry! We'll be back at the hotel

181
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:20,959
about the time they finish having dinner!

182
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:25,759
May I be excused?

183
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,359
I'll call my company.

184
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:30,059
Oh, you will.

185
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:33,759
Wait here! I'll go get the two and bring them here!

186
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,159
What?

187
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,759
Hey!

188
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,959
Now, can I ask about your successful adventures?

189
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,059
Mr. Sleeping Detective.

190
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,859
What speaking now?

191
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:55,859
As you can see, I've brought a party of friends tonight.

192
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:59,759
Since I learned you're a famous detective in Japan...

193
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,259
Now, start your story, okay?

194
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:05,859
Okay.

195
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,359
The London Eye...

196
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:12,859
It's quite a distance away.

197
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:14,259
I've got no choice.

198
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:15,859
I'll run over there.

199
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:18,259
It's not far enough to take a cab besides.

200
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:22,259
I tell you, that Conan,

201
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:24,059
to be absorbed in making deductions

202
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:25,759
to the point of forgetting that he's hungry.

203
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,359
He just like...

204
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,859
He's just like...

205
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:33,859
Holmes said,

206
00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:37,459
that your brain works better on an empty stomach!

207
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,959
I guess I'll try calling Shinichi after all.

208
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,959
It really looks like an urgent code in need of deciphering.

209
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:53,559
But I just can't make myself call him.

210
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:56,959
But...

211
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,159
In other words,

212
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,259
a lot of people may be killed at once, right?

213
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:10,659
This code may not be

214
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:15,259
indicating a store that's selling things.

215
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:16,559
Yeah.

216
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,659
The first line says,

217
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:22,559
"I will awake with the sound of the bell ringing."

218
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,659
The next goes,

219
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:27,159
"I am a long nosed wizard that lives in a castle."

220
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:32,659
"I fill my stomach up with boiled eggs as cold as a corpse."

221
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:38,259
"All I have to do is bite on a whole pickle to finish it off."

222
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,759
"That's right, I've got to order a cake for celebration."

223
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:47,959
"The sound of the bell ringing stirs up hate in me."

224
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:53,059
And finally, it says, "Finish everything off.

225
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:56,659
Stab and pierce the white back with two swords."

226
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:59,659
It all sounds totally Greek to me.

227
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:02,459
If I can only decipher the first line

228
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:03,859
that reads, "The sound of the ringing bell",

229
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:05,959
then maybe it would serve as a clue.

230
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:12,159
It's Ran again.

231
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,459
Let me concentrate on the code.

232
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:16,759
Hello?

233
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,559
Sorry, Shinichi?

234
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,459
It's me.

235
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:24,659
Oh no! It's Shinichi's cell phone!

236
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,059
You were still sleeping, weren't you?

237
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:28,859
Since it's 5:00 in the morning yet in Japan, right?

238
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:31,359
No, I was awake.

239
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:33,159
I was thinking something over.

240
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,759
I'm sorry about a while ago

241
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,059
for shouting at you and hanging up the phone.

242
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:41,159
I'm here in the land that you always wanted to come to

243
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,559
and got carried away all by myself.

244
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,659
It sounded as if I was just bragging.

245
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:47,959
It didn't really bother me!

246
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,759
My hands were really tied back then.

247
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,759
I see. I'm sorry!

248
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,759
I have a code that I'd like you to decipher.

249
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:03,259
If it's that code, Conan the kid forwarded it to me.

250
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:06,559
The fact is, I stayed up all night thinking about that code.

251
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:13,059
But I'm stuck at the part, "The ringing bell..."

252
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:16,559
The ringing!

253
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,259
Sound of the bell.

254
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:39,343
I get it. It's Big Ben! Big Ben!

255
00:15:39,343 --> 00:15:42,343
-Huh? -You can hear it, can't you?

256
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:44,943
The chime of this Big Ben.

257
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:48,343
This is what the ringing sound of the bell is indicating!

258
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:50,543
This Big Ben...

259
00:15:52,343 --> 00:15:55,343
Hey, Shinichi, just what is the meaning of this?

260
00:15:55,343 --> 00:15:56,643
Well...

261
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:58,843
Don't tell me you're here? In London?

262
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:04,443
On TV, there's a live broadcast of London airing just now.

263
00:16:05,743 --> 00:16:07,543
You're here, aren't you?

264
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:11,243
Well, another call's coming in! See you then!

265
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:18,743
I see.

266
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:21,343
That's why he acted so indifferent

267
00:16:21,343 --> 00:16:22,443
and wanted to hang up right away acting as if

268
00:16:22,443 --> 00:16:24,943
I got him at the wrong time when I called him last.

269
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,643
It was because he's here in London!

270
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:36,943
Oh no! Ran's coming!

271
00:16:36,943 --> 00:16:42,043
Hey, we're supposed to be near the London Eye, you know?

272
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,343
At any rate...

273
00:16:45,343 --> 00:16:46,643
Let's get out of here.

274
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:48,843
I guess so!

275
00:16:55,143 --> 00:16:57,843
Well, that's the way I threw the culprit over

276
00:16:57,843 --> 00:17:00,043
using the Judo technique of one arm shoulder throw.

277
00:17:00,043 --> 00:17:01,843
Oh, baritsu!

278
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:05,743
Baritsu? No, no. Judo!

279
00:17:05,743 --> 00:17:07,643
That's baritsu.

280
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:10,843
Which Holmes performed on Professor Moriarty when they fell!

281
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:14,743
Mastering baritsu means you're a brilliant detective!

282
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:16,943
I don't know what's going on.

283
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:21,843
Oh, yes! I am strong detective!

284
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:28,343
I thought it was funny

285
00:17:28,343 --> 00:17:30,943
that Shinichi didn't sound envious!

286
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:32,943
I won't let him get away, never!

287
00:17:34,443 --> 00:17:36,143
Excuse me.

288
00:17:39,243 --> 00:17:42,043
Have you seen a Japanese boy?

289
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:43,543
Yes, I have!

290
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:47,543
I do believe he was rushing to the bridge over there.

291
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,643
No joke. You mean the bridge I just crossed?

292
00:17:51,643 --> 00:17:53,943
He crossed the other side on the opposite side.

293
00:17:58,643 --> 00:18:00,943
Shinichi!

294
00:18:02,943 --> 00:18:04,143
Oh no!

295
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:05,543
We've got to spend time somewhere

296
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,143
or she'll catch up with us!

297
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:09,343
Two Japanese together will stand out!

298
00:18:09,343 --> 00:18:11,343
Once we cross the bridge, let's split up and flee!

299
00:18:11,343 --> 00:18:13,343
I guess so!

300
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:18,543
Hey. Are you okay?

301
00:18:18,543 --> 00:18:20,743
That hurts.

302
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:24,043
The lid for this drain came off.

303
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:28,143
There're some words beside the drainage.

304
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:33,243
The Valley of Fear.

305
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:36,143
It's one of the titles of Holmes' story.

306
00:18:36,143 --> 00:18:38,743
Come on, hurry!

307
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,343
Yeah.

308
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:45,543
Why was it in a place like that?

309
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:55,643
Did you see a Japanese boy?

310
00:18:55,643 --> 00:18:58,543
Yes, I did. I saw him running over there!

311
00:19:01,743 --> 00:19:03,343
Excuse me!

312
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,543
Excuse me!

313
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:08,143
Excuse me!

314
00:19:09,143 --> 00:19:11,543
I just passed him.

315
00:19:13,643 --> 00:19:15,643
Excuse me!

316
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:18,943
Have you seen a Japanese boy?

317
00:19:18,943 --> 00:19:21,043
That boy has...

318
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:23,643
run into a phone booth just now.

319
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:26,943
Thanks.

320
00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:28,943
Oh no!

321
00:19:29,943 --> 00:19:31,543
If she finds me now,

322
00:19:31,543 --> 00:19:34,143
she'll find out that I'm Shinichi!

323
00:19:40,143 --> 00:19:42,843
Darn it! I've got no choice but to!

324
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:50,543
Shinichi.

325
00:19:50,543 --> 00:19:53,243
You can't run away from me anymore.

326
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:55,843
You'd better have a good explanation.

327
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:58,843
Shinichi!

328
00:20:22,343 --> 00:20:24,243
Explanation, nothing.

329
00:20:24,243 --> 00:20:27,243
It just so happened I came here to London too.

330
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,743
Hey, hey. Don't tell me you drank the antidote

331
00:20:30,743 --> 00:20:32,843
that you were going to drink upon departure?

332
00:20:34,343 --> 00:20:36,943
Then, why'd you run away?

333
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:39,243
That's well...

334
00:20:39,243 --> 00:20:43,543
I missed the chance to tell you about it,

335
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,943
so I felt sort of uncomfortable.

336
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:48,543
Why didn't you tell me?

337
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:51,243
You had a lot of chances to tell me, didn't you?

338
00:20:51,243 --> 00:20:52,843
So that's...

339
00:20:52,843 --> 00:20:55,043
So stupid.

340
00:20:55,043 --> 00:20:56,743
How stupid of me.

341
00:20:56,743 --> 00:21:00,043
Getting carried away all by myself.

342
00:21:00,043 --> 00:21:02,243
I checked on a lot of things

343
00:21:02,243 --> 00:21:04,543
and worried more than I could handle.

344
00:21:05,843 --> 00:21:08,043
I feel so stupid!

345
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,643
It's just like she said.

346
00:21:12,643 --> 00:21:14,543
Love is 0.

347
00:21:14,543 --> 00:21:15,943
No matter how many zeros you accumulate,

348
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,843
the result is miserable defeat.

349
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,343
Just what're you talking about?

350
00:21:20,343 --> 00:21:23,143
Minerva Grass said so!

351
00:21:23,143 --> 00:21:25,443
Minerva Grass, you mean...

352
00:21:25,443 --> 00:21:28,143
You met the Grass Queen?

353
00:21:28,143 --> 00:21:30,843
I met her! On Baker Street!

354
00:21:30,843 --> 00:21:31,943
Does it bug you?

355
00:21:31,943 --> 00:21:33,643
Baker Street?

356
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:36,643
Wasn't there a child nearby then?

357
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:37,943
Yes, there was.

358
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:40,243
She said he was her younger brother.

359
00:21:40,243 --> 00:21:42,943
He... Didn't that boy say anything?

360
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:45,643
Like, he remembered something so he came back?

361
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:49,843
Hey, cool head.

362
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:52,243
Cool head?

363
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:54,143
Don't you get it?

364
00:21:54,143 --> 00:21:56,643
You're a detective, aren't you?

365
00:21:56,643 --> 00:21:57,643
If you're a detective,

366
00:21:57,643 --> 00:22:00,043
why don't you deduce how I'm feeling inside?

367
00:22:00,043 --> 00:22:02,843
Idiot!

368
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:04,443
Hey, hold it!

369
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:05,543
Ran!

370
00:22:07,143 --> 00:22:08,543
I'm telling you, wait!

371
00:22:11,943 --> 00:22:13,243
Ran!

372
00:23:53,543 --> 00:23:56,043
"Next Episode" -Mazarin Stone.

373
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:58,043
Mazarin Stone.

374
00:23:58,043 --> 00:24:02,043
It seems that they came up with a suspect from fingerprints

375
00:24:02,043 --> 00:24:04,443
that were found on the piece of paper that the code was written on!

376
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,343
He seems to be exploding all the hospitals

377
00:24:06,343 --> 00:24:07,843
that refused to perform surgery on his mother.

378
00:24:07,843 --> 00:24:11,543
Explode... You mean by using bombs?

379
00:24:11,543 --> 00:24:13,243
Talking on the phone's getting us nowhere!

380
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,043
I'll be over right away!

381
00:24:15,043 --> 00:24:16,443
Huh?

382
00:24:17,943 --> 00:24:23,543
