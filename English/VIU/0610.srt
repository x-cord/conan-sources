"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:02,414 --> 00:00:04,414
Stay away!

3
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:10,091
Hey! Why is that dog glowing?

4
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:11,291
It's a demon dog!

5
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:13,491
Demon dogs really do exists!

6
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:15,291
It's just "phosphorus".

7
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:17,691
Phosphorus has the property

8
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:22,191
to emit a bluish-white glow upon exposure to oxygen, you know.

9
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:24,791
They just painted the dog with it to make it glow

10
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,991
and frighten people.

11
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:29,691
Geez, don't go spoil the ending for us like that.

12
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:32,491
But since Sherlock Holmes' "The Hound of the Baskervilles"

13
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,291
is so well known, I thought you knew that.

14
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,491
Now look here. Unlike Conan and Shinichi,

15
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:41,691
we aren't Sherlock Holmes' geeks.

16
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:44,391
Now that we know the demon dog's a fake,

17
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:46,691
I guess I'll watch another channel.

18
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:47,691
In that case,

19
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:50,491
how about joining us on a real demon dog hunt?

20
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:55,691
Hattori and Kazuha!

21
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:58,391
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

22
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,991
Tears are the start of all dramas.

23
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:02,891
The story with an unexpected twist.

24
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:04,891
Is the victim Shinichi Kudo?

25
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:06,491
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:08,391
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:11,091
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:54,573
"The Victim is Shinichi Kudo".

29
00:02:57,173 --> 00:03:00,773
"Mouri Detective Agency" -We did ring the bell,

30
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:04,073
but you didn't answer and we heard screaming.

31
00:03:04,073 --> 00:03:06,673
Also your front door was unlocked.

32
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:07,973
But even so,

33
00:03:07,973 --> 00:03:10,773
that's not a reason for you to just barge in like that.

34
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,573
Anyway, what did you mean when you said "demon dog"?

35
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:16,173
Oh, it's just a silly made-up story!

36
00:03:16,173 --> 00:03:18,173
Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that yet.

37
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:20,773
Do you know that about five years ago,

38
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:24,773
an extremely rich elderly man named Tsunechika Inubuchi passed away?

39
00:03:24,773 --> 00:03:26,073
Yeah.

40
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:30,373
Wasn't he the president of the Inubushi Group?

41
00:03:30,373 --> 00:03:33,273
Is it possible that this president was killed by the demon dog?

42
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:35,873
No, no. He just died of an illness.

43
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:37,473
He apparently had terminal cancer.

44
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:39,573
Nevertheless, about that president...

45
00:03:39,573 --> 00:03:41,073
It is said that he was wild

46
00:03:41,073 --> 00:03:43,773
and quite a ladies man when he was young.

47
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:45,773
In fact, in the days after he died,

48
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:48,373
his estate was visited by people claiming

49
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:52,673
"I am connected to the president by blood".

50
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:53,673
Illegitimate children?

51
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:56,273
Yes, and each one of them

52
00:03:56,273 --> 00:03:59,373
carried a picture of the president with their mother.

53
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:00,773
Geez.

54
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,173
Wouldn't something like that just be a lie in order to get inheritance?

55
00:04:03,173 --> 00:04:04,773
You're absolutely right.

56
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:06,173
But even if they wanted to confirm it,

57
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:08,273
the old man himself is already gone.

58
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:11,973
And since they each said that their own mother died as well,

59
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:14,373
they couldn't learn about the romance.

60
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:16,973
Normally, they'd be turned away at this point.

61
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:20,073
But the president's wife, Satomi,

62
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:24,473
accepted them all as her adopted children.

63
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,973
All eight of them!

64
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:27,573
Eight of them?

65
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:31,573
And now that the wife has been struck with illness,

66
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:34,273
the case begins.

67
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:35,973
Fight over inheritance...

68
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:36,973
Yeah.

69
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:40,273
The huge inheritance the wife received from the president,

70
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:41,873
which was to be divided

71
00:04:41,873 --> 00:04:45,273
amongst the eight adopted children upon her death.

72
00:04:45,273 --> 00:04:49,773
But two of the children have since died in bizarre ways.

73
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:52,073
One of them fell from a cliff

74
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:55,173
and just before dying said that

75
00:04:55,173 --> 00:04:59,673
what pushed him was a kind of monster,

76
00:04:59,673 --> 00:05:01,373
whose body was engulfed in crimson flames

77
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:04,073
that grew bigger and bigger as it attacked.

78
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:06,973
An apparition that strongly resembled a dog.

79
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,773
What?

80
00:05:10,473 --> 00:05:12,873
It was probably just someone who set a plastic doll on fire

81
00:05:12,873 --> 00:05:14,673
and closed in after him.

82
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:15,973
However,

83
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:20,673
that guy, he fled from the dog by bike for as far as one kilometre.

84
00:05:20,673 --> 00:05:22,673
He would've noticed it's a fake, wouldn't he?

85
00:05:22,673 --> 00:05:24,473
Then, were you, Heiji,

86
00:05:24,473 --> 00:05:27,373
contacted by that Inubushi family?

87
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:29,773
No, it happens that one of the adopted children

88
00:05:29,773 --> 00:05:32,473
is an acquaintance of Kazuha's mother.

89
00:05:32,473 --> 00:05:34,873
I heard that they were elementary schoolmates.

90
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:37,473
He said he used to live in Kansai (western part of Japan).

91
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:40,773
And he said the two people who died

92
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,373
were killed by a curse.

93
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:45,073
A... a curse?

94
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:47,673
According to him, one of the eight children

95
00:05:47,673 --> 00:05:51,773
is an imposter who holds a grudge against the Inubushi family.

96
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:53,673
And plans to use a cursed demon dog

97
00:05:53,673 --> 00:05:57,773
to root out all those with Inubushi blood!

98
00:05:57,773 --> 00:05:58,973
Root out?

99
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:02,973
In fact, it was my dad, the chief detective with the Osaka Police,

100
00:06:02,973 --> 00:06:05,373
who he really wanted to consult with.

101
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:07,573
But there's no way my dad can leave Osaka.

102
00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:08,573
Having no choice,

103
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:11,173
he asked if someone could at least come and listen to his story.

104
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:13,573
That's where I step in.

105
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,973
But all in all,

106
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:17,373
you still need to go to that Inubushi house, no?

107
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:20,973
Nah, it seems he gave up all claim to the inheritance

108
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:23,173
and left the Inubushi family.

109
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:25,773
He has since changed his name

110
00:06:25,773 --> 00:06:28,073
and lives here in Tokyo.

111
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:30,773
I'm going to go listen to his story tomorrow.

112
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:32,473
You guys want to come?

113
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:33,973
What?

114
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:37,973
Actually, that guy has a very funny name.

115
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:43,573
"Shinichi Kudo" -Shinichi Kudo?

116
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:44,973
No kidding.

117
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:47,473
See, isn't it hilarious?

118
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,373
Not funny.

119
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:52,273
Who may I ask is calling?

120
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:54,873
The detective who was summoned by Mr. Shinnichi Kudo.

121
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:58,473
That was a woman's voice just now, right?

122
00:06:58,473 --> 00:07:01,173
But doesn't that person live alone?

123
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:03,673
He has a bad back, so he has a helper

124
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,973
who comes to look after him two to three times a week.

125
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:09,173
It seems he can't even go to work at his company now.

126
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:13,373
"Funae Abukawa (39)" -Well...

127
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:15,773
"Homehelper" -Mr. Kudo is sleeping right now.

128
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,673
Mr. Kudo, you have visitors.

129
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,773
Sound asleep, huh?

130
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:31,873
But isn't this room a bit too warm?

131
00:07:31,873 --> 00:07:34,673
Yeah. He might have a slight cold.

132
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:38,373
"Shinichi Kudo (43)" -Also, he said he didn't sleep much at all last night

133
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:40,773
"Adopted heir of Inubushi" -because he stayed up doing a lot of thinking.

134
00:07:40,773 --> 00:07:43,673
But he should wake up soon.

135
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:44,773
Then, if you don't mind,

136
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:46,973
we'll wait here until he does.

137
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:52,873
I'd be grateful if you would listen to what he has to say.

138
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,473
I don't think I can handle it anymore.

139
00:07:57,973 --> 00:08:00,473
He'd rather die now and be at peace?

140
00:08:00,473 --> 00:08:02,373
Did he really say that?

141
00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:03,673
Yes.

142
00:08:03,673 --> 00:08:07,073
He said that if he were going to be eaten by accursed demon dog...

143
00:08:07,073 --> 00:08:08,873
That man may have seen it as well,

144
00:08:08,873 --> 00:08:10,773
I mean the dog.

145
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:12,073
I guess so.

146
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:17,073
All right now, I'm going to go buy groceries for dinner.

147
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:19,173
Could you two watch the house for me?

148
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:21,273
Sure, no problem.

149
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:25,473
A cursed demon dog, huh?

150
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:29,073
Hey, did you hear anything else about the case?

151
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:30,073
Yeah.

152
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:33,073
I heard about the names of those eight adopted children.

153
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:36,973
Well, the pronunciations are

154
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:41,773
Shinichi, Takako, Saki, Tomoaki,

155
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:46,073
Miwako, Yoshiya, Keiji and Miyuki.

156
00:08:46,073 --> 00:08:48,873
It seems they were all named

157
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:52,273
by president Tsunechika Inubushi who died five years ago.

158
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:55,673
And, who were the two people that died?

159
00:08:55,673 --> 00:08:58,173
Well, if I recall...

160
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:03,873
What's that sound?

161
00:09:03,873 --> 00:09:07,873
I think he may have set an alarm clock to play music.

162
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:14,473
This... this door...

163
00:09:14,473 --> 00:09:16,073
It's been sealed with packing tape!

164
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:30,173
-Suicide by charcoal poisoning? -Looks like it.

165
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:31,773
I'll take care of the taped window.

166
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:33,373
And I'll get the clay stove out.

167
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:42,373
Darn, this is stuck on really tight!

168
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,873
Didn't you say he had back pain?

169
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:47,373
Even made a kind of footstool out of a pile of books.

170
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,073
Wait a minute, this charcoal stove is...

171
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:55,773
What... what's going on here?

172
00:09:56,973 --> 00:09:58,773
It's carbon monoxide poisoning!

173
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:00,173
Don't move!

174
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:01,773
You can't come inside!

175
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:14,773
We first came to this room about 30 minutes ago, right?

176
00:10:14,773 --> 00:10:15,873
Yeah.

177
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:19,073
His jaw has started to stiffen.

178
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:23,073
His back is showing signs of slight rigor mortis.

179
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:26,573
And, this charcoal stove...

180
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:31,173
Not to mention that stack of books used as a footstool...

181
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:33,673
-It's obvious. -Yeah.

182
00:10:33,673 --> 00:10:37,873
Anyway, I should go and call the police.

183
00:10:37,873 --> 00:10:39,773
Before you do that,

184
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,773
we need to ask you something.

185
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:43,773
What?

186
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:46,573
Why did you kill that man?

187
00:10:48,173 --> 00:10:51,873
-Why? -That's our question.

188
00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:56,273
And if you're thinking of telling us it was the demon dog's curse...

189
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:58,373
You won't fool us.

190
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:05,443
Wait... wait just a moment!

191
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:08,043
Why would I be the culprit?

192
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,043
I'm just an ordinary homehelper.

193
00:11:10,043 --> 00:11:13,443
Anyway, I only just returned from shopping.

194
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:16,543
Plus, it looks as if this door

195
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,043
was sealed with masking tape.

196
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:20,543
And when I got here,

197
00:11:20,543 --> 00:11:23,843
you were tearing the masking tape off of the window, right?

198
00:11:23,843 --> 00:11:26,843
Yeah. It was stuck on there real good.

199
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:28,043
Not to mention

200
00:11:28,043 --> 00:11:31,143
the fact that a charcoal stove was next to the body.

201
00:11:31,143 --> 00:11:34,043
So, no matter how you look at it,

202
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:37,343
it must be suicide by charcoal poisoning!

203
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,743
That may be so.

204
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:41,643
Both the entry door and the window

205
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:44,043
were sealed from inside,

206
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:45,943
making it a perfectly sealed-room.

207
00:11:45,943 --> 00:11:50,643
And it'd be impossible for anyone else

208
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,443
to be in the room.

209
00:11:53,443 --> 00:11:55,043
In that case...

210
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:58,243
However, it is strange.

211
00:11:58,243 --> 00:12:00,943
Despite Shinichi having a bad back,

212
00:12:00,943 --> 00:12:02,443
there's a footstool made from books

213
00:12:02,443 --> 00:12:05,543
in the lower part of the shelf.

214
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:07,443
Do you think someone with a bad back

215
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:10,143
would've deliberately bent over

216
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:12,543
to take books from the lower shelf?

217
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:16,043
Perhaps the books on the shelves he could easily reach

218
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:19,143
were ones he didn't want to step on?

219
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:20,743
That's why he strained himself to.

220
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:22,243
Not to mention this charcoal stove...

221
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:25,043
It isn't hot even though I hold it in my bare hand.

222
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:27,043
You may not know this, little boy,

223
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:28,143
but charcoal is...

224
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:31,243
If you burn charcoal in an airtight room,

225
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:33,443
the oxygen in the air will be exhausted,

226
00:12:33,443 --> 00:12:35,643
causing incomplete combustion

227
00:12:35,643 --> 00:12:38,343
and carbon monoxide is generated.

228
00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:39,543
If inhaled,

229
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:42,143
carbon monoxide will introduce itself to the bloodstream,

230
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:44,943
combine with the haemoglobin and lead to asphyxiation

231
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:46,443
followed by death.

232
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:47,643
With that said,

233
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:50,243
did you want to say that when the oxygen was finally used up,

234
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:54,543
the flame on the charcoal went out?

235
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:56,543
Yeah.

236
00:12:56,543 --> 00:13:01,943
Well, it would've been extremely painful if it failed,

237
00:13:01,943 --> 00:13:04,443
followed by serious after-effects.

238
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:06,743
But it was about 30 minutes ago

239
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:10,143
that we last saw this man sleeping in this room.

240
00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:12,943
If he then sealed the door and the window,

241
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:15,443
wouldn't it take more than ten minutes?

242
00:13:15,443 --> 00:13:17,743
It would take even longer

243
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:19,643
if he took it slow with his bad back!

244
00:13:19,643 --> 00:13:21,543
It would take quite a while

245
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:24,643
for a single clay stove to fill the room with carbon monoxide

246
00:13:24,643 --> 00:13:28,743
and the remaining time wouldn't be sufficient.

247
00:13:28,743 --> 00:13:30,643
And even if the fire went out,

248
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,643
it should still retain some heat.

249
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:35,343
In short, this charcoal

250
00:13:35,343 --> 00:13:39,043
has already been burned and left cold for quite a while.

251
00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:43,243
And that means that

252
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:47,343
what was placed in the stove was just cold charcoal.

253
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:49,243
It also means that someone else could've been in this room

254
00:13:49,243 --> 00:13:52,743
to seal the windows and the door with masking tape.

255
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:57,543
Ridiculous! Are you saying I was in the room?

256
00:13:57,543 --> 00:14:00,343
If so, you would've seen me, wouldn't you?

257
00:14:00,343 --> 00:14:03,043
But I wasn't here.

258
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,743
You were holding your breath hiding, weren't you?

259
00:14:05,743 --> 00:14:08,543
In the space between this bookshelf and behind the door.

260
00:14:11,043 --> 00:14:13,243
It was a well-thought-out plan you made.

261
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:16,643
If we saw the door and the window all taped up

262
00:14:16,643 --> 00:14:18,243
and a charcoal stove on the floor,

263
00:14:18,243 --> 00:14:20,643
we'd think it was a charcoal-burning suicide.

264
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:22,243
And our attention would've been directed

265
00:14:22,243 --> 00:14:24,943
to those instead of to the door.

266
00:14:24,943 --> 00:14:28,243
Enabling you to safely hide behind the door.

267
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:31,543
And, just as we were about to remove the tape on the window

268
00:14:31,543 --> 00:14:34,643
and the stove from the room,

269
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:38,343
you took the chance to sneak out to the doorway.

270
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:40,243
You attempted to raise the room temperature

271
00:14:40,243 --> 00:14:43,543
in order to slow the body temperature's drop rate,

272
00:14:43,543 --> 00:14:45,643
but since his jaw has already begun to stiffen,

273
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:48,443
more than an hour would've passed since his death.

274
00:14:48,443 --> 00:14:51,243
His back also showed slight rigor mortis.

275
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:53,043
That's proof

276
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:55,243
that you laid the deceased old man on this bed

277
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:57,843
to make it appear as if he is sleeping.

278
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:00,443
Well, talk about evidence,

279
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:03,943
her fingerprints should still be on the duct tape, shouldn't they?

280
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:04,943
That's right.

281
00:15:04,943 --> 00:15:07,643
Since you had to apply a very sticky masking tape,

282
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:11,143
it would take more time if you had been wearing gloves.

283
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,843
I bet you planned on taking the tape down with us,

284
00:15:13,843 --> 00:15:15,343
and trying to trick us by saying

285
00:15:15,343 --> 00:15:18,043
that's how your prints got on the tape.

286
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,043
But your plan is ruined, isn't it?

287
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:22,143
What... what is this?

288
00:15:22,143 --> 00:15:24,943
Who on earth are you?

289
00:15:24,943 --> 00:15:28,543
Didn't we tell you when we rang the bell to this house?

290
00:15:29,943 --> 00:15:31,343
That we're detectives!

291
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:33,343
This... this is wrong.

292
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:34,843
This is not what I was told!

293
00:15:34,843 --> 00:15:36,043
What's that?

294
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:38,243
From what I heard

295
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:42,743
it was only a child detective who was coming.

296
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:44,943
"It was only a child, so it's no big deal."

297
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:47,443
Did this man tell you something like that?

298
00:15:49,143 --> 00:15:50,543
It's the culprit!

299
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:51,843
It was the culprit who said

300
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:54,343
that everything would be fine if I followed the instructions,

301
00:15:54,343 --> 00:15:56,843
because I'd be dealing with a child!

302
00:15:56,843 --> 00:15:58,343
What now?

303
00:15:58,343 --> 00:15:59,443
Look, lady.

304
00:15:59,443 --> 00:16:00,543
If you keep spewing nonsense,

305
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:01,543
I'll teach you a lesson!

306
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,943
I'm not lying!

307
00:16:02,943 --> 00:16:05,443
Because when I came here today,

308
00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:08,643
Mr. Kudo was already dead.

309
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:10,643
What do you mean?

310
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:13,443
I came in the afternoon as I usually do...

311
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:16,643
But when I rang the doorbell, no one answered.

312
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,743
I had no choice

313
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,843
but to enter using the spare key I was given,

314
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:22,843
and the phone had been ringing.

315
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:25,143
When I answered,

316
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:28,043
the caller told me in an eerie, machine-modified voice.

317
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:31,643
"I have shut Kudo up inside his bedroom wardrobe.

318
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:32,843
If you want to save him,

319
00:16:32,843 --> 00:16:35,943
you'd better hurry", they said.

320
00:16:35,943 --> 00:16:37,843
The wardrobe?

321
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:39,043
This thing.

322
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:42,643
I came to this room half-unconvinced.

323
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:45,743
The wardrobe had indeed been sealed up with masking tape.

324
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:47,943
And a bar had been shoved through the handles

325
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:50,843
so it couldn't be opened from inside.

326
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,643
Soon after I removed it and opened the door,

327
00:16:54,643 --> 00:16:57,243
I found Mr. Kudo was inside.

328
00:16:57,243 --> 00:16:59,543
The edges of the door are sticky.

329
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:00,643
Yeah.

330
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:02,243
It seems they drugged him to sleep

331
00:17:02,243 --> 00:17:05,343
and killed him by locking him up in there

332
00:17:05,343 --> 00:17:07,443
with the burning charcoal grill.

333
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,443
You... you understand, right?

334
00:17:09,443 --> 00:17:12,043
That what I'm saying is the truth.

335
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:17,143
Yeah, this was indeed the true scene of the crime.

336
00:17:17,143 --> 00:17:19,043
However,

337
00:17:19,043 --> 00:17:20,543
if that was true,

338
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:23,443
why didn't you call the police?

339
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,643
If you did something this unwise and were discovered,

340
00:17:25,643 --> 00:17:29,243
you knew that the consequences would be irreversible.

341
00:17:29,243 --> 00:17:31,943
Because...

342
00:17:31,943 --> 00:17:34,843
because of what was stuck to the inside of the wardrobe door!

343
00:17:34,843 --> 00:17:37,243
A picture of my son!

344
00:17:39,243 --> 00:17:41,543
He said over the phone that if I didn't do what I was told,

345
00:17:41,543 --> 00:17:44,143
my son would meet the same fate.

346
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:45,943
And you took them seriously?

347
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:47,843
Yeah, it seems that person

348
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:52,543
also knew that I often got into arguments with Mr. Kudo.

349
00:17:52,543 --> 00:17:54,343
And said that camouflaging it as a suicide

350
00:17:54,343 --> 00:17:56,443
would be to my benefit as well.

351
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:57,643
Argument?

352
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,943
Like over the meals I made...

353
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:03,143
Mr. Kudo was picky about his likes and dislikes.

354
00:18:03,143 --> 00:18:07,243
And I've often complained about it to my co-workers.

355
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:08,643
Speaking of meals,

356
00:18:08,643 --> 00:18:10,843
what were you planning on doing earlier?

357
00:18:10,843 --> 00:18:13,743
You said you were going to buy groceries for dinner,

358
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:15,243
but you didn't go, right?

359
00:18:16,343 --> 00:18:18,643
I usually come here straight

360
00:18:18,643 --> 00:18:20,443
from the supermarket with groceries.

361
00:18:20,443 --> 00:18:22,443
I was instructed to use those

362
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:25,143
to make it appear as if I had gone shopping.

363
00:18:25,143 --> 00:18:28,543
Then what were you planning to make tonight?

364
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:29,843
Boiled mackerel in soy sauce.

365
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,943
You mean Ms. Abukawa, the caretaker?

366
00:18:33,943 --> 00:18:36,043
She came here today at noon.

367
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:38,043
Well, she was persistent today as well,

368
00:18:38,043 --> 00:18:39,643
she's such a tough customer.

369
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:42,543
-Persistent? -About the sliced mackerel!

370
00:18:42,543 --> 00:18:45,243
A little of the red juice had collected inside of the pack,

371
00:18:45,243 --> 00:18:46,943
so she demanded a discount.

372
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:50,643
Even though the price had already been lowered.

373
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:53,843
Well, then, thank you very much.

374
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:56,843
Looks like what she said...

375
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:59,343
Might actually be the truth.

376
00:18:59,343 --> 00:19:00,543
If she did something as noticeable

377
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:03,443
as haggling over the price a fish at noon,

378
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:07,443
she couldn't use it as an alibi for later.

379
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:09,143
And what about the culprit,

380
00:19:09,143 --> 00:19:11,643
did they say anything in regards to who they are?

381
00:19:11,643 --> 00:19:13,743
Well...

382
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:17,343
A vengeful spirit?

383
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:21,343
Did your caller really identify themselves as that?

384
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:25,043
Yeah, after they muttered that, the line went dead.

385
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:27,343
Do you have any clues about it?

386
00:19:27,343 --> 00:19:30,343
Such as someone holds a grudge against the victim.

387
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:32,043
Yeah, actually...

388
00:19:32,043 --> 00:19:34,143
Actually, the victim was

389
00:19:34,143 --> 00:19:37,443
an adopted son of the Inubushi Group president, Tsunichika,

390
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,743
who died five years ago.

391
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:42,343
And it seems he's been frightened about it lately.

392
00:19:42,343 --> 00:19:45,443
He said that a bad person had infiltrated the Inubushi family

393
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:46,943
and was intent on rooting out

394
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:49,643
everyone with Inubushi blood using a cursed demon dog.

395
00:19:49,643 --> 00:19:52,143
Demon dog?

396
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:55,943
It sounds like a story from a mystery novel.

397
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:59,543
There was a Sherlock Holmes story like that, wasn't there?

398
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:01,243
Wasn't that The Inugami Clan?

399
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,043
And, didn't you hear anything from the victim?

400
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:08,543
Did he have any appointments to see somebody recently?

401
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:10,543
I only heard that

402
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,743
a young boy detective from Osaka was coming.

403
00:20:13,743 --> 00:20:16,943
Since the culprit also knew of this,

404
00:20:16,943 --> 00:20:19,643
it means that this was definitely a crime by an acquaintance.

405
00:20:19,643 --> 00:20:20,943
Yeah,

406
00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:25,943
perhaps he was intending to go out somewhere with that culprit.

407
00:20:25,943 --> 00:20:28,343
Why would you say that?

408
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:31,143
When I found him inside the wardrobe,

409
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:33,743
he was wearing a business suit and necktie.

410
00:20:33,743 --> 00:20:35,343
Business suit?

411
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:36,743
And necktie?

412
00:20:36,743 --> 00:20:39,043
So you removed those

413
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:41,843
and put him in a jersey like that, right?

414
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:45,143
Yes, the culprit ordered me to do so.

415
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:48,143
Then you laid the body on the bed

416
00:20:48,143 --> 00:20:50,743
and waited for the child detective to come.

417
00:20:50,743 --> 00:20:54,143
And after you showed the victim to him as if he was sleeping,

418
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,143
you said that you were going shopping

419
00:20:55,143 --> 00:20:56,643
but actually entered the bedroom,

420
00:20:56,643 --> 00:20:58,743
where you moved the body to the floor

421
00:20:58,743 --> 00:21:00,343
and placed the charcoal grill,

422
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,743
and taped up the window and the door.

423
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:06,043
Finally, you pressed the CD's play button,

424
00:21:06,043 --> 00:21:09,843
and hid yourself in a position that would become a blind spot.

425
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:12,043
After that, when Hattori's group came in

426
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:14,443
after being surprised by the CD music,

427
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:17,943
they'd focus on the window, the body and the grill

428
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,443
and enabling you to leave the blind spot

429
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:21,143
and move to the doorway.

430
00:21:21,143 --> 00:21:24,343
Then you proceeded to pretend that you had just returned from shopping

431
00:21:24,343 --> 00:21:27,943
all by order of this culprit, is that correct?

432
00:21:27,943 --> 00:21:30,343
Yes, I'm sorry.

433
00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:33,843
By the way, can you tell me if anything was stolen?

434
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:38,543
Well, not sure. Only Mr. Kudo himself would know the answer...

435
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:40,343
But...

436
00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:44,043
The ornament attached to his necktie pin was removed.

437
00:21:44,043 --> 00:21:45,743
A necktie pin?

438
00:21:45,743 --> 00:21:48,543
Was there an expensive jewel attached earlier?

439
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:49,843
No.

440
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,043
I only noticed that there were signs

441
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,643
of something having been removed from it.

442
00:21:54,643 --> 00:21:56,543
As far as what that was, I have no idea.

443
00:21:56,543 --> 00:22:00,843
I almost never see Mr. Kudo in a business suit, so...

444
00:22:00,843 --> 00:22:03,043
Turn him face-up and put him on the stretcher!

445
00:22:03,043 --> 00:22:06,143
-Okay. -Ready, and... go!

446
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,543
Something fell out of his mouth!

447
00:22:12,543 --> 00:22:13,943
It was small and round.

448
00:22:17,743 --> 00:22:18,943
-A pearl? -A pearl?

449
00:22:18,943 --> 00:22:21,643
Hey, have that necktie pin checked right now!

450
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:26,243
Because if this poor man's saliva is found on it...

451
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:28,243
The fact that he bit this pearl away

452
00:22:28,243 --> 00:22:31,443
from his own necktie pin during his final moments

453
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:34,043
could be his dying message to us!

454
00:23:58,043 --> 00:24:00,443
"Next Episode" -Put it on fire?

455
00:24:00,443 --> 00:24:02,843
The ancestor of this house did? The dog on fire?

456
00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:05,943
Then, does the tomb really exist?

457
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:08,443
It says, "Here lies Fusataro".

458
00:24:08,443 --> 00:24:10,843
Just above this tomb.

459
00:24:13,043 --> 00:24:15,143
Sa... Saki?

460
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:18,343
It's just like a trace a dog in a ball of fire ran through.

461
00:24:18,343 --> 00:24:20,243
A cursed demon dog could be...

462
00:24:20,243 --> 00:24:22,343
It could be a true story?

463
00:24:22,343 --> 00:24:23,643
Next Conan,

464
00:24:23,643 --> 00:24:27,643
"Inubushi Family, The Ablazed Demon Dog (Will-O'-the Wisp Chapter)".

465
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:46,143
Next Conan's Hint:

466
00:24:46,143 --> 00:24:48,443
"Spheres".

467
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:52,043
We have another big case that reeks of a bad smell next time!
