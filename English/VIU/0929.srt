1
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:25,252
It hurts...

2
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:27,652
Don't...

3
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,452
Don't touch it.

4
00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:32,652
But it's just a little scrape.

5
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:36,452
We should put some medicine on it.

6
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:38,152
My apartment is nearby.

7
00:00:38,152 --> 00:00:40,152
But...

8
00:00:40,152 --> 00:00:43,052
Children shouldn't be so reserved.

9
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:51,252
"Saki Midorikawa"

10
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,852
Give me a minute.

11
00:00:57,552 --> 00:00:59,052
Let's see...

12
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:07,552
Oh, there it is.

13
00:01:10,552 --> 00:01:12,152
Let me see it.

14
00:01:12,152 --> 00:01:14,752
First we'll disinfect it.

15
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,352
This will sting a little.

16
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:21,152
Be strong.

17
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:25,752
Good girl.

18
00:01:26,952 --> 00:01:28,452
Okay, good.

19
00:01:28,452 --> 00:01:30,452
Thanks, miss.

20
00:01:30,452 --> 00:01:31,952
Want something to drink?

21
00:01:31,952 --> 00:01:34,352
All I have is tea and orange juice.

22
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:36,852
Oh, but...

23
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:39,652
Orange juice then.

24
00:01:39,652 --> 00:01:41,552
Orange juice it is.

25
00:01:47,352 --> 00:01:48,652
Here you go.

26
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:50,352
Thanks for the drink!

27
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,452
She's so pretty and nice.

28
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:12,152
Miss.

29
00:02:12,152 --> 00:02:14,052
You have a boyfriend.

30
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:19,252
Huh?

31
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:25,452
So they have a friend over.

32
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:31,452
A friend?

33
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:34,452
Nothing.

34
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:41,252
She saw me!

35
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,852
In my eyes are maximum creation.

36
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:47,552
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

37
00:02:47,552 --> 00:02:49,152
A dark shadow lurks in a beautiful woman's eyes!

38
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:51,252
It's a strange case connected to her window!

39
00:02:51,252 --> 00:02:52,752
He sees through the one and only truth.

40
00:02:52,752 --> 00:02:54,552
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

41
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:57,152
His name is Detective Conan!

42
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:43,541
"The Woman Standing by the Window (Part 1)"

43
00:04:47,941 --> 00:04:49,541
We're really going?

44
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,541
Yes! Don't you want to see her too?

45
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,541
She's pretty and nice.

46
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,341
Why not? Just imagine it's good for your eyes.

47
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:59,341
You too?

48
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:04,241
That's Saki Midorikawa.

49
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:07,941
She really is pretty.

50
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,741
Yeah.

51
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:12,641
I heard she was good-natured and cheerful, but...

52
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:15,741
She seems kind of lonely.

53
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:17,941
And what's she looking at?

54
00:05:21,141 --> 00:05:24,041
Come to think of it, she was looking yesterday too.

55
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,241
"Saki Midorikawa (28)"

56
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:35,341
You go to the gym?

57
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:37,541
For your beauty and health?

58
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,741
No. My body's important for work.

59
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,141
What's your job?

60
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:45,141
What do you think?

61
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:48,441
What were you looking at from your window?

62
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:50,841
What? Who knows?

63
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:53,241
This is my stop. See you later.

64
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:58,441
She's mysterious.

65
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,941
Kind of, yeah.

66
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:02,441
What's wrong with being mysterious?

67
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,741
Yeah!

68
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:06,341
Let's start looking for cases!

69
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:07,541
Since our long weekend starts today,

70
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,541
I'd like to solve a big case.

71
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:14,041
You really think you'll find a big case just lying around?

72
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:23,541
What's wrong with that car?

73
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,941
It's out of control!

74
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:37,441
Excuse me.

75
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,541
What's going on?

76
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:45,641
It's her.

77
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,041
"Tatsuko Dojima (43), Social Critic"

78
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:02,041
"Junnosuke Tachibana (33), Women's University Professor"

79
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,941
"Michiyo Konno (24), Office Worker"

80
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:08,841
-Is something wrong? -Is something wrong?

81
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:15,841
Let's see...

82
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:17,941
What a terrible accident.

83
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:19,841
Ms. Dojima.

84
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:23,041
I was so surprised by the loud noise.

85
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:26,241
Well, we'd only get in the way here.

86
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,641
You're right.

87
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:30,541
Let's go.

88
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:34,041
They were glaring at the nice lady.

89
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,341
I wonder what that was about.

90
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:38,641
You're here too?

91
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:42,441
Ms. Saki, have you done anything

92
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:44,241
to make people resent you?

93
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:52,341
Well, when you live twenty and some years...

94
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:54,941
Do you have some idea?

95
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,441
I'm kidding.

96
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:59,941
I haven't done anything like that.

97
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:03,641
Oh, no. I need to get to work.

98
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,341
Later.

99
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:09,841
Work?

100
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:11,641
I wonder what she does.

101
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:18,141
Hey.

102
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:20,841
Did something happen between you and that lady?

103
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:22,041
What?

104
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,241
No.

105
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:25,641
I have no idea what you mean.

106
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:31,841
All three of them were startled.

107
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:34,241
And they tried to play it off by smiling.

108
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:36,941
Something must be up.

109
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:40,541
But I don't see how anyone could hate the nice lady.

110
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:45,541
It's possible she incurred their hatred without realizing it.

111
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,641
You're right! Like a misunder-handstand.

112
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,441
You mean a misunderstanding?

113
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:52,841
Let's check it out.

114
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:01,141
I wonder who they are.

115
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:05,141
Seems like all three of them live here.

116
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:23,041
Hey. Excuse me.

117
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,541
"Kyoichi Ogi (58), Apartment Manager" -Huh?

118
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:28,541
What do those three people do?

119
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:32,341
Professor Junnosuke Tachibana of unit 102

120
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:35,741
is an English literature professor at Beika Women's University.

121
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,941
Good morning!

122
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:47,041
I told you not to come to my apartment. Right?

123
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:51,041
I'm jealous, Professor Tachibana.

124
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,641
He's so popular with his students

125
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:55,641
because he's handsome.

126
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:01,841
Good morning.

127
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:03,641
See you later.

128
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:10,541
Ms. Michiyo Konno of unit 302 works at a trading firm.

129
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,841
She's nothing if not earnest and polite.

130
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:15,441
She's a good girl.

131
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:21,241
Ms. Tatsuko Dojima of unit 1107 is a social critic.

132
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:23,841
An information program on TV?

133
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:25,441
That's right.

134
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:29,041
They're going to have me on as a regular commentator.

135
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,141
Someone finally realized my talent.

136
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:34,541
Took them long enough!

137
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:40,041
Now the entire country will know your name and face.

138
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,841
Well, yeah.

139
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:53,341
Well, I'm sure she's capable.

140
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:57,241
Mr. Junnosuke Tachibana of unit 102.

141
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:00,441
Ms. Michiyo Konno of unit 302.

142
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:04,141
Ms. Tatsuko Dojima of unit 1107.

143
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:07,841
A college professor, a serious office worker,

144
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:10,941
and a social critic asked to appear on TV.

145
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:13,641
They all sound like decent people.

146
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,141
No one strange lives here.

147
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:21,841
I guess we were worried for nothing.

148
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:23,141
That's good.

149
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,541
I hope you're right.

150
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:28,141
The water has stopped.

151
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:31,241
Let's keep looking for a case!

152
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:34,841
There must be something about those three.

153
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,941
Huh?

154
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:46,541
What's wrong?

155
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,941
Of course.

156
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:02,641
Then naturally, from here...

157
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:04,041
You can see them.

158
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,441
Yeah.

159
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:07,541
You can't see unit 1107

160
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,841
but you can see unit 102 and unit 302.

161
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:13,141
That's Professor Tachibana and Konno the office worker.

162
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:14,741
If we can see them from here,

163
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:17,041
then they must be visible from her apartment too.

164
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,441
Maybe she was looking out her window

165
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:26,441
and saw them doing something.

166
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:30,841
Something they didn't want her to see.

167
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:34,941
Ms. Saki herself probably hasn't realized what she saw.

168
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:36,341
It's possible she does know

169
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:38,841
and she's just playing dumb.

170
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,841
What? Why would she do that?

171
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:45,941
I'm just speaking hypothetically.

172
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:48,141
"Mr. Tachibana"

173
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:51,141
So she was watching.

174
00:12:51,141 --> 00:12:54,241
She was watching after all.

175
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:55,741
"I saw it all. I'll tell. If you don't want me to tell,"

176
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,541
"you'll have to pay me. Don't bother contacting the police."

177
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,341
"I saw it all."

178
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:01,141
"If you don't want me to tell..."

179
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:04,241
"The woman who knows your secret."

180
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:06,941
I wonder what she saw.

181
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:10,541
We're going to ask her that right now.

182
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,141
It's not clear if Ms. Saki herself is aware of what she saw.

183
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:17,841
I sure hope none of them resent her over a misunderstanding.

184
00:13:17,841 --> 00:13:20,841
She saw something they didn't want her to see...

185
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,141
That voice!

186
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:39,641
Wasn't that her?

187
00:13:50,107 --> 00:13:51,807
Miss!

188
00:13:51,807 --> 00:13:53,207
What happened?

189
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,607
A car...

190
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:56,407
A car crashed into you?

191
00:13:56,407 --> 00:13:59,007
No, I was thinking

192
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:01,707
and accidentally tried to cross when it was red.

193
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,607
And a car nearly hit you.

194
00:14:04,607 --> 00:14:06,607
You should be careful.

195
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:08,407
You're right.

196
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:12,107
We thought you were attacked over a misunderstanding.

197
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:13,307
What?

198
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:16,807
Ms. Saki, there's something we want to ask you.

199
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:19,907
Sorry but my heart's still pounding.

200
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:21,907
Ask me another time.

201
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:33,107
She seems pretty shocked over nearly being in an accident.

202
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:37,507
Then let's go ask them what she saw.

203
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:40,007
There's no way they'd tell us.

204
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:42,207
Let's take our chances.

205
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:43,807
You heard them.

206
00:14:46,307 --> 00:14:50,707
I understand Professor Tachibana and Ms. Michiyo Konno,

207
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:53,907
but what about Ms. Tatsuko Dojima?

208
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:58,607
Unit 1107 isn't visible from Ms. Saki's apartment.

209
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,407
There's no guarantee she saw it from her apartment.

210
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:05,907
I see. It's possible she witnessed whatever it was from somewhere else.

211
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:09,207
I wonder what she saw, though.

212
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:11,107
For example...

213
00:15:11,107 --> 00:15:13,307
maybe she shoplifted something

214
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:15,807
or cursed someone

215
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:17,907
or killed someone!

216
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:21,107
I'm sure she'd call the police immediately

217
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:23,107
if she saw that.

218
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:24,607
Normally, yeah.

219
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:28,007
In any case, we'll know once we ask them.

220
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:34,707
All three of them are out right now?

221
00:15:34,707 --> 00:15:37,007
We can't take any chances if they're out.

222
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:39,307
Let's wait for them to return.

223
00:15:39,307 --> 00:15:41,107
Wait?

224
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:47,307
Hello.

225
00:15:47,307 --> 00:15:49,207
Oh, from this afternoon...

226
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:52,707
We're actually the Youth Detective Squad.

227
00:15:52,707 --> 00:15:54,107
That woman from this afternoon

228
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:57,007
saw you doing something you shouldn't have, didn't she?

229
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:03,707
Like what?

230
00:16:03,707 --> 00:16:07,307
We were hoping you'd tell us.

231
00:16:10,307 --> 00:16:13,107
Why would she have seen something like that?

232
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:16,307
You were glaring at her, right?

233
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:20,807
That's because she seemed like a pretty, cheerful person.

234
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:22,307
What?

235
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:23,907
I was jealous.

236
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:27,207
I'm not pretty

237
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:29,007
and I'm gloomy.

238
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:31,507
So that's why?

239
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:37,607
I definitely glared at her.

240
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:41,507
Is it because she saw you doing something bad?

241
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:44,307
Because she looked like the cousin

242
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:47,607
I've hated since I was a child.

243
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,507
So that's why?

244
00:16:53,907 --> 00:16:55,207
Huh?

245
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:03,607
Yeah, she looked like her.

246
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,207
The girl who rejected me amidst a flurry of falling leaves

247
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:07,907
behind the school building one autumn day

248
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:10,407
during my second year of middle school!

249
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:13,607
Oh, it aches. The old wound aches.

250
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:15,407
Like the falling maple leaves,

251
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:18,507
so does my heart bleed!

252
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:20,607
Farewell, children.

253
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,307
I am...

254
00:17:34,507 --> 00:17:35,907
Once we got to know them,

255
00:17:35,907 --> 00:17:38,807
not a single one of them was decent.

256
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:47,607
In other words, you imagined all of it, Conan.

257
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:49,407
Yeah.

258
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:53,307
Hey, wait! You guys were worried too, right?

259
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,907
You're ignoring me?

260
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:57,707
I'm glad though.

261
00:17:57,707 --> 00:18:01,907
It had nothing to do with Ms. Saki.

262
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:04,007
Let's go home.

263

Good night.

266
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:00,507
Welcome.

267
00:19:04,907 --> 00:19:06,507
Thank you.

268
00:20:15,307 --> 00:20:19,107
It's their fault for allowing themselves to be blackmailed.

269
00:20:30,507 --> 00:20:31,707
Right?

270
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:40,707
No one's going to kill me.

271
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,907
-See you later. -See you later.

272
00:21:05,707 --> 00:21:07,307
Good morning.

273
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:10,007
Good morning.

274
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:17,207
Ms. Dojima, did you find what you were looking for?

275
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:21,807
No. I thought I dropped it around here.

276
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:50,807
She suddenly fell from up there!

277
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:53,107
Miss, pull yourself together.

278
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:55,507
I called the police.

279
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:03,907
Was there an accident?

280
00:22:09,207 --> 00:22:10,407
Miss!

281
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:13,007
She's dead?

282
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:15,207
No way... What's going on?

283
00:22:16,307 --> 00:22:19,007
What happened?

284
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:44,207
"Next Episode" -There were scratch marks

285
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:45,807
on the railing on the roof.

286
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:49,007
We also found a woman's earring on the ground.

287
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:52,007
But who and why?

288
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:55,607
A car almost struck Ms. Saki at an intersection yesterday.

289
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:59,407
I thought I saw him from my window.

290
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:01,607
There's only signs of water on this side.

291
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:06,407
She didn't come to the roof.

292
