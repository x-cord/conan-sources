1
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:05,109
We leave on Dr. Agasa's car to go camping,

2
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:08,709
but we run out of gas and are stalled.

3
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,909
We seek help from Mr. Goki Sudo

4
00:00:10,909 --> 00:00:13,509
who happens to pass by in a classic car,

5
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:16,409
but he makes a rude remark and goes off.

6
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:21,309
Soon afterwards,

7
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:23,709
an explosion occurs at the villa at the top of the mountain.

8
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:26,609
When I ran over there,

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,809
I saw Mr. Sudo's classic car up in flames

10
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:32,609
and his fiance, Ena Ginbayashi, shouting his name

11
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,909
and breaking out in tears.

12
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:38,209
At first, it looked to be a very unfortunate accident.

13
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:40,709
But I was suspicious of Ena's attitude.

14
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,409
Could it be a murder that Ena set up?

15
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:51,009
No igniting device was found at the site,

16
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,609
but there's got to be something!

17
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:56,709
A trick that can be used

18
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:59,509
to set the garage on fire without using an igniting device.

19
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,909
A catch-22 crisis is gracefully revived.

20
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:05,409
The table is turned and the mystery solved!

21
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:07,009
An explosion occurs where there is nothing to start a fire.

22
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:09,109
The secret behind a trick filled with hate.

23
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:10,809
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:12,809
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:14,609
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

26
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:52,677
"Blue Sparks of Hate (Part 2)".

27
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:05,274
Then, well, leaving the cigarettes aside.

28
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:07,774
"Ena Ginbayashi (31), Sudo's fiance" -Let's hear where and what

29
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:11,574
all of you were doing when Mr. Sudo came to this villa?

30
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:13,374
What?

31
00:03:13,374 --> 00:03:16,874
We were all gathered in the room playing a game.

32
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:18,074
Game?

33
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:20,374
King game!

34
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:21,574
You don't know that game?

35
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:24,774
You make pieces of paper with the seal of a King and a number on it.

36
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:27,174
The person who draws the paper with the King on it

37
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:30,874
has certain commands written on it like "number 13 kiss number 4".

38
00:03:30,874 --> 00:03:34,274
Was there anyone that wasn't in this room

39
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:36,674
when Mr. Sudo came here?

40
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,274
I think everybody was here.

41
00:03:38,274 --> 00:03:39,874
If anyone went to the restroom,

42
00:03:39,874 --> 00:03:41,274
we stopped the game

43
00:03:41,274 --> 00:03:43,674
and waited for that person to come back.

44
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:47,174
But if the owner of the house Mr. Sudo got here,

45
00:03:47,174 --> 00:03:50,174
it's only natural that someone would go out to greet him, right?

46
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:53,474
No, we didn't realize that he came back.

47
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:57,474
The garage door opens by remote controller from inside the car.

48
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:00,574
We had the BGM on pretty loud too.

49
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,074
Then we heard a big boom

50
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:05,074
and went to look outside.

51
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:07,274
And found that the garage was on fire.

52
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:11,574
Which means that even if there were to be an igniting device,

53
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:13,974
nobody could've operated it

54
00:04:13,974 --> 00:04:17,374
or calculate the timing to set it off?

55
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:18,374
No.

56
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:19,874
Not possible.

57
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:25,074
But why was the poly tank so unfortunately knocked over?

58
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:27,774
I think it was him.

59
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:32,374
This golden retriever that my late father bought for me.

60
00:04:32,374 --> 00:04:33,574
She so mischievous

61
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,274
and has a habit of knocking things over.

62
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:40,974
That's why I told him not to store gasoline in a poly tank.

63
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:45,874
But I didn't think that the same thing would happen three times.

64
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:47,374
Did something like this happen before too?

65
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:51,674
Yeah, we had a party last week and the previous week too,

66
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:53,074
but when Sudo came,

67
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:55,274
the poly tank was knocked over.

68
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:59,474
He was really angry saying, "Who the hell did this?"

69
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:01,974
After he found out that Ena's dog did it,

70
00:05:01,974 --> 00:05:03,774
he got in a big fight with Ena too.

71
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:09,774
They fought over everything from Sudo's car, to clothes...

72
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:12,374
So, the party was finished right then and there.

73
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:13,874
Was that two weeks ago?

74
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:16,374
Yes, last week

75
00:05:16,374 --> 00:05:20,074
I think they fought over Sudo stopping by somewhere before coming here.

76
00:05:20,074 --> 00:05:22,574
Who cares about something like that already!

77
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:23,874
Sorry.

78
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:28,574
He died because

79
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:33,074
he didn't listen to me.

80
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:39,374
It all adds up to that's only how much he cared for me.

81
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:42,174
That's all there is to it.

82
00:05:43,774 --> 00:05:44,874
There!

83
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:48,874
It's a tank of gasoline I had one of the men bring.

84
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:50,474
Thanks so much!

85
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:52,874
So, if there's anything more I want to ask you,

86
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,274
I'll call you.

87
00:05:54,274 --> 00:05:55,374
Okay.

88
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:59,674
That boy wearing glasses is nowhere around.

89
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:01,374
He's over there!

90
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:04,774
Please tell me!

91
00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:08,274
About the fight the two had last week and the week before!

92
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:10,974
I mean, talk about persistent! I already told you!

93
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:13,974
The week before last they got into a fight over the car and clothes.

94
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,574
But what made them fight over something like that?

95
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:19,274
Beats me,

96
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:22,474
probably because Ena told Sudo to come with his classic car,

97
00:06:22,474 --> 00:06:25,674
but he showed up with a new model car?

98
00:06:25,674 --> 00:06:28,274
Or, maybe because Goki didn't come to the party

99
00:06:28,274 --> 00:06:31,074
with the clothes that Ena bought for him just for the party?

100
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:32,974
What kind of clothes was it?

101
00:06:32,974 --> 00:06:34,674
What kind?

102
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:37,874
Remember, when you ran into Goki a while ago,

103
00:06:37,874 --> 00:06:39,674
I think he was wearing it too,

104
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:42,374
a white wool sweater and a fleece jacket.

105
00:06:42,374 --> 00:06:45,574
The sweater's the one that Ena bought for him.

106
00:06:45,574 --> 00:06:48,274
Sudo wore the fleece ever since he established his company,

107
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,374
because he really liked it,

108
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:53,274
but he didn't like wool.

109
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:54,774
But last week,

110
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:56,974
when he came here, he was wearing the wool sweater, right?

111
00:06:56,974 --> 00:06:58,874
He was also riding the classic car.

112
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:03,474
But when she saw that Goki was holding a PET bottle of mineral water.

113
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:06,174
Ena got angry saying,

114
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:08,674
"How dare you dilly-dally at a convenience store

115
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:10,874
despite knowing everyone is waiting!"

116
00:07:10,874 --> 00:07:11,874
Goki was seriously angry saying,

117
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:14,774
"It's nobody's business where I stop over!"

118
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:17,474
Then, the wine that Ena was holding

119
00:07:17,474 --> 00:07:19,674
splattered onto Goki's sweater.

120
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:21,774
And Ena started apologizing and crying

121
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,874
saying that she'd buy him a new one,

122
00:07:24,874 --> 00:07:27,774
so the party kind of drained away last week too.

123
00:07:27,774 --> 00:07:30,074
But it's strange.

124
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:34,474
Ena used to say before that she hated classic cars and yet...

125
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:40,074
The classic car, a wool sweater.

126
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:41,674
Stopping over...

127
00:07:41,674 --> 00:07:43,674
Wait a sec, this is...

128
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:47,174
The investigation's over.

129
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:54,174
So, leave the rest up to the police

130
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,174
and go enjoy camping.

131
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:58,474
Yes, sir.

132
00:07:58,474 --> 00:08:00,074
See you.

133
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,474
Enjoy? No way.

134
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:05,874
Because we're concerned about the incident.

135
00:08:05,874 --> 00:08:08,174
So we can't possibly enjoy ourselves.

136
00:08:08,174 --> 00:08:11,374
Hey, Shinichi. Can't you solve the case yet?

137
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:14,674
No, I know I'm almost there, but...

138
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:17,474
I don't care what,

139
00:08:17,474 --> 00:08:20,074
but why don't we talk after getting in the car?

140
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:21,174
I guess so.

141
00:08:21,174 --> 00:08:22,774
Besides, it's getting a bit chilly too.

142
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:26,974
Boy, go ahead and get in the car then!

143
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:29,574
I hate to say this, but open the door for me then.

144
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:33,074
You'd better cut it, girl!

145
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:34,674
Just who the hell do you think you are?

146
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:37,274
Open the door! Please...

147
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:41,874
Don't tell me that you're...

148
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:45,374
Please.

149
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:55,274
Okay, I'll teach you a good way then!

150
00:08:55,274 --> 00:08:56,574
If it's before you get in the car,

151
00:08:56,574 --> 00:08:58,374
touch the asphalt pavement,

152
00:08:58,374 --> 00:09:00,574
and if it's the door knob, touch the wall.

153
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:03,074
I didn't ask you that question, did I?

154
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:05,474
I'm telling you to open the door for me!

155
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:07,974
Try it.

156
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:09,074
While you're at it,

157
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:10,974
maybe opening your hands wide like this...

158
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:15,674
Opening your hands wide?

159
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:17,474
You mean, stone, paper, scissors?

160
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,274
I see. That's why...

161
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:23,374
it's the classic car.

162
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:27,074
That's why Ena

163
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:29,474
didn't want him to stop by anywhere.

164
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:35,674
She had schemed to make Mr. Sudo himself

165
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:37,774
the ignition device!

166
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:41,274
The police officer said just a while ago too!

167
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:42,974
That the gasoline poly tank

168
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:45,274
that happened to be in the garage was knocked over

169
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:48,474
and the gasoline vaporized, filling the garage.

170
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:50,674
And when Sudo got out of the car,

171
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,374
holding a cigarette in his mouth

172
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:54,074
in the garage filled with evaporated gasoline,

173
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:56,074
it caught fire and exploded, right?

174
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:58,174
It's obviously an accident!

175
00:09:58,174 --> 00:10:01,974
And yet, why do we have to continue being interrogated further?

176
00:10:01,974 --> 00:10:05,474
No, the person that the police wants to interrogate

177
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:09,374
is you, Mr. Goki Sudo's fiance,

178
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:13,574
only you, Ms. Ena Ginbayashi!

179
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:17,274
The thing about the poly tank with the gasoline inside being knocked over

180
00:10:17,274 --> 00:10:19,074
for three weeks straight

181
00:10:19,074 --> 00:10:22,174
really seems to bug this boy and he wants to ask you questions.

182
00:10:22,174 --> 00:10:24,374
He won't take no for an answer.

183
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:27,074
Not this brat again!

184
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:28,674
What is it with you?

185
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:32,574
I just told the Inspector to ask her a small question.

186
00:10:32,574 --> 00:10:34,874
It may be that someone

187
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:38,474
deliberately knocked the poly tank over after all.

188
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:41,874
Well, I just want to ask you a bit more things.

189
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:45,274
I guess I've got no choice.

190
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:47,974
I've got to go to the police and tell them

191
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:51,474
that there're no bad people like that here.

192
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:54,474
But I don't want to take the police car.

193
00:10:54,474 --> 00:10:56,874
It's like I'm being arrested or something,

194
00:10:56,874 --> 00:10:58,174
so I'll take my car.

195
00:10:58,174 --> 00:10:59,674
Oh, right!

196
00:11:00,574 --> 00:11:02,174
Since we're the last ones who saw Mr. Sudo,

197
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:04,974
we're also being summoned by the police.

198
00:11:04,974 --> 00:11:08,374
So, why don't we all go in our car?

199
00:11:09,974 --> 00:11:12,674
Okay.

200
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:15,474
You came with quite a number of people, didn't you?

201
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,274
I wonder if I can ride together?

202
00:11:17,274 --> 00:11:20,774
It'll be fine! Don't worry about them.

203
00:11:20,774 --> 00:11:24,074
They're all absorbed in that car over there, so...

204
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:26,374
Are you really letting us ride a police car?

205
00:11:26,374 --> 00:11:27,974
I'm honored!

206
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:32,474
But I guess not, after all.

207
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:34,574
I'll take my car.

208
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:37,474
Oh, that's too bad.

209
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:40,374
I had something I wanted to show you.

210
00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:43,674
Something you want me to see?

211
00:11:43,674 --> 00:11:47,274
Yep! I picked it up on my way here to the villa.

212
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:48,874
It belongs to Mr. Sudo.

213
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,174
I haven't shown the police officers it yet either.

214
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:55,974
Don't you want to see it?

215
00:11:55,974 --> 00:11:59,274
Yes, well, sort of.

216
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:08,218
How do you like this car?

217
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:09,518
Pretty good, don't you think?

218
00:12:09,518 --> 00:12:12,218
Well, to say nothing of comfortable riding,

219
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:14,018
the shape is cute.

220
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:16,618
What's this car called?

221
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:19,318
It's called the Beetle,

222
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:21,118
because it looks like the insect.

223
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:24,618
Come to think of it, it does look similar.

224
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,218
Oh, mail?

225
00:12:26,218 --> 00:12:28,318
Yep, to my friend!

226
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:31,318
Because we're finally in the cell phone service range area.

227
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,718
After you finish mailing,

228
00:12:33,718 --> 00:12:35,518
will you show it to me?

229
00:12:35,518 --> 00:12:38,418
His thing that you say you picked up.

230
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:39,618
Okay.

231
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:44,018
This!

232
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:48,118
This is the emblem of Goki's car.

233
00:12:48,118 --> 00:12:50,218
Do you know about it?

234
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:51,218
Yes.

235
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:58,218
It was on the nose of Goki's classic car.

236
00:12:58,218 --> 00:13:01,018
Are you sure it's really from his car?

237
00:13:01,018 --> 00:13:03,818
Yep, after the explosion,

238
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:07,818
it was found on the road below the villa, after it came flying to us.

239
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:15,518
But...

240
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:18,518
you don't like classic cars, right?

241
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:26,518
If so, why did you ask Mr. Sudo to come in that car?

242
00:13:26,518 --> 00:13:29,218
I... I began to like it

243
00:13:29,218 --> 00:13:30,918
after being influenced by him.

244
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:34,818
Besides, it seems that Mr. Sudo didn't like wool

245
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:38,118
and yet why did you make him wear a wool sweater before coming here?

246
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:41,518
Because... because I thought he'd look good in it.

247
00:13:41,518 --> 00:13:45,218
All he ever used to wear was fleece, so...

248
00:13:45,218 --> 00:13:47,118
Come to think of it,

249
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,518
you're wearing a wool sweater and fleece jacket today too, aren't you, Ai?

250
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:52,718
So, what?

251
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:56,718
Well, I just thought I'd ask.

252
00:13:56,718 --> 00:14:01,018
Then, this is the only thing that you picked up, Sonny?

253
00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:03,118
Yep, that's right.

254
00:14:03,118 --> 00:14:06,118
Did you think it was something else?

255
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:08,218
No, not really.

256
00:14:09,818 --> 00:14:11,518
Out of gas again.

257
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,318
Oh, boy. The officer just brought you

258
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:15,818
some gasoline to put into your car just a while ago and yet...

259
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:20,018
What now?

260
00:14:20,018 --> 00:14:22,918
There aren't any service stations around here, either.

261
00:14:22,918 --> 00:14:25,118
Then, why don't we go to your house to get some?

262
00:14:25,118 --> 00:14:27,718
You had a can of gasoline in your garage, didn't you?

263
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:29,818
Oh, that's right!

264
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:31,118
There are some that I bought in order to go camping

265
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:33,418
and forgot to load in car.

266
00:14:33,418 --> 00:14:37,218
Sorry, but I hope you don't mind us stopping by at Doc's house.

267
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:38,518
Sure.

268
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:52,518
I'm sorry. One moment, please.

269
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,818
There it is!

270
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:00,418
This is it.

271
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,118
Just what do you think you're doing?

272
00:15:16,118 --> 00:15:20,018
The gasoline tank being knocked down in the garage

273
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:24,118
is just like the garage of the villa that caught fire just a while ago.

274
00:15:24,118 --> 00:15:25,118
Yes.

275
00:15:25,118 --> 00:15:26,718
But we'll be fine

276
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,018
because there's nobody who smokes here.

277
00:15:29,018 --> 00:15:30,818
I... I see.

278
00:15:30,818 --> 00:15:32,618
I'm sorry, Ai,

279
00:15:32,618 --> 00:15:35,918
but could you get me the towel that's in the trunk?

280
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:39,218
You can open it with the car key.

281
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:41,618
Gosh, he is so hopeless.

282
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:42,618
Hey...

283
00:15:46,118 --> 00:15:47,118
No!

284
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,218
No! Don't put the key inside!

285
00:15:55,218 --> 00:15:57,018
Static will cause sparks of fire!

286
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:11,718
So, static was the ignition device after all.

287
00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:17,418
Your remark just now cleared everything.

288
00:16:17,418 --> 00:16:21,018
You made Mr. Sudo wear a combination of clothes

289
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:23,818
that would accumulate a lot of static fleece and wool.

290
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:28,118
You also made him come a long way by car to that villa garage

291
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:30,818
that was filled with evaporated gasoline.

292
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:32,718
When Mr. Sudo got off the car,

293
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:34,318
the moment he inserted the key into the keyhole

294
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:37,018
in order to lock the door,

295
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:39,418
static caused sparks of fire which ignited the gasoline...

296
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:47,818
and that was the set up that burned him to death.

297
00:16:47,818 --> 00:16:49,318
When you're driving,

298
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:54,518
your back rubs against the seat, causing static to build up.

299
00:16:54,518 --> 00:16:58,918
Moreover, the motive of why you had him come with his classic car

300
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:02,718
is because recent cars are usually equipped with keyless remote controllers

301
00:17:02,718 --> 00:17:04,318
that when you lock the door,

302
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,218
you don't need to insert the key into the keyhole.

303
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:11,018
In other words, you don't have to touch overcharged static

304
00:17:11,018 --> 00:17:14,318
caused by metal against metal.

305
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:19,318
But there are times that static causes only a prickly feeling, right?

306
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:21,718
I wonder if it would give off sparks of fire so conveniently.

307
00:17:21,718 --> 00:17:25,318
It's true that just once won't do it,

308
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:28,518
but if you were planning to do it until sparks of fire would occur one day,

309
00:17:28,518 --> 00:17:30,118
you're sure to succeed someday!

310
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,718
You seem to have actually tried it

311
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:36,118
three weeks in a row already, right?

312
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:40,518
The week before last, static didn't occur

313
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,618
because Mr. Sudo wasn't wearing a wool sweater

314
00:17:43,618 --> 00:17:45,618
and came with a new model car.

315
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:47,618
Last week, you didn't succeed because Mr. Sudo stopped over

316
00:17:47,618 --> 00:17:51,218
at the convenience store to buy a drink.

317
00:17:51,218 --> 00:17:54,218
Once you get out of the car and touch something,

318
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:57,418
the static that built up until then flows out.

319
00:17:57,418 --> 00:18:00,618
So, even if you put the key in the keyhole of the car,

320
00:18:00,618 --> 00:18:03,418
it wouldn't be enough to create sparks of fire.

321
00:18:03,418 --> 00:18:08,218
And then you got into a fight and soiled his sweater with wine

322
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:11,918
in order make him take off his sweater as soon as possible.

323
00:18:11,918 --> 00:18:14,918
Because if he keeps wearing the sweater and static builds up,

324
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:17,318
you didn't want him to go out

325
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:21,918
and buy static proofclothes.

326
00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:24,818
Of course you didn't want Mr. Sudo to discuss with anybody

327
00:18:24,818 --> 00:18:28,118
about how to become static proof.

328
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:29,818
Yes, like for example,

329
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:33,118
before getting off the car and touching the ground with your feet,

330
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:34,718
place your hand on the roof of the car.

331
00:18:34,718 --> 00:18:36,318
If you're getting on the car,

332
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:38,518
before touching the door, touch the ground.

333
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:41,418
If you're going to touch the door knob, touch the wall first

334
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:44,618
to release the static build up in your body.

335
00:18:44,618 --> 00:18:46,818
There seems to be people who are so afraid of static

336
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:50,518
that they try to touch the object with just one finger,

337
00:18:50,518 --> 00:18:52,718
but in order to disperse the amount of overcharged static,

338
00:18:52,718 --> 00:18:55,318
it's better to touch the object with the palm of your hand

339
00:18:55,318 --> 00:18:58,218
to avoid the prick.

340
00:18:58,218 --> 00:19:00,418
If Mr. Sudo didn't like wool sweaters,

341
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:01,918
didn't usually wear them,

342
00:19:01,918 --> 00:19:04,918
and wasn't exposed to too much static,

343
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:06,918
you could coordinate a combination of wool and fleece

344
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:10,818
that help in building up static.

345
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:13,018
Then if you make him insert the key into the keyhole,

346
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,118
there is a high possibility that static would occur.

347
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:20,218
Besides, he would be off his guard that static won't happen to him.

348
00:19:20,218 --> 00:19:23,818
But why on earth did you choose to kill him this way?

349
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:26,518
Because you not only want to get rid of Mr. Sudo,

350
00:19:26,518 --> 00:19:28,918
but wanted to get rid of the car too.

351
00:19:30,818 --> 00:19:33,418
Yes, that's right.

352
00:19:33,418 --> 00:19:35,718
I wanted to get rid of him as well as that car

353
00:19:35,718 --> 00:19:37,718
and erase them from this world.

354
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,418
I wanted to get rid of

355
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:43,918
that ruthless devil disguised under the face of a human!

356
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:46,718
My father had a bad heart.

357
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:50,018
He got an attack when he was out driving

358
00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:52,118
with my mother who couldn't drive.

359
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:53,818
Since they were in a mountain road

360
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,618
where there were not too many people around,

361
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:58,018
they couldn't get to a hospital and father died.

362
00:19:58,018 --> 00:20:01,718
But he was just unlucky.

363
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:06,418
Yes, it's true that he was unlucky

364
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:10,118
because right after my father had the attack and stopped his car,

365
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:14,718
the car that happened to pass by was the car of that guy.

366
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:17,618
My mother begged him to take them to the hospital,

367
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:20,218
but he told her...

368
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:24,018
Stay here till you die, old lady!

369
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:28,418
From the shock of that incident,

370
00:20:28,418 --> 00:20:31,218
my mother fell ill and passed away

371
00:20:31,218 --> 00:20:35,418
as if going after father.

372
00:20:35,418 --> 00:20:39,418
Before she died, mother told me that the car that the guy drove

373
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:45,718
had a silver statue with its wings spread out.

374
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:50,518
So, I checked everywhere I could for the owner of a classic car

375
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:54,318
with a silver statue with its wings spread out.

376
00:20:54,318 --> 00:20:57,618
But Sonny, you sure go all out.

377
00:20:57,618 --> 00:21:02,118
If that girl inserted the key into the keyhole before I stopped her,

378
00:21:02,118 --> 00:21:04,318
I hate to think what would've happened.

379
00:21:04,318 --> 00:21:05,618
No problem.

380
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:08,618
There is no keyhole on the trunk of a Beetle.

381
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:09,818
And with the mail I sent a while ago,

382
00:21:09,818 --> 00:21:11,918
I asked a certain person

383
00:21:11,918 --> 00:21:15,218
to change the contents in the tank to water too.

384
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:45,418
This racing game sure is fun!

385
00:22:45,418 --> 00:22:47,918
Doc sure does a good job at times!

386
00:22:47,918 --> 00:22:49,818
Huh? Where's Ai?

387
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:53,418
I'm sure she's up already.

388
00:22:53,418 --> 00:22:57,618
Don't tell me that she's still in a bad mood?

389
00:22:57,618 --> 00:22:59,818
Come off it.

390
00:22:59,818 --> 00:23:03,718
Ai was suffering with static pricking at her from morning.

391
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:05,918
And on top of that, she seems to have lost

392
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,518
her static proof goods too.

393
00:23:09,718 --> 00:23:12,218
Opening the palm of your hand completely would help.

394
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:28,518
Ai, why don't you join us playing the game too?

395
00:23:28,518 --> 00:23:30,018
It's fun!

396
00:23:30,018 --> 00:23:32,218
Okay.

397
00:23:32,218 --> 00:23:34,818
But I'm a strong player, you know.

398
00:23:34,818 --> 00:23:38,318
Ai, can you do that?

399
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:40,118
You're the tops, the lone victor!

400
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,118
Wow! Wow!

401
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:45,118
It sure feels weird when she's in a good mood though.

402
00:23:47,118 --> 00:23:49,918
"Next episode" -The man sitting at the counter

403
00:23:49,918 --> 00:23:52,818
looks just like a man that I know!

404
00:23:52,818 --> 00:23:56,018
Well, you see...

405
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,518
The victim is Azusa's older brother,

406
00:23:58,518 --> 00:24:00,418
Sugito's superior and...

407
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:03,518
We're staking out here

408
00:24:03,518 --> 00:24:05,218
because he may contact his younger sister.

409
00:24:06,518 --> 00:24:07,618
Conan.

410
00:24:10,018 --> 00:24:11,618
This is...

411
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,118
Next Conan,

412
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:17,018
"A Delivery From the Real Culprit".

413
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:30,018
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:32,118
"The ribbon of a parcel".

415
00:24:32,118 --> 00:24:33,618
The coffee shop Poirot is below the agency.

416
00:24:33,618 --> 00:24:35,918
I am Poirot.

417
00:24:35,918 --> 00:24:37,318
No, you're not.
