1
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:07,323
I'm amazed we can see them so clearly.

2
00:00:07,323 --> 00:00:10,523
It was sunny today and the weather's really good.

3
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:13,623
The humidity's low, so it's a little chilly.

4
00:00:13,623 --> 00:00:17,423
All the conditions for clearly seeing the stars are being met.

5
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:19,623
Really?

6
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:22,323
Conan, you know something about everything.

7
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:25,123
That's what my teacher told me.

8
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:28,623
You've got no dreams or sense of romance, kid.

9
00:00:31,623 --> 00:00:33,623
It's beautiful!

10
00:00:34,823 --> 00:00:36,623
Watch out, Sonoko!

11
00:00:46,023 --> 00:00:49,323
So, why are we stargazing?

12
00:00:49,323 --> 00:00:52,823
The Milky Way refers to the band of stars in the sky,

13
00:00:52,823 --> 00:00:56,023
but Sonoko thought it was the name of a cafe.

14
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:58,923
She asked me which of their sweets are best.

15
00:00:58,923 --> 00:01:00,023
What?

16
00:01:00,023 --> 00:01:02,023
When she learned it referred to the stars, she said,

17
00:01:02,023 --> 00:01:05,023
"I'm so embarrassed! We're going stargazing tonight!"

18
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,723
and dug out her binoculars.

19
00:01:08,723 --> 00:01:10,723
It seems like she's already bored though.

20
00:01:10,723 --> 00:01:13,223
She's not looking at the sky.

21
00:01:15,523 --> 00:01:16,523
What?

22
00:01:18,623 --> 00:01:20,223
What is that?

23
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:32,723
What's wrong?

24
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:35,223
I saw a hand!

25
00:01:35,223 --> 00:01:37,523
Someone's hand was in the flowerbed!

26
00:01:39,323 --> 00:01:41,423
When the countdown reaches zero,

27
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:43,823
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

28
00:01:46,223 --> 00:01:48,323
She coincidentally saw a pale hand and ring.

29
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:50,423
High school girl detective Sonoko is fired up.

30
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:51,923
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:51,923 --> 00:01:53,623
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:55,723
His name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:39,457
"High School Girl Detective Sonoko Suzuki"

34
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:49,299
I don't see anything.

35
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:50,399
Calm down.

36
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:52,599
What happened?

37
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,999
Another hand grabbed an arm.

38
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:58,899
When they let go, it flopped down.

39
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:01,499
That was definitely the hand of a corpse.

40
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:04,699
Which way were you pointing the binoculars?

41
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:05,899
North.

42
00:04:05,899 --> 00:04:07,099
I found the North Star

43
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,299
and was looking directly beneath it.

44
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,499
I'm sure of it.

45
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:14,699
Let's go, high school girl detectives!

46
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,999
Sonoko, that's south.

47
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:20,399
-That way! -High school girl detectives?

48
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,199
This way is north of the park.

49
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:42,399
This is the place I saw.

50
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:46,699
They hid the body here.

51
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:50,899
There's no sign of any body.

52
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:54,099
I'm sure of it. These are the same flowers.

53
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:56,599
They must've buried it behind the flowerbed.

54
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:59,099
Who buried what?

55
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,299
A body...

56
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:04,699
Who are you?

57
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:07,099
"Hiroto Sasaki (40), Sasaki Studio Director" -I work here.

58
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,299
Who are you?

59
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:11,599
I see.

60
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:14,299
You build mannequins here.

61
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:17,499
Yes. Here, have some coffee.

62
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:19,299
"Rika Minakami (25), Assistant" -Thank you.

63
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:21,499
Sorry for interrupting your work.

64
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:22,499
It's fine.

65
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,699
Sorry.

66
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,199
Does this look like the arm you saw?

67
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,499
You must've gotten confused.

68
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,099
That's impossible!

69
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:35,399
But, Sonoko,

70
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,799
were you able to tell at a glance

71
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:39,899
if it was a human hand or a doll's?

72
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:47,499
And could you have seen that flowerbed from the top of the slide?

73
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:48,999
What do you mean?

74
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:55,499
What...

75
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:57,799
What?

76
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,099
You're right.

77
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:01,299
I can only see the clock.

78
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:02,999
Since you can't see it from here,

79
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:06,599
you couldn't see here from there.

80
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,399
But I know I saw something.

81
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:12,899
You can see the slide from the roof.

82
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:15,299
Hold on. A flowerbed, right?

83
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:17,299
Is there one on the roof?

84
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:18,999
Not here,

85
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:20,999
but the same flowerbeds are on the roof

86
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:22,699
of the Yoshimura building behind ours.

87
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:24,099
Right, Rika?

88
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:25,799
What? Yes.

89
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:28,699
This property used to be long and narrow,

90
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:31,699
but I split it with my friend, Yoshimura.

91
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,599
The fastest way to his building is to cut through mine.

92
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:38,699
I'm going to finish that rush order.

93
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,899
Thank you. Sorry for interrupting you in the middle of shopping.

94
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:49,499
We get some willful clients sometimes. It's a hassle.

95
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:52,099
They suddenly called to modify their order.

96
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:54,299
I just had her come back.

97
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,699
His building is three stories, too.

98
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,099
His work means he's good at designing flowerbeds,

99
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,099
so I had Yoshimura handle mine, too.

100
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:16,399
"Yoshimura Reforestation Research Institute" -The same flowerbeds

101
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,599
"Main Entrance" -are on the roof here.

102
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:21,799
Maybe Nanae's not home.

103
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:24,199
Is this Yoshimura person not here?

104
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,999
He's in Hakodate for business.

105
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,299
He's repairing the front of this building in the meantime.

106
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:35,099
She's Yoshimura's wife.

107
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,099
The three of us attended college together.

108
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:41,999
She always keeps her phone on her when she goes out.

109
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:43,699
That's odd.

110
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,499
I'm worried.

111
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:46,799
About what?

112
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,199
If what I saw was on the roof,

113
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,499
then the body's buried up there.

114
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:53,099
That's impossible.

115
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,799
The flowerbeds have the same design,

116
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:57,299
but since they're on the roof, the dirt's too shallow.

117
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:59,299
But I know I saw something!

118
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:04,299
Did you really see the body being buried?

119
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:09,099
No, but that hand definitely didn't belong to a living person.

120
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:10,099
Excuse me.

121
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:11,599
Yoshimura?

122
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,899
Good timing.

123
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,799
There's something I wanted to ask you.

124
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,499
Yeah. I tried calling, too.

125
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:23,499
I see.

126
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:26,799
Got it. I'm going inside.

127
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:29,499
We have spare keys to each other's buildings.

128
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:32,899
Yoshimura was worried about his wife.

129
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:36,199
She was supposed to call him now.

130
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:38,599
Does that mean she should be home?

131
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,999
Then maybe she really was...

132
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:43,899
You're jinxing it. Cut it out.

133
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:44,899
Right.

134
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:47,499
Nanae.

135
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:57,799
Her car's here.

136
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:09,699
Oh, I forgot.

137
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:12,999
The water pipe under the street out front broke.

138
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,699
Then she can't move her car.

139
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:17,999
What time did it break?

140
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:21,699
Nanae complained about it over the phone.

141
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:24,699
Since it was after Rika went shopping,

142
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:27,099
it must've been after 6:30 pm.

143
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,999
She was all right until then.

144
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:34,099
Nanae.

145
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:36,999
Are you home?

146
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,999
This is Yoshimura's private living space.

147
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,499
What's this?

148
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:51,899
That's Nanae's phone.

149
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,199
The flowerbed's out here.

150
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,699
I can see the slide.

151
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:03,899
This must be the roof I saw.

152
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,399
There aren't any signs anyone buried a body.

153
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,399
But there's a spade over there.

154
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,399
Someone must've dug up the dirt to bury a body.

155
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:25,899
It's too shallow to bury a body.

156
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:29,799
Does that mean the culprit took the body somewhere?

157
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,799
You're still going on about that?

158
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,699
They'd transport it using a car.

159
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,999
It's the obvious choice.

160
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,799
They couldn't have done that.

161
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,199
The car's blocked in.

162
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:40,299
You're right.

163
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:42,299
By the time Sonoko looked through her binoculars,

164
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:44,899
the road was already under construction.

165
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:51,899
Sonoko, what's wrong?

166
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,099
I've got it!

167
00:10:54,099 --> 00:10:55,199
Got what?

168
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:59,599
The body of Yoshimura's wife is still inside the building!

169
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:01,599
What?

170
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:10,199
The wife was murdered after the director called her.

171
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:12,599
But the killer couldn't use the road.

172
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:16,099
When they failed to bury the body in the flowerbed,

173
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:19,399
how did they dispose of the body?

174
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,999
There's one logical conclusion.

175
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:25,599
The culprit couldn't dispose of it.

176
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,099
Seriously?

177
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:28,699
In other words,

178
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:31,999
the body should still be hidden in this building!

179
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,599
Listen, miss.

180
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:38,899
Was the wife's body hidden there?

181
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,399
-What? -Or over there?

182
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,799
Hold on, Sonoko.

183
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,399
Or over there?

184
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,999
Anyway, Ran.

185
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:51,999
Yes?

186
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:54,299
Let's find the body!

187
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:57,899
High school girl detectives, go!

188
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,799
Is she okay?

189
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:11,099
You can't hide a person in there, Sonoko.

190
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:22,199
We didn't find anything.

191
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,799
We found something.

192
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,899
What?

193
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,299
The sleeping bag.

194
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:29,099
We found a man's, but not a woman's.

195
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:31,099
They put the body in there and hid it.

196
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:32,899
That's enough!

197
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,399
We searched everywhere but didn't find anything.

198
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,499
She must've left on some urgent business.

199
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,599
I don't have anymore time for you.

200
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:43,099
This alleyway will take you out to the street.

201
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:45,199
Just leave.

202
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,499
We're sorry.

203
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:01,928
I know I saw something...

204
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,180
through these.

205
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,580
But we didn't find a body anywhere.

206
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,380
Besides, even if there was a body, who killed them?

207
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,580
Well...

208
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,780
He's suspicious.

209
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,880
It's weird how he got so angry and denied that there was a body.

210
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,680
Really weird.

211
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,480
You mean Sasaki?

212
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,580
Conan, what do you think?

213
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,780
Conan?

214
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,080
But, Sonoko,

215
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,680
did Sasaki have any time to go to the neighboring building?

216
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,780
He was alone in his office.

217
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,380
He must've snuck over.

218
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,380
If Minakami came down while Sasaki was gone,

219
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,280
he would've been discovered immediately.

220
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,680
Besides, he knew the dirt on the roof was too shallow.

221
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,380
Oh, come on.

222
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,080
Then it could be Minakami.

223
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,380
What does that mean?

224
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,080
What if on her way back from shopping,

225
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,980
she stopped at the neighboring building and quickly took care of it?

226
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,480
But she was asked to return to the studio by Sasaki.

227
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,780
I'm not sure she could do it that quickly.

228
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,680
Then she could've gone back later.

229
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,480
Sorry, but no.

230
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,780
She was working on the third floor after that.

231
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,280
Sasaki would've found her if she came downstairs.

232
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,280
I knew it didn't make sense.

233
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:38,380
Maybe the hand you saw belonged to a mannequin and not a person.

234
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,380
I'm starting to think you're right.

235
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,480
-Good night. -Good night.

236
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,080
The ring...

237
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,880
Mannequins don't wear rings.

238
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,280
That must've been a human hand.

239
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,280
But where did they hide the body?

240
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,480
Where?

241
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,780
I'm sorry!

242
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,180
What is this?

243
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,080
Oh, the sign's backwards.

244
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,480
Sorry.

245
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,380
Here. Now it's flipped back outside...

246
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,480
Backwards?

247
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,180
The back!

248
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,380
I never searched the back!

249
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,780
Conan?

250
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,780
Are you thinking about Sonoko?

251
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,680
But like I said, we didn't find a body.

252
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,580
Even if Sonoko saw a real body,

253
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:19,380
neither Sasaki nor Minakami could've hidden it.

254
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,180
It'd be different story if there were a bridge

255
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,080
connecting the two buildings though.

256
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,280
A bridge?

257
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,680
Yeah. I tried calling, too.

258
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,880
I see. Got it.

259
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,380
I know what happened there

260
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,480
and who did it.

261
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,480
You'll be in big trouble if the director finds you again.

262
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,680
I'm glad I found you, Minakami.

263
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,980
I'm sure I saw a corpse and not a mannequin.

264
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,380
What?

265
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,080
Ran, remember what you said earlier?

266
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,480
It's a different story if there's a bridge.

267
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,680
Yeah, but...

268
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,680
I saw the shadow of the bridge connecting the two buildings.

269
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,180
The culprit was able to return to the flowerbed

270
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,180
and dispose of the body.

271
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,780
I took this key without the director's permission,

272
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,080
so be quiet.

273
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,980
Thank you, Minakami.

274
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,380
You'd better hurry.

275
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,680
I will!

276
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,080
After killing the victim Nanae,

277
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,180
the culprit had to return to the Sasaki building.

278
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,780
So they built a bridge between the two buildings

279
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,180
so they could return quickly

280
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,180
using the scaffolding for the Yoshimura building repairs.

281
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,880
But I didn't see a bridge.

282
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,280
They returned it to the roof

283
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,380
of the Yoshimura building when they were finished with it

284
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,780
using some rope.

285
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,080
Then who did it?

286
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,380
The culprit is the person who was suddenly asked

287
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,280
to return to the Sasaki building.

288
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,980
The person who was able to hide the body

289
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,180
by the time we got to the roof of the Yoshimura building,

290
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,780
and remove the bridge connecting their roofs.

291
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,580
You mean...

292
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,880
That's right.

293
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,980
The culprit is Sasaki's assistant,

294
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,780
Rika Minakami!

295
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,780
The culprit must've been troubled

296
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,780
since they couldn't transport the body by car

297
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,580
like they planned because of the water pipe construction.

298
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,380
Yes, it was troubling.

299
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,180
In their desperation,

300
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,280
they remembered the flowerbed on the roof,

301
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,980
but the dirt was too shallow.

302
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,280
Yes.

303
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,880
But why did the culprit grab the body's hand?

304
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,880
To remove the ring.

305
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,880
It looked really expensive,

306
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,080
so they must've wanted it.

307
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,880
If the culprit still has the ring on them,

308
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,280
that would be an important piece of evidence.

309
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,180
More importantly, where's the body?

310
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,680
A place we forgot to search.

311
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,480
Behind the scaffolding used for repairs.

312
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,480
We can get to the roof through there.

313
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,780
Sonoko and Minakami are on the roof.

314
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,880
What?

315
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,780
The body would be found by morning if they hid it here.

316
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,180
No. If the street repairs are finished during the night,

317
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,580
they can take the car early tomorrow morning.

318
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,380
I see.

319
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,080
You certainly are a prodigy.

320
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,580
Seems that way.

321
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,480
Prodigiously stupid.

322
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,580
I'm not that astute.

323
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,180
So was Nanae.

324
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,180
Nanae? Yoshimura's wife?

325
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,480
Yes.

326
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,080
She didn't realize I'd stolen her husband.

327
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,580
Nanae paid to establish her husband's company.

328
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,280
Naturally she assumed her husband obeyed her whims.

329
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,980
Right? Don't you think she's stupid?

330
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,180
The pipes are in the way.

331
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,780
If only they'd come out a little farther.

332
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,380
And then there's Yoshimura.

333
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,480
His promises to leave Nanae were all talk.

334
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,280
Don't move.

335
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,580
If I miss, it'll hurt even more.

336
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,780
Help me, Ran.

337
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,380
Now!

338
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,080
Sonoko, hang in there!

339
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,480
Ran!

340
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,980
I don't want to be a detective anymore!

341
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,480
I was negligent.

342
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,680
I'm sorry.

343
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,080
The culprit was unconscious when she was arrested.

344
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,080
You can relax now, Sonoko.

345
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Here.

346
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,180
Anyway, I'm impressed that you figured out who did it.

347
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:16,480
You must be a genius to have figured out that trick.

348
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:26,380
Someday I'd like to build a mannequin of you striking a jaunty pose.

349
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:31,280
When you do, please name your mannequin

350
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,780
"The High School Girl Detective"!

351
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,680
We'll be hearing about this for a long time.

352
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,880
Yeah.

353
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,880
Of course.

354
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:47,180
"Next Episode"

355
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,080
"Okita"

356
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,380
What?

357
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,980
It's like they were breaking in a new sword.

358
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,580
Furthermore,

359
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,880
this looks like the work of a rather skilled swordsman.

360
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
Who are you?

361
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,280
Next Conan,

362
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,980
"Kendo Tournament of Love and Mystery (Part 1)"
