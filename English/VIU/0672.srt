1
00:00:01,664 --> 00:00:04,664
A request that seemed at first glance to be a simple one,

2
00:00:04,664 --> 00:00:07,864
came in on the newly opened website.

3
00:00:07,864 --> 00:00:09,464
However, Pops receives mail from the client asking

4
00:00:09,464 --> 00:00:11,964
to change the meeting place,

5
00:00:11,964 --> 00:00:18,164
so Pops takes me, Ran and his disciple, Amuro, over to the place,

6
00:00:18,164 --> 00:00:21,064
but the client doesn't show up.

7
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:23,064
Therefore, we all returned to the agency after that.

8
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,464
Then, the client contacts Pops again,

9
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:28,564
and we were just about to leave the agency a second time.

10
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:32,264
Everyone, please be quiet.

11
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:34,764
This is probably what this is all about.

12
00:00:34,764 --> 00:00:38,664
There is a person who doesn't want the client to meet with Mr. Mouri.

13
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,164
So that person sends Mr. Mouri a fake mail

14
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:43,464
asking to change the place of meeting to get him out of the agency.

15
00:00:43,464 --> 00:00:45,964
Then, that person acts as if he is an employee of the agency

16
00:00:45,964 --> 00:00:48,364
and meets with the client.

17
00:00:48,364 --> 00:00:50,464
But why would that person do something like that?

18
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:53,864
All the client wanted was for Dad to look for the coin locker, right?

19
00:00:53,864 --> 00:00:56,864
Maybe something unthinkable is in that locker?

20
00:00:56,864 --> 00:00:57,864
I wonder about that.

21
00:00:57,864 --> 00:00:59,564
Why don't we...

22
00:01:00,964 --> 00:01:03,864
ask the person himself?

23
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,064
The person himself?

24
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,464
Don't tell me that...

25
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:08,864
You got a reply mail just as you were about

26
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,064
to go to the restroom, didn't you, Sensei?

27
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:14,264
And, just when Conan was about to go to the restroom too.

28
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:17,264
Moreover, on the floor of the restroom

29
00:01:17,264 --> 00:01:20,364
there was a trace of something having been dragged along.

30
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:23,464
Right.

31
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:26,164
Most probably that someone for some reason,

32
00:01:26,164 --> 00:01:30,164
has the client with him and is still here

33
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:32,664
hiding inside the restroom.

34
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:37,564
Don't tell me...

35
00:01:41,064 --> 00:01:42,464
What?

36
00:01:47,064 --> 00:01:51,564
The woman that was confined in the restroom was Ms. Kei Kashizuka.

37
00:01:51,564 --> 00:01:55,564
She claims that she has never seen the man that was found dead beside her.

38
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:56,964
The belongings of the man was his cell phone

39
00:01:56,964 --> 00:01:58,364
which had no other data in it

40
00:01:58,364 --> 00:02:01,364
except for the mail that had been sent to Pops.

41
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:02,964
5,000 yen worth of loose change,

42
00:02:02,964 --> 00:02:05,764
and a wallet with quite a number of bills in it.

43
00:02:05,764 --> 00:02:07,864
Ms. Kashizuka went through a brief questioning,

44
00:02:07,864 --> 00:02:09,664
after which she was allowed to go home.

45
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:12,564
Amuro gives Ms. Kashizuka who finishes interrogation a lift home.

46
00:02:14,464 --> 00:02:17,964
Ms. Kashizuka, is this the road?

47
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:18,964
Yes.

48
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:22,064
By the way, why are you guys riding together?

49
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:23,764
It's cramped in here.

50
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:24,864
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:24,864 --> 00:02:28,264
This car isn't made to seat 3 people in the backseat, you see.

52
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:30,564
It's okay.

53
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:33,464
Why are you riding with us, Dad?

54
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:36,764
I was worried about Ms. Kei, that's why.

55
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:40,864
That man. I wonder if he really committed suicide.

56
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:44,164
But, there seems to have been no gun discharge residue

57
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:49,164
detected from Ms. Kashizuka's body

58
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:52,264
and what's even stranger is his cell phone.

59
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:53,264
Why was everything, except the mail

60
00:02:53,264 --> 00:02:55,364
that was sent to Pops the received/sent history,

61
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:58,464
including the address book all blank?

62
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:00,564
Besides, the things that were left back in his pocket,

63
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:03,564
the loose change and bills, that were in his wallet.

64
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:08,764
Why did he have to carry around so many bills and change?

65
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:10,464
One more thing.

66
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:14,564
She's hiding something.

67
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:18,364
The vivid colored memories of summer

68
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,264
solve mysteries all season round.

69
00:03:20,264 --> 00:03:22,064
The high-class condo of the client.

70
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:24,364
Something is strange and something smells.

71
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:25,964
He sees through the one and only truth.

72
00:03:25,964 --> 00:03:28,064
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

73
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:30,464
His name is Detective Conan.

74
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:16,245
"Nocturne of the Detectives (Kidnap)"

75
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:25,647
This is a nice condo.

76
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:27,547
I'll bet the rent is quite expensive, no?

77
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:29,447
Yes, sort of.

78
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:30,947
But I depended on my parents to help me out

79
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:33,547
and was living here with my older brother so...

80
00:05:33,547 --> 00:05:36,747
About here would be fine, you know.

81
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:39,447
I've already found that no one is ambushing me so...

82
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:41,347
I guess so.

83
00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:43,247
Okay, I guess we'll get going then.

84
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:46,247
I forgot that I had to use the restroom!

85
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:48,347
What shall I do? I'm going to pee in my pants.

86
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:51,247
Please, miss! The restroom, please let me use the restroom!

87
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:54,747
Please, I can't hold it any longer!

88
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:57,947
Okay. Hold on one second.

89
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:03,547
This smell. Don't tell me that...

90
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:06,447
The restroom is on the right after you go in the front door.

91
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:08,247
Yes, thank you.

92
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:13,047
Excuse me. Actually, I've been holding back too.

93
00:06:13,047 --> 00:06:15,247
Me too.

94
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:20,647
Good grief. Would you like to all drop by for a while, then?

95
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,547
All I've got to serve you is tea, though.

96
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:24,047
I'm sorry, Ms. Kei.

97
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:26,247
Don't be, it can't be helped.

98
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:29,447
Like they say, necessity has no law.

99
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:31,247
Dad!

100
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:44,147
Oh my, my there're sure a lot of dishes out here.

101
00:06:44,147 --> 00:06:46,747
Did you have a party or something last night?

102
00:06:46,747 --> 00:06:50,447
Yes, several of my college friends got together here.

103
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:52,747
I'm sorry it's messy.

104
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,847
No, no problem.

105
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:55,947
Let see.

106
00:06:55,947 --> 00:07:00,147
Kei, can I help you?

107
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:02,947
Could you clear the table off for me, then?

108
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:04,147
All right.

109
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:05,947
Today at around 16:00,

110
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:09,947
in the restroom of the Mouri Detective agency located on 5-Beika St.,

111
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:12,347
a shocking case of a man committing suicide

112
00:07:12,347 --> 00:07:14,447
shooting himself to death, occurred.

113
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:16,647
No joke! It's already being aired on the news.

114
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:17,747
Looks to be so.

115
00:07:17,747 --> 00:07:21,147
-The identity of the man is still unknown. -No! I'll bet Mom's worried.

116
00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:24,047
After all, I had my cell phone switched off.

117
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:26,847
Hello?

118
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,747
Why did you have the phone switched off?

119
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:30,447
You worried the wits out of me!

120
00:07:30,447 --> 00:07:31,447
Masumi?

121
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:34,547
I'm sorry, so sorry, we were busy here investigating on a case here.

122
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:38,447
And, are Conan... Kogo... okay?

123
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:40,647
I'm sorry. Your voice is choppy,

124
00:07:40,647 --> 00:07:42,947
and it's hard to make out what you're saying.

125
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:48,147
Hello, Masumi? Can you hear me all right on your side?

126
00:07:50,547 --> 00:07:52,547
-Ms. Kei! -Yes?

127
00:07:52,547 --> 00:07:56,647
Maybe this room is being wiretapped.

128
00:07:57,647 --> 00:08:00,847
But, how do you know?

129
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,947
Because of Ran's cell phone a while ago, right?

130
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:06,047
If a wiretap is set up,

131
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:09,147
there are times that cell phones have bad connection.

132
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:10,947
Just as would be expected of you, Mouri Sensei.

133
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:13,747
Ms. Kei, I will go through each of the rooms now

134
00:08:13,747 --> 00:08:16,147
and check where the wiretaps are set up,

135
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:17,747
so I hope you don't mind?

136
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,747
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:20,647
Could wait just 5 minutes.

138
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:23,347
They are all messed up.

139
00:08:23,347 --> 00:08:25,847
I'd like to put away my underwear so...

140
00:08:38,547 --> 00:08:40,747
Where are you going?

141
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:43,847
Miss.

142
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:45,647
I ran out of tea leaves,

143
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:47,047
so I'm going to the convenience store to buy some.

144
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:49,747
I'll go with you, then.

145
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:51,947
I want something too.

146
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:53,947
Would you like me to go get Ran, too?

147
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:55,847
No need! Let's go, just the two of us.

148
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:57,047
Yep.

149
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:05,347
10 minutes have passed already, but Ms. Kei hasn't come back yet.

150
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:06,947
I wonder if she went to the restroom?

151
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:11,347
Okay then, why don't we start looking for the wiretaps ourselves?

152
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:15,347
Ran, please stand in the middle of the room

153
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:20,447
that I'm searching and play the music in your cell phone full blast.

154
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:23,047
I'm going to use the sound

155
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:24,947
to figure out where the wiretap is and crush it.

156
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:30,847
You have a driver's license?

157
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:33,347
-Yes. -A driver's license is something

158
00:09:33,347 --> 00:09:35,747
that helps identify you, right?

159
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:39,747
Why didn't you show it to the inspector a while ago?

160
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,847
I didn't want to show it to him

161
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,247
because my picture on it is ugly.

162
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:45,747
How do you like it?

163
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:47,647
The fruit juice that I got for you

164
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:49,847
at the vending machine on our way here.

165
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:52,947
Yep. It's really delicious.

166
00:09:52,947 --> 00:09:57,547
The third one already.

167
00:09:57,547 --> 00:09:59,547
Here's one too.

168
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:03,247
Another one?

169
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:05,947
What's with this room? It really smells!

170
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:08,947
What is it? This smell?

171
00:10:08,947 --> 00:10:12,347
There seems to be a wiretap set up in this room too.

172
00:10:12,347 --> 00:10:13,647
You know what.

173
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:16,547
I haven't seen Conan or Ms. Kei anywhere since a while ago.

174
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:20,647
Never mind them for now. First, for the wiretaps.

175
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:40,347
It seems that the wiretap is under the bed.

176
00:10:41,547 --> 00:10:43,847
There's a large suitcase shoved in under here.

177
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:45,047
Move aside, will you?

178
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:46,647
Yes, sir.

179
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:51,847
Darn! It's so heavy.

180
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,947
So the wiretap's in here?

181
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,847
It seems that the smell's coming from here too.

182
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:02,247
Let's open it, at any rate.

183
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:36,996
It seems the wiretap's under the bed.

184
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:40,796
There's a huge suitcase under the bed.

185
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:41,996
Move aside, will you?

186
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:43,596
Yes, sir.

187
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:49,096
Darn! It's so heavy.

188
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:53,696
So the wiretap's in here?

189
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:56,496
It seems that the smell's coming from here too.

190
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:59,196
Let's open it, anyway.

191
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:10,396
Why is there a corpse in the suitcase?

192
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,696
Rather. Who is he anyway?

193
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:15,896
He's pretty small, isn't he?

194
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:17,896
He seems to have been beaten to death.

195
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:20,796
I guess he's been dead for a little more than a day.

196
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:24,796
Just as I thought. The wiretap is in here.

197
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:28,296
At any rate, let's ask Kei, the resident of this room about this.

198
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:31,896
But, I don't think she's here already.

199
00:12:33,396 --> 00:12:38,196
When I went pass the front door a while ago, her boots were gone.

200
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:42,196
Back then, I thought she had put them back in the shoe box.

201
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:45,396
It's also thinkable that she fled

202
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:49,396
when she found out we were going to search the rooms for the wiretaps,

203
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:52,196
because she figured that we would eventually find this suitcase.

204
00:12:52,196 --> 00:12:55,996
Then, are you saying that the one who killed this man is Kei?

205
00:12:55,996 --> 00:12:58,696
I can't conclude it to be so yet, though.

206
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:03,696
But, I'm also bothered that Conan's shoes are gone too.

207
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:05,496
No! Why?

208
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:06,796
I wonder...

209
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:09,096
Maybe he went after her who fled

210
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:12,096
or maybe he was kidnapped by her.

211
00:13:12,096 --> 00:13:15,196
I'll try calling Conan.

212
00:13:15,196 --> 00:13:17,696
I text mailed Kei just now,

213
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,596
but I guess she wouldn't answer it if she fled.

214
00:13:20,596 --> 00:13:21,896
Mail?

215
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:24,096
-From Kei? -Yeah.

216
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:30,896
"I guess you found the corpse since you're mailing me.

217
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:34,196
I'm planning to let this boy go at daybreak

218
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:38,596
but if you interfere with me making a run for it and contact the police,

219
00:13:38,596 --> 00:13:41,496
I cannot assure the safety of this boy."

220
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:44,696
Which means that Kei killed this man after all?

221
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:46,796
It could be that she also killed the man

222
00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:50,296
who shot himself to death at the detective agency.

223
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,596
No.

224
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:56,996
But, there was practically no gun residue detected on her.

225
00:13:56,996 --> 00:14:00,796
Which means that she didn't fire the gun, doesn't it?

226
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:04,496
That's only IF, maybe, that is.

227
00:14:04,496 --> 00:14:06,596
But, we've got a problem on our hands, don't we?

228
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,496
We found another corpse

229
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:11,896
and the culprit's got Conan with her,

230
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:14,896
yet we can't do a thing till daybreak.

231
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:19,496
Only if that brat would secretly let us know where he is.

232
00:14:19,496 --> 00:14:22,596
That's right! Maybe Dr. Agasa would be able to figure it out!

233
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:24,296
Dr. Agasa?

234
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,796
Who is he?

235
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:28,896
He's an acquaintance of Conan.

236
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:33,096
And Conan usually wears a detective badge, with GPS function.

237
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:37,296
Dr. Agasa has a pair of pursuit glasses that can pinpoint Conan's location.

238
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:42,296
If something so convenient exists, please by all means contact him.

239
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:47,696
The number you have called is either switched off

240
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:50,996
or out of service range.

241
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,996
What?

242
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:01,596
Conan's been kidnapped?

243
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:03,696
Moreover, by a murderer?

244
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:06,296
Yep. That's why I want you to pursue Conan's detective badge

245
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:08,496
with the pursuit glasses!

246
00:15:08,496 --> 00:15:09,496
Okay.

247
00:15:09,496 --> 00:15:12,196
I can pursue him with my spare glasses.

248
00:15:13,196 --> 00:15:14,396
I'm sorry. I've got another call coming in.

249
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:15,696
Maybe it's from Conan.

250
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:17,696
Let me know when you find him!

251
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:19,396
Hello? Conan?

252
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:21,696
Why'd you hang up all of sudden?

253
00:15:21,696 --> 00:15:23,696
Don't you like me or what?

254
00:15:23,696 --> 00:15:25,396
Masumi.

255
00:15:25,396 --> 00:15:28,696
Sorry! A lot have been going on and I'm a bit panicked, you see.

256
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:31,796
Conan seems to be in trouble!

257
00:15:31,796 --> 00:15:33,596
Conan?

258
00:15:33,596 --> 00:15:36,796
But, how on earth do you intend to pursue him?

259
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:39,996
Isn't your Beetle out for repair right now?

260
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:42,296
Yeah. Although it's something that can't usually be done,

261
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:44,696
I guess we've got no choice but to ask the cab driver to go after him.

262
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:47,496
Would you like me to pursue him with my car, then?

263
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:50,996
I'm sorry.

264
00:15:50,996 --> 00:15:53,296
I wasn't eavesdropping or anything

265
00:15:53,296 --> 00:15:55,896
but I came to share some of this cream stew

266
00:15:55,896 --> 00:15:59,296
when I heard your disquieting conversation.

267
00:15:59,296 --> 00:16:01,896
Subaru!

268
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,396
Come, let's hurry if we're going after him.

269
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:06,596
But...

270
00:16:06,596 --> 00:16:10,996
Okay. Just lend us your car key then.

271
00:16:10,996 --> 00:16:13,196
Doc and I will go after him.

272
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:14,896
I could do so,

273
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:16,496
but that car's got a habit

274
00:16:16,496 --> 00:16:18,196
and has to be driven by me, otherwise.

275
00:16:18,196 --> 00:16:21,096
Then, why don't I pursue him together with you, Subaru.

276
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:24,396
Yes, I don't mind.

277
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:27,096
If you don't mind staying back here all alone impatiently,

278
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:31,396
waiting for word on whether he's safe or not.

279
00:16:32,596 --> 00:16:36,796
If it's okay with you, I'd recommend that you come along too.

280
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:39,996
Of course, I'm not forcing you to if you don't want to.

281
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:45,796
I see.

282
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,096
A woman called Kei Kashizuka was being held hostage

283
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:50,896
by a man who shot himself to death

284
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:52,796
in the restroom of the Mouri Detective Agency.

285
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:56,496
You gave her a lift to her condo,

286
00:16:56,496 --> 00:16:57,696
but when you got there you found

287
00:16:57,696 --> 00:17:01,096
the dead body of another man inside a suitcase there.

288
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:04,096
By the time you realized it, she had kidnapped Conan.

289
00:17:04,096 --> 00:17:06,696
Then, she mails and tells you that if you contact the police,

290
00:17:06,696 --> 00:17:08,096
his safety would not be assured?

291
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:09,396
Yup.

292
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,996
I really don't know what's going on already.

293
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:15,096
Well, if that man's belongings and the circumstances at the site

294
00:17:15,096 --> 00:17:17,896
are just as you've told me.

295
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:20,196
I think he already knows what's going on.

296
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:21,596
He?

297
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:25,296
At any rate, I'll head on over right now.

298
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:26,796
Are you coming too, Masumi?

299
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,296
Yeah.

300
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:33,896
I'd like to meet Mr. Kogoro's disciple that you've told me about too.

301
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:40,396
The smell's subsided a bit after the window was opened.

302
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:41,996
But, what shall we do?

303
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,896
Should we contact the police, after all?

304
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,996
Yeah.

305
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:49,096
But, there's something strange about this room.

306
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:52,096
What do you mean strange?

307
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:55,296
There are only men's shoes in the shoe cabinet.

308
00:17:55,296 --> 00:17:58,196
The same with the laundry and in the closet,

309
00:17:58,196 --> 00:18:00,596
all there are, are men's clothes.

310
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:03,096
Which means that the one who was living here

311
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:05,496
was just Kei's older brother who passed away?

312
00:18:05,496 --> 00:18:08,996
You mean you investigated all that in such a short time?

313
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:12,496
I'm not sure yet, but it's for sure that the resident

314
00:18:12,496 --> 00:18:14,296
of this room was very interested in a certain incident

315
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:17,496
that happened the other day.

316
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,396
A certain incident?

317
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:22,796
True.

318
00:18:22,796 --> 00:18:26,696
News and Talk and Variety shows are recorded one after the other.

319
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:30,596
Moreover, only the articles concerning the bank robbery incident

320
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:33,996
the other day are cut out and edited.

321
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:36,096
This is the video footage that's been aired since this morning

322
00:18:36,096 --> 00:18:40,396
of the three bank robbers taken on the surveillance camera.

323
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:42,996
If I remember correctly, it was a threesome

324
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,596
consisting of a small guy, thin guy and hefty guy.

325
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:47,896
That's right. The image of the hefty guy

326
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:50,496
firing the gun was also aired.

327
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,096
Although the person who was shot was out of the scene and not visible.

328
00:18:54,096 --> 00:18:57,496
Now, the funeral of the man, Mr. Kenya Shono,

329
00:18:57,496 --> 00:18:59,796
the bank clerk who intervened and was shot to death at this time,

330
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:01,196
was held last night.

331
00:19:01,196 --> 00:19:03,996
The long line of people who were touched by his action,

332
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:06,996
and attended the funeral continued until after midnight.

333
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:08,696
This man is...

334
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:11,796
Kei's older brother who was on Kei's cell phone's standby display!

335
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:15,296
But, why are their last names different?

336
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:16,796
Besides, isn't it strange?

337
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:19,496
If the person who was living here was Kei's older brother,

338
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:22,796
he couldn't have edited this morning's news?

339
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:25,196
Well, regardless of who was living here,

340
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:27,996
to think that the person kept a collection of this news

341
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:29,596
and talk and variety shows.

342
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:33,596
This person was most likely, a super crime freak,

343
00:19:33,596 --> 00:19:35,196
the bereaved member of the deceased

344
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:38,296
who had his mind set on taking revenge, or more naturally,

345
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:39,696
the bank robber himself.

346
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:41,896
True.

347
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:46,396
At any rate, let's investigate this room a bit more.

348
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:49,196
Even so, there's nowhere else to look

349
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:51,696
but the computer that is left in the bedroom already.

350
00:19:51,696 --> 00:19:54,096
Oh, uh.

351
00:19:54,096 --> 00:19:56,296
Why are you my father's disciple

352
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,096
when you're already a really sharp detective?

353
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,596
No matter how you look at it, you're way...

354
00:20:03,596 --> 00:20:07,496
Although Mouri Sensei acts to be troubled like he is now,

355
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:10,396
the fact is that he has already seen through the truth,

356
00:20:10,396 --> 00:20:13,096
and is just testing me.

357
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:16,696
It was the same during the DNA case the other day too,

358
00:20:16,696 --> 00:20:18,396
and the tragedy of the man

359
00:20:18,396 --> 00:20:21,196
who shot himself to death this afternoon occurred

360
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:22,996
because I haughtily exposed my deduction.

361
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:25,896
I'm sure that Sensei would've coped with it in a much better way!

362
00:20:25,896 --> 00:20:27,996
I'm still a mere greenhorn yet.

363
00:20:48,696 --> 00:20:50,896
I'm sorry to trouble you, Subaru.

364
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:54,296
Don't be. Then, shall we? Where to, first of all?

365
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,996
Hold it a sec.

366
00:20:57,596 --> 00:21:00,596
For now, head over to Ooishi Highway please.

367
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:02,696
I'll inform you of the details when we get closer.

368
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:04,396
Roger.

369
00:23:08,396 --> 00:23:09,396
Welcome!

370
00:23:09,396 --> 00:23:11,696
-Fill it up regular. -Yes, ma'am.

371
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:33,596
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to use the restroom.

372
00:23:33,596 --> 00:23:35,196
Yes, ma'am.

373
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:38,196
Go inside the station, and it's beyond to the right.

374
00:23:38,196 --> 00:23:40,196
Thank you.

375
00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:56,396
"Next Episode" -They've started moving again.

376
00:23:56,396 --> 00:23:59,096
-Kid. -It seems that he went with her

377
00:23:59,096 --> 00:24:01,396
on his own initiative.

378
00:24:01,396 --> 00:24:04,696
I moved to this apartment today.

379
00:24:04,696 --> 00:24:07,496
No. Maybe.

380
00:24:07,496 --> 00:24:08,796
Gun residue.

381
00:24:08,796 --> 00:24:10,796
Who on earth are you?

382
00:24:12,896 --> 00:24:16,696
Conan Edogawa.

383
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:18,396
A detective.

384
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:19,696
Next Conan,

385
00:24:19,696 --> 00:24:23,896
"Nocturne of the Detectives (Deduction)"
