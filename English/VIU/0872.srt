1
00:00:00,258 --> 00:00:03,157
"Cafe Poirot?" -What? Was it a look alike?

2
00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:04,257
No joke?

3
00:00:04,258 --> 00:00:08,357
Which means, you didn't go to the hall back then after all, Azusa?

4
00:00:08,358 --> 00:00:11,257
No. Did they look that similar?

5
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:12,258
Yes.

6
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,457
I was called at the entrance of the hall

7
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,757
and completely deceived too.

8
00:00:17,758 --> 00:00:20,357
I wonder who on earth it was.

9
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:22,357
Maybe Thief Kid?

10
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:24,457
He probably came to steal my heart.

11
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,757
No way.

12
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:28,857
Well, it was Vermouth.

13
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:32,057
But, she came all the way here to check things out so...

14
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:35,457
This probably means that the code that Koji Haneda left

15
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,657
behind 17 years ago, "Asaca Rum"

16
00:00:38,658 --> 00:00:42,357
is also a concern of the Black Organization.

17
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:45,657
I wonder what his purpose was.

18
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:47,957
It's a bit creepy.

19
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,857
Talk about creepy...

20
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:52,157
When I went out to get some groceries a while ago,

21
00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:56,057
two odd looking people went up to the detective agency.

22
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:57,657
Two odd looking people?

23
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:00,557
Were those two people dressed in black?

24
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,457
They were dressed like any other ordinary couple.

25
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,557
The dark one was her boyfriend.

26
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:07,957
Just like Mr. Amuro, he had dark skin.

27
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,357
Dark skinned?

28
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:11,757
Wasn't it Makoto?

29
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:14,257
Why would he be with a woman?

30
00:01:14,258 --> 00:01:16,857
I wonder... Beats me.

31
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:19,157
They were talking about something weird.

32
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:22,457
Something about a rag.

33
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,558
A rag?

34
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,557
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

35
00:01:28,558 --> 00:01:30,957
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

36
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,057
Rags dance in a terrifying case.

37
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:35,157
The forest where the Nue cries is a frightening place.

38
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:36,857
He sees through the one and only truth.

39
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:38,757
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

40
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:41,358
His name is Detective Conan!

41
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:26,660
"Conan and Heiji's Nue Legend (Roar Edition)"

42
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:28,860
"Mouri Detective Agency"

43
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:30,860
They weren't talking about rags,

44
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:33,161
but rather riches, buried treasure, you know!

45
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:36,460
Hidden treasure?

46
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,760
So it was him after all.

47
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,960
A letter came from the village head of a place called Yadori Village

48
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:44,660
asking Heiji to help in the excavation

49
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:47,560
because a clue to the buried treasures of Tokugawa was found.

50
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,260
So, I figured that while I was at it,

51
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:52,160
I might as well take your Dad, along with me.

52
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:53,660
I'm not going.

53
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:57,860
Because eve if it were to be the authentic buried treasures of Tokugawa

54
00:03:57,861 --> 00:04:01,161
almost all of it would become the possession of the country.

55
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:04,361
Which means you're passing, right, Pops?

56
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:06,960
Okay then, since it's a consecutive holiday,

57
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:09,560
why don't you take this kid along with you and go with them, Ran?

58
00:04:09,561 --> 00:04:13,261
But searching for buried treasures sounds kind of spooky, doesn't it?

59
00:04:14,461 --> 00:04:16,560
Let's go together, Ran.

60
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:18,460
It seems that the village head is going to pay

61
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:20,460
for our transportation too

62
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:23,860
and since the letter came to Heiji,

63
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:26,760
it could be that Shinichi also got the letter

64
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:29,260
because he's a high school detective too.

65
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:30,860
To Shinichi too?

66
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:32,160
Yeah.

67
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:35,360
Come to think of it, Shinichi mentioned some time in the past

68
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:38,160
that he was interested in searching for buried treasures,

69
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:39,660
so maybe he'll come.

70
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:40,860
Hey, hey, hey!

71
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:43,460
Yeah, that's right! So, let's go too, Ran. Okay?

72
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:45,760
Gee, what're you up to anyway?

73
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:48,560
I'm sure you don't care for buried treasures either, do you?

74
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:49,960
I don't have a choice, do I.

75
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:53,260
If she doesn't come, you won't come either, will you?

76
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:55,760
There must be something behind this.

77
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:58,860
No darn way.

78
00:04:58,861 --> 00:05:03,260
The buried treasures of Tokugawa are at Mt. Akagi in Gunma.

79
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:07,760
If an incident occurs that klutzy detective's going to show up.

80
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:09,360
Don't worry about that

81
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:12,561
because we're going to Shizuoka and not Gumna.

82
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:15,061
Shizuoka?

83
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:18,860
Hi. Welcome. Thank you for coming,

84
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,860
Mr. Heiji Hattori.

85
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:23,560
And hello to all your friends too.

86
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:26,560
I'm counting on you to excavate the buried treasures.

87
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:29,160
"Densuke Takekuma (58)" -After all, this is crucial

88
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,060
"Village head of Yadori Village" -to Yadori Village.

89
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:33,560
But, why Heiji?

90
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:37,160
There are detectives other than a high school detective, right?

91
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:39,260
Yes, but...

92
00:05:39,261 --> 00:05:41,060
since we called a historical researcher

93
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:42,860
and archaeologist too,

94
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:44,960
we ran low of funds.

95
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:46,060
No offense,

96
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:49,460
but I thought that we could get a high school detective to come

97
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:51,660
if we offered to pay transportation fee and feed him meals.

98
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:53,260
Hey.

99
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:55,660
You're going to pay us for the Bullet Train charges

100
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,560
it took us to get here, right?

101
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,461
Of course.

102
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:07,060
Hey, you! You've got to be joking!

103
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:09,761
Are you telling us to stay at this shabby hotel?

104
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:12,960
It may look that shabby on the outside

105
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:15,360
but the inside has been cleaned spic-and-span.

106
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:18,160
I've also bought loads of groceries too,

107
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:20,860
so I'll do my very best to make you good food!

108
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:22,760
You're making the food?

109
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:25,960
In the past, we had many tourists

110
00:06:25,961 --> 00:06:28,160
who came here to view Kurogane Lake there.

111
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:31,060
So, this hotel was flourishing too

112
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:32,960
but ever since that accident...

113
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:34,760
That accident...

114
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,860
What kind of accident?

115
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:38,060
Well, you know...

116
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:41,360
One of the members of the Tokugawa Buried Treasures team while excavating

117
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:44,260
"Michiki Tanzawa (62), Archaeologist" -got mixed up in a cave-in accident

118
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:46,160
and died.

119
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:47,760
Hey, hey.

120
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:51,760
Is it true that there are buried treasures near here?

121
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:56,760
Yeah. It was here at Sunpu Castle, in Shizuoka Prefecture too

122
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:59,160
that Ieyasu Tokugawa retired and passed away in.

123
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:03,160
Besides, there is a legend that goes like this too.

124
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:04,860
During the war-torn era,

125
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:08,160
Ieyasu who was almost captured by the Imagawa clan,

126
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,161
was saved by an old couple,

127
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,060
who hid and sheltered him here in Kurogane forest.

128
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:14,160
After Ieyasu subjugated and pacified the nation,

129
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:16,060
"Yasukatsu Someji (55)" -as a token of his appreciation

130
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,960
"Historical Researcher" -to the old couple and their son,

131
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:20,761
he gave them a mountain-high heap of oval gold coins.

132
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:23,160
Really?

133
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:26,660
Yeah, I think it's also written in a Japanese poem.

134
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:28,060
The light of dawn seeps through.

135
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:30,360
The light of the sunset shines on 2,000 such jars

136
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:33,460
filled with 1,000 gold coins.

137
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:37,060
It's a nursery song passed down in our village from ages ago.

138
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:38,760
Well, the phrase, "the light of dawn seeps through",

139
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:40,760
is scattered throughout the nation

140
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:45,860
as a song relating to the place of the buried treasures, but...

141
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:48,260
"Fumie Masuko (46), Novelist" -If 2,000 jars

142
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:50,860
filled with 1,000 oval gold coins were found,

143
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:52,760
it would excite every man's spirit of adventure.

144
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:55,560
Which means there are 2 million oval gold coins...

145
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:58,060
It would be fantastic if it were true.

146
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,760
No, no.

147
00:07:59,761 --> 00:08:03,260
For me, you two cuties

148
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:05,660
look more like shiny golden treasure.

149
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:06,860
Hey you!

150
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,760
What's with you?

151
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:10,760
Don't tell me that they're your girlfriends?

152
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:13,260
I'm the one that asked you the question first, you dork!

153
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:14,761
Come on and answer me, will you?

154
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:19,460
I'm a reportage that goes around throughout the nation

155
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:22,160
"Hajime Tsurumi (22), Journalist" -seeking monster legends.

156
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,761
-Mo... -Monsters?

157
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:27,061
It has nothing to do with the buried treasures.

158
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:30,260
You haven't heard?

159
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,261
Actually in this village...

160
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:34,661
Dog?

161
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:36,960
Stop it, I said!

162
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:38,860
I don't take to dogs...

163
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:40,860
-Cute. -Yeah.

164
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:43,360
It's the dog of the man of the excavating team

165
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:45,960
that I told you about a while ago.

166
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:49,560
After the accident, a neighbor who lives nearby fostered him,

167
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:53,460
but since he kept running away and coming here,

168
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:55,660
we're just letting him be.

169
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:58,960
There are lakes right behind some trees

170
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:00,560
and it can be very dangerous but,

171
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:03,260
it seems that somebody comes to feed him sometimes.

172
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:05,260
"Stay out, danger!"

173
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:07,460
What a huge sign board!

174
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:12,560
Conan, it's dangerous so you shouldn't go in there.

175
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:17,260
And are these all the people you called here today?

176
00:09:17,261 --> 00:09:19,561
Yes, well sort of...

177
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:27,360
Shinichi's not here after all.

178
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:29,460
I was planning to tell him the answer

179
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:31,860
to the question that was asked in London and yet...

180
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:33,560
And...

181
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:36,460
The thing you were telling me on the phone is true, right?

182
00:09:36,461 --> 00:09:39,060
Of course! The view is beautiful!

183
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,960
Is it better than the night view of Big Ben in London?

184
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:43,060
Of course!

185
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:45,460
It's no comparison.

186
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:47,160
I hope you're really telling the truth!

187
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:49,260
I guarantee it!

188
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:54,460
Kazuha, I'll bet Heiji asked you to come here?

189
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:57,360
Yes. He said because he knew I wasn't doing anything during the holidays.

190
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:59,760
But talking about the cave-in accident

191
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:01,260
and monster story that we heard I while ago

192
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:04,260
is only giving me bad premonitions.

193
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:06,660
No, it could be...

194
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:09,161
A presentiment of romance.

195
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:17,260
I'm filled.

196
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm really stuffed.

197
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,160
The potted dish was really delicious, wasn't it?

198
00:10:21,161 --> 00:10:23,060
Thank you, sir.

199
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:25,361
No, problem. Don't mention it.

200
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:31,860
Now, I'll put rice in the pot,

201
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:34,661
pour mixed eggs into it...

202
00:10:36,561 --> 00:10:38,860
And if you mix it like this with chopsticks, walla.

203
00:10:38,861 --> 00:10:41,160
Super delicious porridge is made.

204
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:42,560
You're going to mix it?

205
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:46,060
The egg will be fluffier if you just put the lid over it.

206
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,660
It's better if you mix it

207
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:50,460
because you can taste the egg in every bite.

208
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:51,860
And?

209
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:54,160
Tell me about the monster story

210
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:55,760
that you were going to tell me a while ago.

211
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:58,260
That?

212
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:00,660
Among that excavation team there was a foreigner

213
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,160
by the name of Charles Abel

214
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,160
who spoke a few words of Japanese.

215
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:08,360
That foreigner was the man who got into the cave-in accident,

216
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:10,960
and when the other members of the team got to him,

217
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,360
he was still alive.

218
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,660
He was stuck between two rocks

219
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:15,760
and was trying to say something

220
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:18,460
so they asked him if he found something.

221
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:22,560
But he hurt his throat and couldn't talk.

222
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:25,860
Then one of the members handed him a notebook and pen.

223
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:32,660
He took it and slowly wrote three alphabets.

224
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:37,560
The members who saw the letters froze with fear.

225
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:39,960
Because on that paper,

226
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:42,760
the word Nue was written on it!

227
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:43,761
Nue...

228
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:44,761
Was written?

229
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:47,260
Nue... Don't tell me that...

230
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:50,360
It's the monster that appears a lot in old folklore?

231
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:53,160
Right. It has the head of a monkey,

232
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:54,460
the body of a badger,

233
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:55,860
its legs and arms a like that of a tiger,

234
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:57,260
and the tail of a snake.

235
00:11:57,261 --> 00:12:01,160
It appears along with black smoke and an eerie roar.

236
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:05,460
It's an ancient monster said to bring upon misfortune!

237
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:08,760
Are you saying that the monster was beyond inside the cave?

238
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,360
Yeah. What else could it have been?

239
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:15,060
That's why I was invited here.

240
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:20,060
To tell the world about the existence of the monster

241
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:22,461
that plunged the excavation team into the depths of fear!

242
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:27,460
What do you think you're doing, hag?

243
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:30,960
How dare you gleefully recount a person's death!

244
00:12:30,961 --> 00:12:33,761
You've ruined the porridge.

245
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:38,160
I sort of thought that your novels were somewhat similar

246
00:12:38,161 --> 00:12:40,060
to what he just said though?

247
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:42,060
Indeed?

248
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,460
It's hard to believe that those words came from you just now,

249
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:48,360
because of the grotesque way that you describe

250
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:49,660
one being eaten to death by the monster.

251
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:53,060
Oh, my... Should I be leaving?

252
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:55,760
Well, well everyone, let's cool off here.

253
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:58,060
Let's all sleep well tonight

254
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:01,561
and tomorrow morning let's hall head off to the excavation site.

255
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:12,161
What's this eerie sounding thing?

256
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:18,860
How unusual.

257
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:20,160
Is it here...

258
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:21,460
In this forest too?

259
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:23,160
It's here?

260
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:25,361
What's this sound?

261
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:28,061
It's the cry of...

262
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:32,161
The Nue.

263
00:13:37,696 --> 00:13:39,895
Nue's cry?

264
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:42,395
Don't tell me that it's in this forest?

265
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:46,095
You mean that monster that appears in old folklore?

266
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:48,995
It's not the monster, but the bird.

267
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,896
Bird?

268
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:55,995
The bird called White's Thrush used to be called Nue.

269
00:13:55,996 --> 00:13:58,595
They favor living in hillocks, low mountains,

270
00:13:58,596 --> 00:14:00,995
and broad-leaved forests.

271
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:03,695
The monsters that used to appear in the Tale of Heike cried

272
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:06,295
in a similar way as the Nue bird,

273
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:09,296
so it was named as such.

274
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:16,695
I didn't think White's Thrush lived around here.

275
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:18,795
How unusual...

276
00:14:18,796 --> 00:14:20,795
So, maybe the bird that the foreigner

277
00:14:20,796 --> 00:14:26,095
who got into the cave-in accident saw was also that bird?

278
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:28,295
Because the only three alphabets he wrote on the memo

279
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:33,096
just before he died spelled the word Nue.

280
00:14:35,996 --> 00:14:37,495
What the heck are you talking about?

281
00:14:37,496 --> 00:14:40,995
That foreigner saw it at the cave of the excavation site, you know?

282
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:42,895
It couldn't have been a bird!

283
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:44,795
It was really there!

284
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:46,195
Deep inside the cave...

285
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:49,096
The legendary monster, Nue!

286
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:54,495
But, it's not that someone who is alive now

287
00:14:54,496 --> 00:14:57,995
saw that monster back then, right?

288
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:01,195
Well, I guess we can't say it's completely baloney.

289
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:03,995
Long ago, in the northwest of Lake Hamana, in Shizuoka Prefecture here,

290
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:06,095
the corpse of a Nue came falling.

291
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:09,395
The names of the towns called Mikkabicho, Nueshiro,

292
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:11,495
Dohzaki, Hanehira and Ona,

293
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:12,995
that all are a part of Hamamatsu city, Kita ward,

294
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,795
are each said to correspond to Nue's head,

295
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:18,595
body, wings, and tails.

296
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:20,395
The paws and legs of the Nue

297
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:24,396
are said to have fallen here in Yadori Village too.

298
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:26,295
Yadorimura in the past,

299
00:15:26,296 --> 00:15:29,695
used to be written as night and bird,

300
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:33,696
therefore, resulting in the kanji character Nue.

301
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:39,096
So, this cry that we're hearing may not be a bird but rather...

302
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:44,996
It stopped crying?

303
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:50,495
Hey, let's go home already.

304
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:53,195
But, we came all the way here.

305
00:15:53,196 --> 00:15:59,195
And all those monster stories are heard second-hand.

306
00:15:59,196 --> 00:16:02,395
The foreigner who wrote "Nue" at his death

307
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,895
can't be trusted either.

308
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:07,195
I've got that paper!

309
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:08,496
You've got the paper?

310
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:15,395
See. "Nue" is written here, right?

311
00:16:15,396 --> 00:16:16,795
After the cave-in accident,

312
00:16:16,796 --> 00:16:18,095
when the previous village head dug out the foreigner,

313
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:20,395
he found this near the body.

314
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:26,495
It's been kept at the village hall for 16 years since then

315
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:28,695
together with this old beat up hair pin

316
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,496
that was found together with the paper.

317
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:35,695
If that foreigner was the dog's owner,

318
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:38,595
this dog must be pretty old too.

319
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:41,695
It may die any day now.

320
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:45,795
It seems to still have been a puppy when the man had it, though.

321
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:49,195
What was found recently was this notebook with a page

322
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:52,095
that perfectly matches the torn edge of this piece of paper.

323
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:57,395
It details where and how the team was excavating the cave

324
00:16:57,396 --> 00:16:59,995
and on what basis of information.

325
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:02,895
If we could go to the cave tomorrow

326
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:08,495
and describe where the buried treasure could be in front of the camera,

327
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:12,195
you'd be you'd be doing Yadori Village a huge favor.

328
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:13,295
I see.

329
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:15,595
He wants to make a video to revitalize this village.

330
00:17:15,596 --> 00:17:20,396
So, he never expected us to find any buried treasure to begin with.

331
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:26,995
Please rest well, everyone.

332
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:30,996
Did you get the beverages I requested?

333
00:17:31,796 --> 00:17:34,895
I can't sleep well without it.

334
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:36,995
Now that you've mentioned it, what about my sake?

335
00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:38,195
And mine?

336
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:41,395
Yes, yes! I've bought them all.

337
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:44,395
I'll deliver them to your rooms later.

338
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,895
Milk and whiskey for Mr. Someji.

339
00:17:46,896 --> 00:17:50,295
For Mr. Tanzawa, Japanese sake and dried cuttlefish.

340
00:17:50,296 --> 00:17:52,995
Ms. Masuko, white wine and carbonated water

341
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:56,995
and Cola and potato chips for Mr. Tsurumi, correct?

342
00:17:56,996 --> 00:18:00,095
I'll just drink out of the bottle, so I don't need a cup.

343
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:01,695
Yes, sir.

344
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:04,895
Shall I bring something for your party too, Mr. Hattori?

345
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:06,595
No need!

346
00:18:06,596 --> 00:18:08,395
-Right? -Yeah.

347
00:18:08,396 --> 00:18:09,795
Taking too much liquids

348
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:12,495
may want to make me go to the restroom in the middle of the night.

349
00:18:12,496 --> 00:18:16,395
Rather, I'm worried whether I can sleep tonight or not.

350
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:17,396
Yeah.

351
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:21,695
Make sure you check your room thoroughly before going to bed.

352
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:23,795
There was a desiccated mouse corpse

353
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:26,595
in the desk drawer of my room.

354
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:27,895
-What? -What?

355
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:31,896
That's strange I cleaned it thoroughly.

356
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,195
If you two are so scared,

357
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:37,196
would you like to sleep with me in my room?

358
00:18:38,396 --> 00:18:41,295
You go and sleep with the mice!

359
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:42,896
I totally agree!

360
00:18:54,096 --> 00:18:55,496
A letter?

361
00:18:56,796 --> 00:18:58,296
What're you doing?

362
00:18:59,896 --> 00:19:01,595
If you want to open the drawer,

363
00:19:01,596 --> 00:19:03,195
why don't you get to it?

364
00:19:03,196 --> 00:19:04,395
But...

365
00:19:04,396 --> 00:19:07,195
I don't want any mice coming out.

366
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:09,096
There's nothing like that inside.

367
00:19:12,396 --> 00:19:13,995
Something's inside.

368
00:19:13,996 --> 00:19:16,895
"Notebook" -It looks like an old notebook.

369
00:19:16,896 --> 00:19:18,395
I wonder who it belongs to?

370
00:19:18,396 --> 00:19:20,096
I wonder if somebody forgot it?

371
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,995
Creepy.

372
00:19:25,996 --> 00:19:29,395
A lot of the same words are written.

373
00:19:29,396 --> 00:19:31,296
What is it?

374
00:19:32,396 --> 00:19:35,695
The foreign excavator who died

375
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,895
must've been practicing hiragana, maybe?

376
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:39,395
-What? -See!

377
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:43,195
Charles Abel is written in hiragana on the back of the notebook.

378
00:19:43,196 --> 00:19:44,995
So, this room must be the room

379
00:19:44,996 --> 00:19:48,695
that the foreigner who died was using?

380
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:50,096
It's bright outside.

381
00:19:52,596 --> 00:19:53,596
What is it?

382
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:57,995
It's burning in front of the hotel!

383
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:58,996
-What? -What?

384
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,195
Fire!

385
00:20:00,196 --> 00:20:02,296
Hurry, get out of here! Fire!

386
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:08,396
"Stay out, danger!"

387
00:20:09,396 --> 00:20:11,696
Who would do something like this?

388
00:20:18,396 --> 00:20:20,495
It's Nue.

389
00:20:20,496 --> 00:20:23,896
The Nue came along with the black smoke.

390
00:20:26,196 --> 00:20:27,495
Idiot!

391
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:30,595
-A thing like that doesn't exist. -Heiji!

392
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,696
Look at that.

393
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:41,595
Humongous.

394
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:43,096
What the heck?

395
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:54,196
It ran away.

396
00:20:55,196 --> 00:20:56,196
Darn.

397
00:20:56,197 --> 00:20:58,795
The trees are in the way so we can't go after it from here.

398
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:00,895
Village head, get the fire extinguisher!

399
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:02,495
Use all the extinguishers that you have here

400
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:03,695
and put out the fire!

401
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:04,895
Okay.

402
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,495
Kazuha, you guys help put out the fire too!

403
00:21:07,496 --> 00:21:08,995
What about you, Heiji?

404
00:21:08,996 --> 00:21:11,095
Don't ask stupid questions, idiot!

405
00:21:11,096 --> 00:21:13,895
I'm going around back to expose the identity of that monster!

406
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:14,996
-Wait! -Conan!

407
00:21:22,996 --> 00:21:24,995
Look at these teeth marks!

408
00:21:24,996 --> 00:21:26,395
Yeah.

409
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:28,495
But, it's odd.

410
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,895
I came around from back and yet...

411
00:21:30,896 --> 00:21:33,895
We didn't pass that monster.

412
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:37,295
Don't tell me that it slipped through the trees

413
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,996
and maybe it fled into the lake?

414
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:45,796
Blood?

415
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:52,496
It goes all the way towards the lake.

416
00:22:00,296 --> 00:22:02,195
Isn't that Mr. Someiji?

417
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,095
Is he passed out?

418
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:06,796
No, he's already dead.

419
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:11,195
He's got claw marks on him

420
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,296
as if he were attacked by a beast.

421
00:23:42,596 --> 00:23:44,395
"Next Episode" -He was dead?

422
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:48,995
It's Nue. He was killed by that huge beast.

423
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:51,095
That's some sort of a trick.

424
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,395
This burnt area smells of kerosene too.

425
00:23:54,396 --> 00:23:55,795
What's with that fire?

426
00:23:55,796 --> 00:23:57,796
Beats me. It broke out just like that.

427
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:02,896
What was that scream?

428
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:08,595
Next Conan,

429
00:24:08,596 --> 00:24:12,396
"Conan and Heiji's Nue Legend (Claw Traces Edition)"
